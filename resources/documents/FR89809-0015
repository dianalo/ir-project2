TheFMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council)under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act(Magnuson Act). The FMP is implemented by regulations appearing at 50 CFR611.93 and part 675.The Council approved Amendment 12a to the FMP at its January 16-19, 1989meeting for submission to the Secretary for review, approval and implementationunder sections 304(a) and 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. The Secretary receivedAmendment 12a on April 4, 1989 and immediately began a review to determineits consistency with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The Director,Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) determined that the amendment wasconsistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. A notice ofavailability of Amendment 12A was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 10, 1989 (54 FR 14256, correction at54 FR 15302, April 17, 1989). Proposed implementing regulations were publishedon May 4, 1989 (54 FR 19199, correction at 54 FR 21343, May 17, 1989).The corrected notice of availability invited public review and commentuntil June 5, 1989 and the corrected notice of proposed rulemaking invitedcomments until June 12, 1989. Thirteen letters commenting on the amendmentand its proposed implementing regulations were received and consideredin developing this final rule. Several minor changes were made betweenthe proposed and final rules for clarification purposes and are describedlater. A summary of, and response to, all comments received is given below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description </ITAG>The purpose of Amendment 12A is to limit incidental catches of <T3>Chionoecetes bairdi </T3>Tanner crab, red king crab (<T3>Paralithodes camtschatica</T3>), and Pacific halibut (<T3>Hippoglossus stenolepis</T3>) by the groundfish fisheries in the BSAIarea and thus minimize the impact of domestic groundfish fisheries on thesespecies. Such incidental catches are referred to as bycatches in fisheriestargeting other species. The FMP and its implementing regulations definethese species of crabs and halibut as prohibited species which, if caughtwhile fishing for groundfish, must be returned to the sea with a minimumof injury (andSection; 675.20(c)). Amendment 12a reflects an effort to balancepotentially excessive bycatches of prohibited species in the groundfishfishery against added operating costs resulting from bycatch control regulations.As such, the Council has determined that the bycatch controls imposed bythis amendment will provide the domestic groundfish fishery sufficientopportunity to harvest the total allowable catch of groundfish while keepingthe wasteful discard of incidentally harvested prohibited species to areasonable minimum. To achieve this purpose, the Council proposed specification of prohibitedspecies catch (PSC) limits for <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crab, red king crab and halibut and apportionmentof these PSC limits among four specified groundfish fisheries. When a specifiedfishery reaches its apportionment of the PSC limit, it will be prohibitedfrom fishing in certain areas or bycatch limitation zones for the remainderof the fishing year. A full description of Amendment 12A is given in thepreamble to the proposed rule. The following is a summary of what it willaccomplish. <ITAG tagnum="84">Bycatch Limitation Zones</ITAG>Three bycatch limitation zones are established (see Figure 2). Zones 1and 2 would be identical to those under Amendment 10 to the FMP. A newhalibut protection zone, Zone 2H, is established in that part of Zone 2that is south of 56anddegrees;30andmin172; N. latitude and between 165anddegrees;and 170anddegrees; W. longitude. These zones describe areas in which craband halibut stocks are especially abundant. Approximately 88 percent ofthe total red king crab population of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islandsis estimated to be within Zone 1. About 98 percent of the <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crab population of the Bering Sea and AleutianIslands is estimated to be within Zones 1 and 2 combined and about 60 percentin only Zone 2. Pacific halibut are more broadly distributed in the BeringSea than are crab species. However, Zones 1 and 2H combined encompass anarea known for high abundance of juvenile halibut and for seasonal migrationof halibut between deep and shallower continental shelf waters. Sequentialclosing of these zones to groundfish fisheries which have attained theirshare of the PSC limits provides for a reduction in bycatch rates withoutprohibiting the fisheries access to all Bering Sea groundfish resources.An area within Zone 1, south of 58anddegrees; N. latitude and between 160anddegrees;and 162anddegrees; W. longitude, is closed to all fishing with trawl gear.The western boundary of this closed area will be extended to 163anddegrees;W. longitude during the period March 15 through June 15. This closed areawill protect a significant portion of the red king crab and <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crab stock from trawl gear. An exception to theclosed area and its seasonal extension is provided in that part of thearea south of a line approximating the 25 fathom isobath. This exceptionapplies only to directed fishing for Pacific cod, provided that a PSC limitof 12,000 red king crabs is not exceeded. The purpose of this exceptionis to allow fishing for Pacific cod in that part of the closed area inwhich crab bycatch has been demonstrated to be relatively low. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fisheries</ITAG>For purposes of this action, two domestic annual processing (DAP) fisheriesand two joint venture processing (JVP) fisheries are defined as follows:(a) ``DAP flatfish fishery'' means DAP fishing which, on a weekly basis,retains yellowfin sole, rock sole, and ``other flatfish'' in the aggregatethat is 20 percent or more of the total amount of groundfish retained.(b) ``DAP other fishery'' means DAP fishing which, on a weekly basis, retainsany other combination of groundfish species that would not qualify suchfishing as a ``flatfish fishery.''(c) ``JVP flatfish fishery'' means JVP fishing which, on a weekly basis,delivers yellowfin sole, rock sole, and ``other flatfish'' in the aggregateto foreign vessels that is 20 percent or more of the total amount of groundfishdelivered.(d) ``JVP other fishery'' means JPV fishing which, on a weekly basis, deliversto foreign vessels any other combination of groundfish species that wouldnot qualify such fishing as a ``flatfish fishery.''Foreign directed fishing would not be affected by this rule. Existing PSClimits specified in the foreign fishing regulations (andSection;611.93) wouldapply to foreign fishing if any allocation of groundfish in the BSAI areais made to foreign directed fishing during the effective period of thisrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">PSC Limits</ITAG>For <T3>C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab, the PSC limit is 1,000,000 animals in Zone1 and 3,000,000 animals in Zone 2. For red king crab, which are distributedalmost entirely within Zone 1, the PSC limit is 200,000 animals in Zone1. Bycatches of these crab species within the two bycatch limitation zoneswould be counted against the respective PSC limits. The PSC limit for Pacifichalibut is applied differently. Because halibut are more broadly distributedthan crabs, bycatches of halibut anywhere in the BSAI area are countedagainst a primary PSC limit of 4,400 metric tons (mt) which would leadto closures of Zones 1 and 2H and a secondary PSC limit of 5,333 mt whichwould trigger a closure of the entire BSAI area.These PSC limits were the subject of negotiations between trawl fishingindustry representatives and those of the crab and halibut fishing industries.Determination of the PSC limits began with the best available scientificinformation on the abundance and distribution of the specified crab andhalibut species, and their rate of bycatch in fisheries for certain speciesof groundfish, and proceeded in public meetings of the Council's BycatchCommittee during 1987 and 1988. In addition, the Council heard extensivepublic debate and testimony during 1988 and at its January 1989 meetingon this issue. Although a consensus was not achieved and some PSB limitsremain controversial, the Council determined that the bycatch control measuresin Amendment 12a achieve the desired balance between excessive bycatchand unreasonably prohibitive bycatch control. Due to the unique blend ofallocative and biological concerns represented in this bycatch controlissue, the Secretary is not substituting his judgement for that of theCouncil's in determining that the PSC limits should be, if any. Instead,the Secretary limited review of Amendment 12a to the question of whetherthe Council's recommended PSC limits are consistent with the Magnuson Actand other applicable law. NOAA has determined, and the Secretary has concurredwith the finding, that they are consistent with applicable statutes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Apportionment, Monitoring and Enforcement of PSC Limits</ITAG>Each PSC limit will be apportioned among the four specified fisheries inproportion to the anticipated bycatch of each fishery. Anticipated bycatchesfor a fishing year will be derived from a mathematical model which predictsthe total annual unconstrained bycatch by each fishery based on known orestimated bycatches from the most recent previous years. The proportionof a fishery's predicted bycatch to the total predicted bycatch of a specieswill be the share of that species' PSC limit apportioned to that fishery,or its PSC allowance, in that fishing year. Each PSC allowance will be determined annually by the Regional Directorin consultation with the Council and made available for public commentconcurrently with the notice of preliminary initial specification of harvestableamounts of groundfish required under andSection;675.20(a)(6). A final noticeof PSC allowances also will be published concurrent with the final noticeof initial specifications. Existing authority to make inseason adjustmentsto PSC allowances is revised to allow correction of a PSC allowance thatwas initially incorrectly specified due to a calculation error or wrongassumption in predicting a fishery's bycatch.Since this amendment is implemented during 1989, the above procedure forspecifying PSC allowances for the 1989 fishing year was not followed exactly.Instead, proposed PSC allowances were published in Table 2 of the proposedrule (at 54 FR 19205) and comments on them were specifically requested.No comments on the proposed PSC allowances per se were received. The PSCallowances in Table 2 of this notice serve as the final notice of initialspecification of the PSC allowances for the 1989 fishing year.Observed or estimated bycatches of crabs and halibut caught with groundfishwill be counted and totals estimated using standard statistical procedures.The total bycatch of crabs and halibut reported or estimated for any oneweek (Sunday through Saturday) reporting period will be credited to thebycatch allowance of the DAP or JVP ``flatfish fishery'' if the total amountof groundfish retained or delivered during that reporting period is composedin the aggregate of 20 percent or more of yellowfin sole, rock sole, and``other flatfish.'' If the total amount of groundfish retained or deliveredin any one week reporting period is composed of any other combination ofgroundfish species which does not qualify as ``flatfish,'' then the totalamount of crabs and halibut taken as bycatch during that week will be creditedto the bycatch allowance of the DAP of JVP ``other fishery.'' In the absenceof observers on DAP fishing vessels, crab and halibut bycatches in theDAP fisheries will be calculated from estimated bycatch rates, based onthe best available information.For DAP bycatch accounting purposes, discriminating between the ``flatfish''and ``other'' fisheries will be based on a blend of data from the weeklycatch/receipt reports required of catcher/processors and mothership/processorsunder andSection;675.5(a)(3)(iv) and the fish ticket reports required ofall DAP fishing vessels under andSection;675.5(a)(1). For purposes of determiningwhen a PSC allowance for a DAP fishery will be attained, the Regional Directormay forecast bycatches of crabs and halibut based on recent weekly catch/receiptand fish ticket reports and any pertinent observer reports.Any catch of groundfish by U.S. fishermen, on a weekly basis, will occurwithin one of the four specified fisheries as defined above and bycatcheswill be credited accordingly against the PSC allowance of the respectivefishery. Theoretically, PSC limits will not be exceeded since attainmentof a fishery's PSC allowance in a bycatch limitation zone or area willtrigger closure of that fishery in that zone or area. For example, whenthe ``DAP flatfish fishery'' attains its PSC allowance of either <T3>C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab or red king crab in Zone 1, then the Secretarywill prohibit DAP directed fishing for yellowfin sole, rock sole, and ``otherflatfish'' for the remainder of the fishing year in Zone 1. Directed fishingis defined at andSection;675.2. Attainment of a PSC allowance of an ``otherfishery'' however, would not trigger closure of directed fishing for allother species. Instead, this rule provides only for the closure of directedfishing for Pacific cod and pollock with bottom trawl gear when the PSCallowance of the ``other fishery'' is attained. Fishing for other speciesin the ``other fishery'' with bottom trawl gear and fishing with off-bottomor mid-water trawl gear could continue. The reason for this differencebetween responding to attainment of the PSC allowance of the ``flatfishfishery'' and that of the ``other fishery'' is that bycatches of halibutand crabs appear to be significant in the ``other fishery'' only when fishermentarget Pacific cod and pollock with bottom trawl gear.In addition, the monitoring of the PSC allowances for halibut differs somewhatfrom that of the PSC allowances for crabs. A fishery's bycatches of redking crab and <T3>C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab taken within a bycatch limitation zone thataccrue to a crab PSC allowance for that zone will trigger closure of thatzone to that fishery. Bycatches of Pacific halibut anywhere in the BSAIarea, however, accrue to the primary and secondary PSC allowances for halibut.Attainment of the primary PSC allowance by a fishery will trigger closureof Zones 1 and 2H to that fishery. If that fishery subsequently attainsits secondary PSC allowance, it will be prohibited from the entire BSAIarea. The reason for this difference in enforcing the PSC allowances ofcrabs and halibut is that halibut are more broadly distributed on the easternBering Sea shelf than are crabs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Changes From the Proposed Rule in the Final Rule</ITAG>No substantive changes are made in the final rule as a result of reviewof and comment on the proposed rule. Several minor wording changes in thepreamble and regulatory text are made to improve clarity, however. Thefirst involved a slight change in the definition of a DAP or JVP ``otherfishery.'' In the proposed rule and preamble, a DAP other fishery means``DAP fishing which, on a weekly basis, retained groundfish that is 95percent or more pollock, or 50 percent or more pollock and Pacific codin the aggregate, or any other combination of groundfish species that wouldnot qualify such fishing as a ``flatfish fishery.'' Similar language wasused with respect to the meaning of a JVP ``other fishery.'' NOAA consideredthis definition too cumbersome since the operative language is ``* * *any combination of groundfish species that would not qualify such fishingas a ``flatfish fishery.'' A weekly aggregate catch of groundfish thatis retained by a DAP operation or delivered to foreign vessels in a JVPoperation must be categorized as either a ``flatfish fishery'' or an ``otherfishery'' for bycatch accounting purposes. There is no way for a weeklyaggregate of groundfish to be categorized differently. To make this intentand meaning clear, the phrase ``groundfish that is 95 percent or more pollock,or 50 percent or more pollock and Pacific cod in the aggregate, or,'' isdeleted from the preamble and regulatory text of the final rule (andSection;675.21(b)(3) (ii) and (iv)).The second change involves the Secretary's inseason management authorityat andSection; 675.20(e)(4). This paragraph provides for the adjustment ofa TAC, PSC limit or PSC allowance that is determined by the Regional Directorto be incorrectly specified given the actual performance of a fishery duringthe fishing season which is different from that predicted. The inseasonmanagement authority accommodates such differences by allowing discretionto correct previously specified PSC allowances. To clarify this authorityin a way which is consistent with the preamble of the proposed rule point,NOAA had added the words ``and harvest'' to the first sentence of andSection;675.20(e)(4) after the phrase ``* * * concerning the biological stock status* * *'' and added the phrase ``or to allow redistribution of uncaught PSCallowances among fisheries'' at the end of the paragraph.Another change from the proposed rule to the final rule involves languagein andSection; 675.20(e)(4). The adjective ``best'' is added before ``availablescientific information'' and the phrase ``and harvest'' is added after``biological stock status'' to indicate that harvest data will also beused by the Regional Director to determine correctness of PSC limits andPSC allowances for a given species.Also, in the proposed rule the latitude for one of the coordinates forthe definition of <T3>Bycatch Limitation Zone 2H</T3>, was incorrectly listed as 55anddegrees;44andmin16;. This latitude in the final rule has been corrected to read 55anddegrees;42andmin16;.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received</ITAG>Fourteen letters of comment on the proposed rule were received prior tothe end of the comment period on June 12, 1989. Three letters of commentwere received after the close of the comment period, but the substanceof these letters presented no issue or point of view uniquely differentfrom the other letters. Most of the letters in opposition to the proposedrule reiterated common themes such as discontent with the restrictivenessof the rule and questioned its fairness. Similar comments are summarizedas a single comment. All unique comments are treated separately.<T3>Comment 1</T3>: The PSC limits are too low, unnecessarily restrictive,and will cause severe economic impacts in excess of $100 million on thetrawl fisheries when areas are closed. As such, Amendment 12A constitutesa ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291). PSC limits shouldnot be expressed as fixed amounts but rather as proportions of the totalpopulation of the prohibited species in the area.<T3>Response</T3>: This opinion was reiterated in most of the letters writtenin opposition to Amendment 12A. It reflects a view that any bycatch limitis too low that inhibits the catch of groundfish by a fisherman with an``average'' unconstrained bycatch rate. This view is inconsistent withthe Council's policy of limiting the bycatch of crabs and halibut in thegroundfish fisheries to less than what would be taken in unconstrainedgroundfish fisheries. The objective of Amendment 12a is to reduce the biologicaland economic effect of the groundfish fisheries on fisheries for crabsand halibut from what it would be without such control. This action implementingAmendment 12a is intended to modify unconstrained fishing behavior so asto reduce bycatch rates.There is no question that modifying behavior by requiring compliance witha rule is achieved at some cost. NOAA would agree that a rule is unnecessarilyrestrictive if the cost of compliance is excessive relative to its biological,economic, social and environmental benefits. In this instance, the behaviormodification cost to trawlers is not clear. Although the regulatory impactanalysis indicates that forgone groundfish and profits to the groundfishfishery under this rule could produce negative benefits, such a scenariois based on an assumption that trawl fishermen will not modify their fishingbehavior from what it would be with no bycatch controls. NOAA does notbelieve that this scenario, although analytically useful, is realistic.The groundfish trawl fishing fleet is more likely to respond to the potentialfor lost revenues by modifying fishing patterns and practices to reducebycatch rates, and thereby mitigate any negative impacts on their profits.The Council heard considerable public testimony at its January 1989 meetingthat, given imposition of the Amendment 12a bycatch controls, the groundfishfishery would use all available technology and expertise to reduce thebycatch of crabs and halibut to avoid costly area closures. In addition,NOAA is persuaded by the positive response to similar bycatch limits imposedon the foreign fisheries in 1983 and on the JVP fishery in 1985 which resultedin substantial reduction in observed bycatch rates without apparently costingthose fisheries significant forgone groundfish harvests.In any event, this action has been thoroughly reviewed for consistencywith E.O. 12291 and other applicable law. To the extent that net quantifiablebenefits may not occur despite the best efforts of trawl operators to reducebycatches by modifying fishing behavior, unquantifiable environmental benefitsstill warrant taking this action. Such benefits include the reduction ofcrab and halibut mortality from encounters with trawl gear that do notresult in their capture.NOAA agrees that PSC limits expressed as a proportion would better accommodatechanges in population abundance of crabs and halibut. This rule, in whichthe PSC limits are established as fixed amounts, however, will be effectiveonly through 1990, or less than 18 months. In addition, the recommendedPSC limits are based on the most recent (1988) estimates of crab and halibutpopulation sizes. Therefore, NOAA finds that the recommended PSC limitsas fixed amounts are acceptable.<T3>Comment 2</T3>: The PSC limits on crabs violate National Standards1, 2 and 4. The proposed rule violates National Standard 4 in that it discriminatesbetween categories of U.S. harvesters and does not allocate PSC limitsfairly and equitably. The proposed bycatch controls are not equitable inthat crab bycatches in the crab fishery may be far in excess of bycatchesin the trawl fishery. Amendment 12a ignores the bycatches of the longline(pot and hook) fisheries for groundfish. The assumption that the trawlfleet is the culprit in the bycatch issue is unfounded and there is inequityin the treatment between trawl and other gear types.<T3>Response:</T3> National Standard 1 requires management measures toprevent overfishing while achieving optimum yield from each fishery (MagnusonAct section 301(a)(1)). The prescribed PSC limits serve to prevent overfishingof crab stocks by imposing a constraining limit on crab bycatches in thegroundfish fishery, even though the bycatch mortality of crabs from trawlgear is not solely responsible for changes in crab abundance. In the sameway, the PSC limits also assure that the optimum yield in the crab fisheryis achieved insofar as impacts from the groundfish fishery affect thatoptimum yield of crabs. Achievement of the optimum yield of groundfishis assumed, providing trawl operators respond positively to the incentiveto reduce their bycatch rates. In making this assumption, NOAA relies onprevious experience controlling the prohibited species bycatches in theforeign and JVP groundfish fisheries.National standard 2 requires that management measures be based on the bestavailable scientific information. After review of the environmental andregulatory impact analysis supporting this action, NOAA finds that it isconsistent with this standard. The analysis is based largely on crab distributionand abundance estimates derived from the 1988 crab survey of the EasternBering Sea performed by NMFS crab biologists. These estimates will notbe revised until after the 1989 survey is complete, probably in September1989. Bycatch assumptions used in the analysis are based on observed bycatchrates in the 1987 and 1988 JVP groundfish fisheries. NOAA recognizes thestatistical limitations of its crab biomass estimates and of extrapolatingthe performance of DAP fisheries from JVP fisheries. However, a betterand equally practical analytical approach is not apparent.National Standard 4 prohibits management measures from discriminating betweenresidents of different states and requires any allocation of fishing privilegesto be fair and equitable, to promote conservation, and be carried out sothat no particular individual, corporation or other entity acquires anexcessive share of such privileges. The bycatch restrictions of this ruledo not discriminate between residents of different states as trawl fishermenfrom all states are equally burdened to operate within the specified PSClimits.Inherent in any allocation is the advantaging of one group to the detrimentof another. To be fair and equitable, an allocation of fishing privilegesshould be rationally connected to the achievement of optimum yield andto an objective of an approved fishery management plan. For the reasonsdiscussed in response to the previous comment, NOAA believes that the bycatchcontrol measures imposed by this rule enhance the achievement of the optimumyield to the red king and <T3>C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab fisheries while not necessarily preventingachievement of the groundfish optimum yield. Hence, these bycatch controlmeasures are rationally connected to the achievement of the optimum yieldsof crabs and groundfish. Moreover, they serve to carry out one of the expressedmanagement objectives of the FMP, that is, to minimize the impact of groundfishfisheries on prohibited species such as crabs and halibut (FMP at section14.1).In addition, an allocation scheme may promote conservation (in the senseof wise use) by optimizing yield in terms of size, value, market mix, price,or economic or social benefit of the product. The observed bycatch of crabsand halibut in the groundfish trawl fishery is composed mostly of small,pre-recruit animals. By catching and discarding these animals with probable100 percent mortality, the groundfish fishery preempts the productive useof the discards in the crab and halibut fisheries and the associated economicand social benefits. On the other hand, PSC limits that prevent harvestingthe groundfish optimum yield when every effort is made by that fisheryto avoid excessive bycatches also would not be considered wise use of thecrab and halibut resources. This is the essence of the allocative balancebetween allowing relatively unconstrained fishing for groundfish with trawlgear and limiting that fishery's use of other resources that may have potentiallyadverse affects on other fisheries. After lengthy debate and study, theCouncil appears to have made a reasonable management recommendation thatstrikes an appropriate balance between these competing interests.NOAA recognizes the difficult judgement necessary in making such allocativemanagement decisions. By implementing the Council's bycatch control recommendationsin Amendment 12a, NOAA is not making any assumption that the trawl fleetis the culprit in the bycatch issue. Although it is true that about 82percent of the catcher vessels with current Federal permits to harvestgroundfish off Alaska operate longline (pots and hooks) gear, about 92percent of the groundfish harvest through June 10, 1989 has been takenby trawl gear. While bycatch data on the groundfish longline fisheriesare scant, based on the relative distribution of groundfish harvest amonggear types it may be assumed that trawl gear takes most of the total prohibitedspecies bycatch taken in all groundfish fisheries.The bycatch of red king crabs in the <T3>C. bairdi</T3> Tanner crab fishery also is acknowledged along withthe bycatch of female and small male red king crabs in the red king crabfishery. The control of such bycatches is properly done by the State ofAlaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFandamp;G) in cooperation with theCouncil under terms of the fishery management plan for Bering Sea crabs.The ADFandamp;G closed the Tanner crab fishery in the Bering Sea on May 7,1989 partly because of excessive red king crab bycatches (ADFandamp;G emergencyorder no. 4-S-09-89). Other reasons included the imminent molting periodduring which time bycatch mortality increases, and a lower than expectedcatch per unit effort. Further, a complete closure of the red king crabfishery is possible due to the current severe low abundance of this speciesalthough this decision will not be made by the ADFandamp;G until after the1989 crab survey is complete. Hence, NOAA does not perceive an unfair bycatchregulatory burden being imposed on trawlers. Moreover, the focus on thisrule is control of the bycatch effects of one fishery on others, i.e.,the effect of the groundfish trawl fishery on crab and halibut fisheries.Bycatches of crabs in the crab fishery and of groundfish in the groundfishfishery also may be problems on which the Council may make regulatory recommendationsto the Secretary in the future.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> The boundaries of the closed area are inappropriatelyspecified, the northern boundary being too far north and the eastern boundarybeing too far east. Seasonal expansion of the closed area is unjustifiedand was established by the Council without opportunity for public comment.Midwater trawling should be exempt from the area closed to all trawl gearsince midwater trawl gear accounts for little bycatch of crabs and halibut.For halibut conservation purposes there is no need for a year-round areaclosure.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA acknowledges that crabs and halibut in the areaclosed to fishing with trawl gear under andSection; 675.22 probably movein and out of the area. Exactly how many crabs and halibut are protectedat any one time from encountering trawl gear within this area is unknown.Based on the 1988 crab survey, the area south of 58anddegrees;00andmin16; N.latitude and between 160anddegrees;00andmin16; and 162anddegrees;00andmin16; W.longitude contained about 22 percent of the red king crab population. Ofthis amount, an estimated 37 percent were mature males (110-199mm) and38 percent were mature females (90-199mm). Surveys in earlier years showedlarger proportions of the red king crab population within the closed areaindicating that crab distribution will vary between years. The 1989 crabsurvey may indicate an increase or decrease in the proportions of the totalred king crab population encompassed by the closed area boundaries. However,NOAA finds that current data indicate that a significant portion of thepopulation of this crab species is protected by the closed area.The seasonal expansion of the closed area to 163anddegrees;00andmin16; W. longitudewill bring an additional 52.3 percent of the total red king crab populationunder protection during the critical molting and mating period when theirshells are soft and more vulnerable to damage from trawl gear. Shiftingthe northern boundary of this area one half degree latitude south and theeastern boundary one degree longitude west would remove about 15 percentof the total red king crab population from the protection of the closedarea. While this is not a large portion of the total population, it wouldconstitute a significant dilution of the protective effect of the closedarea for red king crabs.The Council decided to expand the closed area, after receiving public testimony,on the basis of scientific response to questions developed during Councildiscussion. NOAA does not find that such a discovery process obviates publiccomment during the rulemaking process and further that the public has beenafforded additional comment opportunity during the public review of theproposed rule.As its name implies, midwater or off-bottom trawl gear usually does notoperate in contact with the sea bottom where crabs live. Therefore, suchtrawl gear often has substantially lower bycatch rates than bottom trawlgear. This appears especially true when midwater gear is used during thefirst four months of the year to harvest pollock in spawning aggregations.However, midwater trawl gear can be rigged at other times to catch fishvery close to the sea bottom, for example, pollock in more dispersed feedingschools during the summer. The bycatch rates of midwater gear operatedclose to the bottom may be significantly higher than when the gear is operatedhigher in the water column. As such, there is no way for NOAA to verifywhether any particular midwater trawl is being operated at a depth whichwill minimize its bycatch. NOAA, therefore, has no reason to change theconstraint on using midwater trawl gear in the closed area.NOAA agrees that halibut are widely distributed on the Bering Sea continentalshelf and that the closed area by itself offers little overall bycatchprotection to halibut. However, the closed area includes an area northof the Alaska Peninsula in which juvenile halibut are particularly abundant.Any relocation of the trawl fleet to other areas that contain older fishwould serve to decrease the effect of trawl bycatches on recruitment tothe halibut fishery. Any benefits of the closed area in this regard arehighly uncertain, however. The principal purpose of the closed area isthe protection of red king crabs and, to a lesser extent, <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crabs and halibut.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>The 1989 JVP fishery has left the DAP fishery withtoo little king crab PSC limit relative to its uncaught groundfish quota.<T3>Response: </T3>The JVP fisheries in 1989 to date have operated fromJanuary 1 through March 12. Preliminary observer data from these fisheriesindicate that a total 175,657 red king and 153,371 <T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crabs were taken in Zone 1. An additional 82,729<T3>C. bairdi </T3>Tanner crabs were taken in Zone 2 and 560 mt of halibutwere taken in the BSAI area. Any of these bycatch amounts that meet orexceed the specified PSC allowances for the two JVP fisheries will triggerappropriate area closures; however, the rule does not provide for deductingbycatches in excess of a PSC allowance from other PSC allowances. Hence,DAP fisheries will be unaffected by excessive bycatches in, for example,the JVP flatfish fishery, because DAP estimated red king crab bycatch wouldbe counted retroactively against the PSC apportionment of the DAP flatfishfishery. This provision implements the intent of the Council not to sanctionall fisheries with an area closure due to the excessive bycatches of asingle fishery.Ordinarily, bycatches of the four fisheries would not exceed their respectivePSC allowances because their attainment would trigger area closures. Sincethe sum of the PSC allowances equals the PSC limit for a species, promptclosures would ensure that PSC limits also will not be exceeded. Due tothe effective date of this rule late in the 1989 fishing year, however,some PSC allowances may be exceeded. The amounts by which PSC allowancesare exceeded in 1989, if at all, are not expected to be significantly damagingto the biological welfare of crabs and halibut or the economic welfareof crab and halibut fisheries. <T3>Comment 5: </T3>Without requiring observers on DAP fishing vessels,estimates of bycatch in the DAP fisheries will be faulty due to:(a) Reliance on voluntary submission of catch data,(b) Estimates of DAP bycatch based on extrapolation from JVP bycatch datafrom earlier years when JVP fishing behavior was modified by incentivesnot applicable to DAP, and (c) Large error inherent in estimator calculations. How does such voluntarycompliance and extrapolation of bycatch rates to DAP fisheries preventoverfishing and comply with National Standard 2? The system of accountingfor DAP bycatches will confer an excessive privilege on DAP fishermen comparedwith JVP fishermen. Amendment 12A should be changed to include a comprehensiveobserver requirement and incentives to reduce bycatches at the companyor individual vessel levels.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA agrees that full observer coverage on all fishingvessels sorting trawl-caught groundfish, as is currently the case in JVPfisheries, provides the most accurate estimate of prohibited species bycatch.Such observer coverage on DAP fishing vessels currently is not available.NOAA believes, however, that realistic estimates of DAP bycatches can bederived from a variety of other data sources. One of these sources is theDAP catch data reports. These reports are required under andSection; 675.5and are not voluntary. Catches and receipts of groundfish by catcher/processorand mothership/processor vessels are submitted weekly by the vessel operatorand are corroborated by unannounced inspections at sea and by State ofAlaska fish tickets which are required of all vessels fishing off Alaska.All catcher/processor and mothership/processor vessels also must checkin and out of each statistical area in which they operate. NOAA scientistswill estimate unobserved DAP bycatches based on the species compositionof harvested groundfish, the time and location of harvests, comparisonwith known bycatch rates from previous similar fisheries, and any otherrelevant data. This may involve extrapolation from JVP bycatch data fromearlier years. NOAA acknowledges the statistical limitations and implicationsof this approach. It will be consistent with National Standard 2, however,if it is based on the best available scientific information.Any estimation of the amount of crabs and halibut taken as bycatch willbe subject to error. Bycatch estimates of unobserved catches probably willhave a greater error than observed catches. The NMFS, therefore, will makeconservative assumptions in determining whether a DAP fishery has attainedits PSC apportionment. In addition, the NMFS intends to make ample useof the marine resource observers authorized under the Marine Mammal ProtectionAct to substantiate estimates of DAP bycatch rates as the DAP fisheriesare being conducted. Hence, the system used to estimate unobserved DAPbycatches is not likely to permit DAP fisheries to have significantly largerbycatches than their PSC allowances. NOAA agrees, however, that this system,although adequate in this situation, is not perfect and does not providesufficient incentive for individual vessel operators to reduce their bycatchof prohibited species. NOAA will encourage the Council to this end as itprepares future bycatch management recommendations to succeed Amendment12a.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> At sea enforcement will be difficult and sometimesimpossible. All DAP vessels should be required to maintain daily catchlogs, offload all product when any one area is closed to one DAP fisheryand not the other, or the fisheries should be defined on a tow-by-tow andretained-on-board basis.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA acknowledges that the assignment of prohibitedspecies bycatches to one of the four defined fisheries based on weeklycatch reports cannot be verified at sea. Closure of one DAP (or JVP) fisheryand not the other will be enforced through the use of the directed fishingdefinition (andSection; 675.2). For example, when the ``DAP flatfish fishery''attains its PSC allowance of red king crab in Zone 1, then the Secretarywould prohibit DAP directed fishing for yellowfin sole, rock sole, and``other flatfish'' for the remainder of the fishing year in Zone 1. Accordingto the directed fishing definition, such a prohibition would mean thatany DAP fishing vessel in Zone 1 would be in violation if it were foundto have retained yellowfin sole, rock sole, and ``other flatfish,'' inthe aggregate, amounting to 20 percent or more of the total amount of fishand fish products on board, as calculated in round-weight equivalents.NOAA agrees also that the maintenance of daily catch logs would documentwhen and where catches of groundfish were made by a DAP fishing vessel.Although the Council has recommended requiring daily catch and productionlogs to be implemented for the 1990 fishing year, they currently are notrequired.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Closure of Zones 1 and 2H to a fishery on attainmentof its primary halibut PSC allowance will be of minimal value in controllingthe effects of halibut bycatch. Bycatch management for halibut should emphasizeactual removals on a BSAI-wide basis. The PSC limit for halibut is toohigh. It would be increased from 1,325 mt under Amendment 10 to 5,333 mtunder Amendment 12a at a time when the exploitable biomass of halibut appearsto be declining at about 5 percent per year. The Alaska-wide halibut bycatchmortality should not exceed 6,000 mt since this is the 10-year averageunder which the halibut resource has rebuilt itself from previous declines.The halibut PSC allowances for the DAP fisheries should be monitored byusing a predictive model in the absence of on-board observers. Bycatchcontrols should incorporate incentives for individual fishermen to reducebycatch rates.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA is aware of recent scientific work suggesting thatspecies composition of the groundfish catch has the single most importantinfluence on halibut bycatch rates. This work appears to discount previousinformation showing the distribution of juvenile halibut. The recommendationto close Zones 1 and 2H at some primary level of bycatch was based in parton this distribution information. Although the biological value to halibutof closing these zones to groundfish fishing at certain times remains tobe seen, such closures may have value also in the protection of other prohibitedspecies and in providing incentive for groundfish fishermen to avoid bycatchesof halibut. NOAA agrees that this approach does not provide ideal incentivesto the individual vessel operator, and will consider such an approach inthe future.The principal reason why the halibut PSC limit is higher than it was underAmendment 10 (implemented in 1987 and 1988 at 52 FR 8592, March 19, 1987)is that the bycatch of more groundfish fisheries is being counted againstthe PSC limit than was done under Amendment 10. NOAA finds the goal ofan Alaska-wide halibut bycatch of 6,000 mt reasonable, but notes that anysignificant increase in bycatch is likely to be reflected in a reductionof catch limits for halibut fishermen in future years. Although this maynot be a desirable effect, it is in the judgment of the Council and theSecretary, a reasonable balance between excessive bycatch and prohibitivebycatch control. At lower levels of halibut biomass, this balance may morereasonably be struck at a PSC limit less than 6,000 mt Alaska-wide or 5,333mt for the BSAI area.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>What amount of bycatch of crabs would be consideredstatistically and biologically significant? The PSC limits for crab speciesshould be established at 1 percent or 2 percent of the total crab population.<T3>Response: </T3>A key feature of the controversy over the establishmentof crab PSC limits was the biological significance of crab bycatch mortalityto the overall crab population. The Council's Scientific and StatisticalCommittee advised that, with current crab survey methods, a removal of1 percent of the total population of a crab species would not be detected.Trawl fishing interests who had proposed 1 percent of the population asa PSC limit interpreted this advice as confirmation of a biologically acceptablebycatch amount.In 1988, the total red king crab population was estimated to be about 40million animals. The precision of this estimate, however, is such thatthe true abundance of red king crabs in 1988 had a 95 percent probabilityof being within the range of 21 million to 59 million animals. With thiskind of precision, the removal of the 1 percent PSC limit of 400,000 animalsprobably would not be statistically significant. However, at very low populationlevels, say the lower end of the probable abundance range, 400,000 animalsmay be biologically meaningful to the regenerative potential of the stock.Clearly, there is no simple biologically or scientifically ``correct''PSC limit. Instead, the best PSC limit is the one that strikes the bestbalance between excessive bycatch and prohibitive regulation. These areadmittedly qualitative terms that suggest some optimum among competingobjectives. NOAA suggests that this optimum is practically impossible todiscover or prove scientifically.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>There should be provision for reapportionment of PSCallowances among fisheries concurrent with the reapportionment of TAC betweenJVP and DAP.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA agrees. Such authority was contemplated in theproposed rule at andSection; 675.20(e)(4) and discussed in the preamble tothe proposed rule (page 19201, center column at 54 FR 19199, May 4, 1989).To clarify this intent, however, the language of andSection; 675.20(e)(4)has been slightly revised in the final rule.<T3>Comment 10:</T3> Amendment 12A complies with the National Standardsof the Magnuson Act and should be approved. Domestic trawling is supposedto be closely monitored in the winter halibut saving area according tothe FMP. Since the bycatch of halibut tends to be of juvenile animals,the impact on the commercial halibut fishery will be delayed two to fouryears. Halibut bycatch was reduced by foreign fleets even with an increasinghalibut population. Therefore, Amendment 12a is not overly restrictiveand should be implemented.<T3>Response: </T3>Comment noted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Regional Director has determined the FMP Amendment 12a is necessaryfor the conservation and management of the BSAI area groundfish fisheriesand that this amendment is consistent with the provisions of the MagnusonAct, and other applicable law.The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for these amendments.The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries concluded that there will beno significant impact on the environment as a result of this rule. A copyof the EA may be obtained from the Council at the address above.The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere of NOAA (UnderSecretary) determined that this rule is not a ``major rule'' requiringa regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291. This determinationis based on the EA/RIR/FRFA prepared by the Council which concluded thatpast industry performance and public testimony indicate that the trawlfisheries will be able to reduce their bycatch rates of halibut and craband avoid early closures. Although some scenarios discussed in the RIR,projected profit losses to the trawl fisheries in excess of $100 million,NOAA believes that the groundfish trawl fishing fleet will respond to thepotential for lost revenues by modifying fishing patterns to reduce bycatchrates, thereby mitigating any negative impacts on their profits. A copyof the EA/RIR/IRFA may be obtained from the Council at the address above.The Under Secretary concludes that this rule would have significant effectson small entities. These effects have been discussed in the EA/RIR/IRFA,a copy of which may be obtained from the Council at the address above.The Under Secretary determined that this rule does not contain a collectionof information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management program of Alaska. This determination was submitted forreview by the responsible State agencies under section 307 of the CoastalZone Management Act. The State agencies failed to comment within the statutorytime period.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>50 CFR Part 611Fisheries, Foreign fishing.50 CFR Part 675Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
