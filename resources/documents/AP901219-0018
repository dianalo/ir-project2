He spent yearsprosecuting Ku Klux Klansmen and other perpetrators of violentracial hate crimes.   But this time the peril was political, and Assistant EducationSecretary Michael L. Williams acknowledged Tuesday that he was notprepared for it.   The 37-year-old lawyer said last week that universitiesreceiving federal money could not legally reserve scholarships forminorities - and promptly created turmoil in the White House, thecivil rights community and the ranks of higher education.   ``Politically naive,'' Williams called himself, although he hadserved in 1988 as a domestic policy adviser to the Bush campaignbefore his appointment to head the Education Department's civilrights office.   Others had less charitable descriptions. ``An outrage,'' saidRalph Neas, executive director of the 200-member LeadershipConference on Civil Rights. ``We don't find this helpful at all,''said David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council onEducation, an umbrella group of colleges and universities.   At the center of the storm is a black Texan with a blue-ribbonresume, solid conservative credentials and an equally solid recordof fighting racial injustices.   Williams is a Midland, Texas, native and childhood friend ofPresident Bush's son George. His parents and his wife, a pilot andmechanical engineer, all attended historically black colleges.   He received three degrees from the University of California - aB.A., a master's in public administration and a law degree. Andwhile he was there he challenged the school to admit more blacks byweighing socio-economic factors as well as test scores.   Williams' resume also lists community involvement: he was a BigBrother in Midland, and now he tutors elementary schoolchildren inreading.   Then there is his career at the Justice Department, where heserved from 1984 to 1988 as a senior trial attorney in the civilrights division headed by William Bradford Reynolds.   He tried and won cases against North Carolina Klansmen whoconspired to obtain stolen military weapons; an Idaho whitesupremacist who tried to drive black and interracial families fromtheir homes; a Kentucky Klansman who fire-bombed the home of ablack family; and law enforcement officers in Alabama, Arizona,North Carolina and Oklahoma who assaulted private citizens.   ``He went after them with a vengeance and was very successful,''said Reynolds. ``He was a very savvy lawyer, a thoughtful,level-headed kind of guy who learned very quickly and didexceptionally well.''   Not on his resume, but mentioned often by friends andassociates, is Williams' sense of humor - reportedly as acute asEddie Murphy's. Another trademark is an ever-present pair of lizardcowboy boots. He also collects plates - one from every state inwhich he's tried a case.   Awash in ambivalence last week over Williams' blanket ruling,Bush nevertheless defended the official as ``extraordinarilysensitive, very intelligent.'' Even his political opponents arecharitable.   ``I will not question Mr. Williams' integrity or hiscredentials,'' said Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., who summonedWilliams to a hearing of his House Education and Labor Committee toexplore the scholarship issue.   Hawkins, echoing the views of many, said he believes Williams``just merely issued an opinion which is based on what he perceivedto be the administration's position.''   That turned out not to be the case, at least at the highestlevels of the administration, and Williams announced Tuesday thatcolleges could keep offering minority-only scholarships if theyused private money earmarked solely for that purpose.   A senior White House official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Williams was not ordered to change his mind.   ``We had a conversation in which we were exploring what couldand couldn't be done under the regulations. And Michael was verycooperative, very interested in finding what his full flexibilitieswere,'' the official said. ``I think he deserves credit for beingable to come up with a solution.''   Williams himself rejected any suggestion that he had beenmanipulated by the administration, either in his initial ruling orin softening it.   ``I haven't been a lackey for anyone,'' he declaed. ``Theposition I took was a position I took because I thought it wasright.''   Whether the current brouhaha will lead to stardom or oblivion isanyone's guess. ``In this town,'' said Reynolds, ``I would not darepredict.''</TEXT></DOC>
