A study of the Medical College of Ohio applicators indicatesthat the radiation contamination outside the field can be as high as18% of the central axis dose. The effects of the photon collimator settingon the magnitude and energy of the radiation contamination are discussedand means are presented for reducing this unwanted radiation. The dosenonuniformity across the field is found to be virtually independent ofthe photon collimator setting and is shown to be mostly due to the transparentapplicator wall. The clinical significance of the findings is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
