The sale, mostly to institutional investors, byVendamerica B.V. puts almost nine million Dillard Class Acommon shares in public hands, which analysts said shouldimprove the trading volume of the stock. But the move won'tmake Dillard vulnerable to a takeover. The Dillard family,led by Chief Executive Officer William T. Dillard, ownsnearly 99% of the Class B stock, and Class B holders electtwo-thirds of the company's board.</LP><TEXT>   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Dillard's stock rose $7 to $108.   Vendamerica's parent company, Vendex International N.V.,couldn't be reached to comment.   The retailer, based in Amsterdam, has been struggling toreduce its debt load and staunch losses at several majorunits, including its Vroom andamp; Dreesmann department stores inthe Netherlands and a small U.S. chain of home-improvementstores, Mr. Goodbuys.   A plan to sell a troubled Dutch banking unit, StaalBankiers, fell through last year, and Vendex recentlyannounced an almost-complete pullout from Brazil after heavylosses on retailing operations there.   The sale should help the Dutch company's results. Afterbuying more than 30% of Little Rock, Ark.-based Dillard in1978 for $24 million, Vendamerica made additional purchases,including one million shares bought in 1986 for less than $45each. At one point, Vendamerica owned 41.5% of Dillard. Butthe Dutch retailer sold two million shares in the summer of1989, and three million shares last summer.   For the year ended Jan. 31, Vendex reported net profit of90 million guilders ($48 million), down from 96 millionguilders a year earlier, but the company would have shown asizable loss without extraordinary income from sellingDillard shares last year. Vendex sales edged down to 15.3billion guilders.   A fast-growing department-store chain, Dillard's netincome rose 23% to $182.8 million, or $5.01 a share, in theyear ended Jan. 31. Sales rose 18% to $3.61 billion.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. led the underwriting group.</TEXT></DOC>
