(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A college lecturer was cleared ofcharges he made a bomb threat on an American Airlines flight afteran 11-year-old boy admitted he wrote the note and left it on theaircraft, says an apologetic FBI.   Charges against Peter W. Canning, a lecturer in literature at theUniversity of California-Berkeley, were dropped Thursday after theboy told the FBI he wrote the note.   Canning, 40, found the note on an American Airlines jetlinerTuesday, gave it to a flight attendant and was arrested by the FBI.   The FBI's top New Mexico agent, Jim Nelson, said he ``regrets anyinconvenience and embarassment suffered by Mr. Canning.''   ``However, the investigation fully warranted the arrest ofCanning, which occurred after consulting with the U.S. attorney'soffice in Albuquerque,'' Nelson said.   Canning, a Harvard doctoral candidate, could not be reached forcomment because he was driving home to Berkeley when the chargeswere dropped by U.S. Magistrate Sumner G. Buell in Albuquerque. Hehad been released on his own recognizance the previous day.   Canning had insisted all along that the note fell into his lapfrom his seat tray while lunch was being served on the flight fromSan Francisco to Dallas. He handed the note to a flight attendant,who notified the pilot.   The plane was diverted to Albuquerque and was searched for aboutfour hours with bomb-sniffing dogs.   The boy came forward with his parents Thursday, and admittedwriting the note during a flight to San Francisco earlier Tuesday,said FBI spokesman Douglas Beldon. The note was put on the pullouttray before it was stowed away, he said.   The note said: ``Read this. There are guns pointed at you. If youwant to live, read the letter underneath and do what it says. Thisis a bomb scare. Read this. PS If you do what the letter says, andhave everyone else do it, you will live. PS If you don't, you arehistory!! There are bombs planted all over this airplane and thereis a gun pointed at your head. Take your wallet and throw it in theaisle now.''   At the time of the arrest, federal agents said there weresimilarities between Canning's handwriting and the note.   Agents determined that the boy sat in the seat later occupied byCanning, Beldon said. He said the U.S. attorney's office in SanFrancisco declined to prosecute the boy.   Canning's attorney, Ray Twohig, had said the arrest resulted fromFBI confusion. ``I'm glad they've cleared up their confusion,'' hesaid Thursday.   Asked if the crash of a Pan Am jumbo jet in Scotland last weekmight have affected the way this case was handled, Twohig said:``Sure, everybody was jumpy.   ``I just hope that people who read about this and hear about thisaren't discouraged from reporting things,'' Twohig said. Canning hassaid he almost withheld the note.</TEXT></DOC>
