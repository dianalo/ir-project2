VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Backers of the Equal Rights Amendment made itthe first order of business for the new Congress but say the realbattleground for its adoption is in the state legislatures where itdied in 1982.   ``Our foremothers never gave up on the right to vote until wewon, and we will never give up on the Equal Rights Amendment untilwe have won,'' Molly Yard, president of the National Organizationfor Women, told a Capitol Hill news conference.   ``We are certainly not giving up,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,D-Calif., who was joined by 128 other House members in co-sponsoringthe ERA as House Joint Resolution 1 before the new Congress as itconvened on Tuesday.   Yard said the campaign for passage would concentrate on statelegislatures, where she said women would need to control one-thirdof the seats, about twice the share they now hold, to ensure themeasure's ratification.   ``It's shocking to me that on the 200th anniversary of theConstitution, women are still not in it,'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder,D-Colo., said.   The nation celebrated the bicentennial of the signing andratification of the Constitution in 1987 and 1988.   The Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit sexdiscrimination, came closest to passage nearly seven years ago,having been approved by Congress and 35 state legislatures. Theproposed amendment still needed approval by three more statelegislatures when time for its ratification expired on June 30, 1982.   It was re-introduced in Congress in 1983, 1985 and 1987 but didnot win the two-thirds support needed to be submitted to the statesagain. The Republican Party has withdrawn its support for theproposed amendment. And President-elect Bush, who once supported theERA, also has changed his mind.   But Yard said she remained hopeful that such a proposal would beadopted before the end of the century.   Edwards said he was encouraged by the number of co-sponsors ofthe proposal, but said he did not know whether it would make itthrough Congress this time.</TEXT></DOC>
