Two of the failed banks -- First Bank of Saginaw, Saginaw, Texas, and First Commercial Bank of Texas, Houston -- are to reopen today as branches of other institutions. The FDIC decided to pay the insured deposits of the other bank, First State Bank of Forest City, Forest City, Mo., after the agency received no acceptable bids for its purchase.    First Bank's office, closed yesterday by state authorities, is to reopen as a branch of Southwest Bank, Fort Worth. The failed bank had assets totaling $30.7 million and held $30 million in 6,400 deposit accounts.    The sole office of First Commercial, closed yesterday by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen as a branch of Omnibanc North Belt, also of Houston. First Commercial had assets of $4.6 million and held deposits of $4.7 million.    These two failures bring to 20 the number of Texas banks to close this year.    Tomorrow, the FDIC is to begin paying off the insured deposits of First State, which was closed yesterday by state authorities. The failed bank had assets of $6.2 million and held deposits of $6.5 million in 1,500 accounts, all within the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    First State was the third bank to fail this year in Missouri. </TEXT></DOC>
