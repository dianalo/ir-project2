State Superintendent William Honig is sponsor of a bill,written by state Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles, that wouldprohibit electronic media advertising in schools. A similarbill made it through the state senate only to be defeated ina legislative committee last year.</LP><TEXT>   The bill would nullify contracts between companies andlocal school districts that require students to sit throughcommercials, like those on Channel One, a production ofWhittle Communications L.P. of Knoxville, Tenn.   Laura Eshbaugh, vice chairman of Whittle, said Mr. Honig'smove is an attempt to wrest control from local schooldistricts. &quot;It would be unfortunate if schools in Californiawere deprived of a resource so widely used in the rest of thecountry,&quot; she said, adding that 7,085 schools in 46 statesnow subscribe to Channel One.   But Mr. Honig believes it is improper for schools to giveup decisions about class content to an outside agency --&quot;especially one in the advertising business,&quot; said Mr.Honig's aide, William Rukeyser. &quot;We're unable to determinethe educational content of a commercial for Mandamp;M's.   &quot;Selling access to kids is one authority the schools havenever been delegated,&quot; he said, adding that students aren't&quot;a saleable commodity.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
