Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who, with Sen. Bill Roth, R-Del.,wrote the bill, told reporters he expects it to become law thisyear.   A solid majority of the House already has voted for acapital-gains tax cut _ as part of deficit-reduction legislation _that carried the endorsement of President Bush. But that proposaldid not affect IRAs and the Senate version of the legislation doesnot include the capital-gains provision.   ``This plan provides opportunities and incentives for allAmericans,'' Roth said. ``It's good for both savers and investors.And it's good for America.''   Allowing one of the saving incentives without the other ``wouldbe like a henhouse without a rooster,'' Roth said. ``You may stillget the eggs but you're not going to keep the hens happy.''   Packwood said he can count 55 to 58 votes for the measure. ``Theadministration supports this bill, although it would support somealternatives'' as well, he said.   Negotiators from the House and Senate met for the first time totry to write a compromise deficit-reduction bill, but as expectedgot nowhere.   The key gulf between the two chambers is over whether to removea capital gains tax cut and other provisions from the legislation,and what would happen to them if they were removed.   Those decisions ultimately will be made by House and Senateleaders but negotiators met to state their positions.   Senators insisted that the money-saving legislation be kept freeof controversial items, with Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., saying,``We're not going to put them on this bill.''   But Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., and other House membersexpressed a reluctance to strip capital gains and other items fromthe budget-cutting bill and assume ``everything else will fall intoplace.''   The Roth-Packwood bill would:   _Exclude from taxation up to 35 percent of individual capitalgains, which are profits from the sale of stock and otherinvestments. The longer an asset were held, the less it would betaxed. Five percent of the gain from the sale of assets owned morethan one year would be excluded; if the asset were held more thanseven years, 35 percent of the gain would be excluded.   As an option, an investor could exclude from taxation any gaincaused solely by inflation.   Present law fully taxes capital gains, just as it does wages andsalaries.   _Cut the tax rate on corporate capital gains, now 34 percent, toas low as 29 percent.   _Permit individuals to set aside up to $2,000 a year in an IRA,increasing to $3,000 a year after five years. There would be no taxdeduction on the contribution; instead, the contribution andinterest it earned could be withdrawn tax-free for retirement,paying for a college education, medical expenses or buying a firsthome.   The plan would permit workers who in the past have madetax-deductible contributions to an IRA to ``roll over'' thoseaccounts into one of the new types in order to become eligible fortax-free withdrawals for education, medical expenses or homebuying.   However, that rollover would require the worker to pay tax overthe following four years on the original tax-free contributions.For example, a worker who contributed to an IRA in 1985 and 1986could transfer that money into one of the new accounts in 1991 andpay taxes on the transfer in 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994.   The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates thatbecause of the rollover provision, the plan would raise federalrevenues by $1.3 billion over the next five years.   Workers who are allowed under present law to make tax-deductibleIRA contributions would not lose that opportunity. This includesany worker not covered by a company pension, any covered couplewith income under $50,000 and a covered single person with incomeunder $35,000.   If the Roth-Packwood proposal is to become law, it would have tobe attached to some House-passed revenue bill. A prime candidate isa debt-limit measure that must be passed this year to raise thegovernment's borrowing authority.   The House-passed capital-gains amendment is part of a hugedeficit-reduction bill on which House and Senate negotiators beganworking Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
