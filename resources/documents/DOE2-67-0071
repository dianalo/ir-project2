Approximately 300 traffic signals, most of which aremaintained and operated by the Oakland County Road Commission, are locatedwithin this consortium area. Most of these signals operate under isolated,electro-mechanical, pretimed control. Only a small percentage of thesesignals is interconnected to provide for the progressive movement oftraffic. The apparent low costs of using these available facilities,coupled with the potential demonstrated by the limited successes achievedin other parts of the country in using shared cable as a medium for trafficsignal interconnect, has inspired the consortium to investigate the possibilityof using a portion of the channel bandwidth to accomplish this criticalfunction. The cable company concurred with this investigation and agreedto fund the engineering portion of a pilot demonstration project. Thispaper reports on the progress and findings of the project to date.</TEXT></DOC>
