It will not result in (1) an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase incosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, orlocal government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) have significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. During calendar year 1985, FSIS conducted reinspection on over 2.4 billionpounds of imported products. Reinspection of imported products, which isdirected by the Agency's Automated Import Information System (AIIS), checksthe effectiveness of foreign inspection systems in assuring that only wholesome,not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled and packaged product entersthe United States, and assuring that such products meet the same inspection,sanitary, quality, species verification, and residue standards that areapplied to domestic producers and their products. Information retrieved from the AIIS for the period January 1, 1985, throughDecember 31, 1985, shows that over 2.4 billion pounds of product were offeredfor reinspection. Of that amount, 25.9 percent (641,331,144 pounds) wasproduct coming from Canada, almost always via land, and no more than theremaining 74.1 percent (1,837,312,092) pounds) was product arriving viawater. For calendar year 1986, these figures remain fairly constant withapproximately 25.7 percent of product arriving from Canada and no morethan 74.3 percent arriving over water. An analysis of data maintained by the Bureau of the Census, which indicatesin which Customs Service (Customs) districts product is unloaded and inwhich districts it is presented for reinspection, provides representativeinformation concerning amounts of product that could be affected by thischange. The data maintained by the Census Bureau is supplied by Customswhich, in turn, receives the information from importers. For the period May 1, 1985, to April 30, 1986, the total amount unloadedand presented for reinspection within districts of unloading <T3>1,500,434,894 </T3>pounds (<T3>80.5 </T3>percent of all waterborne meat and poultry imports). Thisamount of product is traveling only a short distance or not at all andwould not be affected by the proposed change. The total amount of productmoved after unloading in one district and presented for reinspection inanother district was <T3>361,473,786 </T3>pounds (<T3>19.5 </T3>percent of all waterborne meat and pountry imports and 7percent of total imports). This is the amount of product that, in 1985,could have been subject to the change proposed herein.This proposal will have no affect on the volume of imported product. Theproposal is expected to affect only the point at which product is reinspected.Therefore, there will be no overall loss of business associated with thereinspection of imported meat and poultry products. The business redistributionthat could be generated by the proposed rule would be restricted to anaffect on the 7 percent of total imports that are now presented for reinspectionin a district other than the one in which they are unloaded. It is unlikelythat even this affect will occur, since adjustments can be made in thewaterborne destination, in which case there would be no change in the locationof reinspection. Other adjustments to minimize this impact can be madeby the importing industry (see the next section). In any case, there willbe no overall loss of business as a result of this proposed rule, and significantbenefits will accrue to the effectiveness and efficiency of import inspection.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect on Small Entities</ITAG>The Administrator, FSIS, has made an initial determination that this proposedrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The determination is based on several factors.FSIS has undertaken an informal survey of the affected industry to determinethe impact of the proposed rule. Information gathered shows that reinspectionof waterborne product takes place in facilities that provide general storageand distribution services for various products. Storage, distribution andreinspection of meat and poultry products represent less than 30 percentof any firm's activities in the majority of cases, and in many cases lessthan 10 percent. FSIS found that the 30 percent or less of the firm's activityinvolving meat and poultry products is impacted by several factors. Thesefactors include proximity of the firm's establishment to the end user,port of call patterns of shipping carriers, varying port charges and facilities,cost and availability of transport for redistribution, cost and availabilityof labor, firm maintenance costs, insurance, etc. Experience indicatesthat all of these factors are operating to some degree at all times andare more significant in their economic impacts on firms than the availabilityof FSIS personnel.Following announcement in January 1987 of FSIS's plans to implement therecommendations of the OIG import audit, the Administrator of FSIS discussedthe change outlined in this proposed rule with import industry officials.He explained the change and requested information concerning impacts ofthe change. Industry officials have not provided any data.Some industry officials have taken various actions to comply with the proposaland thus minimize its effects. For example, a new facility has just beencompleted in California to handle the product that was transported overlandto other ports for reinspection; another port is making considerable effortsto have ships unload product for reinspection at its docks; and severalcompanies have diversified their activities to include a greater proportionof non-meat and poultry products. FSIS is also aware that practices, suchas delaying payment of various fees, including certain handling costs inoverall charges, and modernizing storage and handling facilities, are partof the industry strategy to minimize any impact of this proposed rule and,more generally, to increase business.As noted above, although the Agency knows that the proposed rule couldaffect the distribution of the business associated with no more than 7percent of total meat and poultry import reinspection, it cannot predicthow much of this 7 percent will be redistributed. Not only can adjustmentsbe made by shippers, but the import industry itself has open to it manyoptions that would minimize the impact of the proposed rule. Further, theAgency has no reason to believe that this proposal would have a disproportionateeffect on smaller firms.This information supports the Agency determination that the proposed rulewould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning thisproposal. Written comments should be sent in duplicate to the Policy Office.Please include the docket number that appears in the heading of this document.Any person desiring an opportunity for oral presentation of views shouldmake such request to Ms. Stolfa so that arrangements can be made for suchviews to be presented. A transcript will be made of all views orally presented.All comments submitted in response to the proposal will be available forpublic inspection in the Policy Office between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.,Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Currently, andSection;andSection; 327.7 and 381.200 of the Federal meat andpoultry products inspection regulations permit imported product to be unloadedat the port of first arrival or, ``if arriving by water, from the wharfwhere unloaded,'' and then transported, under official seal, to anotherlocation where import inspection is to be conducted (9 CFR 327.7 and 381.200).These regulations also provide specific, extensive sealing requirementsfor any transportation of imported product. Before product that has notbeen reinspected can be transported, the means of conveyance (car, truck,railcar) must be sealed with an official import seal. The seal must beaffixed by either a Program or Customs employee. Sections 327.7 and 381.200also allow, in lieu of sealing, for colored placards containing a warningnotice to be affixed to the product containers by the importer. Labelingproduct containers or sealing the means of conveyance assures that theidentity of the product is maintained until it arrives at its final destinationand is presented for reinspection.There is no practical way FSIS can ensure that such product once introducedto the United States will be presented to USDA for reinspection or ensurecompliance with the sealing provisions. Given the volume of imported product(2.1 billion pounds per year) and FSIS's limited resources (90 import inspectors),it is physcially impossible for FSIS personnel to seal each conveyancein which imported products might be transported or to break the seals,if affixed, once product arrives at its intended destination. Customs'regulations permit movement in-bond without further sealing (provided foreigncountry seals have been affixed), and Customs does not have the resourcesto provide special handling services regarding imported meat and poultryproducts. FSIS cannot in fact control the transportation under seal ofsuch product prior to reinspection.FSIS regulations which permit the movement of product after unloading priorto reinspection were intended only to parallel Customs' regulations (19CFR 18.11), which permit the movement under bond of most imported goodsfrom the port of first arrival before documents are filed and the dutyis assessed. If requested by the importer, meat and poultry products maybe transported in Customs' bonded carriers, from the port of unloading(the port where the product is first off-loaded from a vessel, truck orother conveyance onto United States soil) to another Customs' (port) locationfor declaration and examination by Customs' officers. However, Customsdoes not routinely monitor such transportation of imported meat and poultryproducts. In these cases, formal Customs entry for consumption or warehouse,involving the filing of forms and payment of applicable duty, if any, canbe accomplished at the ``port of destination.'' (19 CFR 18.11). Therefore,the physical arrival of product in the United States often takes placeat one location and entry for Customs' purposes at another.In April 1985, FSIS import reinspection activities became realigned underInternational Programs (IP), which is separately managed from the domesticinspection program. At the same time, in response to recommendations bythe Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) for better managementand control of imported product, IP limited reinspection of imports todesignated import inspection facilities located at various ports. <ITAG tagnum="84">Restricting the Movement of Imported Product </ITAG>FSIS is proposing to limit the transportation of imported product priorto reinspection by allowing imported product to be transported only toauthorized places of inspection within the port of first arrival. Thisproposal is supported by OIG's final audit report entitled ``Imported MeatProcess'' (January 14, 1987) which recommended that FSIS ``require thatforeign meat products entering the United States be inspected by the ImportInspection Division only at the point of first arrival.'' OIG stated thatthis action will enable FSIS to maintain control over meat products enteringthe United States. The report contained a discussion noting the physicaland administrative control problems FSIS has had with products that aretransported elsewhere before being reinspected. OIG found that neitherFSIS nor Customs is able to ensure adequate physical or administrativecontrols when imported product is transported to and inspected at otherthan port-of-first-arrival locations. During the course of its audit, OIGcited instances in which product was shipped directly, without officialseals or Program or direct Customs' supervision, to intermediary transportationfacilities (stripping stations, where cargo is removed from large shippingcontainers). The product was then transferred to truck trailers or railcarsfor shipment to inland inspection sites or port facilities located severalhundred miles away, again without USDA or Customs personnel present tosupervise the transfer or to affix the official seal. As a consequence,FSIS could not be certain that all product entering the country was presentedfor reinspection. In response to the report, FSIS stated that its regulations would be revisedto require reinspection of all imported product at its initial port offirst arrival into the United States. OIG stated that this action by FSISwould be sufficient to resolve the problem and that it would close outthis recommendation once it is implemented. Recent conversations with Customs Service personnel have confirmed thatCustoms will continue to permit the product to be transported elsewhereunder bond, before it is officially presented for final Customs entry,regardless of its having been reinspected by FSIS at the port of firstarrival. Importers will still be able to postpone payment of duty untilofficial entry at a location closer to its final destination. Therefore, for the reasons discussed in the preamble, FSIS is proposingto amend Parts 325 and 327 of the Federal meat inspection regulations andPart 381 of the poultry products inspection regulations as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>9 CFR Part 325 Meat inspection, Transportation. 9 CFR Part 327 Meat inspection, Imported products. 9 CFR Part 381 Poultry products inspection, Imported products, Transportation. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 325_TRANSPORTATION </ITAG>1.
