Something terrible happened here. Deserted sidewalks, pathways to nowhere, thread past yawning cellar pits of homes that no longer exist. The town bristles with boarded-up buildings and don't-tread-on-me signs -- &quot;Keep Out,&quot; &quot;Private,&quot; &quot;No Trespassing&quot; -- and at least one don't-tread-on-me resident, who tells a visitor to &quot;get the hell out of here.&quot; The land itself, sometimes the sickly color of window putty, sometimes blown away to expose fist-sized rocks, is a Dust Bowl wound still healing over with grass.    Here is a landscape so vast that only its titanic thunderheads, boiling up in the slanting afternoon sunlight, seem in scale. Yet there is something mesmerizing about its sweep and its solitude. The Indian word Keota, by one definition, refers to a fire died out. And so it symbolizes the question overhanging this least-known, least-appreciated region of the U.S.    Is the fire dying out in the Great Plains?    The Plains, the area between the Rocky Mountains and the 98th meridian, encompasses a fifth of the contiguous 48 states -- but only 1/40th of the U.S. population. This is the American Outback. The region is so young that the lives of men like Willie Engelhardt, 73, can encompass three-fourths of the post-Indian history of a place. Sitting in the Mingo, Kan., grain elevator he owns, surrounded by postcards addressed simply &quot;Willie/Mingo, Kan.,&quot; he talks of growing up in a sod house and of Dust Bowl days so bad he was forced to eat supper beneath a dampened bedsheet. And, paradoxically, of his love for the incessant wind -- &quot;It kind of keeps you honest&quot; -- his town, and &quot;this flatness.&quot; But Mingo, a major Union Pacific shipping center in the 1890s, has melted away to little more than the grain elevator now. It is an apt symbol of a region confronting stark choices about its very future, a region losing its rural towns, using up its water, and -- in one apocalyptic prediction -- inexorably slipping back into the grassland whence it came.    Writing in Planning magazine, Frank and Deborah Popper of Rutgers University in New Jersey describe the Plains as &quot;an austere monument to American self-delusion.&quot; The delusion, embodied in the Homestead Act, was that sodbusters should plow up the semi-arid, windswept region -- land better suited to ranching than farming. The Poppers -- he is the chairman of the urban studies department, she is a geographer -- predict that over the next generation, the region will inevitably become almost totally depopulated. The wisest thing the federal government could do, they argue, is start buying back great chunks of the Plains, replant the grass, reintroduce the bison -- and turn out the lights.    There is a precedent for something like that. After the Dust Bowl, the government did buy back a New Jersey-sized empire of ravaged Plains land, establishing a network of national grasslands that includes the Pawnee National Grassland in northeastern Colorado. But the Poppers are thinking on a grander scale. They call their idea Buffalo Commons.    &quot;The Buffalo Commons will be the world's largest historic preservation project, the ultimate national park,&quot; they say. &quot;Most of the Great Plains will become what all of the United States once was.&quot;    Empty.    &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; retorts Congressman Pat Roberts, a Republican who represents the western half of Kansas. A tart-tongued and practical man who keeps the daily price of Kansas wheat chalked up on his Washington blackboard, he says such ideas amount to &quot;Walden Pond agriculture, complete with a three-legged dog named Lucky who reads the Saturday Evening Post.&quot;    Yet there is no doubt that the region, like the Rust Belt before it, is in the midst of a wrenching transition.    What is emerging, says President Philip Burgess of the Center for the New West, a Denver think tank, is an &quot;archipelago society&quot; -- urban islands along the interstate highways separated by a sea of wheat, corn and grass. The small towns that once linked them are disappearing. Michael Krier, 41, battles drought, hail and the wind on a 2,000-acre farm near Keota. But he does so by commuting some 100 miles, round trip, from his home in the comparatively big city of Greeley, Colo. He bought the farm and broke the sod four years ago. Now, amid a four-year drought, he wonders if this harsh, unforgiving land might better have been left in its natural state.    &quot;The dust blows pretty easy out here,&quot; he says.    A few other plainsmen, almost heretics in a land of high-tech agriculture and can-do optimism, are thinking similar thoughts. Former rancher Robert Scott, through an Institute of the Rockies forum, has proposed that 10% of Montana be converted into &quot;The Big Open,&quot; a privately owned Serengeti-like hunting preserve. University of Oklahoma geographer Bret Wallach suggests that the Forest Service start a long-term program of buying out marginal farmers. Even without any sweeping master plan, up to 25% of some Plains counties is going back to grass anyway under the federal Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to take marginal acreage out of production.    Meanwhile, a Kansas State University team has recommended a state policy of &quot;triage&quot; that would gradually write off many towns of fewer than 2,500 people, freeing scarce state resources for places with a better chance of survival. &quot;We don't need political rhetoric,&quot; says study member Mark Lapping, professor of regional and community planning. &quot;We're in deep trouble here.&quot;    The economic stakes are far-reaching. If the Plains were a separate nation, estimates Christopher McKinnon of the Western Governors Association, &quot;it would be the world's fourth-largest wheat producer and its sixth-largest oil producer.&quot; He roughly estimates its gross regional product at $146 billion.    Populations of many of the 400-odd High Plains counties have been in erratic decline throughout this century. Evelyn Everhart, who runs a combination filling station and sundries store in Last Chance, Colo., lives in a hamlet that has peaked and all but died in little more than six decades. The consolidated school district covers some 650 square miles. But she likes it here. &quot;A lot of people come by and say, 'What do you do?'&quot; she says with a smile. &quot;We do the same thing as anybody else.&quot;    An estimated 4,000 miles of Kansas streams and rivers, strangled by irrigation, now run only intermittently. In Hays, Kan., where the Smoky Hill River was essentially dry for a year and a half, the riverbed itself caught on fire.    But what is also under siege is a way of life. Small towns where youngsters on bikes dart like swallows at dusk. A Marlboro Man world where farmers patrol beneath a limitless sky on $50,000 tractors. Tribune, Kan., newspaperman and author Dan Epp calls the Plains a last refuge of an earlier era -- real people, still making real things -- in &quot;a nation of clerks.&quot;    Perhaps that is one reason the region suddenly finds itself the subject not only of a flurry of academic studies, but also of a flurry of literary works. Among others, author Ian Frazier has just published &quot;Great Plains,&quot; a celebration of the region, and Tony Parker is out with &quot;Bird, Kansas,&quot; a study of an actual Plains town given a fictional name. &quot;People in pith hats,&quot; grumbles Rep. Roberts, &quot;are discovering the Plains the way they used to discover New Guinea.&quot;    What they are discovering stands at least one common assumption on its head. The Plains are overwhelmingly agricultural, yet the new jobs being generated there seem to be non-agricultural. A North Dakota study by the Council of State Policy and Planning Agencies finds that nearly a fourth of North Dakotans are employed in businesses that didn't exist in 1980. And only 2% to 4% of those new businesses are agricultural.    &quot;The fundamental question is what you're going to do with all those acres,&quot; says Mark Drabenstott, a Federal Reserve economist in Kansas City, Mo. The Plains are like some auxiliary generator, kicking in additional acreage in times of high demand for its grain and beef. The questions are whether world demand will continue strong -- and how long the Plains can meet it if it does.    Today the heart of the Plains is an oasis culture nurtured by an aquifer. It is called the Ogallala, and some think it may contain almost as much recoverable water as there is in Lake Huron. Trouble is, &quot;we're pumping it out 20 times faster than it's recharging itself,&quot; says Richard Black, a Kansas State University irrigation specialist.    A decade or more ago, scattered Texas Panhandle farms began reverting to dryland farming -- farming without irrigation -- at the Ogallala's southern edge, where the water-bearing formation is thinnest. This process is expected to spread northward over a period variously estimated from decades to a century or more. What seems inevitable is a slow, semi-abandonment of marginal lands. But good land, even if eventually reduced to dryland farming, could remain in production indefinitely, experts say.    &quot;You could make an argument for continued Great Plains agriculture on national security implications alone,&quot; says John Wunder, director of the University of Nebraska's Center for Great Plains Studies. Mr. Wunder says apocalyptic proposals like Buffalo Commons remind him of &quot;ghost dancing,&quot; the strange and poignant ceremony that gripped the Plains Indians and their dying culture around 1890.    Dancing themselves into exhaustion, the Indians believed they could reverse history to pre-white days. &quot;There's a certain ghost danciness to these ideas too,&quot; says Mr. Wunder. &quot;The buffalo will come back, the land will be lush, few people will venture into it.&quot;    The consensus view -- that technology can continue to stay one jump ahead of nature -- explains the look of Plains towns. They resemble military staging areas: Plainville, Kan., with its huge piles of tires, oil pumps and great spools of cable; Burlington, Colo., crammed with tractors, grain augers and disks. There is a war on. When the white man ripped up the sod, he substituted an artificial ecosystem for a natural one. Nature, writhing as if under a net, struggles to reassert itself.    The net is composed of herbicides, irrigation systems which draw down the water table and radical new tillage practices. Maintaining the net requires ever-more-ingenious innovations.    One Texas experiment, for example, has tested a dryland tillage scheme that, in effect, requires abandoning half the land in order to save the remaining half. Alternate strips of land are super-hardened so rainwater runs right off of them. The water collects in the adjacent strips, where the crops are planted.    But most innovations are more benign. A new Texas irrigation technique &quot;spoonfeeds&quot; precisely measured amounts of water to small machine-formed basins around cotton plants. It cuts the water needed by one-half, while actually increasing yield.    &quot;I'm extremely optimistic,&quot; says William Lyle, a Texas Aandamp;M agricultural engineering professor who helped develop the technique. &quot;Twenty years ago I thought we were in a water-depletion spiral that possibly wouldn't stop. Now I believe we can effectively irrigate for another 50 to 100 years.&quot;    In northwest Kansas, where the Ogallala formation is thicker than in Texas, agriculture experts are nevertheless more cautious. Kansas State University specialists predict that, at the present rate, irrigation could last a half-century. But they are working on an underground drip-irrigation system that could double that, and new drought-tolerant crops could extend the day of reckoning longer still.    The inescapable fact, however, is that one day the water is going to run out or become too expensive to pump up. &quot;We're going to see less production. There's no way around it,&quot; says Kansas State extension economist Mark Nelson. &quot;But it's not going to be a cataclysmic thing.&quot;    He predicts a gradual switch-over from corn -- an &quot;oasis&quot; crop that can survive in these parts only through massive irrigation -- to dryland farming and wheat. With the corn, though, may go the sprawling, smelly beef-cattle feedlots that now pump economic vitality into Plains towns like Garden City, Kan.    But the land itself will remain -- the great, windswept land of gentle hills that turn blue-violet in the dusk. The land, and perhaps bison too, and certainly leathery survivors like rancher Howard Schreiber.    A lean and laconic 65, Mr. Schreiber talks in his living room, near Last Chance, Colo., as the meadowlarks sing outside. He talks of violent weather: Of the 24-hour period last winter when the temperature plunged from 80 degrees to 8 below, of the day last March when howling winds blew eastern Colorado and western Kansas topsoil all the way into Missouri. But mostly he talks of surviving along his Plum Bush Creek, surviving to the end of his days if he can.    &quot;I think it's the desire of everybody in the world to own their own land, don't you?&quot; he asks. </TEXT></DOC>
