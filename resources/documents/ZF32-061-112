(which recently mergedwith Paracomp) and Paracomp's FilmMaker can create stunning presentations,but they are difficult to learn and use.andP;  Magic combines the slide-showmetaphor of presentation programs with easy-to-use animation and linkingtools.andM;For this preview Paracomp provided us with a beta release of the application.andO;The features of the $395 product are all in place, according to the vendor,but we were told that changes may be made to the interface.andM;How does it work?andP;  Magic gives the user tools to create text and geometricshapes such as freehand curves, rectangles and circles.andP;  Graphics from otherprograms can be imported in PICT, PICS and Encapsulated PostScript format.andO;The graphic items are called Actors and appear on a background.andP;  A backgrounddenotes a segment of the presenta-tion and can have a color, pattern or evena graphic associated with it.andP;  Actors can be static or move within in thebackground.andP;  Links between backgrounds are attached to Actors, so when anActor is clicked, the presentation advances to a selected background.andM;Magic provides drawing tools for geometric primitives such as rectangles,circles and freehand curves.andP;  Any object can be edited by manipulating Beziercontrol points.andP;  The program lacks bit-mapped painting features; such imagesmust be imported from other programs.andP;  Images can be masked by drawing aroundthe area to be displayed or by selecting colors in the image with the EyeDropper tool.andM;Scan mode uses one object as a window on another object.andP;  This is similar toa Mask, but both objects can have their own motion path.andP;  For example, a ballcan bounce inside a box that is sliding across the screen.andM;The Timeline provides a visual display of the changes and movements of anobject.andP;  While other animation programs use the idea of a score or time lineto show the movement of an object, Magic does it differently.andP;  The lengths ofvisual effects are indicated by a vertical bar with three control pointsarranged at the top, middle and bottom.andP;  The bottom control marks the startof the effect, while the top point marks the end of the effect.andP;  By draggingeither of these points, the length of the visual effect is altered.andO;(Dragging the middle point moves both the beginning and ending points.)andM;The actual direction of movement of an Actor is drawn as an object on screenusing any of the drawing tools.andP;  The object is used as a path that the Actorfollows during the animation.andM;Go to links.andP;  Magic's links are like HyperCard buttons applied to Actors withthe Link palette.andP;  Clicking on an Actor in a presentation invokes the link,which sends the presentation to another background.andP;  There are six standardlinks, including Go To First, Last or Next background.andP;  A visual effect canoccur during the link.andP;  The Link To option will link to a specific background(when creating the link a dialog displays all the backgrounds in thedocument).andP;  Paracomp said that the release version of Magic will link toexternal QuickPICS and FilmMaker documents as well.andM;For those who want to create presentations quickly, Magic will include a setof standard templates and animations, as well as PICT files for use asbackgrounds.andP;  Paracomp also plans to include a library of sounds.andP;  In thebeta version, sounds must be pasted into the program via the Clipboard.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Many Mac users would like to add animation to theirpresentations but are intimidated by Director and FilmMaker.andP;  Magic attemptsto occupy a middle ground.andP;  Path-based animation is easy to create andmodify, while the Mask and Scan features add a level of complexity that evensome dedicated animation programs don't offer.andP;  We are impressed with Magic'sability to edit any object using Bezier control points.andM;Visual effects and sound capabilities further enhance the animations.andO;Despite this, we suspect that novice presentation makers will greatly dependupon the sample files and templates provided with the program.andM;Paracomp Inc. is at 1725 Montgomery St., Second Floor, San Francisco, Calif.andO;94111.andP;  Phone (415) 956-4091; fax (415) 956-9525.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
