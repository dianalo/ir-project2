Also today, an 8-year-old Palestinian boy died three days afterIsraeli soldiers shot him during a demonstration in the occupiedGaza Strip.   Forty Palestinians were detained in the east Jerusalemdisturbance, which took place as thousands of religious Jewsvisited Jerusalem for the eight-day Sukkot festival, policespokesman Uzi Sandori said.   The unrest began when students from the Rashadiyeh High Schoolblocked roads with rocks and showered police with stones, witnessessaid. Paramilitary border police fired tear gas and rubber bulletsto disperse the crowd, they said.   Sandori said five policemen were slightly injured from stones.Officials at Mukassed Hospital in east Jerusalem said about 15students were treated for tear-gas inhalation and bruises fromrubber bullets.   Israel radio said police were investigating whether the riot wassparked by the plans of militant Jews to lay a three-toncornerstone inside Jerusalem's Old City for what they hope will bea rebuilt Jewish temple.   The militants, who call themselves the Temple Mount Faithful,want to rebuild the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.   But police prevented them from taking the cornerstone off atruck and barred about 100 of the militants from going up to theTemple Mount.   The 35-acre Temple Mount site includes the spot where Moslemsbelieve the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven. The platform's twomosques, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa, are the holiest Islamicplaces of worship after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.   The Gaza boy, who died in Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv,was identified by the army as Qassem Abdallah Abu Lubda.   He was shot Friday in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza whensoldiers opened fire on Palestinian stone-throwers, the army said.The army said it was ``checking the circumstances of his injury.''   Also today, Israeli tax collectors backed by soldiers raided atleast seven shops on the main square of Nablus, the largest town inthe occupied West Bank with 120,000 residents.   An Arab reporter said the agents confiscated goods from thestores and sealed some with red wax to prevent them from reopeninguntil taxes are paid. The shops specialize in shoes, clothes,jewelry, photographs, and luggage.   Israeli authorities have stepped up tax raids in recent weeks totry to break a tax boycott called by the underground leaders of theuprising.   Boycotts and strikes have been the main economic weapons of theuprising.   Abu Lubda's death raised to 596 the number of Palestinianskilled by Israelis since the uprising began in December 1987. Atleast 130 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most onsuspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty Israelis have died inthe violence.</TEXT></DOC>
