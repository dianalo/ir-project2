(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories says it hasdeveloped an integrated circuit that can turn a computer chip'ssingle-lane processing of information into a busy freeway.   The photonic integrated circuit opens the way to vastly morepowerful computers, the company said Tuesday.   It will enable scientists to build optical computer systems,which would use light pulses as well as electricity to transmitinformation, ATandamp;T said from its Solid State Technology Center nearAllentown.   ``The results may be very important to everyone, once they starthappening'' within a few year to a decade, said Leo Chirovsky, aresearch scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, N.J. He citedweather forecasting as a possible application.   The device has 2,048 elements, each of which can switch on oroff in less than one-billionth of a second when illuminated by alow-power light beam.   If one thinks of a computer chip as a city, computers until nowhave been designed on the premise that information comes in andgoes out on narrow roads, Chirovsky said.   ``This is the equivalent of providing a huge, multi-lane highwayon a chip that will promote a whole new way of looking atcomputing,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
