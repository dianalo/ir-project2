The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office arrested TakashiKato, 58, the former vice minister of labor and the highest-rankingpublic official yet arrested in the scandal.   Kato was charged with accepting bribes from Recruit Co. in 1986,when he bought bargain-priced stocks in Recruit-Cosmos Co., asubsidiary. He allegedly earned about $56,000 in profits when helater sold the stock after the company went public and share pricesskyrocketed.   Prosecutors allege that Kato, in return for the stock deal,influenced a ministry decision on publishing employment informationthat would benefit Recruit, an information conglomerate.   Prosecutors today also arrested Masao Tatsumi, 46, a Recruitexecutive, who they claimed conspired with Recruit's founder andformer chairman, Hiromasa Ezoe, in bribing Kato.   The arrests brought to 12 the number of scandal-related arrests.Ezoe was apprehended Feb. 13 on bribery charges.   Two minor Recruit Co. officials were released Tuesday andprosecutors have yet to decide whether charges will be formallyfiled against them.   Kato's arrest had been widely anticipated since prosecutors lastmonth arrested Shigeru Kano, a junior officer to Kato, on briberycharges. Prosecutors today also searched Kato's residence inYokohama along with several Recruit branch offices in Tokyo.   The stock scandal, in which more than 150 politicians, publicofficials and business leaders were offered bargain shares inRecruit-Cosmos and earned handsome profits, has rocked theadministration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita since last summer.   Many politicians, including Takeshita and former Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, have been linked to the widening scandal after itwas revealed their aides had purchased thousands of the low-pricedshares.   Three Cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa, have already stepped down after their involvement in thescandal was revealed.   Meanwhile, opposition parties stalled deliberations in the Diet,the Japanese parliament, on the nation's budget and demanded theTakeshita administration resign en masse or summon Nakasone to theDiet for questioning on his involvement.   ``Without Nakasone appearing in the Diet, we cannot participatein the session,'' said Shun Ohide, an official of the JapanSocialist Party, the nation's largest opposition group.   ``You must resign now, Mr. Takeshita,'' said Socialist PartyChairman Takako Doi at a speech in northern Japan on Tuesday night.``If you can't resign en masse, you must dissolve the Diet andappeal to the confidence of the people by calling for an election.''   Takeshita repeatedly has called for political reform in effortsto leave the scandal behind, but almost daily developments havecaused the administration's popularity to plunge in media polls.   The newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Thursday that of 2,211adults polled, just 21.3 percent said they supported the Takeshitaadministration, down 6.1 percentage points from a similar poll inJanuary.   The January poll's findings marked first time below 30 percentfor Takeshita since he became prime minister in November 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
