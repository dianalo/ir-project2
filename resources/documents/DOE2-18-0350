The authors performedin vitro MR spectroscopy at 2 T (GE CSI imaging/spectrometer) on gallstonesfrom 14 patients and correlated with in vitro T1/T2 spin-echo images(1.5-T GE Signa scanner) subsequent chemical analysis. MR spectra couldbe observed from 11 of 14 stones. All 11 demonstrated a large water peak,and 10 showed a smaller lipid peak. Larger lipid peaks were not stoneswith larger central areas of high signal intensity or images (six stones)than in those with smaller areas of fair central signal intensity (fourstones). The lipid peaks corresponded qualitatively to the amount ofcholesterol presently determined by chemical analysis. The authors arecurrently investigating the use of water suppression sequences for bettercharacterization of the lipid signal.</TEXT></DOC>
