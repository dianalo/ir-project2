Releasing its annual rating of the top 100 military contractors,the Pentagon said McDonnell Douglas had jumped past GeneralDynamics Corp. and General Electric Co. to win the top ranking forfiscal 1987.   The St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas increased its Pentagonwork by $1.1 billion during the year to a new total of $7.7billion, easily surpassing General Dynamics.   General Dynamics, ranked No. 1 in fiscal 1986 with $8 billionworth of contracts, fell to No. 2 in 1987 with work valued at $7billion. General Electric also suffered a decline in contractawards, falling from the $6.8 billion it won in 1986 to $5.8billion in fiscal 1987, the Pentagon said.   The Defense Department report covers the fiscal year ending lastSept. 30, and is considered the most definitive gauge of how majormilitary contractors are faring each year.   The report discloses that the Pentagon's contractors werefighting over a smaller pie in fiscal 1987, with prime contractstotaling $142.5 billion being parceled out. That is $3.2 billionless than the total awarded in fiscal 1986.   Moreover, the top 100 companies, as a group, saw their share ofthose contracts decline slightly last year. The 100 firms received$95.4 billion of the contracts, or 66.9 percent of the total,compared to $98.6 billion and 67.7 percent in fiscal 1986.   According to the rankings, there was only one company in thefiscal 1986 top 10 that failed to stay in that number last year.Rockwell International Corp., which is winding down its work on thenew B-1B bomber, fell from fourth place on the 1986 list to 12thplace in fiscal 1987 with contracts worth $2.2 billion.   Rockwell's spot in the top 10 was claimed by Martin MariettaCorp., which moved from 11th to seventh place in the rankings withwork totaling $3.7 billion.   The other top 10 rankings involved the same companies as in1986, but in a different order.   The fourth largest defense contractor in 1987 was LockheedCorp., which won contracts totaling $5.6 billion. It improved fromsixth place the year before, when its military business totaled$4.9 billion.   Fifth in the rankings was General Motors Corp. with $4.1billion. That was a decline from the $5.1 billion in work won by GMin 1986, but still enough to keep it at the same spot in therankings.   Rounding out the top 10 were Raytheon Co., with $3.8 billion incontracts; Martin Marietta, with $3.7 billion; United TechnologiesCorp., with $3.6 billion; Boeing Co., with $3.5 billion, andGrumman Corp., with $3.4 billion.   McDonnell Douglas' rise to the No. 1 spot is nothing new for thegiant aircraft maker. While General Dynamics was No. 1 in 1986,McDonnell Douglas was the top-ranked contractor in fiscal 1984 andfiscal 1985.   Some of the company's larger contracts include the F-A-18 Hornetfighter for the Navy; the F-15 Eagle for the Air Force; the AH-64Apache helicopter gunship for the Army, and the AV-8B Harrier jumpjet for the Marine Corps.</TEXT></DOC>
