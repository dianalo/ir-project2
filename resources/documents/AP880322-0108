Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican church in southernAfrica, has angered President P.W. Botha by declaring that he andother church leaders will carry on the work of anti-apartheidgroups which last month were banned from operating.   Nineteen bishops, after an emergency meeting with Tutu, issued astatement warning that the government ``is driving this belovedcountry closer to civil war.''   ``We offer Archbishop Tutu our loyalty and support,'' thebishops said. ``We shall not allow the government to isolate him.''   Tutu, who declared that the government would ``bite the dust,''said it was important that Botha and other white South Africans``know that I am not just spouting forth things that come into myhead.''   ``These are responsible people,'' said Tutu, gesturing to thebishops. ``They would have knocked me down if they believed thatwhat I am saying is inconsistent with the gospel.''   Botha met with Tutu, the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize,last week and suggested that the archbishop had aligned himselfwith the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.   Referring to this, the bishops said they ``take grave offense atthe cavalier way'' in which Botha treated Tutu.   Among those attending today's meeting was Bishop Keith Sutton ofLichfield, England, who was sent as representative of theArchbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.   Runcie is spiritual leader of the 70-million-member worldwideAnglican communion.   ``He is a Christian leader,'' Sutton said of Tutu. ``Hisobjections to apartheid grow directly out of his pastoral work.''   At a news conference Monday, Tutu dared Botha to take actionagainst him.   ``If they try to restrict me or ban me, they are just wastingtheir time, because I will not obey their orders,'' Tutu said.``They will have to put me in jail.''   ``I can't keep looking over my shoulder to see if God has gotthe approval or disapproval of the government,'' he added.   Three weeks ago, Tutu and 24 other church leaders were arrestedand briefly detained after they tried to march to Parliament inCape Town with a petition protesting the latest crackdown onopposition.   Last month, the government banned 17 other organizations fromparticipating in any activity not approved by the government.   Since then Tutu and other church representatives have taken upthe struggle against apartheid, which by law and custom establishesa racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks haveno vote in national affairs.   South Africa's 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
