Authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational andCultural Exchange Act of 1961, Public Law 87-256 (Fulbright-Hays Act).The purpose of the Fulbright program is ``to enable the government of theUnited States to increase mutual understanding between the people of theUnited States and people of other countries.'' Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 15 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden to USIA Clearance Officer, M/ASP, U.S. Information Agency,301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20547; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503.<ITAG tagnum="21"> (Information collection involved in this program has been approvedby OMB Action Number 3116-0179, expiration date 11/30/89.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84"> Summary</ITAG> The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States InformationAgency (USIA or the Agency) invites applications from institutions of highereducation under the University Affiliations Program. Through the UniversityAffiliations Program, USIA provides grants for the development and strengtheningof linkages between U.S. and foreign institutions of higher education fora period of two to three years. The duration varies by geographic area. The goal of the program is to facilitate bilateral institutional relationsthrough faculty and staff exchanges. Participating institutions exchangefaculty and staff for teaching, lecturing, and research assignments ofone month or longer (with exceptions as noted for North Africa, MiddleEast, South Asia, and the American Republics); maintain their faculty/staffon full salary and benefits; and use grant funds to defray economy-classcosts for international travel, per diem expenses, planning trips, andpurchase of educational materials (up to 5% of the total grant amount)to be used at and donated to the foreign institution in countries or regionsindicated. Educational materials must be purchased in the U.S. Planningtrips for Project Directors (one in each direction) are allowable to completeplans before exchanges between the partners begin. Feasibility studiesneeded for the preparation of the proposal will not be funded. Proposalsfor research only will not be considered unless combined with substantialparticipation in graduate-level seminars and with the substantial collaborationof foreign nationals. The 1990 competition is limited to specific countriesand specific fields of study as indicated in each geographic area programdescription. The program design for each region describes variations inallowable activities (see below). In the U.S., program participation is open to accredited U.S. institutionsof higher education, including graduate schools, four-year colleges anduniversities; and consortia of universities (proposals may be submittedby a member institution or an organization with authority to representthe consortium). Community and two-year colleges are eligible only forthe ``Geographic Area Program Competition'' in the American Republics.For consortia of institutions, specific responsibilities of each institutionand aspects of proposed program participation should be defined. Overseas participation is open to recognized degree-granting institutionsof higher education and independent research institutes. Eligible research institutes are defined as reputable, non-partisan, non-profit,private or public research institutions that have produced significantlong-term scholarly research published in nationally recognized journalsor other publications; and have national (and preferably international)professional recognition. Exchange projects including research instituteswill be considered only if the institute works in a field of high scholarlyvalue to the U.S. university, if proposed exchanges cannot otherwise takeplace without USIA assistance, and if they include a group of highly trainedspecialists not otherwise reached. Participants traveling under USIA grant support must be U.S. citizens,if representing the U.S. partner institution, and nationals of the countryof the foreign partner. Subject to the availability of funds in Fiscal Year 1990, approximately20 grants will be available on a competitive basis for specific geographiclocations and themes. Awards will reflect Agency priorities and academicconsiderations. Complete program criteria and application guidelines appearbelow. All proposals recommended for funding will be subject to Agency reviewfor conformity to relevant OMB and legal guidelines. Funding of any proposalis subject to the regular procedures, regulations and requirements forBureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs grants, including review byUSIA's Office of General Counsel and submission for approval to the Boardof Foreign Scholarships. U.S. institutions should collaborate with their foreign partners on planningand preparing proposals. U.S. institutions are also responsible for thesubmission of proposals which must reach USIA no later than 5:00 p.m. EST,Thursday, February 15, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">Geographic Area Program Competition_Africa</ITAG><T3>Description of Program:</T3> Grants for the exchange of faculty andstaff.
