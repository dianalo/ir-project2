One week ago, a federal judge barred financier VictorPosner from exercising any control over DWG Corp., pending anaudit to determine whether he plundered the Miami-basedholding company.</LP><TEXT>   Now, stock analysts and a few savvy investors such asSteinhardt Partners and Merrill Lynch are betting that if Mr.Posner is forced to remain on the sidelines, DWG shares willtake off.   &quot;Anything that can corral old Mr. Posner is good forstockholders,&quot; says Jeremy Bloomer, managing director ofCredit Research andamp; Trading, Greenwich, Conn., who follows somePosner-led companies. Mr. Posner &quot;takes a hell of a lot ofmoney out of his companies,&quot; the analyst says.   Yesterday, DWG stock climbed 1/8 to 6 5/8. That's up from4 5/8 a week ago and 1 3/4 in late October. DWG is thecenterpiece of Mr. Posner's empire. Mr. Posner controls 46.3%of the company, which has interests in Arby's, the restaurantcompany; Royal Crown, the soft-drink concern; Graniteville, atextile manufacturer; and several other companies.   Judge Thomas D. Lambros of U.S. District Court inCleveland barred Mr. Posner and his son, Steven, from runningDWG for 120 days, pending an audit. In a sharply worded23-page decision, Judge Lambros wrote that Mr. Posner&quot;continues to stomp on the rights of shareholders, officersand directors, by reigning over DWG as if it were hispersonal fiefdom.&quot;   Trouble is no stranger to the feisty, 74-year-old Mr.Posner, who has seen several companies he controls wind up inbankruptcy court. He isn't taking the judge's action lyingdown. His attorney, Donald Glazer, intends to seek a stay ata hearing Monday.   But if Mr. Posner fails in his bid to regain control ofDWG, some analysts are betting that the shares can climb to15 or beyond.   &quot;If Posner steps aside, the values are certainlypotentially $20 a share, or higher,&quot; says Aaron Lehmann, aNew York investment analyst and private investor who hasfollowed DWG for years. Mr. Lehmann says he has been snappingup additional DWG shares this week.   The risk for DWG investors, Mr. Lehmann says, is that ifMr. Posner &quot;prevails, the stock could go down.&quot; However, hesays &quot;that risk has been diminished&quot; by Judge Lambros.   Some investors believe that, in the wake of the audit, DWGwill probably be sold or liquidated over the course of thenext 18 months. While DWG may not necessarily command the$22-a-share price that Mr. Posner rejected as &quot;inadequate&quot; in1989, it could do nearly as well if it is sold off piecemeal,this argument goes.   DWG operates under a mountain of debt, totaling $461.2million as of Oct. 31. But even so, analysts believe thatthere is still plenty of value for stockholders. Some peopleestimate that DWG could fetch as much as $225 million for itsGraniteville interest, and that Royal Crown could sell for asmuch as $325 million.   In 1989, Mr. Posner rejected a $200 million offer forDWG's Arby's roast-beef-sandwich chain. The chain would stillcommand at least $120 million, analysts say. DWG also ownsNational Propane, a natural gas distributor, and controlsSoutheastern Public Service, a publicly traded company thatspecializes in tree maintenance, refrigeration, among otherbusinesses.   Mr. Lehmann estimates that the company's businesses couldfetch a total of as much as $900 million, after payment ofdebt, or about $30 a share. But he says that an estimated $10a share should be deducted to allow for liabilities thatmight arise from the audit.   Three DWG directors designated by Judge Lambros inconnection with a settlement of shareholder litigation lastyear have reported a number of questionable acts they say Mr.Posner committed during the past year.   Among them, the three court-designated directors assertedin a report to the board in 1991, Mr. Posner received cashcompensation of $3.6 million from DWG, while Steven Posnerreceived $665,000. They alleged, among other things, that DWGalso lent more than $47 million to the now-bankruptPennsylvania Engineering, which Mr. Posner controls, and thatMr. Posner charged 396 meals, at an average cost of $74 ameal, to DWG during the last year. Mr. Posner didn't returncalls yesterday.   Harold Kelley, an Ashland, Ky., lawyer and accountant whois a court-designated director, agrees that Mr. Posner'sdeparture could do wonders for the company's stock price. Thelast time the stock took a huge jump was Oct. 31, when DWGshares climbed to 3 1/2 from 1 7/8. That time, Mr. Kelleysays, &quot;There was a rumor around that Mr. Posner died.&quot;   ---   DWG Corp.
