We're talking tax returns, that is, not divorces. Whereas most two-income couples have been better off filing jointly in the past, &quot;filing separately for 1987 may save taxes,&quot; says Sidney Kess, a tax partner at the New York-based accounting firm Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co.    Tax rates are still lower for joint filers than they are for couples who split their income on two returns, but the difference is smaller than it used to be because there are fewer tax brackets -- five this year, instead of 14 in 1986. Moreover, because of other changes in the tax code, couples that file jointly have lost some deductions and will find it harder to qualify for others.    Congress has eliminated what had been a major benefit of filing jointly, the two-wage-earner deduction. That so-called marriage-penalty relief used to allow couples to subtract 10% of the income of the lower-earning spouse, up to $3,000, from their combined adjusted gross income.    Husbands and wives who file jointly also will have more difficulty writing off certain expenses. Miscellaneous expenses -- which now include unreimbursed employee business expenses, as well as such investment and tax expenses as investment advisory fees, safe-deposit box rentals and tax-preparation fees -- are deductible only to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. Previously they were fully deductible. Similarly, only the portion of medical expenses that exceeds 7.5% of adjusted gross income may be deducted; that's up from 5% last year.    If most of those expenses belong to one spouse, &quot;the main reason for filing separately would be to meet those new, higher thresholds,&quot; says Daniel Eule, a tax manager at accounting firm Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells in New York.    By filing separately, some high-income couples may get to make a tax-deductible contribution to an individual retirement account that wouldn't be permitted if they filed jointly. The 1986 tax act prevents couples with combined adjusted gross income of more than $40,000 from fully deducting IRA contributions if one or both spouses is covered by a company retirement plan and they file jointly. None of the contribution is deductible if their combined adjusted gross income is $50,000 or more.    But if only one spouse is covered by a company retirement plan and the couple files separately, the spouse not covered can deduct part of the money contributed to an IRA if his or her adjusted gross income is less than $10,000. Pending legislation, however, is likely to wipe out that opportunity after this year.    Filing separate returns also could save state taxes. Several states, including New York and California, amended their tax codes this year to require couples who file joint federal returns to also pay state income taxes jointly. But both New York and California have lower rates for couples who file separately. Because state income taxes are still deductible, however, &quot;that shouldn't be the focus of the decision&quot; whether to file jointly on the federal level, says Arthur Gelber, tax partner at Laventhol andamp; Horwath in New York.    Some couples have more to lose than gain by filing separately. They include many elderly couples who might have to pay taxes on more of their Social Security payments. For married couples filing separately, 50% of their Social Security payments are taxed. Filing jointly, however, couples don't pay any taxes on Social Security unless 50% of such payments, plus their other income including tax-exempt interest, exceeds $32,000.    Other couples who own real estate that they actively manage, such as rental property, could miss out by filing separately. On a joint return, they would be entitled to as much as $25,000 of &quot;passive&quot; losses from such rental activities that would offset their regular salary and dividend income. Couples who file separately &quot;don't get any part of this special allowance,&quot; says Deloitte Haskins's Mr. Eule.    But, he adds, &quot;You can't look at any one item and come to a conclusion that it's better to file one way or the other.&quot; Many couples might as well get used to doing the extra paperwork of figuring their taxes both ways. &quot;More advantages to filing separately kick in next year,&quot; he says.    Of course, for those who really are in the midst of a matrimonial breakup, there is hope in sight. &quot;Get those papers signed before the end of the year,&quot; says Mr. Kess of Peat Marwick. Tax rates for single individuals are still lower than they are for married couples, whether couples file jointly or separately. </TEXT></DOC>
