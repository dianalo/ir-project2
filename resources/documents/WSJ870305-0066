It is a hoax on the countryside as well as on urban taxpayers.&quot; So began a series of editorials and articles in the Des Moines Register, the most influential Farm Belt newspaper. The costs of U.S. farm policy -- in both human and dollar terms -- have simply grown too large to be ignored by anyone.    U.S. farm policy has careened from one misguided government intervention to another. With each new program -- whether it be loan guarantees, price supports or export subsidies -- the farm problem gets a little worse and the price a little more expensive. Spending on agricultural price supports -- $4 billion in 1981 -- cost taxpayers $26 billion last year.    Increases of that magnitude prompted Register editors to assign a team of reporters to examine current farm policy. The paper's editorial conclusion was blunt: &quot;Never before have Americans spent so many tax dollars on agriculture, and never have the results been more destructive to the kind of rural life that Americans profess to want.&quot; Noting that less than one farm-program dollar out of every three goes to a farmer in financial distress, the Register suggested limiting subsidies to a safety-net program for medium- and small-sized farms. We agree paying subsidies up to only a moderate level of production would end some of the worst abuses, but tougher measures are also needed.    You would think that after 50 years of failure to stabilize crop prices, politicians would be convinced that, whatever label it is sold under, federal farm policy is highly toxic stuff -- and expensive to boot.    But politicians believe -- wrongly, we think -- that they can't get any Farm Belt votes by running on a platform of cold turkey. Not when government income subsidies now make up 40% of net cash farm income, up from only 6% in 1981. That explains the program that Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the first declared Democratic candidate for president, is pushing. He and Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) have introduced legislation that would impose mandatory production controls on wheat and feed grains by allowing growers to vote on whether or not to restrict output.    As the Register pointed out, this would plant the seeds for a command-and-control farm economy. A version of this concept appeared in the recent TV miniseries &quot;Amerika.&quot; The results were predictable: high consumer prices and spot shortages of basic foodstuffs, the whole scheme monitored by squads of &quot;Wheat Police&quot; making sure farmers didn't sneak out of their fields with some extra bushels for the black market.    Another pair of legislators, Rudy Boschwitz (R., Minn.) and David Boren (D., Okla.), has a better remedy for America's farm hangover. They argue that the only realistic way Washington will ever get out of the subsidy business is to buy its way out. They suggest paying farmers, whether they grow anything or not, about what they got last year, but then reduce their payments year by year. This would &quot;decouple&quot; income-support payments to farmers from price and volume controls on commodities, thus allowing market forces to determine what crops are produced on what land. Farmers, knowing that their payments would eventually end, would be encouraged to either become more efficient or go into another line of work. The Reagan administration supports a scaled-down version of the concept and last week a House Agriculture subcommittee passed a pilot decoupling program for wheat.    While decoupling makes sound economic sense, farm groups worry that it will alter the political calculus against them. As the Register reported, &quot;an outright policy of giving farmers money without those payments being based on production would firmly fix agriculture subsidies as welfare payments in the public's mind. It wouldn't be long before reporters found some farmer having fun in Las Vegas, gambling with his taxpayer dollars while his land was left idle back home.&quot; Exactly. That is what is called truth in spending.    There is also some reason to believe that those who depend on agriculture for a living may be receptive to a free-market farm program. A surprising 32% of Iowans surveyed last October favored a decoupling plan proposed by Pete duPont, former Delaware governor and Republican presidential candidate, which would end all farm-support programs within five years. Mr. du Pont's plan was even backed by 27% of farm households.    American farmers are trapped by policies that encourage dependency, price U.S. farm commodities out of the world market and largely subsidize wealthy or inefficient farmers. It's time that farmers themselves recognize the Farm Hoax for what it is -- a game in which the only lasting winners are politicians and bureaucrats -- and demand solutions that involve more than an endless picking of the taxpayer's pocket. </TEXT></DOC>
