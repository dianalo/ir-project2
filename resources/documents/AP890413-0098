KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawmakers clashed today over President Bush'splan to sustain the Nicaraguan Contra rebels with $49.7 million innon-lethal aid, with opponents charging the package ``hinges onwinks, nods and handshakes.''   The House debated the compromise plan, which would give theContras additional food, clothing and medical assistance but wouldbar new money for weapons and ammunition to renew the battleagainst Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   Congress was poised to approve the plan that was hammered out inweeks of negotiations between Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIand Democratic leaders of the House and Senate.   Senate consideration of the plan was delayed today whenRepublicans declined to say what amendments they planned, accordingto Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. Democratsplanned no amendments to the agreement.   ``President Bush telephoned me this morning, urged me to movethis legislation promptly ... and made clear his opposition to anyamendments to the legislation,'' Mitchell said.   The majority leader called it ironic that members of Bush'sparty were unwilling to go along with the agreement worked out byleaders.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., meanwhile, said hewould oppose all amendments, in keeping with the compromise.   In the House, Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois urgedsupport for the agreement, telling his colleagues that what theagreement ``lacks in perfection it makes up in real effective helpfor the cause of progress and democracy in Nicaragua and CentralAmerica.''   ``I wish we could do better but as legislators it's not given tous to act only when conditions are perfect,'' Michel said.   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, said that with the agreement, ``at last we havewhat is more than a narrowly based consensus.''   But Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., cited the Democraticcontention that continued support for the Contras would derail thediplomatic peace process.   Foglietta also said the plan would keep the Contras in place andnot integrate them into Nicaraguan society.   ``This accord hinges on winks, nods and handshakes,'' he said.``I'd really like to say I trust this new administration, the Bushadministration, for reintegration of the Contras. But how can Iwhen I read ... that then-Vice President Bush played a role insupplying covert aid to the Contras.''   On Wednesday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said, ``I thinkeverybody _ whether they have supported or opposed the Contras inthe past _ knows that this is the end of the Contra war. It's notgoing to start up again. The Contra war is over.''   Leahy commented shortly after the Senate AppropriationsCommittee voted 18-2 to recommend the aid package be approved. TheHouse Appropriations committee earlier voted 34-10 to endorse themeasure.   Most of the emotional steam that marked nearly a decade ofdivisive congressional debate over Contra aid was missing.   But Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., a longtime Contra aidsupporter, said the accord represents ``nothing more than a show ofsurrender.'' Leahy, in turn, characterized Hollings' comments as``natural bitterness'' shared by many Contra supporters.   Leahy said the Bush administration is to be commended forrecognizing that former President Reagan's policy of arming theContras to serve as surrogates for the United States in Nicaraguahad failed.   On Wednesday, Baker said approval of the bipartisan planrepresents the only way to get the United States ``back into theballgame in Central America.''   ``Up to now, we have been out of the ballgame because we had thelegislature going in one direction and the executive going inanother direction and we couldn't function,'' Baker told the SenateAppropriations foreign operations subcommittee. ``Today, for thefirst time, we have an opportunity to speak with one voice to thepeople of Central America.''   But Baker said the plan also represents an acid test of whetherthe Sandinistas will keep the promises made at the August 1987accord signed in Guatemala City by five Central American presidents.   It calls for free and fair elections in Nicaragua and fordemocratic reforms, including the removal of restrictions on thepress and the release of political prisoners.   The aid plan also calls for spending an additional $4.2 millionfor medical assistance for civilian victims of the war in Nicaraguaand earmarks an additional $5 million for the Agency forInternational Development (AID) for operating expenses in conveyingthe new aid to the Contras.   The plan also permits some of the aid money to be used for thevoluntary reintegration of the Contras into Nicaraguan society ortheir relocation elsewhere in the region.   Although the aid funds are to be approved through February ofnext year, Congress will be given an opportunity in November toreview the situation and halt the aid if it sees fit.</TEXT></DOC>
