L. 95-541), hasdeveloped regulations that implement the ``Agreed Measures for the Conservationof Antarctic Fauna and Flora'' for all United States citizens. The AgreedMeasures, developed in 1964 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties,recommended establishment of a permit system for various activities inAntarctica and designation of certain mammals and certain geographic areasas requiring special protection. The regulations establish such a permitsystem and designate Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special ScientificInterest. The regulations may be found at Title 45, Part 670 of the Codeof Federal Regulations. Copies are available from the National ScienceFoundation.The purpose of the regulations is to conserve and protect the mammals,birds, and plants of Antarctica and the ecosystem upon which they depend.To that end, unless the following activities are specifically authorizedby permit, it is unlawful:andbullet; To take any mammal or bird native to Antarctica (note that ``take''means ``to remove, harass, molest, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill,trap, capture, restrain, or tag'' any native mammal or bird or to attemptto engage in such conduct)andbullet; To collect any plant native to Antarctica in specially protectedareasandbullet; To enter any Specially Protected Area or certain Sites of SpecialScientific Interestandbullet; To import into or export from the United States any mammal orbird native to Antarctica or any plant collected in a Specially ProtectedAreaandbullet; To introduce to Antarctica any non-indigenous plant or animal.The Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 mandates civil and criminal penaltiesfor noncompliance with the regulations.All mammals and birds normally found in Antarctica, excluding whales regulatedby the International Whaling Commission, are designated as native mammalsor native birds. Activities involving these mammals or birds require apermit. Areas of outstanding ecological interest are designated as SpeciallyProtected Areas. No one may enter these areas or collect any native plantsin these areas without a permit. Areas of unique scientific value thatneed protection from interference are designated as Sites of Special ScientificInterest. Entry into certain of these areas without a permit is prohibited.The permit system is described in the regulations. To obtain a permit,each applicant must provide the scientific names and numbers of nativemammals or birds to be taken, including age, size, sex, and condition (e.g.,pregnant or nursing) or the scientific names and numbers of native plantsto be collected in a Specially Protected Area. Each applicant must includea complete description of the location, the time period, and the mannerof taking or collecting specimens. If the specimens are to be importedinto the United States, the applicant must also indicate the ultimate dispositionof the materials.Permits for taking or collecting mammals, birds, or plants will be issuedby the Director of the National Science Foundation or his designated representative.Each permit will be evaluated in terms of the objectives of the AntarcticConservation Act, that is, the conservation and protection of antarcticflora and fauna and the antarctic ecosystem. Permits issued under theseregulations (or copies of them) must be held in the possession of thoseauthorized to engage in a permitted action. The permits must be displayedupon request to any person responsible for enforcing the regulations.Anyone who knowingly commits an act prohibited by the Antarctic ConservationAct of 1978 is liable to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation.If the violation was committed without knowledge of the regulations, thefine will not exceed $5,000. Criminal penalties for willful violation ofthe regulations may involve a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonmentfor not more than 1 year.The Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 does not supersede the Marine MammalProtection Act, the Endangered Species Act, or the Migratory Bird TreatyAct. Permit applications involving native mammals or native birds coveredby these acts will be forwarded by NSF to the agencies that administerthem. If a proposed activity involves approval under more than one law,then the activity must satisfy the conditions of all applicable laws ora permit cannot be granted. Even if a permit is approved by other appropriateagencies, the Director of the National Science Foundation still must decidewhether to issue a permit according to the requirements of the AntarcticConservation Act of 1978.The applications received by the National Science Foundation are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">1.

The objectiveof the project is to isolate and sequence the antifreeze peptide (AFP)genes from Austrolycicthys brachycephalus and Rhigophila dearborni. Toaccomplish this, the DNA from each fish will be isolated, cut into fragments,and packaged into lambda phage. E. coli is used as a host for amplicationof the phage. The gene libraries will provide information to help morecompletely understand the production, regulation, structure, and functionof these peptides. The applicant requests permission to transport to McMurdoStation, Antarctica a supply of E. coli (bacteria) and lambda phage (virus)for the 1989-1990 season.The actual use of the E. coli and lambda bacteriophage will be under sterile,non-contaminating laboratory conditions. All waste and glassware will beautoclaved, as dictated by proper molecular biology laboratory technique,before disposal. The genomic libraries will be hand-carried back to theUniversity of Illinois.B. Location<ITAG tagnum="14">Ekland Biology Laboratory, McMurdo Station, Antarctica</ITAG>C.
