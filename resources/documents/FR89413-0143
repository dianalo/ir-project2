As a result of plugging additional steamgenerator tubes, the licensee exceeded the 15 percent value establishedin its safety analysis which required that the safety analysis be completelyreviewed again to account for additional steam generator tube plugging.The licensee has elected to conduct the safety analyses assuming that 20percent of all tubes in all three steam generators are plugged. In addition,the licensee has reanalyzed the main steam line break accident with moreconservative time delays and a lower concentration of boric acid in theinjection line. Finally, the licensee has reanalyzed the reactor coolantpump locked rotor and shaft break accidents to provide for reactor tripsettings appropriate for lowered reactor coolant temperature operation. The Need for the Proposed Action  The proposed amendment is required to operate in Fuel Cycle 10 as describedabove.  Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action  The reanalysis has provided assurance that all acceptance criteria forpostulated accidents continue to be satisfied with some small adjustmentsin the technical specifications. Therefore, the proposed action would notinvolve a significant change in the probability or consequences of anyaccident previously evaluated, nor does it involve a new or different kindof accident. Consequently, any radiological releases resulting from anaccident would not be significantly greater than previously determined.The proposed amendment does not otherwise affect routine radiological planteffluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Commission also concludes that the proposed action will not resultin a significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiationexposure.  With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.  The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3169). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.  Alternatives to the Proposed Action  Because the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed action, there is no need to examinealternatives to the proposed action.  Alternative Use of Resources  This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Final Environmental Statement related to operationof San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit No. 1, dated October 1973. Agencies and Persons Consulted  The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request that supports the proposedamendment. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact  </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment.  Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.
