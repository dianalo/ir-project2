The company began a $7.50-a-share, or $17.6 million, tender offer for Vicon last month. On Monday, Sensormatic said, it delivered a letter to the Vicon board containing a higher offer, the value of which it wouldn't disclose.    A Sensormatic official said Vicon, a Melville, N.Y.-based maker of closed-circuit television equipment for surveillance purposes, didn't respond by a deadline yesterday. He said Sensormatic withdrew the bid and has no further plans to negotiate with Vicon.    Late yesterday, Vicon called the $7.50-a-share offer &quot;inadequate.&quot; According to Vicon, Sensormatic said it wouldn't increase its offer unless certain Vicon executives agreed to work for Sensormatic under terms specified by Sensormatic. Vicon said the executives refused to work under those terms.    In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, Vicon closed unchanged at $7.50 a share. In national over-the-counter-trading, Sensormatic's shares closed at $10.125, up 25 cents.    Sensormatic, a video and electronic security concern, said its initial tender offer will remain in effect until Dec. 23. Sensormatic said the offer remains subject to, among other conditions, a waiver by Vicon's board of a recently enacted New York state anti-takeover statute or judicial determination that the statute is invalid. </TEXT></DOC>
