REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Communist gunmen killed a soldier anda policeman in a suburb of the capital today in the second deadlyattack by urban guerrillas in two days, police said.   Elsewhere, the military said about 200 communist New People'sArmy rebels raided a northern mountain village, set fire to apolice detachment and kidnapped a policeman.   President Corazon Aquino vowed today to crack down on crime andpursue an ``unrelenting campaign'' against communists.   She told a conference of 1,700 newly elected mayors andgovernors that their main task will be to restore order.   ``The first and most important is law and order throughout theland,'' the president said. ``This calls for curbing criminalityand the destruction of rightist and leftist elements in our societythat are bent on the overthrow of our government and ourdemocracy.''   She also called for breaking up illegal gambling syndicates and``flushing out and shutting down the vice dens.''   In suburban Pasig today, four gunmen opened fire on Tech. Sgt.Norberto Fungo as he was walking near the public market, policesaid. As they were escaping, the rebels opened fire on PatrolmanSeverino Francisco as he tried to draw his pistol, police added.   The gunmen commandeered a passenger jeep and escaped.   The killings occurred one day after two men and two women gunneddown Margarita Tenorio, 62, a ward leader and president of theanti-communist vigilante Crusaders for Peace and Democracy.   Police said the assailants scattered leaflets claimingresponsibility in the name of the ``Jun Somono Squad'' of the AlexBoncayao Brigade, a rebel urban guerrilla group that killed scoresof police and soldiers in the capital last year.   Somono, an urban guerrilla, was slain last year by police.   The attack on the police detachment occurred Thursday inSadanga, about 180 miles north of Manila.   A constabulary report said police manning the outpost put up abrief fight but surrendered after two defenders were wounded. Thereport said the rebels confiscated police firearms, burned down theoutpost and took a patrolman hostage before fleeing to the forest.   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in a February 1986military-civilian revolt that ousted President Ferdinand Marcosafter 20 years in power.   The military chief of staff said today he did not believe thetime was right to allow Marcos to return from exile in Hawaii.   ``If you would ask me personally, it is not advisable for him tobe back at this time,'' Gen. Renato de Villa told reporters.   The general's remarks follow reports that two of Mrs. Aquino'srelatives met with Marcos in Hawaii to discuss terms for hispossible return.   De Villa said former military officers implicated in coupattempts remain at large in the country and Marcos' return mightjeopardize security. But he expressed doubts that the Marcos groupscould muster enough support to topple the government.</TEXT></DOC>
