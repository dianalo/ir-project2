Heileman Brewing Co. is the target of a $38-a-share takeover bid by Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., Australia's second-largest brewer.    The unsolicited offer has an indicated value of $1.01 billion based on Heileman's 26.6 million common shares outstanding.    In La Crosse, Wis., a Heileman executive late last night said the company hadn't been contacted by Bond Corp. and that management was unaware of the offer. Terms of the offer are disclosed in an advertisement in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Heileman closed at $33.875, up 50 cents. The offer was disclosed after the markets closed.    Industry analysts said the offer by Bond Corp. follows recent speculation that Heileman's depressed earnings performance and shrinking market share would attract suitors. &quot;They have been the subject of speculation as a takeover target,&quot; said Martin Romm, an analyst at First Boston Corp.    The nation's fourth-largest brewer, Heileman may be the most vunerable of its peers to a takeover. The No. 1 brewer, St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Cos. is hard to swallow because of its size and financial muscle; sales topped $7.6 billion last year. No. 2 ranked Miller Brewing Co. is a unit of Philip Morris Cos. No. 3 ranked Stroh Cos. is closely held.    Representatives of Bond Corp. couldn't immediately be reached for comment late yesterday. Perth-based Bond Corp. is headed by Alan Bond, who is best known in the U.S. as the millionaire sailor who took the America's Cup to Australia.    An acquisition of Heileman would greatly expand Bond Corp.'s presence in the U.S. Bond Corp. currently operates a small U.S. brewer, Pittsburgh Brewing Co.    Heileman makes 12 major brands of beer, including Old Style, Lone Star, and Black Label and controls about 8% of the U.S. market, although its share of the business has slipped since 1983. Heileman's leading brand, Old Style, accounted for 3.8 million barrels of beer in 1986.    Heileman has been trying to increase its competitive muscle against the more powerful national brands by acquiring smaller brewers. The company has been stymied, however, at attempts to acquire a national brand of its own. Under Russell G. Cleary, Heileman's combative chairman and chief executive, the company has made unsuccessful takeover runs at Pabst Brewing Co. and Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., which Stroh acquired.    The Bond Corp. offer is subject to the tender of 75% of Heileman's common outstanding and the removal of a poison-pill provision that Heileman created two years ago. Bond is orchestrating its offer through its Amber Acquisition Corp. unit. The offer and withdrawal rights expire midnight EDT, Oct. 2, unless extended.    Heileman's second-quarter earnings were depressed by aggressive price competition and market-share battles in the beer industry. Net income fell 8% to $18.6 million, or 70 cents a share, from $20.2 million, or 77 cents a share, in a year earlier. Sales declined 3% to $331.7 million from $339.9 million a year earlier.    Mr. Bond, chairman of Bond Corp., has a reputation as one of Australia's toughest businessmen. After dabbling in real estate, he got control of the Swan Brewery. He later expanded into television and radio stations as well as a department store chain.    According to recently published reports, Mr. Bond holds a 52% stake in Bond Corp. directly and through family interests. </TEXT></DOC>
