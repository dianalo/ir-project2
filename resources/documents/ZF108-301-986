 After all, multimedia computers can store andmanipulate text, graphics, images, animation, music, audio, video and variousother symbols and structures -- what else is there?andP;  Quite a lot, really.andO;Just looking at these data types, there are some significant limitations.andM;For example, computers store text well, but most display and print it poorly.andO;Reading from a screen isn't something a lot of people want to do for long.andO;Many printers offer readable text, but human design is still heavily neededto layout and organize text.andM;Graphics and images, especially in color, create big storage and transmissionproblems, even if you only want to store a few.andP;  And the serious audiovisualstuff, motion video and audio, are very far from having widespread impact.andM;Despite the variety of products that are around the corner -- an hour ofvideo on a CD-ROM, 200:1 still image compression, color scanners, authoringtools of all sorts, etc.andP;  -- the idea that we'll live in a digital world is afantasy.andP;  For decades, the majority of the world's information will remain inits current forms -- paper, analog recordings, microfilm, etc.andM;Multimedia computers will be able to do an excellent job of helping peoplefind that information, long before they are able to provide direct access toa really rich array of digital information.andM;Multimedia in schoolsandM;This need was brought to the forefront of our attention by a major potentialcustomer for multimedia systems -- the office of the CaliforniaSuperintendent of Schools.andM;The problem with multimedia educational products, we learned, is that they'vetended to be very anecdotal.andP;  Teachers find that they lack the breadth anddepth necessary to make multimedia courseware truly a part of a course.andM;California has chosen to address the problem through a project called Science2000, which is a seventh-grade science course resource management system forteachers.andP;  Using applications such as Apple's HyperCard or IBM's Linkway tocontrol videodiscs, text and graphic information about science, the systemwill also store lesson plans and identify resources for teaching a course.andO;Resources might include:andM;* Chapters from textbooks;andM;* Other printed materials;andM;* Videotapes;andM;* Videodiscs;andM;* Films and film strips.andM;The resources identified in the application might be in the classroom, theschool, the school district, or available from the state or other sources.andO;The major contractor for Science 2000 is Decision Development Corp.andP;  It's abig project -- the total budget is about $1.3 million, which includes$400,000 in-kind contributions from IBM and Apple.andM;Why include external resources?andM;It's important to understand why multimedia products don't work well in aneducational setting without integration into existing resources.andP;  We'd arguethat this tends to be the case in other information systems, too.andM;The reason is very basic -- audiovisual communication is very good at showingthe surface of things, but ineffective at offering detailed informationexcept in special cases when motion or audio must be communicated.andP;  For thevast world of verbal and numerical information, audiovisual communication isless effective than text and numbers.andP;  That's why we have books, newspapers,magazines, and so forth.andM;We use a four-layer reference model for multimedia systems, outlined in theJanuary, 1990 issue.andP;  The layers, simplified, are:andM;* IntroductionandM;* NavigationandM;* AcquisitionandM;* CreationandM;Audiovisuals are highly effective in the first layer, introduction, in whichthe goal is orientation and motivation.andP;  The second layer, navigation, iswhere we're proposing an enhancement, so that navigation doesn't just takeyou to more computer-based information -- it can also take you to externalresources.andM;The third layer, information acquisition, uses audiovisual material in alimited way.andP;  Animation, video and audio are useful to show places and timesthat the user can't go to, or to demonstrate things that are only practicalto communicate with motion or audio, such as the movement of a dancer or thesound of a bell.andP;  Of course, anything found through the navigation system canalso serve as introduction and motivation -- a top layer -- to additionalinformation.andM;The fourth layer, creation, includes tools that enable users to createanything in the earlier layers.andP;  Integrating index information is an exampleof using creative tools to augment the navigation layer.andM;Indexing the worldandM;There are many products that offer electronic indexes to &quot;real-world&quot;materials.andP;  They include electronic catalogs of all sorts.andP;  But they'rerarely integrated with other indexes or with content, and that's what needsto happen.andM;A couple of publishers have announced &quot;multimedia encyclopedias&quot; thatpresumably add value by allowing rapid searching, hypertext links, animatedimages, audio and so forth.andP;  There's a much more substantial value that canbe added by linking the encyclopedia to other resources.andP;  After all, anencyclopedia only gives a little bit of information about each of the manytopics it covers.andM;Audiovisual data eats up storage space in a hurry, even by CD-ROM standards,potentially leaving relatively little room for text, graphic and numericalinformation.andP;  If a computer-based encyclopedia primarily offers anaudiovisual &quot;experience&quot; of a topic, then it will have reduced itself tooffering little more than television.andP;  That would be a reduction in value,not an increase, compared with paper-based encyclopedias.andM;There's a better way.andM;Imagine a high school student using a multimedia encyclopedia as the startingpoint for a school paper on the Kennedy-Nixon debates in 1960.andP;  Theencyclopedia will have a bit of information about the debates, but notenough.andP;  Now imagine that as the student searches, he or she also finds outthat there are several books that cover the debates, as well as a videotapeof the actual debates, available at the local libraries.andP;  Armed withreferences, the student can go to the library and find the materials.andO;Ideally, he or she might even be able to have the computer verify that thematerials are available, via modem.andM;Why not take the next obvious step, and have the student read or view thematerials on-line?andP;  The answer is simple -- cost.andP;  Decades will pass beforeany substantial proportion of resource materials are available on-line.andO;There's just too much stuff out there and the cost of moving it to digitalforms is high.andP;  Further, the cost of computers and switching equipment togive many people access to information is high.andM;Those things will happen, someday.andP;  Integration of indexes to externalresources is a starting step.andP;  Multimedia computing is not a universalchannel for storing and communicating information, much as we might like itto be.andM;Standard index file format neededandM;Standards are essential for such a plan to succeed.andP;  Obviously, libraries andsoftware developers would have to agree on a file format for indexinformation.andP;  We need a standard resource file format that allow holders oflibrary resources, such as books, magazines, videotapes and so forth, to&quot;publish&quot; their indexes.andM;Indexes of all kinds already exist, and we don't think it's necessary, atthis point, to try to reinvent them.andP;  All that's necessary is a way topresent raw data to software applications, which can then do whatever fancydata manipulation that might be necessary.andM;This way, the personal computer can become more personalized -- each user canincorporate index information as he or she prefers.andM;We're really talking about a fundamental market force in the 1990s --information overload.andP;  We don't need more encyclopedias, we need better ones.andM;There's already a candidate for a standard file format for library cataloginformation, called MARC, for &quot;MAchine Readable Cataloging,&quot; developed andpromoted by the U.S.andP;  Library of Congress.andP;  Several companies already developcomputer-based catalogs as a service to libraries.andP;  We talked to RushBrandis, who is with Western Library Network, which publishes a three CD-ROMdisc catalog to more than 300 libraries in five western states.andM;Western Library Network's product can export data in the MARC format, so thatlibraries can easily add data from the CD-ROMs to their in-house catalogs.andM;The size of the catalogs is a problem that will have to be addressed.andO;Western Library Network's CD-ROMs use 2K bytes per record.andP;  A typical librarymight have 40,000 to 50,000 holdings -- which would result in an 80-100MBindex file, which would be practical only on CD-ROM.andP;  However, those indexesinclude a lot of information that's applicable only to librarians.andP;  Anend-user product might be much more compact.andM;California's experience with multimedia instructional resources shows thatjust adding multimedia isn't part of the solution, it's part of the problem,unless it's integrated with existing resources and helps manage them.andM;The way that encyclopedias and information resources of all kinds can be madebetter is to have a standard way to personalize them with tools that helpmanage existing information.andM;Inter-application communication, a feature that's going to become commonplacein operating systems in the next year, will allow programs to make use ofresources such as a software engine that &quot;reads&quot; standard index file format,further simplifying the task of integrating such information with existingapplications.andM;There are additional advantages to local storage of index information.andO;Indexes for information that's available on-line would save unnecessaryaccess time.andM;The press release floodandM;Let's take this idea one step further, not necessarily as a product proposal.andO;As an information-based company, we suffer from various information overloadproblems.andP;  A big one walks through the door each morning at about 10:30.andO;It's the mail.andP;  We receive a frightening stack of stuff, mostly pressreleases, each day.andM;Finding time to read and open all the mail can be a real problem.andP;  The biggerproblem is finding information later when we need it.andP;  Everything gets filed-- eventually -- but usually only by company name, not by subject.andP;  We reallyneed to be able to look up information by company, product name, productcategory and so forth.andP;  But the filing problem is too big.andP;  Just gettingthings filed by company name in a timely manner is a problem.andM;Here's how we might solve it, using the principal of the standard index fileformat.andP;  Each press release would have a bar code with the index informationon it.andP;  As we read the releases, we'd decide which ones need to be filed(yes, it's true, some don't make the cut at all -- they're the ones frommanufacturers of 30-button mice and other things we just don't ever care tohear about), scan the bar-coded index information into one of our computers,then file the papers in the simplest possible manner -- by the date they wereindexed, since the computer can record the date as it records the rest of theinformation.andM;Look at the advantages -- there's really no filing needed.andP;  The day's stackof papers just goes in a folder with the date on it.andP;  The computer does allof the sorting by company, etc., so that a person doesn't have to.andP;  Anordinary &quot;date received&quot; stamp can help avoid misfiling later.andP;  There's stillsome clerical work required -- scanning the bar codes, stamping the papersand putting them into a file -- but it's much, much less than accomplishingthe same by manual methods.andM;The resulting data, if it's in a standard index file format, can be used by aa variety of applications.andP;  A database might use address information to spotchanges and update itself, or a job change for an industry executive.andP;  Amarket research report might automatically add a pointer to a new product ina certain category.andM;This is not an essentially new idea.andP;  Videotape rental stores, for example,use bar coding to keep track of tapes as they come and go.andP;  Again, an exampleof an electronic index to external data resources.andM;The fundamental principal has to be applied in many way for multimediasystems to be truly valuable.andM;We like to say that the three big markets for multimedia are training,training and training.andP;  In search of an acronym, we also call this marketTraining, Instruction and Education (TIE).andP;  The TIE market, as illustrated bythe California example above, has a tremendous need to link multimedia TIEproducts to existing information resources, including workbooks and otherresource materials that reinforce or complement the information presented bythe computer.andM;Teaching people how to find information is one of the critical skills thatemployers frequently say is missing from recent graduates' skills.andO;Multimedia systems can't have the same failing.andM;Multimedia documents of all sorts will be far more useful if they'reexpandable, in a standard, open architecture, to include references to avariety of external materials.andM;If we wait until everything is available in a digital form, we'll be missingmany, many market opportunities.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
