Stocks on the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores rose 103% lastyear in U.S. dollar terms, by one measure, and have soaredsixteenfold since 1984; the market is up 13% so far in 1992.By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen2.6% this year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are still attractive situations in Mexico, but itis a time for caution,&quot; warns Douglas A. Campbell, presidentof D.A. Campbell Co., a Santa Monica, Calif., brokerspecializing in Latin American stocks. He adds: &quot;You couldbuy blind in the old days; you certainly can't buy blindnow.&quot;   He warns investors to be wary of stocks selling at pricesthat are inordinately high compared with earnings and of &quot;newdeals where earnings haven't materialized yet.&quot; One suchexample, Mr. Campbell says, is Grupo Televisa S.A., atelevision and production company that owns the world'slargest Hispanic network.   Not in this category, he says, is Telefonos de MexicoS.A., the national telephone company that is Mexico's largestcompany and is selling at about 11 times 1992 projectedearnings. &quot;The stock is still reasonable compared with otherinternational telephone companies,&quot; says Mr. Campbell, whoadvises buying Telmex shares on price declines.   He also recommends companies that supplytelecommunications equipment and didn't participate in lastyear's bull run: Grupo Condumex S.A., Teleindustria EriccsonS.A., and Alcatel Indetel S.A. The last two are arecontrolled by their respective Swedish and French parentcompanies.   Jorge Mariscal, manager of Latin American equity researchat Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., sees the Bolsa appreciating 35% to45% in dollar terms this year. That's because he foresees20%-25% increases in inflation-adjusted corporate earnings, adrop in inflation to about 12% from 19%, and interest ratesfalling three to four percentage points. &quot;In general, themarket psychology should continue to improve,&quot; he says.   Indeed, Luis Maizel, president of LM Capital ManagementInc. in San Diego, says Mexico &quot;is one of the few economiesin the world growing steadily, has a stable government and ifthe FTA {Free Trade Agreement} passes, will grow further.&quot; Heforecasts 1992 Mexican growth at 4%.   Furthermore, Mr. Mariscal argues that with Mexican stockstrading at an average price of 15 times the past year'sper-share earnings, compared with 23 for Standard andamp; Poor's500-stock index, &quot;the Mexican market is still relativelyinexpensive.&quot; Using 1992 estimated earnings, the Bolsa iscurrently trading at a P/E of 11, he says.   Because solid economic growth is expected, Manuel GonzalezSordo, manager of the Emerging Mexico Fund in Mexico City,likes Cementos Mexicanos S.A. (Cemex) and Tolmex S.A. -- twocement companies -- and Transportacion Maritima MexicanaS.A., a shipping company that he says controls roughly 70% ofshipping by sea going in and out of Mexico.   Other favorites include Grupo Herdez S.A., a producer ofcanned foods with a strong distribution network, and GrupoCarso S.A., a &quot;conglomerate that is very well diversified intelecommunications {it owns a little over 5% of Telmex}, autoparts, retailing, food and beverages, tobacco andconstruction.&quot; It is also licensed to sell Philip Morris Co.cigarettes in Mexico, where the Marlboro brand is a statussymbol. One negative for Carso is that it is also in mining,an industry that the stock market has treated shabbily.   Mr. Maizel of LM Capital is big on Cemex and glassmakerVitro S.A. &quot;I like the big industrial companies that willtake advantage of the U.S. and Canadian market,&quot; says he.&quot;These companies have become very efficient. They have lowlabor costs and have acquired the mentality of exporters --high volume, low margins, good quality.&quot; If the Free TradeAgreement being negotiated between the U.S. and Mexico takeseffect, they will be even more competitive.   He also recommends paper company Kimberly-Clark de MexicoS.A. &quot;They have the quality standards to meet U.S. needs anda lower cost base&quot; than American competitors, Mr. Maizelsays.   He adds that two big national retailers worth looking atare Cifra S.A. and Grupo Gigante S.A.. Cifra is also inrestaurants and owns an up-scale garment chain. Despitewidescale poverty, Mexico's large population and growingeconomy still offer a large &quot;potential consumer market,&quot; hesays.   Other favorites include Grupo Financiero Banamex AccivalS.A. (Banacci S.A.), a universal bank formed by the merger ofa major broker with a newly privatized big commercial bank,and Grupo Financiero Obsa S.A., a top broker.   Money managers at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. agree with Messrs.Mariscal and Maizel's view of the Mexican economy. But theyare cautious on the stock market, largely because of the longrun-up.   &quot;At current prices, it's tough to make a valuation casefor Mexican stocks, but you can make a growth case, based onthe economy's strong potential,&quot; says Madhav Dhar, aportfolio manager and head of the emerging markets group forMorgan Stanley Asset Management.   Robert Meyer, a Morgan Stanley portfolio manager whospecializes in Latin American stocks, likes Banacci, Cemexand Tolmex. &quot;Economic growth in Mexico is going to be inroads, airports and housing. All that requires cement,&quot; hesays.   Another favorite is Grupo Situr S.A., a company thatdevelops tourist areas. Pointing out that Mexicans willvacation more as incomes rise, that U.S. interest in Mexicanvacations is still rising and that the Mexican governmentactively promotes tourism to gain hard currency, Mr. Meyersees Situr's income growing 35% annually in the next two tothree years.   Some money managers warn that a big correction in the U.S.stock market could trigger an equally big one in Mexico.That's because of the geographic proximity of the countries,the strong economic ties between them and the large amount ofU.S. investment in Mexico.   Two other risks are passage of the Free Trade Agreementbeing stalled in an election year -- an event that someMexican brokers predict could send the market skidding 30% --and Mexico's economic program going awry. This latterdevelopment could send foreign capital fleeing back home,which also would send the market tumbling.   &quot;Everything {in Mexico} is trading on expectations,&quot; warnsMr. Maizel of LM Capital. &quot;It's a very small market withenormous amounts of money chasing it. It's like a big roomwith a very small door. If everybody tries to get through thesmall door at the same time, there could be problems: Themarket could come down very fast.&quot;   ---                   Buying Mexican Stocks                                                                                                          -- Directly: Many Mexican companies issue three types ofstock: shares that can be owned only by Mexican nationals --to keep the company in local hands, shares that can be ownedby both Mexican and foreign investors, and shares that carrylimited or no voting rights.                                                                                                          -- American Depository Receipts: Can be bought through oneof several Mexican brokers in the U.S. or a majorinternational securities firm.
