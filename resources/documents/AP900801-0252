About 1,200 workers walked off the job Saturday at Quebec andOntario Paper Co. in Baie-Comeau, Que., while 420 workers struckThursday at James MacLaren Industries in Masson, Que., after thecompanies rejected a union request for 20 percent more vacation payand a reduction in work hours.   The two companies belong to the four-member Eastern CanadaNewsprint Group, which has bargained jointly for more than threedecades but has become splintered lately.   The two other companies in the 3,300-employee group _ DaishowaPaper Mfg. Co. Ltd. in Quebec City and Domtar Inc. in Dolbeau _have accepted the demands of locals of the Canadian PaperworkersUnion.   However, MacLaren has said it wants to bargain separately withits workers, while the union has said it will only bargain with thecompany as part of the group, MacLaren spokesman Normand Chenailsaid.   The unions are striking over local issues. Central bargaining bythe group was expected to begin later this month on the basis of amodel settlement reached by the union with another company,Stone-Consolidated Inc.   The agreement, which won only 56.4 percent approval from 2,300Stone workers in eastern Quebec, calls for annual wage increases of5.5 per cent over three years. I return, the union agreed to letmills operate on two holidays and allow repairmen perform a varietyof tasks on night shifts.   Many workers were angry that the contract broke little newground in areas including job security and overtime.   The two strike-bound companies and the union said they will payclose attention to what happens during negotiations involving 4,000workers at the larger Canadian Pacific Ltd., which begin this week.   Neither MacLaren, which produces 180,000 tons of newsprintannually, nor Quebec and Ontario Paper, which produces 450,000 tonsannually, said they have any stockpiles.   Both companies supply American newspapers, but it was notimmediately known what publications might be affected by thewalkout.</TEXT></DOC>
