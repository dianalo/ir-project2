The announcement by federal Senator Edmund Lopez, a member ofPresident Virgilio Barco's Liberal Party, came a day after leftistguerrillas released a former presidential candidate who waskidnapped May 29.   After his release, newspaper editor Alvaro Gomez Hurtado onThursday called for the government to hold peace talks with theleftist rebels, a controversial view in this country ripped byperiodic guerrilla attacks and one he previously did not seem toshare.   The April 19 Movement, also known as M-19, freed Gomez HurtadoWednesday night. M-19 is the most notorious of Colombia's fiveleftist guerrilla groups.   Gomez Hurtado, the Conservative Party candidate who lost the1986 presidential election, was kidnapped in a hail of submachinegun fire in Bogota.   In his presidential campaign and in editorials in El Siglo,Gomez had said that he was opposed to peace talks with guerrillasand that the army should wipe them out.   At his news conference Thursday, the 69-year-old journalist alsosaid the Colombian military should be given full support until thegovernment can negotiate with the rebels.   After his release, he indicated in a telephone interview withThe Associated Press on Wednesday night that he was not ruling outa peaceful solution to 30 years of civil strife that has taken morethan 20,000 lives.   ``The episode of my kidnapping has confirmed that we are livingin difficult times and that it is necessary to seek nationalreconciliation,'' he said.   The upcoming peace talks, scheduled for July 29 in Bogota,sprang from negotiations in Panama toward Gomez Hurtado's release.M-19 guerrilla leaders met there with Roman Catholic Churchintermediaries and members of Gomez Hurtado's party.   The government refused to send a representative there andrejected an M-19 demand that the Colombian government promise toreopen peace talks with them before Gomez Hurtado's release.   The M-19 freed him anyway.   The army has said repeatedly it opposes talks with the rebels.But military leaders say they will abide by the government'sdecision.   Former President Julio Cesar Turbay, also of Barco's LiberalParty, indicated Thursday that the government is undecided.   ``It is very difficult for me ... to say what should be done,''Turbay told the Bogota radio station Caracol.   During his 1978-1982 presidency, Turbay ordered the military todestroy the guerrillas.   The military and many businessmen, church leaders andcongressmen have said that 1982 peace negotiations, started by thenPresident Belisario Betancur, failed. They argue a cease-fire gavethe guerrillas time to build up their military forces.   Betancur, interviewed Thursday by Caracol, said he favors newnegotiations. ``Dialogue is necessary now more than ever,'' he said.   Since the collapse of the cease-fire, Colombia's guerrillas havelaunched their strongest attacks ever in Colombia.   They have raided towns, blown up bridges and electricity towers,ambushed army patrols and bombed the government's main oil pipeline.   The most brazen and bloodiest guerrilla operation was the M-19'sseizure of the federal Palace of Justice in Bogota on Nov. 7, 1985.   The palace was destroyed by fire and 115 persons, including 11Supreme Court magistrates, were killed.   An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 guerrillas operate in Colombia.</TEXT></DOC>
