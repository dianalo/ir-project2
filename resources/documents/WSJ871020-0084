The National Aeronautics and Space Administration acted on behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is part of the Commerce Department, in buying the launch services.    Before the Challenger accident in January 1986, the space agency bought expendable rockets from manufacturers and launched satellites itself. But after the shuttle disaster, the administration directed NASA to encourage the development of a U.S. launch industry by using private companies to launch government satellites whenever possible.    The contract for the launches will be awarded to St. Louis-based General Dynamics' space systems division when final negotiations are concluded. The company plans to use Atlas Centaur rockets to launch the satellites, which help forecast major storms.    Under the contract, General Dynamics will provide services for satellites to be launched in March 1990, December 1990 and May 1992. NASA will have the option of contracting for the launching of two more satellites later. The company said the cost will be about $315 million if it handles all five launches. </TEXT></DOC>
