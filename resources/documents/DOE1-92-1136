<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-1136 </DOCNO><TEXT>To study the quality of early research on the clinical efficacy of diagnosticimaging with magnetic resonance, they assessed 54 evaluations publishedin the first four years after introduction of this modality using tencommonly accepted criteria of research methodology. The terms sensitivity,specificity, false-positive or false-negative, accuracy, and predictivevalues were used infrequently. 19% of the evaluations used three termsappropriately, 48% used one or two terms, and 33% used none. Data werepresented appropriately for one or more of the five terms in 59% of evaluations.A gold standard comparison with the results of an independent procedure,such as surgical or autopsy findings, was presented in 22% of evaluations.Results of another imaging procedure were described in 63% of evaluations.Only one evaluation clearly described a prospective study design, although11 evaluations apparently were planned in advance. Not one evaluationcontained an appropriate statistical analysis of the distributions ofquantitative readings, blinded image readers to diagnosis or other testresults, measured observer error, or randomized the order of magneticresonance imaging and other imaging procedures. The authors concludesthat health care professionals paying for expensive innovative diagnostictechnology should demand better research on diagnostic efficacy.</TEXT></DOC>
