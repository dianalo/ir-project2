The Louisville, Colo.-based maker of data storage devices said the 8380P, priced at $65,000, is about 17% faster than similar products made by Storage Technology and other manufacturers. The system holds 2.5 billion bytes of information, or about 1.25 million double-spaced typewritten pages. The product will be available in the fourth quarter, Storage Technology said.    The 8380R, priced at $360,000 and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 1988, stores as much as 20 billion bytes, or about 10 million pages. Storage Technology said the 8380R is designed to save 50% of the floor space taken up by other systems with a similar memory size.    A spokesman for Storage Technology wouldn't comment on any orders the company might already have for the products or how much the systems are expected to add to revenue. </TEXT></DOC>
