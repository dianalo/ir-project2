(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michigan women with unwanted pregnanciesand little money began to search for alternatives to state-paidabortions Monday as a voter-approved ban on Medicaid funding for theprocedure took effect.   Health clinics offered discounts and no-interest loans to womenunable to pay the usual abortion charge of about $250, but officialssaid they won't be able to cover all of the $6 million the state hadbeen spending on about 18,500 Medicaid abortions a year.   ``We'll be turning away some people, and we think that's reallyunfortunate,'' said Margy Long, public affairs specialist at the AnnArbor-based Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan.   Proponents of the law said that those who believe abortion ismurder shouldn't be forced to subsidize abortions through their taxpayments, and expressed hope that it would forestall some abortions.   The Planned Parenthood affiliate is one of several offeringfinancial aid to women seeking abortions. Long said PlannedParenthood will charge low-income women $195, the same amountMedicaid paid and about $70 less than what women with insurance arecharged.   No-interest loans will be available for those who can't come upwith that much, she said.   The Reproductive Health Care Center-Planned Parenthood ofKalamazoo has raised nearly $50,000 for its emergency loan program,said Louise Safron, executive director.   ``We figure it needs to be $100,000 or more,'' she said.   But Safron said even at that level, not all women will be able toobtain abortions.   ``I can only go back to my experience in Ohio when it de-fundedwomen covered by Medicaid. About 90 percent sought and receivedabortions and 10 percent gave up trying to find the money andcontinued their pregnancies. We'll have to wait and see what happensin this state,'' she said.   The end to Medicaid abortions came 10 days after the Board ofState Canvassers officially certified the Nov. 8 vote by whichMichigan citizens decided, 57 percent to 43 percent, to stop thestate funding.   More than 450,000 Medicaid recipients were notified by mail thatabortions would no longer be paid for beginning Monday, said BobHarris, spokesman for the Department of Social Services.   Carmen Franco, administrator of the 15 Womancare clinics inMichigan which perform a large share of the state's abortions, saidnot all women may have realized the cutoff was taking effect.   Some of those who did rushed to have the procedure done lastweek, resulting in a patient load on Saturday nearly double theusual, she said.   ``It's quiet today because of all the rush through last week.We'll see by the end of the week how many people really heard whatwas going on,'' she said.   By midday Monday, no one had sought to take advantage of theclinics' cut-rate of $50 for Medicaid women, she said. Women withprivate insurance or who pay cash are charged $225.   Franco said the $50 fee probably will still be too much for somewomen.   ``It's those you worry about. They may get desperate and trysomething foolish and then you have a hospital case. In the worstcase, they die,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
