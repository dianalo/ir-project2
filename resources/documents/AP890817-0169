For example, some chemicals are banned entirely by federalregulations from the nation's food supply because they have beenshown to cause cancer, genetic deformities or other health problems.   Other chemicals, synthetic or natural, are prohibited if their``residues'' in food exceed certain ``tolerance'' levels. Thesetolerances depend on the chemicals involved and how they measure upto federal criteria.   Chemical residues in food cover a wide range of items, includingfruits, vegetables, meat, milk, poultry and eggs. And they alsoinvolve residues from man-made chemicals such as DDT (banned yearsago) and naturally occurring substances such aflatoxin.   One of the major sources of food contamination is the array ofpesticides used on crops to control insect pests, plant diseases andweeds. It's a problem for both domestic producers and foreigngrowers who ship produce to the U.S. market.   Two Agriculture Department economists, Catherine Greene and GlennZepp, say that American consumers are eating more fruits andvegetables _ and are getting more persnickety about the healtheffects of chemical residues on produce.   Greene and Zepp, writing in the National Food Review, a quarterlyUSDA magazine, noted 1988 industry figures showing that nearly 18percent of consumers polled said they were concerned enough by thepossible effects of residues to change their buying habits.   The survey, conducted by The Packer, a produce industry magazine,showed that another 64 percent were concerned but had not alteredtheir buying habits. Only about 19 percent said they were not veryworried.   According to Greene and Zepp, consumers ``may be wary of theeffectiveness of current food safety regulations.''   For example, they said in their report, when small groups ofRedbook magazine readers were asked about food safety, only 7percent of those who replied said they trusted current laws toguarantee a safe food supply. Seventy percent said they did not.   ``Few consumers appreciate the scope of the U.S. food regulatorysystem _ the inspection and testing procedures for monitoring foodproduction, processing and marketing, which has generally givenAmericans a safe food supply,'' the report said. ``Also new stepsare being taken to improve monitoring a fill the gaps in pesticideregulation.''   Although more than a dozen federal agencies have a hand in theregulation of produce quality, safety, appearance, freshness,labeling, marketing and imports, only two are involved in pesticideenforcement.   The Environmental Protection Agency determines which pesticidesmay be registered for use on food crops. The EPA also setstolerances for those chemicals in fruits, vegetables and other foodsfor human consumption.   Food and Drug Administration officials monitor and enforce thepesticide tolerances set by EPA on both domestic and importedproducts.   The Agriculture Department has charge of the inspection of meatand poultry and processed food items containing those products.   Greene and Zepp noted that Congress last year amended the FederalInsecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, which requires thatpesticides be registered with EPA for legal use on food crops.   The amendments include a 1997 deadline for testing,re-registration and possible cancellation of older chemicals, and afaster track for registering new chemicals.   One of the basic problems in the government's registrationprocess for pesticides used on food crops has been the rapid growthin the consumption of some fruits and vegetables.   In other words, chemical tolerance set years ago were basedpartly on lower consumption rates of certain food items. That raisesthe possibility that residue intake by consumers is understated.   ``For example,'' the report said, ``average consumption of freshhoneydew, broccoli and tomatoes increased from 1.1, 1.1 and 12.6pounds per person, respectively, in 1976 to 2.4, 3.3 and 16.8 poundsin 1987.   ``Some of the pesticides used on these vegetables were registeredprior to these consumption gains.''   The report added that certain age groups eat larger amounts ofsome fruits and vegetables than the average on which the residueintake is estimated _ which also could cause residue intake beingunderstated.   Another flaw is that EPA's tolerance-setting system ``does notconsider the health effects of consuming several pesticidessimultaneously, which may or may not be greather than the sum of therisks from exposure to the residues individually,'' the report said.   Legislative pressure continues to build on Capitol Hill to banunsafe pesticides and strengthen EPA's tolerance procedures.   Among the measures are food safety amendments introduced by Sen.Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., whichwould require EPA to establish residue tolerances for differentpopulation groups, such as infants and children.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 20</NOTE></DOC>
