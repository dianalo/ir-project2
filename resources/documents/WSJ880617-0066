Republicans are confident they can capitalize on House Speaker Wright's problems. Bush is expected to start mentioning Wright frequently. Says one GOP activist: &quot;Just talking about Jim Wright neutralizes&quot; ethics questions raised about Meese. The GOP also will seek to exploit the legal troubles of such House Democrats as New York's Biaggi and Tennessee's Ford.    Democrats will counterattack against Meese. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that 42% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Meese, while 19% have a favorable view. And his resignation is favored by a 42%-30% margin. Analysts doubt the Wright flap will hurt Dukakis, who yesterday supported the idea of a special counsel to investigate charges against the speaker.    Some Democrats worry about Wright's high visibility as chairman of the party's convention next month, but he isn't likely to relinquish the post.    ECONOMIC GROWTH will be stronger than expected but won't dent the deficit.    First-quarter gains prompt private economists to raise their forecasts for the year closer to 3% growth. The White House, which had predicted 2.4% growth, also has decided to raise its forecast in its coming mid-year budget review. Rising exports are a significant factor in the brightened outlook.    But higher-than-expected interest rates and costly bank bailouts will increase outlays, adding to the deficit. Budget chief Miller repeatedly warns of a fiscal 1989 deficit projection that exceeds the Gramm-Rudman target and triggers automatic spending cuts this fall. Other officials say the White House will massage its numbers to avoid an election-year budget crisis.    BUSH IS WARY about embracing the Reagan-Gorbachev euphoria.    The vice president distances himself from Reagan's claim of a new era in U.S.Soviet relations. Politics is one motivation. Bush's skepticism helps him woo staunch conservatives, with whom he has been feuding. Portraying Soviet relations as a continuing concern also enables him to play up his foreign-policy experience against Dukakis.    Bush has doubts about whether Gorbachev really has brought a lasting change in Soviet behavior. Aides say he is influenced by his time as an ambassador in China, when he witnessed a revolutionary opening to the West. He questions &quot;whether the change is as fundamental as he saw in China,&quot; one adviser says. &quot;The answer is he's not sure yet.&quot;    Both Bush and Dukakis will call for more improvements in Soviet human rights.    KEYNOTE STRATEGY: Though New Jersey Sen. Bradley is a front-runner to be the keynote speaker at the Democratic convention, top Democrats mull an alternative plan: If Dukakis first picks a running mate who wins Jackson's approval, then Jackson would give the keynote speech. Others lean toward a woman or a Southerner.    REAGAN'S RATINGS: In the new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 49% approve of Reagan's performance as president, while 38% disapprove. A plurality approves of his conduct in foreign affairs. But voters split almost evenly on his economic performance. They disapprove of the administration's handling of both the drug problem and, by a 2-to-1 margin, the Panama situation.    REAGAN'S VETO of the trade bill is disapproved of by more than two-thirds of voters surveyed in the Journal/NBC poll. Eight in 10 favor a law requiring 60 days' plant-closing notification, as in the bill. By a similar margin, voters would back a law requiring tougher presidential action against unfair trading partners.    FISHING FOR AN ISSUE, the media man for Minnesota Democratic Senate challenger Hubert Humphrey III gets a plastic piranha to use as a prop in campaign TV ads. Incumbent Sen. David Durenberger in past years reaped $100,000 in royalties for books published by Piranha Press that sold 8,000 copies, mostly to lobbyists.    TENSIONS SIMMER beneath the harmony of the Toronto economic summit.    Reagan and the six other leaders at the summit will have to paper over some key disputes. The U.S.-European fight over agriculture trade is getting harsher; Common Market officials hold a trans-Atlantic video briefing for U.S. reporters to challenge U.S. subsidies. West Germany worries U.S. budget deficits are too large; Washington thinks Bonn does too little to spur growth.    White House aides expect Japan, Britain and other nations to endorse Reagan's call for more aid to the Philippines. But the plan still faces several hitches. Meantime, all of the allies are unhappy with talk of reviving the U.S. trade bill. Reagan's advisers scramble to brief the president for a planned freewheeling discussion of long-range problems.    Among possible tricky topics: future demographic trends and international cooperation on new genetic research.    MINOR MEMOS: Star-struck: Nancy Reagan's approval rating in the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll is eight points lower among people who don't read their horoscopes than among those who do. . . . The Dukakis campaign dubs its plane &quot;the Duke Skywalker.&quot; . . . Returning the favor: Bork makes a personal appearance and signs a fund-raising letter to help re-elect Utah Sen. Hatch, Bork's chief ally in his failed Supreme Court nomination fight. </TEXT></DOC>
