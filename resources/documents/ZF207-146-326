commercials have brought home just how clear, crispand clean a conversation can sound over their fiber-optic lines.andM;Unfortunately, what we've gained in long distance, we've lost at the locallevel.andP;  Deregulation has entitled telcos to unprecedented rate hikes forlocal calls and services.andP;  Businesses, like most households, have experienceda painful swelling of their basic-rate bills.andM;To top it off, these rate increases have not been accompanied by substantialimprovements in the local loop from your home or office to the CO.andO;Copper-wirig routes remain the order of the day.andP;  And it appears localcarriers have little or no intention of replacing them with the costlyfiber-optic stuff we've come to know and crave so badly.andM;What we're getting at is this: In the absence of competition, local telcoshave done little to improve the quality of their networks, while making sureyou pay through the nose for the privilege of using them.andM;Well, real competition at the local level has just arrived.andP;  A host of newcompanies are installing bypass networks for major-urban markets.andP;  Thesenetworks present clients with an alternative means of transmitting andreceiving from both their central office Point-Of-Presence to their officeand between two sites in a private-network setup.andM;In November of 1988, the FCC tipped its hat to bypass networks by assigningthem a catchy name -- Metropolitan Area Networks or MANs.andP;  Extensive MANshave been put in place by such budding young companies as FiberLAN (indowntown Houston) and International Computer Corporation (Falls Church, VA,serving the greater Washington, DC, area).andM;A Working DefinitionandM;Of MANsandM;MANs are city-wide fiber-optic networks which transmit voice/data signalsamong any number of pre-selected locations.andP;  Although they generally do notstretch to the outer reaches of the corresponding BOC's jurisdiction, thesealternative networks are already equipped to handle traffic through citycenters and significant outlying areas.andM;Fiber-optic MANs, as you might imagine, work somewhat like LANs.andP;  Instead ofdirecting all calls to a central office equivalent, the MAN links two or morelocations with wholly dedicated lines.andM;For a fixed monthly charge, MAN customers lease bandwidth, a predeterminednumber of DS-1, DS-3 or voice-grade circuits to hook up locations of theirown choosing.andP;  Under the agreement, the customer can transmit an unlimitedamount of traffic -- day or night, voice or data.andM;Rates are, of course, distance-sensitive.andP;  A connection between two buildingsa block a way will cost less than two buildings five miles apart.andM;Major ApplicationsandM;Common sense dictates you're not going to lease a month's worth of MANbandwidth for a direct link to some location you call only a few times a day,like your pizza parlor or corner barber shop.andP;  Only a fairly frequentexchange of traffic between two locations will justify use of a whollydedicated line.andM;Bearing that in mind, we present you with today's three most popularapplications for MANs:andM;1.andP;  Customer to Customer.andP;  The MAN links together multiple-customer branchesin an urban area.andP;  In Washington, DC, for example, ICC connects severalremote agencies of the federal government.andM;2.andP;  Customer to Carrier.andP;  This applications furnishes the customer withdirect access to his long-distance carrier, or to his T-1 ordigital-microwave facilities.andM;3.andP;  Carrier Points Of Presence.andP;  Sprint, MCI and other carriers are startingto look at the option of leasing lines from MAN companies as an alternativeto laying down their own costly routes through the heart of big cities.andM;The Sales Pitch For MANsandM;Don Hutchins, President and CEO of ICC, can furnish you with a host ofreasons for using his fiber-optic network in the greater DC area.andP;  Firstamong his selling points is quality.andP;  The fiber-optic fidelity of Sprint etal.andP;  can be severely marred by the antiquated copper of the local telco.andO;With ICC's fiber-optic bypasses between customer and carrier, this fidelityis preserved on the local leg of each call's journey.andM;Equally important for many of ICC's customers is the security issue.andP;  As anyfaithful TELECONNECT reader knows, phone bugging has reached epidemicproportions.andP;  The telco's standard network -- constructed out of copper cableand perched upon easily accessible telephone poles -- are easy prey for thewiretapper.andM;Conversely, bypass networks are a lot less susceptible to espionage.andP;  Thelight source traveling within a glass fiber is virtually un-tappable by eventhe most contemporary of methods.andP;  And since ICC's network, like most otherMANs, is contained in conduit 12 feet below street level, the technologicalbarriers against bugging are buttressed by obvious physical ones.andM;Should it come as any surprise, then, that ICC's network runs past 1600Pennsylvania Avenue?andP;  ICC does admit to having certain federal agencies asclients, but -- haven't we heard this before? -- national security prohibitsthem from telling which ones.andM;Secondary considerations for using MANs include risk avoidance.andM;In the event of disaster, many businesses are hedging their bets by employingmultiple carriers at the local level.andP;  This way, should either their MAN orthe local-telco system somehow malfunction, they can use the one system whileawaiting repairs on the other.andM;Mr.andP;  Hutchins' list goes on and on.andP;  Surprisingly, way at the bottom is theprice factor.andP;  Most MAN companies offer an economic incentive by offeringservices at a rate somewhat lower than the local telcos, if your monthlytraffic tops a given threshold.andP;  However, the bulk of their client companiesare sold largely on quality and security considerations, rather than onprice.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
