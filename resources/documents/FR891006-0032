A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Calgene, Inc., of Davis, California, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment, to field test tobacco plants geneticallyengineered to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate. The field trial will takeplace in Yolo County, California.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Calgene, Inc., application. APHIS concluded that the fieldtesting will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Calgene, Inc., as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding a modified 5-enolpruvyla-3-phosphoshikimate synthasewhich is not inhibited by the herbicide glyphosate has been inserted intoa tobacco chromosome. In nature, chromosomal genetic material of theseplants can only be transfered to other sexually compatible plants by cross-pollination.In this field trial, the introduced gene cannot spread to other plantsby cross-pollination because the field test plot is sufficiently distantfrom any sexually compatible plants susceptible to cross-pollination. Inaddition, no tobacco plant material will be allowed to survive.2. Neither the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase gene itself, notits gene product, confer on tobacco any plant pest characteristic. Traitsthat lead to weediness in plants are polygenic traits and cannot be conferredby adding a single gene.3. The microorganism from which the 5-enoloyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthasegene was isolated is not a plant pest.4. The 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase gene does not providethe transformed tobacco plants with any measurable selective advantageover nontransformed tobacco in the environment in this field test.5. Select noncoding regulatory regions derived from plant pests have beenincorporated into the chromosomal DNA but do not confer on tobacco anyplant pest characteristics.6. The vector used to transfer the 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthasegene to tobacco plants has been evaluted for its use in this this specificexperiment and does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. Thevector, although derived from a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential,has been disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for producing plantdisease have been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested andshown to be nonpathogenic to plants.7. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliver the vectorDNA and 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate synthase gene into the plant cell,has been shown to be eliminated and no longer associated with the transformedtobacco plants.8. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).The vector does not survive in the plants.9. Glyphosate is one of the herbicides that is rapidly degraded in theenvironment. It has been shown to be less toxic to animals than many herbicidescommonly used.10. The field test site is small (99,825 square feet).The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 3rd day of October 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
