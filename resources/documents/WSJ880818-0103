International arms trading reached $35 billion last year, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in its 1988 report.    It said $24.7 billion of weapons were delivered to Third World countries. India was the world's largest buyer, at $5.2 billion.    The U.S., Soviet Union, France, Britain and China supplied 80% of the international market, according to the report, written by Aaron Karp, a researcher at the institute.    The report also said that Iran and Iraq have spent about $200 billion to fight their eight-year-old war, about half their total earnings from oil. It said the war, which resulted in an estimated 1.5 million casualties, &quot;has become the most destructive conflict ever fought between two Third World countries.&quot;    The institute, an independent group funded mostly by the Swedish Parliament, monitors world-wide developments in weapons and arms control.    Its 600-page annual report said that the $35 billion total of arms delivered last year represented a $2.8 billion increase and was the highest in six years. It attributed the increase to U.S. and Soviet supplies of jet fighters ordered in the early 1980s.    But it said that developing countries are reducing their dependency on the superpowers for weaponry, buying less and varying their sources, and that military hardware isn't the foreign-policy tool it was in the 1960s and 1970s.    Developing countries, it said, cannot afford U.S.-built weapons systems, don't want inferior Soviet-built equipment, and are turning to other manufacturers.    The report stated that if the wars in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf end, &quot;The trade in major weapons could drop precipitously.&quot;    Last year, the Iran-Iraq war dominated the arms trade and spawned a thriving black market, according to the report. It said that Iraq spent $11.1 billion to $13.2 billion on its war efforts, or nearly 30% of its gross national product. Iran spent an estimated $8.8 billion to $10.7 billion on the war annually, or about 5% to 6% of its GNP, the report said.    &quot;Virtually all Western nations found themselves embroiled in controversies over illegal arms sales,&quot; the report said. A &quot;gray market&quot; of officially approved covert sales was thought to be valued at $2 billion last year, it said.    Illegal or covert sales to Iran in the past few years, the report said, included anti-tank missiles and Hawk anti-aircraft missiles from the U.S., explosives and speedboats from Sweden, artillery shells from France, and Czech AK-47 assault rifles.    Government-to-government sales dominated the arms market, with more deals involving licensing agreements, technology transfers, and the modernization of outdated systems.    The arms business &quot;is becoming less tidy,&quot; the report said. &quot;It has diversified into many new forms, making the trade less predictable and harder to evaluate.&quot;    The institute also reported that:   --At the end of last year, 36 major wars were in progress, as defined by more than 1,000 fatalities.    --The Soviet Union and U.S. deployed a total of 1,250 new long-range missiles last year. Britain and France moved toward jointly producing a new missile, and China continued its military modernization.    --The five countries that admit they have nuclear arms conducted test explosions last year at an average rate of one a week. The Soviets conducted 23 tests, the U.S. 14, France eight, and China and Britain one each.    --A reexamination of seismic data showed that the U.S. conducted dozens of unannounced tests from 1963 to 1986.    --Last year, 85 satellites were launched with military functions, or about 75% of all satellites put into orbit. The Soviet Union reported four launch failures, compared with two for the U.S., and three other Soviet satellites malfunctioned. </TEXT></DOC>
