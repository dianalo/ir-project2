<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-0964 </DOCNO><TEXT>X-ray diffraction analysis of the compound in the title has been carriedout ({lambda}o, 4980 reflections, R=0.056). The crystas are monoclinic:a=13.196(8), b=14.08(4), c=17.86(2)A, {gamma}=98.5(1), Z=4, sp.gr. P2/sub1//n. The molecule presents rhenium octahedral complex, in which 3.5-di-tret,butyl-benzo-1,2-semiquinone ligand and two carbonyl groups are locatedin equatorial, positions while the third carbonyl group and triphenylphosphineare in axial ones. Re-O bond lengths are 2.13 and 2.16A, those of C-Cand C-O in chelate ring are 1.49 and 1.27; 1.31 A respectively. Averagevalues of Re-C and C-O bond lengths in carbonyl groups are 1.90 and 1.18A, Re-P bond length is 2.493 A.</TEXT></DOC>
