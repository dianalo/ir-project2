The Time Inc. magazine also said that, for the second year in a row, it won't increase its advertising rates in 1989; a full, four-color page in the magazine costs about $120,000. However, ad industry executives said that because of the lower circulation, ad rates will be effectively about 6% higher per subscriber. That increase falls into the 5% to 7% range that industry executives expect most magazines to ask for in 1989.    The cut in guaranteed circulation reflects Time's difficulty in constantly keeping its circulation buoyed at 4.6 million. The vast majority of its subscribers already receive either a premium or a discount for signing on -- a process that is extremely expensive. The magazine will no longer pour so much money into &quot;our most marginal subscribers, the subscribers who have the highest acquisition costs,&quot; said Robert Miller, the magazine's publisher.    Advertisers generally lauded Time's moves. &quot;It says that they are coming to the realization that you don't keep driving up the numbers at any cost, and that there are certain parts of the circulation that aren't worth pursuing,&quot; said Joseph Ostrow, world-wide media director for ad agency Foote, Cone andamp; Belding Communications Inc. &quot;I think that's a healthy sign.&quot;    Leo Scullin, a senior vice president of ad agency Young andamp; Rubicam Inc., said, &quot;If they're bad customers for Time, they're bad customers for us, and that's good to get rid of them.&quot;    But some competitors saw Time's move as betraying a weakness in the editorial product, and speculated that it might be only a first step in a further erosion of readers. &quot;There are so many premiums and so much discounting. The editorial product isn't holding the audience,&quot; said Fred Drasner, president and chief executive officer of U.S. News andamp; World Report. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, in the first half of the year, about 14% of U.S. News's new subscribers received discounts; for Time, that figure for the first half of 1987 (1988 statistics aren't yet available) was 82%.    Even after cutting its circulation rate base, Time remains far larger than its competitors. Newsweek guarantees advertisers 3.1 million circulation. Gerard Smith, vice chairman, says the magazine won't be affected by Time's move and has no plans to react to it. U.S. News guarantees advertisers 2.05 million circulation.    According to Time's Mr. Miller, the &quot;marginal&quot; subscribers the magazine plans to stop courting are also &quot;the less desirable demographic group&quot; -- industry jargon for lower-income people. He said Time has pinpointed certain undesirable geographic areas in which it won't attempt to sign up subscribers; he declined to identify those areas.    But ad executives were skeptical that the circulation Time loses will be undesirable, low-income people. &quot;It might well be other people who really don't want Time, and just can't resist the radios and telephones and everything else they're giving away,&quot; said Foote Cone's Mr. Ostrow.    Time's Mr. Miller also said he expects little, if any, impact on total readership of the magazine, and &quot;certainly&quot; no impact on &quot;the more attractive demographic segments.&quot; A number of magazines, including Readers Digest, have slashed their rate bases in recent years, and Mr. Miller said they had seen little effect on total readership.    Total readership is much higher than circulation because several people read magazine copies. Time's readership is estimated at 23.5 million because every copy is read by an average 4.78 people, according to Simmons Market Research Bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
