(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   At least two of this tobacco market center's five city directors are reconsidering their support of a smoking ban after objections from a local tobacco company.    A policy banning smoking in the main lobby of City Hall, City Commission chambers, the city bus station and several other places took effect Wednesday over protests from Pinkerton Tobacco Co., Daviess County's largest industrial employer.    Owensboro is a major tobacco sales center for Kentucky. The Daviess County Farm Bureau estimates that area tobacco sales topped $25 million last year.    Pinkerton, in a letter dated May 20, notified Mayor David Adkisson that it will reconsider plans to expand in the county because of the ban.    &quot;If, as it appears, your recent enactment of a ban on our products is indicative of this community's attitude toward the tobacco industry, our company and our products, then the time has come for us to begin rethinking our plans for the future,&quot; Pinkerton wrote.    Pinkerton, which employs 504 people at its Daviess County plant, ranks itself as the nation's leading manufacturer of loose leaf and plug chewing tobaccos. It also makes smoking tobacco products.    The company said its letter doesn't mean it plans to withdraw from Daviess County. But Pinkerton said it is in the process of acquiring smoking tobacco brands from American Tobacco Co., Richmond, Va., and had planned to move to Owensboro manufacturing and distribution operations linked to that acquisition.    Mayor Adkisson said he didn't consider the letter a threat by the company to leave town, and he still supports the ban.    But Commissioner Jack Ross, who voted with the three other commissioners and the mayor to approve the policy, said Thursday the board overreacted. And Commissioner Waymond Morris said he &quot;probably will vote to rescind&quot; the policy, which &quot;is doing something we didn't intend to do:&quot; offending tobacco interests. </TEXT></DOC>
