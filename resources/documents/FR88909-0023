They required that revised State air quality implementationplans (SIPs) be prepared for all areas exceeding the national ambient airquality standards (NAAQSs). Section 176(a) of the CAA required that projectapprovals and grants authorized by the CAA and Title 23, U.S.C., be withheldfrom air quality control regions in which national primary ambient airquality standards had not been attained and where transportation controlmeasures (TCMs) were necessary to attain such standards if the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) Administrator found after July 1, 1979 (and afterJuly 1, 1982, in cases where an extension of the attainment deadline wasauthorized), that a Governor had not submitted a plan which consideredeach of the elements required by section 172 of the Act, or was not makingreasonable efforts to submit such a plan. The only exception to this Federalassistance limitation was that safety, mass transit and transportationimprovement projects related to air quality attainment or maintenance couldbe approved and funded.The 1977 CAA Amendments required attainment of the standards by eitherDecember 31, 1982, or December 31, 1987, depending upon whether an extensionwas granted. The CAA is silent as to what occurs thereafter. The EPA publisheda proposed policy entitled ``State Implementation Plans: Approval of Post-1987Ozone and Carbon Monoxide Plan Revisions for Areas not Attaining the NationalAmbient Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs),'' on November 24, 1987, (52 FR45044). In it, EPA indicated its view that highway sanctions under section176(a) would be available in the Post-1987 era.Congress addressed the December 31, 1987 deadline by imposing a moratoriumon all new sanctions until August 31, 1988. See the Mitchell-Conte amendmentto the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-202, (December 22,1987). This was done because the Congress has not yet reached agreementon amending the CAA. As part of the moratorium, Congress directed EPA tolist all areas which are not in attainment of the NAAQSs. In response tothis provisions, EPA issued a list of areas not now in attainment, togetherwith a discussion of alternative policy interpretations of the Mitchell-Conteamendment. In the policy discussion, EPA states that sanctions under section176(a) could be available for all Post-1987 nonattainment areas. The DOT does not agree with these EPA interpretations and has so indicatedto EPA. The DOT believes that the use of highway sanctions expired on December31, 1987, which was the final date included in the 1977 CAA Amendmentsfor demonstrating attainment of the NAAQSs. The matter is as yet unresolved.Congress has not passed legislation that reauthorizes the use of highwaysanctions, but both houses of Congress have introduced legislation to amendthe CAA that would include this reauthorization. None of these proposals,however, alter the categories of highway projects exempt from sanctionsestablished by the 1977 CAA Amendments. The DOT, therefore, requests publiccomments on its exemption process in the event that Congress reauthorizesthe use of highway sanctions. Section 176(c) of the CAA (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)) provides that ``(n)o department,agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government shall: (1) Engagein, (2) support in any way or provide financial assistance for, (3) licenseor permit, or (4) approve, any activity which does not conform to a planafter it has been approved or promulgated under section 110,'' and that``(n)o metropolitan planning organization * * * shall give its approvalto any project, program, or plan which does not conform to a plan approvedor promulgated under section 110.'' Section 176(d) of the CAA (42 U.S.C.7506(d)) requires that ``(e)ach department, agency, or instrumentalityof the Federal Government having authority to conduct or support any programwith air quality related transportation consequences shall give priorityin the exercise of such authority, consistent with statutory requirementsfor allocation among States and other jurisdictions, to the implementationof those portions of plans prepared under this section (110) to achieveand maintain the national primary ambient air quality standard.'' The DOT consulted with EPA to develop procedures for implementing sections176 (a), (c), and (d) of the CAA. As a result of this consultation, theDOT and EPA jointly issued a notice of final policy and procedures memorandum,dated April 10, 1980 (45 FR 24692), for meeting the Federal assistancelimitation in section 176(a) of the CAA. On January 26, 1981, FHWA andUMTA jointly issued interim final regulations (46 FR 8426) implementingthe conformity and priority requirements mandated by sections 176 (c) and(d) of the CAA. These conformity and priority regulations were based onan interagency agreement between DOT and EPA dated June 12, 1980. The DOT has determined that existing air quality regulations under section176 of the CAA should be simplified in order to achieve the administration'sstated goal of providing more flexibility to State and local agencies andreducing redtape whenever possible. The FHWA and UMTA are, therefore, proposingto consolidate DOT's responsibilities under section 176 of the CAA intoa single air quality regulation. The amended regulation proposes to consolidateand simplify: (1) The process of determining which highway projects areexempt from the Federal assistance limitations of section 176(a) of theCAA, and (2) the conformity and priority procedures contained in 23 CFRPart 770. The DOT has discussed this rulemaking effort with EPA. It is DOT's intent that all responsibilities of the DOT modal administrationseither stated or implied in sections 176 (a), (c), and (d) of the CAA bemet by the proposed regulation. Therefore, the following agreement andregulation are proposed to be superseded: (1) DOT/EPA Agreement on Procedures for Conformance of Transportation Plans,Programs, and Projects with Clean Air Act State Implementation Plans, datedJune 12, 1980. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Note: A copy of this agreement has been placed in the docket.) </ITAG>(2) FHWA/UMTA Air Quality Conformity and Priority Procedures for use inFederal-aid Highway and Federally Funded Transit Programs (published asan interim final rule) (46 FR 8426), dated January 26, 1981. With respect to the April 10, 1980, DOT/EPA <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice of Final Policy and Procedure on FederalAssistance Limitation required by section 176(a) of the Clean Air Act (45FR 24692), this proposed regulation would codify DOT's responsibilitiesand update its procedures for determining which projects are exempt fromthe Federal Assistance Limitations. The modified procedures are based onexperience gained over the past 8 years. Those parts of the April 10, 1980,<T4>Federal Register </T4>that cover EPA activities for imposing highwaysanctions are not changed by this proposed regulation. The FHWA further intends these procedures to meet its obligations under23 U.S.C. 109(j), which requires guidelines to assure that Federal andFederally assisted highway projects are consistent with approved SIP's.The previous guidelines were superseded by the procedures incorporatedin the interim final rule which amended 23 CFR Part 770 on January 26,1981. Separate project consistency determinations are not required to meetthe 23 U.S.C. 109(j) requirement. Only six comments were received in the public docket (FHWA Docket No. 80-18)in response to the January 26, 1981, interim final rule, four of whichwere from State departments of transportation, one from a local environmentalagency, and one from private industry. All but one of these commenterswere generally supportive of the provisions in the interim final rule.The one commenter that objected to the interim final rule indicated thatthe conformity and priority procedures would unnecessarily delay projectimplementation with no corresponding air quality benefits, and recommendedthat the procedures be abolished. Several suggestions were made to improvethe procedures and these are addressed in the Subpart B requirements thatfollow. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis </ITAG>It is proposed to amend the process of determining which highway projectsare exempt from the Federal assistance limitations of section 176(a) ofthe CAA and incorporate it into Subpart A of this regulation. These provisionsare currently contained in the DOT/EPA <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice of Final Policy and Procedures on FederalAssistance Limitation Required by section 176(a) of the CAA (45 FR 24692),dated April 10, 1980. It is further proposed to amend and incorporate the existing conformityand priority procedures (23 CFR Part 770) contained in the January 26,1981, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (46 FR 8426), into Subpart B of this regulation.<ITAG tagnum="85">Subpart A_Federal Highway Assistance Limitation </ITAG>Section 770.100_Purpose.This section states that the subpart is to set forth the policy and proceduresfor implementing the highway sanctions provisions contained in section176(a) of the CAA. This section is the same as that noted in the existingpolicy notice, with some minor editorial changes.Section 770.102_Definitions.This section defines the terms that apply to Subparts A and B. The definitionof the term ``Air Quality Control Region'' is proposed to be added. Definitionsfor the terms ``Annual (or biennial) element'' and ``Transportation improvementprogram (TIP)'' are also proposed to be added and are consistent with theFHWA and UMTA Urban Transportation Planning Regulation (23 CFR Part 450).The definitions for the terms ``National Ambient Air Quality Standards,''``Nonattainment Area,'' ``State Implementation Plan (SIP),'' and ``TransportationControl Measure (TCM)'' are identical to the definitions contained in thecurrent conformity and priority procedures (23 CFR Part 770). However,it is proposed to relocate them to Subpart A, since the terms are firstused in this subpart.Section 770.104_Policy.This section proposes to add a new policy statement. It states that itis FHWA policy to ensure that the requirements of section 176(a) of theCAA are met where the EPA Administrator makes a finding pursuant to section176(a) and limitations on Title 23, U.S.C., funds are applicable.Section 770.106_Applicability.This section is a restatement of section 176(a) of the CAA. It indicatesthat Federal assistance limitations apply in all nonattaiment areas whereTCM's are needed to attain primary air quality standards, when EPA findsthat the Governor has not submitted or is not making reasonable effortsto submit a SIP which considers each of the elements required by section172 of the CAA. It further states that the Federal assistance provisionsare not applicable to safety, mass transit, transportation improvementprojects related to air quality improvement, and transportation projectsadministered by UMTA under Title 49, U.S.C. Section 770.108_Federal Highway Assistance Limitation: Application.The procedures contained in this section, with regard to DOT's responsibilitiesafter sanctions are imposed, are the same as those contained in the April10, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, although some wording changes have beenmade to improve clarity. This section indicates that when EPA imposes highwaysanctions, the FHWA Division Administrator is prohibited from approvingany projects or awarding any grants, other than those exempt from the sanctionprovisions, in those areas contained in the EPA <T4>Federal Register</T4> sanctions notice. This section would also requirethe FHWA Division Administrator to provide the FHWA and EPA Regional Administratorswith information on those exempt projects advanced in areas under highwaysanctions. Procedures for this notification should be jointly negotiatedby FHWA Regional/Division Administrators and EPA.Language in the existing procedures describing EPA's actions for determiningwhen sanctions apply is not included, since only FHWA responsibilitiesare proposed to be codified in this regulation. Imposition of highway sanctionsis an EPA responsibility, and the procedrues for carrying out this responsibilitywhich are included in the April 10, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> are not affected by this proposed regulation.Section 770.110_Federal Highway Assistance Limitation: Removal. This section allows the FHWA Division Administrator to resume approvalof projects and grants, on the effective date of EPA's final notice whichis published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to lift highway sanctions in the area. This provisionis the same as current provisions in the April 10, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, but has been reworded for clarity.Section 770.112_Exemptions.This section proposes to identify the projects and categories of projectsthat are exempt from highway sanctions. These projects are the same asthose contained in the April 10, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice except as follows:<ITAG tagnum="81">Safety</ITAG>Railroad/highway crossings, pavement resurfacing and/or rehabilitationprojects, traffic control devices, lighting improvements, safety rest areas,and truck climbing lanes are proposed to be added to the list of safetyprojects that are exempt from highway sanctions. Typically, these projectsrequire little or no additional right-of-way and are cost-effective whenconstruction costs are compared to savings in accident costs. In addition,some FHWA and EPA Regional offices have already agreed to exempt thesetypes of safety projects under existing procedures through regional interagencyagreements. The addition of these types of safety projects would providefor a more uniform application of this provision and simplify the processof exempting these types of projects in areas where sanctions are proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mass Transit</ITAG>Carpool/vanpool programs are proposed to be added to the mass transit projectsthat are exempt from highway sanctions, since these programs are beneficalto air quality in that they increase vehicle occupancy, reduce congestion,reduce time delays, and contribue to a more efficient use of the existingtransportation system.<ITAG tagnum="81">Air Quality Improvement Projects</ITAG>Bicycle lanes, bicycle/pedestrian facilities, and projects for which anair quality analysis indicates an improvement over the no-build alternativesare proposed to be added to this category. The FHWA proposes to add theseadditional categories of projects to further streamline and simplify theexemptions process.By definition, air quality improvement projects provide for air qualitylevels in the near and long term that are better than those of the no-buildcondition. Therefore, certain projects may be identified as air qualityimprovement projects, provided that, an air quality analysis has been conductedthat takes into account projected traffic levels in the near and long term,it is documented in the project files, and it demonstrates that the microscaleCarbon Monoxide (CO) concentrations and the areawide Hydrocarbons (HC)emissions are less than the corresponding levels for the no-build conditionin the near and long term. The scope and complexity of this air qualityanalysis should be determined after consultation between Federal, State,and local transportation and air quality agencies, as appropriate, if fundinglimitations are imposed. The FHWA will issue a guidance document on a suggestedmethodology to evaluate highway air quality improvement projects in sanctionedareas.Sections 770.112(b) proposes to add a provision that would allow potentiallyexempt projects that do not clearly fall into one of the exemption categoriesin andSection; 770.112(a) to be submitted to the FHWA Regional Administratorfor final determination as to whether or not the project qualifies forexemption. Projects in this category need to be reviewed on a case-by-casebasis, and the Regional Administrator may require sufficient informationto determine if the project warrants an exemption under the highway sanctionsprovisions. For projects in this category, the FHWA Regional Administratorshould consult with the EPA Regional Administrator, as appropriate, beforemaking a final determination.Section 770.112(c) notes that any project which is exempt from highwaysanctions is still subject to the provisions of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. This requirement remains essentially unchanged from the April10, 1980, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice.<ITAG tagnum="85">23 CFR, Subpart B_Air Quality Conformity and Priority Procedures forUse in Federal-Aid Highway and Federally Funded Transit Programs</ITAG>Section770.200_Purpose.This section states that the purpose of this subpart is to set forth thepolicy and procedures for implementing the conformity and priority provisionsof the CAA and the consistency requirements of 23 U.S.C. 109(j). This sectionis unchanged from the existing regulation, except for the addition of thework ``policy.''Section 770.202_Definitions.The definition of the term ``metropolitan planning organization'' is proposedto be modified to make it consistent with the definition contained in FHWAand UMTA's Urban Transportation Planning Regulation (23 FR Part 450) whichwas issued in final form on June 30, 1983. The ``Categorical Exclusion''(CE) definition is based on that contained in FHWA and UMTA's EnvironmentalImpact and Related Procedures Regulation (23 CFR Part 771) and would relyon that regulation for the detailed description of activities identifiedas CEs. The definitions for the terms ``National ambient air quality standards,''``Nonattainment area,'' ``State implementation plan,'' and ``Transportationcontrol measure'' are proposed to be included in Subpart A of this regulationand are therefore deleted from this subpart.Section 770.204_Policy.This section states that it is the policy of FHWA and UMTA to satisfy theconformity and priority requirements of the CAA by consulting with Federal,State, amd local air pollution control agencies; ensuring that plans, programs,and projects conform with approved SIP's; and that priority is given toimplementing the TCM's in the SIP. This section is essentially the sameas contained in the current regulation.Section 770.206_Applicability.This section states that the conformity and priority procedures of thissubpart apply to activities in nonattainment areas, or portions thereof,and in air quality maintenance areas where State and local officials haveincluded in the SIP TCM's that are developed and implemented through theurban transportation planning process, in order to attain the primary nationalambient air quality standards. The applicability section is proposed tobe changed from the existing regulation so that it limits the conformityand priority requirements to those TCM's that are developed, programmed,and implemented as part of the urban transportation planning process. Thepurpose of this change is to eliminate general control programs such asinspection and maintenance (I/M), vapor emission control, fleet conversion,engine retrofit, etc., from FHWA and UMTA conformity determinations sincethese programs are not developed, funded, or implemented through the Federal-aidhighway or UMTA programs and therefore are not included in the urban transportationprocess. This change does not relieve a State of the responsibility toconsider and/or implement these general control programs as part of itsair quality attainment program. Rather the proposed rule serves to identifyfor State and local transportation agencies, those TCM's for which theymay have direct responsibility. It also states that the conformity provisionsapply to all construction activities funded with UMTA or FHWA funds. Inaddition, it points out that the conformity determination process describedunder this subpart satisfies the air quality consistency requirements of23 U.S.C. 109(j).Section 770.208_Conformity.Conformity between transportation plans, programs, and projects and theSIP is required by section 176(c) of the CAA (42 U.S.C., 7506(c)). TheUMTA and FHWA have an affirmative responsibility to assure the conformityof any activity they support, fund, or approve. Further, section 176(c)prohibits a metropolitan planning organization from giving its approvalto any project, program, or plan that does not conform to the SIP.This section proposes to update and condense information to reflect theprocedures and criteria used for making conformity determinations. In addition,it proposes to reflect changes made to the Urban Transportation Regulation(23 CFR Part 450). The State and metropolitan planning organization certification,which is developed pursuant to 23 CFR 450.114(c) and indicates that theurban planning process is being carried out in conformity with all applicablerequirements of section 174 and sections 176 (c) and (d) of the CAA, wouldbe the primary basis for the conformity finding.Conformity would be determined by FHWA and UMTA as part of each agency'sindependent TIP/annual (or biennial) element review conducted under 23CFR Part 450 and 49 CFR Part 613 of the urban planning process. The requirementin the existing regulation to make a conformity determination as part ofthe federal Certification process would be eliminated since the revisedUrban Transportation Planning Regulation (23 CFR Part 450) issued on June30, 1983, deleted the Federal Certification requirement. The basic philosophy of the conformity procedures is to compare transportationplans and programs with the air quality plans and programs which are includedin the SIP's. Coordination and consultation at the State and local levelsremain an essential part of the process. The FHWA and UMTA would determineconformance by comparing the transportation plan and TIP with the SIP toensure that transportation plans and programs contribute to reasonableprogress in implementing the TCM's in the SIP. This step is designed tomeet FHWA and UMTA's affirmative responsibilities under the CAA. Before making a final determination on the conformity of transportationplans and programs, FHWA and UMTA will coordinate with EPA as appropriate.Representatives of FHWA and UMTA are expected to meet with EPA and withaffected Federal, State and local jurisdictions and agencies, and metropolitanplanning organizations in an attempt to resolve problems which are discoveredduring the evaluation process. These discussions should focus upon remedialactions that would allow a conformity determination to be made. Once theevaluation process has been completed, including any necessary meetings,and UMTA and FHWA determine that an area's transportation plan or programdoes not conform to the SIP, transportation program approvals will be limitedin the affected area to preliminary engineering and environmental impactstudies; advance land acquisition for hardship and protective buying asdefined in 23 CFR 712.204(d) and advance land acquisitions under section3(b) of the UMTA Act which qualify for categorical exclusions under 23CFR Part 771; and those actions that are exempt from sanctions by andSection;770.112 in Subpart A of this proposed regulation. These provisions arebasically unchanged from the existing provisions, except the language regardinghardship acquisitions has been revised to make it consistent with 23 CFRPart 771. These funding limitations would remain in effect until the deficienciesare corrected and a finding of conformity is made. An individual transportation project is by definition in conformity ifany one of the following conditions exists: (1) The project is a TCM fromthe SIP, (2) the project comes from a conforming TIP, (3) the project isexempt from TIP requirements, or (4) it is processed as a ``categoricalexclusion'' pursuant to 23 CFR Part 771. These provisions are the sameas those in the existing regulation with the addition of categorical exclusions.This addition is proposed to simplify the conformity process for projectsthat by definition have no significant impact on the environment and thereforewould not adversely affect the TCM's in the SIP. It is the policy of FHWA and UMTA that compliance with project level environmentalrequirements should be undertaken and completed as part of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, and that the relevant environmentaldocuments should contain evidence of that compliance. This policy is setforth in the FHWA and UMTA regulation on Environmental Impact and RelatedProcedures set at 23 CFR Part 771. Consistent with this policy, FHWA and UMTA propose to change this sectionso that after approval of a final EIS or after a finding of no significantimpact (FONSI) is made under the Environmental Impact and Related Proceduresregulation, the project involved will not be subject to further conformityreview unless a supplemental EIS significantly related to air quality considerationsis undertaken. This proposal would eliminate existing complex requirementsto make further conformity reviews during a SIP revision, or when majorsteps toward implementation of the project (e.g., start of constructionor substantial right-of-way acquisition and relocation activities) havenot begun within 3 years of the date of approval of the final EIS. Theoriginal administrative procedures were developed in the belief that SIP'swould require frequent adjustments. Experience gained since then has notshown this to be the case, thus making the existing procedures dealingwith conformity during a SIP revision unnecessary. Further, the FHWA andUMTA are proposing this change because we believe that once a final EISor FONSI has been completed, the project should not be subject to furtherconformity determinations except when changes are proposed to a projectthat would result in a change in anticipated air quality impacts significantenough to warrant a supplemental EIS. The proposed change makes full andappropriate use of the environmental process, a process which FHWA andUMTA strongly support. This section also proposes to eliminate all non-regulatory guidance materialon EPA activities. This section would base conformity determinations onthe currently approved SIP until such time as a new SIP is approved. Plans,programs, and projects that conform to the current SIP would continue tobe authorized. The current provision that projects on a contingency listin the SIP be delayed for a 12-month period or until the SIP is formallyrevised, which ever is shorter, is proposed to be deleted. The FHWA andUMTA propose to delete this requirement because it is in conflict withEPA guidance contained in EPA's final policy for 1982 SIP's (46 FR 7182).This change does not affect the requirement for contingency provisionsas contained in EPA directives. Section 770.210_Priority. Section 176(d) of the CAA requires Federal agencies with authority to supportor fund transportation-related activities to give priority to implementingthe TCM's in the SIP's. In accordance with this section, a review of implementationprogress will be made by FHWA prior to approval of the Statewide Programof Projects required under 23 U.S.C. 105 and by UMTA as part of the TIP/annual(or biennial) element review process, to ensure the timely programmingand implementation of the TCM's in the SIP.Other priority provisions in the existing regulations are proposed to bedeleted since they deal solely with internal DOT/EPA interactions whichare inappropriate for retention in the regulation.Section 770.212_Construction.This section would require grant recipients to assure that constructionactivities that receive FHWA or UMTA funding conform with the approvedSIP. Coordination with the State air pollution control agency is also required.These requirements apply to transportation projects funded by UMTA as wellas to those funded by FHWA.The existing and proposed conformity and prority procedures are geographicallylimited to those areas having SIP's which contain TCM's for the attainmentor maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards. However,the construction procedures in this section apply in all geographical areasregardless of air quality attainment status. The provisions in this section are unchanged from the existing provisions,except for the deletion of the requirement to have revisions to the constructionspecifications made in consultation with FHWA and UMTA, as appropriate.Since FHWA and UMTA already provide for consultation on specification changes,this requirement is redundant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Related Regulations</ITAG>The FHWA and UMTA issued their current Environmental Impact and RelatedProcedures Regulations on August 28, 1987, at 52 FR 32645. Additional requirementsfor compliance with the NEPA are contained in the regulations of the CEQ(40 CFR 1500-1508) and DOT Order 5610.1C, Procedures for Considering EnvironmentalImpacts (44 FR 56420, October 1, 1979).Under these requirements, an air quality analysis is still required aspart of the EIS process. The results of the analysis are included in theEIS, and air quality impacts are considered during the review of the EIS.However, this project-level air quality analysis is not required in orderto determine conformity. This is the difference between the CAA and theNEPA_conformity is based on a comparison of transportation plans and programswith air quality plans and programs contained in the SIP, while the anaylsisfor the EIS is an evaluation of the anticipated pollutant emissions, dispersionand resultant concentration in the vicinity of the proposed project.The FHWA and UMTA have also published a final rule (48 FR 30332, June 30,1983) which amended the Urban Tranportation Planning regulation (23 CFRPart 450 and 49 CFR Part 613). Those revisions include a reference to theprocedures in this regulation in order to tie the planning process to theair quality conformity and priority process. For the same reason, the provisionsof andSection;andSection; 770.208 and 770.210 of this regulation include referencesto the urban transportation planning process and the corresponding regulation.Section 770.210 of this regulation also refers to 23 CFR Part 630, SubpartA, Federal-Aid Programs Approval and Project Authorization, which providesfor FHWA review and approval of programs and projects proposed by Statehighway agencies. This regulation will be revised. Language will be includedin the revised regulation to require that ``(p)rojects shall reflect implementationpriority if they have been identified as Transportation Control Measures(TCM) in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) (23 CFR Part 770) revisedpursuant to Part D of Title I of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506).''<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Matters</ITAG>The FHWA and UMTA have detemined that this proposed rule is not a majorrule under Executive Order 12291. However, it is a significant regulationunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures because the amendments involveimportant departmental policy. A regulatory evaluation is available forinspection in the public docket and may be obtained by contacting any ofthe individuals listed above under the heading ``For Further InformationContact.''The Administrators certify under the Regulatory Flexibility Act that thisproposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. It is possible that application of this proposedrule could have an adverse economic impact on small governmental jurisdictionslocated in areas where transportation plans or programs are subject toFederal assistance limitations or do not conform the the SIP. However,the potential impacts derive primarily from the CAA and not from the procedurescontained in this proposed rule. An additional consideration with respectto the Federal-aid highway program is that highway projects have been subjectto the analogous consistency requirement of 23 U.S.C. 109(j) since 1970.This proposed rule is not subject to Section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct, since it does not require the collection or retention of any new data.The proposed rule only requires the States to make use of existing dataand information that they have already collected under regulations issuedby the EPA.This proposed regulation would apply to both FHWA and UMTA actions. Itwould be published as Part 770 of Title 23, CFR with a cross-referencein Part 623 of Title 49, CFR.
