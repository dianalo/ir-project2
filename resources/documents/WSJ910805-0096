The volcano's continuing eruptions are just the latestcalamity to befall the archipelago in recent years, alongwith typhoons, floods, earthquakes, coup attempts,kidnappings and plane crashes. But the Philippines is one ofAsia's least successful tourist destinations not only becauseof its off-putting disasters, but because of problems withinfrastructure, investment, organization and marketing.</LP><TEXT>   With 7,100 islands, pristine beaches and verdanthighlands, the country should be one of Asia's major holidayplaygrounds. &quot;I don't think anyone doubts the potential ofthe Philippines,&quot; says Randolph Guthrie, managing director ofHong Kong's Shangri-La International Hotels andamp; Resorts. &quot;Itspotential is far greater than any country&quot; in Asia other thanChina.   The Philippines offers low prices, an English-speakingpopulation, wildlife, Spanish colonial relics and coastalwaters that divers consider to be among the best. Thecountry's location makes it a perfect short-haul destinationfor the increasing numbers of tourists coming out of Japan,South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. With better airlinks and savvy marketing, the Philippines could attract lotsof tourists from Europe and North America as well.   &quot;They ought to be doing spectacularly,&quot; says WilliamOverholt, regional strategist for Bankers Trust Co. in HongKong. &quot;They could have 30 to 40 times more {tourism}revenues. They should be sheets ahead of Thailand.&quot;   Yet the Philippines ranks next to the bottom in visitorarrivals among the six members of the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations, beating only tiny Brunei. Itwelcomes fewer than one million visitors a year, and thatfigure includes more than 130,000 returning Filipinos andmany Americans affiliated with the U.S. bases in the country.The other Asean nations -- Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia andIndonesia -- each receives between two and seven times asmany visitors a year.   Some of the structural impediments that weigh on thePhilippine tourism industry are starting to be addressed, butanalysts and industry executives agree that the economicallystrapped country isn't generating the new jobs andforeign-exchange earnings that it could if its potential werefully exploited.   &quot;The easiest way to make foreign exchange in any countryis tourism,&quot; says Rebecco Panlilio, chairman of Sulo Group,which owns two hotels in Manila and the Puerto Azul resortsouth of the capital.   While tourism is the Philippines' third-largestforeign-exchange earner, current annual receipts of $1.2billion to $1.4 billion could easily increase fourfold if theindustry were performing up to its potential, according toBaring Securities (Philippines) Inc.   The Philippine tourism industry is heavily populated bysmall, locally owned resorts and hotels, many of them withouthot water or air conditioning. The archipelago also ispeppered with grandiose state-owned hotels built during theMarcos era and in sore need of renovation.   &quot;Since hardly any {foreign} tourists come, we cater todomestic tourism,&quot; says J. Antonio Leviste, president of theResort Association of the Philippines.   Poor infrastructure is a major reason the country lacksforeign interest. For arriving tourists, the trouble beginsat the airport. Only three in the country are open tointernational flights. State-owned Philippine Airlines, whichhas a near-monopoly on local routes, doesn't have enoughairplanes to meet domestic demand. To transfer from aninternational flight to a domestic one in Manila, touristsmust change airports. And getting to some of theout-of-the-way destinations that foreign tourists crave, suchas Boracay and El Nido, takes hours and involves airplanes,boats and other means.   &quot;You've got to really want to go there,&quot; says a Hong Kongbanker who has traveled widely in the Philippines.   In addition, the country's road system is poor, and hoteldevelopers must invest in their own sewage-treatment andwater-supply systems, as well as electricity generators tocover frequent power shortages. Telephone service outsidegreater Manila and the province of Cebu is creaky, andrestaurants, shopping and other attractions for visitors aresparse.   But improving these conditions takes time. And thegovernment, though trying to remedy some of the most obviousproblems, is preoccupied with agrarian reform, privatizationof state-owned assets, the fate of the U.S. military bases,and now, Mount Pinatubo.   As for private-sector investment in tourism, Filipinobusinessmen concede that the bulk of the funds needed to helpthe industry take off will have to come from abroad. Thecountry's capital base is too low to generate sufficientinvestment, they say, and borrowing and raising equity athome are difficult.   But Manila has so far done little to encourage foreigninvestment in tourism or other industries. Foreigners areprohibited from owning land, and they can hold no more than40% of a Philippine business. There also are strict limits onthe number of expatriates they can employ, and for how long,and sometimes restrictions on repatriating profits.   A new foreign-investment bill, scheduled to become law inNovember, addresses some of these woes. Though thelegislation is still being drafted, specialists expect thatthe law will allow 100% foreign ownership of tourismprojects. New rules also probably would cut red tape andoffer financial incentives for tourism investments outsideManila.   The country also must spend a lot more on advertising toimprove its image. &quot;It is futile to try to get foreigners tocome to a country with the image of the Philippines,&quot; saysMr. Leviste of the resort association. &quot;I wouldn't go toNicaragua or Beirut. I feel that's what foreigners think ofthe Philippines.&quot;   Though the country's political unrest and naturaldisasters can't be papered over completely, more could bedone to highlight the Philippines' many good points. SaysEmilio Osmena, governor of Cebu province: &quot;We're notpackaging. We're not selling. We're not promoting.&quot;   Part of the problem is lack of coordination and money.&quot;The airline can't do it alone,&quot; says Enrique Santos, a vicepresident of Philippine Airlines. &quot;It has to be a jointeffort between airline and government. There hasn't beenenough of that.&quot;   Manila merchants who cater to tourists know first-hand theurgency of the situation. &quot;A sales blitz should beimplemented in other countries,&quot; says Rommel Faustino,co-owner of Via Antica, an antique store in Manila's Ermitadistrict. Mr. Faustino says that his walk-in business is slowand that his sales haven't recovered from a 50% plunge afteran attempted coup rocked the country in 1989.   In the nearby Pistang Pilipino handicrafts market,Victoria Olea says sales in her leather shop amount to zeromost days. Tourists who show even mild curiosity formerchandise are immediately offered lower prices. &quot;You don'thave to bargain for the price here anymore,&quot; she says.</TEXT></DOC>
