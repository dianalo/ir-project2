PurposeIn 1985, the Commission adopted Order No. 436 \1\<NOTE/> to launch a new era of open-access transportation by pipelinesperforming self-implementing transportation under either the Natural GasAct \2\<NOTE/> or the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA).\3\<NOTE/> The Commission codified its new open-access transportationprogram in Part 284 of its regulations.\4\<NOTE/> In Part 284, the Commission set forth its objectives andpolicies with respect to the designing of rates for a pipeline's open-accesstransportation services. As a result of its experience in designing transportationrates under the principles of Order No. 436, and in examining the designof the transportation component of sales rates, the Commission here statesthat the same goals and policies are equally applicable to both types ofrates. The purpose of this order is to provide the administrative law judges(ALJs) and the participants (including the Commission staff) in the above-captionedproceedings with additional guidance on how to implement the Commission'srate objectives and policies under Part 284.\5\<NOTE/> This policy statement will enable the participants to developfactual records under which the ALJs, in the first instance, and the Commissionon review can fashion comprehensive rate design schemes tailored to particularpipelines which will fulfill the intent of the NGPA that market forcesplay a ``more significant role in determining the supply, the demand, andthe price of natural gas,'' \6\<NOTE/> and the mandate of the Natural Gas Act that a pipeline'srates must be just and reasonable and must not result in any undue preferenceor undue discrimination.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial WellheadDecontrol, [Reg.

General Principles</ITAG>The ratemaking process begins with the establishment of a cost of serviceor revenue requirement, continues through a series of steps by which thecosts are assigned to various services and customer groups, and concludeswith development of unit rates.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The establishment of a cost of service thus of necessitylinks rate design to costs. However, it has been recognized that the assignmentof costs ``is not a matter for the slide rule . . . . It has no claim toan exact science.'' \1\\5\<NOTE/> It ``is not reducible to a simple mathematical exercise.''\1\\6\<NOTE/> This means that cost assignment is more than simple mechanicalaccounting procedure of cost causation. Rather, cost assignment is a meansfor accomplishing a complex of sometimes contradictory goals and for reconcilingoften conflicting interests in the process of assigning revenue responsibilityamong the pipeline's diverse services and customers. The Commission's taskis to weigh all relevant considerations by ``integrat[ing] cost factorswith non-cost factors and policy considerations'' to fashion rates foreach customer which are within the zone of reasonableness.\1\\7\<NOTE/> Hence, the Commission is ``not required to adopt any particularrate design.'' \1\\8\<NOTE/> It is the ``total effect'' of the rate design method whichcounts rather than the particular rate design method employed.\1\\9\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission encourages the participants in theseproceedings to develop different methods to achieve the rate objectives,set forth in the Commission's regulations and discussed below, that aretailored to the particular circumstances of a pipeline's system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The pipeline's cost of service or revenue requirementis assigned to its customers through the rate design process. The firststep in the rate design process is to divide the cost-of-service amongthe pipeline's major operations or functions such as production, gathering,transmission and storage. This step is called cost functionalization. Thenext step is to categorize the pipelines functionalized costs as eitherfixed or variable costs. The pipeline's costs are then classified (<T3>i.e., </T3>assigned) to the demand and commodity componnents of itsrates. This step is traditionally called cost classification. Next, theclassified costs are allocated between the pipeline's jurisdictional andnonjurisdictional services, and among its jurisdictional zones. Ths stepis called cost allocation. Last, unit rates for each service are determined.This step is also know as rate design, <T3>See </T3>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 46 FERC andpara; 61,113 at p. 61,441n.3 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>Colorado Interstate Gas Co. </T3>v. <T3>FPC, </T3>324 U.S. 581, 589 (1945).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>Fuels Research Councils, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>FPC, </T3>374 F.2d 842, 846 (7th Cir. 1967).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>Northern Indiana Public Service Co. </T3>v. <T3>FERC, </T3>782 F.2d 730, 742 (7th Circ. 1986), <T3>citing FPC </T3>v. <T3>Conway Corp., </T3>426 US. 271, 277-79 (1976).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ <T3>Id. </T3>at739.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>Fuels Research Councils, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>FPC, </T3>374 F.2d 842, 850-51 (7th Cir. 1967), <T3>Citing FPC </T3>v <T3>Hope Natural Gas Co., </T3>320 U.S. 591, 602 (1942).The Commission notes that to the extent a particular method is theoreticallyconsistent with these objectives but leads to undesirable or inequitableresults, pragmatic adjustments can and should be made. These concerns willbe addressed in particular cases after designing rates in light of theother goals. Then, the Commission can make any necessary adjustments tomitigate harsh or undesirable results.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Theory-Economic Efficiency</ITAG>Section 284.7 of the Commission's regulations sets forth the Commission'sobjectives in designing transportation rates. Sections 284.7(c)(1) statesthat ``[r]ates for service during peak periods should ration capacity.''Section 284.7(c)(2) provides that ``[r]ates for firm service during off-peakperiods and for interruptible service during all periods should maximizethroughput.'' As stated above, those objectices are of equal applicabilityto the transportation portion of bundled sales rates. The objectives provideguidance in the development of rates that promote economic efficiency;that is, the efficient functioning of natural gas markets. Transportationrats (and policies) which inhibit efficient operation of markets are themselvesinefficient and can not result in an equitable assignment of the pipeline'scosts or revenue responsibility. The Commission is concerned with allocativeand productive efficiency. Hence, economic efficiency is a necessary, butnot necessarily the only objective which will enable the Commission tofashion just and reasonable, nondiscriminatory rates for all customersthrough the rate design process. Allocative efficiency simply means that those who value the product orservice the most should be the ones to have it. Productive efficiency simplymeans that products and services should be provided at the least possiblecost. A price or rate is inefficient if a different pricing scheme canbe developed which would make all ratepayers and the company better off.\20\<NOTE/> For example, discounting prices to or above marginal coststo attract business will benefit other customers by lowering their contributionto fixed costs. Hence, a scheme which inhibits discounting may be inefficientand inequitable.\21\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Put another way, an efficient pricing scheme is one whereno one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ <T3>See Associated Gas Distributors </T3>v. <T3>FERC, </T3>824 F.2d 981, 1010-11 (D.C. Cir. 1987). (``[P]ipeline transportationservice is marked by a degree of natural monopoly * * * In such an industry,`value of service' ratemaking (<T3>i.e., </T3>rates varying on the basis of differing demand characteristics)has an established place, though not an an uncontested one. The equitableargument in favor of such differentials is that they may benefit captivecustomers by making a contribution to fixed costs that otherwise wouldnot be made at all. (The efficiency argument is that such differentialswill raise total volume closer to the level it would attain if all saleswere priced at marginal cost.)'' (Footnotes omitted)).Section 284.7 of the Commission's regulations reflects the Commission'sgoals of allocative and productive efficiency in the fashioning of maximumrates by requiring that peak rates ration capacity and that rates maximizethroughout during all periods. The Commission has recognized in andSection;284.7(d)(3)(i) that it will be necessary in certain instances to achievethose objectives by the use of seasonal rates for peak and off-peak periods.Moreover, the Commission has recognized in andSection; 284.7(d)(5) that itmay be necessary to selectively discount maximum rates to meet competitionand attract or maintain business.\22\<NOTE/> Rates designed to attain those objectives should result inan efficient allocation of capacity to those who value it and in productiveefficiency by eliminating disincentives in the transportation of gas.\23\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ 18 CFR 284.7(d)(5). <T3>See </T3>Associated Gas Distributors v. FERC, 824 F.2d 981, 1010-1012(D.C. Cir. 1987) (``For nearly 100 years, * * * the coursts have interpretedthe antidiscrimination provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act to allowthe ICC to approve differentials justified exclusively by competition.'')(at 1011).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ The Commission recognizes that heretofore it has requiredallocation using the ``first-come first-served'' principle, with some possiblereallocation where a new shipper is willing to pay a higher rate up tothe maximum rate and the existing shipper is unwilling to match the higherrate. That principle has led to the current positions in the queues forfirm and interruptible transportation services today on open access pipelinesacross the country under the first-come, first-served mechanism as currentlyimplemented. A shift in emphasis now to mechanisms and rates which moredirectly allocate capacity to those who value it more highly may requirea transition, as individual rate cases are considered; and the Commissionencourages the parties to consider how best to accommodate such transitions,while avoiding any unnecessary complication of or disruption to transportationservices provided across the country. The Commission also acknowledgesthat individual pipeline systems may have characteristics which justifyvarious transitional mechanisms in any reorientation of capacity allocationmethodologies.In addition, a pipeline's sales and transportation services must be equivalentservices in their treatment of the transportation of gas. Neither the transportationnor the sales service should provide a subsidy to the other service. Inshort, there should be no cross-subsidization between transportation andsales services. As the Commission has stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">[I]n light of the goals of this rule, rates should be so designedthat the transportation component will not differ whether the customeris purchasing sales or transportation service.\24\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Order No. 436, <T3>supra </T3>n. 1, at p. 31,535. <ITAG tagnum="10">Of course, transportation and sales rates should recognize any differencesin the quality of those services. For example, where firm sales customershave the benefit of all of a pipeline's production area facilities andfirm transportation customers are limited in their access to receipt pointsto their aggregate mainline quantities, different maximum rate treatmentwould be justified. The absence for firm transportation customers of proportionalaccess to production area facilities, flexible receipt points, and equalaccess to system storage facilities would justify a lower maximum ratethan that embedded in the sales rate. Since rates should reflect the qualityof the service, a lower quality service should have a lower rate. With this discussion in mind, the Commission turns to specifics of therate design process on which it wants a record to be developed. III. The Issues The Commission observes that the issues to be discussed, such as the derivationof seasonal rates, demand charges, maximum interruptible rates, and discountedrates are interrelated because they encompass the division of costs (<T3>i.e., </T3>revenue responsibility) among various services and customers.The end result of the ratemaking process should as a whole promote theCommission's goals of, among other things, allocative and productive efficiencyas discussed above.The ALJs and the participants must develop records which delve into andresolve the following issues consistent with the directions of this policystatement. In addition, the participants must establish records on, andthe ALJs must consider and articulate the impacts (benefits and detriments)of, the various rate design proposals on the participants, on the varioussegments of the industry, and on classes of customers. The ALJs are alsodirected to explicitly articulate equitable factors considered in designingthe rates, for example, whether rates design changes should be phased in.\2\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>See</T3> p. 5 <T3>supra</T3> on pragmatic adjustments.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Annual Versus Seasonal Rates</ITAG>Section 284.7(d)(3) provides that rates ``must reasonably reflect any materialvariation in the cost of providing service due to * * * [w]hether the serviceis provided during a peak or off-peak period.'' The Commission has referredto the cost of fuel used to run compressors as an example of a cost thatmight differ or vary between peak and off-peak periods.\2\\6\<NOTE/> However, andSection; 284.7(d)(3) only requires that at a minimumsuch marginal costs as the cost of compressor fuel be considered. Otherfactors such as differing demands for service between peak and off-peakperiods may be considered. Based on experience, the Commission is concernedthat the derivation of demand and commodity rates without regard to seasonalvariations in use of, or demands on, the pipeline does not properly rationpeak capacity or lead to efficient use of the pipeline in periods of excesscapacity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 37 FERC andpara; 61,260at p. 61,705-06 (1986).Accordingly, evidence must be presented as to whether a pipeline has sufficientlydifferentiated patterns of usage to justify peak and off-peak demand orcommodity rates or both to fulfill the goal of economic efficiency.\2\\7\<NOTE/> If seasonal rates are warranted, then costs incurred to performpeak season service (such as the cost of certain system storage facilities)should be assigned solely to that service and other costs assigned to thepeak period based on demand factors.\2\\8\<NOTE/> That is, differences in the demand for service between periodsshould be recognized in rates to efficiently ration capacity. However,it should also be considered whether the costs associated with the peakservice period are appropriately reflected in the demand charge but aremerely billed throughout the year to reasonably soften the impact on consumersof otherwise high peak fuel bills. These rates are seasonal with only thepayment schedule levelized. The payment schedule of rates should not affecthow the rates are designed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ It appears that many pipelines have a five-month winterpeak from November 1 through March 31. The remaining seven-months are off-peak.This may vary by company.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ One approach would be to assign seasonal costs by seasonalload factors. Another might be to assign the cost of transmission facilitiesused to provide service above the annual load factor to the peak period.The remaining transmission costs could be divided evenly between the seasons.For example, if the peak period load factor is 90 percent, the annual loadfactor is 50 percent, and D-1 costs are $100, then $70 would be assignedto the peak period (90% ^ 50% = 40% andmultiply; $100 = $40 + 50% andmultiply;$60 ($100 ^ $40) = $30), and $30 would be assigned to the off-peak period(50% andmultiply; $60 ($100 ^ $40)).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Demand and Commodity Charges</ITAG>a. <T3>General.</T3> The process of dividing (<T3>i.e.,</T3> classifying) fixed transmission and storage costs betweenthe demand and commodity components is closely related to the seasonalrate issue as both involve the assignment of costs for the purpose of peakpricing to achieve the Commission's goal of rationing peak capacity tothose who value it the most. In addition, cost classification, by determiningthe level of costs in the commodity charge, is relevant to the Commission'sgoal of throughput maximization.At present, most pipelines' costs are classified under the modified fixedvariable method (MFV). The MFV method classifies all fixed production andgathering costs, all variable costs, and return on equity investment intransmission and storage facilities and related income taxes to the commoditycomponent. The remaining fixed costs, including return of investment intransmission plant and storage facilities (<T3>i.e.,</T3> depreciation expense), are classified to the demand component.\2\\9\<NOTE/> The MFV demand component currently consists of two demandcharges. The first, or D-1 charge, reflects peak considerations. The second,or D-2 charge, reflects annual considerations. The costs classified tothe demand component are assigned to the D-1 and D-2 charges on a 50-50basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ Upstream pipeline charges are assigned to the downstreampipeline's demand and commodity components in the same manner as the chargesare billed by the upstream pipeline to the downstream pipeline. This isthe ``as-billed'' doctrine.The Commission is concerned that MFV may be outdated in light of the significantchanges in the nature of the gas pipeline industry since the adoption ofOrder No. 436 in 1985 and the further decontrol of gas under the NGPA.\3\\0\<NOTE/> In particular, the MFV division of costs between the demandand commodity components was designed to help pipelines in their role asa merchant.\3\\1\<NOTE/> But today most major interstate pipelines are functioningprimarily as transporters. In addition, the D-2 charge was adopted in partto soften the impact on low load factor customers of the shift of fixedcosts from the commodity charge to the demand charge. However, those verycustomers have objected to the D-2 charge on the ground that D-2 nominationswill, in fact, shift costs to the low load factor customers.\3\\2\<NOTE/> Moreover, the transition period has been completed.\3\\3\<NOTE/> Hence a D-2 charge may no longer be warranted.\3\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ MFV was first adopted in 1983 in Natural Gas PipelineCompany of America, 25 FERC andpara; 61,176 (1983), <T3>order on reh'q,</T3> 26 FERC andpara; 61,203 (1984), <T3>aff'd in relevant part,</T3> <T3>Northern </T3><T3>Indiana Public Service Co.</T3> v. <T3>FERC,</T3> 782 F.2d 730 (7th Cir. 1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ MFV changed the assignment of fixed costs to the commoditycharge from either the United method's 75 percent or the Seaboard method's50 percent. In almost all cases, this reduced the share of fixed costsin the commodity charge.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ <T3>E.g.,</T3> Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 46 FERC andpara; 61,113 at p.61,445-46 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Corp., 46 FERC andpara;61,364 at p. 62,139 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ <T3>See also Id.</T3>b. <T3>The Central Question.</T3> The task is to determine the division offixed costs between the peak related charge (D-1) and the charges associatedwith annual usage (the D-2 and commodity charges). The central questionis whether the costs assigned to the D-1 charge are appropriate in amountto ration peak capacity to those who value it the most.\3\\5\<NOTE/> The answer may depend on whether there is a waiting listfor firm capacity. Such a queue may indicate that the present D-1 (peak)charge is not rationing capacity. If capacity is consistently underbooked,it may be that the D-1 (peak) charge is excessive. In either event, theprice is not appropriate because it produces an inefficient allocationof capacity on the pipeline. If the D-1 charge needs to be increased toproperly reflect the demand for peak service, costs (<T3>i.e.,</T3> revenue responsibility) could be<ITAG tagnum="24">  shifted from the D-2 charge or, if necessary, from the commoditycharge. As to the latter, examples are fixed storage costs \3\\6\</ITAG><NOTE/> or some portion of return on equity.\3\\7\<NOTE/> In addition, as discussed above, the D-2 charge may no longerbe warranted. In that case, any costs remaining therein after a shift ofcosts to the D-1 charge should be moved into the commodity charge. Moreover,the use of seasonal rates may also obviate the need for a D-2 charge. Inaddition, the issue of whether and how undue cost shifts should be mitigatedin the short run (such as by a phasing in mechanism) should be considered.The aim is to soften the initial impact not to change an otherwise justand reasonable assignment of cost or revenue responsibility. The ALJs andthe participants must develop records to resolve the issues discussed here.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ The Commission recognizes that customers on many pipelinesdo not have opportunity to adjust their contract demand volumes, but thatsuch adjustments may be necessary to efficiently ration capacity. <T3>See infra</T3> Capacity Adjustments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\6\ The return and taxes on system storage investment arein the commodity charge at present and even though allocated by seasons,the storage may perform a peaking service and may belong wholly in thedemand charge. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ For example, the return on equity up to the T-billrate and related taxes might be reassigned to the D-1 charge with the remainderof the return and associated taxes staying in the commodity charge. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Capacity Adjustments </ITAG>The use of peak and off-peak rates and a change in cost classificationmight result in a shifting of a substantial amount of costs to the chargefor peak service. As stated above, the Commission's goal in any shiftingof costs to peak service is to ration peak capacity by price to those whovalue it the most. Therefore, the participants to these proceedings mustaddress and explore various ways to provide a contract demand adjustmentoption in tandem with increased charges for peak service due to the implementationof seasonal rates or classification changes to achieve the rationing capacityobjective. For example, pipelines and their customers must pursue contractdemand reductions in conjunction with peak rate increases. In addition,it might be appropriate for customers to have different daily contractdemand rights for peak and off-peak periods. Or, customers could be permittedthe use of different daily contract demand rights on a monthly basis.\3\\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ <T3>See also</T3> Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 46 FERC andpara;61,364 at p. 62,139 (1989). Additionally, the pipelines should consider offering a short-term contractdemand adjustment option to its firm sales and transportation customers.Firm sales and transportation customers could agree to release their capacityto the pipeline for a fixed term to enable the pipeline to resell the capacityas firm transportation under Part 284. For example, a firm customer mightconclude that it wants to retain its contract demand but that at presentit is not needed to serve customers in one season or for one or two years.The firm customer would inform the pipeline of this. The pipeline mighthave other customers or potential customers that want the assurance offirm transportation service for short terms as opposed to interruptibleservice. The pipeline would be obligated to offer the capacity for transportationunder Part 284 of the Commission's regulations. It would have to sell thereleased capacity on a nondiscriminatory basis and not favor affiliatesand would charge rates pursuant to andSection;andSection;284.7 and 284.8. Underthis kind of arrangement, the pipeline would share the proceeds with thefirm customers releasing capacity.\3\\9\<NOTE/> The details of such capacity releasing, including the methodof sharing proceeds and operational procedures,\4\\0\<NOTE/> would be determined in the individual proceedings.\4\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ If proceeds are shared with the customer releasingcapacity, costs need not be allocated to the transportation service thatwould be provided with the released capacity. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ For example, the pipeline might establish a separatequeue for this service with priority going to those in any current queuefor firm service. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ The capacity releasing described above differs fromcapacity brokering as described in the proposed capacity brokering rulemakingin Docket No. RM88-13-000 (Brokering of Interstate Natural Gas PipelineCapacity, Proposed Regulations, Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara; 32,460 (1988))and the United experiment described in United Gas Pipe Line Co., 46 FERCandpara; 61,060 (1989) in the following ways. The pipeline, not its customer,would be the only supplier of the service. The pipeline would be subjectto the unlawful discrimination proscription of its open-access certificatefor these transactions. Last, the pipeline would receive a fee as an incentivefor the resale of its customer's firm capacity. Nothing stated here should be viewed as preventing the participants fromconsidering either capacity brokering \4\\2\<NOTE/> or capacity reassignment by firm shippers.\4\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission has given the pipelines and participants awide range of options so that they can tailor their services to their particularneeds. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ <T3>See</T3> citations in footnote 41. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ <T3>See</T3> Wyoming-California Pipeline Co., 45 FERC andpara; 61,234, atp. 61,678 (1988), <T3>reh'g denied,</T3> 46 FERC andpara; 61,310 at pp. 61,927-28 (1989). <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Discounting and Maximum Interruptible Rates </ITAG>a. <T3>Discounting.</T3> Section 284.7(d) requires a pipeline to file maximumand minimum transportation rates for both firm and interruptible serviceand permits the pipeline to charge rates to customers within the maximumand minimum range. Under this section a pipeline is permitted to discountin order to maximize throughput and thereby benefit customers by spreadingfixed cost recovery over more units of service. Section 284.7(c)(3) statesthe rate objective that ``[t]he pipeline's revenue requirement allocatedto firm and interruptible services should be attained by providing theprojected units of service in peak and off-peak periods at the maximumrate for each service.'' \4\\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ A pipeline's projected units of service may only bechanged by the pipeline in a section 4 rate filing. The projected unitsof service concept involves giving pipelines an incentive to maximize throughput.Selective discounting furthers similar objectives, by allowing pipelinesto retain and attract business by meeting competition. Order No. 436, <T3>supra</T3> n. 1 at p. 31,546; Order No. 436-A, [Reg. Preambles 1982-1985]FERC Stats andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,675 at p. 31,679 (1985). Many have read this requirement to mean that a pipeline must assume infiling its next rate case that the volumes it has transported at discountedrates would still be transported if the maximum rate were charged. In lightof the competitive market that has emerged in the gas industry, this assumptionis not a realistic one. In other words, the problem with this objectiveis that if a pipeline must assume that previously discounted service willbe priced at the maximum rate when it files a new rate case there may bea disincentive to pipelines discounting their services in the future tocapture marginal firm and interruptible business. That would occur becausethe pipeline might not be able to recover its cost-of-service, if the maximumrates are based on throughput achieved by discounting. The court in<T3> Associated Gas Distributors </T3>v.<T3> FERC </T3>described this situation and stated that there was no reasonto suppose that the Commission intended for a pipeline to calculate pricesassuming the carriage of discounted traffic at a fully allocated price.\4\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ 824 F.2d 981, 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The objective set forth in andSection;284.7(c)(3) was designed to preventsubsidization of the discounts by the pipleines' nondiscounted rates.\4\\6\<NOTE/> That objective must be achieved in light of Order No. 436'sgoal of maximizing throughput. Therefore, the following discussion indicatesways to calculate a pipeline's rates after it has been discounting so asto achieve both objectives set out in the regulations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ <T3>See</T3> Order No. 436, <T3>supra</T3> n. 1 at p. 31,545. At the outset, however, the Commission reiterates that pipelines must givediscounts on a non-discriminatory basis, and the Commission is concernedabout selective discounts that have the potential for giving rise to unduediscrimination, including the potential for giving rise to undue discrimination,including discounts to affiliates.\4\\7\<NOTE/> The following discussion about how to design rates to avoida disincentive to discounting transportaion rates does not alter the standardsthat apply to the Commission's review of a pipeline's decision as to whenand how to discount. That is, discounts must be given on a nondiscriminatorybasis, and discounts to affiliates will be carefully scrutinized,\4\\8\<NOTE/> as will be the treatment of past discounts in projectingfuture units of service. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ See Order No. 497, note 7 <T3>supra</T3> at p. 31,135. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Order No. 436, <T3>supra</T3> n. 1 at p. 31,546 and Order No. 436-A, <T3>supra</T3> n. 44 at p. 31,679 (1985). One approach would be that maximum rates can be derived using separateestimates of units to be transported at the maximum rate and at discountedrates. Projected revenues from volumes at the maximum rate would be derivedusing only the units projected to be transported at the maximum rate. Revenuesfor service which can be retained or acquired at less than the maximumrate should be derived by a separate estimate of revenues assuming thelower rates. Another approach to avoid penalizing the pipeline for discountedservice would adjust the volumes attributable to ``undiscounted'' throughputby adding to those volumes some portion of the volumes that were transportedunder discounted rates. For example, if a unit of service can only be soldat one third of the maximum rate, one third of a unit would be added toprojected ``undiscounted'' throughput. The Commission also recognizes that in a rate case it may be difficultto forecast discounted units of service at particular prices. For example,discounts may depend on variables, such as the prices of alternative fuels.Accordingly, the ALJs and participants should consider methods which dealwith the problem of the difficulty in forecasting revenues from discountingand which also do not discourage the pipeline from transacting such business.\4\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ The Commission encourages the participants to developapproaches to this issue which are consistent with the overall objectiveof encouraging efficiency. The Commission is willing to consider, alongwith other proposals, the following two approaches in treating discountedtransportation volumes. <ITAG tagnum="28">One possible approach would be a benefit sharing approach wherebyat one extreme no volumes or revenues are allocated to discounted interruptibleservice. The pipeline would share revenues with firm customers which didnot use their total firm service, thereby making interruptible serviceavailable. The amount and method of sharing could be determined in theindividual proceedings. In return, the pipeline would share the benefitsof such service rather than keep all revenues from the discounted service.The firm customers would pay a higher rate for their service but in returnwould have the possibility of more than offsetting their higher rates bysharing the benefits of the pipeline's discounted service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">A less extreme approach could be to allocate costs or revenue responsibilityto discounted service in the proceeding. If the pipeline's revenues abovemarginal costs are below the costs assigned to the service, the pipelineand firm customers not using their total firm capacity would share in theburden of the deficit. If the revenues above marginal cost are in excessof the assigned costs, the pipeline would share the excess revenues withits firm customers which did not use their total firm capacity. The amountsand methods of sharing the losses and gains would be determined in theproceeding. There also could be agreed upon predetermined amounts for thepipeline to absorb as losses or keep as gains before sharing begins. </ITAG>b. <T3>Maximum Interruptible Rates.</T3> This section deals with the determinationof maximum interruptible rates. Section 284.7(d)(4) requires that maximuminterruptible rates be determined by the allocation of volumes and coststo interruptible service. In practice, this has been accomplished by theuse of the 100 percent load factor rate method.\5\\0\<NOTE/> As the Commission has recently stated, it is time to re-examinethe appropriateness of 100 percent load factor rates.\5\\1\<NOTE/> The Commission stated:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ In formula form, where D means demand and C means commodity,the 100 percent load factor rate is computed as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 46 FERC andpara;61,364 at p. 62,143 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p6,6/1,g1,t1,4,18,r50</C> <H1>D-1 </H1><H2>365 </H2><H1>andmultiply; 12 + D-2 + C = </H1><H1>rate per Mcf per day.</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has hitherto found that rates derived on a 100 percentload factor basis are just and reasonable. The central rationale has beenthat such a rate does no more than require interruptible customers to paya rate which includes all of the fixed costs of providing service. Moreover,the Commission has found that any difference in quality between interruptibleand firm service is recognized by the fact that interruptible customersbear none of the risk of unused capacity because they pay only for serviceused.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission believes that its and the industry's increased experiencewith interruptible service demonstrates that it is time to re-examine theCommission's policy concerning 100 percent load factor rates with respectto both the cost incurrence and quality of service rationales and otherfactors, such as the customers' competitive posture <T3>vis a vis</T3> alternative fuels and the possible need for seasonallydifferentiated rates. Accordingly, the Commission will permit the partiesin this proceeding as well as other proceedings where interruptible ratesare at issue to explore the issue of whether lower rates than those derivedon a 100 percent load factor basis are appropriate.\5\\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ <T3>Id.</T3> (Footnote omitted.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The issue is whether the 100 percent load factor rate yields a maximuminterruptible rate which is too high to efficiently maximize throughputand is therefore an inefficient allocation of costs or revenue responsibilityto interruptible service. The answer depends on an analysis of the pipeline'spackage of rates and services and not merely on an examination of the 100percent load factor method by itself. For example, the 100 percent loadfactor method may be an appropriate way to set a maximum rate which actsas a cap on a pipeline's market power where it is efficiently discountingto maximize throughput or where the pipeline is using peak and off-peakrates.Demand rates can also be viewed as both a charge for the right or optionto use capacity and as a charge to cover the costs associated with theuse of the capacity. If the demand rate is in part a charge for a rightto capacity, some portion of the demand charge is not related to costsincurred in providing service. That is, a part of the demand charge willbe associated solely with the value of the right to demand service. Thisapproach may warrant excluding costs assigned to the demand charge in wholeor in part when deriving maximum interruptible rates on an annual basis.Agian, the use of peak and off-peak rates also may warrant the use of peakand off-peak maximum interruptible rates derived under the 100 percentload factor method.Last, the Commission repeats that a rate for service should reflect thequality of the service as compared to other services.\5\\3\<NOTE/> For example, capacity releasing, capacity brokering, andcapacity assignment would create new classes of firm service. In addition,the ability to release, assign, or broker a service adds value to the serviceitself. The participants should address how these new services affect thequality of other services. The pipelines and participants can also considerdifferent services which vary in quality from the traditional firm andinterruptible services. The rates for both new and old services shouldreflect the different quality of the services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ <T3>See supra</T3> p. 8.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. </ITAG><T3>Transportation Rates</T3>The transportation of natural gas entails the movement of the gas froma point of entry into the pipeline to a point of delivery from the system.However, this is often accomplished by a process of displacement in whichgas is delivered into the system and received from the system by adjustingpressure. At times, a shipper's gas will not make a continuous forwardor direct haul. Section 284.7(d)(3) recognizes that there are differentpatterns of transportation in the pipeline industry by not mandating mileage-basedrates. Section 284.7(d)(3) requires only that rates ``reasonable reflectany material variation in the cost of providing service due to * * * [t]hedistance over which the transportation is provided.'' Order No. 436 discussedthis as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">[For example], on most pipeline systems the costs of providing serviceare materially affected by the distance the gas is transported. The ratesfor such a pipeline should reflect these differences. But on other pipelinesor for particular types of services distance may not materially affectthe cost of providing service. In these situations the rates need not bebased on mileage or zones. In short, all that is required is what is requiredof all rates: that they reflect the cost of providing the service. Again,the rate standards imposed by the rule will be applied in individual fact-specificcases.\5\\4\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ Order No. 436,<T3> supra</T3> n. 1, at p. 31,538.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Where gas is moved in a forward haul an Mcf-file rate may be appropriate,however andSection; 284.1 defines transportation to include an ``exchange,backhaul, displacement or other methods of transportation.'' Those formsof transportation consist of a wide variety of factual scenarios whichmake it difficult to formulate one policy to encompass all situations.The following discussion deals with forms of transportation which do notuse capacity in a forward haul and therefore may create additional capacity.For example, backhaul transportation occurs when a shipper delivers gasto a pipeline downstream of the point where the shipper receives gas fromthe pipeline. Of course, there is no actual physical backhaul or reversalof flow. The transaction is effectively an exchange where the pipelinedelivers either its own gas or another shipper's gas to the backhaul shipperin exchange for the latter's gas.\55\<NOTE/> The backhaul or exchange may create additional capacity onthe pipeline between the exchange (receipt and delivery) points and resultsin cost savings through the pipeline's avoidance of marginal costs. Hence,the pipeline's backhaul and exchange services are efficient. The questionis how to price those services. The ALJs and the participants must developrecords with respect to the appropriate maximum rate a pipeline shouldcharge for backhauls and exchanges.\56\<NOTE/> In addition, backhaul and exchange rates are within the pipeline'sselective discounting authority. While andSection; 284.7(d)(4) requires thata minimum rate ``be based on the average variable costs which are properlyallocated to the service to which the rate applies,'' a no fee minimumrate may be warranted to permit pipelines and shippers to agree that nofee should be charged when an arrangement is mutually beneficial and producessubstantially equal benefits. Last, backhauls and exchanges must be performedon a non-discriminatory basis.\57\<NOTE/> In that regard, the Commission is concerned that pipelinesgenerally might not offer no fee or minimum fee transactions to shippersother than other pipelines and pipeline affiliated shippers. The Commissionintends that any pipeline offering such transactions to other pipelinesand/or pipeline affiliated shippers must also extend the same opportunityto all other shippers under terms and conditions whereby all similarlysituated shippers, regardless of pipeline or affiliate status, must havean equal opportunity to utilize such transactions. The Commission alsonotes that any such transactions between a particular pipeline and itsaffiliate would be subject to Order No. 497.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ In a more typical ``exchange'' arrangement, two or moreparties would be delivering gas and two or more parties would be receivinggas. Quite often, the parties involved in such exchanges are interstatepipelines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ Cases where the Commission permitted pipelines to usetheir direct haul rates no longer embody Commission policy. <T3>E.g., </T3>Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 37 FERC andpara; 61,260at p. 61,708 (1986); Northern Natural Gas Co., 37 FERC andpara; 61,272 atp. 61,815 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ See Northern Natural Gas Co., 37 FERC andpara; 61,272 atp. 61,815 (1986).IV. Separating ServicesSection 284.7(d) requires that a ``rate * * * separately identify costcomponents attributable to transportation, storage, and gathering costs.''However, section 284(d)(4)(i) also requires that rates ``recover * * *solely those costs which are properly allocated to the service to whichthe rate applies.'' Hence, a pipeline should only charge for gatheringand storage services actually performed for a customer. The ALJs and theparticipants are directed to fashion records to determine whether the pipeline'sstorage functions and gathering and other production area services, suchas processing and production area transportation, should be offered asseparate services with separately charged rates and, if so, what wouldbe the appropriate rates. This does not mean that a bundled rate is inappropriate.The Commission, however, prefers fully unbundled services. In addition,the pipelines and the participants should explore, in addition to traditionalservice, the pipeline separately selling gas (the commodity) without thetransportation service, with the customer using its right to capacity tomove the gas.V. ConclusionThe ALJs and the participants (including the Commission staff) should developrecords consistent with the content of this policy statement. The ALJsare directed to reopen the records, if necessary, to develop the recordson the issues discussed above. The participants must establish recordson, and the ALJs must consider and articulate the impacts (benefits anddetriments) of, the various rate design proposals on the participants,on the various segments of the industry, and on classes of customers. TheALJs are also directed to explicitly articulate equitable factors consideredin designing the rates.\58\<NOTE/> However, the participants are not limited to the methodologiesand issues discussed above. The Commission will consider other methodsthat will achieve the goals of rationing peak capacity and maximizing throughout.The Commission emphasizes that it is not mandating a particular end result.As stated earlier, the end result is to be tailored to the particular circumstancesof a pipeline system. To the extent a pipeline has several rate cases pending,the ALJs and the participants should decide in which proceeding it wouldbe appropriate to develop records on the issues discussed above.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ See p. 5, <T3>supra, </T3>on pragmatic adjustments.In these proceedings the ALJs should not grant requests for late interventionby persons who seek to intervene to participate in the additional recorddevelopment required by this order unless such late intervenors have adirect stake in the outcome of the proceeding and their interest wouldnot be adequately represented by existing parties. The Commission intendsthat the ALJs exercise their discretion to grant late intervention in thesecases very sparingly. The Commission does not intend to transform any ofthese proceedings into generic industry-wide forums for policy development.Any persons that are not currently parties to the rate cases listed inthe caption to this order and any party in one of those rate cases thatwants to seek rehearing of the general policy statements in this ordershould file in Docket No. PL89-2-000.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.

I also have very strong reservations about the discounting featureof the policy statement. While there have been several modifications tothe draft discussed at the May 17, 1989, Commission meeting, I still haveserious procedural and substantive concerns that have not been addressed.I discuss the following comments, recommendations, and revised text inan effort to sharpen the focus on those issues. I look forward to reviewingthese matters further on rehearing. Hopefully, the Commission can resolveas many of these issues as possible in the final policy statement on rehearing.</ITAG>2.<T3>Major Interstate Pipelines Not Included in the Policy Statement</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment</ITAG>This issue was discussed at the May 17 meeting, but remains unresolved.I am still concerned that our failure to address rate design issues onthese pipelines is a large gap in the interstate system by any measure.That failure also could extend a competitive advantage to these pipelinesover competing pipelines directly subject to this policy statement. Italso virtually precludes any hope of near-term uniformity and consistencyin general rate design. Additionally, the Policy Statement largely reiteratesrate design principles first enunciated in Order No. 436 in October, 1985,after a Notice of Inquiry and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, so therehas been more than abundant time over the past three and a half years tomake adjustments to conform. The OPPR memo of May 19, 1989, indicates thatnine pipelines are not included in this policy statement. They fall intofive distinct categories described below. The dates in parentheses foreach pipeline indicate when the pipeline would be obligated by currentregulations (which could change as a function of other policy initiatives)to file a new rate case where the rate design issues could be addressed.I would note that most are at least a year away and some are late 1992.The categories and included pipelines are as follows:(1) Settlement just approved: Southern (10/89)(2) Initial Decision Pending: CIG (7/90)(3) Settlement certified and pending: Arkla (6/91), Natural (1/92), TexasGas (11/92), Questar (11/91)(4) Settlement approved, but rehearing still pending: Algonquin (5/90),United (11/91)(5) New rate case filed, suspension order pending on May 31 Agenda: ANRFootnote 5 on page 2 of the slip op. acknowledges the fact that the captiondoes not include proceedings pending before the Commission, while statingan intent to apply the principles in the policy statement to those caseson a ``case-by-case basis.'' Apparently, that case-by-case basis wouldinvolve a balancing of the degree of conformity with these rate designprinciples, the procedural status of the case, support or opposition andthe overall acceptability of the rate proposal.I do not support a case-by-case approach to this requirement, because thereare always cogent arguments for approving a settlement once it gets tothe Commission. As noted above, there has been abundant time to implementmost of these principles first enunciated in Order No. 436. In that regard,I would not be surprised if the Natural settlement scheduled for the May31, 1989, Commission Meeting is largely approved, even though it deviatesmaterially from the thrust of this policy statement on certain key features.That could likely be the pattern for the other eight pipelines as well.B. RecommendationModify the order to state that, consistent with the Commission's intentionthat the identified rate design principles be addressed on an industry-widebasis and also to avoid any competitive advantage to a non-included pipeline,the Commission states its intent to require that parties in categories(2), (3), (4), and (5) above and Southern when it files the rate case tobe effective 10/89 will be required to address the matters set forth inthe policy statement. To that end, the Commission will issue supplementalorders in the respective dockets establishing expedited procedures to satisfythat requirement. The Commission notes that its failure to impose sucha requirement would mean that those pipelines would not be required effectivelyto address these rate design issues for periods of from one to three anda half years, which would otherwise be unacceptable, and that those pipelinescould obtain an important competitive advantage over the pipelines listedin the dockets in this order. (A compromise might be that the docket forany pipeline not required to file a new rate case within 6 months or 1year would be subject to this requirement).3. <T3>General Issue of Policy Direction or Guidance</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment </ITAG>While I appreciate that there apparently is some disagreement about mandatingspecific rate design results, I believe the current draft is still tooweak under any circumstances as a general matter (with the exception ofdiscounting, discussed below, on which I disagree with the mandated result).Legally, under <T3>Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. </T3>v. <T3>FPC</T3>, 506 F.2d 33 (D.C. Cir. 1974), we could go much farther ifwe chose to do so, either generally or on any specific issues. The courtthere sustained a strong FPC policy statement on curtailment prioritiesas that issue became manifest in a series of cases. The FCPC has statedits intention to follow a particular end use priority schedule, unlessa particular company demonstrated that a different curtailment plan wasmore in the public interest or where extraordinary circumstances wouldpreclude strict adherence to the curtailment policy in the policy statement.While opportunity would be afforded interested parties in specific casesto challenge or support the new policy through factual or legal presentations,the FPC concluded that, based on its review of the records of various proceedingsand its general knowledge of the industry, the curtailment schedules shouldbe applied to all jurisdictional pipelines, unless extraordinary circumstancescould be established.Given our express acknowledgement that we have permitted rates that werenot completely consistent with the objectives and requirements of OrderNo. 436 and our general experience otherwise, I believe, as a matter ofpolicy, we should at least consider a strnger position in the order, (1)on a generic basis, and (2) with some of all of the individual rate designfeatures. We would be on firm legal ground and we have full justificationunder the express requirements and preamble discussion in Order No. 436.In the alternative, if we adopt the more ``wishy-washy'' approach in thecurrent order for the Order No. 436 items, it can only signal that we continueto lack the requisite commitment or resolve to force these rate designfeatures as a general matter consistent with the clear intent of OrderNo. 436. I would prefer strongly not to support that result. The followingrecommendation addresses the generic approach in the current draft.B. RecommendationThe discussion in the first paragraph on page 3 is a positive assertionof our current intent to enforce the requirements of andSection; 284.7 andrequire pipelines to bear the burden of justifying any deviation. Subsequentdiscussion of specific issues and the conclusion on page 20, however, can,and probably will, be read as a far lesser requirement that the partiesin each case only really are required to address these issues, but notsatisfy the objectives and specific requirements of Order No. 436 and andSection;284.7, among others. To preemptively negate that general impression, addthe following statement before the last paragraph on page 21.``Finally, the Commission reiterates its commitment that the rates on anyjurisdictional pipeline subject to Order No. 436 must comply with the requirementsof Order No. 436 generally and specifically with the requirements of andSection;284.7 of the regulations, unless the pipline persuasively establishes thata particular deviation is justified on that system. In that regard, basedon our review of various Order No. 436 proceedings and our general knowledgeof the industry in today's market situation, we have conluded generallythat, barring extraordinary circumstances justifiying such a deviation,the rate design features set forth in Order No. 436 must now be implementedon all subject pipelines. While opportunity will be afforded to interestedparties in specific cases as set forth above, we have resolved to be guidedgenerally in our review of the cases by that conclusion.''4. <T3>Annual Versus Seasonal Rates</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment </ITAG>Section 284.7 clearly establishes the requirement for much more than lipservice to this rate design feature. The NGSA petition (Appendix A, page2) indicates that the following major pipelines did not then have seasonalrates:<ITAG tagnum="21">ANR, Columbia, Columbia Gulf, Consolidated, El Paso, Natural, Northern,Northwest, Panhandle, Southern (filed, but rejected), Tennessee, TexasEastern, Transco, Transwestern, Trunkline, and United.</ITAG>Today, most, if not all, of those pipelines still do not have seasonalrates in place, although there has been some increased interest by somepipelines in various statements or filings. On balance, it is still clearthat pipelines are still objecting to this aspect of 284.7.B. RecommendationModify the order to make clear that there is at least a presumption insupport of seasonally differentiated rates. On page 9, add the followingsentence at the end of the first paragraph under ``1. Annual Versus SeasonalRates.''``The Commission, therefore, concludes that seasonally differentiated ratesgenerally should be adopted, unless the pipeline can demonstrate that exceptionalcircumstances exist which justify some deviation from fully senasonallydifferentiated rates. Where such deviation can be justified on an individualpipeline basis, the pipeline nevertheless would be expected to satisfythe stated objectives of section 284.7 in the context of the deviation.''Also, modify the second sentence of the next paragraph to remove the apparentambiguity or ``wishy-washiness,'' as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Instead of ``If seasonal rates are warranted * * *,'' modify to read,``For seasonal rates required unless there is a justified deviation, costincurred * * *''</ITAG>5. <T3>Demand and Commodity Charges</T3>A. Comment<ITAG tagnum="81">As discussed at the May 17 meeting, I remain concerned that, whilewe have questioned whether the Modified Fixed Variable Method (MFV) maybe outdated, we have not been specific enough as to our general directionto provide any meaningful guidance to the parties. Although we honestlymay not have a specific result in mind, we should do more than just raisethe question alone as the issue in the cases. It is not enough to say (1)that most pipelines today are transporters (since only 10% of CD has beenconverted to F.T. and the vast bulk of transportation is I.T.) or (2) thatthe intended beneficiaries, the low load factor customers, have objectedin some cases to the application of MFV. I recommend we stake out at leastan opening position for purposes of an analytical point of departure inthe industry-wide reconsideration of MFV.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Recommendation</ITAG>On page 11, before subparagraph ``b. <T3>The Central Question,''</T3> insert the following additional discussion:<ITAG tagnum="21">In particular, the Commission is concerned that in today's naturalgas market the MFV two-part demand charge has the effect of shifting costsof pipeline capacity to off-peak usage with rates for firm capacity largelyunrelated to the value and true cost of the rendered service. The resultcan effectively insulate the firm customer from the true fixed costs ofthe firm service, such that the rates may provide an incentive for theuneconomic retention or ``hoarding'' of firm capacity rights leading toa major impediment to the availability of firm, rather than interruptible,service. A shift away from the MFV two-part demand charge, with a morereasonable balance in the assignment of fixed costs, could provide a greaterincentive for customers to reserve only capacity rights actually needed.Such a shift also could prevent situations where firm customers are ableto understate D-2 volumes and maintain a firm claim on pipeline capacityby paying relatively modest demand charges, by comparison to the real valueof the firm service. (Cite to the <T3>Tennessee, et al.</T3> line of cases on D-2 nominations). One possibleapproach to respond to these concerns would be a return to the straight,as opposed to modified, fixed-variable allocation and rate design methodology.Other methodologies might conceivably address these concerns. However specificallyresolved and addressed, the Commission intends that future demand and commoditycharge allocation methodology should affirmatively remove any incentivefor the uneconomic ``hoarding'' of firm capacity rights and otherwise ensurethat demand costs are fairly allocated to customers on the basis of theirrespective contract demand.</ITAG>6. <T3>Capacity Adjustments</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment</ITAG>The concept of CD reduction has been added to the order on page 12, butonly in a fleeting way. Some embellishment should be added to ensure thatthere is no ambiguity about the message.B. RecommendationInsert the following after the new sentence (first full one) on page 12:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission believes that the use of contract demand conversionwithout contract demand reduction would not support any significant shiftingof costs to peak service, because the firm customer would not have a reasonableopportunity to adjust the total firm requirements to reflect current needsand reallocated costs. Additionally, in light of the Commission's intentionto remove any identified incentive for firm capacity hoarding and any disincentiveto a more economically rational contract demand requirement, contract demandreduction probably is a necessary feature of an adjustment mechanism toprovide firm customers with the capability to develop a reasonable firmand interruptible service portfolio as necessary to meet current and projectedrequirements over time.</ITAG>7. Discounting<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment</ITAG>The order addresses the issue of discounting in a manner that appears tobe clearly ``results oriented,'' to the effect that there can be <T3>``no disincentive''</T3> to pipelines providing transportation ratediscounts. I discussed the issue at the May 17 meeting and continue tobelieve that the order goes too far. The order effectively gives the pipelinesa blank check in its current form, even though the clear intent of OrderNo. 436 was directly contrary to that result. Ironically, I would guessthat at least 50% or more of the current transportation volumes on mostpipelines (which nationwide approximate 75% of total throughput) are withdiscounted rates, because of competition in the marketplace. That's onepart of Order No. 436 which has worked reasonably well and it is absurdin the extreme to conclude that current rate treatment is such a disincentivethat pipelines must have a blank check, lest they discontinue discounting.Discounting will only be limited or ceased when, and only to the extentthat, a pipeline has a competitively advantageous position to allow itto maintain maximum throughput levels at incrementally higher or maximumrates. The Commission must not open the door to understated volumes and,as a result, higher unit rates on such a flimsy analytical and evidentiarybasis. To date, in fact, we have had only two related cases on this issue.Discounting is going to continue as a matter of competitive necessity,if not survival, in today's natural gas market. But, that is not a reasonto invite the misallocation of costs that inevitably would result fromthis proposal. We already are confronted with the reality that selectivediscounting probably provides one of the greatest opportunities for affiliatepreferences, which we must address in Order No. 497-A. I see no reasonto further compound the discounting problem with potential cross-subsidiesand needlessly higher transportation rates for non-affiliated shippers.As noted, this issue has recurred directly in two specific cases worthsome attention. In <T3>CNG Transmission Corporation, </T3>44 FERC andpara; 61,203 (1988), Thepipeline included as a credit to its cost of service $9 million in revenuesrelated to transportation services of 35.5 million dt. The rate proposedto be charged for the transactions was significantly below CNG's proposedgenerally applicable transportation rate. The Commission rejected CNG'sproposal stating that the pipeline ``was shifting the cost burden of itstransportation discounts from the company to other transportation customers,''``regulations promulgated under Order No. 436 were designed to preventsuch cross-subsidization,'' and ``CNG would have a competitive advantageover pipelines that are bearing (such cost burden) responsibility.'' TheCommission took the same position in <T3>Questar Pipeline Company, </T3>43 FERC andpara; 61,127 (1988), but subsequentlyin its Order Granting In Part Appeal of Staff Action of February 1, 1989,with regard to the compliance filing in the same docket (46 FERC andpara;61,115 (1989)) decided not to summarily reject a revision of the throughputprojection, but rather made reasonableness of the projection an issue inthe pending hearing. At the same time, the Commission reiterated the generalview that led to the original rejection, and distinguished the revisedthroughput projection in the compliance filing on the narrow basis thatit was arguably consistent with the Commission's prior order, even thoughit may later prove to be inaccurate or otherwise produce unlawful rates.It is unambiguously clear, therefore, that the Commission's interpretationof Order No. 436 and its consistent practice until today is directly contraryto the plain meaning and obvious result of this section of the policy statement.While there may be a legitimate question of how to properly allocate historical,discounted volumes in calculating new transportation rates, several keyprinciples of Order No. 436 remain relevant and applicable. First, thepipeline must remain at risk without question for the revenue results ofdiscounting under any given rate structure, including any under-recovery.Second, there cannot be any cross-subsidy of the discounts by rates forother services. The current draft clearly ``finesses,'' if not practicallyrepeals, andSection; 284.7(c)(3), and those key principles of Order No. 436in the discussion, particularly paragraphs 2 and 3 on page 15 of the slipopinion. Also, although the text makes specific reference to Order No.497, the strong impression of the discussion is that there should be no<T3>regulatory </T3>(rate or otherwise) disincentive or impediment to otherwiseunconstrained pipeline flexibility to engage in selective discounting foraffiliated and non-affiliated shippers. Additionally, all calculationsusing past discounted volumes must take into account and properly balance/reflectthe extent to which such volumes were discounted for affiliated shippers.I also am quite concerned that this feature of the policy statement isintended to lay the ratemaking foundation for the Incentive Rate of Returninitiative and also the so called ``productivity gain'' concept. For allthese reasons, I would modify it.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Recommendation </ITAG>Modify the discussion to ``neutralize'' the statement of the problem <T3>and</T3> the Commission's response to make clear that the principlesof Order No. 436 (as well as Order No. 497) will continue to apply, evenwhere there may be a demonstrated need for some flexibility on throughputcalculation and the effect of discounted volumes. Remove the ``resultsoriented'' discussion and examples memorializing support for cross-subsidiesand reduced/eliminated pipeline risk of underrecovery due to discounting,such as under the benefit sharing approach. Require that all calculationsof past approach. Require that all calculations of past discounted volumestake into account and properly reflect/balance the extent to which suchvolumes were discounted for affiliated shippers. (See Appendix for a proposedmodified discussion). What evidence (<T3>e.g.,</T3> <T3>CNG</T3>, <T3>Questar</T3>, the 1988 INGAA report, etc.) exists to support the conclusionthat this may be a real world problem which, in fact, requires some genericpolicy response from the Commission? The current discussion provides noevidentiary or experiential antecedent to the extensive discussion. Ineffect, what is the need for any attention to discounting in this policystatement in the first place? 8. Maximum Interruptible Rates <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment</ITAG>The discussion of the 100% load factor method in the order appears to bea retreat from the Commission's most recent pronouncements. The betterresult would be to establish the general presumption that, all other thingsbeing equal, the Commission believes that the current usage of 100% loadfactor probably is inconsistent today with the reasonable and fair allocationof costs to shippers. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Recommendation </ITAG>On page 17, insert a new sentence after the first sentence of text, asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Based on its review to date, the Commission believes that generallythe 100% load factor in current practice probably does not result in areasonable and fair allocation of costs to shippers, in the absence ofother compensating and offsetting adjustments, and today is not consistentwith the stated rate objectives of Order No. 436.</ITAG>9. Mileage-based Rates <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment</ITAG>The order again appears to retreat from the clear intent of Order No. 436that rates be mileage based, unless there is an adequate justificationfor the departure. The NGSA petition, Appendix A, page 7, indicates that10 major pipelines have implemented large zones approximating postage stamprates (ANR, Columbia Gulf, El Paso, Natural, Northern, Panhandle, Southern,Transwestern, Trunkline, and United), three others have postage stamp rates(Columbia, Consolidated, and Northwest), and three others have four ormore zones (Tennessee, Texas Eastern, Transco). For example, the issuewill recur again in cases on the next agenda, with results that are inconsistentwith Order No. 436. The point is that the Commission's failure to expresslysupport this requirement of andSection; 284.7 is tantamount to acquiescencein its continued avoidance by pipelines in cases and settlements. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Recommendation </ITAG>Insert a new paragraph after the text ending with footnote 55 on page 19.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission emphasizes that Order No. 436 intends that rates bereflective of the distance gas is transported. Thus, pipelines generallyshould implement rates which do not constitute ``postage stamp'' rateswhere shippers pay the same charge whether the gas travels one mile ora hundred miles or more. That form of rate discourages alternative andmore economically efficient transportation and market approaches, whereasrates based on mileage or small zones will foster competition and encouragethe use of the most economically efficient alternative path to market.Thus, a pipeline is required to justify any deviation from rates whichdirectly reflect differences in the distance of the transportation service.</ITAG>10. <T3>Separating Services</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment</ITAG>The new section on page 20 is an improvement over the original draft, whichwas virtually silent on unbundling. The discussion, however, is too understatedin its current form and, thereby, suggests that the Commission is not totallycommitted to pursuing the unbundling objective clearly established in OrderNo. 436. The NGSA petition documents the fact that a significant numberof pipelines have not unbundled storage costs, gathering and third partytransportation costs (Account No. 858). The issue also comes up repeatedlyin pending cases and this would be a timely opportunity to express theCommission's view in support of further unbundling. Also, we should makeclear the importance of (1) FT equivalency and (2) the less restrictedavailability of storage, as we did in the recent <T3>Transco </T3>and <T3>Tennessee </T3>GIC ``paper hearing'' orders.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Recommendation</ITAG>In the new paragraph on page 20, modify the sentence beginning, ``Thisdoes not mean * * *.'' to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">This does not mean in every case that a bundled rate is necessarilyinappropriate. However, the Commission reiterates here the clear objectiveof Order No. 436 that rates be unbundled for separate services, and costsbe allocated fairly to those services. That general result will betterensure that there will be a more efficient use of the pipeline's facilities,that competition of a gas to gas nature will be on a more equal basis,and that the allocation of costs will reflect better the economic valueof the services. For example, as a general matter, unbundled rates forgathering, treating, processing, storage, and transmission services willbest reflect costs associated with each service and the value of the serviceto customers. Also, transportation rates generally should not include AccountNo. 858 costs related to transportation of system supply gas on upstreamthird party pipelines, since those costs are related solely to the salesservice and are incurred only when the pipeline purchases gas for its salesto customers. Similarly, the Commission, as a general matter, has concludedthat the transmission element of (1) a pipeline's sales service and (2)its firm transportation service should be functionally equivalent withcomparable rate (cite to <T3>Transco/Tennessee</T3>). And, the pipeline should not unjustifiablyrestrict access to separate storage services provided with appropriatelyunbundled rates. Thus, the Commission has concluded generally that, unlessotherwise justified in a particular rate case applicable to an individualpipeline, Order No. 436 requires pipelines to proceed now to develop rateswhich reflect this concept of unbundling.</ITAG>11. Theory-Economic Efficiency<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Comment</ITAG>My view on the over-emphasis on economic efficiency in the earlier draftwas discussed at the May 17, 1989 Commission Meeting. Suffice it to saythat I remain very concerned that there is an over-emphasis on the theoryand the so-called ``Commission goal'' of allocating capacity (and by inference,other services) to those who value it the highest. That leads potentiallyto such ill-starred and analytically deceased initiatives as ``auctioning''all transmission capacity, for which we have two consultant reports servingas an academic obituary, and the capacity brokering NOPR, where the stafftechnical conference proved that we could not, as a threshold matter, definethe ``right'' to be brokered in the first instance, thus constituting a<T3>de facto</T3> funeral for the generic initiative. I would not wantthis ``economic efficiency theory'' discussion to serve as the Phoenixresurrecting those largely decomposed concepts from the well-deserved ranksof the analytical dead.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Recommendation</ITAG>Interested parties should consider carefully the potential negative implicationsof this primacy of economic efficiency approach, in terms of today's transportationactivities and considerations of equity, fairness and non-discrimination.12. Order No. 497-AAs the preceding discussion makes abundantly clear, this Policy Statementwould increase materially the concerns associated with undue discriminationagainst non-affiliates and preference for affiliates. The remedy for thatincreased concern lies in immediate and acceptable action on the rehearingof Order No. 497 including, but certainly not limited to, an extensionof the reporting requirement for several years beyond December 31, 1989.We, therefore, should adopt the Policy Statement only if final and favorableaction on Order No. 497-A is scheduled promptly.13. ConclusionThese comments and recommendations are intended to facilitate with specificproposals the improvement of the overall posture of this Policy Statement,in terms of the degree of guidance provided to the parties in these casesand the industry at large. This policy statement provides us with a timelyand effective opportunity to redirect pipeline rate design in a much moremarket-oriented and competitive direction this year. I look forward toreviewing these recommendations further on rehearing. In the end, I hopewe can reach agreement to strengthen the guidance along these lines.For these reasons, I concur.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles A. Trabandt,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Commissioner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix_Proposed Modified Discussion</ITAG>4. Discounting and MaximumInterruptible Rates<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Discounting</ITAG>Section 284.7(d) requires a pipeline to file maximum and minimum transportationrates for both firm and interruptible service and permits the pipelineto charge rates to customers within the maximum and minimum range. Underthis section a pipeline is permitted to discount in order to maximize throughputand thereby benefit customers by spreading fixed cost recovery over moreunits of service. Section 284.7(c)(3) states the rate objective that ``[t]hepipeline's revenue requirement allocated to firm and interruptible servicesshould be attained by providing the projected units of service in peakand off-peak periods at the maximum rate for each service.'' \44\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ A pipeline's projected units of service may only be changedby the pipeline in a section 4 rate filing. The projected units of serviceconcept involves giving pipelines an incentive to maximize throughput.Selective discounting furthers similar objectives, by allowing pipelinesto retain and attract business by meeting competition. Order No. 436, <T3>supra</T3> n. 1 at p. 31,546; Order No. 436-A, [Reg. Preambles 1982-1985]FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara; 30,675 at p. 31,679 (1985).Many have read this requirement to mean that a pipeline must assume infiling its next rate case that the volumes it has transported at discountedrates would still be transported if the maximum rate were charged. In lightof the competitive market that has emerged in the gas industry, this assumptionis not necessarily a realistic one in every case. Also, it may discouragesome pipelines under certain circumstances from discounting their servicesto some extent in the future to capture marginal firm and interruptiblebusiness.That would occur because the pipeline arguably might not be able to recoverits cost-of-service, if the maximum rates are based on the exact throughputachieved by discounting, without any adjustment to reflect the impact ofdiscounts on total throughput. The court in <T3>Associated Gas Distributors</T3> v. <T3>FERC</T3> described this situation and stated that there was no reasonto suppose that the Commission intended for a pipeline to calculate pricesassuming the carriage of discounted traffic at a fully allocated price.\45\<NOTE/> The objective set forth in andSection; 284.7(c)(3) was designedto prevent subsidization of the discounts by the pipelines' non-discountedrates.\46\<NOTE/> However, that objective also should take into account OrderNo. 436's goal of maximizing throughput. Therefore, the Commission willallow parties to develop a record on and explore ways to calculate a pipeline'srates after it has been discounting so as to achieve both objectives asset out in the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ 824 F.2d 981, 1012 (D.C. Cir. 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>See</T3> Order No. 436, <T3>supra</T3> n. 1 at p. 31,545.At the outset, however, the Commission reiterates that pipelines must givediscounts on a non-discriminatory basis, and the Commission is concernedabout selective discounts that have the potential for giving rise to unduediscrimination, including discounts to affiliates.\47\ The following discussionabout how to design the rates does not alter the standards that apply tothe Commission's review of a pipeline's decision as to when and how todiscount. That is, discounts must be given on a non-discriminatory basis,and discounts to affiliates will be carefully scrutinized,\48\ as willbe the treatment of past discounts to affiliates in projecting future unitsof service.While the Commission will consider some flexibility under andSection; 284.7(c)in terms of adjustments to reflect the impact of discounts (particulardiscounts for non-affiliated shippers) on total throughput, the Commissionemphasizes that there should be no cross-subsidization by sales customersor shippers at maximum rates. And, the pipeline in large measure must stillbear the risk of underrecovery as a result of <T3>future</T3> discounts under the <T3>new</T3> maximum rate. Finally, the calculations using past discountedvolumes must take into account and properly balance the extent of suchvolumes discounted for affiliated shippers.The Commission also recognizes that in a rate case it may be difficultto forecast discounted units of service at particular prices in order toallocate costs to discounted service. For example, discounts may dependon variables, such as the prices of alternative fuels. Accordingly, theALJs and participants should consider methods which deal with the problemof the difficulty in forecasting revenues from discounting.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-13479 Filed 6-6-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6717-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
