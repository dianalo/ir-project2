Ms. Phillips, 44 years old, is currently vice presidentfor finance and professor of finance at the University ofIowa. She chaired the Commodity Futures Trading Commissionduring the Reagan administration.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Phillips hasn't said much -- in public at least --about her approach to monetary policy. If confirmed by theSenate, she is expected to be an important voice, along withFed Vice Chairman David Mullins, in financial-marketregulatory matters. While at the CFTC, she sought to limitgovernment regulation of financial markets and was a strongsupporter of developing the market for stock-index futures,over which Congress may soon give the Fed more jurisdiction.   Ms. Phillips would serve the unexpired term of MarthaSeger, who resigned in March. That term extends to 1998.   Although confirmation of Fed nominees normally isn'tcontentious, Mr. Bush's other nomination to the Fed board isstalled in the Senate. The president nominated LawrenceLindsey, a White House economist, to the board in January;the Senate Banking Committee, with some opposition, clearedthe nomination in August.   But Mr. Lindsey has run into opposition from someDemocrats, particularly North Carolina Sen. Terry Sanford. Itisn't clear when Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ofMaine will schedule a Senate vote on the nomination.   Also pending before the Senate is Mr. Bush's renominationof Alan Greenspan for another four-year term as Fed chairman,but the Senate Banking Committee may not consider that untilnext year because it currently is preoccupied with otherissues. Mr. Greenspan continues to serve as chairman pendingSenate action.</TEXT></DOC>
