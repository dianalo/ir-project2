But it is useful tokeep in mind that there as yet has been no really effectivecontrol applied to the terrorists who deprived the men oftheir freedom. Syria, a central player in thehostage-terrorism game for years, seems be enjoying a coat ofTeflon at the moment.   The two hostages released yesterday made their way home byway of Damascus, Syria's capital, which further strengthensthe idea that they were being delivered up by Syria itself,not by some shadowy presence in the Bekaa Valley that theSyrians have heretofore been unable to trace. So it might beconcluded that one way to get a Teflon coating is to takehostages.</LP><TEXT>   Getting on to even nastier things, there is the still-openquestion of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,Scotland, three years ago. Last week, the U.S. indicted twoLibyans for the crime and both the U.S. and Scotland haveissued warrants for their arrest. British and Americanofficials are discussing what action to take against Libya totry to force extradition. But what about Syria? One wonderswhether the Teflon coating is at work here again.   At any rate, two more hostages are free. Bargaining tofree the remaining prisoners will continue. We hope, however,that the bargainers and the world will bear in mind that nothanks are due regimes that release hostages. What is reallydue is effective action to discourage them from engagingfurther in this slimy form of international politics.</TEXT></DOC>
