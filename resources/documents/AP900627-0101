Thatwould not merely be a premature reward for inadequate economicreform; it might actually slow the process.   It is natural for the West Germans, flush with the world'slargest trade surplus, to wish to use this to political effect.Other Western politicians, too, may wish they could buy Mr.Gorbachev out of economic failure. Unfortunately, this is not anattainable objective. There are forms of assistance to which allshould agree. The Bush administration has shown itselfencouragingly ready to foster trade, and must now persuade Congressto agree. Subsidized American grain sales are not so different fromthe kind of food aid urged by some Europeans; a little may bepolitically useful. But large-scale subsidy would merely stunt theSoviet economy's feeble efforts to generate domestic production.Financial aid which merely reduced the Soviet Union's need to sellgold would be an incentive, not a cure, for domestic mismanagement.Investment, which is what the Soviet Union most needs, will comeonce a market economy exists.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 20   Il Messaggero, Rome, on Romania:   The recent repression and bloodshed in Bucharest reveal a newkind of post-Communist regime in Eastern Europe. Incorrectly, it isbeing called ``neo-communism.'' It is in fact something quitedifferent.   Neo-communism is the courageous attempt of a Mikhail Gorbachev,who, in the face of an incredibly difficult transition phase, ispoised to move the crisis-bound Soviet Union from Stalinism to truedemocratic socialism. Even if for now it is but a vision, thepossibility cannot be excluded that from so many failings, a new,liberal communism can be born.   The course of Iliescu in Romania is quite different. Here thereis no transition _ only restoration. Remember the words of ElenaCeausescu to her executioners: ``You are all my children.''   That ominous warning, broadcast on televisions around the world,weighs heavily on the heart. Another leopard reigns in the blood ofBucharest.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 21   Weltwoche, Zurich, Switzerland, on Soviet withdrawal of troopsfrom Germany:   Suppose the Soviet Union pulls its troops out of Germany. Notmuch imagination is needed to predict that on the day the lastSoviet soldier has left East Germany, the call will rise in WestGermany for the withdrawal of the Western troops. Already now,France and Britain do not dare to voice any reservations, and willnot be able to resist such demands. But the withdrawal of allforeign troops from Germany would mean the factual end of NATO,whether it is dissolved or not. Germany, because of its sheer size,thus would get a special status in Europe. One does not need toaccuse the West German politicians of seeking such status. But theyor their successors, swept to power by the new nationalism and thenew sense of greatness, will be inevitably pushed in thisdirection. ..The German special status will that be of a Europoeansuperpower and not that of a medium power restricted and limited byan (international) treaty.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 21   Mainichi Daily News, Tokyo, on the Mideast situation:   The Middle East situation is like a mirage. From time to timethe hope for lasting peace there appears, but all too soon fadesaway. At present the situation is going through a disappointingperiod.   Anticipation for peace was strong toward the end of 1988. Thatwas when the Palestine Liberation Organization proclaimed theestablishment of an independent Palestine state but, at the sametime, gave virtual recognition to the existence of Israel, andannounced the abandonment of terrorism. This led to the start ofdirect dialogue between the U.S. government and the PLO.   With the PLO's adoption of a realistic course and the U.S.government's restudy of its policy toward that group, many thoughtthat the bottleneck in the long search for peace had at last beenremoved. Eighteen months have passed since then, however, insteadof the prospect for peace becoming brighter, several eventsdarkening that prospect have taken place.   The killing of Palestinian workers in the outskirts of Tel Avivon May 20 by ``a mentally disturbed man'' led to protests and ageneral strike by Palestinians.   Then on May 30, armed groups believed to be members of a radicalPLO wing landed from speedboats at two bathing beaches near TelAviv. The raid was checked by Israeli troops, but the questionremains as to whether this was a violation of the PLO's pledge ``toabandon terrorism.''   If the U.S. government considers this to be a violation, thereis the possibility that the dialogue with the PLO will be halted orinterrupted temporarily. This would deliver a big blow to the peaceefforts. ...   At a time when there is little prospect for improvement of thesituation, all those concerned should endeavor not to make thesituation worse. Efforts should be made to mitigate mutualdistrust. Even the slightest careless action will increase thatdistrust.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 25   Le Monde, Paris, on the political repercussions of the Iranianearthquake:   This catastrophe could strengthen the arguments of PresidentRafsanjani and other Iranian leaders who want to end as rapidly aspossible the isolation which has forced the country to turn towardmoderate Arab countries and the West,   It remains to be seen if the door which has opened a crack underthese particularly sorrowful circumstances will close again whenthe emotions provoked by the earthquake have faded. Thepolitical-religious rhetoric, today relegated to secondaryimportance, might surface again in the face of the complex problemswhich must still be resolved in order to knock down the wall ofdefiance and mistrust which 10 years of pure, rigid Khomeini-ismhas built around the Islamic Republic.</TEXT><HEAD>End Editorial Rdp</HEAD></DOC>
