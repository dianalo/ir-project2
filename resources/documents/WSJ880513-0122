The study found enough gas could be tapped in the lower 48 states to meet current U.S. consumption levels for 35 years at wellhead costs of less than $3 per thousand cubic feet. If the price rose to between $3 and $5 per thousand cubic feet, another 10 years' of gas could be recovered, the study predicted.    The estimates are based on both proven reserves and undiscovered fields, though at a cost almost double the current market price for natural gas. New drilling would be required to tap most of the gas cited in the predictions.    Energy Secretary John Herrington said the study should lay to rest the &quot;misimpression&quot; created during a natural-gas shortage in the winter of 1976-77 &quot;that natural gas is an unreliable source. That is not the case,&quot; he told a news conference.    The natural-gas industry applauded the study for its &quot;positive&quot; finding of a plentiful supply of gas. The industry was upset in March by preliminary U.S. Geological Survey estimates that gave a pessimistic forecast of undiscovered gas resources.    A consumer-interest group, however, said the estimates were &quot;deceptive&quot; because they looked at how much gas could be tapped at $3 per thousand cubic feet, instead of a market price nearer the current level of about $1.85.    &quot;It isn't a very meaningful thing because they purposely, in my judgment, didn't look at a price of about $2,&quot; which would have lowered the estimate of recoverable gas, said Edwin Rothschild, assistant director of the Citizen/Labor Energy Coalition.    Mr. Herrington has argued before that the U.S., for energy security reasons, needs to turn to natural gas to curb its use of imported oil. The secretary said the study offers assurance that natural gas will be available at reasonable prices for new customers. He predicted natural gas could eventually replace as much as one million barrels of imported oil a day.    The natural-gas industry, like the Energy Department, is particularly interested in persuading electric utilities and other industries to use more natural gas. &quot;That's where the gas market is going to expand in the near term, and if we're going to curb demand for imported oil, it's in the utility and industrial sector,&quot; said Scott Campbell, director of the Energy Department's policy and planning office.    A confusing array of studies are in circulation giving varying estimates of proven and potential natural gas resources. The Energy Department study was based on a consensus of private and government energy experts.    Looking at all possible sources of natural gas reserves and resources, excluding Alaska, the study estimated there are 1,059 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that can be tapped with existing technology.    Some 800 trillion cubic feet are in &quot;conventional&quot; reservoirs, which can be extracted through wells without advanced and expensive technology. About 583 trillion cubic feet of gas, yielding 35 years of gas at current demand levels, can be extracted for less than $3 a thousand cubic feet. At between $3 and $5 a thousand cubic feet, an additional 174 trillion cubic feet, or 10 years of supply could be recovered, the study said.    In 1987, the U.S. consumed 16.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. </TEXT></DOC>
