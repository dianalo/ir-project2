There was no indication who was responsible for the shooting.Communist rebels operate in Davao City, 600 miles southeast ofManila.   But government troops have been on alert in the Davao areabecause of reports that military mutineers who tried to topplePresident Corazon Aquino earlier this month were planning attacksin the Davao area.   The mutineers were angered when U.S. warplanes flew air covermissions to support government forces Dec. 1, the first day of thefailed coup. Although they did not fire, the U.S. jets helped turnthe tide in the battle.   The military said Saturday that five private shooting clubsassociated with the son of Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, were involved inthe failed coup.   The Philippine Constabulary said about 100 civilian members ofthe clubs were identified through photographs and videotapes ashaving fought alongside military mutineers who launched the coupattempt.   The shooting clubs are part of the Philippine Tactical ShootingAssociation, an umbrella organization headed by Juan ``Jackie''Ponce Enrile Jr., son of the former defense minister and loneopposition member of the Senate, the constabulary said.   The statement did not specifically name the younger Enrile asamong those members taking part in the coup attempt.   The elder Enrile has denied involvement in the coup attempt,believed to have been led by a clique of officers associated withhim when he served as Mrs. Aquino's defense chief.   Enrile was fired in November 1986 after a failed coup by hisfollowers.</TEXT></DOC>
