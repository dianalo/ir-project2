Itoh Techno-Science Co. Ltd. (CTC), part ofthe leading international trading corporation, C. Itoh andamp; Co.andM;The announcement was made in Tokyo Nov. 9 and the system made its debut atthe Telemarketing Fair Tokyo '90 on Nov. 13-14.andM;The introduction culminates a year of intensive Voicelink customization andjoint development in preparation for the premier of Voicelink predictivedialing technology in Japan.andP;  &quot;This event marks just the beginning of apartnership and one of many new breakthroughs ahead as we work with Kawasakiand CTC to develop new applications and services to meet the needs ofJapanese business,&quot; said Michael Darland, president and chief executiveofficer of Digital Systems.andM;In addition to offering the system for direct sale, CTC is also establishinga telemarketing service bureau, giving Japanese companies the option topurchase a system outright or to use the services of a Voicelink callingcenter.andP;  A similar center operated by Digital Systems as part of its U.S.andO;operations quickly grew from seven to 325 workstations.andM;Under the agreement, Kawasaki Steel will modify the system for use in Japanand manufacture the system with components supplied by Digital Systems.andP;  CTC,considered a leading system integrator in Japan, will market, distribute andservice the system and handle any necessary customization.andM;Voicelink with Intelligent Dialing gives business immediate and economicaccess to customers by phone, while minimizing the labor expense associatedwith manual dialing.andP;  Leading U.S.andP;  companies in banking, finance,telecommunications, retail, healthcare and many other industries already usethe system for high-volume phone contact related to telemarketing,collections, customer service, fund raising and market research.andM;Kawasaki and CTC, both part of Japan's Dai-Ichi Kang Yo Bank Group (DKBGroup), Japan's third largest bank, are targeting Voicelink to the outboundtelemarketing and financial services industries for use in collections,sales, customer services and other innovative communications programs.andM;INDUSTRY GROWTH Membership in Japan's telemarketing association has grownfrom zero to 105 within a year and the trend is expected to continue.andO;Voicelink will bring the industry dramatic improvement in labor efficiency asa single operator can do the work of five in a manual dialing operation.andO;Because Voicelink automates the labor intensive functions such as dialing,screening out answering machines, busy signals, bad phone numbers and callswith no answers, operators can spend their time talking with as many as 50people an hour.andM;INCREASING LABOR SHORTAGE IN JAPAN &quot;In view of growing labor shortages,Voicelink represents a significant opportunity for major Japanese companiesto improve communication productivity and to lower operating costs,&quot; saidDarland.andP;  &quot;Lower costs and higher productivity are critical issues under sucheconomic conditions.&quot;andM;Digital Systems believes Japan offers the second largest market for automatedcall processing, with a population of 122 million, boasting 535 telephonesper 1,000 households.andP;  In addition to this large business-to-consumer market,a greater potential exists for business-to-business calls that need to bemade more efficiently and effectively.andM;Coupled with labor savings, Voicelink will also bring Japanese industry thesame rapid return on investment as U.S.andP;  companies report.andP;  &quot;Typically, laborsavings delivered by Voicelink combined with additional revenue generatedfrom added volume of contact, generates hard-dollar payback in six to eightmonths,&quot; explained Darland.andM;Founded in 1979, Digital Systems International Inc. provides integratedtelecommunications and database solutions that help companies increaseefficiency and profitability in their calling center through innovativeservices and systems.andP;  Digital Systems is headquartered in Redmond,Washington.andM;FACT SHEET WHAT IS VOICELINK? Voicelink is a highly sophisticated computersystem that substantially automates and synchronizes, in real time, the manycomplex functions required of an outbound calling operation.andM;In a manual outbound calling environment, operators spend time before eachcall reviewing paper records or computer terminal screens, selecting theperson to be called, locating the phone number, dialing the numbers andlistening to rings, phone company intercepts, busy signals and answeringmachines.andP;  Operators also spend time updating the customer's existing recordsafter each call.andM;Voicelink transforms this relatively high-cost (or cost-prohibitive),labor-intensive process to a lower-cost, labor-efficient automated process.andO;By screening out answering machines, busy signals, operator intercepts, etc.,andO;and recognizing a live voice, the system delivers the maximum number of humanconnections to a given operator pool.andP;  The result is productivity increasesof up to 300 to 600 percent.andM;The system incorporates complex algorithms that consider, in real time, thenumber of available telephone lines, the number of available operators, theprobability of getting no answer, a busy signal, a disconnected number or ananswering machine, the time between calls required for maximum operatorefficiency, the length of an average conversation, and the average length oftime the operator requires to enter relevant data.andP;  Voicelink constantlyadjusts the dialing rate by monitoring the changes in all of these factors.andM;HOW VOICELINK WORKS In order to begin calling, Voicelink must haveinformation, known as a calling list, from a host computer.andP;  This informationmay be directly downloaded from the host to Voicelink automatically or may bedownloaded via magnetic tape.andP;  The system then identifies and organizes thisinformation (records) into discrete calling programs based on any informationthat is stored in the host record.andM;Operator terminals, called workstations, are directly connected to theVoicelink and may also be directly connected to the host computer system sothat operators may update the host database in real time as they're talkingwith the called party.andM;An integral part of the Voicelink workstations are operator headsets or phoneconnections.andP;  When Voicelink detects a live voice after placing a call, thesystem simultaneously transfers the call to an available operator's headsetor phone station, and the relevant database information about the calledparty to the operator's terminal.andP;  During and after the phone conversation,the operator may update the database information directly on the Voicelinksystem or use a simple keystroke to switch to the host database to makereal-time updates.andM;At the end of a calling day, the calling list and database information may beuploaded back to the host computer system and a new calling list retrieved.andM;Voicelink provides detail management reports on the state of the calling listbefore, during and after the calling jobs.andP;  These reports provide informationon program and operator performance, enabling the user to make immediateadjustments in his or her calling strategy to optimize productivity.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
