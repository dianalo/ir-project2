This rule amends a number of Export ControlCommodity Numbers in the CCL and the technical data provisions of part779 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 768 through799). Changes in the list represent a comprehensive review by COCOM ofa quarter of the list. Certain entries have been rewritten for clarity,and some commodities have been relocated to different entries. A few itemsnot previously subject to national security control have been added (e.g.,titanium diboride). Most of the changes represent partial or total decontrolof entries.This rule amends 15 CFR part 779, Supplement No. 3 to part 779, SupplementNo. 4 to part 779, and a number of Export Control Commodity Numbers onthe CCL in Commodity Group 4 (Transportation Equipment), Commodity Group5 (Electronics and Precision Instruments), Commodity Group 6 (Metals, Minerals,and Their Manufacturers) and Commodity Group 7 (Chemicals, Metalloids,Petroleum Products and Related Materials). This rule also amends the licensingrequirements for technical data related to these commodities. In addition,this rule removes three ECCNs: In Commodity Group 1 (Chemical and PetroleumEquipment), ECCN 1142A; in Commodity Group 4 (Transportation Equipment),ECCN 2418A; in Commodity Group 5 (Electronics and Precision Instruments),ECCN 1505A; and in Commodity Group 5 (Electronics and Precision Instruments),ECCN 1560A. Commodities covered in ECCN 1142A have been transferred toECCN 1754A. Commodities covered in ECCN 2418A have been transferred toECCN 1418A. With the concurrence of the Departments of State and Defense,the Department of Commerce has determined that this rule is consistentwith the U.S. national security provisions of section 5 of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979, as amended.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective October 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For questions of a technical natureon transportation equipment, call Bruce Webb, Office of Technology andPolicy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, telephone: (202) 377-3806.For questions of a technical nature on semiconductor manufacturing equipment,call Robert Anstead, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau ofExport Administration, telephone: (202) 377-1641.For questions of a technical nature on communications equipment, call JosephWestlake, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,telephone: (202) 377-0730.For questions of a technical nature on chemicals, metalloids, petroleumproducts and related materials, call Jeff Tripp, Office of Technology andPolicy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, telephone: (202) 377-1309.For questions of a technical nature on software covered in Supplement 3to part 779, call Randy Williams, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis,Bureau of Export Administration, telephone: (202) 377-0708.For general inquiries, call Kathryn Sullivan, Regulations Branch, Officeof Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, telephone:(202) 377-4479.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These collections have been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005, 0694-0007 and 0694-0010.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section 13(b) of theEAA does not require that this rule be published in proposed form becausethis rule implements regulatory changes based on COCOM review.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form.
