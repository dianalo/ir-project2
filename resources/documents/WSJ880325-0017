Sues Nofziger, Associate For Lobbying Funds </HL><SO> </SO><IN> BCY ARO </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wedtech Corp. sued Lyn Nofziger, former White House political director, and an associate for $900,000 they collected from the company in return for lobbying activities.    In February, Mr. Nofziger was found guilty of seeking to obtain contracts for the Bronx, N.Y.-based defense contracting firm by lobbying Edwin Meese, then-counselor to President Reagan; John Marsh Jr., then-secretary of the Army; and James C. Saunders, then-administrator of the Small Business Administration. Mr. Nofziger's associate, Mark A. Bragg, who was indicted for similar activities, was acquitted.    The complaint was filed in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, where Wedtech has had creditor protection, under Chapter 11, since December 1986. In the suit, Wedtech charged that the Army had in 1979 opposed awarding Wedtech an engine contract, because it thought Wedtech incapable of completing the project and the firm's bid too high.    Because of Mr. Nofziger's lobbying efforts, however, the contract was awarded in September 1982. According to the suit, &quot;the Army's assessment of Wedtech's capabilities did, however, prove to be correct.&quot; Wedtech was unable to complete the contract, and owes the U.S. between $5 million and $10 million for progress payments it received for work never completed, the suit said.    A counsel for the lobbying firm of Mr. Bragg and Mr. Nofziger said, &quot;Since Wedtech's counsel chose to issue a press release without even letting us know they were filing the complaint, I can't give you a substantive comment, since I haven't seen the complaint.&quot;    Wedtech said that of the $900,000 it seeks from Messrs. Nofziger and Bragg, about one-third represents cash payments made to the two men. The rest represents proceeds from the sale of Wedtech stock the two men allegedly sold. The suit says that Wedtech had given the men stock in the company for &quot;services rendered.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
