Gorbachevhave not gone far enough to cure an ailing economy or bringdemocracy.   The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner flew to Italy on Saturday withhis wife, Yelena Bonner, to speak at an Italian Socialist Partycongress in the northern city of Milan.   Sakharov, who was recently elected to the new Soviet parliament,said that while Gorbachev's reforms were ``moving in the rightdirection'' in foreign affairs, ``there are many aspects that arecausing profound distress.''   ``Economic reforms go ever more slowly and the people are losinginterest in their work because they can't buy anything,'' he said.   He said the stagnation was occurring because the governmentdismantled old bureaucratic structures but has not created new ones.   The 67-year-old physicist criticized Gorbachev for emergencymeasures he had taken to limit demonstrations in the wake ofnationalist uprisings.   ``We are in a blind alley, and there have been various politicaldecisions taken lately which I will not hesitate to define asanti-democratic,'' he said.   Sakharov was detained for nearly seven years in the northerncity of Gorky after he criticized the Soviets' 1979 militaryintervention in Afghanistan.</TEXT></DOC>
