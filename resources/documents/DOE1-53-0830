The illustrations relate to transfer ofmany useful genes for resistance to rusts and pest from alien sourcesto Triticum aestivum. Popular wheats have been rectified for resistanceto rusts mostly without any negative effects on yield potential. Themutation approach has also been successful in the development of multilines.Multiline constituting mutant components conferring simultaneous resistanceto more than one rust pathogen has an additional value. The use of inducedmutagenesis in breaking linkage between the genes conferring resistanceand other genes for undesirable characters has been described. New diseaseresistant mutant variations with additional changes of positive effecthave been obtained for practical utilization with widening the geneticbase of future breeding programmes.
