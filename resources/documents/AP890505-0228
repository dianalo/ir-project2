(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Alexander Mogilny, the first member of theSoviet National Team to defect to the West, arrived Friday night inBuffalo, where he hopes to continue his hockey career with theNHL's Buffalo Sabres.   Sabres General Manager Gerry Meehan accompanied Mogilny fromStockholm, Sweden, after the budding Soviet star decided to defectfollowing the World Hockey Championships, which ended earlier thisweek.   Mogilny, regarded as one of the Soviets' future stars, wassupposed to appear at a news conference called by the Sabres, butMeehan said the 20-year-old winger was tired from the trip andinterviews with immigration officials.   ``His day has been so tiring, we didn't want to put him throughanother exhausting round of exposure,'' said Meehan, who declinedto say where Mogilny was staying.   Meehan also denied an accusation by the official Soviet newsagency Tass that the Sabres were guilty of ``piracy'' in bringingMogilny to the United States.   ``The Buffalo Sabres were totally open and above-board'' indealing with Mogilny, he said. The Sabres began talks with Mogilny``at the specific request of the player,'' Meehan said. ``It was avoluntary departure.''   Meehan would not say whether Mogilny had signed a contract andalso declined comment on published reports that indicated aromantic relationship with an American woman may have been involvedin the defection.   Meehan admitted there are potential problems with internationalice hockey officials, the NHL and American immigration officialsthat could keep Mogilny from playing for Buffalo.   ``I wouldn't say they (his chances of playing with Buffalo) arepretty good or pretty bad,'' he said ``There are hurdles that haveto be resolved.''   Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov said the defection cast a shadowover attempts by other Soviet players to sign with NHL teams.   Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov said he was disgusted by thedefection and said it cast a shadow over attempts by other Soviethockey players to sign with NHL teams.   Vyacheslav Koloskov, head of the soccer and hockey department ofthe State Sports Committee, said in an interview published Fridayin the government daily Izvestia he expected no seriousrepercussions in Soviet-NHL relations.   Mogilny was accompanied on the flight from Stockholm by Meehanand Don Luce, the Sabres' director of amateur development.   Upon his arrival, Mogilny, who was a member of the Central RedArmy team, was interviewed at the airport by the FBI. ``They dothat with all defectors,'' said Tom Middlemiss, of the PortAuthority of New York andamp; New Jersey.   Meehan said Mogilny first contacted the Sabres by phone onTuesday, then met with Meehan and Luce in Sweden the following day.   ``I had no idea he wanted to come on Tuesday. It happened veryfortuitively,'' he said. He said the Sabres did not contact the NHLbefore meeting with Mogilny.   Meehan said many details, including presumbly Mogilny's statusas a Soviet defector, had to be worked out, but he said there wasplenty of time, since the start of the next NHL season is fivemonths away.   ``We hope he'll be able to play next year,''he said.   Meehan refused to discuss any details about a contract orMogilny's status with immigration or whether he had been grantedasylum.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Mogilny, who helped the SovietUnion to its 21st world hockey title last week, was granted a U.S.visa on Thursday.   Mogilny was in his third year with the Red Army team and played11 international matches with the Soviet national team before thisseason. He was voted the world's best junior player by NHL scoutsin a poll organized by The Hockey News.   But the right wing had his troubles with Soviet hockeyauthorities. He was suspended for 10 days before the worldchampionships after a fight in a Soviet league game.   A Swedish newspaper reported last week that Mogilny had amonth's salary withdrawn and lost his ``Master of Sports'' order.   He was also quoted by Aftonbladet newspaper as saying he was notinterested in a military career. ``I want to do something else withmy life,'' he was quoted as saying.   Mogilny's role as a junior lieutenant in the Soviet Army added afurther diplomatic complication. Soviet authorities could view theincident as desertion.</TEXT></DOC>
