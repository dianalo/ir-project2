As part of the agreement, two New Zealand companies, theFreightways Holdings Ltd. conglomerate and Fay, RichwhiteHoldings Ltd. merchant bank, will buy a stake of less than 1%in Telecom that will increase to 10% in the next three years.During the same period, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech willreduce their combined stake to 49.9% by making a series ofpublic stock offerings in New Zealand, Britain and the U.S.,beginning as early as 1991.</LP><TEXT>   The joint purchase represents an overseas coup for the tworegional Bell telephone companies, both of which view themove as a strategic opportunity. In winning Telecom, theyoutbid several U.S., Australian and New Zealand rivals,including a joint venture of Southwestern Bell Corp. and OTCLtd., an Australian long-distance telephone company; Cable andamp;Wireless PLC, a giant British company that owns Hong KongTelecom, among other businesses; Brierley Investments Ltd., aNew Zealand investment firm with stakes in several U.S.industrial companies; and Fletcher Challenge, a buildingproducts and timber concern that is New Zealand's largestcompany.   Last year, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic bid togetherunsuccessfully for a lucrative license to build and operateWest Germany's first private cellular-phone system. Their bidcame very close, and insiders say the bond of mutualallegiance they forged during that experience endured. Whenthe New Zealand system was put on the auction block in March,they quietly teamed up again.   Both companies, like other regional Bells, have sought toexpand beyond their service territories. Both also have beensitting on piles of cash. At the end of last year, Ameritechhad cash of $520.2 million; Bell Atlantic had $164.2 million.   The Telecom auction was managed for the New Zealandgovernment by CS First Boston Group, a New York investmentbanking firm, and the New Zealand firm of Buttle Wilson Ltd.The sale process was substantially completed last night whenthe agreement was approved by the New Zealand cabinet andsigned by company and government representatives.   News of the award wasn't announced last night until about10 p.m. New York time. In composite trading yesterday on theNew York Stock Exchange, Ameritech shares closed at $65, down25 cents; Bell Atlantic closed at $52.375, also down 25cents.   New Zealand decided to sell Telecom Corp. as part of anasset-sale program to raise funds to repay debt. Thegovernment will keep a special-rights preference share,locally nicknamed the &quot;Kiwi share,&quot; that will enable it toinfluence Telecom's future ownership structure and ensurethat the new owners don't cut telephone service or raiseprices by more than the country's inflation rate.   Earlier this year, New Zealand decided to open up thetelecommunications market to competition. Already a group ofcompanies including MCI Communications Corp. and Bell CanadaEnterprises Inc. have announced plans to merge their NewZealand telecommunications ventures to position themselvesbetter to compete against the nation's telephone giant.   Telecom, with 16,500 employees, 1.1 million customers andabout 1.4 million access lines, represents an attractiveprize. Revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31 was about$1.3 billion. Profits, supressed somewhat by recent heavyspending to improve the network, totaled about $148 million.The company expects its network to be 90% digital by the endof this year.   For cautious Chicago-based Ameritech, the leastdiversified of the seven Bell companies, the New Zealand moveis a particularly bold one. Almost all of Ameritech's 1989revenue of $10.21 billion came from its five Bell operatingcompanies, directory publishing and cellular operations. Butmore recently, Ameritech has expressed determination to pushin new directions rather than risk falling behind itssiblings and other rivals.   In April, for example, William Weiss, Ameritech'schairman, told shareholders that his management would &quot;searchthroughout the world&quot; for the right expansion opportunities.   Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic could find differentadvantages in the venture. For instance, operating in NewZealand will help the company supplement efforts to providepremium-priced, high-margin services in the U.S. So far, itsoverseas diversification has concentrated on suchcustomer-based offerings as computer maintenance, softwareand systems integration.   At Bell Atlantic's annual meeting in April, Raymond Smith,chairman, said the company was looking at a wide range ofoverseas investments, from cellular and network businesses tosystems integration. &quot;It's a whole new world,&quot; he said, &quot;fullof promise and opportunity.&quot;   While the long-term rewards could be considerable, therisks in New Zealand may be somewhat tougher on Bell Atlanticthan its partner. Bell Atlantic already has significantlymore long-term debt than Ameritech, about $7.7 billioncompared with $5.1 billion, and its debt as a portion oftotal capital is 10 percentage points higher at 52.4%.   Despite the extra obstacles of operating overseas, theBells have been eager to expand abroad because the consentdecree that broke up the Bell System in 1984 restricts theirbusiness activities in the U.S. Under the decree, thecompanies can't provide the content of electronic informationservices.   They are forbidden to manufacture telecommunicationsequipment or offer long-distance services. Indeed, thelong-distance constraint has complicated the prospects forparticipation by the Bells in a number of privatizationprograms abroad, including New Zealand, Mexico and PuertoRico.   The sale is scheduled to close in mid-September. Beforebuying Telecom, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech must obtain awaiver of the consent decree for operating certainlong-distance telephone services such as the service betweenthe U.S. and New Zealand that Telecom currently controls.   The price paid by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech is to besplit evenly between the two companies. A total of 1.86billion New Zealand dollars will be paid in six equal monthlypayments, beginning at the closing of the acquisition; asingle payment of about $1.38 billion will be made at theclosing.   The Telecom sale will be the largest commercialtransaction in the history of New Zealand. The price ishigher than that received by the British government in its1985 privatization of British Telecom.</TEXT></DOC>
