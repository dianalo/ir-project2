A paper company wants to reopen a mill that until five years ago had been the largest employer in the town. But state officials say that discharge from the mill would make the Little Androscoggin River too hot in the summer for brook trout. The heated discharge won't kill the fish, officials admit, but &quot;it would result in an area in the river where the fish would avoid, which by law should be available to the fish.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
