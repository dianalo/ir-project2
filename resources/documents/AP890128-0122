A pro-Syrian Beirut newspaper reported without elaboration thatefforts to free foreign captives were making progress.   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, Foreign Minister FaroukAl-Sharaa told reporters Saturday ``there is nothing now'' whenasked about a hostage release.   He spoke after the arrival of Iranian Foreign Minister Ali AkbarVelayati for talks on fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militiasin Lebanon. Asked the same question, Velayati said:``I hope all thehostages will be released.''   McCabe, who is based in Iraq, told reporters at BeirutAirport,``I am here on behalf of my government to investigate rumors... about a possible early release of Mr. Brian Keenan.'' He added:``I don't know of any reasons which would make me particularlyhopeful.'' Keenan is a Belfast man with dual British and Irishnationality whose release is also sought by the British government.   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing inBeirut and believed to be held mostly by pro-Iranian groups. McCabesaid he would meet with diplomats and others who he was not preparedto identify.   The left-wing daily As-Safir said Saturday that ``spiritual andsecurity sources expect positive developments at the level ofreleasing some foreign captives held in Lebanon.'' It added that``high-level contacts in this regard took place in the past twoweeks,'' but it did not elaborate.   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio Friday described reportsof an imminent release as ``mere speculation based on rumors.''   Lebanese newspapers recently have published several reports aboutpossible releases of foreign captives. None has proved accurate.   As-Safir's report followed speculation in Beirut on Wednesdayabout the imminent release of Keenan and of British hostage JohnMcCarthy.   Keenan, 38, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 as he walked to theAmerican University of Beirut where he taught English. Six dayslater, McCarthy, 32, of Barnet, north London, was kidnapped as hedrove to Beirut Airport in the Moslem sector. He is a Britishtelevision journalist.   No group claimed their abductions.</TEXT></DOC>
