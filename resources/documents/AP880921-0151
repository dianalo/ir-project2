Officials in Azerbaijan's disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakhimposed a curfew and banned gatherings to cool ethnic passionsafter violence broke out Tuesday and Wednesday in and aroundStepanakert, the territory's largest city.   In Yerevan, capital of neighboring Armenia, officials rejected ademand by thousands of protesters for a new meeting of therepublic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, to renew a petition forannexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain enclave.   ``There are hundreds of thousands of people in front of theSupreme Soviet,'' said Arpenay Popoyan, wife of activist and formerpolitical prisoner Rafael Popoyan.   ``The city is very tense,'' she said in a telephone interviewfrom Yerevan. A general strike that began Sept. 16 continued.   Her husband said later by telephone that a governmentannouncement was read on Armenian television declaring such asession by the Supreme Soviet would be illegal and rejecting thedemand.   ``This answer is a violation of the constitution,'' said Popoyan.   He said by law a session must be held if one-third of theSupreme Soviet deputies request it, and he said more than one-thirdhave signed such a request.   The Soviet government Wednesday banned foreign journalists fromtraveling to Yerevan from Tbilisi, Georgia, for ``temporaryreasons.''   Tass said no one was injured in the disturbances inNagorno-Karabakh.   The gunfire and arson by ethnic rioters in Stepanakert andvicinity followed a gun battle Sunday in the nearby village ofKhadzhaly. One man died and at least 25 people were wounded.Activists also said a bomb exploded Monday at a dormitory forArmenian construction workers near Stepanakert.   ``All this created an alarming situation. Many residents in thecentral city of Stepanakert and rural regions are worried abouttheir safety,'' Tass said.   Tass did not say whether Armenians, Azerbaijanis or both werebehind the violence.   It said homes and cars were set afire in Nagorno-KarabakhTuesday night and Wednesday morning and that shots were heard. Itsaid factories, schools and transportation companies were closed inStepanakert.   The Nagorno-Karabakh Communist Party and Council of People'sDeputies said in an appeal to the population, ``In the currentsituation, various kinds of meetings, demonstrations, marches andgatherings can aggravate the situation further.''   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, speaking inCopenhagen, Denmark, said without elaborating that the Kremlin wasconsidering the use of ``some emergency action'' to deal with therising unrest.   The Stepanakert and Agdam regions of Nagorno-Karabakh wereplaced on a ``special status,'' lower than a state of emergency,and a curfew was imposed, Tass said.   Telephone calls to Stepanakert did not go through.   Popoyan said soldiers patrolled Stepanakert and receivedpermission to search houses at will.   ``People are simply sitting home and not going anywhere.Naturally, they're not going to work,'' he said.   Although Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, it ispredominantly Armenian. Residents began agitating in February forannexation to Armenia.   Popoyan said in a telephone interview earlier Wednesday thatmilitary units were in Yerevan but not visible on the streets.   Popoyan said Armenians were demanding that the annexation issuebe reconsidered because the government ``can no longer guaranteethe safety of Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh.''   The Armenian parliament made a similar appeal to the nationalgovernment in June, but Azerbaijan opposed it and the centralgovernment rejected the idea. Instead, central authoritiesdeveloped a plan of economic and social development.   About 25 Armenians at an Armenian cemetery in Moscow Wednesdayafternoon criticized the Soviet press for what they calledunbalanced reporting on disturbances in the southern republics.   Thirty-two people were killed in ethnic rioting in Sumgait, anindustrial city of Azerbaijan, at the end of February.   Some calm returned after the national Supreme Soviet on July 18rejected annexation. A handful of foreign journalists was permittedto visit Yerevan this month before the city was closed again.</TEXT></DOC>
