(the licensee), for operation of theBeaver Valley Power Station, Unit 1, located in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment would revise Table 3.5-5 of the Technical Specificationsto include the time required for suction switchover from the volume controltank to the refueling water storage tank. These changes would permit anincrease of response time for the safety injection system. In addition,there are a few editorial changes.The proposed amendment is in accordance with Duquesne Light Company's applicationdated November 12, 1987.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed changes to the Technical Specifications are needed to correctthe inadvertent omission of the switchover time in the total response time.The editorial changes are needed to clarify current requirements.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions toTechnical Specifications. The proposed revisions would only permit a slightlylonger response time for the safety injection system, and will have noother effect on plant design or operation. Therefore, the proposed changesdo not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changesare being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite,and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludesthat these proposed actions would result in no significant radiologicalenvironmental impact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changesto the Technical Specifications involve the containment system which islocated within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. They donot affect non-radiological plant effluents and have no other environmentalimpacts. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnon-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on January 7, 1988 (53 FR 459). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed actions, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would onlycontinue to require that unnecessary tests be performed.Alternative Use of ResourcesThese actions do not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement (FES) for the Beaver Valley PowerStation, Unit 1, dated July 1973.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.Finding of No Significant ImpactThe staff has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed actions will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated November 12, 1987, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,Washington, DC. and at the B.
