A federal grand jury here returned a 33-count indictmentcharging Patrick G. King, former president of Vernon Savings andLoan Association, with conspiring with other senior Vernon officersto commit fraud.   The scheme allegedly involved reimbursing Vernon officersapproximately $55,000 for political campaign contributions tocandidates for state and federal office, said FBI special agentWoody Specht.   The indictment charges that the scheme involved contributions in1986 to Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Loeffler andthe 1986 Texas Tribute, an organization that donated money toseveral politicians, including House Speaker Jim Wright of FortWorth, U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp,R-New York.   But the indictment emphasized that there were no allegationswhatsoever that any of the candidates or campaign organizationsknew that the contributions were coming from Vernon or wereotherwise illegal.   Wright, under fire for alleged ethics violations, announced hisresignation as speaker Wednesday.   Cranston was serving on the banking committee at the time of thedonations, the indictment said.   The indictment, which charges King with conspiring with othersenior officers to defraud the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and tomisapply Vernon funds and enter false statements in its books andrecords, was announced by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.   The task force is a multi-agency group which brought the chargesas part of the U.S. Justice Department's ongoing investigation ofsuspected fraud in the Texas banking and savings industry.   ``In effect, the indictment charges that officials contributedto campaigns but were then reimbursed through various methods likethrough payroll accounts, expense accounts,'' Specht said. ``Theywere getting the money back.   ``The indictment shows that bank officials made contributionsand then false entries were made, et cetera, to conceal the factthat funds were really paid for political contributions,'' he said.   Vernon, which had offices in Vernon, Texas, and Dallas, wasclosed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, onNov. 19, 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
