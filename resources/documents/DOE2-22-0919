Andean countries, especially Peru, are known to havesignificant underutilized coal reserves, which could prove socially andeconomically attractive for energy policy and planning and for long-termself-sufficiency. At present, many industrial operations and electric-generatingfacilities in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru are dependent on fuel-oil fromdiminishing domestic reserves or from imports. With current prices ofcoal generally about half those for residual petroleum fuels (based onenergy content), the potential exists for exploitation of Andean coalas an alternative to petroleum fuels. Greater use of coal resources wouldhelp meet the demand for increased energy needed to improve living standardsand for increased industrialization in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
