It has been shown that making direct use of thesun's energy through passive solar design in buildings is one of themost economically attractive ways of using renewable energy in Britain.Combined with energy efficiency measures, passive solar design can reduceenergy consumption by as much as 50 per cent in housing and lead to substantialenergy savings in commercial buildings. Examples of passive solar designinclude large south facing windows and small north facing areas, a highlyglazed unheated room on the south side of a house, trombe walls, perimeterand core daylighting systems in large commercial buildings. By contrast,the R and D programme has demonstrated that active solar technology usingheat collectors and a transfer fluid are unlikely to be cost effectivein British climatic conditions except for special applications such asswimming pools. Photovoltaic systems were abandoned early in the programmeas offering little prospect of making an economic contribution to UKenergy supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
