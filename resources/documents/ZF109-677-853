White, undersecretary of Commerce for technology, and ColinMcMillan, assistant secretary of Defense for production and logistics,announced plans to develop a &quot;standard for the exchange of product modeldata&quot; (STEP).andP;  The announcement came at the Computer-Aided Acquisition andLogistics Support conference here.andM;The ability to express digitally all useful information about a product andexchange that data is key to computer-integrated manufacturing and concurrentengineering, said Commerce spokesman John Blair.andM;STEP will be a common standard to which all design and manufacturing softwarecan adhere.andP;  It will allow users with different computers to contribute,access and share mechanical, electronic and structural information notpreviously available in a standard format, Blair said.andM;As the next generation of the Product Data Exchange Specification (PDES),STEP will go beyond PDES.andP;  PDES focuses on exchanging product models withsufficient information content so that computer-aided design, computer-aidedmanufacturing and computer-aided engineering application programs caninterpret the information.andM;As proof of DOD's commitment to the STEP program, McMillan said when STEO iscomplete, it will become a requirement in DOD contracts.andM;Commerce and DOD will establish an interagency executive group headed byWhite and McMillan to coordinate development of the standard.andM;Under the joint action plan, designed to spur product data exchange researchin the United States, DOD and Commerce will expand STEP research at theNational PDES Testbed at the National Institute of Standards and Technologyin Gaithersburg, Md.andM;Commerce's White said &quot;successful implementation of STEP by American softwaremanufacturing interests will reduce costs and provide a global competitiveadvantage for our products.&quot;andM;&quot;We can't afford to develop non-standard, proprietary, disjointed patchworksolutions when the rest of the industrial world is moving toward a singlestandard,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;U.S.andP;  industry must be a leader in this internationaleffort or risk being an outsider in a global market controlled by morefarsighted competitors.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
