Roh condemned demonstrations by radical students and saiddissident groups were trying to spoil the mood before the Sept. 17start of the Olympic Games in Seoul. He appealed to oppositionleaders to support the government in curbing unrest.   ``An eruption of demonstrations involving firebombs, stones andtear gas during the Olympics would disrupt the Olympics and ournation would become an object of worldwide scorn,'' Roh told ameeting reviewing Olympic preparations.   Later, radical students battled riot police with firebombs androcks at least three campuses in Seoul after rallies to prepare fora march Monday to the border for reunification talks with NorthKorean students.   Riot police fired tear gas to drive students back. Eyewitnessesreported some arrests and injuries, but police refused to give anyfigures.   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said today that 2,099radicals were detained the previous two days for taking part indemonstrations to support the Monday march, which the governmenthas prohibited. All but 243 students were released.   Police officials said 13 police stations were attacked bystudents nationwide this week and several dozen officers wereinjured.   Radical students have staged scattered protests in Seoul andother cities to prepare for the march and fought riot police inminor confrontations in some places. Turnouts at rallies during thepast five days have been low.   A similar march June 10 for talks with North Korean studentdelegates was blocked by riot police. Support for the latest marchappears to be low because of public opposition, a summer heat waveand college vacations.   Also today, Assembly Speaker Kim Chae-sun suggested thatdelegates from North and South Korea meet at Panmunjom next Fridayto discuss the possibility of a North-South parliamentary meeting.The North has proposed the discussion be held Wednesday.   South Korea's National Assembly made its counterproposal in aletter delivered to North Korea through the truce village ofPanmunjom inside the Demilitarized Zone.   In a letter sent to South Korea on Tuesday, North Korea said theworking meeting, if held, should discuss only logisticalarrangements for full parliamentary talks which it hopes would beheld before the end of this month.   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to tryto mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. Thestudents, a small but vocal minority on college campuses, havefailed to gain support because of their violent tactics and openadvances to the communist North.   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of WorldWar II. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start the KoreanWar.   The North is demanding that Seoul to let it be a co-host at theGames, but the International Olympic Committee has said theOlympics cannot be shared.   As a result, North Korea said it will boycott the event.   South Korea today welcomed the International Olympic Committee'slatest attempt to persuade North Korea to change its mind.   On Thursday, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch proposed thatthe North and South Korean teams could march side by side in theopening and closing ceremonies, each carrying its own flag, while asingle Olympic flag preceded the overall Korean group.   He said North Korean participation would demonstrate its``strong desire for dialogue and reconciliation.''   ``We are still very anxious to have their participation,'' saidShin Hyon-ung, director general of international press for theSeoul Olympic Organizing Committee.   ``If North Korea accepts the IOC offer, it would be a very goodidea to march in parallel with North Korea in the openingceremony,'' Shin said.</TEXT></DOC>
