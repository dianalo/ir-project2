In another event that fueled the climate of violence between Israel and Palestinian Arabs, Israel launched air attacks against Palestinian strongholds in southern Lebanon, killing at least 19 people. The Saturday night raids, apparently ordered in retaliation for a hang-glider attack in November that killed six Israeli soldiers, prompted a vow of revenge by a guerrilla group based in Syria.    The disturbances yesterday on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip shattered 10 days of fragile quiet after Israel increased its military presence in the occupied areas. The U.S. has strongly criticized Israel's use of lethal force to quell demonstrations and had asked the government to avoid deportations. But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel will continue to handle its security as it thinks best.    Early yesterday, Israel announced it was freeing 186 Arab prisoners and expelling nine others blamed for rioting last month. But the shooting of Haniya Suleiman in the Palestinian town of Ram, about five miles north of Jerusalem, sparked the day's worst confrontations.    Neighbors said the young woman was shot at close range when she tried to stop an Israeli soldier who was arresting a boy who had run into her house. &quot;She was on the porch, hanging out washing, when a soldier kicked open the door,&quot; said Nadir Dwek, who lives nearby. &quot;When she asked him to let the boy go he shot her in the chest.&quot;    She was the 23rd Palestinian killed by Israeli soldiers since unrest broke out four weeks ago. An Israeli military spokesman said the soldier and his commanding officer have been suspended pending an inquiry.    By early afternoon, Ram's streets were full of rock-hurling teen-agers. In scenes similar to riots in Gaza last month, youths set fire to tires as soldiers in riot gear bombarded them with tear gas.    But unlike overcrowded and impoverished Gaza, Ram is a prosperous neighborhood of handsome new stone houses: The kind of place the Israeli government points to when stressing the economic benefits West Bank Palestinians have enjoyed during Israel's 20-year occupation.    Many of the rioters were smartly dressed young men and women in leather jackets and well-tailored pants. From houses overlooking the street, older women threw onions to the demonstrators. The fumes are thought to help ward off the effects of tear gas. A few young girls who weren't throwing rocks gathered rubble for the rioters from nearby construction sites.    In side streets away from the demonstration, a group of young men said they weren't taking part for fear of informers. &quot;Half the people out there are working for the Israelis,&quot; one youth said. However, most said they supported the demonstrators, and they believed further violence was inevitable.    &quot;This country is like a balloon,&quot; said Amar, an 18-year-old student. &quot;You squeeze tighter and tighter and one day it will explode.&quot;    In southern Lebanon, meantime, police and hospital sources said seven infants were among the 19 Palestinians and Lebanese killed in the Israeli air attacks. Witnesses said Israeli jets and helicopter gunships bombed the Druze-controlled village of Barja and Druze-controlled coastal areas of Awali, Damour and Jiyeh, which have large Palestinian populations, as well as Palestinian guerrilla bases near Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.    Security sources said the raids were apparently in revenge for the hang-glider attack in November by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. In Damascus, Syria, the guerrilla group vowed revenge for the latest raids. &quot;We confirm that this barbaric massacre shall be confronted by us with the right retaliation,&quot; it said in a statement.    And in Cairo, Egypt, as many as 200 women burned Israeli flags and shouted slogans to protest Israel's clampdown on Palestinians in the occupied territories, witnesses said. </TEXT></DOC>
