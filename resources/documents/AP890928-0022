(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For University of Virginia seniorMike Cloud, President Bush's education summit means he must be upand out of his room by 6 a.m.   But others are getting a chance to see some of their classroomstudies acted out in real life, and they're taking the opportunityto talk with the nation's chief government executives and leadersof the media.   Kimberly Zenarolla, a freshman who hopes to get intobroadcasting, says the summit is a chance to meet people such asArkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and CNN reporter Bernard Shaw.   ``I've been totally into it,'' said Miss Zenarolla, a VirginiaBeach native whose picture with Shaw appeared Wednesday on thefront page of The Cavalier Daily, the student-run newspaper. ``Thewhole thing has been so exciting.''   After watching a television crew interview Virginia Gov. GeraldL. Baliles, host governor for the summit, Miss Zenarolla toldBaliles, ``I want to be governor of Virginia someday.''   ``I would pursue it,'' Baliles told her. ``I'd vote for you.''   But Cloud, a philosophy and history major from Wilmington, Del.,was not bubbling over about having to leave his room on theuniversity's West Lawn before dawn.   ``I suppose it's worth it for the security of the president, butI'm not sure it's worth it for all of the rhetoric,'' he said ofthe summit.   Cloud's room is near the center of the university founded byThomas Jefferson. The area has been disrupted for various periodswhen Bush was around.   Some classes were moved to make room for visitors at the two-daysummit, prompting Lisa Roberge, a junior from Richmond, to wonderwhy the event wasn't scheduled for two weeks later, during fallbreak.   Still, she said, ``most students here feel it's a prestigiousevent to have at the university.''   The student newspaper, in an editorial on the summit's openingday, took note of the prevailing mixture of ``confusion andhassles'' with ``unprecedented excitement.''   ``The university's investment in this publicity plum shouldprovide abundant returns and an enhanced reputation for many yearsto come,'' the editorial said.   Many students are taking a keen interest in the discussionsPresident Bush is having with the nation's governors about a topicthey are expert on _ education.   ``Certainly, not all problems will be solved here,'' said BrettMarston, a senior from Appomattox, Va. ``But at least it'll bringeducation into the national spotlight.''   Marston, a government major, said the federal government shouldtake a more active role in education, not so much for funding, butto improve the efficiency of public school systems.   Kimberly Harrison, a junior majoring in economics, said the ideaof developing national standards to measure educational performanceis a good one.   But Miss Harrison, from near Petersburg, Va., said the moneyquestion is more crucial to schools.   ``I don't want to pay for it. You don't want to pay for it,''she said. ``But I think that increasing taxes is the only way wecan pay for it all.''</TEXT></DOC>
