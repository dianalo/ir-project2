The options exchange fined Joseph J. Bianco, a former CBOE member, $2,500 and suspended him from associating with exchange members for three weeks for allegedly making a trade that wasn't exposed to other traders in the open market. The CBOE said Mr. Bianco allegedly made the trade to eliminate a personal debt with another member.    The CBOE alleged that exchange member Joseph J. Gregory entered into this illicit trade with Mr. Bianco. Mr. Gregory was fined $5,000 and suspended from associating with an exchange member for one week.    The two traders, neither of whom could be reached for comment, agreed to the sanctions without admitting or denying that they had violated CBOE rules. </TEXT></DOC>
