The bill, including controversial provisions giving the militarynew authority to enter the fight against illegal drugs, passed theSenate on Friday, ending a parliamentary dispute that had delayedfinal action for two weeks.   The approval sends the measure to a House-Senate conferencecommittee, which will begin meeting next month to try to work outdifferences between the House and Senate versions of thelegislation.   The Senate's anti-drug provision includes arrest powers forNaval officers whose warships stop drug boats in internationalwaters. The House bill, which passed overwhelmingly, is morefar-reaching. It orders President Reagan to have the militaryessentially seal the U.S. borders against drug smugglers.   The Senate approved the bill on a voice vote in an almost-emptychamber late in the afternoon, shortly before adjourning for aMemorial Day recess. That procedure was unusual. There is usually aroll call vote on the budget for the federal government's largestsingle agency.   Approval came after Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., withdrew anamendment which would have permitted the death penalty to be metedout to drug pushers who are convicted of killing persons.   D'Amato's proposal will be considered as a separate piece oflegislation when the Senate returns next month.   Originally, he had attached his plan as an amendment to thePentagon bill because Senate opponents had threatened to filibustera free-standing bill. His proposal is popular in the Senate, butits filibuster rules are designed to protect the right of theminority.   The Senate was close to passing the Pentagon bill two weeks ago,but D'Amato refused to drop his amendment. He finally gave wayFriday after Democratic leaders renewed their argument that lack ofa defense budget bill would harm U.S. national security.   Both House and Senate bills authorize $299.5 billion in Pentagonspending. The current defense budget is $291 billion. The $299.5billion figure was approved by Reagan last December as part of theagreement between the White House and Congress to reduce federalbudget deficits.   The bills contain money for a vast array of weapons. Among thosein the Senate measure are another Trident missile-firing submarine,two more 688-class attack subs, the first of the new``Seawolf''-class of attack subs, three destroyers, 72 F-18fighters, 36 F-15s, 180 F-16s and 72 Apache attack helicopters.   Besides the anti-drug provisions, other differences between thetwo bills include:</TEXT><TEXT>   STAR WARS _ The Senate measure proposed $4.6 billion forReagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, while the House voted $3.5billion. Reagan had wanted $4.8 billion. The most likely compromisewould be about $4.1 billion, which would be an increase over thecurrent SDI budget of $3.9 billion.   ARMS CONTROL _ Both bills ban any SDI tests that would violatethe existing, ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile treaty. But the House measure contains two otherrestrictions, including a ban on spending for any weapons thatviolate numerical restrictions on various categories of weapons inthe unratified 1979 SALT II treaty, and a ban on all but thesmallest tests of U.S. nuclear weapons.   PAY RAISE _ The Senate approved Reagan's request for a 4.3percent average pay raise for the nation's 2.1 million uniformedmilitary personnel, while the House voted for a 4 percent increase.   BASE CLOSINGS _ The Senate bill creates a 15-member Pentagoncommission to study the nation's 3,600 military installations andrecommend by Dec. 31 which ones can be closed. No such provision ispart of the House bill, although that chamber is considering thebase-closing commission as part of a separate bill.   CENTRAL AMERICA _ The House bill includes a prohibition againstsending any U.S. combat troops to leftist-ruled Nicaragua, a banthe Senate refused to add. Reagan has repeatedly said the UnitedStates has no intention of sending combat troops to the CentralAmerican nation.   LAND-BASED NUCLEAR MISSILES _ Reagan sought $793 million for arailroad-based version of the MX nuclear missile and $200 millionfor research into the Midgetman missile. The House approved $100million for the MX and $600 million for Midgetman, while the Senatevoted $700 million for MX and only $50 million for Midgetman.</TEXT></DOC>
