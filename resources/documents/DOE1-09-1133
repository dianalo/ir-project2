Gamma-ray dataestablish a 4.7(3)% Gamow-Teller {beta}decay branch proceeding to high-spinstates above 2 MeV excitation in /sup 151/Ho. A weak {beta}decay branchof 0.7(3)% was also observed for the 0.5s 27/2/sup -/ isomer in the /sup149/Dy isotone, and it was established that a similar 27/2/sup -/ E3-isomerdoes not occur in /sup 153/Yb. First results on the /sup 151/Tm and /sup151/Er ground state {beta}decays are briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
