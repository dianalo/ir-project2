A pair of pivotally mounted arms are each provided with      hooks or loops of a pad member which cooperate with hooks or loops      fastened to the engagement surface of the light source for engaging the      light modifier thereto. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a light diffuser or modifier for use with      light sources in photography. Diffused or indirect lighting is used in      both still and motion picture type photography. To achieve an indirect,      soft type lighting effect it is desirable to first either directly or      indirectly pass the light through a semi-transparent material to break up      and diffuse the light rays. Such lighting is generally produced by light      sources which are remote from the camera. </PAR><PAR>  Each particular area to be lighted will dictate the type and intensity of      light that will be needed. In some situations direct light from the light      source without any alteration may be required. In other situations direct      light may be too strong or cast overly distinct shadows in which case a      more diffuse light will be more desirable. In still other cases an even      more indirect diffuse light may be needed to create the proper lighting      effect. It is also important to have a great deal of uniformity in the      lighting to assist the photographer in properly lighting the subject. One      type of light diffuser is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,425 (copy      enclosed) which is incorporated herein by reference. </PAR><PAR>  The light diffuser should also be capable of being used with almost any      type of light source and preferably may be readily and easily attached to      and detached from the light source. It is also desirable to have a light      diffuser that is a compact, self-contained unit that is easy to position      and use. </PAR><PAR>  It is an object of the present invention to provide a photographic light      diffuser or modifier that will yield such lighting through a device that      is lightweight, compact, easily transported and readily and easily      attached to and detached from the light source. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the present invention to provide a photographic      light modifier that is useable with a wide variety of light sources. </PAR><PAR>  Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more      apparent from a further review of the following specification, drawings      and claims. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a photographic light diffuser or modifier      which may be readily and easily attached to and detached from a light      source to provide diffused light for photographic purposes. The modifier      has a cover positioned over a frame structure which is moveable from a      substantially planar position for storage to an open position for      attachment to a light source to act as a light diffuser for photographic      purposes. The frame structure has a substantially rectangular support      member with a pair of arms each of which is pivotally mounted on one of      the ends of the rectangular support member for movement from a collapsed      position in which the arms are substantially planar to the rectangular      support member to an open position for engagement with a light source.      According to the present invention, the each of the arms is provided with      a pad having releasable engagement means such as loops or hooks which      cooperate with opposing loops or hooks mounted on each side of the light      source, each of which is formed of synthetic material which adheres when      pressed together and is sold under the trademark &quot;VELCRO&quot;. The pads are      pivotally engaged to the end of each of the arms. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view showing the photographic light modifier of the      present invention secured to a light source. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a view similar to FIG. 1 but showing only the frame without the      cover attached thereto and with the frame secured to a light source. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken through line 3--3 of FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a plan view showing the light modifier of the present invention      in the collapsed position. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG. 1 showing a modified embodiment. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in FIG. 1 a photographic      light modifier 10 of the present invention secured to a light source L. As      can be seen more clearly in FIG. 2 the modifier photographic light 10      includes a frame assembly generally designated by the numeral 11 over      which is positioned a cover 12. </PAR><PAR>  The light source L may be of any desired shape or configuration but will      generally include a glass panel 14 through which the light is emitted and      a housing 16 supporting the glass panel 14 and the light source. As shown,      the housing 16 includes an upper panel 17, a lower panel 18 and a pair of      flat side panels 19 and 20 which cooperate to support the glass panel 14. </PAR><PAR>  The cover 12 of the photographic light modifier 10 includes a translucent      panel 22 which, when the modifier photographic light 10 is fastened to the      light source 12, is spaced from and generally parallel to the glass panel      14. The cover also includes a reflective member 24 extending from the      translucent panel 22 to a free end 25 pulled together by an elastic member      (not shown) which defines an opening which is expansible for receiving the      end of the housing 16 supporting the glass panel 14. Thus, as can be seen      in FIG. 1, the elastic causes the free end 25 of the cover 12 to snugly      engage the top upper panel 17, bottom lower panel 18 and flat side panels      19 and 20 of the housing 16 so that light being emitted through the glass      panel 14 will be captured within the cover and be emitted in a diffused      manner through the translucent panel 22. </PAR><PAR>  As can be seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the translucent panel 22 has a generally      rectangular shape; however, other configurations may be used. The      reflective member 24, when the modifier photographic light 10 is engaged      to the light source L, defines a series of wall sections each having a      generally trapezoidal shape with a long base at the edge toward the      translucent panel 22 and a shorter top at the edge adjacent the free end      25. As can be seen in FIG. 4, when the light modifier 10 is removed from      the light source L to a collapsed position, the reflective member 24      simply becomes bunched. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2, the frame 11 includes a rectangular support member      28 having an upper leg 28a, a lower leg 28b and side legs 28c and 28d. The      support member 28, although shown as rectangular in shape, may have any      desired shape including, but not limited to, circular, oval, hexogonal,      trapezoidal or the like. Preferably, its shape will be similar to the      shape of the translucent panel 22. The rectangular support member 28 may      be formed of a semi-rigid wire of a size to provide sufficient rigidity to      support the cover and yet light enough in weight to be readily handled. </PAR><PAR>  Pivotally secured to each of the end members 28c and 28d of the rectangular      support member 28 is an arm 30. The arms 30 each include an upper segment      30a, a lower segment 30b which taper toward one another and are joined      together by a central segment 30c which preferably has a length      substantially shorter than the height of the flat side panels 19 and 20 of      the light source L. Each of the upper and lower segments 30a and 30b have      their ends looped around the respective side legs 28c and 28d of the      rectangular support member 28. Thus, looking at FIG. 2, the arm 30 on the      right side of the rectangular support member 28 has the free end of upper      segment 30a looped around and pivotally secured to the upper end of the      side leg 28d at its juncture with the upper leg 28a and the free end of      lower segment 30b looped around and pivotally secured to the lower end of      the side leg 28d adjacent the lower leg 28b. </PAR><PAR>  Rotatably engaged to each of the central segments 30c is a pad member 32      comprising an inner flat member 33 and an outer member 34 fastened thereto      which has been shaped to form a protrusion 35 defining a passageway      between the inner flat member 33 and outer member 34 for receiving the      central segment 30c of the arm 30. (See FIG. 3). </PAR><PAR>  Secured to the surface of the inner flat member 33 opposite the outer      member 34 are loops 36 of a synthetic material which adheres to hooks 37      of synthetic material which adheres when pressed together and is sold      under the trademark &quot;VELCRO&quot;. However, other types of fasteners which      stick together may be used such as those marketed by the industrial      specialties division of 3M Corporation, St. Paul, Minn. sold under its      registered trademarks &quot;SCOTCHMATE&quot; and &quot;DUAL LOC&quot;. As can be seen in FIG.      3, the hooks 37 are permanently adhered to the housing 16 of the light      source L, with one of the hooks 37 being fastened to the flat side panel      19 and another of the hooks (not shown) adhered to the opposite flat side      panel 20. </PAR><PAR>  Each of the arms 30 has fastened thereto a spring 40. Each of the springs      40 has its opposite end fastened to the upper section 28a of the      rectangular support member 28 and functions to urge the arm 30 to which it      is attached toward a collapsed position. Thus, as may be seen in FIG. 2,      the springs 40 are pulling the arms toward one another and firmly into      engagement with the housing 16 of the light source L. </PAR><PAR>  As may be seen in FIG. 4, after removal of the photographic light modifier      10 from the light source L, the arms 30 will be pulled by the springs 40      to a position substantially parallel to the rectangular support with the      cover 12 collapsed therearound. For purposes of clarity, the arms 30 in      FIG. 4 are shown positioned at a slight angle to the plane of the      rectangular support member 28. </PAR><PAR>  As will be appreciated, the fastening means provided by the pads 32 and      their loops 36 cooperating with the hooks 37 on the housing 16 permit the      photographic light modifier 10 to be easily affixed to and disassembled      from a light source L and, upon such removal, to be easily collapsed for      storage and transport to another location. Since the pads 32 may be      rotated about the center section 30c of the arms 30, they to may be folded      to a position substantially parallel with the rectangular support member      28 when in the collapsed position. Additionally, they may be readily and      securely fastened to the housing 16 irrespective of whether the flat side      panels 19 and 20 of the housing 16 are parallel to one another or taper      toward or away from one another. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown a modified embodiment particularly      well adapted to fastening over a light source L having a relatively large      housing. Under this embodiment there is provided a cover 42 having a      translucent panel 44 and a reflective member 46. Under this embodiment the      reflective member 46 has a zipper 48 on one side permitting access to the      interior of the cover and also permitting the pads of the frame to be      engaged to the Velcro hooks on the sides of the light source housing prior      to engagement of the cover 42 to the light source. </PAR><PAR>  Other modifications will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.      For, example, the modifier could be used with a light source having a      domed cover (glass or plastic) or simply a bulb with no plate or cover so      long as there is a frame, housing or other support structure to which the      pad members may be engaged. Additionally, if the springs are strong enough      to firmly engage pads on arms to pads on the support structure, hook and      loop type fasteners would not be required and the pads could simply be      provided with rubber or pliable faces, each having a surface which will      hold the modifier in place without slipping. Additionally, the frame is      not necessarily planar but could follow a curved path. Accordingly, the      scope of the present invention should be limited only to the scope of the      appended claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
