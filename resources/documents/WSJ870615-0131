The failed banks are Whittier Thrift andamp; Loan, Whittier, Calif., which had assets of $15.5 million, and Hamilton County State Bank, Lockland, Ohio, which had assets of $8.7 million. Both were closed Friday.    Whittier Thrift andamp; Loan's three offices are to reopen as Liberty Thrift andamp; Loan, a newly chartered subsidiary of Investors Bancor, Orange, Calif., a holding company. Whittier Thrift andamp; Loan, which held $14.8 million in 2,100 deposit accounts, was the third California bank to fail this year.    Hamilton County State is to reopen as a branch of Provident Bank, Cincinnati. On June 4, the directors of Hamilton County State voluntarily surrendered the bank's charter to state banking regulators because of operating and earnings difficulties. The regulators operated the institution as conservators until they closed it.    Hamilton County State, which held deposits of $7.3 million in 2,600 accounts, was the first bank to fail in Ohio this year. Nationwide, 90 banks have failed this year. </TEXT></DOC>
