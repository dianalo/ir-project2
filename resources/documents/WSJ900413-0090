Arch A. Moore Jr. agreed toplead guilty to charges of extortion, obstruction of justice,and tax and mail fraud in a scheme to extort money from acoal operator and buy votes.   Mr. Moore, 66 years old, faces up to 36 years in prisonand fines of as much as $1.2 million, said Larry Ellis, anassistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of WestVirginia. A sentencing date hasn't been set.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday's five-count indictment by a Charleston grandjury accused Mr. Moore, a three-time Republican governor ofthe predominantly Democratic state, of illegal activitieswhile campaigning and serving as governor.   John Campbell, an investigator with the JusticeDepartment, called the case unprecedented. &quot;We know of noother case of similar significance in election-relatedcrimes,&quot; he said.   In a prepared statement, Mr. Moore said: &quot;This news willbe greeted with a great joy by some in the state of WestVirginia. There will be others who will be sincerely grievedby reason of their devotion to me and my family. I know Ihave their understanding and love. For that, I shall beforever grateful.&quot;   This is the second time Mr. Moore was indicted forcampaign-related wrongdoings. He was charged and thenacquitted in an alleged 1972 scheme to extort money from aCharleston savings and loan institution.   The latest indictments accuse Mr. Moore of illegallydiverting $100,000 in state funds to his 1984 electioncampaign, which his supporters paid to voters in southernWest Virginia counties.   The extortion charge relates to a scheme in which heagreed to use his influence as governor to refund $2.3million from the state's black-lung fund to H. Paul Kizer,owner of Maben Energy Corp. of Beckley, W.Va. Mr. Kizer,whose concern is one of the state's top coal producers,agreed to offer Mr. Moore 25% of the refund as kickbacks, theindictment says. The black-lung fund is a coalindustry-funded pool of money that provides payments todisabled miners who suffer from the disease.   Charleston attorney James Lees, who represents Mr. Kizer,said his client was &quot;a victim of extortion.&quot; Mr. Kizer hasn'tbeen charged, Mr. Ellis said.   The former governor is also charged with filing falsecampaign finance statements and tax returns in 1984 and 1985.In 1984, he allegedly failed to report contributions by alobbyist, Samuel D'Annunzio, and an unidentified agentrepresenting Island Creek Coal, a unit of OccidentalPetroleum Corp. In Lexington, Ky., a spokeswoman for IslandCreek said the company isn't aware of any payment that wasmade on its behalf to Mr. Moore.   Mr. D'Annunzio, a former president of the West VirginiaBeer Wholesalers Association, committed suicide in 1988.   In the 1985 tax return, Mr. Moore allegedly failed toreport contributions from Marrowbone Development Co., a WestVirginia coal company. Several Marrowbone officials havepreviously been convicted of tax and fraud felonies in aninvestigation of Mingo County corruption. That investigationled officials from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S.attorney's office to Gov. Moore, Mr. Ellis said.   The obstruction-of-justice charge relates to Mr. Moore'salleged attempts to influence the testimony of two witnesses,Mr. Kizer and John F. Leaberry, Mr. Moore's 1988 campaignmanager, during the investigation.   Mr. Moore served three, four-year terms before he wasdefeated in 1988 by a wide margin by current Democratic Gov.Gaston Caperton.</TEXT></DOC>
