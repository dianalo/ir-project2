MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ronald Reagan's imprint on the judiciary is farbroader and deeper than his three Supreme Court appointments _ ineight years he named nearly half the judges now on the federal bench.   His conservative legacy will extend well into the next century,ever more significant as the Supreme Court loosens the reins itsdecisions have imposed on lower courts. That's been the trend insuch recent rulings as those weighing against abortion, curtailingaffirmative action programs and permitting capital punishment ofyouthful and retarded murderers.   In a study of Reagan's judicial appointments, Sheldon Goldman, apolitical scientist at the University of Massachusetts, says theyrepresent ``a major and what is likely to be an enduring legacy.''   Reagan named 346, or 47 percent, of the nation's active federaljudges.   Goldman, writing in the journal of the American JudicatureSociety, says the Reagan administration set up the most systematicphilosophical screening process in U.S. history to check outcandidates for judicial appointments.   ``It demonstrated the importance given judicial selection by theReagan administration, and the recognition that the appointmentprocess, by placing on the bench those opposed to the creation ofnew rights by liberal activist courts, could be used to achieve theadministration's social agenda,'' Goldman says.   That process was slow, gradually gaining headway during thelatter years of Reagan's presidency, and accelerating this year,after President Bush had succeeded him.   Goldman notes that because the lower courts must follow SupremeCourt precedent in their decisions, Reagan appointees could notchange course on issues such as abortion and affirmative actionuntil the high court modified its stand on them. Now that ishappening.   Reagan named three new justices, Sandra Day O'Connor, AntoninScalia and Anthony Kennedy, and promoted William H. Rehnquist fromassociate to chief justice.   While that consolidated a conservative majority, the Reaganappointees succeeded justices who were themselves centrist orrelatively conservative. It may fall to Bush to appoint successorsto the three oldest and most liberal justices, all of them over 80.   ``I want people who will interpret the Constitution and notlegislate from the bench,'' Bush said as a candidate. That wasvintage Reagan, as was his warning against liberal activists on thebench.   But as Goldman observed, the high court ``has exercised its ownbrand of judicial activism'' in rulings to undo earlier decisions oncivil rights and other issues.   Goldman says the real impact of Reagan's appointments on districtand appeals court decisions will be gradual, reaching into the 21stcentury, and likely to be reinforced by the judges Bush chooses.   Whether that's good or bad depends on the viewpoint of the personwho is judging the trend.   ``For civil libertarians this means that when the countrycelebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the Bill ofRights in 1991, the courts will be dominated by those hostile to aliberal reading of those rights,'' Goldman says. ``For judicialconservatives, this means a healthy return to government by theelected representatives of the people.''   In the conservative view, such contentious issues as abortion,civil rights and capital punishment belong in the hands ofpoliticians, voters and legislators, rather than in the hands ofjudges with lifetime tenure.   That's the line Justice Scalia followed in his separate opinionon the abortion decision. He said the court should have overturnedits original abortion rights decision and thus yielded its control``of what I believe to be, and many of our citizens recognize to be,a political issue.''   Scalia is unwavering in that view. A decade ago, as a Universityof Chicago law professor, he advanced the same argument on federalrule-making.   ``The main problem is that the agencies have been assigned toomany tasks requiring judgments that are of an essentially politicalnature and that ought to be made by our elected representatives,''he said then.   Not that elected representatives necessarily want to handlecontentious, closely divided issues on which a vote gained may wellmean a vote lost, too. By conservative reasoning, that's theirproblem.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Wlter R.
