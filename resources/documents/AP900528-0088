(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A brilliant, stylized production ofOscar Wilde's play ``Salome'' is being presented at the SpoletoFestival U.S.A. by the Gate Theater of Dublin.   Everybody except John the Baptist is in white face. Everybodywalks in slow motion. The costumes are black for Herodias, whitefor Salome, black and white gowns for Herod's female dinner guestsand tuxedos for men.   In the fourth of 17 performance Monday at the Dock StreetTheater, John the Baptist sat, wearing torn pants, on a square atstage center, presumably at the bottom of a cistern. The lightingwas unusual and imaginative. It all worked.   Alan Stanford entered as Herod and in a few sentencesestablished his character as a complete hedonist. He was large,soft looking, effete, and looked like one imagines Wilde to havelooked. His voice was plummy, sounding rich and dissatisfied. Fromthis beginning, Stanford added to his character as the playprogresses. It was an amazing feat of acting.   Whether or not Wilde intended to make Herod the central figurein his story of obsession, Stanford has seen to it that he is.   Olwen Fouere played Salome, a spoiled teen-ager who spits backwith spite when John the Baptist rejects her advances. Her voicewas young. She's a nymphette, for the first time attracted sexuallyto a man who's handsome, strong, authoritative and probablydangerous. Fouere left it ambiguous as to whether Salome knows whatshe's doing.   It's her obsession to kiss John the Baptist that leads Salome todance for Herod and then demand John the Baptist's head. Her danceis little more than turning slowly in a circle and miming astriptease.   Stanford's Herod was superstitious, fearing that if he has Johnthe Baptist beheaded something bad will happen to him. Hisdescription of the jewels he would give Salome instead of the headis the most sensuous passage in this production.   Barbara Brennan played a brittle, husband-nagging Herodias.Wilde has given her most of his few cynical, clever lines insertedfor dramatic relief. To frequent comments on the meaning of themoon's aspect, Herodias says dryly, ``The moon is like the moon.''   Steven Berkoff directed this ``Salome'' for the Gate Theater in1988. He later directed the play in London, and played Herod.   Roger Doyle played piano on stage almost continually, sometimesquite loud when John the Baptist was shouting from his cistern,sometimes new age music behind speeches, sometimes jazz for dinnerguests to dance to. At one point, the Gate Theater was dancing analmost-Charleston in Charleston.   It's interesting, that while the Spoleto Festival worrieswhether the avant-garde musical performance art piece ``Pioneer''may be found objectionable, in 1891 ``Salome'' encountered aBritish law prohibiting showing biblical characters on stage. AndMartha Graham's modern dances based on Greek legends were onceconsidered by some too sensual to be seen.   Two of those were on Sunday night's Martha Graham Dance Companyprogram at the Gaillard Auditorium. Now they're clearly seen asmasterpieces. ``Errand into the Maze'' had Christine Dakin battlingMario Camacho as the Creature of Fear, her fear of her own sexualnature. Terese Capucilli danced Jocasta and Kenneth Topping asOedipus, in ``Night Journey,'' in which Jocasta has flashbacks oflife with a husband who was also her son. All four dancedbrilliantly.   The company also danced the Martha Graham work that is afavorite with many, ``Appalachian Spring,'' to Aaron Copland music,plus ``Diversion of Angels,'' to music by Norman Dello Joio.   Audience members reacted as though they had seen a revelation.Miss Graham, who turned 96 this month, smiled broadly while takinga curtain call and attended a party afterwards.   Spoleto Festival U.S.A. runs through June 10 and features 110performances ranging from high opera to jazz, ballet and concerts.Pulitzer prize-winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti founded thefestival in 1977 and modeled it after his Festival of Two Worlds inSpoleto, Italy.</TEXT></DOC>
