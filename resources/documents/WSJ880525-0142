Because of advances in biotechnology, consumers would routinely test themselves at home for many serious illnesses, from herpes to cancer, using kits purchased in drugstores.    It hasn't worked out that way.    Tests to screen for colon cancer haven't sold well in the five years they have been on the market. The maker of a mail-in test for gonorrhea locked horns with regulators over reporting requirements and ended up taking the product off the market. And last March, the Food and Drug Administration effectively banned over-the-counter sale of AIDS test kits.    The hurdle isn't technology. Instead, regulators, physicians and many consumers are turned off by the complexity of some of the tests, and worry about the implications of positive results.    For one thing, doctors and regulators fear consumers who test themselves might also try to treat themselves without seeking medical help.    &quot;I can just see people getting the test results at home and saying, 'Aha, that's what I've got,' and then going to the pharmacist to find some over-the-counter preparation. That's not the way to do it,&quot; says Dr. Daniel R. Mishell, chairman of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at the University of Southern California.    Moreover, in the case of AIDS and other terminal diseases, regulators are leery of consumers learning of a positive result without getting medical counseling.    For this reason, Jack Salzman, a drug industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., says: &quot;As you see more diagnostic tests dealing with more life-and-death issues, you will see a go-slow attitude on the part of regulators and manufacturers.&quot;    Such pharmaceutical giants as Abbott Laboratories, Johnson andamp; Johnson and Eli Lilly andamp; Co. are targeting their diagnostic tests to health professionals, as they have in the past, rather than the home market. This strategy lets them take advantage of established distribution networks and saves them from alienating physicians by taking business away from them; it also eases concerns about potential liability for false negative or false positive results from home tests.    Companies interested in the home market -- generally smaller firms -- admit it will be slow going. Tambrands Inc., for example, is developing about a dozen tests but doesn't expect them to hit the market soon. Edwin H. Shutt Jr., chairman, recently told shareholders Tambrands is &quot;running into reluctance&quot; on the part of regulators over issues including the prospect of self-treatment and false results from consumer error. The Lake Success, N.Y., company is awaiting FDA clearance for a home-strep-throat test it now sells in Canada.    Test kits using chemical processes have been around since 1976, when Warner-Lambert Co. introduced the first home pregnancy test. Most of the 100 or so kits approved by the FDA since then have been to test for pregnancy or to monitor blood sugar or ovulation, although biotechnology already makes feasible home tests for a wide range of serious diseases.    Sales of chemical tests totaled $199 million in 1986 and will grow to $488 million in 1991, says Frost andamp; Sullivan, a market research firm. Robert Hannon, a medical technology consultant with Genesis Group Co., believes most growth will be in tests to monitor illnesses already diagnosed, like blood-sugar tests for diabetics.    Many consumers clearly aren't ready for diagnostic testing. Cindy Parker, a Queens, N.Y., computer programmer who recently bought a pregnancy-test kit, says: &quot;Testing for pregnancy is one thing, but if I felt my kids had measles or strep throat, I wouldn't trust any drugstore test.&quot;    Such consumer reluctance helped to dash sales of the blood-in-the-stool tests that signal cancer, hemorrhoids and ulcers. Last year, Warner-Lambert stopped advertising its First Detector colo-rectal tests because of soft sales. (The tests are still sold for about $8.)    Regulatory problems were behind the failure of a test for venereal disease made by MF Industries Inc. In 1985, the company took its VD Alert mail-in test for gonorrhea off the market after regulators in several states wanted the company to comply with state law and report all positive test results to health authorities.    Similarly, the FDA ended several companies' plans to market home AIDS tests when the agency said it wouldn't consider applications for such products. The FDA questioned the accuracy of the tests and cited worries about the psychological impact of home testing: It said AIDS tests should be restricted to a &quot;comprehensive health care environment&quot; where counseling and treatment are available. </TEXT></DOC>
