The effect of vibrationis to decrease or to eliminate gel strength of the cement slurry as itis curing. The slurry then flows downward to compensate for shrinkageand re-establishes the hydrostatic head of the cement. This method canprevent pore-fluid entry into the annulus before the cement cures andcan increase the radial stress at the interface between the formationand the cured cement.</TEXT></DOC>
