Six experiments were conducted at 110{degree}Cand 300 bar pressure using a 0.5 ml fluid flow rate. Experimental variableswere: (1) solution composition (distilled, deionized water; Citronelleinjection water without chemical additives; Citronelle injection waterwith surfactant and oxygen scavenger chemical additives; 4% KCl solutionwith surfactant chemical additive) and (2) solid sample composition.Dissolution of sandstone framework and authigenic mineral constituentsresult in increased sample permeability. Improvement in reservoir permeabilityshould be greatest near injection wells, where mineral dissolution ratesare highest. Well treatments using potassium chloride solutions promotethe rapid growth of authigenic illite in Sand No. 36, probably throughthe interaction of K{sup +} with feldspars and/or kaolinite. Well borearea damage can be expected to result from this treatment procedure.Substantial kaolinite migration was found to occur and is postulatedto be a potential source of reservoir damage, particularly around injectionwells. Both silica and calcium carbonate precipitation were documentedto occur in most of the experiments. Differences in the mobilities ofthese substances in the pH range 3.6-6.5 lead to the interpretation thatsilica fouling damage should primarily affect injection wells, and calcitecement damage should be primarily concentrated around production wells.Further study is required to characterize the migration paths of theseprecipitates in the sand unit. 11 refs., 15 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
