But the storms left at least 12 people dead in Georgia, SouthCarolina and North Carolina. And although the heavy rains wereforecast to end, residents of low-lying areas were not out ofdanger.   ``Even if it stops raining, the dams could develop problems twoor three days from now,'' said George Ballenger, chief of dams andreservoir safety in Columbia, S.C.   ``There's a lag time between the time the water falls and worksits way down to the dam,'' Ballenger said.   Still, the clear skies offered a welcome respite.   ``The sun's shining brightly,'' said Gwen White, a spokeswomanfor the Dare County emergency operations in North Carolina, onSaturday. ``I don't even know if we're going to get any rain out ofit.''   Lili was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm shortlybefore 6 a.m. Saturday, and all tropical storm watches and warningswere canceled along the mid-Atlantic coast. At 10:30 p.m. EDTSaturday, Lili's center was located near latitude 37.1 north,longitude 70.9 west, or about 280 miles south of Nantucket Island,Mass.   Lili was expected to increase in forward speed and turn towardthe northeast. Its maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph, downfrom 60 mph at 6 p.m. EDT, and some decrease in strength wasforecast.   Head-high waves Friday afternoon claimed a 10-foot section ofdune fence near the base of the Cape Hatteras lighthouse. Thecentury-old safety beacon, the oldest on the East Coast, was in noimminent danger, authorities said.   ``The rains have stopped in the western part of the state and,of course, in the eastern part of the state, Hurricane Lili hasgone way offshore,'' said Graham Wilson, spokesman for the StateEmergency Response Team in North Carolina. ``The problem in thewestern part of the state is still some water on the roads.''   More than 2,000 South Carolinians were told Friday night toevacuate their homes as rivers and creeks swelled around the stateand threatened to flood more low-lying areas.   Earlier, residents boarded up their windows along NorthCarolina's Outer Banks, shelters were readied and some touristsfled, but the state was spared Lili's full brunt, forecasters said.   At least 12 people died in the onslaught of tropical stormsMarco and Klaus.   A 2-year-old boy died Friday in South Carolina after he wanderedaway from home. Four others drowned Wednesday when a dam broke,including a 10-year-old boy whose body was not found untilSaturday.   Rising waters in Georgia killed four people, including an80-year-old man as he and his wife struggled to leave a floodedrailroad track.   One person drowned and two died in storm-related trafficaccidents in North Carolina.   In Florida, cleanup was under way along the central Gulf Coast,where Marco caused $1.5 million in damage.   ``When it hit here, it slammed us,'' said Joe Miller, ManateeCounty parks director. ``I'm still amazed. I'd hate to see ahurricane.''</TEXT></DOC>
