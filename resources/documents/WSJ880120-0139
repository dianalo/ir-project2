The reduction, which had been anticipated, isn't expected to have any significant effect on MCI's earnings, because it passes on savings from a recent decline in connection charges to long-distance companies. Still, MCI's first-quarter results could benefit somewhat because access charges for all companies declined Jan. 1, two months before the MCI cut takes effect, analysts noted.    Residential customers will receive a 2.9% reduction in MCI charges as a result of the cuts. Business customers using the MCI 800 service will see a 3.5% reduction, while MCI's nearly private network for intercompany calling will see an average 7% reduction.    MCI didn't say how much the planned cuts would reduce its revenue, which in 1986 totaled $3.59 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
