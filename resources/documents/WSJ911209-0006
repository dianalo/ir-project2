Analysts have predicted for some time that Soviet saleswould abate, yet metal has poured into the world markets fromthe Soviet Union this year, causing prices to sink to levelsnot seen in years.</LP><TEXT>   But with the dissolution of the Soviet central governmentand the breakdown of the economy in recent months, argumentsthat the end of heavy Soviet metal sales is in sight aregaining credibility. In 1992, analysts say exports of gold,platinum, copper, aluminium and nickel will slide, partlybecause economic chaos in the Soviet Union has disruptedproduction and transportation of the metals, and the countryappears to have already drawn down its stockpiles.   &quot;There is a good chance that Soviet metals exports willpeak this year,&quot; says Thomas Baack, chief economist ofMetallgesellschaft AG in Frankfurt.   Acute energy shortages and problems such as pollution willcrimp metal production, he says. Moreover, Soviet republicswill be wary of exporting surplus stocks of raw materialsneeded for domestic industry, he says.   In some cases, the low prices themselves could discourageSoviet sales. Norilskiy Metals, the leading Russian nickelproducer, said it was considering temporarily halting saleson the foreign market because of low international prices.   Some of the pressure to sell metal to raise foreigncurrency needed to pay debt was relieved recently when theGroup of Seven leading industrial nations agreed to deferbillions in Soviet debt payments.   Commodity dealers and analysts also point to signs thatthe Russian Republic intends to centralize the sale of itscommodities to obtain better prices.   In the past two years, international merchants wereswamped by competing Soviet organizations and businessmenoffering commodities at discounts, says Edwin Arnold,London-based metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, Pierce,Fenner andamp; Smith. Some Soviet commodity export and barterbusinesses were rife with corruption, he says.   But the Russian Republic's move last month to suspendlicenses on oil exports and take control of gold, diamond andcoal dealings was an indication that natural resource saleswill be more controlled in the future, analysts and dealerssay.   &quot;It is vitally necessary for the Russian government tosimplify trade connections with the West,&quot; says IgorGeraschenko, director of East West Import Export Co., aLondon organization that trades with the Soviet Union.   While the government sorts out how to sell metal to theWest, analysts say there will be less in the coming months tosell because of declining production caused by the severeSoviet winter and transportation problems.   Mr. Arnold estimates that eastern Europe, but mainlySoviet, gold exports will fall to 260 metric tons next yearfrom 350 tons in 1991. Aluminum from mines will slump to600,000 metric tons from 700,000 tons, he says, whilealuminum scrap exports estimated at 300,000 metric tons thisyear are likely to be &quot;sharply lower&quot; in 1992.   Copper exports in 1992 will decline to 210,000 tons froman estimated 250,000 metric tons this year and 405,000 tonsin 1990, he says. Meanwhile, nickel exports are expected toslide to about 93,000 tons from about 110,000 tons this year.   Some analysts, such as Robin Bhar of London brokers CarrKitcat andamp; Aitken, however, believe that the foreign exchangecrisis will force Soviet republics to continue selling largequantities of minerals.   Through it all, the one commodity that has been relativelystable is diamonds.   De Beers Centenary AG, for example, continues to receiveits monthly allocation of diamonds from Russia, says GaryRalfe, a director of the Swiss-based, but South African-ownedcompany that controls 80% of the world rough diamond market.   The Soviet Union's diamond industry organizations, nowunder the authority of the Russian Republic, are honoring a$5 billion diamond sales contract, he says. De Beers receivedrepayments of $200 million on time this year, Mr Ralfe says.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Oil market participants will be looking to see if crudeand petroleum products will continue their declines from lastweek. Prices have been falling on worries that world-widedemand will remain sluggish into next quarter because of therecession. In addition, traders say, the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries may be producing more oil thanmany people had thought. Market participants this week maystill be absorbing the latest demand estimates from theParis-based International Energy Agency, which slashed thesize of increases it expects in oil demand for next year. Theagency expects demand in the first half to average 300,000barrels a day less than it was projecting just a month ago.Furthermore, the IEA estimated that OPEC's November outputaveraged 24.1 million barrels daily, the most since March1990. In trading Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange,crude for January delivery fell 35 cents a barrel, to $20.04,the lowest the prompt month contract has been since lastJune. While traders aren't expecting any quick reversal, theywill be closely monitoring whether an early December blast ofcold weather in parts of the country remains.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders will focus Wednesday on whether the AgricultureDepartment revises upward its U.S. wheat export estimate toreflect the recent food aid package for the Soviet Union.   Some traders are speculating that the department mightraise its estimate of U.S. wheat exports for the year endingMay 31 to roughly 1.3 billion bushels from its one-month-oldestimate of 1.125 billion bushels.   The Soviets have earmarked 40% of a package of $1.25billion of U.S.-government backed loan guarantees to buy U.S.wheat. Last week, the Soviet Union reportedly exhausted thefirst allocation of $600 million in loan guarantees to buywheat, corn, soybean meal and soybean oil.   According to Warren King, an analyst at Cargill InvestorServices Inc., Chicago, traders also expect the AgricultureDepartment to reduce its estimate of U.S. wheat stockpiles toreflect wheat shipments to the Soviet Union. Some futurestrading firms already are predicting that the U.S. wheatstockpile will slip to roughly 400 million bushels on May 31,the lowest point of the year. After that date, the hard redwinter wheat harvest in June begins to rebuild U.S. stocks.   Before the food aid package, the Agriculture Departmentwas predicting that U.S. wheat stockpiles would fall to 514million bushels, the lowest level since the mid1970s.   The government's supply and demand report on major cropsis slated for release after the close of trading Wednesday.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Prices might continue to fall this week, said RichardHirsch, vice president of Sharps Pixley in New York.   Copper for December delivery tumbled nearly four cents apound last week. December copper ended at 98.9, up 0.40 centson Friday. The actively traded March contract finished at98.5 cents, up 0.05 cent.   Although certain technical indicators show pricesbottoming near current levels, other technicals point tolower prices, Mr. Hirsch said. And weakening industrialproduction world-wide means copper fundamentals are stillbearish, he added.   Seasonally, the next few weeks are &quot;miserable for demandand production,&quot; he said. But prices may begin to pick up inlate December and build to a peak in February and March ascopper users buy supplies ahead of the busy May-to-Julyperiod when housing construction and automobile productionpick up steam, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
