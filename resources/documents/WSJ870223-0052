Regan, sources close to the White House said.    &quot;The president has decided that he is ready to make a change at the top,&quot; one Reagan confidant said. Mr. Regan's departure from the White House may come as early as this week, this source added.    Last night, it wasn't clear whether Mr. Regan already had formally offered his resignation or had been asked to leave.    Growing numbers of political advisers have been urging the president to replace Mr. Regan as the only way to restore order and momentum to the paralyzed administration. In the past two weeks, the pressure has been increased considerably by first lady Nancy Reagan, whose criticism of Mr. Regan has erupted into an open feud.    Mr. Regan has been under pressure to step down since late November, when the administration became embroiled in controversy over its secret arms sales to Iran and the diversion of some of the resulting profits to Nicaraguan rebels. But the chief of staff, who has grown close to the president, has held on.    Mrs. Reagan has disagreed sharply with the chief of staff on how active the president should be following his recent prostate surgery, according to Reagan supporters who asked that their names not be used.    In addition, sources close to Mrs. Reagan said the first lady is incensed over the role Mr. Regan apparently played in convincing President Reagan to change his testimony on an important issue to the Tower Commission investigating the Iran-Contra affair. The panel's report on the controversy, due to be released Thursday, is widely expected to be critical of the chief of staff.    But despite the growing clamor for Mr. Regan's resignation, aides to the chief of staff continued to insist yesterday that he hasn't any plans to leave.    Blaming the speculation on &quot;press hysteria,&quot; one Regan aide said yesterday that Mr. Regan was &quot;absolutely not going to leave.&quot; The White House press spokesman, Dan Howard, said: &quot;I know of no plans for Mr. Regan to resign.&quot; Mr. Regan couldn't be reached for comment.    John Herrington, energy secretary, and former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, now president of Union Pacific Corp., are considered to be leading candidates for Mr. Regan's job.    Other possible candidates include former Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt; a former White House congressional affairs director, Kenneth Duberstein; Labor Secretary William Brock, Education Secretary William Bennett, and Treasury Secretary James Baker, who served as chief of staff in Mr. Reagan's first term. Mr. Baker is described as reluctant to return to the White House job, however.    Sources close to Mrs. Reagan said the first lady believes Mr. Regan has put protecting himself in the Iran-Contra affair ahead of serving the president. It was after a meeting with Mr. Regan, for instance, that the president changed his testimony to the Tower Commission in a way that backed up Mr. Regan's version of events.    On Jan. 26, the president told the panel he recalled giving general, advance approval for Israeli sales of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985. That account was consistent with testimony by former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane. But on Feb. 11, after meeting with Mr. Regan, the president suggested he hadn't given prior approval for the 1985 sales -- a version of events Mr. Regan had told congressional investigators.    Mrs. Reagan also has confided to friends that she blames Mr. Regan for disclosing to Senate investigators that the president keeps regular notes. At first, Mr. Regan suggested the notes wouldn't be made available to investigators. He subsequently was overruled by the president, who made portions of them available to the Tower panel -- but not without a considerable amount of friction between the White House and the commission. </TEXT></DOC>
