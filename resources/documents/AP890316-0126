The study also said that, on average, one out of six accidentvictims hiring lawyers was steered to a particular doctor or clinicby the lawyer, and said that people represented by lawyers hiresubstantially more chiropractors, physical therapists andpsychotherapists.   The findings came from a study of 46,694 injury claims paid by 34insurance companies in the spring and summer of 1987.   Those companies sell nearly 60 percent of U.S. auto insurance.The claims were made under five coverages: bodily injury liability,uninsured and underinsured motorists, personal injury protection andmedical payment.   ``States with high attorney involvement tend to have high autoinjury costs, and states with low attorney involvement tend to havelow auto injury costs,'' said the study conducted by theAll-Industry Research Advisory Council, a group of insuranceindustry trade associations and companies.   At the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, whose members areplaintiff attorneys in personal injury cases, spokeswoman MadelineApplebaum said no one had seen the study and she could not comment.   The insurance group found that almost 45 percent of claimantshired lawyers, up from more than 31 percent in 1977. The groupspeculated that the ending of restrictions on advertising by lawyersin 1978 might have helped cause the increase.   The average bodily injury claim payment increased 139 percent inthose 10 years, well ahead of the 85 percent increase in theConsumer Price Index.   After noting a 124 percent increase in the cost of medical care,the study said, ``Another possible reason for the large incurease inauto injury costs is that attorney involvement has increased 42percent since 1977.''</TEXT></DOC>
