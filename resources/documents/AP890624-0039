The Florida Legislature was called into special session this weekafter a string of accidental shootings left three children dead. Theshootings reversed long-standing opposition to toughening thestate's liberal gun laws.   ``We used to sell maybe four or five trigger locks for every 100guns,'' said Ray Ribas, assistant manager at Tamiami Gun and RangeShops in Miami. ``Now it seems everyone wants one.''   Gun locks work by immobilizing the trigger. Some consist only ofplastic straps, while lock-and-key units sell for $8 to $12. Somegun owners are opting for more costly vaults with a key orcombination lock.   ``There's a whole new awareness about guns, and that can onlylead to less accidents,'' said Ribas.   WJNO-AM in West Palm Beach distributed more than 500 gun locksfree last week at two shopping malls.   ``People have been calling the station asking where they can getmore,'' said WJNO producer Rebecca Wynne. ``People are very aware ofthe new law.''   Southern Gun and Tackle, a Florida-based nationwide gundistributor, said gun lock orders have more than doubled in the pastmonth.   ``We've proposed to the dealers that they offer the lock withevery gun they sell,'' said Al Russell, manager of the company'spurchasing department.   Under the statute, gun owners who fail to secure loaded weaponsin homes or businesses could face a third-degree felony charge if achild 15 years old or younger shoots someone. The charge carries amaximum prison sentence of five years and a $5,000 fine.   Lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun inpublic or threatens others with the weapon.   The bill was drafted with the help of the National RifleAssociation and would take effect Oct. 1 once signed by Gov. BobMartinez. Police officers and military personnel are exempted as arecases in which the guns were obtained illegally, such as a burglary.   A call for similar gun-control action was made Friday byWisconsin Lt. Gov. Scott McCallum following shootings involvingchildren in that state.   Master Lock Co., one of the nation's largest gun lock makers,distributes 220,000 to 250,000 locks each year, said spokesman TomCampbell at the company's Milwaukee headquarters. He said sales wereincreasing.   ``Unfortunately, sales increases often follow catastrophes suchas accidental shootings,'' he said.   ``I've always encouraged my customers to buy trigger locks. Ittook killings to convince some people they are really needed,'' saidBuddy Cook, manager of Gunrunner Inc. in Tallahassee.   At Wain Roberts Firearms in St. Petersburg, clerk Darin Paultonsaid a case of 24 trigger locks used to last about six months.   ``We've sold four cases since word of the law first came out,''he said. ``These things sold very sparingly before. Now, they arereally moving.''</TEXT></DOC>
