The closures of the Cannery Creek Hatchery and Esther Island fisheries -- areas that had thus far remained free of oil -- came as a &quot;big nasty blow&quot; to the sound's fishing fleet, which had already seen 30% of its salmon grounds closed because of oil pollution, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said.    The closures are likely to cost fishermen much of an estimated $16 million in pink salmon harvests and put in jeopardy a substantial catch of silver salmon that are due to begin spawning later this month. The sound's commercial herring season, with a catch valued at about $12 million, had previously been canceled because of the oil spill. The shutdowns of Cannery Creek and Esther Island leave only one relatively minor fishery, known as the Copper River Flats, open to commercial salmon harvests.    &quot;People are really disappointed,&quot; said Marilyn Leland, executive director of the Cordova District Fishermen United, a fishery group headquartered at Cordova on the eastern edge of Prince William Sound. Nonetheless, Ms. Leland said fishermen support the decisions by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to close the areas under a &quot;zero tolerance program&quot; designed to prevent any oil-tainted fish from reaching market. The fear is that even a small number of contaminated salmon could undermine the value and reputation of the overall Alaska salmon harvest, which last year carried a retail value of about $3 billion.    The Prince William Sound closures represent only a fraction of the commercial fishing areas put off limits as a result of the 260,000-barrel spill, which has sent oil roaming hundreds of miles into the Gulf of Alaska. Large swaths of fishing grounds in the gulf near Seward and Kodiak Island, and in Cook Inlet near Homer, have also been closed and will remain so probably for the rest of the summer fishing season. Fisheries officials say they don't yet have any reliable estimates of losses, though they will likely run in the tens of millions of dollars.    The new closures amount to more bad news for Exxon Corp., which announced last week that it will spend about $1.25 billion, excluding litigation costs or court awards, cleaning up Prince William Sound and settling damage claims. Of $600 million already spent, Exxon has paid out $38 million in damage claims, including some for fishing losses. </TEXT></DOC>
