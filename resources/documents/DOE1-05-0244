LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD-100) thermoluminescent dosimeterswere chosen for measuring doses on the patient. Cards were designed onwhich instructions are given for the placement of the dosimeters on thepatient and for the registration of TL responses. Patient particularsand exposure parameters are also recorded. The dose information concerningexcretory urography examinations was obtained for a number of patientsfrom two X-ray units at hospital A and one unit at hospital B. It wasassumed that the entrance skin dose which was measured on the inner thigh,opposite the testes, was directly related to the testes dose. Entranceskin dose on the anterior superior iliac spine did not correlate withovary dose, and exposures on female patients were therefore simulatedon a Rando phantom utilising TL chips. Pairs of dosimeters were exposed- the first in the center of the field on the phantom, and the secondinternally on the position of the ovary. The ratio between the TL responsesfor each pair of dosimeters, and the TL response/100 mAs of the surfacedosimeter, was established at the various tube voltages, field sizesand positions normally used on patients. From this information, and withknowledge of the exposure parameters on each patient, ovary doses couldbe calculated. With this study the preliminary steps have been laid downfor the determination of the genetically significant dose from diagnosticradiography in the RSA.</TEXT></DOC>
