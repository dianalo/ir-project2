Central to the study is a survey ofemissions from over 400 midwest USA power plant boilers, attempting toidentify the technologies most suitable for controlling these plants'sulfur emissions and to quantify the costs of using these technologies.A midwestern sulfur dioxide abatement program aimed at reducing acidgas emmisions by 50-67% from 1985 would cost the USA about $6-12 billionin capital expenses, if the least-cost strategy described in the analysisis employed. Such an effort would be close in effectiveness to what amoderate national acid rain law would achieve, and the cost would beless than that spent on facilities to clean up the Great Lakes from 1973-84.Scrubbers would be the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions onthe large boilers which produce most of the region's emissions. Eventualcommercialization of one class of clean coal technologies, i.e. retrofitsystems, could be even more cost effective. The most effective firststep would be to employ conventional scrubbers targeted at those midwesternboilers that emit the most acid gas. Implementation of this strategyis legislatively possible under the existing US Clean Air Act, whichalso has a transboundary provision. Such strategies encouraged by Canadaand cooperating northeast states could be the basis for significant emissionsreduction in the few states that contribute most to acid rain in Canada,at only a fraction of the cost of a national US acid rain control program.5 refs., 7 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
