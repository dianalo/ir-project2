Industrial production in May was down a revised 4.5% from April, mainly because of an unusually large number of vacation days.    In June, production was boosted by construction activity, which rose almost 5%, and by the energy sector, where production gained 5.6%, the ministry said. The figures are adjusted for inflation and seasonal factors. </TEXT></DOC>
