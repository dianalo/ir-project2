An &quot;undesirable situation&quot; has arisen in the nickel cash-market, the exchange board said in announcing that members with &quot;short&quot; positions -- committed to delivering metal -- may delay delivery if they have to. But members must pay a significant penalty of $150 a ton for every day delivery is delayed.    Cash-market nickel prices closed at the equivalent of $5.22 a pound Friday, compared with $3.80 at the end of 1987 and $1.60 in January. Cash-market nickel has been trading at a substantial premium over futures prices, which on Friday closed at $3.91 a pound.    Some traders fear a cash-market supply &quot;squeeze&quot; is developing, caused by one or two merchants trying to corner the market, said Mo Ahmadzadeh, president of the New York office of Rudolf Wolff andamp; Co., metals brokers. William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York, added: &quot;It's a healthy market to start with from a supply/demand standpoint -- but not as healthy as the past few days. It's a genuine squeeze.&quot;    The London Metal Exchange, however, said it suspected the problem was due to natural physical tightness rather than an artificial squeeze.    Traders, meanwhile, are anxiously awaiting to see if this morning's weekly inventory report shows another fall in stockpiles. Last Monday, stocks dropped 10% from the week earlier, to 2,754 tons, down 252 tons.    Analysts had been predicting higher prices this year, though not this high. Demand from the stainless-steel industry is one of the bullish factors. There also have been a number of supply disruptions world-wide.    Nickel isn't traded in the U.S. However, analysts cited big nickel purchases by the U.S. Mint as helping the metal's price rises. Eugene Essner, the mint's deputy director, said that while he has heard the speculation, mint purchases were up only &quot;slightly,&quot; because of increased coin demand. &quot;We haven't been buying any more nickel recently than we've been buying all along,&quot; Mr. Essner said. </TEXT></DOC>
