The Radioactive Waste Campaign, a self-styled public interestgroup based in New York City, made the recommendation in a letterto members of Congress. The letter was released the same day thegroup released a 170-page report which charged there are dangerouslevels of radioactive pollution at all 16 of the EnergyDepartment's main production facilities for nuclear weapons.   The two-year study by nine researchers concluded there is ``apattern of gross mismanagement by the department, which is allowingradioactivity to leak out of the sites through soil, water and air_ in many cases intentionally.''   Many of the problems cited by the report have long beenacknowledged by the Energy Department and have been the subjects ofseveral blistering reviews by the General Accounting Office. Butthe independent study is the most wide-ranging report yet publishedon the issue and suggests cleanup costs will exceed the EnergyDepartment's estimate of $100 billion.   The Energy Department referred calls on the subject to theoffice of an official who was not immediately available for commentTuesday.   Among key examples of contamination cited by the report:   _At the Hanford Reservation in southeastern Washington, billionsof gallons of radioactive water are routinely pumped into theground each year. An underground plume of radioactivity stretchessix miles to the Columbia River, one of the world's premier salmonruns and an irrigation source for two states.   _At the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, millions ofgallons of radioactive fluids are poured into seepage basinsactually designed to leak at a steady rate. Strontium-90, which cancause bone cancer and leukemia, is entering surface water at rates43,000 times above the government's standard for drinking water.The report charges further that Atlanta's water supply isthreatened by toxic chemicals from the site.   _At the Feed Material Production Center in Fernald, Ohio,uranium is contaminating suburban Cincinnati's water supply.   _At the Nevada Test Site, underground nuclear explosions arecontaminating underground water supplies, and radioactive fallouthas drifted as far as Salt Lake City.   _Plutonium, one of the most carcinogenic materials known, hasbeen dispersed into the air or water at weapons facilities nearDayton, Ohio; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Denver.   _At Oak Ridge, Tenn., where three plants are based, ``35 millionpounds of uranium are sitting in the ground, so there's uranium inthe runoff in streams and a large amount of uranium put into theair,'' Resnikoff said. That's the largest store of uranium anywherein the country, he said.   The group, in its letter to Congress, also called for animmediate halt to dumping of radioactive wastes into the ground,and urged the weapons sites be given top priority for clean-up. Italso called for creation of an independent oversight agency for theweapons plants.   The 16 sites covered by the study are:   _Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C.   _Three facilities at Oak Ridge, Tenn.: The Y-12 plant, Oak RidgeNational Laboratory, Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant.   _Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Portsmouth, Ohio.   _Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio.   _Mound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio.   _Paducah, Ky., Gaseous Diffusion Plant.   _Pantex Plant, Amarillo, Texas.   _Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, N.M.   _Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque, N.M.   _Rocky Flats Plant outside Denver.   _Nevada Test Site about 100 miles from Las Vegas, Nev.   _Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, Calif.   _Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho Falls, Idaho.   _Hanford Reservation in Hanford, Wash.   Marvin Resnikoff, a nuclear physicist, said the nine whoperformed the study reviewed several hundred Energy Departmentdocuments and visited some of the sites.   The Radioactive Waste Campaign issues a quarterly newspaper thatis sent to 13,000 members. It has five full-time staff members andsome part-time workers, Resnikoff said.</TEXT></DOC>
