The company's stock rose sharply yesterday, gaining $5 ashare to $39.50 in national over-the-counter-trading.</LP><TEXT>   The patent raises immediate hopes for enhanced treatmentsfor cancer, genetic diseases and immune deficiencies. But italso turns up heat surrounding debate over the ability topatent basic building blocks of life for profit.   The biotechnology company has been best-known for its workin developing a research animal endowed with a human immunesystem as a research tool -- the so-called SCID-hu mouse. Butthe new claim is likely to gain more notoriety for foundingscientist Irving Weissman and his team that includes CharlesBaum, Bruno Peault, Ann Tsukamoto, and Yukow Aihara.   &quot;It's very important,&quot; said New York patent attorneyLeslie Misrock. &quot;If you do something to a cell, such aspurifying it, even a seed or a bacterium is patentable.&quot;However, he said purification must lend a new or enhancedpower to the invention to withstand legal challenge.   &quot;It's hard to imagine that one could patent a cell,&quot; saidresearcher Jerome Groopman of the New England DeaconessHospital in Boston. &quot;Stem cells aren't yet well-characterizedin terms of the switches that trigger their maturation. Soit's hard to imagine {a single patent} could encompass all ofthat.&quot;   But, he added: &quot;If it were true, it would be a verypowerful patent.&quot;   Controversy seems guaranteed to follow the Systemixpatent. Several groups, including the laboratory of MalcolmMoore at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New Yorkand Amgen Inc. in Thousand Oaks, Calif., are known to beworking intently on stem cells. Other cancer researchers areworking on different versions of such cells to treat tumors.   Indeed, Systemix wasted no time in serving notice it willprosecute the patent &quot;as aggressively as possible,&quot; accordingto Linda Sonntag, the company's president. Since the patentcovers both the process of purifying the cells and theirbasic composition, she said: &quot;It doesn't matter what processpeople use, they will always be infringing.&quot;   All blood cells in the body develop from stem cells,including red blood cells, white blood cells of the immunesystem such as T and B lymphocytes, and platelets. Incrediblyprimitive, yet protean, they have the power to perpetuallyrenew themselves, as well as give rise to all the elements ofmature blood cells. Yet they comprise only one-half of 1% ofthe bone marrow, and have been extremely difficult to isolatein their pure form.   Purified stem cells could readily lead to enhancedversions of bone marrow transplants for cancer, experts said.To date, the company has tested the stem cells in hundreds oflethally irradiated mice, and the cure rate has been 100%,Dr. Sonntag said. Initial human clinical trials are beingplanned using stem cells to try to restore the blood ofpatients whose bone marrow has been destroyed by radiation orchemotherapy.   &quot;This is really going to make people sit up and takenotice,&quot; predicted Samuel Broder, director of the NationalCancer Institute. &quot;It will shape a whole new era of moderntransplantation.&quot;   Currently, bone marrow transplants are used toreconstitute the blood after intense chemotherapy orradiation. Thousands of patients with leukemia and lymphomareceive them each year, and they are being experimentallyused to treat advanced tumors of the breast and brain.   Using purified stem cells in place of a whole bone marrowtransplant would weed out elements of the marrow that now cancause rejection, or graft-vs.-host disease, complicationsthat can bring about transplant failure. It would also lessenchances of a stray cancer cell invading the therapeutictransplant to reseed a tumor.   Another major target of stem cells is the treatment ofinherited disease, Systemix said.   &quot;Stem cells are the holy grail of gene therapy,&quot; Dr.Sonntag said. &quot;They might have special relevance for certainbloodborne inherited diseases, such as Severe Combined ImmuneDeficiency or adenosine deaminase deficiency,&quot; two lethalforms of inherited immunodeficiency.   Some researchers doubt the patent will stand. &quot;Patents areinvitations to lawsuits,&quot; said David Golde, the head ofhematologic oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering CancerCenter in New York. &quot;My own belief is it won't stand up. Themethod of purification may stand up, but not the basiccomposition of {stem cells}. Next thing you know, someonewill patent a zygote, and you won't be able to have a babywithout a license.&quot;   Several researchers pointed out that stem cells were firstdiscovered decades ago by Canadian researchers. Moreover,cancer researcher Roland Mertelsmann of Freiburg Universityin West Germany has been using chemotherapy to drive stemcells into the peripheral blood, where he can capture themfor treatment of breast cancer.   But Systemix said it believes its stem cells are vastlymore pure and long-lasting than all others previouslyisolated by existing methods.</TEXT></DOC>
