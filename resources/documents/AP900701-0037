The 69-year-old Viegas cycles long distances and talks to peopleeven farther away at the same time with the ham radio he installedon his bicycle.   He said he surprises and confuses some of those he reaches as herides along and sends out his greeting: ``Hello, this is WJ5,bicycle mobile.''   With his bicycle radio, he has talked to people as far away asNew York and Minnesota.   ``I put out a pretty good signal, and the guys hear me, and Iget a pile of them wanting to talk to me,'' Viegas said.   Shortly after retiring from LTV Corp. about 10 years ago, Viegastook up cycling. He also began tinkering in his workshop at home.   ``I decided that I didn't want to spend all of my time inthere,'' he said. ``So I thought that I would try to rig a hamradio for my bike.''   Viegas had to figure out what kind of regulator to use for thevoltage provided by a generator on the back tire of his 12-speed.But once he did, he began beaming out his signal.   ``I rode 4,000 miles last year,'' Viegas said. ``When I'mriding, I'll talk to people and tell them that I am riding a bikeand can't write their names. I ask them to send me a card.''   Plenty of cooperative hams have done just that. Cards line awall in Viegas' home from points in the world that he has reached.   One from Fulton, N.Y., reads: ``Herb, you are my first bicyclemobile contact. You have a great signal and you'd never know thatyou were on a bike.''</TEXT></DOC>
