A body-fittedmoving curvilinear coordinate system is adopted to deal with the complexcontour of the nozzle and the moving boundary of the ablation surface.The concept of equivalent heat capacity is also used to unify the energybalance equations of the control volume for all different material layerswhich makes the moving boundary caused by pyrolysis process inside thematerial easy to handle. A sample calculation for an experimental solidmotor nozzle indicates that the numerical results of the temperaturedistribution agree with the measured data fairly well. This method canbe applied to engineering design. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
