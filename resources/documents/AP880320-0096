He declined to give details on the Sandinista pullback or bemore specific on when the U.S. troops that arrived last week woulddepart.   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., a member of a congressionaldelegation visiting Honduras, said he expects the U.S. militarypersonnel to pull out in about a week.   ``I think it'll all be over by then,'' said Montgomery, a memberof the House Armed Services Committee.   American soldiers practiced military maneuvers Sunday at aHonduran airstrip about 20 miles from the Nicaraguan border.   ``These guys are not going to get involved in any sort ofconflict,'' said Maj. Gary Hovatter, spokesman for U.S. troops inthe Central American nation.   Nicaragua formally protested the Honduran air raid Saturday asan unwarranted act of aggression. It has denied that its troopscrossed the jungle-choked border between the nations.   The U.S. House delegation observed a military exercise involvingU.S. infantrymen and Honduran soldiers at Jamastran, a dirtairstrip about 55 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa and 20 miles fromthe border.   The exercise was held about 80 miles south of the Bocay borderregion.   Honduran officials said Saturday's air strike was carried outbecause about 600 Sandinista soldiers were moving too slowly fromthe Bocay area. Two Honduran jet fighters carried out a similarraid Thursday.   No one was hurt in either raid and no damage was reported inSaturday's attack.   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto sent a protest noteto Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez, saying his government``energetically and formally protests'' Saturday's attack, which itcalled ``aggression against Nicaraguan territory.''   Honduras said the attack took place eight miles inside Honduras.Nicaragua claims it was five miles inside Nicaragua.   The Nicaraguan ministry also said two F-5 warplanes flew overSandinista positions Saturday morning in the frontier sectors ofMukuwas, San Andres de Bocay, Waniwas and Wayawas, but did notattack.   The 600 Sandinistas were part of a force estimated at 2,000 thatwas believed to have entered Honduran territory last week inpursuit of U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras.   The action prompted President Reagan to send in U.S. troops tonon-combat areas for military exercises in a show of force to theleftist government.   In Washington, national security adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powellsaid the fighting between Nicaragua and Honduras was essentiallyover.   Powell, who appeared on ABC-TV's ``This Week With DavidBrinkley,'' said the U.S. military exercises should be completedshortly and the troops will return to the United States.   He said ``The Sandinistas have withdrawn. They're apparently ontheir side of the border again. They appear to be in a process ofwithdrawing or have withdrawn.''   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has denied that theSandinistas were in Honduran territory.   On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco saidreports that Sandinista troops remained inside Honduras territorywas a ruse by the Reagan administration to obtain more money forthe Contras.   Tinoco also said Monday's first-ever direct talks with Contrarebels inside Nicaragua will focus on the mechanics of acease-fire. The Contras want the talks to include political issues.   In New York, the eight-nation Contadora and its support groupissued a statement condemning the sending of additional Americantroops to Honduras.   They also urged both the Honduran and Nicaraguan governments``to reduce immediately tension in their border region and respecteach others' territorial integrity.''   Contadora is made up of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Panamaand is backed by a support group formed by Argentina, Brazil,Uruguay and Peru.   The group has been trying to negotiate an end to the Contra warin Nicaragua and leftist guerrilla wars in El Salvador andGuatemala for the past six years.   Although it did not mention the United States by name, theContadora statement ``expressed deep worry over the escalation of aforign military presence in ... Honduras.''</TEXT></DOC>
