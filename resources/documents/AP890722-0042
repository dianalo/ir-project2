China's State Education Commission said freshman universityenrollment nationwide would be cut by 30,000 from the plannedenrollment of 640,000. It said the cut was necessary because manyschools have been enrolling more students than they could handle.   It also cited problems with job placements and said somelow-priority majors, including the social sciences, need to be``rectified ... to be in accordance with the needs of the buildingof socialism.''   An admissions official at Beijing University, who did not givehis name, said: ``The universities and colleges whose studentsactively participated in the student movement will cut enrollment.''   Beijing University students were at the forefront of thenow-suppressed movement for greater freedoms.   An admissions official at People's University, who also did notgive his name, said the cuts were ordered ``because of the studentmovement and political reasons, not because there are any problemswith the university.''   Several students at Beijing University, speaking on condition ofanonymity, also said they felt the enrollment cuts were related tothe student movement.   The people in charge of China's propaganda machine, meanwhile,continued to call for a purge of publications that don't toe thesocialist line.   ``News and publishing units, social science research organs,literary and art groups ... must propagate and seriously carry outthe four basic principles,'' the party newspaper, the People'sDaily, said the officials decided.   The four principles in essence declare that China must be ruledonly by the Communist Party under the principles of Marxism,Leninism and Mao Tse-tung. That idea has been part of theideological gospel for a decade under senior leader Deng Xiaoping,but tends to be stressed only in times of suppression on emergentliberalism.   The officials, heads of propaganda departments and culturalcensors natiowide, declared as their five-day meeting ended Fridaythat the cultural market must be ``rectified'' _ meaning shaken up_ and purged of reactionary materials.   Beijing and several other leading cities already have begunraiding book stalls to seize the works of intellectuals who tookpart in the crushed democracy movement.   The coastal city of Fujian announced it has ``rectified'' thevideo games market, pool halls and dance halls and plans to startin on the videotape market.   The message of the propaganda meeting was that such efforts mustbe spread to every town and village, and must not stop with a fewraids as in China's last hard-line political campaign in 1987.   China's culture minister and vice minister, Wang Meng and YingRuochen, were conspicuously absent from the meeting, as they havebeen since the June 3-4 army attack on student-led protesters.   Wang and Ying had advocated a policy that the arts wouldflourish only if political interference was reduced.   The meeting was presided over by the head of the national partyPropaganda Department, Wang Renzhi, at times joined by partyGeneral Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng.   An editorial, apparently produced by the meeting, filled halfthe front page of today's People's Daily. It attacked the popularview in the West that Marxism is outdated and socialism has failed,as witnessed by the troubled economies and restless populations ofthe Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China.   ``For some time political forces in capitalist countries ...have played up the so-called crisis in socialism,'' it said.   Even in China, it said, some people ``publicly declare: theattempt at socialism and its failure is the great legacy of the20th century.'''   The editorial revealed that in early 1987, as China cracked downon an earlier series of student marches for democracy, now-oustedparty leader Zhao Ziyang told a party meeting: ``No one reallyknows what the sociaist road is.''   In another apparent reference to Zhao, it said ``some comradesdid not speak much of the struggle between socialism andcapitalism, as if with one cry of `detente' the boundaries betweensocialism and capitalism would be eradicated. In reality, it is notlike this.''   Public criticism of Zhao has mounted steadily since his June 24ouster from his party posts. Revelations of comments he allegedlymade at closed meetings have been cited to prove his softness onWestern-style liberalism.   None of the articles explain how Zhao managed to winconfirmation in October 1987 as party chief.</TEXT></DOC>
