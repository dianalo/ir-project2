For 20 years, passed since thefirst works on determination of the neutron boundary of the lightestelement stability, a lot of investigations have been carried out. 8 neutron-richnuclei in the quasistationary state: /sup 2/n, /sup 4/n, /sup 4/H, /sup6/H, /sup 5/He, /sup 7/He, /sup 9/He, /sup 10/Li, /sup 13/Be, have found.Besides, 3 nuclei: /sup 3/n, /sup 5/H, /sup 7/H, have been detected neitheras stable nor as quasistationary. Systematic investigation of neutron-richnuclei of helium, hydrogen and polyneutrons in the reactions with heavyions has been carried out in this paper using a magnetic analyser. Classifyingthe neutron binding energy in the lightest element nuclei, one can makethe conclusion that the existence of the /sup 6/n, /sup 8/n, /sup 7/H,/sup 10/He, /sup 12/He, /sup 13/Li stable systems is possible. 7 figs.;1 tab.; 26 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
