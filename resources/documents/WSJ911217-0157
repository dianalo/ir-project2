McGowan, who helped to break up the Bell Systemand establish MCI Communications Corp. as American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph Co.'s main rival, has given up his duties aschief executive officer.   Mr. McGowan, whose move was expected, passed his title toBert C. Roberts Jr., 49 years old, who will continue aspresident and chief operating officer. Mr. McGowan willremain chairman and &quot;play an active role in overall policydecisions,&quot; a spokesman said.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. McGowan, 64, successfully came back from hearttransplant surgery in 1987 to lead MCI through some of itsmost turbulent marketing battles with ATandamp;T. Still, the savvy,wisecracking executive who built MCI into the nation'ssecond-largest long-distance company while dismissing rivalswith put-downs like &quot;US Splint,&quot; lately has kept a lowprofile. In recent years, Mr. Roberts has been the morepublic senior executive, meeting company employees andarguing MCI's case before regulators and Congress.   Mr. Roberts, who has been president and chief operatingofficer since 1985, said his principal challenge will be tosteer MCI through &quot;a very tough economy&quot; that has slowedgrowth in the long-distance industry to &quot;5% to 6% vs. doubledigits a few years ago.&quot; And he said there are &quot;a lot ofactivities involving possible alliances and ventures . . .that I will push to a conclusion for the benefit of MCI.&quot;   But Mr. Roberts said he's &quot;not in any hurry&quot; to pass hisduties as chief operating officer on to any other MCIexecutives. &quot;We have a very strong management team under me&quot;overseeing MCI's principal business segments, he said.   While MCI's release said Mr. McGowan founded thelong-distance company in 1968, he actually took overMicrowave Communications Inc., a Chicago concern founded byJack Goeken to compete with ATandamp;T for corporate phonecustomers. Mr. McGowan renamed the company MCI and over thenext two decades built it into an international long-distancecompany and ATandamp;T's challenger.</TEXT></DOC>
