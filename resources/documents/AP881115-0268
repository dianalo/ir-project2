The report, ``Energy Security White Paper: U.S. Decisions andGlobal Trends,'' was issued during the group's annual meeting.   The survival of domestic exploration and production is inquestion as lower crude prices discourage investment in new oildevelopment, the report said.   Dependence on foreign oil, primarily from the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, has increased U.S. vulnerability tothe dangers of a supply disruption and price volatility, it said.   Despite recent huge quarterly profits by major oil companies, thegains came in ``downstream'' sectors such as refining and chemicalmanufacturing, said Charles J. DiBona, president of the trade group.But the favorable earnings were offset at least partly by losses in``upstream'' _ production and exploration operations _ stemming fromlow crude prices.   The paper calls for a national energy policy to ensure anadequate and secure supply of oil at reasonable prices whilereducing vulnerability to a future oil crisis.   The report does not specifically call for tax incentives to helpoffset the crude prices, but contends correct ``governmentdecisions'' could increase domestic oil supply by 2 million barrelsa day by the end of the 1990s.   Only 921 oil rigs are working in the United States, compared withabout 1,000 a year ago and 4,000 in 1981, the group noted. Thoserigs are producing approximately 8 million barrels of oil a day andoutput is falling 3 percent a year while demand is rising about 2percent annually, the report said.   Consequently, foreign imports have soared to 43 percent from 31percent just three years ago and some economists predict that infive years the United States may be importing half of its oil.   The report said dependence on foreign supplies, primarily fromthe Middle East, increased U.S. vulnerability to a supply disruption.   With demand increasing rapidly, the current glut of oil on worldmarkets could dry up in the 1990s, the report said.   ``Then any number of unpredictable developments around thePersian Gulf could directly, swiftly and critically affect oilsupply,'' the paper said.   In addition, another steep plunge in oil prices, like that whichoccurred in 1986, threatens the survival of smaller oil companies,damages the economies of oil states dependent on the industry forrevenue and ``hurts the country's long-term energy security,'' thereport said.</TEXT></DOC>
