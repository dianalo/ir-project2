The demonstrations, held hours before the start of a match, werepart of a nationwide anti-apartheid campaign launched Aug. 2 toprotest segregation and the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, whichexclude the black majority.   In other developments, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu sentletters to four Western leaders, including President Bush,describing the almost daily unrest this month in black andmixed-race townships outside Cape Town.   And the country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federationsmet near Johannesburg to discuss strategies for opposing laws thatlimit worker rights.   Twenty eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel in Cape Townafter meeting briefly with Willie John McBride, manager of theinternational squad made up of Australian, French and Britishplayers.   Several demonstrators carried posters that read ``Mercenaries GoHome'' and ``Apartheid Tour Must Stop.''   Two activists also were arrested when about 30 protestersgathered outside the main Cape Town branch of First National Bank,sponsor of the rugby tour. Bank officials said they have receivedseveral bomb threats in recent days.   The activists were identified as Dawood Khan, a spokesman for theWestern Cape Traders Association, and Willie Hofmeyer, a leader ofthe banned United Democratic Front, the country's largestanti-apartheid coalition.   Police on Friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour. Theinternational team's visit has been denounced by activists as abreach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid.   The International XV squad, whose tour was approved by theInternational Rugby Board, already has played two matches in SouthAfrica. But Saturday's contest was the first against the SouthAfrican national squad, the Springboks.   Rugby is the most popular team sport among white South Africans,who believe their squad would be the best in the world if allowed tocompete regularly on an international level.   Saturday's match, which the Springboks won 20-19, marked thefirst international competition for the South African team since aNew Zealand team made an unsanctioned ``rebel tour'' in 1986.   In most sports, the world governing bodies have barred SouthAfricans from international competition because of apartheid.However, the degree of sanctions varies in each sport.   South Africa has not been allowed to compete in the Olympicssince 1960, and generally its amateur teams have difficulty playingabroad or attracting visitors. In professional sports, South Africaoften lures foreign competitors with huge sums of money in cricket,boxing, golf and tennis.   British cricket players have agreed to a tour in January eventhough they will face an automatic five-year suspension frominternational competition. South Africa also stages an annual golftournament with a $1 million first prize _ the largest of anytournament _ and consistenly draws top players.   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, declined to release details of theletters. But he said Tutu mailed them to Bush, British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterand andWest German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   The clashes between activists and police have escalated steadilysince the launch of the defiance campaign and police blamed twodeaths Friday on rioters.   The two labor federations that met Saturday _ the Congress ofSouth African Trade Unions with 900,000 members, and the smallerNational Council of Trade Unions _ have said they make take protestaction before the elections.   Gen. Hennie de Witt, the police commissioner, imposed tightrestrictions on the meetings, allowing only union members to attend,prohibiting political banners, and restricting discussions to laborissues.   Dozens of police armed with shotguns and tear gas were present atthe meeting attended by 800 delegates.</TEXT></DOC>
