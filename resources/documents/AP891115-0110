We export a lot of things, butnot capitalism,'' chief government spokesman Hans Klein told TheAssociated Press.   Klein also indicated Chancellor Helmut Kohl may postpone acrucial summit with East Germany until after an emergency Dec.15-17 Communist Party congress that could choose a new partyleadership.   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann has proposed a massiveeconomic aid program for East Germany, contingent upon concretereforms in its state-controlled economy.   East Germany has promised sweeping economic reforms, withoutelaborating on specific plans.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned Westerners not togloat over the shaky condition of communism in the East bloc andcautioned that ``exporting capitalism'' could hurt the growingclimate of cooperation in Europe.   On Saturday, Kohl said economic assistance to East Germanycannot be successful unless the ``system of a state-plannedeconomy'' gives way to a ``socially responsible market economy.''   Klein rejected any suggestion that West Germany wanted to imposeits own type of economic system on its Communist neighbor. He saidmajor economic reforms are needed if East Germany expects toattract investors.   ``We say there must be market conditions which make itreasonable to invest there,'' Klein said.   But he shied away from stating flatly that a drastic economicoverhaul in East Germany was a pre-condition for financial aid.   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of the Christian Democrats, saidthere were some ways to help East Germany soon, including renewalof its telephone communications network and environmental projects.   But ``far-reaching changes in the current economic system'' areneeded for East Germany to be able to attract desperately neededprivate investment, Ruehe said.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leader of the FreeDemocratic Party, said Bonn should not set conditions for its aid.He did say reform must show ``definite signals,'' withoutexplaining what the signals should be.   ``We must tell them we are ready to be helpful,'' said JuergenChrobog, Genscher's chief spokesman.   At a news conference earlier in the day, Klein indicated Kohlmay postpone his summit with East German leaders until the end ofDecember.   Kohl initially said he would meet with East German CommunistParty chief Egon Krenz either this month or in early December todiscuss East Germany's direction and possible financial assistance.   But Kohl's latest position is that the meeting will occur``sometime this year,'' Klein said.   That left open the possibility the summit would be put off untilafter the Communist Party emergency congress.   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, plans to fly to EastBerlin on Monday to prepare Kohl's visit. Kohl on Wednesday metwith the heads of eight ministries to discuss the situation in EastGermany.</TEXT></DOC>
