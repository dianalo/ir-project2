(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The rights of eight immigrants accusedof belonging to a Marxist faction of the Palestine LiberationOrganization were not violated during their deportation proceeding,an appellate panel ruled.   The four-member Board of Immigration Appeals rejected theargument that the eight _ seven Jordanians and a Kenyan _ weresubjected to double jeopardy when the government stopped, thenreconvened their deportation hearing last year.   The board Tuesday said the suspended hearing should resume.   The eight, who all live in the Los Angeles area, were arrestedin January 1987 and originally charged under the McCarran-WalterAct with advocating world communism because of their alleged tiesto the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They deniedthe accusation.   The government then modified its charges, accusing two of theeight of subversion and trying to deport the other six on variousimmigration violations.   The immigration judge threw out all the charges May 11, 1987,when the government refused to produce as a witness a keyimmigration official who signed the original arrest warrants.   The next day, the government refiled the charges with thesignature of a different immigration official.   Defense attorneys appealed on the grounds that restarting thehearing was double jeopardy.   But the immigration appeals board said prosecutors were ``notattempting to `start over,''' but rather ``corrected'' thesignature on the arrest orders.   Attorneys for the immigrants said they are considering whetherto appeal the board's decision.</TEXT></DOC>
