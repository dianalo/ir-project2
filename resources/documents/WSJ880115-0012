Today's report on the November U.S. trade deficit is considered pivotal to the course of the dollar's value. It sets up a possible showdown between bearish trader sentiment and the major industrial nations that have advertised their commitment to support the U.S. currency through market intervention.    &quot;It looks like they're getting ready for the storm,&quot; Arnie Sherrer, chief foreign-exchange trader at Royal Bank of Canada, New York, said of recent maneuverings by the U.S. and the other major industrial powers.    Major central banks were absent from the market Thursday with the exception of the Nederlandsche Bank, which intervened to counter a surge in the Dutch currency's value within the European Monetary System, or EMS, traders said.    In place of intervention, however, West German finance officials turned to jawboning yesterday. Traders interpreted the remarks as threats intended to discourage market participants from driving the dollar lower.    Traders said the officials' comments fit into a pattern of government actions this week aimed particularly at countering the widespread negative dollar sentiment going into today's November merchandise trade report. These actions include Wednesday's intervention by nine central banks to prop the dollar and new agreements between the U.S. and Japan providing the Federal Reserve with foreign funds to sell in the interbank market to support the dollar.    &quot;They're showing their hand,&quot; Mr. Sherrer said.    Economists generally expect the U.S. trade deficit to have narrowed to around $15 billion in November from the record $17.63 billion in the previous month. However, traders express concern there could be a rise to $20 billion or more in the November trade gap.    In Frankfurt, a Bundesbank directorate member, Claus Koehler, said major central banks will continue to intervene in currency markets to create expectations of stable exchange rates. Mr. Koehler said the Group of Seven nations that have been supporting the dollar through intervention -- including the U.S., Japan, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and West Germany -- want to make fear of interventions a key factor in the market. &quot;If the central banks don't stand up and show themselves in the market, then other factors are driving speculation, like rumors and certain statements,&quot; he said.    Additionally, in Bonn, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said recent statements by high-ranking U.S. officials make clear that the U.S. doesn't want the dollar to decline further. In a joint statement Wednesday, President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said further declines would be &quot;counterproductive.&quot;    Most of the dollar's losses yesterday came after Morgan Stanley released a forecast by its chief economist, John Paulus, calling for the dollar to fall as low as 110 yen by year end. In late New York trading, the dollar sank 1% to 126.05 yen, from 127.30 yen Wednesday. The dollar also fell 0.5% to 1.6290 West German marks from 1.6375 marks.    The absence of central bank intervention to counter yesterday's dollar decline may indicate that officials expect, or have knowledge that today's trade report will help out the U.S. currency, some dealers said. &quot;I keep asking myself why the central banks would pull back and let the dollar come off again. They must know the trade figure is going to be a little better than the market expects,&quot; said Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign-exchange manager at European American Bank, New York.    On the other hand, some dealers believe that efforts by officials to publicize their plans to defend the dollar may mean that they expect the trade report to disappoint the market. &quot;They must know something if they're preparing for the worst. That's in the back of some people's minds,&quot; said Mr. Sherrer of Royal Bank.    The only central bank activity reported yesterday occurred in Amsterdam, according to traders, where the Nederlandsche Bank sold guilders to buy about $200 million dollars in an effort to counter a recent surge in the guilder's value against the West German mark. Official efforts to prop up the U.S. currency earlier this week and last week resulted in heavy central bank selling of marks to buy dollars. These mark sales produced the side effect of weakening the West German currency against its counterparts within the EMS, a mechanism for managing exchange rates between eight nations within set trading ranges.    The Dutch central bank also trimmed its key money-market intervention rate to 4.2% from 4.4%, another step which should reduce incentives for holding guilders in favor of other European currencies.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $6.80 an ounce to $487 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $485.75 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Thursday, Jan. 14, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
