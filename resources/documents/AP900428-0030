REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Factional fightingbetween Mohawk bands who disagree over whether gambling should beallowed here sent hundreds of residents fleeing the reservationstraddling the U.S.-Canada border.   The St. Regis Mohawk Reservation had the look of a war zoneFriday. Burned cars lined the roads, many buildings had bulletholes or broken windows and residents, including children, werearmed with guns or baseball bats.   Gov. Mario Cuomo so far has refused to send New York StatePolice or National Guardsmen to restore order, despite pleas fromone Indian leader and some outsiders.   ``We want this situation resolved,'' Cuomo said. ``We're workingvery hard to figure out how to do it. I think what we've done sofar, what the state police have done so far, has been appropriate.''   Residents of the reservation just south of the St. LawrenceRiver have been divided for months over the presence of gamblingcasinos and bingo halls on the American side that draw thousands ofnon-Indian visitors.   The U.S. government has declared the gambling halls illegal, butthe Mohawks don't recognize federal or state jurisdiction on thereservation.   In recent weeks, the feud has exploded into violence, withgambling opponents setting up armed blockades of roads leading tothe reservation and sounds of gunfire nightly.   Pro-gambling Mohawks tore down the blockades in a bloody battleTuesday night. On Thursday night, four opponents of gambling wereinjured, one seriously, when they were beaten with baseball bats.Authorities said another person, an observer invited byanti-gambling forces, was missing.   Amid further violence, about 400 evacuees were taken on bargesFriday to Cornwall, Ontario, where they were housed overnight in anarmy transport center.   About 5,000 Mohawks live in the Canadian sector of thereservation and authorities estimated that at least 2,000 will beevacuated. The reservation's total population is about 14,000.   Police said the reservation was quiet Friday night.   But this weekend the casinos are to reopen for the first timesince the roadblocks were removed, and authorities feared violencewould flare anew.   Mike Mitchell, chief of the Canadian Mohawk Council, said hedecided to evacuate women, children and the elderly from thereservation Friday because of the previous trouble.   ``Everybody was in a state of fear,'' Mitchell said. ``Icouldn't see another night of putting people through that. ...Violence all night, machine gunfire ... every five minutes gunfireall over the village.''   Security was tight on a bridge across the Canadian borderleading to Cornwall. Local police armed with shotguns stopped carsleaving and entering the bridge, asking for identification andsearching suspicious vehicles for weapons.   Cornwall Constable Scott Hanton said police had heard reportsthat weapons might be smuggled into the evacuation center.   ``We're in a heck of a situation,'' he said. ``We don't have anyjurisdiction on the reservation, and we're stuck in the middle ofit.''   On the American side of the bridge, state police and U.S.Customs officials also stopped cars and checked for weapons.   Barbara Barnes, an opponent of gambling, said some of theresidents of the American side of the reservation were also scared.   ``I think anybody who has bullets coming at them should bescared,'' she said. ``It's been a very harrowing experience.''   Barnes said some people had voluntarily left their homes andgone to live with friends or relatives off the reservation.   Barnes criticized the governor for refusing to get involved.   ``We have to have law enforcement here,'' she said. ``We can'tcontinue with this lawlessness. Any non-Indian community youwouldn't have what's happened here.''   The Canadian Embassy in Washington has contacted the U.S. StateDepartment Thursday to underline concerns about the violence andthe lack of U.S. policing on the reserve.   ``We made no specific suggestions, but our government finds thesituation alarming and we are concerned that something needs to bedone,'' said Patricia Low-Bedard, a spokeswoman for the CanadianDepartment of External Affairs.   On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of theselect committee on Indian affairs, wrote Cuomo expressing hisconcern about the ``most grave situation'' at St. Regis.</TEXT></DOC>
