Soviet Pvt. Andrei Lopukh, 20, said at a news conference thatanti-Communist rebel authorities warned him if he didn't say he hadconverted to Islam and wanted to stay with them, ``It would be allover.''   Lopukh and Pvt. Valery Prokapchuk were released to their mothersMonday in an emotional ceremony in the Pakistani frontier city ofPeshawar, near the Afghan border.   They were traded for 33 prisoners who had fought with therebels. Soviet and rebel officials called the exchange a goodwillgesture.   In their first public appearance since returning to the SovietUnion, the soldiers told reporters they were not mistreatedphysically but that they had to convert to Islam or face death.   Lopukh said he prayed five times a day and read the Koran but``I didn't really accept Islam.''   Iona Andronov, spokesman for a group of POW families that helpednegotiate the release, said hat ``accepting Islam is no betrayal ofthe motherland.''   Both young men, who were held for more than a year, said theywere unarmed when they were captured _ Lopukh when he left camp togo after a watermelon he had seen in bushes and Prokapchuk when hewandered away to look around and got lost.   Prokapchuk said he tried to escape and was beaten.   Rebel fighters have intermittently released Soviet prisonersduring the 10-year war in Afghanistan.   In December 1979, Moscow sent more than 100,000 combat troopsinto Afghanistan to replace one Communist government with anotherand crush a growing Moslem insurgency.   The Soviets completed their pullout in February. Moscow says 310men are still missing, but the rebels say they are holding no morethan 75.   The Soviet Union continues to fund the Afghan government againstthe U.S.-supported rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
