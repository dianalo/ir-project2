In both polls, Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats and theirBavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, lagged behindopposition Social Democrats.   One poll gave the Social Democrats and leftist Greens enoughvotes to form a governing coalition.   A poll released by the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel saidKohl's party would receive 38 percent of votes if national electionswere held Sunday.   Elections are scheduled for December 1990.   According to Der Spiegel, the Social Democrats would get 41percent and the Greens 8 percent. The Free Democrats, Kohl's juniorcoalition partner, came out with 9 percent.   The Emnid Institute conducted the survey for the magazine,polling 2,000 voters over 16 days ending Feb. 18. The magazine didnot give the margin of error.   A poll released in advance Saturday by Bild am Sontag Sundaynewspaper gave the Christian Democrats 35.5 percent, the SocialDemocrats 39.3 percent, the Free Democrats 8.4 and the Greens 11.1percent.   That poll, which also ended Feb. 18, was conducted by theAllensbach Institute and involved 1,000 voters questioned over 14days, the newspaper said. It gave no margin of error.   Kohl's party has been slipping in polls for months. Institutedirector Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann told the Sunday newspaper thatKohl's coalition lacked unity and had not explained well enough theneed for unpopular reforms that make health care more expensive.   Der Spiegel's poll gave the far-right Republicans 3 percent,while the Bild am Sontag survey predicted they would get 4.7 percent.   The Republicans garnered 7.5 percent of votes in Jan. 29elections that won them their first seats in West Berlin's locallegislature. Under West Germany's election laws, the Republicanswill automatically send two deputies to the federal parliament afterthe 1990 elections.   Kohl's party lost its governing majority in West Berlin and theSocial Democrats are holding talks with the leftist AlternativeList, similar to the Greens, on a coalition city government.   Kohl on Saturday warned the Social Democrats against a coalitionwith what he called a ``radical group that stands in aleftist-socialist and anarchist gray zone.''</TEXT></DOC>
