The three ``Baby Bell'' regional phone companies assignedmanagers to replace strikers, but as call volume increased at thestart of the business day the impact of the strike was clearlyevident to consumers needing operator assistance.   ``I'm sorry, due to a work stoppage we are unable to provide younormal directory assistance,'' said a recorded message that greetedcallers seeking information in New York from NYNEX Corp., one ofthe companies hit by strikes Sunday. Similar recordings were beingused by the others, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis.   With no new negotiations scheduled, the walkouts threatened todisrupt service in many of the nation's major business hubs,including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburghand Washington, D.C.   Informal talks were expected today, and resumption of formalbargaining with all three companies hinged on those discussions.The strikes involve major differences between labor and managementover wages, health insurance and other benefits.   On strike were operators, technicians, sales, clerical, factoryand other workers at NYNEX, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis.Spared phone strikes were nine states in the Southeast served byBellSouth, which reached a tentative agreement with theCommunications Workers of America late Saturday.   Consumers dialing direct should notice little difference intheir service but those needing operator assistance faced somedelays, and spokesmen for the companies said repairs andinstallations also will be stalled as managers try to fill in forstrikers.   ``We have more than 20,000 management people filling in but wehave 60,000 strikers,'' said NYNEX spokesman Bob O'Brien. ``Butobviously there are fewer resources. Certainly (delays) willoccur.''   The unions, preparing for the possibility of lengthy strikes,this week will ask the AFL-CIO to adopt a support plan thatincludes a call on unions, their members and others who live in theaffected areas to withhold payment on their local phone bills.   The proposal will be presented to the 14-million-member laborfederation's executive council, which is holding its summer meetingthis week in Chicago.   Three more regional phone companies face Saturday strikedeadlines. Those companies, Ameritech, US West and SouthwesternBell, have 131,000 union workers and provide service in 24 states.   Of the strikes than began Sunday the situation at NYNEX appearedthe most contentious. Major disputes over wages and a companyproposal to shift health insurance costs to workers have preventedformal talks since Friday.   The company provides service in New York and the six New Englandstates. Like Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic, NYNEX has usedmanagement personnel to replace strikers.   NYNEX has 60,000 union workers, two-thirds of whom arerepresented by CWA. The International Brotherhood of ElectricalWorkers represents the remaining 20,000 and for the first time thisyear has bargained with its onetime rival union.   NYNEX was hit by a nine-day strike in 1986, the last time itbargained with the unions.   In all three strike situations, the unions and companiesremained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance,and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set ofnegotiations. The debate over health insurance has been the majorobstacle, with the unions resisting companies' efforts to shiftsome costs to workers.   Some progress was reported Sunday in talks between the twounions and Pacific Telesis, but the two sides sparred over thescope of the company's offer on the table when the strike wascalled at midnight Saturday.   Pacific Telesis serves parts of California and all of Nevada andemploys 44,500 union workers, all but 2,500 of them CWA members.   The strike deadline at Bell Atlantic was extended asnegotiations continued past midnight Saturday, but a walkout wascalled just before 7 a.m. Sunday because of a lack of progress.   Bell Atlantic serves Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey,Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.CWA represents 41,000 Bell Atlantic workers, IBEW 11,500.   Instead of posting pickets, the 64,000 union workers atBellSouth were preparing for a ratification vote on their newcontract.   The BellSouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent payincrease and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991, BellSouthofficials said. The pact also provides employees up to 12 months ofchild care leave and six months of medical coverage while on leave.</TEXT></DOC>
