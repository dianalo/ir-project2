Rigdon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>12/17/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><NS>MANAGEMENT ISSUES (MNT)</NS><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   Managers who have avoided being laid off may stillencounter Scrooge this season as pay increases and bonusesfor many of them shrink.   Consider Mary Ann LeBlanc. She will be spending 12 hoursdriving to visit her relatives for Christmas because GeneralMotors Corp. canceled the $600 bonus she was going to use forair fare. The tenant services manager says she's angry at herbosses and jealous of her hourly workers, who get to keeptheir bonuses under union contracts.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;One day we had people assuring us we were getting abonus, and the next day we got a memo saying we weren't,&quot; shesays. &quot;We're just supposed to be glad we have jobs.&quot;   Now when the office goes out for drinks, Ms. LeBlancexpects the hourly workers to pay. And, she jokes, &quot;they'dbetter be the ones bringing the Christmas buffet.&quot;   As the recession continues, an increasing number of middlemanagers are finding that bonuses are disappearing, promisedraises are fizzling, and performance reviews are being pushedback. GM's bonus cuts affected 100,000 North American middlemanagers. Last week, debt-ridden retailer R.H. Macy andamp; Co. cutout bonuses for more than 400 midlevel managers, although themoney will be added to salaries over a 12-month period. EvenMCA, the epitome of high-rolling Hollywood, has frozenmanagers' salaries.   &quot;Middle managers' pay has gone up the least ofeverybody's,&quot; says Jude Rich, chairman of Sibson andamp; Co., aPrinceton, N.J., consulting concern. In the past five years,top executives' cash pay rose 55.7%, compared with 48.8% formiddle managers, Sibson research shows.   And that's just the cash part of the package. Includinglong-term incentives such as restricted stock and performancebonuses, top executives' compensation has risen 71% since1986, compared with 50% for middle managers, Mr. Rich says.Many executives are earning performance bonuses even in thesetough times because &quot;frankly, they didn't set {theirperformance goals} too high,&quot; Mr. Rich says.   While statistics show that middle managers got annualraises of about 8% in recent years, most managers receivedonly half that, Mr. Rich says. The discrepancy is the resultof layoffs. Typically, laid-off managers have been lessproductive and received relatively small raises in recentyears. Once they are gone from the pool, the statistics aredistorted, Mr. Rich says.   Meanwhile, union workers have been chalking up slightlyhigher raises recently. In 1991, the average productionworker's wage rose 4.7%, while 1987 raises were only 1.8%,according to Sibson.   The pinch is most severe in finance industries. Servicecompany managers are used to 6% raises, says John England, acompensation consultant at Towers Perrin. &quot;This year it's notthat way anymore. This year there are zeros and pay freezes.It's a cold shower, a rude awakening.&quot;   Traditionally, industrial middle managers got larger payincreases than financial middle managers. The financialmanagers caught up in the mid-1980s, but &quot;they have againmoved behind,&quot; says Claudia Wyatt, a consultant for WyattCo., Boston. &quot;There's a lot of belt-tightening now becausecompanies are much less willing to pay for merit increases.&quot;   Of course, many middle managers are feeling lucky to havejobs. They have watched anxiously as giants such asInternational Business Machines Corp. and Citicorp have cutcosts by gutting middle ranks.   But the survivors are also growing bitter. They're told,&quot;Well, Joe, you're the winner,&quot; says Andrew Sherwood,chairman of the New York-based consulting concern Goodrich andamp;Sherwood. &quot;Of course you're going to have to do more work,and we can't give you a raise, and we're going to eliminatebonuses this year. And we're not real sure whether we have tocome back and cut deeper.&quot;   The cuts can go well beyond bonuses. Ford Motor Co.'sFirst Nationwide Bank unit, which cut out all bonuses lastyear, recently began stripping vice presidents of theirtitles as well as up to 20% of their pay, says a manager wholeft the company this year. The demotions, the former managersays, affected several of the bank's approximately 300 vicepresidents, who were asked to swap their offices for cubicleswithout telling colleagues what had happened. &quot;Several peoplegiven that option opted to quit,&quot; the departed manager says.   Robert Marcin, the bank's executive vice president forcorporate and employee relations, says he knows of no vicepresidents who have been demoted and that such demotionsaren't in the bank's plans. But he adds, &quot;I can'tcategorically say that has never happened.&quot; He speculatesthat some vice presidents who resigned may have thought theycould escape layoffs by volunteering for lower-payingpositions.   The bank's new method for distributing merit raises hitsmanagers harder than the rank and file. Last year, meritraises were automatic for all employees, Mr. Marcin says. Butthis year, just 80% of managers received the increases,compared with 85% of non-managers. Frustrated, the bank'smiddle managers are calling in sick and cashing in vacationdays, the former manager says.   GM managers, who have seen their departments shrink by asmuch as half after a wave of layoffs and early retirementprograms, are also displaying the effects of low morale. &quot;Idefinitely will take a shopping day now and let GM pay forit,&quot; says one manager. &quot;The next snowy day, we're not goingto run in here and bust our butts.&quot;   At Chemical Bank Corp., about 435 employees -- includingabout 250 middle managers -- were asked to sign agreements todelay windfalls of as much as $100,000 each that they were toreceive in January upon the completion of Chemical's mergerwith Manufacturers Hanover Corp.   Under a 1989 employment provision, Chemical employees hadthe right to immediately become fully vested in stock andother long-term incentives if the bank was merged orotherwise changed hands. By signing the new agreement,employees agree to become vested on the original, long-termschedule. A Chemical spokesman says most of the employeesaffected have agreed to sign. He declines to be morespecific.   &quot;That was one of the few carrots of the merger,&quot; saysDenise Johnson, a senior vice president who left the bank inSeptember. &quot;Stock has always been a big part of thecompensation plan for management.&quot;   The move has sown bad feelings, but top executives &quot;arewalking around saying everything's wonderful,&quot; Ms. Johnsonsays. &quot;There's more of a polarization within management now.&quot;   Top executives at some companies are trying to bolstermorale by taking hits along with their middle managers. AtExide Electronics Inc., for instance, top executives cuttheir own pay 8% to 10% in June, two months before announcingthat all salary review and wage adjustment dates would bepushed back by six months.   In October, after Exide reported a fiscal year-end loss of$6 million on revenue of $191 million, chief executiveofficer James Risher took a swipe at all top managers'compensation, including his own: He said the company wouldn'tbe paying its customary bonuses, which amount to 20% to 50%of base salaries.   The loss stung quality manager Brian Saylor, who hadplanned to sock part of his bonus -- 30% of his base salary-- into education funds for a daughter in college and twosons, aged 14 and 12.   &quot;Certainly I'm dissatisfied,&quot; Mr. Saylor says. But he addsthat the fact that Mr. Risher cut executive salaries first&quot;really cushioned the blow.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
