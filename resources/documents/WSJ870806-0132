President Aquino said in a letter read to the government's denationalization committee that she favors deferring further consideration of the sale of Philippine National Oil Co., or PNOC, &quot;in view of objections&quot; by the company's board, a member of the committee reported.    The member said the letter was &quot;a big disappointment for us&quot; but added that the committee intended to &quot;keep the issue alive&quot; by asking the president to specify her reasons for the delay.    President Aquino's decision followed criticism of the sale plan by PNOC's current board, which argued that denationalization might jeopardize Philippine control of an important resource. An earlier PNOC board had recommended the sale.    The plan involved selling shares in PNOC's refining and marketing units to Philippine and foreign private investors, with the government retaining a minority stake. Among the foreign investors expressing interest were British Petroleum Co. and Kuwait Petroleum Corp.    The denationalization committee, led by Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin, had hoped a successful PNOC sale would spark interest in other state-owned companies. PNOC is one of more than 100 state companies that the committee has recommended for denationalization.    In an effort to meet PNOC's concern, the committee plans to de-emphasize its original interest in finding a major foreign partner for the state oil company, the member said. </TEXT></DOC>
