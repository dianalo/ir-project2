The speech Khrushchev delivered three years after the death ofStalin, his predecessor, marked the formal break with Stalinism inthe Soviet Union. It was leaked to Western reporters in 1956.   The 400,000-circulation party weekly, Polityka, devoted fourfull pages to the speech in its July 30 edition, which went on saleto the public Wednesday. The paper also carried a half-pagecommentary by two of its journalists.   ``This is not the first time that it turns out that somethingthat is known to everybody must be said aloud sooner or later,''the Polish weekly said.   The publication comes as the Soviet Union, under MikhailGorbachev's leadership, carries out a campaign to discredit Stalinand shed light on dark pages of Soviet history. Polish leaderWojciech Jaruzelski and the Polish party have been strongsupporters of Gorbachev's moves toward ``glasnost,'' or openness.   Khrushchev's speech, delivered at a closed meeting at the 20thCongress of the Soviet Communist Party on Feb. 25, 1956, condemnedStalin's ``cult of personality.''   Khrushchev, who led the Soviet Union from 1958 to 1964, saidSoviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin warned that Stalin could be cruel.   The speech blamed Stalin, who came to power in 1941, forexecutions and deportations of people after show trials.   About 20 million Soviets were killed in political purges carriedout under Stalin and in the drive to collectivize agriculture,according to estimates by Western historians.      Polityka said that since 1956 it kept a copy numbered 2,094 of aPolish reprint of the speech, which had been brought back fromMoscow by Polish guests to the Soviet congress.   Leaders of the Polish United Workers Party, the country's rulingcommunist party, at the time authorized reprinting the secretspeech for internal party use.   ``Khrushchev did a great thing. But the leadership of the Polishparty has done a great thing also. The Polish text of the report isthe only official version until today,'' Polityka said.   A spokeswoman for Polityka said Wednesday that no editorsauthorized to comment on the publication were available.   A spokesman for the Censor's Office in Warsaw, who identifiedhimself only as Mr. Osiek, said he could only comment generallythat, ``Today the range of freedoms to publish various information... is so broad _ and getting broader day by day.''</TEXT></DOC>
