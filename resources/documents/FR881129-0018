As part of REA's continuing effort to codify its policiesand procedures, this new part and subpart are being proposed. In additionto codifying its policies and procedures, revisions are being proposedto the existing system that will coincide with the revision of the FederalCommunications Commission Uniform System of Accounts for TelecommunicationsCompanies as set forth in Part 32 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.Once the proposed rule is published final, REA Bulletin 461-1 will be rescinded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE</T2>: Public comments must be received by REA no later than January30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS</T2>: Submit written comments to Mr. William E.

This proposed action hasbeen reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation.The action will not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; (2) result in major increases in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets and, therefore, has been determined to be ``not major''. This actiondoes not fall within the scope of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. REA hasconcluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent a major Federalaction significantly affecting the quality of the human environment underthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432 et seq. 1976)and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or anenvironmental assessment. This regulation contains no information or recordkeeping requirement which requires approval under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C 3507 et seq.). The program listed in the Catalogof Federal Domestic Assistance that is impacted is 10.851_Rural TelephoneLoans and Loan Guarantees. For reasons set forth in the Final Rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, (50 FR 47035, November 14, 1985)this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 whichrequires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In order to facilitate the effective and economically operation of a businessenterprise, adequate and reliable financial records must be maintained.Accounting records must provide a clear and accurate picture of the enterprise'scurrent economic condition from which management can make informed decisionsin charting the company's future. A telecommunications carrier, becauseof the rate regulated environment in which it operates, possesses an evengreater need for financial information that is accurate, complete, andcomparable with that generated by other carriers. For this reason, theFederal Communications Commission (FCC) prescribes a Uniform System ofAccounts for the telecommunications industry.REA, in representing the federal government as mortgagee and in furtheringthe objectives of the Rural Electrification Act, has a special concernthat adequate records are maintained. Due to the cooperative organizationof many of our borrowers and the provisions included in REA's mortgageagreements and lien accommodations, REA has augmented the FCC Uniform Systemof Accounts with supplementary accounts that will provide the financialinformation necessary to operate a rural telecommunications enterprise.The current system prescribed in Parts 31 and 33 of the FCC Rules and Regulationswere developed at a time when a rigid institutionalized regulatory environmentwas expected to continue indefinitely. With the introduction of competitionand a variety of new products and services in the last decade, the existingsystems of accounts became inadequate to handle the needs of the telecommunicationscarrier. As a result, the FCC has adopted a revised Uniform System of Accountsas set forth in Part 32 of their Rules and Regulations. Effective January1, 1988, Part 32 shall be implemented in its entirety and the current systemsrescinded.This evolution has also necessitated a change in the accounting requirementsand supplemental accounts prescribed by REA. The provisions and requirementsdetailed in Part 1770, Subpart A, coincide with Part 32 and, if adopted,are to become effective with its implementation on January 1, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1770</ITAG>Accounting.In view of the above, REA hereby proposes to add a new part, Part 1770,Accounting, consisting of Subpart A, Accounting System Requirements, to7 CFR Chapter XVII to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1770_ACCOUNTING</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_Accounting System Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1770.10 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1770.11 Accounting system requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1770.12 Supplementary accounts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1770.13 Accounting requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1770.14 Continuing property records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1770.15 Supplementary accounts required of all borrowers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1770.16 Supplementary accounts required of nonprofit organizations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority</T4>: 7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Accounting System Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1770.10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>This subpart implements provisions of the standard REA loan documents withrespect to the accounting system to be maintained by telecommunicationsborrowers of the Rural Electrification Administration.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1770.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Accounting System Requirements.</ITAG>(a) Each REA borrower subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) or a State regulatory body shall maintain its accountsand records in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed bythat regulatory body.(b) Each REA borrower not subject to regulatory control as specified inandSection; 1770.11 (a) shall maintain its accounts and records in accordancewith the FCC Uniform System of Accounts as set forth in Part 32 of theCommission's Rules and Regulations.(1) REA borrowers having annual revenues derived from regulated telecommunicationsoperations of $100,000,000 or more shall maintain the accounts prescribedin Part 32 for Class A companies.(2) REA borrowers having annual revenues derived from regulated telecommunicationsoperations of less than $100,000,000 shall maintain the accounts prescribedin Part 32 for Class B companies.(3) REA borrowers maintaining the accounts prescribed for Class B companiesmay adopt the Class A accounts if they desire more detailed and sophisticatedaccounting records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1770.12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Supplementary Accounts.</ITAG>(a) All borrowers shall maintain the supplementary accounts set forth inandSection; 1770.15.
