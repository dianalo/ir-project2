SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Barbara Bush injected a bit of levity Wednesdayinto an exclusive U.N. luncheon for sometime-rivals Raisa Gorbachevand Nancy Reagan, putting the first ladies at ease in their finalofficial meeting.   ``It was very pleasant, very lovely, lots of smiling,'' said oneof the luncheon guests in attendance _ New York Post gossipcolumnist Aileen Mehle, better known as ``Suzy.''   Marcela Perez de Cuellar, the wife of the United Nationssecretary-general, hosted the lunch at her posh East Side home forthe first ladies, Mrs. Bush and 20 New York socialites, includingcosmetics manufacturer Estee Lauder.   ``I'm happy to be here in this city you call `The Big Apple,'''Mrs. Gorbachev told reporters, saying the words the big apple inEnglish. Aides to her husband, Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, had said he wanted to ``take a bite out of the BigApple'' during his three-day stay here.   As photographers urged the first ladies, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Perezde Cuellar to smile for pictures before lunch, Mrs. Gorbachev said,``We can't see you. That's why we don't smile.''   ``How do you say `cheese' in Russian?'' Mrs. Bush quipped as thefour women posed.   Mrs. Bush, using her wit and good humor, seemed intent ondefusing any problems at the gathering between the two first ladies,who have had their run-ins on previous occasions in the past threeyears.   As the translator interpreted the word ``cheese'' for Mrs.Gorbachev and Mrs. Bush, the group broke out in smiles and laughter.   The first ladies and the 20 women dined in an elegant room with amarble fireplace, crystal chandelier and tall windows overlookingthe East River. Each place was set with crystal bearing the U.N.insignia and at every place setting lay a small present wrapped in apeach bow.   A table seat plan showed Mrs. Perez de Cuellar had put Mrs.Gorbachev on her right and Mrs. Reagan on her left. Mrs. Bush wasseated next to Mrs. Gorbachev.   The two first ladies exchanged verbal invitations with Mrs.Gorbachev inviting the Reagans to the Soviet Union and Mrs. Reaganasking the Soviet first couple to visit them in California afterthey leave the White House in January.   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman, said that when Mrs.Reagan returned to Washington her husband told her that he, too, hadinvited the Gorbachevs to California.   ``They both said they'd like the Gorbachevs to see the West aswell as the East since they are totally different,'' Mrs. Crispensaid.   In the ``very animated conversation,'' Mrs. Gorbachev discussedher husband's efforts to open Soviet society with his policy ofglasnost and she added that they would like to see all nationsopened, according to Ms. Mehle.   Mrs. Reagan responded that the United States was ``indeed open,''but the two women did not argue the point, Ms. Mehle said.   After the lunch, Mrs. Reagan was asked how everything went as shedeparted in a limousine with Mrs. Bush. ``Fine, fine,'' she toldreporters.   Mrs. Gorbachev wore a navy suit with a thin banker's stripe. Mrs.Reagan wore a rust and brown suit with a silk scarf at her neck,while Mrs. Bush chose a purple plaid suit and what appeared to be agold medal on her shoulder with a U.S. seal.   Prior to lunch, Mrs. Bush surprised Christmas shoppers with astop at Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue.   ``We're not shopping,'' she called out with a smile as customersstopped to wish her well. Mrs. Bush made a quick stop at the storeto have her watch repaired, a store spokeswoman said.   Surrounded by Secret Service agents, Mrs. Bush spoke briefly withthose who stopped to congratulate her on her husband's electionvictory and signed an autograph for Joshua Steinberg, 9, of Brooklyn.   During her U.N. tour with Mrs. Perez de Cuellar, the Soviet firstlady had appeared to be somewhat tired.   While they posed for photographers at lunch, Mrs. Reagan told howMrs. Gorbachev had seemed immune to jet lag during an earlier tripto Washington. ``She never looks tired,'' Mrs. Reagan said.   ``We want your secret,'' demanded Mrs. Bush, evoking a round ofgiggles and smiles from the women.   The Soviet first lady's itinerary Wednesday also included a visitto the Estee Lauder cosmetic headquarters and an tour by car ofManhattan with her husband.   On Tuesday, Mrs. Reagan pooh-poohed reports that she and Mrs.Gorbachev had feuded in the past. She said she intended to wish theSoviet first lady _ an avowed Marxist-Leninist and atheist _ a merryChristmas.   Mrs. Gorbachev, during her U.N. tour, strolled with Mrs. Perez deCuellar through the modern glass and steel building, pausing to chatrepeatedly and look at many of its international artworks. She worea gray suit and aqua blouse.   Mrs. Perez de Cuellar, attired in a green and blackHarlequin-like suit ruffled at neck and cuff, explained several ofthe works that have been donated to the international organizationby member nations.   Mrs. Gorbachev noted that the Soviets intended to donate a bronzesculpture later in the day.   ``We like you,'' someone called out from the crowd, a comment metby smiles on the part of Mrs. Gorbachev.</TEXT></DOC>
