Petroleum resource development in China startedwith the 1st Phase 5-year Project in 1953, and then, large oil fieldssuch as Daging at Songliao Basin and Shengli at Bohai Basin were discoveredone after another. Since 1980, China has positively imported foreigncapital and technologies so that modern exploration, development andproduction have been improved, and become one of major oil exportingcountries. Now, northwest area in China is quite within the bonds ofpossibility that large resources will be found, as well as ocean areaat Bohai Basin in northeast area. It is assumed that 87 billion barrelsof oil will finally be exploited from all oil resources in China. Basedon this forecast, future oil supply capacity is estimated here.
