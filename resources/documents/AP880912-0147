The officials said the office has been investigated forinvolvement in two cases of illegal export of American militarytechnology, but they could not confirm a published report that theJustice Department and the FBI oppose the Israeli request becauseof law enforcement considerations.   According to the officials, who insisted on anonymity, majoritysentiment at the State Department appeared to be in support of theIsraeli request.   They said that members of an Egyptian military procurementoffice in Washington have been given diplomatic immunity. And theynoted that an Egyptian military officer who worked at the officewas arrested by U.S. authorities earlier this year in an allegedplot to smuggle missile components to Egypt.   The officer was freed after claiming diplomatic immunity and hassince returned to Egypt.   Israel is seeking a limited form of diplomatic immunity known asconsular immunity for the 47 Israelis in New York. This wouldprovide protection only for activities directly connected to aperson's official functions, not for all crimes.   But according to officials quoted in Monday's editions of TheWashington Post, this would be sufficient to shield from U.S.prosecution a foreign national suspected of involvement in theillegal export of U.S. military technology.   Responding to the Post story, Alon Liel, the Israeli ForeignMinistry spokesman in Jerusalem, said Israel has been trying for 18months to get diplomatic status for dozens of Israelirepresentatives of various ministries, including defense, economicsand tourism.   Liel said so far Washington has refused because these officialsare not working out of the Israeli Embassy in Washington.   ``We are not only speaking about the guys in the militarypurchasing office,'' Liel said. ``It also includes people from theministries of tourism and economics. These people have been sentover by the state of Israel, and they are not given full diplomaticstatus. It's a matter of principle.''   According to to Post, the Israeli request poses ``legal anddiplomatic'' problems about how the U.S. government should dealwith purchasing office employees suspected of seeking to smuggleAmerican military technology out of the country.   The Post said the FBI and the Justice Department are opposed tothe Israeli request.   The newspaper said the Justice Department in July 1986 sought toinvestigate eight Israelis in New York suspected of the illegalexport of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs. Thedepartment concluded last spring that it lacked sufficient evidencefor criminal prosecution.   Another case last November involved a Connecticut company thatpaid fines of $750,000 for violating U.S. export laws by smugglingequipment and technology to Israel for the manufacture ofchrome-plated cannon barrels. The Post said the exact role of theIsraeli purchasing office was never made clear.</TEXT></DOC>
