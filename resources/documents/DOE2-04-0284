In this process,the combustion products are transformed into a combination of gases andan aqueous condensate (water plus carbon dioxide). Realizing that ifsuch condensates contain carbonic acid they might have adverse effectsif discharged into building connections to sewers, research was conductedto: determine charactersitics of these condensates; determine typicalcondensate volume generated over the winter in a Toronto home; and tomeasure the corrosive effects of condensate, if any, on standard Portlandcement concrete and on asbestos cement piping. Two half pipes were mountedin the condensate outflow in order to simulate a sewer having a 2% slope.Measurements were made of condensate volume and pipe corrosion. Condensatevolumes were found to vary with hours of operation and were not of sufficientvolume to create any hydraulic overload conditions. Low sulfate levelswere observed, presumably reflecting the sulfur content of the naturalgas and the combustion air; such sulfate levels would not adversely affectconcrete. Acidity measurements showed condensates had a pH of around3, due to carbonic acid and mineral acidity. If not neutralized, suchcondensates are capable of seriously corroding concrete or asbestos cementpipes; in climates such as Toronto, failure of such pipes could occurwithin 5-10 years. Use of a neutralizer to adjust condensate pH is recommended.2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
