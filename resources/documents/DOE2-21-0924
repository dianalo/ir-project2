Different subpopulations in atumor may vary in cell kinetic behaviour and in sensitivity to variousantineoplastic treatment. The ultimate outcome of the treatment seemsto depend on how well the individual drugs in a combination, and theschedule in which they are given, match the sensitivity and cell kineticsof the subpopulations of each individual tumor. Flow cytometric DNA analysisis rapid and accurate. It yields information of G1-cell DNA content (DNAindex = DI) which can be used to discriminate and identify differentsubpopulations of cells and, it yields information of the fractions ofcells in the cell cycle phases, whereby treatment induced cell cycleperturbations can be studied. The analysis can be performed on solidtumors or cells in culture. If fine-needle aspirates of solid tumorsare used for analysis, several consecutive measurements can be obtainedfrom the same tumor. In this paper the authors review some of their dataobtained by flow cytometric DNA analysis in SCCL in patients, heterotransplantedto nude mice or in tissue culture. The data illustrate how, by the samemethod, heterogeneous tumors can be studied intact and complex, or brokendown in individual subpopulations grown with or without a host.</TEXT></DOC>
