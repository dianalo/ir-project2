(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bill Emerson went blind nine years ago,but has used computers, a guide dog and determination to keep hisjob as chief censor for KNBC-TV, where he reviews more than 8,000commercials and hundreds of shows and movies each year.   Emerson, 45, became the station's manager of broadcast standardsand practices in 1971, started losing his sight because of diabetesin 1976 and was completely blind by February 1979, he recalled.   The general manager of KNBC at the time offered him training andunion membership as an audio engineer, but Emerson declined theoffer.   ``I had this job for nine years before I went blind. I have agood memory and I am able to visualize quite well,'' he said in atelephone interview Tuesday. ``And most of the people have beenwith me a good number of years.''   His staff of three watches shows for him and reports anythingquestionable, and he can derive from the audio portion of a film ortape that something objectionable might be showing.   ``When I have a question I go to them,'' he said of the staff.``I ask them, `What does this look like?'   ``I probably am more aware of the audio track than others, so Ido catch some things that others don't,'' he said. In addition totape reviews, Emerson's wife reads scripts to him at home.   He learned Braille, but said reading raised dots with hisfingers is too slow-paced.   ``If I had to read a book in Braille, I would be asleep by thefourth page,'' he said. ``I listen to all my books on audio tape ondouble speed. You can train yourself to listen fast. And you gettwice the information in half the amount of time.''   Emerson also listens to double-speed playbacks of audio tapes ofshows, such as ``Family Feud.''   ``They sound like Donald Duck, but you can understand them,'' hesaid.   Emerson navigates the halls and offices at KNBC with the help ofhis yellow Labrador retriever Niles and a light-sensitive soundingdevice.   His workday also is made easier with help from a keyboardplugged into a computer that's equipped with a voice synthesizerand program to run it. The computer announces screeningappointments and keeps Emerson abreast of time schedules forcommercials and other matters.   The dog also gets to help in other ways.   ``I once did an editorial about nude beaches and we filmed it ata nude beach location with long-distance shots of nude bodies. Itwas nothing salacious or anything,' recalled former KNBC editorialdirector Jim Foy.   Emerson was responsible for reviewing the tape for broadcast,Foy said.   ``He had it reviewed, he said, by his dog. The dog said it wasall right, so we put it on the air _ and nobody complained. We didnot get one call on it,'' Foy said.</TEXT></DOC>
