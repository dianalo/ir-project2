While most of the survivalcurve analysis is conducted in terms of D0, Dq, and the mean inactivationdose D, some of the data are also discussed in terms of the linear-quadraticmodel parameter alpha. Using D it is shown that: (i) the radiosensitivityof human fibroblasts in exponential growth phase does not significantlydiffer from that of plateau-phase fibroblasts with immediate plating;(ii) the radiosensitivity of plateau-phase cells with delayed platingis correlated to the radiosensitivity of cells with immediate plating:the more radioresistant the cell strain in exponential growth phase,the higher its repair capacity; (iii) the repair capacity of the cellstrains is related to their genetic origin. In conclusion, we suggestthat the survival curve of growing cells depends on the repair capacityof the cells.</TEXT></DOC>
