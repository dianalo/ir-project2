Interested personswere provided 30 days to offer comments, suggestions, or recommendations.One set of comments from the Section of Public Contract Law, American BarAssociation, was received. The following summarizes those comments andaddresses them <T3>in seriatim. </T3><ITAG tagnum="84">A. General </ITAG>1. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter found the proposed regulations too detailedand technical in view of Congress' intent that they simply encompass thesafeguards afforded by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). For example,the commenter regarded the filing of post-hearing briefs as unnecessaryand wasteful. Believing that the proposed rules would make the proceedingstoo involved and costly, the commenter suggested that the Agency adoptgeneral guidelines and allow the parties to work out procedures for theirindividual cases. Alternatively, the Agency was urged to create two setsof procedures, one incorporating the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,and another less formal set. <T3>Response: </T3>The commenter is correct that Congress intended authoritiesalready bound by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to conform to itsrequirements in conducting hearings under the Program Fraud Civil RemediesAct (PFCRA, or the Act) and for authorities not so bound to issue regulationsunder the Act incorporating the APA requirements (31 U.S.C. 3803(g)). However,Congress required <T3>all </T3>authorities covered by the statute to promulgate rules andregulations implementing the Act (31 U.S.C. 3809), and Congress intendedsuch regulations to ``be substantially uniform throughout the government.''S. Rep. No. 99-212, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1985). Furthermore, Congressprovided that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) would send to each personfound liable under the Act a description of the procedures that would governthe proceeding (31 U.S.C. 3803(g)(3)(B)(i)). Congress clearly intended the affected agencies to develop comprehensiveprocedures for the conduct of hearings under PFCRA through notice and commentrulemaking. It did not envision that each agency would develop generalguidelines and leave procedures to be negotiated among the parties andthe ALJ in every particular case as suggested by the commenter. Nor isthere any indication that Congress intended the agencies to develop twosets of procedures_one for experienced litigants and another for the lesssophisticated. As the APA provides only general guidelines, which cover the broad rangeof agency adjudications, the implementing regulations make these requirementsspecific to proceedings under this Act. Moreover, the Act itself imposesa number of detailed procedural measures that go beyond those mandatedby the APA, such as provisions for prehearing discovery, the disclosureto the defendant of exculpatory information, limiting the venue of thehearing, internal review by a neutral reviewing official, and appeal ofan ALJ's initial decision to the authority head. The regulations must implementthese provisions, as well.First, we disagree with the commenter's premise_that a lack of specificityand detail would make proceedings more expeditious or less costly. To thecontrary, an agency's failure to anticipate problems and to establish mechanismsfor resolving them in regulations often leads to delays in litigation whilesolutions are created ad hoc. This delay may be not only costly to litigants,but may also be less fair than informing them in advance of the rules ofplay.We disagree that the procedures prescribed in these regulations are toodetailed or too technical. We believe that the proposed regulations andthose here adopted closely track the prescriptions of the statute and theprovisions of the APA, which are only augmented to the extent necessaryto fill in gaps left by the statute. For example, the regulations providea mechanism for the ALJ to enter a default judgment if a defendant failsto respond to the complaint within the time allowed by the statute, anevent not anticipated in the text of the Act.Finally, we think the regulation is sufficiently flexible to permit theALJ and parties to tailor the process to their needs and the circumstancesof each case. For example, prehearing conferences are optional with theparties and may be conducted by telephone (andSection;andSection; 42.19; 42.18(b)(13)).The parties may agree to submit the case for decision on a stipulated recordor on written statements (andSection; 42.19(c) (4) and (5)). Contrary tothe commenter's remark, post-hearing briefs are optional with the partiesunless required by the ALJ (andSection; 42.36), and if the ALJ should findthem unnecessary, the ALJ can dissuade the parties from submitting them.In sum, we believe that the regulation, which will be sent to all defendants,will give them a clear and comprehensive roadmap of all the procedures.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Specific</ITAG>1. <T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed regulation expands the term ``benefit''to include anything of value; whereas, Congress used the term as a subsetof ``money.''<T3>Response:</T3> The statute uses the term ``benefit'' or ``benefits''in three different places_in the definition of ``claim,'' in the definitionof ``statement,'' and in section 3803(c)(2)(C), where it is defined narrowlyto refer to benefits to individuals under specific governmental assistanceprograms. Only in the definition of ``claim'' is the term referred to parentheticallyas a subclass of ``money.'' No such limitation applies when ``benefits''is used in the definition of ``statement.'' In that context, we believethe term as defined in the regulation suits the remedial purposes of thestatute.The Agency dispenses things of value other than money, property, or services_suchas loan guarantees and employment. We believe that by providing a remedyagainst false statements, as well as against false claims, Congress intendedthe Act to cover material false statements in obtaining these items ofvalue, as well. To make our intention clear, we have amended the definitionof ``benefit'' in andSection; 42.2 to restrict it to application within thecontext of ``statement.''2. <T3>Comment:</T3> The commenter found the proposed definition of ``reviewingofficial'' deficient by asserting that it permits redelegation of authorityto a designee of the General Counsel, allegedly in violation of section3801(a)(8) of the Act requiring the authority head to designate the reviewingofficial. Moreover, it omits the statutory requirement that the reviewingofficial be serving in a position for which the rate of basic pay is notless than that for grade GS-16.<T3>Response:</T3> We disagree with commenter's reading of the statute.It neither explicitly nor implicitly limits the reviewing official designatedby the authority head in the regulations from redelegating that authority.Contrast section 3801(a)(8) of the Act with section 3812, which expresslyprohibits the Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General designatedby the Attorney General from redelegating to others the duties assignedto them by the statute. Especially as the statute provides for the disqualificationof a particular reviewing official in a given case, the General Counselmust have the flexibility to reassign responsibility for reviewing sucha case to another reviewing official. Of course, as the commenter correctlynotes, whoever is designated as a reviewing official in a particular casemust serve in a position for which compensation is at grade GS-16 or above.This statutory limitation was inadvertently omitted from the proposed regulationsand has been inserted into the definition.3. <T3>Comment: </T3>The definition of ``statement'' was questioned becauseit appears to permit VA to impose civil penalties and assessments underthe Act on the basis of a false statement made to a State or intermediaryin a program administered by <T3>any </T3>agency of the United States. The commenter suggests the definitionbe clarified to state that VA's jurisdiction extends only to programs administeredby the Agency.  <T3>Response: </T3>The definition of ``statement'' is taken directly fromsection 3801(a)(9) of the Act. We believe that the commenter's concernthat VA's jurisdiction under the Act is made impermissibly broad is answeredwhen the definition of ``statement'' is read in conjunction with section3801(c)(2) of the Act, which provides that statements are considered <T3>made to the authority </T3>when they are made to an agent, fiscal intermediary,or other entity, including a State or political subdivision thereof, actingfor or on behalf of the authority. It is our view that a statement of claimmade to a State with respect to an Agency program is also made to the Agencyas well.  4. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter criticized andSection; 42.3(b)(2) of theproposed regulation for leaving open the possibility that the Agency willseek dual penalties, one based on a false statement and another based ona false certification accompanying it.  <T3>Response: </T3>The regulation at issue quotes verbatim section 3801(c)(1)of the Act. However, we agree with the commenter that Congress did notintend that an authority could impose penalties against both the falsestatement and the certification accompanying it, even though the languageof the statute and the proposed regulation appear to permit it, and haveaccordingly clarified the definition.  The statute and regulation broadly define ``statement'' as ``any representation,certification, affirmation, document, record, or accounting or bookkeepingentry made.'' (See section 3801(a)(9) of the Act; andSection; 42.2 of theregulations.) The statute then clarifies that definition by stating thateach written ``representation, certification or affirmation'' is a separatestatement (section 3801(c)(1) of the Act). Because the latter provisionis relevant primarily in calculating the number of civil penalties forwhich a defendant may be liable, we incorporated it into andSection; 42.3of the regulation, ``Basis for civil money penalties and assessments.'' The ambiguity arises from the fact that to be actionable under the statute,any of the types of statements defined in section 3801(a)(9) must eithercontain or be accompanied by an express certification or affirmation ofthe truthfulness and accuracy of the statement (section 3802(a)(2)(C) ofthe Act). We conclude that Congress intended that where a certificationindependently asserts a material fact, rather than affirming the truthof facts asserted elsewhere, such certification may be a statement forpurposes of section 3802(a)(2) of the Act. On the other hand, where a statementin the form of a representation or a bookkeeping entry, for example, is``accompanied'' by a certification as to the truthfulness and accuracyof the representation or entry, the certification is an integral elementin making actionable the underlying representation or bookkeeping entry.Hence, only a representation <T3>or </T3>an entry may be counted as a statement subject to liability,not <T3>both </T3>the representation and the accompanying certification.  5. <T3>Comment: </T3>There is no statutory basis for proposed andSection; 42.3(e),which would permit the Agency to hold each person found liable for makinga claim or statement in contravention of the statute liable for a civilpenalty.  <T3>Response: </T3>We disagree and have retained andSection; 42.3(e) as proposed.Congress stated in section 6102(b) of the Act that in addition to recompensingagencies for losses they have sustained as a result of false, fictitious,or fraudulent claims and statements, the statute would serve to deter themaking of such claims and statements. That deterrent purpose is clearlybetter served if each person found liable under the statute may be heldliable for a civil penalty without regard to contribution by others alsoliable for the claim or statement. As to the commenter's claim that thisproposal is without precendent, we note that this section follows the precedentset in the regulations implementing the first Civil Monetary PenaltiesAct enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 789-792 (1981), codified at 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(c)and andSection; 1320a-7a. <T3>See </T3>42 CFR 1003.102(c)(1) (1986). Congress used this statute asa model in devising the PFCRA. S. Rep. No. 99-212, 99th Cong., 1st Sess.3-4, 8-9 (1985).   6. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.4 of the proposed regulations should incorporatethe limitations on the investigating official's subpoena authority statedin section 3804(a) of the Act, <T3>viz., </T3>that a subpoena may be issued only for materials ``not otherwisereasonably available to the authority,'' and only for the purpose of conductingan investigation under the Act.<T3>Response</T3>: The statutory limitations are incorporated by reference.However, we disagree that the statute permits the investigation officialto issue subpoenas <T3>only </T3>for the purposes of an investigation under the Act. Section3804(a) of the Act states prefatorily, ``For the purposes of an investigationunder section 3803(a)(1) of this title, an investigating official is authorized''to issue a subpoena. Compare it with section 3804(b) of the Act, whichbegins, ``For the purposes of conducting a hearing under section 3803(f)of this title,'' in authorizing ALJs to issue subpoenas. At the outsetof an investigation into allegations of false claims or statements, aninvestigating official is not in a position to elect from among all remediesand sanctions available to the Government. Furthermore, an agency's authorityto compel the production of documents by subpoena has been given wide scopeby the courts if the subpoena serves a legitimate statutory purpose; theagency's inquiry need not be focused on the forecast of a probable outcome.<T3>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </T3>327 U.S. 186 (1946);<T3>United States v. Morton Salt Co.</T3>, 338 U.S. 632 (1950); <T3>United States v. Powell</T3>, 379 U.S. 48 (1964).7. <T3>Comment</T3>: By requiring the person producing subpoenaed documentsto make the certifications required by andSection; 42.4(a)(3), the proposedregulation purports to authorize the investigating official to compel testimony,which Congress considered and rejected.<T3>Response</T3>: While it is true that Congress ultimately declined togrant the investigating official testimonial subpoena authority, the certificationsrequired by andSection; 42.4(a)(3) of the proposed regulations are auxiliaryto the production of documents pursuant to a subpoena <T3>duces tecum</T3>. With some exceptions, a custodian of records canbe compelled, either in the administrative hearing or in a civil actionto enforce the subpoena, to identify and authenticate the documents producedor to claim that he or she does not have possession of the records sought.<T3>See Curcio v. United States</T3>, 354 U.S. 118 (1957); <T3>McPhaul v. United States</T3>, 364 U.S. 372 (1960); <T3>United States v. O'Henry's Film Works, Inc.</T3>, 598 F.2d 313 (2dCir. 1979); <T3>United States v. Austin-Bagley Corp.</T3>, 31 F.2d 229, 234 (2d Cir.1929). Hence, to ensure compliance with the subpoenas <T3>duces tecum </T3>short of resorting to an enforcement proceeding inFederal court in every instance, we have required custodians to attestto their compliance. Likewise, with respect to documents protected by privilege,the regulation provides for the assertion of such privileges in advanceof enforcement proceedings. We believe this will help expedite investigationsunder the Act and will result in fewer expensive trips to the Federal courthousesimply to ensure compliance with the terms of documentary subpoenas.8. <T3>Comment</T3>: Section 42.4(b) is contrary to section 3803(a)(1) ofthe Act. The statute states that the investigating official shall reportthe findings and conclusions of an investigation, while the proposed regulationrequires the investigating official to report such findings and conclusionsto the reviewing official only if he or she believes an action under thePFCFA to be warranted. <T3>Response</T3>: We disagree with the commenter. The language of thestatute is not mandatory in the context of section 3803(a)(1), which givesthe investigating official discretion to begin an investigation of allegationsof liability under PFCRA. By requiring the investigating official to reportthe findings and conclusions of his or her investigations to the reviewingofficial, Congress sought to ensure that a case considered meritoriousby the investigating official was subjected to ``independent prosecutorialreview'' by an official free from any possible ``prosecutorial bias.''S. Rep. No. 99-212, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1985). Congress cannot reasonablyhave intended a highly-paid investigating official to spend time writing,and a highly-paid reviewing official to spend time reviewing, investigationreports on cases that do not warrant further expenditure of the agency'senforcement resources.Moreover, the decision of the investigating official not to report to thereviewing official on a given case precludes further action under the statuteagainst the person whose claim or statement has been investigated. Thus,there is clearly no harm to his or her interests from the absence of arequirement for findings and conclusions in all cases. We therefore declineto adopt the commenter's reading of the statutory provision.9. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.4(c) conflicts with the investigating official'sresponsibility to report his or her findings and conclusions to the reviewingofficial: Only the Attorney General or a designated Assistant AttorneyGeneral can delay a proceeding under PFCRA because it may interfere witha criminal investigation.<T3>Response: </T3>We likewise reject the commenter's conclusion here.Section 3803(a)(1) of the Act itself explicitly states that the investigatingofficial's responsibility to report on PFCRA investigations ``does notmodify any responsibility of an investigating official to report violationsof criminal law to the Attorney General.'' Under the Inspector GeneralAct of 1978, the Inspector General, who is VA's investigating officialunder PFCRA, is obligated to report violations of Federal criminal lawexpeditiously to the Attorney General (5 U.S.C. App. andSection; 4(d)). Also,by law, the head of an agency has a similar reporting obligation (28 U.S.C.535(b)). Congress intended that the Inspector General ``would be requiredto contact the Justice Department directly, without clearing the referralswith the agency head, the General Counsel of the agency or any other individualin the agency.'' S. Rep. No. 95-1071, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 30 (1978).Clearly, conduct that could subject a person to liability under the PFCRAalso might subject the person to liability under a number of criminal statutes,such as 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, or 1341. Also, at a particular pointin an investigation, it may become clear that an agent of a corporationis personally liable under the PFCRA. However, the investigating officialmay believe that further investigation would show that the corporation,corporate officers, and perhaps the government contract officer are criminallyliable. Premature disclosure to the reviewing official of the agent's liabilityunder PFCRA might jeopardize that ongoing investigation.Sections 42.4 (c) and (d) of the regulations make it clear that the investigatingofficial is not obliged to report to the reviewing officer under section3803(a)(1) just because he or she has evidence that a person's conductmay fall within the scope of the PFCRA. As a highly-placed government official,the Inspector General is expected to exercise discretion to balance thecompeting interests at stake in determining if and when to report findingsto the reviewing official.That the Attorney General or Assistant Attorney General has authority tocause a stay of a hearing under the Act, as provided in section 3803(b)(3),does not imply that the investigating official <T3>lacks </T3>the authority to prevent interference with similar interests<T3>before </T3>such a hearing has been commenced. Moreover, the intentof the Act is to convey additional flexibility to agencies, not to restrainthem in cases where they are victims of a false claim or statement.10. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.5(c)(6) does not satisfy the statutory requirementthat the reviewing official determine that there is a reasonable prospectof collecting from the defendant the amount for which the person may beliable.<T3>Response: </T3>We have concluded that the sufficiency of the basisfor the reviewing official's statement concerning the financial conditionof possible defendants is a matter best left to VA and the Department ofJustice. Hence, without agreeing with the commenter's position, we havedeleted the final sentence in andSection; 42.5(c)(6).Section 3809(2) of the Act directs the authority to promulgate regulationsrequiring the reviewing official to include in his or her notice to theAttorney General a statement that there is a reasonable prospect of collectingthe amount for which the person may be held liable. Congress thus soughtto ensure that in each case the authority and the Department of Justicewould weigh the benefits and costs of pursuing remedies under the Act orothers. The reviewing official's statement is obviously intended to assistthe authority and the Attorney General in determining how best to deploytheir limited enforcement resources, not to confer a right upon potentialdefendants. This intent is underscored by the fact that a defendant cannotobtain the reviewing official's notice to the Attorney General (section3803(g)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act). Also, Congress included the requirementthat the reviewing official make such a statement in section 3809(2) ratherthan list it among the criteria related to the merits of a proposed action,which it specified in section 3803(a)(2) of the Act.Congress recognized that obtaining financial information is a difficultand uncertain process. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 168lb,the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, 12 U.S.C. 3401-3422, and theTax Reform Act of 1976, 26 U.S.C. 6103, for example, limit or prohibiteasy access to the kinds of records which typically would illuminate thefinancial circumstances of a potential defendant. Consequently, judgmentsabout collectability are particularly difficult to make, especially beforeformal proceedings have been commenced.Under the circumstances, we believe that andSection; 42.5(b)(6) as currentlyworded satisfies the statutory requirement and properly leaves for theauthority and the Department of Justice the determination as to what willconstitute sufficient support for the reviewing official's statement.11. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter suggests that the regulation appears tocircumvent the $150,000 jurisdictional ceiling on agency adjudicationsunder PFCRA by defining ``related'' claims under section 3803(c)(1) ofthe Act too narrowly.<T3>Response: </T3>Congress provided in section 3803(c)(1) of the Act thatno allegations of liability could be referred to an ALJ if the reviewingofficial determines that an amount of money, or property or services witha value, of more than $150,000 was requested or demanded in a claim or``in a group of related claims which are submitted at the time such claimis submitted.'' By imposing the cap, Congress sought to ensure that a groupof related false claims submitted together that could result in hundredsof thousands or millions of dollars in penalties should be prosecuted jointlyin court, not separately in an administrative proceeding. S. Rep. No. 99-212,99th Cong., 1st Sess. 24-25 (1985).Claims must satisfy two statutory requirements if they are to be aggregatedfor purposes of computing the jurisdictional amount: they must be ``related,''and they must be ``submitted at the same time.'' Claims submitted at thesame time must also be ``related.'' That is, the mere fact that a contractorchooses to ``batch'' claims under several contracts together for submissionto the agency does not make them ``related.'' Also, claims aggregatingmore than $150,000, but submitted at different times, would not be overthe statutory maximum even though they might be related.Congress gave little clue as to what it meant by ``related,'' but it didremark that claims for progress payments under the <T3>same </T3>contract would be related. S. Rep. No. 99-212, 99th Cong.,1st Sess. 25 (1985). Section 42.6(b) of the regulations thus defines ``arelated group of claims submitted at the same time'' as ``claims arisingfrom the same transaction (<T3>e.g., </T3>grant, loan, application, or contract) that are submittedsimultaneously as part of a single request, demand, or submission.'' Thisdefinition is both reasonable and fully consistent with the language ofthe statute and the intent of Congress.12. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter took exception to the incorporation ofRule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure into andSection; 42.8 ofthe proposed regulation, noting that section 3803(d)(1) specifies thatservice of a complaint must be by registered or certified mail or by delivery.<T3>Response: </T3>The regulation implements the statute by providing thatif the complaint is delivered, delivery of the complaint may be made aspermitted under Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.13. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.9 of the proposed regulation is inconsistentwith the statute, in that the former would require a defendant to requesta hearing within 30 days of service, whereas the statute measures the 30days from receipt.<T3>Response: </T3>We have modified andSection; 42.8(b) to clarify that serviceunder andSection; 42.8 is complete upon receipt, either through the mail,as evidenced by an acknowledged return receipt card or by delivery as attestedto by the person who made delivery or who received the complaint. Section42.9(a), by allowing the defendant 30 days from service (receipt) to requesta hearing, is fully consonant with section 3803(d)(2) of the Act.14. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter does not believe that the statute permitsthe Agency to require an answer and recommended deleting andSection; 42.9.<T3>Response: </T3>We disagree. The statute provides that a person receivinga notice of allegations of liability (section 3803(d)(1) of the Act) mayget a hearing before an ALJ if such person requests a hearing within 30days of receipt. Congress conceived of the notice of allegations of liabilityas a ``complaint'' (S. Rep. No. 99-212, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 14 (1985)),and we have adopted that concept in these regulations (<T3>See </T3>andSection;andSection; 42.7 and 42.8). Consistent with that approach,we have denominated a defendant's request for a hearing as an ``answer''and have specified that the defendant shall admit or deny the allegationsin the complaint and shall state any defenses on which the defendant intendsto rely. This requirement will expedite the proceeding by focusing theissues for the parties and the ALJ, as well as giving the ALJ importantinformation about the complexity of the case that will be helpful to theALJ in scheduling a hearing, as the ALJ is required to do by statute andandSection; 42.12 upon receiving the answer.To the objection that the defendant has only 30 days to respond, it shouldbe noted that persons are required to answer a summons and complaint within20 days under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a). However, we have amended the regulationto provide that a defendant may file within 30 days of receipt of the complainta request for hearing and a request for an additional 30 days to file acomplete answer in accordance with andSection; 42.9. Cf. 42 CFR 1003.109(b)(1986).15. <T3>Comment: </T3>It is recommended that we delete andSection; 42.10 of theproposed regulation allowing for the entry of an order of default uponfailure to answer because the statute does not expressly provide for it.<T3>Response: </T3>Although the statute does not expressly provide fordefault upon a defendant's failure to request a hearing, this regulationis necessary to implement the Act. <T3>See </T3>section 3809 of the Act. Were there no such provision, a defendant'sfailure or refusal to answer the complaint alone would in itself preventagencies from exercising powers Congress intended agencies to have forthe administrative adjudication of false claims and statements (Pub. L.99-509, Sec. 6102(b)).16. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter challenged proposed andSection; 42.18(c)as an unauthorized limitation on an ALJ's inherent powers.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 42.18(c) has been revised slightly to statethat ``the ALJ does not have the authority to find Federal statutes orregulations invalid.'' This proposition follows from the fact that administrativeagencies themselves have no jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutionalityof legislative or administrative action. <T3>See, </T3>e.g., <T3>Motor and Equipment Manufacturer's Ass'n., Inc. v. EPA, </T3>627 F.2d1095, 1114-15 (D.C. Cir. 1979), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>446 U.S. 952 (1980); <T3>Spiegel v. FTC, </T3>540 F.2d 287, 294 (7th Cir. 1976); <T3>Finnerty v. Cowen, </T3>508 F.2d 979, 982 (2d Cir. 1974). <T3>See also Buckeye Industries, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, </T3>587 F.2d231, <T3>reh'g denied, </T3>591 F.2d 1343 (5th Cir. 1979) (``No administrativetribunal of the United States has the authority to declare unconstitutionalthe Act it is called upon to administer.''). <T3>Cf. Public Utilities Commission v. United States, </T3>355 U.S. 534,539-40 (1958). The ALJ making an initial decision on behalf of the authorityhead obviously has no greater authority than the authority head to declareFederal statutes and regulations invalid, and the regulation simply articulatesthat principle.Moreover, ``[o]n matters of law and policy,'' the ALJ is ``entirely subjectto the agency.'' <T3>Association of Administrative Law Judges v. Heckler, </T3>594 F. Supp.1132, 1141 (D.D.C. 1984). <T3>See also </T3>Scalia, <T3>The ALJ Fiasco_A Reprise, </T3>47 U. Chi. L. Rev. 57, 62 (1980). Asthe agency is given rulemaking authority under 5 U.S.C. 553 and many substantivestatutes, the ALJ is powerless to usurp that authority by declaring dulypromulgated regulations invalid. The ALJ's role is interpretation not legislation.17. <T3>Comment: </T3>The Agency is obligated to disclose to the defendantany exculpatory evidence contained in the reviewing official's report tothe Attorney General, contrary to proposed andSection; 42.20(c).<T3>Response: </T3>Section 3803(g)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act directly prohibitsthe disclosure of the reviewing official's report, and andSection; 42.20(c)implements that provision. However, the reviewing official is to includeexculpatory circumstances in his or her report to the Attorney General(andSection; 42.5(b)(5)), and the Agency is obligated to disclose exculpatoryinformation in the possession of the investigating or reviewing official.Hence, the information that goes into the notice may be disclosed to thedefendant although the notice itself is not disclosed.18. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.31 of the proposed regulations would createa presumption that the maximum amount of the penalties and assessmentsshould be imposed. The commenter noted that the statute vested broad discretionin the ALJ to determine the appropriate amount of penalties and assessmentsand recommended that the last sentence of proposed andSection; 42.31 be deletedas inappropriate.<T3>Response: </T3>The commenter is correct in noting that the ALJ andthe authority head on appeal have broad discretion under the statute infixing the amount of penalties and assessments. Without agreeing that thelast sentence of andSection; 42.31 is inappropriate, we have deleted it.19. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.32 of the proposed regulation fails to createa presumption that the hearing would be held where the defendent resides.<T3>Response: </T3>The proposed regulation tracks the statute. Section3803(g)(4) of the Act specifies three alternative sites for the hearing:(1) Where the defendant resides or transacts business; (2) where the claimor statement was made; or (3) in some place agreed upon by the defendantand the ALJ. It does not create a presumptive venue, nor should it. Thatdetermination is best left to the ALJ and the parties framing the case.20.<T3> Comment:</T3> Considering the gravity of allegations of false claimsor statements and the amounts at stake, evidence generally should be limitedto what is admissible in court. In particular, andSection; 42.34 should berevised to exclude hearsay evidence or at least to create a presumptionagainst the admission of hearsay.<T3>Response:</T3> We decline to accept the commenter's suggestions. First,it is well-established that technical rules of evidence_such as the FederalRules of Evidence_do not apply in an administrative proceeding absent aregulation expressly making them applicable.<T3> See</T3> 5 U.S.C. 556(d);<T3> Richardson v. Perales,</T3> 402 U.S. 389 (1971). That Congress choseto provide for the adjudication of allegations of false claims and statementsagainst the Government in an administrative forum under the APA stronglysuggests that Congress also intended the less restrictive evidentiary standardsof the APA to apply. The very advantages of expediency and lower cost thatCongress sought by providing this administrative remedy would be lost ifthe Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedurewere imported into it from the judicial context. Moreover, the reasonsfor the more rigorous exclusionary rules of the Federal Rules of Evidence,such as those against hearsay, do not obtain where no jury can be misled.<T3> See,</T3> e.g., 3 K.C. Davis,<T3> Administrative Law Treatise,</T3> andSection; 16.4 (2d ed. 1980);<T3> An Approach to Rules of Evidence for Nonjury Cases,</T3> 50 A.B.A.J.723 (1964); Davis,<T3> Hearsay in Administrative Proceedings,</T3> 32 Geo. Wash. L. Rev.689 (1964); Gellhorn,<T3> Rules of Evidence and Official Notice in Formal Administrative Hearings,</T3>1971 Duke L.J. 1.Instead, the provisions of andSection;andSection; 42.34 (a) through (d) arebased on Recommendation 86-2 of the Administrative Conference of the UnitedStates, 1 CFR 305.86-2, published at 51 FR 25642 (July 16, 1986). Theyprovide that an ALJ shall exclude evidence that is irrelevant and immaterialand may exclude relevant evidence that is unreliable or if its probativevalue is substantially outweighed by other factors, such as an unfair prejudiceor the undue consumption of time.With respect to a defendant's right to confront adverse witnesses, andSection;42.33(b) provides that an ALJ may permit testimony to be admitted in theform of a written statement or deposition. If the ALJ chooses to allowsuch testimony, the party seeking to introduce it must provide it to allother parties with the declarant's last known address in a manner whichaffords other parties sufficient time to subpoena the witness for cross-examinationat the hearing. This satisfies due process.<T3> Richardson V. Perales, supra.</T3>21.<T3> Comment:</T3> The commenter objects that andSection; 42.38 of the proposedregulations conflicts with section 3803(i)(1) of the Act, which providesthat the decision of an ALJ is final unless it is appealed by the defendant.<T3>Response:</T3> We do not believe that andSection; 42.38 conflicts withthe statute. By providing for reconsideration of the initial decision,the regulation allows for the expeditious resolution of errors of law andfact by the trier of fact, who can most expeditiously resolve these matters,perhaps without resort to an appeal to the authority head.An ALJ's decision becomes the final decision of the Agency unless it isappealed within 30 days by a person determined to be liable for penaltiesand assessments. This is a departure from adjudications under the APA.Under 5 U.S.C. 557(b), an ALJ makes an initial or recommended decision,while the agency retains full authority to make a<T3> de novo</T3> determination as to issues of law and fact on the recordeither on appeal or by review on its own motion. The agency thus can ensureconsistency in its decisions and adherence to agency policy_including uniforminterpretations of the statutes it administers and its own regulations.Moreover, where novel issues of law arise in the context of adjudications,the agency may articulate its policy in the first instance, subject, ofcourse, to judicial review.It is difficult to conceive that Congress intended to eliminate the authority'sprerogative of speaking the final word on statutes and regulations withinits purview. Without a process of reconsideration, the agency would bepowerless even to seek, let alone make, corrections of misstatements oflaw and fact in ALJ decisions unless a defendant were found liable andchose to appeal. We do not believe Congress intended to sacrifice uniformityand consistency in decisions under this Act and other substantive statutesthat will be subject to interpretation in adjudications thereunder. Hence,we have provided an opportunity for both parties to seek reconsiderationof the ALJ's initial decision as necessary for the effective implementationof this statute.22.<T3> Comment:</T3> The commenter argued that andSection; 42.39 of the proposedregulation eliminated for 25 days a defendant's right to appeal to theauthority head, as provided in section 3803(i)(2)(A) of the Act. The commenteralso took exception to the requirement that the defendant must file a legalbrief on appeal specifying exceptions, stating that a brief letter oughtto suffice in some cases.<T3>Response: </T3>With regard to the first comment, we have amended andSection;42.39(b) to provide that a defendant may file a notice of appeal at anytime within 30 days after the ALJ issues a decision, but that if anotherparty files a request for reconsideration in accordance with andSection;42.38, action on the appeal will be stayed automatically pending dispositionof the motion for reconsideration.With regard to the second concern, insofar as Congress provided that anALJ's decision would stand as the authority's own, absent an appeal bythe defendant, Congress clearly did not intend for the authority to routthrough the decision in search of error or to redetermine all issues <T3>de novo </T3>without any guidance from the aggrieved party. The Agency'sdiscretion to limit its consideration on appeal to specific exceptionspointing out error is both well-established and of obvious practical value.<T3>See Marshall Field andamp; Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, </T3>318U.S. 253, 255 (1943); <T3>National Labor Relations Board v. Cheney California Lumber Co., </T3>327U.S. 385, 387-88 (1946). The Attorney General's Committee on AdministrativeProcedure long ago urged agencies to insist upon ``meaningful content andexactness in [an] appeal from the [ALJ's] decision * * *'' and to ceasefrom shouldering ``the burden of complete reexamination. Review of the[ALJ's] decision should in general and in the absence of clear error belimited to grounds specified in the appeal.'' <T3>Administrative Procedure in Government Agencies, </T3>S. Doc. No. 8,77th Cong., 1st Sess. 52 (1941) (Final Report of the Attorney General'sCommittee on Administrative Procedure). We agree.23. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.43 should be revised to reflect the fact thatinvestigating and reviewing officials may not make collections under section3806 of the Act, as provided in section 3809(1) of the Act.<T3>Response: </T3>This limitation is already contained in andSection; 42.14,pertaining to separation of functions.24. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 42.44 should be revised to indicate that onlya final decision imposing penalties or assessments may constitute the basisfor an administrative offset under section 3807 of the Act.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 42.44 of the regulation reiterates the statutorylanguage. A final decision is defined in andSection;andSection; 42.10 (d) and(l), 41.37(d), 42.38(g), and 42.39(l).In addition to the comments from the American Bar Association Section,the Departments of Health and Human Services and Education received commentson their proposed regulations on the definition of ``Person'' (<T3>i.e. </T3>those liable for violations under the Act). The commenterchallenged the inclusion of States and their political subdivisions inthat definition. We agree with the commenter and have amended our regulationsto exclude States and their political subdivisions from the definitionin andSection; 42.2, thus reiterating the definition in section 3801(a)(6)of the Act.In addition, a number of minor, technical changes to the proposed regulationswere made pursuant to comments received from within the Agency. Based oninternal comments, andSection; 42.1(b) was amended to clarify that the onlyadministrative procedures and actions for imposing penalties and assessmentsfor violations of the PFCRA are contained in the proposed new Part 42 toTitle 38, Code of Federal Regulations. Section 42.3(c) is also amendedto clarify that the exemption from liability for violations of the Actto certain persons receiving specified VA benefits does not extend to afiduciary for the beneficiary.The final regulations address the requirements of the Program Fraud CivilRemedies Act, Pub. L. 99-509, sections 6101-6104, 100 Stat. 1874. Basically,this law permits agencies to bring administrative proceedings against personswho knowingly make, present, or submit a false claim or statement againstthe agency. From the false claimant, an agency may recover up to twicethe amount falsely claimed and impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 foreach separate false statement. Any penalty or assessment may be collectedby the Attorney General through the filing of a civil action, or by offsettingfrom the penalty or assessment amounts, other than tax refunds, owed theparticular party by the Government, including VA benefits. All recoverieswould be deposited in the United States Treasury.These final regulations are based on model regulations drafted by a committeecomposed of representatives of nine major agencies and chaired by the Departmentof Health and Human Services at the request of the President's Councilon Integrity and Efficiency. The chairman of the Council urged that allagencies required to promulgate regulations adopt the model regulations.(VA employed the model regulations in drafting its version to be containedin 38 CFR Part 42.)In accord with the Act's requirements, these final regulations prescribethe following procedures for VA when it receives allegations of a falseclaim:(a) Investigation by the VA Inspector General, who will report the findingsand conclusions to the reviewing official if an action under the Act maybe warranted;(b) Review of the investigation by a reviewing official from the Officeof the VA General Counsel to determine whether the evidence supports abelief of potential liability;(c) Referral by the reviewing official to the Department of Justice. Ifthe Attorney General approves, the reviewing official will notify the personof the allegations and of the right to a hearing. The reviewing officialcan compromise or settle any case up until the time a decision is renderedby a hearing examiner;(d) A hearing, if requested, administered by an examiner who is an AdministrativeLaw Judge (ALJ), with all the due process protections under the AdministrativeProcedure Act. The ALJ would also determine liability and the amount ofthe penalty and assessment; (e) If found liable, an appeal to the Agency head and then the United StatesDistrict Court. While the Act generally permits VA to take action against anyone who makesa false claim or statement to the Agency, such as contractors, employees,veterans' guardians, loan appraisers, and private insurers and hospitals,the remedies under this law may <T3>not</T3> be asserted for overpayment frauds against individual recipientsof specified benefits, such as VA pension, compensation, or health-carebenefits. But, actions could still be brought against individuals for fraudinvolving their <T3>basic</T3> eligibility to receive these benefits. The Administrator hereby certifies that the final regulations will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612.Based on investigations and other past experience, VA anticipates thatless than a significant number of false claims or statements, as definedin these regulations, would be submitted or made to the Agency by smallentities. In addition, these regulations simply address administrativeproceedings to be used by VA in complying with the requirements of theProgram Fraud Civil Remedies Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulationsare therefore exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibilityanalyses requirements of sections 603 and 604. These final regulations have also been reviewed under E.O. 12291, FederalRegulation, and have been determined to be non-major because they wouldnot increase costs to consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,and local government agencies or geographic regions.
