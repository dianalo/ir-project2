Despite this, real estate and home building organizations aredetermined not to let the million dollar ``cap'' be reduced by asingle dollar, defending their stand as being in the interest ofmiddle-class homeowners.   Taking a ``stand'' doesn't begin to suggest their determination.Leaders of housing-related industries sound these days likemilitary commanders determined to give no ground. They have made uptheir minds, they have drawn the line. It is $1 million.   For Congress to tamper with deductibility, says Kent Colton,executive vice president of the National Association of HomeBuilders, would be to risk a taxpayer rebellion. He says it could``strike at the heart of middle America.''   Ira Gribin, president of the National Association of Realtors,is equally concerned. ``Guarding against threats to homeownershipand private property rights in general is similar to manning a firestation,'' he said recently. ``You have to be on duty all the time,not just when there's a fire.''   Few issues have ever fired up the two industries to such anextent. Nearly 20,000 Realtors have sent letters to President Bushseeking his help against the threat. It has been made a plank inthe Home Builders Statement of Policy.   Many people think the alert is overdone, that the vigilance isuncalled for. If there is a threat, they say, it is hardly avisible one.   Even before his election, the president endorsed the taxdeduction as it now stands and has given no indication of changinghis mind. And Senate and House members have given their assurancesthat no changes are likely.   The Realtors say the office of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex,chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has said the subject isoff the table, or not up for reconsideration.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways andMeans Committee, has said in reference to the maximum, $1 milliondeductibility, ``As long as I'm chairman, it's going to remainwhere it is.''   As if that weren't assurance enough, more than 100representatives have endorsed a resolution ``that it is the senseof the Congress that the current law regarding the Federal incometax deduction for interest on debt secured by a first or secondhome should not be further restricted.''   So why worry? Because, say real estate and housing people, theincome tax deduction on home mortgage debt already has been limitedtwice in the past three years. It can happen again, they say,easily and quickly.   Says Gribin: ``Just as the best time to put out a fire is beforeit has a chance to really get started, the best time to defendagainst a potentially disastrous piece of legislation is before itgarners a lot of support.''   And Colton: ``The great concern is the foot in the door.'' Oncethe barrier is lowered, he says, it can be lowered more easily inthe future, again and again until deductibility is eliminatedaltogether.   He has other reasons too. Unless the allowable deduction is cutto a small fraction of the existing $1 million limit, he says, therevenues produced would hardly be significant. He also contendsthat whatever revenues are generated would be offset by those lostthrough a decline in new-home construction.   ``As long as the decision is made in full view of the Americanpublic, the deductibility will be kept,'' he states. ``The troubleis that a lot of deals are made in closed rooms.'' He wants to wardoff that possibility.   Jeff Lubar, a Realtor spokesman, offers an even more succinctexplanation for having the troops on alert.   Congress must be watched, he suggests, because ``all it takes isa pen to scratch out one zero and $1 million goes to $100,000.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, April 7</NOTE><TEXT>   .</TEXT></DOC>
