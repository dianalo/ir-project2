Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">II. Discussion of the rule and comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">III. Procedural matters</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>A. General Purpose of the RuleSections 201(c) and 510(c) of the Surface Mining Control and ReclamationAct of 1977 (the Act or SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1211(c) and 1260(c), authorizea regulatory authority to withhold a surface coal mining and reclamationpermit from any applicant who either directly, indirectly or through arelationship of ownership or control is in violation of the Act or certainother environmental laws and regulations.The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) has implementedthese provisions of the Act by regulations at 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15.Also, under section 503(a)(7) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1253(a)(7), and regulationsat 30 CFR 730.5 and 732.15, each State regulatory program is required tohave regulations that are consistent with andSection;andSection; 773.5 and773.15. General procedures governing OSMRE enforcement of this State programrequirement appear at 30 CFR Part 843.Through administrative error, or otherwise, a regulatory authority in somecases may not make the connection between an applicant and an unabatedviolation or a delinquent penalty or fee in accordance with these provisions,and as a result may improvidently issue a permit. To provide correctivemeasures for bringing these permits into compliance, this rule adds toPart 773 general procedures governing improvidently issued permits andpermit suspension and rescission, and to Part 843 procedures for OSMREaction on improvidently issued State permits.This rule also revises the heading of existing andSection; 843.13 to furtherdifferentiate that section from the remainder of this rule.B. History of the Rule This rule initially was proposed by OSMRE on July 16, 1986 (51 FR 25822),along with other provisions in Part 773. The other provisions in andSection;andSection;773.15 (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(2) and a portion of andSection; 773.15(b)(3) werepromulgated in the October 3, 1988 (53 FR 38868) OSMRE final rule on ownershipand control (the ownership and control rule). The remainder of these otherprovisions will appear in a subsequent final rule. On September 24, 1986 (51 FR 33905), the comment period for the proposedrule was extended to October 24, 1986. On August 4, 1988 (53 FR 29343)OSMRE reopened the comment period and published a supplement to the proposedrule.

Public Comments No request was received for a public hearing on the proposed rules, andnone was held. Commenters on the proposed rules included environmental groups, trade associations,Federal and State agencies, the coal industry, and individuals. Eighteencomment letters were received on the initial proposed rule, and three onthe later proposed rule, some of which incorporated another of the lettersby reference. Comments were received both for and against the general regulatory schemeof the rule. The individual comments, along with OSMRE responses, are discussedin the following section of this preamble. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of the Rule and Comments </ITAG>A. General Overview This rule adds to the existing OSMRE regulations in 30 CFR Title VII newprocedures for dealing with improvidently issued surface coal mining andreclamation permits. It includes, in andSection; 773.20, general proceduresfor improvidently issued permits; in andSection; 773.21, procedures for rescindingan improvidently issued permit; and, in andSection; 843.21, procedures forOSMRE action on improvidently issued State permits. In addition, to further differentiate existing andSection; 843.13, whichgoverns the suspension and revocation of a permit for a pattern of violations,from new andSection; 773.20, this rule revises the heading of andSection; 843.13to read: ``Suspension or revocation of permits: Pattern of violations.''As noted in the preceding background section of this preamble, this rulederives primarily from the later proposed rule, published on August 4,1988 (53 FR 29343). A number of changes were made in the final rule inresponse to public comments, as discussed below. Without changing its generaleffect, the rule also was reworded in an attempt to eliminate ambiguity,and thus make it easier to understand and apply. Each section of the rule is discussed in detail under the following headings,along with the comments received on the corresponding sections of the initialand later proposed rules and the OSMRE responses. Several issues and relatedcomments that apply to more than one section of the rule are discussedunder the subsequent heading, <T3>F. Statutory Authority and General Comments, </T3>which covers thefollowing topics: (1) the statutory authority for the rule; (2) its relationshipto the OSMRE rule on ownership and control; and (3) the rule is not retroactive.B. Section 773.20 General Procedures for Improvidently Issued Permits <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview </ITAG>Section 773.20 contains the general procedures a regulatory authority mustemploy to determine whether a surface coal mining and reclamation permitwas improvidently issued and to implement remedial measures. Section 773.20(a)imposes general requirements; andSection; 773.20(b) lists the criteria aregulatory authority must apply in finding that a permit was improvidentlyissued; and andSection; 773.20(c) sets out four remedial measures, one ormore of which a regulatory authority must apply to an improvidently issuedpermit. Final andSection; 773.20 derives primarily from andSection; 773.20 of the laterproposed rule. The requirement of initial proposed andSection; 773.20(b)for a notice of violation (NOV) was deleted as unnecessary because theremedial measures in final andSection; 773.20(c) provide sufficient and moredirect mechanisms for achieving compliance. The permit rescission proceduresof initial proposed andSection; 773.20(b) were relocated in revised formin final andSection; 773.21 to emphasize that permit rescission is only oneof the four alternative measures a regulatory authority must choose betweento remedy an improvidently issued permit. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 773.20(a) Permit Review </ITAG>Section 773.20(a) contains general requirements for permit review and review-relatedcompliance. Under this section a regulatory authority which has reasonto believe that it improvidently issued a surface coal mining and reclamationpermit must review the circumstances under which the permit was issued,using the criteria in andSection; 773.20(b). If the regulatory authorityfinds that the permit was improvidently issued, the regulatory authoritymust comply with andSection; 773.20(c). This section derives from the introductory paragraph of proposed andSection;773.20(a), which was revised to clarify and set out in a separate paragraphthe procedural steps leading to a finding that a permit was improvidentlyissued. In this section, the term <T3>finds </T3>was substituted for the proposed term <T3>determines </T3>as more precise. The ``reason to believe'' standard in andSection; 773.20(a) for promptingaction by the regulatory authority is equivalent to the ``discovers'' standardset out in the preamble to the initial proposed rule, 51 FR 25826. It wasadopted to make the terminology of andSection; 773.20 parallel to that ofproposed andSection; 843.21, which applies a similar standard to State permits.Under this ``reason to believe'' standard the regulatory authority is notrequired to review all of the permits under its jurisdiction on a regularbasis for improvident issuance, but only a particular permit it has somereason to believe was improvidently issued. <ITAG tagnum="81">Application of Rule to Permit Revisions </ITAG>One commenter said that while a regulatory authority might properly consideran operator's past history, in the absence of new information it shouldnot use permit <T3>revision </T3>as a trigger to review whether a permit was improvidentlyissued. OSMRE agrees. The rule requires a regulatory authority to review the underlyingcircumstances only when it has reason to believe that a permit was improvidentlyissued, not as a matter of routine for every permit revision. The OSMRErequirements for permit revision appear at 30 CFR 774.13. <ITAG tagnum="81">Conditionally Issued Permits </ITAG>Several commenters said that to facilitate prompt rescission if the permitteefails to comply with a conditionally issued permit, the rule should requirethe regulatory authority to periodically review and update the informationwhich led to its conditional issuance.OSMRE did not adopt the commenters' suggestion. As explained in the subsequentdiscussion of andSection; 773.20(b)(1), this rule does not apply to permitsvalidly issued with conditions, but only to those issued contrary to theviolations review criteria of the applicable regulatory program, or issuedon the presumption that a notice of violation was in the process of beingcorrected to the satisfaction of the responsible agency, but a failure-to-abatecessation order (FTACO) subsequently was issued. For a permit that was <T3>conditionally </T3>issued, the regulatory authority has the same dutyto monitor compliance with its conditions as for compliance with any otherrequirement of the regulatory program, and has available the same enforcementmeasures. For a permit issued on the <T3>presumption </T3>that a specifically identified violation was beingcorrected, the regulatory authority has a duty to determine whether abatementin fact occurs, and if not to issue an FTACO which would lead to applicationof the remedial measures of this rule. This rule does not require either OSMRE or State regulatory authorities,however, to conduct general, ongoing, systematic reviews of permits undertheir jurisdiction for improvident issuance. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 773.20(b) Review Criteria </ITAG>Section 773.20(b) requires a regulatory authority to find that a surfacecoal mining and reclamation permit was improvidently issued if the permitmeets specified review criteria. These criteria, which derive primarilyfrom the later proposed rule, were modified somewhat in this final rulein response to public comment. Although not explicitly stated in the rule, OSMRE expects that the regulatoryauthority will make the required finding in writing as a basis for furtheraction on an improvidently issued permit. <ITAG tagnum="81">Additional Factors </ITAG>Several commenters said that later proposed andSection; 773.20 was a majordeparture from the initial proposal, as well as from the October 1, 1987,OSMRE Directive INE-34, ``Guidelines for Responding to Improvidently IssuedPermits.'' Under the later proposal, the commenter said, OSMRE sought toimpose additional factors to be considered by the regulatory authorityin what, heretofore, had been a straightforward exercise. The commenterconcluded that neither the Act nor its legislative history contemplatedthose additional factors, and that OSMRE had not offered the necessaryjustification for its change in policy. OSMRE disagrees that the initial and later proposed rules were in any waydeficient to support this final rule, or that the rule in any way is contraryto the Act or its legislative history. This preamble clearly articulatesthe basis and purpose of, and the legal authority for, the criteria inandSection; 773.20(b), and thus fully supports any change in policy or legalinterpretation the rule may embody. Following promulgation of this rule,OSMRE will consider the need to revise its internal directives to reflectany such change. a. <T3>Section 773.20(b)(1). </T3>The first criterion, in andSection; 773.20(b)(1),is that under the violations review criteria of the regulatory programat the time the permit was issued, either (i) because of an unabated violationor a delinquent penalty or fee the regulatory authority should not haveissued the permit; or (ii) the permit was issued on the presumption thata notice of violation was in the process of being corrected to the satisfactionof the agency with jurisdiction over the violation, but a failure-to-abatecessation order (FTACO) subsequently was issued. This section derives frominitial and later proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(1). Section 773.20(b)(1)(i) does not specify any particular unabated violation,delinquent penalty or fee, or ownership or control relationship as thebasis for a finding that a permit was improvidently issued. Instead, theregulatory authority is to apply whatever violations review criteria werein force in the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued. The rule does not require ``a demonstrated pattern of willful violations,''as specified in section 510(c) of the Act, for which separate proceduresexist in 30 CFR 843.13. Depending on the regulatory program under which a permit is reviewed, theapplicable violations review criteria under andSection; 773.20(b)(1)(i) ofthis rule may include such Federal regulations as those at 30 CFR 741.21(b)and 786.17(c) (1979) for the 1979 permanent program, or at 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)for the current permanent program, their State program equivalents, definitionsof ownership or control relationships, the Revised Parker Order, internalagency directives, and the like. In response to public comment, OSMRE has concluded that it is best to framethe rule in general terms, referencing the violations review criteria ofthe applicable regulatory program, and then have the regulatory authorityapply its specific violations review criteria on a case-by-case basis.This approach will best account for any differences that may exist betweenregulatory programs, and give each State regulatory program the statusintended by the Congress under primacy. It also will account for any changesthat may occur over time in a particular regulatory program. OSMRE expects that in applying this criterion of the rule, a regulatoryauthority will interpret its violations review criteria in the same wayas they lawfully were, or should have been, interpreted at the time ofpermit issuance. The presumption referred to in andSection; 773.20(b)(1)(ii) regarding a noticeof violation (NOV) is authorized by andSection; 773.15(b)(1) of the October3, 1988 (53 FR 38868) OSMRE final rule on ownership and control (the ownershipand control rule), which this preamble incorporates by reference. Underthis presumption,<ITAG tagnum="20">[i]n the absence of a failure-to-abate cessation order, the regulatoryauthority may presume that a notice of violation issued pursuant to andSection;843.12 of [30 CFR Chapter VII] or under a Federal or State program hasbeen or is being corrected to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdictionover the violation, except where evidence to the contrary is set forthin the permit application, or where the notice of violation is issued fornonpayment of abandoned mine reclamation fees or civil penalties.</ITAG><T3>Id</T3>. at 38890. Where a permit is issued on this presumption, butan FTACO subsequently is issued, the procedures of this rule apply.<ITAG tagnum="81">Violations Review Criteria </ITAG>Because this rule is written in general terms, and the violations reviewcriteria of each Federal or State regulatory program will govern the specificunabated violations, delinquent penalties and fees, and ownership and controlrelationships to which it will apply, it is appropriate to set out theviolations review criteria each regulatory program should include. The following list sets out these violations review criteria. It coversthe types of unabated violations and delinquent penalties and fees forwhich a regulatory authority should have withheld a permit, as well asthe applicable ownership and control relationships. Each item in the listis followed by the effective date after which a regulatory authority shouldhave considered it in reviewing a permit application under its regulatoryprogram. Notwithstanding this list, the violations review criteria of eachFederal and State regulatory program at the time of permit issuance willgovern the application of this rule. For a violation, penalty, or fee, the effective date in the list relatesto when a permit was issued, not when the violation became unabated orthe penalty or fee became delinquent, either of which may have occurredat any time prior to permit issuance. The listed violations, penaltiesand fees apply regardless of the issuing regulatory authority. Unless otherwisenoted, the same criteria apply equally to OSMRE and the States. Some Stateprograms may include more stringent criteria.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Applicable Violations Review Criteria</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">I. Violations, Penalties and Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A.

Other commenters said that the rule should not depend solely on informationcontained in the OSMRE Applicant/Violator System (AVS). Several commenterssaid that the preamble to the initial proposed rule was incorrect in suggestingthat only a failure to abate a ``serious'' violation constituted a ``failureto comply'' under section 201(c)(1) of the Act, and that this qualificationshould be deleted. The criteria to which the commenters objected were removed from the rule.Final andSection; 773.20(b)(l) does not specify any particular violation,penalty or fee as a basis for a finding that a permit was improvidentlyissued. Nor is it limited to the information contained in the AVS. Insteadit requires a regulatory authority to apply the violations review criteriaof the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued. OSMRE has concluded that because of differences between regulatory programs,as well as in the interpretation of the Act as experience has been gainedwith its requirements, it is best to adopt general procedures which relyon the specific requirements of each regulatory program for their ultimateinterpretation and application. The minimum types of unabated violationsand delinquent penalties and fees which the violations review criteriaof each regulatory program should cover are set out in the preceding list.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 518(f) Penalties </ITAG>Several commenters said that as the basis for permit rescission andSection;773.20 should cover any penalty for which a final order was issued to anentity with a common control relationship to a permittee, including penaltiesassessed under section 518(f) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1268(f), or the Stateprogram equivalent. OSMRE agrees. As discussed previously, the rule will apply to all penaltiesfor which a final order was issued under section 518 of the Act or a Stateprogram equivalent, including individual civil penalties under section518(f) or its equivalent. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Environmental Laws </ITAG>One commenter said that the initial proposed rule should apply not onlyto violations of the Act, but also of other environmental laws. OSMRE agrees. Under the violations review criteria of the regulatory programat the time the permit was issued, the rule can apply to violations ofany Federal or State law, rule or regulation pertaining to air or waterquality environmental protection in connection with any surface coal miningand reclamation operation. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Compliance </ITAG>The same commenter said that the rule should require a permit applicantto demonstrate compliance by having appropriate permits, and subsequentlyto remain in compliance with them. OSMRE did not adopt the commenter's suggestion. This rule provides remedialmeasures for permits that were improvidently issued as a result of an unabatedviolation or a delinquent penalty or fee of a related operation at thetime of permit issuance. Except for the overall violation of operatingunder an improvidently issued permit, it does not apply to any environmentalor other violation that may arise under the permit itself, or to any violationoccurring at another operation after permit issuance. <ITAG tagnum="81">Future Events </ITAG>One commenter said that the Act only authorized a regulatory authorityto decline to issue a permit based on existing compliance, but neitherauthorized nor required rescission based on future events. OSMRE agrees in part. To the extent the ``future event'' referred to bythe commenter concerns compliance with the regulatory program for operationsunder the permit in question, or to a violation at another operation afterthe issuance of the permit in question, the rescission procedures of therule do not apply. A regulatory authority may not use the rule to rescinda permit for any violation, penalty or fee resulting from such operations.To the extent the rule requires a regulatory authority to consider eventsfollowing permit issuance it is a reasonable means to identify and remedyimprovidently issued permits.Where a regulatory authority has reason to believe that a permit was improvidentlyissued, it legitimately may make the finding under this rule and take appropriateremedial measures, regardless of when the information concerning the violationstatus of the permittee at the time of permit issuance became available.Any other interpretation of the Act potentially would reward a permitteefor failing to bring compliance information to light at the time of permitissuance. Where a permit was issued on the presumption that a notice of violationwas in the process of being corrected, and a cessation order subsequentlywas issued, the lack of abatement following permit issuance is a conditionsubsequent of sufficient gravity to support rescission of the permit underthe Act. Thus, to the extent the ``future event'' concerns an ongoing lack of abatementof a past violation, or the delinquency of a penalty or fee for which aregulatory authority should have withheld a permit the rule is authorizedby sections 201 (c)(l) and (c)(2) and 510(c) of the Act. Section 201(c)(1) authorizes OSMRE to rescind a permit for a failure tocomply with the Act and its implementing regulations. A failure of a permitteeto comply with the permit withholding requirements of Act and its implementingregulations, or the State program equivalents, at the time of permit issuancebecause of an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty of fee is a failureto comply under section 201(c)(1).Under section 201(c)(2) of the Act, OSMRE and State regulatory authoritieshave the authority to correct errors in the issuance of permits throughpermit rescission and other appropriate remedial measures as a means ofcarrying out the purposes of sections 201(c)(1) and 510(c). Except for these limited circumstances, however, and the violation of operatingunder an improvidently issued permit, the rule does not concern any violation,penalty or fee arising under the permit itself, or arising after permitissuance under an ownership or control link to the permittee. <ITAG tagnum="81">Relationship to Revised Parker Order </ITAG>One commenter said that since the Revised Parker Order appeared to be theprincipal, if not the sole, reason for this rule, OSMRE should limit itsapplication to the limited universe of Federal violations and civil penaltiescovered by the order. OSMRE disagrees, and did not adopt the commenter'ssuggestion. The Revised Parker Order, to which the commenter referred, was issued bythe United States District Court for the District of Columbia in the caseof <T3>Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Clark, </T3>No. 81-2134 (D.D.C.January 31, 1985), and among other things concerned the implementationand enforcement of section 510(c). While this rule will facilitate compliance with the Revised Parker Order,it serves the broader purpose of bringing improvidently issued permitsinto compliance with the more encompassing requirements of the Act. Consistentwith this broader purpose, the rule is not limited by the specific violationsor penalties covered by the Revised Parker Order. <ITAG tagnum="81">Pre-1985 Federal Violations </ITAG>The same commenter said that the rule had the limited purpose of correctingpre-1985 Federal violations covered by the Revised Parker Order, so therewas no basis for extending it beyond those violations. To the extent therule applied to State violations, the commenter said, it was an intrusioninto the exclusive domain of State permitting. OSMRE disagrees. Neither section 510(c) of the Act nor 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)differentiates between Federal and State violations for purposes of withholdinga permit, and this rule is consistent with those requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">Statute of Limitations </ITAG>One commenter said that the five year statute of limitations for the collectionof fines and penalties prohibits using the mechanism of permit rescissionto force payment of civil penalties for which the statute has tolled. OSMRE disagrees. While a statute of limitations may act as a defense ina lawsuit filed to collect civil penalties, it does not cancel the underlyingdebt, and the failure to pay remains an act of noncompliance that is relevantin determining whether a permit was improvidently issued and imposing anappropriate remedial measure under this rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Ownership and Control Criteria at Time of Permit Issuance </ITAG>Later proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(4)(ii)(A) set out specific ownershipand control relationships to which the rule would apply. Several commenterssaid the rule should cover operations that had an outstanding violation,penalty or fee and were in an ownership or control relationship with thepermit applicant in a manner consistent with the Act and the regulationsat the time of permit issuance. These commenters cited section 507(b)(4)of the Act and the Revised Parker Order to support their interpretationof which relationships were consistent with the Act. OSMRE agrees with these commenters that the applicable criteria for determiningownership and control relationships under this rule are those in forceat the time the permit was issued. As a result of these comments, all specificownership and control criteria were deleted from the rule. Instead, the rule requires the regulatory authority to base its findingthat a permit was improvidently issued on the violations review criteriaof the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued, includingthose criteria relating to ownership and control. The minimum ownershipand control relationships which OSMRE believes the violations review criteriaof a regulatory program should include are set out in the preceding list.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 507(b)(4) of the Act </ITAG>Several commenters said that until the ownership and control rule was promulgatedand adopted by the States, it appeared that later proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(4)(ii)(A)(1)would, <T3>de facto, </T3>define ownership and control to include those entitieslisted in section 507(b)(4) of the Act. They said that this was consistentwith the Revised Parker Order, which mandated the use of this standard.They disagreed with the proposed limitation of this standard to ``appropriatecircumstances.''These same commenters said that the proposed rule was unclear on when inthe development of a regulatory program those entities listed in section507(b)(4) would serve as the basis for an ownership and control determinationby a State regulatory authority, which the commenter said should beginwith primacy. In addition, they said that under the rule the applicabilityof the term <T3>owns or controls </T3>in a regulatory program should begin with primacy.The final rule no longer specifies the ownership and control relationshipsreferred to by these commenters, but instead requires a regulatory authorityto apply the ownership and control criteria of the regulatory program atthe time the permit was issued. Nevertheless, because their reasoning alsomight apply to those criteria, it is necessary to explain why OSMRE disagreeswith a number of the commenters' conclusions. OSMRE agrees that the obligation of a State regulatory authority to withholda permit in accordance with section 510(c) of the Act begins with primacy.OSMRE disagrees, however, with the commenters' interpretation of section507(b)(4) of the Act and the Revised Parker Order. For a discussion of the relationship between the requirements of sections507(b)(4) and 510(c) of the Act in this context, as reflected in the RevisedParker Order, see the ownership and control rule at 53 FR 38874-38875.As stated there, the Congress intended to give a regulatory authority discretionto determine whether any person named under section 507(b)(4) in fact ownsor controls a permit applicant. The Revised Parker Order, which in footnote No. l provides that OSMREshall use no less inclusive a class of persons than is set out in section507(b)(4) when establishing and implementing the Applicant/Violator System,merely requires OSMRE to consider whether those persons are owners or controllers,not to find inflexibly in all cases that they are.<ITAG tagnum="81">Corporate Separateness</ITAG> Several commenters objected to the proposed rule to the extent it broadlyapplied the concept of ownership and control under section 510(c) of theAct. One said that in doing so the rule ignored established legal conceptsof corporate separateness. The commenter said that due to a lack of authorityto direct the actions of an affiliated company a permittee who was linkedto a violation, penalty or fee through ownership or control would not beable to abate the violation or enter into an abatement plan or paymentschedule, as provided by initial proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(2). OSMRE does not believe that this rule is the proper forum to reconsiderthe previously established scope of ownership or control relationshipsunder section 510 (c) of the Act or a regulatory program. For the currentOSMRE policy and procedures on this topic, see the October 3, 1988 (53FR 38868) OSMRE final rule on ownership and control. OSMRE agrees with the commenter that the initial proposed language, whichappeared to require a permittee to abate a violation for which the permitteewas not responsible, might have placed a permittee in an untenable position.Therefore, the later proposed and final rules were revised to provide thatthe necessary corrective action may be taken either by the permittee orby the ``other person responsible.''<ITAG tagnum="81">Parent-Subsidiary Relationships</ITAG> One commenter on initial proposed andSection; 773.20 said that ownershipand control considerations should apply only down, and not up, the corporateladder. OSMRE disagrees. Where the violations review criteria of the regulatoryprogram at the time of permit issuance trace ownership or control up thecorporate ladder, they are a legitimate basis for applying this rule. Fora discussion of how ownership and control links may be traced up and downa corporate ladder, see the ownership and control rule at 53 FR 38875. Another commenter objected to initial proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(1)for requiring the issuance of an NOV to a subsidiary permittee where theparent company was responsible for the underlying violation, penalty orfee. The commenter said that a subsidiary company has no authority to dictatewhat must be done by its parent, and that it was inconceivable that anygood could come from penalizing a subsidiary for the actions of the parent. OSMRE disagrees. While final andSection; 773.20 no longer provides for theissuance of an NOV, it includes other remedial measures which may be imposedon a subsidiary because of an ownership or control link to a parent company.Where such a link exists, the authority of the subsidiary to dictate theactions of the parent is irrelevant. A parent company has a definite economicinterest in the continuing viability of its subsidiaries, and the rulewill provide a strong incentive for the parent to abate any outstandingviolation or pay any delinquent penalty or fee so that a subsidiary cancontinue to operate.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Coverage of Operators </ITAG>Other commenters said that OSMRE should revise initial proposed andSection;773.20(a)(1) to specifically include the operator as having a control linkto the permittee.OSMRE did not adopt this suggestion. As previously discussed, the rulenow incorporates the ownership and control criteria of the regulatory programat the time the permit was issued, including the operator in appropriatecircumstances. For a discussion of how an ownership or control link maybe traced through an operator, see the ownership and control rule at 53FR 38873. <ITAG tagnum="81">Attribution of Violations </ITAG>One commenter said that the essence of this rule and the ownership andcontrol rule was to attribute violations from one legal entity to another.The commenter said that it would be more expedient to seek a court ordercompelling abatement of the underlying violation than to adopt the passiveapproach of the rule. Another commenter said that the rule would imputeto a permittee third party liability for a violation, penalty or fee. OSMRE disagrees. As explained more fully in the October 3, 1988 (53 FR38868) ownership and control rule, neither that rule nor this one makesone legal entity responsible for abating the violation or paying the penaltyor fee of another. As authorized by sections 201(c) and 510(c) of the Act, these rules insteaddeny persons who through ownership or control are linked to a person responsiblefor an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee the privilegeof obtaining or retaining a surface coal mining and reclamation permit.<ITAG tagnum="81">Fraud, Misrepresentation and Lack of Knowledge </ITAG>Several commenters on the later proposed rule said that the criteria offraud, misrepresentation, lack of knowledge, and good faith on the partof the permittee or regulatory authority in later proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(4)were immaterial. These commenters said that the criteria improperly shiftedthe focus of the inquiry away from whether an applicant had an outstandingviolation to whether the regulatory authority knew or should have knownof the violation. The commenters said that use of these criteria wouldunfairly award abuse or incompetence. The proposed criteria concerning fraud, misrepresentation and lack of knowledge,to which the commenters objected, were removed from final andSection; 773.20(b)of the rule. Instead, the regulatory authority is to apply the violationsreview criteria of the regulatory program at the time the permit was issued.The criterion concerning good faith, to which the commenters also objected,does not concern permit issuance and was retained in andSection; 773.20(b)(2)(ii)of the rule as a reasonable measure of a permittee's justification forappealing an unabated violation or delinquent penalty or fee for whicha regulatory authority should not have issued a permit. Other commenters said that the later proposed rule defined the term <T3>known or should have known </T3>too narrowly, and that the rule shouldapply whenever pertinent information becomes known to the regulatory authority.They added that since a permit applicant has an independent responsibilityto comply with the Act and its implementing regulations, regardless ofany inaction on the part of the regulatory authority, the action takenby a regulatory authority to remedy its prior inaction on an improvidentlyissued permit would not penalize a permittee. OSMRE disagrees. Although this explicit criterion was removed from therule, a regulatory authority's lack of knowledge of an existing violationat the time of permit issuance is a relevant consideration in determiningwhether a permit was improvidently issued, and is inherent in the violationsreview criteria of each regulatory program. Section 510(c) of the Act does not impose on an applicant an unlimitedresponsibility to submit violations information, as the commenters infer,but is limited to certain notices of violations incurred during a certainperiod of time preceding the application. And under section 510(c) and30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) a violations review must be based on information ``availableto the regulatory authority.'' The existence of an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee atthe time of permit issuance does not invalidate a determination by a regulatoryauthority that none existed unless information concerning the violation,penalty or fee was available to the regulatory authority, or should havebeen available if the permit application were complete and accurate, orif the regulatory authority had made reasonable inquiries. At a minimum,for permits issued after October 1, 1987 such reasonable inquiries wouldinclude querying the Applicant/Violator System. The discovery of a pre-existing violation after permit issuance shouldnot automatically lead to the conclusion that the permit was improvidentlyissued if the regulatory authority could not reasonably have been madeaware of the violation at the time the permit was issued. Similarly, sucha discovery does not necessarily mean that an operator's activities underthe permit were conducted in violation of the regulatory program. Thisstandard for violations review will not, as the commenters suggested, awardabuse or incompetence because it covers not only actual knowledge, butalso what the regulatory authority reasonably should have known. Several commenters asked OSMRE to clarify that the rule will apply notonly in situations where a regulatory authority had the information necessaryto block a permit at the time it was issued, but also where the informationwas obtained after the permit was issued. OSMRE agrees that this is the correct interpretation of the rule in situationswhere the permit applicant should have provided the information in thepermit application, or where the regulatory authority could have obtainedthe information with reasonable inquiry. <ITAG tagnum="81">Erroneous AVS Information </ITAG>One commenter asked how erroneous information in the OSMRE Applicant/ViolatorSystem (AVS) would affect the responsibility of a regulatory authorityunder initial proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(4)(ii) for knowing about outstandingviolations, penalties or fees. Although the rule no longer explicitly includes the criterion to whichthe comment applies, the question remains relevant. Subject to the reviewstandard set out in the preceding discussion, a regulatory authority mayrely on the information in the AVS as up-to-date and accurate.As explained previously, under section 510(c) of the Act and 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1)a violations review reasonably must cover the information ``available tothe regulatory authority.'' Due to its voluminous extent, OSMRE has foundit necessary to establish the computer-based AVS as a means to provideaccess to this information. Under this rule a proper query of the AVS will constitute a reasonableinquiry of the information available to the regulatory authority, and absentsome defect in the violations information provided in the permit application,or inadequate use of other information that actually was known to the regulatoryauthority, an error in or omission from the information in the AVS willnot provide the basis for a finding that a permit was improvidently issued.b. Section 773.20(b)(2). The second criterion, in andSection; 773.20(b)(2),is that the violation, penalty or fee for which the regulatory authorityshould have withheld the permit remains unabated or delinquent, and isnot the subject of a good faith appeal, or of an abatement plan or paymentschedule with which the permittee or other person responsible is complyingto the satisfaction of the responsible agency. This criterion is essentially the same as proposed. It is included in therule because from the standpoint of administrative efficiency it makeslittle sense to rescind a permit where the underlying violation, penaltyor fee would not currently bar the issuance of a new permit. Where thedefect in the permit either has been or is in the process of being corrected,this criterion will obviate the unproductive rescission of, reapplicationfor, and reissuance of what ultimately would amount to the same permit.As a result of this criterion, abatement of the underlying violation orpayment of the delinquent penalty or fee to the satisfaction of the responsibleagency subsequent to permit issuance will preclude a finding that a permitwas improvidently issued. In addition, if the violation, penalty or feeis the subject of a good faith appeal or payment schedule at the time ofpermit review under this section, the regulatory authority will not findthat the permit was improvidently issued. If the permittee or other person responsible loses the appeal, however,or fails to comply with the abatement plan or payment schedule, and theregulatory authority did not consider the appeal, abatement plan, or paymentschedule and conditionally issue the permit, the procedures of this rulewill apply. Where the permit was conditionally issued, the provisions ofthe regulatory program governing noncompliance with a permit condition,and not this rule, will apply. c. <T3>Section 773.20(b)(3). </T3>The third criterion, in andSection; 773.20(b)(3),is that where the permittee was linked to the violation, penalty or feethrough ownership or control, under the violations review criteria of theregulatory program at the time the permit was issued an ownership or controllink still exists between the permittee and the person responsible forthe violation, penalty or fee, or where the link was severed the permitteecontinues to be responsible for the violation, penalty or fee. This criterion is similar to later proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(3). Itwas expanded in response to public comment to require a finding of improvidentissuance where a permittee continues to be responsible for an unabatedviolation or a delinquent penalty or fee, notwithstanding the severingof a previous ownership or control link. Like previously discussed andSection; 773.20(b)(2), this provision is includedin the rule for reasons of administrative efficiency. Where no ownershipor control link currently exists between the permittee and the person responsiblefor the underlying violation, penalty or fee, and the permittee has nocontinuing responsibility for the violation, penalty or fee, and thus theexistence of the violation, penalty or fee would not currently bar theissuance of a new permit, it makes little sense to rescind the permit and,inevitably, issue a new one. If an ownership or control link between a permittee and the person responsiblefor a violation, penalty or fee is severed after permit issuance, but laterreestablished, this section would not preclude a subsequent finding thatthe permit was improvidently issued. The requirement of this rule for a current ownership or control link betweenthe permittee and the person responsible, or continuing responsibilityon the part of the permittee, recognizes that there is little to be gainedby applying the remedial measures of this rule to an existing permit ifthat critical link or responsibility no longer exists. A fundamental purpose of section 510(c) of the Act is to ensure that unabatedviolations and delinquent penalties and fees associated with previous permitsare abated or paid before another permit is issued. Where a permittee nolonger bears any responsibility for, or has the requisite control to causethe abatement or payment of a previous violation, penalty or fee, however,it is consistent with section 510(c) for the regulatory authority to refrainfrom taking remedial action against the permit. Since under section 510(c) a permit <T3>applicant </T3>legitimately may sever his or her ownership or controllink with the person responsible for a violation, penalty or fee, and thusreceive a permit, it is reasonable to afford a <T3>permittee </T3>a similar opportunity once a permit is issued. Like andSection; 773.20(b)(1) of this rule, andSection; 773.20(b)(3) basesthe continuing existence of an ownership or control link, and of the responsibilityof the permittee for a violation, penalty or fee, on the criteria of theregulatory program at the time the permit was issued. OSMRE consideredbut rejected the alternative of applying the violations review criteriain force at the time a permit is reviewed under this section because itwould have subjected the permittee to a standard that might be subjectto change or reinterpretation. <ITAG tagnum="81">Relationship Between Permittee and Violation, Penalty or Fee </ITAG>To facilitate the interpretation of this rule, it is useful to differentiatethree ways in which a permittee can be related to an unabated violationor a delinquent penalty or fee for purposes of section 510(c) of the Actand its implementing violations review criteria. The permittee can be (1)directly responsible for the violation, penalty or fee; (2) indirectlyresponsible; or (3) linked to the violation, penalty or fee through ownershipor control.Direct responsibility arises where the permittee is cited on the violationnotice or penalty assessment, or specifically is identified in a requirementto pay a fee. Indirect responsibility may arise through an ownership or control linkunder certain circumstances where the permittee <T3>owns or controls </T3>the person who is directly responsible. Indirectresponsibility generally will not arise through an ownership or controllink where the permittee <T3>is owned or controlled by </T3>the person responsible. A link through ownership or control arises where, under the violationsreview criteria of the applicable regulatory program, the permittee eitherowns or controls, or is owned or controlled by, the person directly responsiblefor a violation, penalty or fee. The use of these three categories to differentiate these possible relationshipsbetween a permittee and a violation, penalty or fee is consistent withthe relevant provisions of section 510(c) of the Act and its implementingviolations review criteria, which preclude the issuance of a permit onlywhere a permit applicant is either directly or indirectly is responsiblefor, or through an ownership or control relationship is linked to, an unabatedviolation or a delinquent penalty or fee. <ITAG tagnum="81">Correcting Defect in Permit </ITAG>Where a permittee is either directly or indirectly responsible for an unabatedviolation or a delinquent penalty or fee, he or she cannot avoid this responsibilityby severing his or her link with any other person. The only way to satisfythis responsibility is to prevail in an appeal, abate the violation, orpay the penalty or fee. If the permittee or other person responsible doesso, this rule will allow the permit to remain in force. (For additionaldiscussion of the circumstances under which a permittee continues to beindirectly responsible for the violation, penalty or fee of a former subsidiary,see the ownership and control rule at 53 FR 38876.) Where a permittee is linked to a violation, penalty or fee only throughownership or control, and has no direct or indirect responsibility forthe violation, penalty or fee, the permittee may correct the defect inthe permit and forestall the remedial measures of this rule by severingthe ownership or control link. This is because under such circumstancesthe purpose of this rule is not to compel abatement or payment by the permittee,but to compel abatement or payment by the person responsible. Where an ownership or control link continues to exist, the purpose of thisrule is to prevent the person responsible from evading the prohibitionof section 510(c) of the Act by using an intermediary, to which he or sheis linked by ownership or control, to obtain and retain a permit whichhe or she otherwise could not have obtained or retained. Where the linkis broken, however, the person responsible no longer has an interest inthe permit that would serve to compel abatement or payment. <ITAG tagnum="81">Current Ownership or Control Link </ITAG>Several commenters favored the later proposed requirement for a currentownership or control link as a basis for a finding that a permit was improvidentlyissued. They said that a current link between the permittee and violatorwould have to exist if this rule were to achieve its stated objective ofcompelling the abatement of existing violations. One commenter said thatin the absence of such a link the rule would place the permittee in a positionwhere compliance would be impossible, and would make the rule more difficultto defend with respect to retroactive application. OSMRE agrees with the commenter that where a permittee has no direct orindirect responsibility for an unabated violation or a delinquent penaltyor fee, a current ownership or control link is a necessary measure of theability of the regulatory authority to compel compliance, and thus to remedythe defect in the permit. As explained under the subsequent heading, II.F.3.The Rule is not retroactive, however, OSMRE disagrees that the rule inany way is retroactive. Several commenters on the later proposed rule said that it was contraryto the Act to require a current ownership or control link as a criterionthat a permit was improvidently issued. They said that this would providean untimely incentive for permittees to sever links to avoid liabilityfor operations under common ownership or control at the time of permitissuance. OSMRE disagrees. As explained in the preceding discussion of andSection;773.20(b)(3), in the absence of any direct or indirect responsibility onthe part of the permittee for an unabated violation or a delinquent penaltyor fee, the rule requires a current ownership or control link for reasonsof administrative efficiency and because there is nothing to be gainedby rescinding a permit where the permittee is not responsible for and willnot be able to bring about abatement or payment. Section 510(c) of the Act does not require a regulatory authority to withholda permit from an applicant who at any time in the past was linked to aviolator through ownership or control. Thus, prior to applying for a permit,an applicant may sever his or her link to the person responsible for anunabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee and legitimately receivea permit.In the same manner, it is reasonable for this rule to give a permitteean opportunity to sever an ownership or control link to the person responsible,and thereby forestall a finding that the permit was improvidently issued.As long as the link legitimately is severed, and the permittee does notcontinue to be directly or indirectly responsible for the violation, penaltyor fee, the purposes of the Act are fully served. Several commenters on the later proposed rule said that the withholdingof a permit under section 510(c) and the rescission of a permit under thisrule had two purposes: (1) To provide an incentive for a coal operatorto correct past violations if he or she wished to continue mining coal;and (2) to prevent an operator who failed to comply with the law from miningcoal. The commenters said that regardless of a current link between the permitteeand the violator, permit rescission would provide a strong incentive tocorrect unabated violations and pay delinquent penalties. The commenterssaid that the rule overlooked the second purpose, and concluded that acurrent ownership or control link should not be required. OSMRE agrees with the commenters on the dual purposes of withholding apermit under section 510(c), and for applying the remedial measures ofthis rule. In response to this comment, andSection; 773.20(b)(3) was revisedto require a finding of improvident issuance where a permittee continuesto be responsible for an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty orfee, notwithstanding the severing of a previous ownership or control link.This revision will enhance the capacity of the rule to serve the secondpurpose of section 510(c) by subjecting a permittee who continues to beresponsible for an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee toits remedial measures. OSMRE disagrees with the commenters, however, that requiring a currentownership or control link where a permittee does not continue to be responsiblefor a violation, penalty or fee is inconsistent with the purposes of section510(c). As the commenters pointed out, the remedial measures of this rulewill provide a strong incentive for a permittee to abate a violation orpay a delinquent penalty or fee for which he or she continues to be responsibleand for which the regulatory authority should have withheld a permit. Where the permittee has no direct or indirect responsibility for the violation,penalty or fee, however, this incentive can arise only where there is acurrent link between the permittee and the person responsible. Where thelink is broken, the permittee is unlikely to have any relationship withthe violator that might serve to bring about compliance, and the rule cannotprovide the desired compliance incentive. Notwithstanding its requirement for a current ownership or control link,this rule will effectively serve the second purpose noted by the commenters.It will enable regulatory authorities to prevent non-complying personsfrom retaining or otherwise continuing to operate under permits they shouldnot have received. And it will give persons responsible an additional incentiveto abate violations and pay delinquent penalties and fees because not doingso will prevent them from forming or maintaining viable ownership or controlrelationships with other prospective permittees. Where the relevant ownership or control relationship continues to exist,so the violation, penalty or fee legitimately can be linked to the permittee,the rule requires the regulatory authority to take appropriate remedialaction. But where the ownership or control link with the person responsibleis severed, and the permittee has no direct or indirect responsibilityfor the violation, penalty or fee, the permittee cannot be considered tohave a bad mining record requiring remedial action under this rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Severing Ownership or Control Link </ITAG>Several commenters on the later proposed rule were concerned that the requirementfor a current ownership or control link unlawfully would enable a permitteeto break his or her connection with a non-complying mining operation andthus retain his or her permit. As examples of how this might be done, thecommenters said that a partnership might be dissolved; a mining contractmight expire or be terminated; a corporation might be dissolved, or liquidatedin bankruptcy; or an operator might convey his or her interest in the operationto another party. In response to this and a comment discussed under the preceding heading,andSection; 773.20(b)(3) was revised to require a finding of improvidentissuance where a permittee continues to be responsible for an unabatedviolation or a delinquent penalty or fee, notwithstanding any severingof the ownership or control link under which that responsibility arose.This revision will prevent a permittee who severs such a link from avoidingthe responsibility he or she may continue to have for an unabated violationor delinquent penalty or fee. For the reasons discussed under the precedingheading, however, OSMRE disagrees that the requirement of andSection; 773.20(b)(3)for a current ownership or control link in the absence of such continuingresponsibility provides any reason for the commenters' concern. Depending on the review criteria of the applicable regulatory program,an ownership or control link between a permittee and a person responsiblefor an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee may arise andbe severed in a variety of ways. To use the examples cited by the commenters:The dissolution of a partnership will not relieve the partners of any previously-heldresponsibility for an unabated violation, or for a delinquent penalty orfee as owners or controllers of the partnership. Nor will the expirationor termination of a mining contract necessarily relieve the parties tothe contract of any previously-held responsibility. The dissolution orliquidation of a corporation in bankruptcy will not relieve any officer,director or other owner or controller of the corporation of his or herprevious responsibility for operations conducted by, or under the ownershipor control of, the corporation. However, where a permittee has no personal responsibility for a violation,penalty or fee, and effectively severs his or her link with the personresponsible, there no longer exists any reason to consider permit rescissionor other remedial action under this rule. At that point the slate is asclean as it should have been on the date the permit was issued, and itnot only is reasonable, but also fully in compliance with the Act and itsimplementing regulations, to allow the permittee to retain the permit andcontinue to operate without interruption.<ITAG tagnum="81">Inconsistent Terminology </ITAG>One commenter said that while initial proposed andSection; 773.20(a) referredto any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by either thepermittee or by any person who owns or controls the permittee, this terminologywas not consistently carried through the remainder of that section. OSMRE agrees with the commenter that these same ownership and control relationshipsshould have been included throughout initial proposed andSection; 773.20,as they were in later proposed andSection; 773.20. Rather than explicitlysetting out the applicable ownership and control relationships, however,final andSection; 773.20(b)(1) and (b)(3) now refer generally to ``the violationsreview criteria of the regulatory program,'' which covers any applicableownership or control relationship. In addition, andSection; 773.20(b)(2)(ii), (b)(3), (c)(1) and (c)(2), referto the ``person responsible,'' as do andSection;andSection; 773.21 and 843.2lof this rule, which covers any person related to the permittee throughownership or control who is responsible for an unabated violation or adelinquent penalty or fee. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 773.20(c) Remedial Measures </ITAG>Where a regulatory authority finds, under andSection; 773.20(b) of this rule,that a surface coal mining and reclamation permit was improvidently issued,andSection; 773.20(c) requires it to use one or more of four specified remedialmeasures: To (1) implement an abatement plan or payment schedule; (2) imposea permit condition; (3) suspend the permit; or (4) rescind the permit.In combination with one or more of these remedial measures, a regulatoryauthority also may use any other measure available under its regulatoryprogram. This section derives from later proposed andSection; 773.20(b). It includesfour alternative remedial measures because of the diversity of circumstancesunder which a regulatory authority might find that a permit was improvidentlyissued, and the resulting need to apply a remedy that not only is administrativelyappropriate, but also is fair and equitable to the permittee. Again, from the standpoint of administrative efficiency it is consistentwith section 510(c) of the Act to adopt alternative remedial measures throughwhich a regulatory authority can afford a permittee a reasonable periodof time to correct the defect in the permit and achieve a state of compliancethat neither would have caused the regulatory authority to withhold thepermit initially or have led to a finding of improvident issuance underthis rule. While mandatory rescission might in some instances prompt a permittee toachieve compliance more rapidly, in other instances it might, through lossof income or default on contractural or other legal or financial obligations,effectively thwart a permittee's ability to do so. Moreover, mandatory rescission could produce grossly inequitable resultswhere a permit was improvidently issued through oversight or error on thepart of the regulatory authority, and notwithstanding a relatively minorpast violation the permittee or its employees would suffer considerablehardship if mining under the permit abruptly were terminated. In view of the administrative and equitable considerations involved, thisrule is intended to strike the reasonable balance sought by section 202(f)of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">Need for Remedies Other Than Rescission </ITAG>Several commenters on the initial proposed rule objected to permit rescissionas the sole remedy for an improvidently issued permit. One commenter saidthat in circumstances involving a nominal penalty it was inconceivablethat the only remedy available to the regulatory authority to accomplishthe desired result was to rescind the permit and require reclamation ofthe operation. The commenter said that rescission would be particularlyburdensome to large operators in the west, and recommended revision ofthe rule to include alternative remedies. Another commenter said that while permit rescission may at times be warrantedand appropriate, the rule should include discretion for permit suspension,both as an independent remedy and as the first step in the rescission process,to give all parties an opportunity to ensure that no errors had been made.Another commenter said that suspension, rather than rescission, was themore appropriate sanction in most circumstances addressed by initial proposedandSection; 773.20(c). This commenter said that in cases of fraud or misrepresentationrescission was the appropriate sanction, but where a permit was issuedthrough human error or a lack of current information rescission would beunnecessarily harsh. The commenter said that both suspension and rescissionwould have the desired effect, but only suspension would facilitate thetimely resumption of operations. Another commenter said that the rule should include provision for suspendinga permit as provided by section 521(b) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1271(b). Thiscommenter said that because of delays in the repermitting process, permitrescission would delay mining at a site for a period of at least six monthsto two years. The commenter said that this would increase the burden onregulatory authorities because many of the affected operators would becomeinsolvent, and thus default on penalties and fees, as well as forfeit theirperformance bonds. A much better solution, the commenter said, was to suspend a permit untilthe defect in the permit was corrected. This not only would give a permitteea strong financial incentive to correct the defect, the commenter said,but also would increase the likelihood that the regulatory authority wouldcollect the penalties and fees that were owed. Another commenter said that the additional remedial measures in later proposedandSection; 773.20(b) provided the flexibility necessary to resolve the problemthrough the most effective means available under each regulatory program.OSMRE agrees that because of differences in the circumstances involvingeach improvidently issued permit, alternatives to permit rescission areneeded, and has revised the later proposed and final rules accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">Suspension and Rescission as Sole Remedy </ITAG>Several commenters disagreed with the alternative remedial measures inlater proposed andSection; 773.20(b), and said that regardless of what definitionswere applied or distinctions were drawn, once it was determined that apermit was issued in violation of section 510(c) of the Act the remedymandated by law was permit suspension or revocation. These commenters characterizedsection 201(c)(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1211(c)(1), as unmistakably mandatoryin nature, requiring that the regulatory authority <T3>shall </T3>order the suspension or revocation of the permit. Likewise, the commenters said, section 510(b)(1) of the Act demands thata permit application be accurate and complete and that all of the requirementsof the Act and the regulatory program be complied with before the applicationis approved. Moreover, they said, the requirements of section 510(c) thata permit applicant list any and all notices of violations, and that theregulatory authority not issue a permit under certain circumstances, areequally demanding. Citing the legislative history of the Act for support, the commenters saidthat under section 510(b), (b)(1) and (c) of the Act an applicant has aduty to provide information to the regulatory authority on any and allviolations of environmental laws, and that absent an affirmative demonstrationby the applicant that he or she has met all of the requirements of theAct no permit can lawfully be issued. Based on these provisions of theAct, the commenters concluded that the suspension and revocation of animprovidently issued permit was required regardless of any mitigating circumstancesinvolved in its issuance.OSMRE disagrees. For the reason why OSMRE prefers to use the term <T3>rescission </T3>in the context of an improvidently issued permit, asopposed to the commenters' term <T3>revocation, </T3>see the discussion of Permit Rescission vs. Revocationunder the subsequent heading, II.F.1. Statutory Authority. Contrary to the commenters' allegations, section 510(c) of the Act doesnot require an applicant to list all violations, but is limited to certainnotices of violations incurred during a certain period of time prior tothe date of the application. Moreover, the commenters' excessively strict reading of section 201(c)(1)of the Act would necessitate permit suspension and rescission for any violationof the Act, which could result in economic hardship and disruption theCongress clearly did not intend to cause despite any mitigating circumstances.OSMRE concludes that it has sufficient discretion under the Act to adoptprocedures which reasonably account for the circumstances under which apermit was improvidently issued, and which include alternative remedialmeasures that will enable the regulatory authority to consider those circumstancesin taking appropriate remedial action against the permit. Contrary to several commenters' allegations, the term <T3>improvidently issued </T3>is not intended as a euphemism. Rather, OSMREbelieves that the term reflects the severity of the problem involved whena regulatory authority should not have issued a permit, while at the sametime not foreclosing reasonable flexibility in the adoption of appropriateremedial measures. In a process as complex as the filing and review ofa permit application it is unavoidable that some errors may be made, eitherby the applicant or by the regulatory authority, which will require correctionor modification of the permit once it is issued. The all-or-nothing interpretation of the Act espoused by the commenterswould lock this process into a state of rigidity that is contrary to thepurposes of the Act and is inconsistent with the efficient and effectiveadministration of its requirements and sound environmental policy. Thus,OSMRE declines to interpret the Act as inflexibly requiring permit suspensionand rescission regardless of the circumstances under which a permit wasimprovidently issued. <ITAG tagnum="81">Void vs. Voidable Permits </ITAG>One commenter said that in view of the elaborate and detailed permit reviewprocess provided by the Congress, a presumption of validity accompaniesa regulatory authority's decision to issue a permit. OSMRE agrees. Several commenters on the later proposed rule said that sections 510 (b)and (c) of the Act are mandatory provisions, and any failure on the partof a permit applicant to divulge relevant violations renders the permitin violation of the law and subject to mandatory suspension or revocationunder section 201(c)(1) of the Act. The commenters said that there is noroom for failing to take action to rescind or suspend a permit based onregulatory authority or applicant inadvertance. Citing several court decisionsto support this allegation, the commenters said that the issuance of apermit in contravention of the mandatory prerequisites for valid issuancerenders the permit <T3>void ab initio </T3>and a legal nullity. OSMRE disagrees with the commenters that suspension and rescission arethe only lawful remedies for an improvidently issued permit. The Congressdid not intend the extreme measures in section 201(c)(1) as exclusive remedies.Section 201(c)(2) of the Act provides authority for less extreme measuressufficient to carry out the purposes and provisions of the Act.Because determining the validity of a particular permit under section 510(c)is not always as clearcut as the commenters allege, OSMRE is reluctantto require permit suspension or rescission in every instance. The caselaw cited by the commenters to support their allegation concerned Federalagency regulations, not permits, and thus is relevant in this context onlyby the broadest analogy, upon which OSMRE is reluctant to rely in promulgatinga national rule. This rule need not and cannot conclusively resolve the issue of whethera particular permit is either void or voidable. Through the alternativeremedial measures in andSection; 773.20(c), which range from the implementationof an abatement plan or payment schedule to permit rescission, the ruleaffords the regulatory authority reasonable discretion to consider thecircumstances involving a particular improvidently issued permit and tofashion an appropriate remedy. Rather than specifying in legalistic detail the circumstances under whicha regulatory authority must consider a permit void, and thus subject torescission, this rule reasonably leaves the question to the informed discretionof the regulatory authority for determination on a case-by-case basis.Although the rule does not require a regulatory authority to use any particularone of the four remedial measures, OSMRE intends that the measure or measuresused will be commensurate with the circumstances under which a permit wasimprovidently issued. Where a permit was issued through willful fraud or collusion on the partof the permittee, rescission must be given serious consideration as theonly appropriate remedy. Where a permit was issued because the regulatoryauthority itself did not fully implement the violations review criteriaof the regulatory program, a remedy other than rescission may be more appropriate.Where a remedial measure other than rescission is used, and the permitteefails to comply with the measure, the regulatory authority should reconsiderits finding, and where appropriate rescind the permit. This interpretation of the requirements of the Act for permit rescissionunder section 510(c) is consistent with the analagous requirements of section521(b) of the Act, which provides that<ITAG tagnum="20">in the case of a State permittee who has met his obligations undersuch permit and who did not willfully secure the issuance of such permitthrough fraud or collusion, the Secretary shall give the permittee a reasonabletime to conform ongoing surface mining and reclamation to the requirementsof this Act before suspending or revoking the State permit.</ITAG>This provision in section 521(b) authorizes OSMRE to use remedial measuresother than suspension or revocation when enforcing a defective State permit,as a means of bringing the permit into conformance with the regulatoryprogram. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that this rule, which includesalternatives to permit suspension and rescission, conforms with the intentof the Congress on how regulatory authorities should deal with improvidentlyissued permits. <ITAG tagnum="81">Two-Acre Violations </ITAG>The same commenters cited the experience of a State regulatory authorityunder `` `two-acre' permits'' as evidence of how a lack of suspension orrescission would pose undesirable risks to the public and the environment.Where notices of violation rather than cessation orders were issued fortwo-acre violations, the commenter said, the lack of a requirement to immediatelycease operations resulted in additional disturbance and subsequent abandonmentof the affected sites. OSMRE disagrees that the context of this rule is analagous to the two-acresituation described by the commenters. In the case of an improvidentlyissued permit, the underlying violation, penalty or fee did not arise fromthe mining operation under the permit, but from another operation. Suspension or rescission of the permit would not necessarily bring aboutcompliance at the other operation any more effectively than the other remedialmeasures of this rule. Moreover, any violation stemming from operationsunder an improvidently issued permit itself is subject to enforcement underthe applicable regulatory program, including the issuance of a cessationorder where appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">Suggested Alternatives to Rule </ITAG>One commenter on the initial proposed rule said that permit rescissionshould be made an optional enforcement mechanism. OSMRE has adopted thissuggestion by including in andSection; 773.20(c) remedial measures otherthan permit rescission, one or more of which a regulatory authority mustuse where it finds that a permit was improvidently issued. One initial commenter suggested specific alternative procedures for a permitsuspension process initiated by an order to the permittee to show cause.Under the alternative, where the permittee failed either to show that theregulatory authority's findings were in error, or to correct the defectin the permit, the permit temporarily would be suspended and the permitteewould be required to commence reclamation. If the defect subsequently werecorrected, the regulatory authority would reinstate the permit. The commenterconcluded that this alternative more closely conformed with the provisionsof section 521(a)(4) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1271(a)(4), concerning the suspensionof permits. OSMRE disagrees that the suspension procedures suggested by the commenterare preferable to those of this rule. The referenced section 521(a)(4)of the Act applies only to suspension or revocation of a permit for a patternof violations <T3>under that permit, </T3>not to the improvident issuance of a permitbecause of an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee <T3>at another operation. </T3>Moreover, the commenter's alternative failsto provide for permit rescission, a necessary remedial measure under appropriatecircumstances. Several commenters said that the rule was unnecessary in view of the enforcementmeasures already available to OSMRE and State regulatory authorities fordealing with improvidently issued permits. One said that the rule wouldput numerous contract miners out of work because a large company couldnot take the risk that a contractor might have failed to abate a violationor pay a penalty or fee in connection with another operation. This, thecommenter said, could result in the closing of a large company's minesand the forcing of contract miners out of business. Another commenter said that the rule created unnecessary obligations, andthat a more focused approach to the problem would be a more prudent course.Another said that instead of issuing a new rule, OSMRE should develop auniform and consistent policy or procedure for progressive enforcementactions against failures to abate violations and the nonpayment of civilpenalties or reclamation fees.The commenter said that instead of permit rescission, the regulatory authorityshould use existing procedures, such as better enforcement and the issuanceof a notice of violation followed by a failure-to-abate cessation order.If compliance, or satisfactory progress toward compliance, were not achievedwithin ninety days, the earlier permit would be suspended. Failure to reclaimor to comply ultimately would result in bond forfeiture and revocationof the earlier permit. OSMRE disagrees. This rule is needed to give regulatory authorities specificprocedures which the existing regulatory scheme does not provide for dealingwith improvidently issued permits. As such, it will provide not only the``focused approach'' sought by the one commenter, but also the ``uniformand consistent'' procedures sought by the other. It will not put any lawabiding permittees, operators or contract miners out of business, but willgive any permittee whose permit was improvidently issued a reasonable opportunityto bring about the correction of the defect in the permit and thus continuemining. The threat of alternative enforcement at a previous site with an unabatedviolation or a delinquent penalty or fee would not have an affect on operationsunder an improvidently issued permit. The potential rescission of an improvidentlyissued permit under this rule will give a permittee an incentive in additionto a cessation order or other enforcement action at a previous operationto bring about the abatement of a violation or the payment of a penaltyor fee resulting from that operation. One commenter said that the Congress provided an elaborate and detailedreview process by which any objection to a permit decision must be raised.Therefore, the commenter concluded, a presumption of validity accompaniesa regulatory authority's decision to issue a permit, and the only remedyfor an improvidently issued permit is an appeal under sections 514 and526 of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1264 and 1276, and their State program counter-parts.OSMRE disagrees that an appeal is the only lawful remedy. Section 514 ofthe Act, which gives certain persons a right to appeal a permit decision,neither limits the authority of OSMRE to adopt this rule nor the powerof State regulatory authorities over improvidently issued permits. Nordoes section 526 of the Act, which applies to judicial review of OSMREand State regulatory authority actions, place any limitation on the authorityof OSMRE or a State to adopt or implement the oversight and enforcementprocedures of this rule.a. <T3>Section 773.20(c)(1). </T3>Section 773.20(c)(1) gives a regulatoryauthority the alternative of implementing, with the cooperation of thepermittee or other person responsible, and of the responsible agency, aplan for abatement of the violation or a schedule for payment of the penaltyor fee on which the finding of improvident issuance was based. This sectionderives from later proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(1). The cooperation of the permittee or other person responsible, and of theresponsible agency, is necessary to insure the initial feasibility of andultimate compliance with any resulting plan or schedule. If the permitteeor other person responsible is unwilling to cooperate in implementing anabatement plan or payment schedule, the regulatory authority should useone of the other remedial measures. Any unwillingness on the part of the person responsible to cooperate withthe regulatory authority in this process should not be construed as a lackof ownership or control on the part of the permittee. Otherwise, personsresponsible might be induced to withhold cooperation as a means of demonstratingthe lack of an ownership or control link.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cooperation of Responsible Agency </ITAG>One commenter said that the lack of a reference to the responsible agencyin the provision of the later proposed rule corresponding to final andSection;773.20(c)(1) was inconsistent with later proposed andSection; 773.21(a)(3),which required compliance with an abatement plan or payment schedule tothe satisfaction of the responsible agency. The commenter asked whetherthis lack had any significance. The lack of an explicit reference to the responsible agency in later proposedandSection; 773.20(b)(1) was an oversight that was corrected in final andSection;773.20(c)(l). Where an agency other than the regulatory authority has jurisdictionover the unabated violation or delinquent penalty or fee, it is appropriatethat the regulatory authority implement any abatement plan or payment schedulewith the cooperation of that agency.b. <T3>Section 773.20(c)(2). </T3>Section 773.20(c)(2) gives a regulatoryauthority the alternative of imposing on an improvidently issued permita condition requiring that in a reasonable period of time the permitteeor other person responsible abate the violation or pay the penalty or feeon which the finding of improvident issuance was based. This section derivesfrom later proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(2). The final rule was revised to provide explicitly for a reasonable periodof time for abatement or payment. This was done because the permittee otherwisewould be in violation of the condition immediately after it was imposed.After this reasonable period of time, lack of compliance would subjectthe permittee to the enforcement measures of the regulatory program forthe violation of a permit condition.c. <T3>Section 773.20(c)(3). </T3>Section 773.20(c)(3) gives a regulatoryauthority the alternative of suspending an improvidently issued permituntil the underlying violation is abated or the delinquent penalty or feeis paid. This section derives from later proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(3). A suspension under andSection; 773.20(c)(3) will enable a regulatory authorityto terminate mining operations under a permit for an indefinite periodof time without subjecting the permittee to the possible financial, legalor other consequences that permit rescission might entail, such as defaulton financial or contractual agreements.Unlike andSection; 773.21 of this rule, andSection; 773.20(c)(3) does not setout specific suspension procedures. A regulatory authority which electsto suspend a permit under this section may use any appropriate proceduresthat are consistent with the regulatory program. Unless sound reasons existto the contrary, however, OSMRE anticipates that a suspension under thissection would at a minimum include a requirement that reclamation of thesite continue in a manner consistent with the anticipated duration of thesuspension, and provide for administrative appeal.<ITAG tagnum="81">Permit Suspension Procedures </ITAG>One commenter said that OSMRE should modify later proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(3)to allow the regulatory authority an appropriate period of time beforeinitiating permit suspension. The commenter said that permit suspensioncould be more onerous than rescission if it occurred immediately, withoutan opportunity for the permittee to correct the defect in the permit. OSMRE did not expressly adopt the commenter's suggestion. Section 773.20(c)(3)does not set out specific suspension procedures, but allows the regulatoryauthority to use any appropriate procedures that are consistent with theregulatory program, including a reasonable period of time between notifyinga permittee of a suspension and when the suspension becomes effective.The same commenter said that it was unclear whether the permit rescissionprocedures of andSection; 773.21 applied both to suspension under later proposedandSection; 773.20(b)(3), and to suspension and rescission under later proposedandSection; 773.20(b)(4). The commenter concluded that andSection; 773.21 appliedonly to rescission under andSection; 773.20(b)(4). The commenter is correct. As was proposed, final andSection; 773.21 appliesonly to permit suspension and rescission under andSection; 773.20(c)(4) ofthis rule. The suspension provision in andSection; 773.20(c)(3) was includedin the rule to give a regulatory authority discretion to tailor a suspensionto the unique circumstances involving a particular permit, and thus preventin appropriate cases such potentially onerous consequences as those towhich the commenter referred. To further clarify that andSection; 773.21 applies only to permit suspensionas a preliminary step in the permit rescission process, and not to suspensionunder andSection; 773.20(c)(3), the word <T3>suspension </T3>was deleted from the heading of andSection; 773.21. d. <T3>Section 773.20(c)(4). </T3>Section 773.20(c)(4) gives a regulatoryauthority the alternative of rescinding an improvidently issued permitunder andSection; 773.21 of this rule. This section derives from later proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(4). For moreon this remedial measure, see the immediately following discussion of andSection;773.21. C. Section 773.21_Improvidently Issued Permits: Rescission Procedures <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview </ITAG>Section 773.21 of this rule sets out the procedures a regulatory authoritymust use when it elects to rescind an improvidently issued permit. It requiresthe regulatory authority to serve on the permittee a notice of proposedsuspension and rescission which includes the reasons of the regulatoryauthority for its finding under andSection; 773.20(b) of this rule. In addition,the notice must state (1) when the proposed suspension and rescission willtake effect; (2) what proof the permittee must submit to forestall thesuspension and rescission; (3) the effect of the suspension and rescission;and (4) the applicable appeal procedures. This section derives from later proposed andSection; 773.21. To insure thatthe permittee receiving a notice of proposed suspension and rescissionis fully aware of its effect, this rule incorporates all of the requirementsof later proposed andSection; 773.21 into the notice itself. An explicit requirement for the regulatory authority to include in thenotice the reasons for its finding under andSection; 773.20(b) of this rule,which was implicit in later proposed andSection; 773.21(a)(1), was addedto this section to insure that the permittee is informed of the basis forthe finding. In serving a notice of proposed suspension and rescissionon a permittee, OSMRE intends that the regulatory authority will followthe procedures of 30 CFR 843.14, or the State program equivalent, for theservice of notices of violation, cessation orders, and show cause orders.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 773.21(a) Automatic Suspension and Rescission </ITAG>Section 773.21(a) requires a regulatory authority to state in a noticeof proposed suspension and rescission that after a specified period oftime not to exceed ninety days the permit automatically will be suspended,and not to exceed ninety days thereafter will be rescinded, unless withinthose periods the permittee demonstrates to the regulatory authority thatthe finding on which the notice was based was erroneous at the time itwas made, or that he or she subsequently has brought about the necessarycorrective action. The maximum ninety-day notice periods prior to the effect of suspensionand rescission derive from later proposed andSection; 773.20(a). Periodsshorter than ninety days may be set at the discretion of the regulatoryauthority as circumstances warrant, and the periods for suspension andrescission may have different durations. The notice period for permit rescission begins to run on the date a suspensionbecomes effective, so that under the rule the maximum notice period isone hundred and eighty days. The specified periods include Saturdays, Sundaysand holidays.These notice periods were adopted for several reasons. They will give thepermittee adequate time in appropriate cases to take corrective actionor to gather and submit the proof required to forestall the proposed suspensionand rescission. Such proof may not be readily available to the permitteeif the person responsible for the violation, penalty or fee is linked tothe permittee through a complex chain of ownership or control.In view of the potentially severe consequences which permit suspensionor rescission may have on the financial and contractual obligations, reputation,and employees of a permittee, and the diversity of circumstances underwhich a permit may be suspended or rescinded under this rule, it is reasonableto give the regulatory authority discretion to set appropriate periodsbefore the notice takes effect. The notice periods also will enable thepermittee to file an appeal as provided for by andSection; 773.21(c) of thisrule.The proof which the permittee must submit to forestall the suspension andrescission of the permit is either that (1) the finding of the regulatoryauthority under andSection; 773.20(b) of this rule was erroneous; (2) thepermittee or other person responsible has abated the violation on whichthe finding was based, or paid the delinquent penalty or fee, to the satisfactionof the responsible agency; (3) the unabated violation or delinquent penaltyor fee is the subject of a good faith appeal, or of an abatement plan orpayment schedule with which the permittee or other person responsible iscomplying to the satisfaction of the responsible agency; or (4) since thefinding was made the permittee has severed any ownership or control linkwith the person responsible for, and does not continue to be responsiblefor, the violation, penalty or fee.Under andSection; 773.21(a)(1) a permittee may submit proof concerning thestatus of the violation, penalty or fee at the time the finding was made,including any abatement, payment, appeal or abatement plan or payment scheduleoverlooked by the regulatory authority. Under andSection; 773.21(a) (2) and(3), the permittee may submit proof concerning any abatement, payment,appeal or abatement plan or payment schedule that arose after the findingwas made and the notice was issued.Likewise, under andSection; 773.21(a)(4) the permittee may submit proof thatthe applicable ownership or control link was severed after the notice ofproposed suspension and rescission was issued, and that the permittee doesnot continue to be responsible for the violation, penalty or fee. Thisprovision was added to make final andSection; 773.21(a) consistent with andSection;773.20(b)(3), which precludes a finding of improvident issuance under similarcircumstances.Thus, a permittee generally may forestall suspension or rescission undera notice of proposed suspension and rescission by using the waiting periodset by the regulatory authority to prove that the finding was erroneousor to remedy the defect in the permit. Again, from the standpoint of administrativeefficiency it is consistent with section 510(c) of the Act to afford thepermittee a reasonable period of time to submit this proof or correct thedefect in the permit, and thereby achieve a state of compliance that neitherwould have blocked the permit initially or have led to a finding of improvidentissuance under this rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">Ninety-Day Notice Periods</ITAG>Several commenters said that the proposed ninety-day notice periods priorto suspension and rescission under the rule were unjustified.OSMRE disagrees. Contrary to the commenters' interpretation, these periodsmay not exceed ninety days, but can be shorter, as circumstances warrant.As explained in the preceding discussion of andSection; 773.21(a), thesenotice periods were adopted to give the permittee adequate time in appropriatecases to gather and submit the proof required to forestall the proposedsuspension and rescission or take necessary corrective action, to accountfor the diversity of circumstances under which a permit may be suspendedor rescinded under this rule, and to enable the permittee to file an appealas provided for by andSection; 773.21(c) of this rule.Several commenters said that the rescission procedures of the initial proposedrule were onerous and uneven, and provided preferential treatment to apermittee who consciously violated section 510(c) of the Act, as comparedto one who in good faith provided all information on existing violations.Because the risk of agency error was small compared to the high degreeof risk to the public and the environment, these commenters said, the ruleshould not give a permittee any time to enter into an abatement plan orpayment schedule before a permit was rescinded, and that to do so wouldundercut compliance with section 510(c), encourage and reward fraud inpermit application preparation, and place the public and the environmentat risk.OSMRE disagrees. As explained in detail elsewhere in this preamble, fromthe standpoint of administrative efficiency, and considering the multiplepurposes of the Act, it is reasonable and appropriate to give a permitteea realistic period of time to bring his or her permit into compliance beforepermit suspension and rescission ultimately take effect.The tiered approach of permit suspension followed by rescission was adoptedto give the regulatory authority sufficient discretion to apply this remedialmeasure in a way that not only will fully protect the public and the environment,but also will reflect the underlying circumstances and the potential impactof these actions on the affected permittee.<ITAG tagnum="81">Proof Required to Negate Notice</ITAG>One commenter asked for examples of what would constitute satisfactoryproof that the finding of the regulatory authority was erroneous, or thatthe permittee or other person responsible had abated the violation or paidthe delinquent penalty or fee, or had entered into an abatement plan orpayment schedule.Because of the diversity of circumstances under which the rule will apply,it is not possible or appropriate to place strict limitations on what mightconstitute sufficient proof under andSection; 773.20(a). OSMRE intends thatthe regulatory authority will evaluate the sufficiency of the proof submittedby a permittee on a case-by-case basis.Generally, the proof should include a copy of some official written documentwhich confirms that the defect in the permit has been or is in the processof being corrected. It may include, for example, a termination notice issuedby a regulatory authority, indicating that the underlying violation hadbeen corrected; a cancelled check indicating payment of money owed; ora copy of a suitable abatement plan or payment schedule with accompanyingevidence of compliance.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 773.21(b) Cessation of Operations </ITAG>Section 773.21(b) requires a regulatory authority to state in a noticeof proposed suspension and rescission that after permit suspension or rescissionthe permittee shall cease all surface coal mining and reclamation operationsunder the permit, except for violation abatement and for reclamation andother environmental protection measures as required by the regulatory authority.This section derives from later proposed andSection; 773.21 (b). The phrase ``as required by the regulatory authority'' in this sectionrefers only to reclamation and other environmental protection measures,and not violation abatement, which is required in any case. This phrasewas substituted for the proposed phrase, ``required reclamation,'' to makeit clearer that the regulatory authority has discretion to make the reclamationrequirement consistent with any substantial likelihood that mining underthe permit will resume, and thus relieve the permittee, under appropriatecircumstances, from performing unproductive reclamation activities. The phrase, ``and other environmental protection measures,'' was addedto the final rule to enable a regulatory authority to account for environmentaleffects which may arise where mining has ceased, but complete reclamationhas not yet begun. Under such circumstances, the use of other protectionmeasures may be needed to reduce or prevent environmental impacts causedby the cessation of mining or deferral of complete reclamation. The additionof this phrase is consistent with the requirement of later proposed andSection;773.21(b) that the permittee perform ``required reclamation'' because thediscretion of the regulatory authority to defer complete reclamation necessarilyincludes discretion to impose measures needed to ensure that the exerciseof this discretion does not lead to additional environmental harm. The regulatory authority may specify in the notice itself any reclamationthat the permittee is required to perform, or subsequently may inform thepermittee regarding the reclamation requirement. This discretion is notintended to eliminate a reclamation requirement, but to allow temporarydeferral of certain reclamation activities under circumstances where theresumption of mining appears probable. <ITAG tagnum="81">Reclamation Responsibility After Permit Rescission </ITAG>Several commenters said that since a permit is issued to conduct not onlysurface coal mining operations, but also reclamation, permit rescissionterminates not only the right to mine, but also the right to reclaim. Thus,the commenters said, the requirement of the rule for a permittee to reclaimthe site following permit rescission was unfounded.OSMRE disagrees. As set out in section 102(e) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1202(e),it is a purpose of the Act to ``assure that adequate procedures are undertakento reclaim surface areas as contemporaneously as possible with * * * surfacecoal mining operations.'' In view of this purpose, OSMRE has a duty tointerpret the remainder of the Act in a manner that will bring about thesatisfactory completion of reclamation in situations where a permit isrescinded. Following their inclusion in a regulatory program, the environmental protectionperformance standards in section 515(b) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1265(b),including those for reclamation, apply to ``<T3>all </T3>surface coal mining and reclamation operations.'' (Emphasisadded.) Thus, the reclamation requirements apply whether an operation ispermitted or not. A permittee who disturbs a site as a result of operating under an improvidentlyissued permit incurs a reclamation obligation under the applicable regulatoryprogram, which terminates only upon satisfactory completion of reclamation.The rescinding of a permit does nothing to terminate or otherwise affectthis obligation to reclaim. Moreover, although section 506(a) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1256(a), requiresthat ``no person shall engage in * * * <T3>any surface coal mining operations </T3>unless such person has firstobtained a permit,'' this requirement for a permit is limited to surfacecoal mining operations, and does not extend to reclamation operations.(<T3>See Alabama By-Products Corp. and Drummond Coal Co., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>OSMRE, </T3>103 IBLA 264, 271 72 (1988), and <T3>Citizens for the Preservation of Knox County, </T3>81 IBLA 209, 218-219(1984), which conclude that a permanent program permit is not needed toreclaim a site that was mined under an interim program permit; <T3>and </T3>the OSMRE proposed rule at 53 FR 36404 (September 19, 1988)concerning the removal of requirements that an operator obtain or renewa permit when only reclamation activities must be performed.) Thus, it is consistent with the purpose set out in section 102(e) of theAct and the general authority provided by section 201(c)(2) of the Actfor OSMRE to establish procedures requiring reclamation in conformancewith the Act following permit rescission. <ITAG tagnum="81">Postponing Reclamation Requirement </ITAG>One commenter on the initial proposed rule said that where a permit isrescinded the operator should be given time to cure the defect in the permitbefore reclamation of all areas is required. OSMRE agrees with the commenter that after receiving a notice of proposedsuspension and rescission an operator should have a reasonable amount oftime to cure the defect in the permit before complete reclamation of allareas for which a reclamation obligation exists is required. Thus, finalandSection; 773.21 gives a permittee up to ninety days before a permit issuspended, and up to ninety days more until it is rescinded, in which tocure the defect in the permit. Following permit suspension or rescission, andSection; 773.21(b) requiresthe permittee to undertake reclamation and other environmental protectionmeasures as required by the regulatory authority. Depending on what thepermittee is doing to correct the defect in a <T3>suspended </T3>permit, this would enable the regulatory authority underappropriate circumstances to make reasonable adjustments in the requiredreclamation schedule. Following permit <T3>rescission, </T3>however, any delay in the commencement or continuationof complete reclamation would not be appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">Full Range of Enforcement Measures</ITAG> Initial proposed andSection; 773.20(b) provided for the issuance of a noticeof violation (NOV) to a permittee as an initial step in the permit rescissionprocess. Provision for this NOV was removed from the later proposed rule,and was not included in the permit rescission procedures of final andSection;773.21. One commenter asked whether the full range of enforcement measures wouldbe taken against a permittee issued an NOV under initial proposed andSection;773.20(b) if an outstanding violation at another site remained unabated.The commenter suggested that it would be inappropriate to do so since theunderlying violation requiring rescission of the permit was the resultof a failure to abate at a different operation, and presumably had beenpreviously subjected to the full range of alternative enforcement measures.OSMRE agrees in part, which is one reason why the procedures of the initialproposed rule were changed in the later proposed and final rules.The commenter is correct that a notice of proposed suspension and rescission,and any subsequent enforcement, would not directly apply to the reclamationof another site. For a violation at another site, alternative enforcementmeasures are governed by 30 CFR 723.15(b)(2) and 845.15(b)(2), not andSection;773.21.Once permit rescission becomes effective, however, the permittee no longerwill have the privilege of mining at the site for which the permit wasrescinded. If the permittee of the rescinded permit does not comply withthe requirement of andSection; 773.21(b) for the cessation of mining operationsand for reclamation and other environmental protection measures at thesite of the rescinded permit, then the full range of enforcement measures,including the issuance of a cessation order and the assessment of civilpenalties, may be taken against the permittee for mining without a validpermit.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 773.21(c) Right to Appeal</ITAG>Section 773.21(c) requires a regulatory authority to state in a noticeof proposed suspension and rescission the procedures by which the recipientmay file an appeal from the notice. This section derives from later proposedandSection; 773.21(c).Under this section, an appeal from a notice of proposed suspension andrescission may be filed by a permittee under 43 CFR 4.1280-4.l286, or theState program equivalent. The referenced andSection;andSection; 4.1280-4.1286generally apply to appeals from those decisions of the Director of OSMREfor which the Act does not require formal adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554.Under andSection; 773.21(c) the notice also must state that where OSMRE isthe regulatory authority the procedures of 43 CFR 4.21(a) shall not applyto suspend the effect of the notice. This precludes a suspension of thenotice both during the time when an appeal of the notice may be filed andwhile an appeal is pending.The alternative of allowing the filing of an appeal to stay the effectof the notice pending a decision could defeat the purpose of the noticeby enabling mining to proceed to completion. This provision makes the noticeeffective immediately when issued, and the maximum ninety-day periods beforean automatic suspension or rescission are not affected by the filing ofan appeal. Nothing in the rule will prevent the recipient of a notice ofproposed suspension and rescission from seeking a temporary stay as partof the normal administrative review process.In an appeal under andSection; 773.21(c), the review authority may allowany person responsible for the underlying violation, penalty or fee througha relationship of ownership or control to intervene. If the permittee doesnot appeal, but instead chooses another way to forestall suspension andrescission, such as severing the link to the responsible person, any otherperson may contest in the appropriate forum his or her responsibility forthe violation, penalty or fee if that opportunity was not previously provided.As discussed in the ownership and control rule at 53 FR 38879, questionsinvolving a Federal violation, penalty or fee must be resolved in a Federalforum, and both individuals and organizations may seek to amend incorrectinformation in the Applicant/ Violator System.<ITAG tagnum="81">Scope of Appeal</ITAG> Several commenters on the initial proposed rule said that an appeal ofpermit rescission should only concern whether the permittee or other personresponsible in fact had been cited for the violation on which rescissionwas based, and not whether the citation itself was lawful, which shouldhave been contested in a separate and timely appeal proceeding followingissuance of the violation notice.OSMRE agrees that an appeal from a notice of proposed suspension and rescissionis not the proper forum for direct appeal of the underlying violation,penalty or fee when an earlier opportunity was provided. Generally, however,a permittee should be allowed to contest the basis for the notice. Whetherany particular issue can be relitigated in a particular case will dependon the accepted legal principles of <T3>res judicata </T3>and collateral estoppel.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cessation of Operations Pending Appeal</ITAG> One commenter objected to later proposed andSection; 773.21 (b) and (c)to the extent they required a permittee to cease operations pending anappeal of a notice of proposed suspension and rescission. The commentersaid that since the violation would not have occurred under the permitthat was subject to suspension or rescission, operations under that permitshould not have to cease, and that when the Congress addressed permit suspensionfor a pattern of violations in section 521(a)(4) of the Act it providedfor a hearing prior to the suspension.Likewise, the commenter said, under section 521(a)(5) of the Act a cessationorder expires if a hearing is not held within thirty days of actual noticeto the operator. By not affording a hearing prior to suspension or rescission,the commenter concluded, the rule was contrary to the explicit provisionsof the Act, as well as the guarantee of due process under the Fifth Amendmentto the Constitution. OSMRE disagrees. The commenter's objection concerns the provision in laterproposed and final andSection; 773.21(b) that requires the permittee to ceaseoperations after permit suspension or rescission becomes effective, andthe provision in later proposed and final andSection; 773.21(c) that makes43 CFR 4.21(a) inapplicable to a notice of proposed suspension and rescission.Absent that later provision, under andSection; 4.21(a) the notice would notbe effective during the time in which a person adversely affected mightfile an appeal, and the filing of an appeal would suspend the effect ofthe notice pending the decision on appeal, so the permittee could continuemining. Contrary to the commenter's assertion, a notice of proposed suspensionand rescission under andSection; 773.21 is based not only on a previous violation,penalty or fee, but also on a violation associated with the permit in question_namely,operating under an improvidently issued permit. And andSection; 4.21(a) expresslyprovides for exceptions to its provisions through other regulations suchas this rule. Since operations under an improvidently issued permit should not have commencedin the first place, it is appropriate to impose reasonable restrictionson how long they may continue after a notice of proposed suspension andrescission is issued. If andSection; 4.21(a) applied, a permittee who appealeda notice could continue to mine until the appeal was decided, regardlessof the consequences to the public and the environment. Rather than risk the potentially harmful results that could ensue underan automatic stay under andSection; 4.21(a), the rule gives the regulatoryauthority discretion to adopt, on a case-by-case basis, notice periodsas long as ninety days before suspension and rescission take effect, oran overall maximum of one hundred and eighty days. This will enable theregulatory authority to reasonably balance the rights of the permitteeagainst the need to protect society and the environment from potentialadverse consequences. Moreover, it will add to the incentive provided bythe rule for the permittee to bring about abatement or payment of the violation,penalty or fee on which the notice is based. As the commenter pointed out, section 521(a)(4) of the Act and the implementingregulations at 30 CFR 843.13 allow a permittee to request a public hearingbefore a suspension under their provisions becomes effective. Correspondingprovisions in section 521(b) of the Act, however, only require the Secretaryto give the permittee a reasonable time to conform ongoing operations tothe requirements of the Act before suspending or revoking a State permit.Thus, the Congress did not intend that the procedures in section 521(a)(4)pertaining to a pattern of violations would apply in all circumstances,and this rule legitimately may employ other appropriate procedures. Theprocedures governing cessation orders in section 521(a)(5) of the Act arelimited to that specific context and do not apply to this rule. Subject only to the limitation that the procedures of 43 CFR 4.21(a) donot apply where OSMRE is the regulatory authority, the rule affords a permitteea reasonable right to file an appeal for administrative review of a noticeof proposed suspension and rescission, and does not preclude the grantingof a temporary stay of the notice. This is fully consistent with the guaranteeof due process under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. D. Section 843.13 Suspension or Revocation of Permits: Pattern of ViolationsThis rule revises the heading of existing andSection; 843.13, which governsthe suspension and revocation of a surface coal mining and reclamationpermit for a pattern of violations occurring under that permit. The revisionadds at the end of the heading the phrase, ``Pattern of violations.'' The expanded heading will help to differentiate andSection; 843.13 from newandSection; 773.21, which governs permits that were improvidently issuedas a result of an unabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee atanother operation prior to the time of permit issuance.  No comments were received on this revision, which is adopted as proposed.E. Section 843.21 Procedures for Improvidently Issued State Permits <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview </ITAG>A State regulatory authority in some instances may not take the actionrequired by andSection; 773.20 of this rule, or the State program equivalent,with respect to an improvidently issued permit. This may result from alack of equivalent regulations in the State program, or from other causes.OSMRE is adding to the existing Federal enforcement procedures in 30 CFRPart 843 a new andSection; 843.21 to provide a mechanism for Federal enforcementin these situations. Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of andSection;843.21 derive from the correspondingly numbered paragraphs of later proposedandSection; 843.21. If OSMRE has reason to believe that a State surface coal mining and reclamationpermit meets the criteria of this rule, or the State program equivalent,for an improvidently issued permit, andSection; 843.21 requires OSMRE toissue to the State an initial notice of that belief, requires the Stateto respond within a specified period of time, and where the State responseis inadequate requires OSMRE to issue to the State a ten-day notice. If the State does not take appropriate action under the ten-day notice,or show good cause for not doing so, the rule requires OSMRE to take appropriateremedial action, which may include the issuance of a notice of violation(NOV). Where an NOV is issued, the rule allows any person to submit informationwhich may lead OSMRE to either vacate or terminate the NOV. Finally, therule prohibits OSMRE from assessing a civil penalty for such an NOV. <ITAG tagnum="81"> Jurisdictional Considerations </ITAG>One commenter said that the initial proposed rule gave the clear implicationthat it would be used to make the operator the pawn in a chess match betweenOSMRE and any State which failed to enforce its regulatory program. Thecommenter was concerned that the rule would enable OSMRE to impose on anoperator requirements  a State was unwilling to impose, which might resultin a domino effect leading to the rescission of permits for other operationsowned or controlled by that operator. OSMRE disagrees that the rule involves any considerations other than legitimateoversight and enforcement of State regulatory programs under the Act. Section 510(c) of the Act. imposes on an applicant an affirmative obligationto list all notices of violations of the Act and other specified environmentallaws and regulations, and requires a regulatory authority to withhold apermit in appropriate circumstances. As revised on October 3, 1988 (53FR 37165), 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) requires a regulatory authority to withholda permit if any operation owned or controlled by either the applicant orby any person who owns or controls the applicant currently is subject tocertain unabated violations or delinquent penalties or fees. This rule requires no more than does section 510(c) and 30 CFR 773.15.A permittee who obtains a permit in contravention of these requirementshas no cause to complain that rescission of the permit makes it a pawnin any disagreement that may lie between OSMRE and the issuing State. Wherethe State should not have issued the permit in the first place, the remedialmeasures of this rule merely seek to place the permittee in its lawfulstatus.One commenter, who suggested a previously discussed alternative to andSection;andSection;773.20 and 773.21 of this rule based on an order to show cause, said thatunder the alternative no need would exist for proposed andSection; 843.21because adequate remedies existed under the Act for OSMRE to contest individualpermits or to supersede the State permitting process. The commenter specificallyreferenced sections 513(b), 514(c), 521(b) and 526(e) of the Act, 30 U.S.C.1263(b), 1264(c), 1271(b) and 1276(e).OSMRE disagrees. This rule does not supersede the State permitting process.Neither the suggested alternative nor the cited provisions of the Act minimizethe need for this rule, which will provide OSMRE and the States with specificprocedures for dealing with improvidently issued permits. The Congressin enacting section 201(c)(2) of the Act recognized the need for OSMREto ``publish and promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessaryto carry out [its] purposes and provisions,'' and this rule is a necessaryand legitimate exercise of that rulemaking authority.<ITAG tagnum="81">AVS Memorandum of Understanding</ITAG>One commenter said that initial proposed andSection; 843.21 conflicted witha memorandum of understanding (MOU) between State regulatory authoritiesand OSMRE concerning the implementation of the Applicant/Violator System.The commenter said that under the MOU, until all necessary State and Federalrule changes have taken place a State is required only to enforce its existingstatutes and regulations. If State law prohibited permit rescission, thecommenter concluded, it was not appropriate for OSMRE to rescind a Statepermit. OSMRE disagrees that this rule conflicts with the MOU. Section 773.20of the rule applies to the violations review criteria of the regulatoryprogram in force at the time a permit was issued. Section 843.21, whichreferences andSection; 773.20, also applies to the criteria in force at thetime of permit issuance. Neither section requires a regulatory authorityto take any action that is inconsistent with its existing regulatory program.While each primacy State, in due course, must adopt regulations consistentwith this rule, the MOU was not intended to preclude the amendment of Stateprograms. Prior to the adoption of consistent regulations by a State, therule will give OSMRE necessary enforcement power to take appropriate remedialaction on an improvidently issued State permit. Such remedial action doesnot include suspension or rescission of a State permit.<ITAG tagnum="81">Extensions of Time</ITAG>One commenter asked if the maximum ninety-day extension of time affordedby initial proposed andSection; 773.20(b)(2) and (b)(3) also applied to theprocedures under andSection; 843.21. As neither final andSection; 773.20 nor andSection; 773.21 any longer providefor an extension of time, this comment is moot. Where an NOV is issuedunder andSection; 843.21, the deadlines normally associated with an NOV willapply.<ITAG tagnum="81">Ownership and Control Relationships Covered</ITAG>One commenter said that initial proposed andSection; 843.21 failed to fullyaccount for relationships of ownership or control, and that andSection; 843.21(c),(c)(2) and (c)(3) should be revised to cover any person responsible foran unabated violation or a delinquent penalty or fee.OSMRE agrees and has added the phrase, ``other person responsible,'' tothis and the later proposed rules where appropriate to cover a relationshipof ownership or control.<ITAG tagnum="81">Review of State Section 510(c) Findings </ITAG>One commenter asked if OSMRE intended to review all State section 510(c)findings on a day-to-day basis.OSMRE does not intend to review all section 510(c) findings made by Stateregulatory authorities, but may sample them in a random manner as partof its oversight role. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 843.21(a) Initial Notice</ITAG>As the first step in the Federal enforcement of an improvidently issuedState permit, andSection; 843.21(a) requires OSMRE to issue to the Statean initial notice. The notice must state in writing the reasons why OSMREhas reason to believe that a State surface coal mining and reclamationpermit meets the criteria for an improvidently issued permit in andSection;773.20(b) of this rule, or the State program equivalent, and that the Statemust take appropriate action on the permit under State program equivalentsof andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 773.21 of this rule.Although andSection; 843.21(a) refers to the State program equivalents ofboth andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 773.21, as do the subsequent provisionsof andSection; 843.21, action by a State under the equivalent to andSection;773.21 is discretionary. Reference to both sections is included for completenessbecause under andSection; 773.20(c)(4) one of the appropriate actions a Statemay take against an improvidently issued permit is rescission, which ifelected must occur under the State program equivalent to andSection; 773.21.This notice is called an ``initial notice'' to differentiate it from aten-day notice issued under subsequently discussed andSection; 843.21(c)of this rule. The rule also encourages, but does not require, OSMRE toprovide to the permittee a copy of the notice. This discretion was includedin the rule to forestall the possibility of invalidating any subsequentenforcement steps taken under this section due to an inadvertent lack ofinitial notice to the permittee.Since the initial notice primarily is concerned with State compliance,and since the vacation and termination procedures in subsequently discussedandSection; 843.2l(e) provide ample relief to a permittee in the event ofan error, a permittee who fails to receive the initial notice should notsuffer any significant hardship. OSMRE will mail, or otherwise deliver,a copy of the initial notice to the permittee at his or her last knownaddress.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mandatory Ten-Day Notice</ITAG>Several commenters on the later proposed rule said, without further explanation,that OSMRE was obligated to take enforcement action within ten days afternotifying a State that a permit was improvidently issued, and nothing wouldconstitute ``good cause'' for the State not taking action to suspend thepermit. Several commenters said that the initial proposed rule illegallyconverted the ten day notice under section 521 of the Act into a forty-plusday notice. These commenters said that there was no legal or practicaljustification for extending the period for State response beyond ten days.OSMRE disagrees. Section 521(a)(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1271(a)(1), whichapplies to ``any * * * violation of any requirement of [the] Act or anypermit condition required by the Act,'' does require OSMRE to issue a noticeto the applicable State regulatory authority, for which the State has tendays to respond. (For the OSMRE interpretation of the requirements of section521(a), see the July 14, 1988 OSMRE final rule at 53 FR 26742, which thispreamble incorporates by reference.) Section 521(b) of the Act, however,which applies to a deficiency in State enforcement of all or any part ofan approved State program, requires OSMRE to give a State thirty days'notice before holding a public hearing. Since a State's lack of appropriate action on an improvidently issued permitmay involve both a potential deficiency in State enforcement of its regulatoryprogram, as well as an individual violation of the Act, it is reasonablefor this rule to employ a tiered notice approach which reflects the goalsand timing of both sections 521(a)(1) and 521(b). The authority for thisregulatory approach, which is consistent with paragraph No. 3 of the RevisedParker Order, is set out under the subsequent heading, II.F.1. StatutoryAuthority.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 843.21(b) State Response</ITAG>Section 843.21(b) gives a State thirty days to respond to an initial noticeissued under andSection; 843.21(a) of this rule concerning a potential improvidentlyissued permit. To forestall further proceedings under this section, theState must demonstrate to OSMRE in writing either that (1) the permit doesnot meet the criteria of andSection; 773.20(b) of this rule, or the Stateprogram equivalent, for an improvidently issued permit; or (2) that theState is in compliance with the State program equivalents of andSection;andSection;773.20 and 773.21 of this rule. As is explicitly provided in subsequently discussed andSection; 843.21(d),a State cannot meet this requirement by demonstrating that the State programlacks equivalents to andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 773.21. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 843.21(c) Ten-Day Notice </ITAG>If OSMRE finds that a State has not made the demonstration required byandSection; 843.21(b) of this rule, andSection; 843.21(c) requires OSMRE toissue to the State a ten-day notice stating in writing the reasons forthat finding and requesting that within ten days the State take appropriateaction under the State program equivalents of andSection;andSection; 773.20and 773.21 of this rule. This section does not impose any time limit on when OSMRE may make therequired finding. OSMRE may make this finding prior to expiration of thethirty-day response period of andSection; 843.21(b) where the State inadequatelyhas attempted to make the required demonstration. If a State does not respond,however, OSMRE will not issue a ten-day notice until after the thirty-dayresponse period of andSection; 843.21(b) has expired.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Section 843.21(d) Federal Enforcement </ITAG>Section 843.21(d) requires OSMRE to take appropriate remedial action ifafter ten days a State which is issued a ten-day notice does not take appropriateaction under the State program equivalents of andSection;andSection; 773.20and 773.21 of this rule, or show good cause for its inaction. Under thissection, good cause does not include the lack of State program equivalentsof andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 773.21. For OSMRE to find that a State is taking appropriate remedial action underthis section, the State need not have completed the processing of an improvidentlyissued permit under the State program equivalents of andSection;andSection;773.20 and 773.21. As long as the State has begun a process as effectiveas that of andSection; 773.20, and is making reasonable progress toward imposingand enforcing any appropriate remedial measures, the State is taking appropriateaction.Appropriate remedial action by OSMRE under andSection; 843.21(d) may include,but is not limited to, the issuance of a notice of violation (NOV) requiringthat by a specified date all mining operations shall cease and reclamationof all areas for which a reclamation obligation exists shall commence orcontinue unless, to the satisfaction of the responsible agency, any violation,penalty or fee on which the notice of violation was based is abated orpaid, or an abatement plan or payment schedule is entered into, or anyownership or control link with the person responsible is severed and thepermittee does not continue to be responsible for the violation, penaltyor fee. Provision for allowing the permittee to sever his or her link with theperson responsible as a way to forestall an NOV if the permittee does notcontinue to be responsible for the violation, penalty or fee, was addedto make andSection; 843.21(d) consistent with andSection; 773.20(b)(3), whichprecludes a finding of improvident issuance under similar circumstances.As previously discussed, for purposes of section 510(c) of the Act severingthe link to the person responsible should have the same effect regardlessof when it occurs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Reclamation Requirement </ITAG>One commenter objected to the requirement of initial proposed andSection;843.21(b)(2) for the commencement or continuation of reclamation for allareas for which a reclamation obligation existed. The commenter said thatthe mere interruption of mining would be sufficient to induce compliance,and that it was unnecessarily harsh to require termination of the operationwhen interruption would achieve the desired result. Where a notice of violation was issued under andSection; 843.21, the commenterconcluded, the permittee only should be required to meet contemporaneousreclamation requirements, but complete reclamation, such as backfillingthe pit, removal or roads and sedimentation ponds, and dismantling of buildingsand other structures, should not be required. OSMRE disagrees in part. To the extent the commenter's concern is basedon the requirement of initial proposed andSection; 843.21(b) for the immediatecessation of mining and the commencement or continuation of reclamationupon issuance of a notice of violation (NOV) under that section, laterproposed and final andSection; 843.21(d) were revised to temper this excessivelystringent requirement. Section 843.21(d) now allows OSMRE to postpone thisrequirement for ``a specified time'' following issuance of the NOV in orderto give the permittee time to abate the violation. While a notice of violation issued under andSection; 843.21(d) must includea requirement that complete reclamation commence or continue after a specifieddate, prior to that date the permittee may continue mining. Thus, the permitteewill have notice of, and an opportunity to correct, the defect in the permitbefore mining is either interrupted or terminated. Only after this reasonableperiod for abatement expires must mining cease and reclamation commenceor continue. If a substantial likelihood arises that the permittee will be able to correctthe defect in the permit after the specified date, although mining mustcease OSMRE may amend the reclamation requirement in the NOV to reflectthis development. After the permittee has demonstrated an unwillingnessor an inability to correct the defect in the permit, however, completereclamation is in order. Where an NOV is issued under andSection; 843.21(d) and the permittee or otherperson responsible has failed to remedy the defect in the permit, a mereinterruption of the mining operation would be insufficient to compel compliance.Thus, a requirement to commence reclamation is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cessation of Mining </ITAG>One commenter said that OSMRE lacks authority to require the immediatecessation of mining, as required by initial proposed andSection; 843.21,in the absence of an inspection which results in a finding of a violationcausing ``an imminent danger to the health and safety of the environment''or actual or potential ``significant, imminent environmental harm to land,air, or water resources.''  OSMRE disagrees. The circumstances quoted by the commenter, which are setout in section 521(a)(2) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1271(a)(2), govern the issuanceof an imminent harm cessation order (CO). Under 30 CFR 843.11(a)(2) operating``without a valid surface coal mining permit constitutes a condition orpractice which can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminentenvironmental harm to land, air or water resources * * *.'' Thus, OSMREhas the authority to issue an imminent harm CO to a permittee operatingunder such circumstances. Nevertheless, initial proposed andSection; 843.21 did not require, and thisrule does not provide for the issuance of an imminent harm CO, but insteadan NOV requiring the cessation of mining. And rather than requiring thecessation of mining immediately upon issuance of the NOV, as would havebeen required by the initial proposed rule, final andSection; 843.21 requiresthe cessation of mining if by a specified date after the issuance of anNOV the underlying violation, penalty or fee is not abated or paid to thesatisfaction of the responsible agency. Thus, a reasonable abatement periodis provided. Although an imminent harm CO and an NOV requiring the cessation of miningare similar in that both would require the cessation of mining, they differin that they are based on different authority in the Act and are subjectto different procedures with different consequences. For example, undersection 518(a) of the Act and 30 CFR 845.12 a penalty for a CO is mandatory,but for an NOV may be discretionary. As provided in andSection; 843.21(f)of this rule, no civil penalty will be assessed for an NOV issued underandSection; 843.21. Under section 521(a)(3) of the Act an NOV must require the permittee toabate the violation on which it is based. For the violation of operatingunder an improvidently issued permit, abatement may consist of either correctingthe deficiency in the permit or ceasing operations. To account for the alternative of abatement through correction of the deficiencyin the permit, andSection; 843.21 of this rule requires the cessation ofmining only if the permittee does not correct the deficiency within a specifiedtime. If the permittee does not cease mining as required under the NOV,OSMRE will issue a failure-to-abate cessation order with all of the associatedconsequences.<ITAG tagnum="81">OSMRE Discretion </ITAG>Several commenters said the discretion afforded to OSMRE by later proposedandSection; 843.21(d) for the issuance of an NOV was inconsistent with enforcementactions under the regulatory program. OSMRE disagrees. As explained in detail elsewhere in this preamble, thepotential of this rule for causing economic disruption and hardship asa result of OSMRE action on an improvidently issued permit, as well asadministrative considerations involved in the oversight and enforcementof a State permit, necessitate that OSMRE have reasonable discretion inimposing an appropriate remedy. As long as the purposes of the regulatoryprogram are not compromised, it is reasonable for OSMRE to retain sufficientdiscretion to account for the overall effect of its action. <ITAG tagnum="81">Meaning of ``Good Cause'' </ITAG>One commenter on the initial proposed rule asked what OSMRE would considergood cause for a lack of State action under andSection; 843.21(d). Under the rule, good cause may consist of any reasonable factual or legalimpediment to taking action under State program equivalents of andSection;andSection;773.20 and 773.21. As previously noted, however, good cause under andSection;843.21 does not include the lack of State program equivalents to andSection;andSection;773.20 and 773.21. For additional discussion of the types of circumstanceswhich may constitute good cause under this rule, see the July 14, 1988,OSMRE final rule at 53 FR 26728. Another commenter said that later proposed andSection; 843.21(d) was inherentlyinconsistent in requiring OSMRE to determine whether a State had takenappropriate action under the State program equivalent of andSection; 773.20,or had shown good cause for not doing so, while also providing that goodcause does not include the lack of a State program equivalent to andSection;773.20. The commenter asked how a State could be considered as not showinggood cause when it was not authorized to take such action. Good cause does not include the lack of State program equivalents to andSection;andSection;773.20 and 773.21 because even without such specific procedures each primacyState has the power to correct errors and take remedial action on an improvidentlyissued State permit. Any other approach might give a State an incentiveto delay the adoption of equivalent procedures, and thus decrease the effectivenessof this rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Modification of Revised Parker Order Procedures </ITAG>Several commenters said that under the Revised Parker Order if a Statedoes not initiate permit rescission proceedings OSMRE must issue an NOVto cause the operation to cease until all violations are abated or penaltiespaid. Later proposed andSection; 843.21, the commenters said, would amendthe clear action required by the Revised Parker Order, and allow the Stateto take ``appropriate action'' or show good cause why it did not do so.Referencing previous comments on the ten day notice rule and related litigation,the commenters concluded that the proposal was illegal. OSMRE disagrees. Like andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 773.21 of this rule,andSection; 843.21 will facilitate compliance with the Act in a manner whichis not unduly restrictive and which recognizes that different circumstancesmay necessitate different remedies. While this rule to a certain extentmodifies the procedures of the Revised Parker Order, in many instancesit will not interfere with the action specified by paragraph no. 3 of theorder. To the extent the rule modifies the procedures set out in paragraph no.3 of the Revised Parker Order, it is authorized by paragraph no. 31 ofthe order, which provides that<ITAG tagnum="20">[n]othing in this Order shall in any fashion limit or otherwise interferewith the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to * * * revise, amend,or promulgate new regulations under the * * * Act. Once effective, suchregulations shall apply to this Order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">6. Section 843.21(e) Remedies to Notice of Violation </ITAG>Upon receipt from any person of information concerning the issuance ofa notice of violation (NOV) under andSection; 843.21(d) of this rule, andSection;843.21(e) requires OSMRE to review the information and either vacate orterminate the NOV in appropriate circumstances. Vacation of an NOV issued under andSection; 843.21(d) is required if theNOV resulted from an erroneous conclusion regarding the issuance of thepermit. Termination of an NOV issued under andSection; 843.21(d) is required if (i)the permittee or other person responsible subsequently has, to the satisfactionof the responsible agency, abated any violation or paid any penalty orfee on which the notice of violation was based; (ii) the permittee or otherperson responsible has filed and is pursuing a good faith appeal of theunderlying violation, penalty or fee, or has entered into and is complyingwith an abatement plan or payment schedule to the satisfaction of the responsibleagency; or (iii) subsequent to issuance of the NOV the permittee seversany ownership or control link with the person responsible for, and doesnot continue to be responsible for, the underlying violation, penalty orfee. Provision for allowing any person to demonstrate that the permittee hassevered his or her link with the person responsible for the violation,penalty or fee as a way to terminate an NOV issued under this rule wherethe permittee does not continue to be responsible for the violation, penaltyor fee was added to make andSection; 843.21(e)(2) consistent with andSection;773.20(b)(3), which precludes a finding of improvident issuance under similarcircumstances. As previously discussed, for purposes of section 510(c)of the Act severing the link to the person responsible should have thesame effect regardless of when it occurs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incorrect Terminology </ITAG>One commenter said that the preamble to the initial proposed rule (51 FR25827) incorrectly stated that OSMRE ``could'' vacate or terminate a noticeof violation issued under andSection; 843.21(c)(1)-(3) for specified reasons,when it should have said ``shall,'' since vacation or termination was mandatory.OSMRE agrees, and that is the correct interpretation of the word <T3>shall </T3>in final andSection; 843.21(e). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Section 843.21(f) No Civil Penalty </ITAG>Section 843.21(f) bars OSMRE from assessing a civil penalty for an NOVissued under andSection; 843.21(d). If the permittee does not cease miningor otherwise comply by the specified date, however, OSMRE will issue afailure-to-abate cessation order (FTACO) with all of the associated consequences,including any appropriate penalty, and may use other alternative enforcementmeasures available under the Act.OSMRE has adopted this provision because as a matter of policy it concludesthat any penalty should derive directly from the underlying violation,penalty or fee, and not indirectly through an NOV issued to remedy an improvidentlyissued permit. This is consistent with section 518(a) of the Act, whichdoes not require a penalty for every NOV, because a penalty would havebeen assessed where appropriate on the underlying violation. If an FTACO is issued, however, OSMRE concludes that the failure of thepermittee to comply with the NOV constitutes independent justificationfor any resulting penalty.<ITAG tagnum="81">Commenter Support for Similar Provision </ITAG>One commenter on initial proposed andSection; 773.20 said that since permitrescission was not necessarily the permittee's fault, a penalty shouldnot be assessed for an NOV under that section. Another commenter said thatan order for the cessation of operations and reclamation following permitrescission should not lead to additional penalties if complied with bythe permittee.While andSection; 773.20 of this rule no longer provides for an NOV, theissues raised by these commenters also apply to the prohibition of a penaltyunder andSection; 843.21(f). OSMRE agrees with these commenters, and hasrevised the later proposed and final rules accordingly.F. Statutory Authority and General Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statutory Authority</ITAG>A number of commenters on the proposed rule said that the Act did not authorizethe rescission of an improvidently issued permit or the promulgation ofregulations for that purpose. Other commenters said that the Act providedsuch authority.OSMRE concludes that it has the necessary statutory authority to suspendor rescind an improvidently issued permit where it is the regulatory authority,to take oversight and enforcement action on an improvidently State permit,and for this rule in general.As noted in the preamble to the initial proposed rule (52 FR 25823), sections201(c)(2) and 412(a) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1211(c)(2) and 1242(a), conferupon OSMRE broad rulemaking authority. Moreover, section 201(c)(1) of theAct, 30 U.S.C. 1211(c)(1), authorizes OSMRE to ``order the <T3>suspension</T3>, <T3>revocation</T3>, or <T3>withholding </T3>of any permit for failure to comply with any of theprovisions of this Act or any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.'' (Emphasis added.)Sections 201(c) and 510(c) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1211(c) and 1260(c), authorizea regulatory authority to withhold a permit from any applicant who eitherdirectly, indirectly or through a relationship of ownership or controlis in violation of the Act or certain other environmental laws. The Congresscould not have intended that OSMRE and State regulatory authorities wouldwithhold a permit in accordance with these provisions from an applicantresponsible for or linked to an unabated violation or delinquent penaltyor fee, but do nothing to remedy a permit that was improvidently issued.Since section 201(c)(1) covers a failure to comply with any of the provisionsof the Act or its implementing regulations, it authorizes the suspension,rescission or taking of other remedial measures against a permit for afailure to comply with the permit withholding requirements of 30 CFR 773.15,or the State program equivalent. Moreover, the underlying failure to abatea violation or to pay a civil penalty or reclamation fee when due alsois a ``failure to comply'' within the purview of this section of the Act.As stated by the Act in section 102(a), 30 U.S.C. 1202(a), the Act waspassed ``to protect society and the environment from the adverse effectsof surface coal mining operations.'' As one means to achieve this protection,the Act denies certain persons the privilege of mining. Where through fraud,mistake or otherwise, such a person improvidently is issued a permit, theregulatory authority is required by the Act to protect society and theenvironment by taking appropriate measures to bring the permittee intocompliance. The remedial measures of this rule, with the ultimate sanctionsof permit suspension and rescission, will provide an incentive for thepermittee or other person responsible to abate any violation or pay anydelinquent penalty or fee which should have caused the regulatory authorityto withhold the permit.Authority for this rule also is provided by sections 101, 412(a), 501(b),504, 506, 507, 511, 518 and 701 of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1201, 1242(a), 1251(b),1254, 1256, 1257, 1261, 1268 and 1291.<ITAG tagnum="81">General Authority</ITAG>One commenter said that section 201(c)(1) of the Act does not provide generalauthority for permit suspension and revocation, but only under the circumstancesset out in the specific implementing provisions of the Act. For each delegationof authority in section 201(c), the commenter said, the Act included aspecific provision governing the circumstances and manner under which OSMREmay exercise that authority. Thus, the commenter concluded, the authorityto order the suspension or revocation of a permit under section 201(c)(1)applied only to suspension or revocation under section 521(a)(4) of theAct for a pattern of violations.OSMRE disagrees. There is nothing in the Act or its legislative historyto support the commenter's constrained reading of section 201(c)(1).If the Congress had intended to give section 201(c)(1) the limited scopesuggested by the commenter, it would not have drafted that section as itdid in far broader terms than section 521(a)(4). Section 201(c)(1) authorizesthe revocation of a permit generally for a ``failure to comply with anyof the provisions of this Act or any rules and regulations adopted pursuantthereto.'' Section 521(a)(4) addresses only the limited circumstances wherethere exists a pattern of violations caused by the permittee, either willfullyor by an unwarranted failure to comply with the Act. Since the Congressused broader language in section 201(c)(1) than it did in section 521(a)(4),OSMRE concludes that the Congress intended to give section 201(c)(1) broaderscope.Contrary to the commenter's analysis, section 201(c) is not a mere summaryof the subsequent detailed provisions of the Act, but an independent mandatefor OSMRE to take the specified actions in appropriate circumstances. Section201(c)(1), like the general authority for promulgating regulations in section201(c)(2), is prefaced by the statement, ``The Secretary, acting through[OSMRE], shall * * * .'' (Emphasis added.) This use of the word <T3>shall </T3>gives section 201 independent force and effect which isnot subservient to any other provision of the Act. If the Congress had intended section 201(c) as a summary of other specificprovisions, it would have introduced section 201(c) with descriptive languagemore like that used to set out the purposes of the Act in section 102.Since the Congress did not do so, however, but instead chose to use theterm <T3>shall, </T3>OSMRE concludes that the Congress intended section 201(c)(1)as general authority for permit suspension and rescission for a failureto comply with the Act or its implementing regulations.This conclusion regarding the scope of section 201(c)(1) is consistentwith the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit in <T3>In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation </T3>(<T3>In re: Permanent</T3>), 653 F.2d 514 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 454 U.S. 822 (1981). There the court examined theauthority of the Secretary of the Interior to require a permit applicantto submit information not specifically identified in section 507(b) ofthe Act, 30 U.S.C. 1257(b). In analysing the authority provided to theSecretary by section 201(c)(2) of the Act, the court said:<ITAG tagnum="21">Appellant urges as a proposition of administrative law that the existenceof specific grants must eviscerate a general grant of rulemaking power.That proposition cannot be squared with recent Supreme Court decisionsrelying on general rulemaking grants to uphold rulemaking authority despitethe presence of specific grants in the statutes scrutinized.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id. </T3>at 523 (citations omitted). In view of the general rulemakingauthority provided by section 201(c)(2), the court held that<ITAG tagnum="21">The Act's explicit listings of information required of permit applicantsare not exhaustive, and do not preclude the Secretary from requiring thestates to secure additional information needed to insure compliance withthe Act.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id. </T3>at 527. Thus, OSMRE may rely on section 201(c)(1) and thebroad rulemaking authority provided by section 201(c)(2) to provide forthe rescission of an improvidently issued permit under circumstances notspecifically set out in the Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">Notice of Violation </ITAG>Initial proposed andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 843.21 included a noticeof violation (NOV) as a preliminary step in the permit rescission process.In this final rule, as in the later proposed rule, an NOV is included onlyin andSection; 843.2l, which authorizes OSMRE to issue a Federal NOV to aState permittee if the State does not take appropriate action on an improvidentlyissued permit or show good cause for its lack of action. Provision for the issuance of an NOV was deleted from andSection; 773.20because it is not needed where the regulatory authority can directly imposeon a permittee the alternative remedial measures of andSection; 773.20(c).Where OSMRE is enforcing an improvidently issued State permit under andSection;843.21, however, it cannot directly impose these remedial measures andan NOV is needed if the State does not take appropriate action or showgood cause for not doing so. Since OSMRE will not have issued the Statepermit, and thus cannot rescind it or impose the other remedial measuresof andSection; 773.20, a Federal NOV may be needed to bring the permitteeinto compliance with the applicable regulatory program. A number of commenters said that the issuance of an NOV for an improvidentlyissued permit was not authorized by the Act. Some said that OSMRE was notauthorized to issue an NOV in a primacy State, that the proposed rule wasan unauthorized intrusion into State authority vested by the Act over permittingissues and decisions, and that the rule conflicted with OSMRE regulationsrecognizing the exclusive jurisdiction of primacy States as regulatoryauthorities under the Act. Another commenter said there can be only one regulatory authority at atime in a primacy State, and before OSMRE can issue an NOV it must divestthe State of primacy. The commenter said that the rule would require apermittee to meet two different requirements because OSMRE and the Statewere unable to agree on a single interpretation of the Act. OSMRE disagrees. To begin with, the violation on which an NOV under andSection;843.21 is based is not the improvident issuance of the permit, but thepermittee's continuing to operate under a permit that is not authorizedby the regulatory program. Because the permittee can abate this violationby ceasing to operate or by securing abatement of the violation or paymentof the delinquent penalty or fee which should have prevented the issuanceof the permit, in the absence of permit rescission or another appropriateremedial measure the issuance of an NOV is a valid enforcement mechanism.Federal authority for State program oversight and enforcement, includingthe issuance of a Federal NOV, is well-established. For an OSMRE statementof policy on this general issue, see 48 FR 9199 (March 3, 1983). For detailedanalyses of this issue, see the OSMRE ``Notice of availability of petitionto initiate rulemaking and request for comment,'' 51 FR 27197 (July 30,1986); the ``Notice of decision on petition for rulemaking,'' 52 FR 21598(June 8, 1987) (The denial of this petition with respect to Federal NOV'sin primacy States is under appeal in the case of <T3>N.C.A. v Gentile, </T3>No. 87-2076 (D.D.C. 1987)); and the final ruleon the evaluation of State responses to ten-day notices (Ten Day NoticeRule), 53 FR 26728 (July 14, 1988). OSMRE incorporates these documentsby reference into this preamble. Thus, OSMRE has the authority to issue a Federal NOV in a State where operationsare conducted unlawfully under an improvidently issued State permit. Another commenter said that OSMRE has no direct authority to interjectitself into the State permitting process or to require State action, exceptthrough the substitution of Federal enforcement of the State program undersection 521(b) of the Act. OSMRE disagrees that Federal oversight and enforcement of a State programis limited to the specific process set out in section 521(b) of the Act.As discussed in detail in the previously cited references, sections 201and 521(b) and other provisions of the Act authorize OSMRE to take theindividual oversight and enforcement actions provided for in this rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">Oversight of State Permitting Decisions </ITAG>One commenter said that even assuming that OSMRE retained authority toissue a Federal NOV in a primacy State, that authority did not extend toenforcement action resulting from OSMRE reevaluation of a State permittingdecision. Where a State does not take appropriate action on an improvidentlyissued permit, the commenter said, OSMRE must either appeal the State decisionto issue the permit or initiate Federal enforcement under section 521(b)of the Act. The commenter said that to read section 521 of the Act as authorizing Federaloversight of individual State permitting decisions disregarded the Federalistscheme of the Act which granted primacy States exclusive jurisdiction toadminister and enforce their programs. Citing case law and statutory authoritywhich authorized another agency to veto individual permits, the commenterconcluded that OSMRE did not have similar authority, and that primacy Statesretained complete independence in individual permitting decisions. OSMRE disagrees. The enforcement provisions of andSection; 843.21 of thisrule are in accordance with section 521 of the Act, which provides forFederal enforcement where a State does not take appropriate enforcementaction, and section 201(c)(1) of the Act, which gives to the Secretaryof the Interior acting through OSMRE broad powers to suspend, revoke orwithhold any permit for noncompliance with the provisions of the Act orits implementing regulations. The noncompliance in this instance is boththe act of operating under an improvidently issued permit and the underlyingnoncompliance by the permittee or those owning or controlling the permittee.Another commenter cited the case of <T3>Haydo v. Amerikol Mining, Inc., </T3>830 F.2d 494 (3rd Cir. 1987),to support its contention that the rule was an unauthorized intrusion intothe State permitting process. The portion of <T3>Haydo </T3>relied on by the commenter states that<ITAG tagnum="21">In the SMCRA, the state is expressly offered ``exclusive'' jurisdictionto enforce its regulatory program. We have encountered nothing in the statuteor the legislative history which leads us to believe that anything otherthan the ordinary meaning of ``exclusive'' was intended by the enactorsof the SMCRA.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id. </T3>at 497. Citing <T3>In re: Permanent, </T3>653 F.2d at 519, the commenter said that thedecision in <T3>Haydo </T3>followed the views of the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia that ``permit decisions are matters of state jurisdiction inwhich the Secretary plays no role.'' OSMRE disagrees, both with the commenter's characterization of the ruleas an intrusion into the State permitting process, and that these out-of-contextquotations, or the decisions themselves, diminish the legal authority forthis rule. This rule does not improperly intrude into or displace State permittingresponsibilities, nor does it in any way modify the permit issuance process.In primacy States, the States themselves will continue to issue and revisepermits. Section 773.20 of the rule establishes minimum national standardsfor State  regulatory authorities to implement for dealing with an improvidentlyissued State permit. State regulatory authorities will suspend, revokeor take the other remedial measures of this rule against an improvidentlyissued State permit following corresponding State program amendments. This rule does not authorize OSMRE to take any action that would interferewith State permitting activities. Section 843.21 requires OSMRE to requestthat the State regulatory authority take the lead role in curing a defectivepermit. Only where a State does not demonstrate that it has acted appropriately,or show good cause for not doing so, will OSMRE take action. OSMRE oversight action in such circumstances will not include suspensionor rescission of the State permit, a ``permitting'' action, but insteadmay include the issuance of a notice of violation, an enforcement action.This limited Federal role is intended to respect the lead role assumedby the States in administering State programs. With respect to the court decisions cited by the commenter, neither addressesthe scope of section 201(c)(1) of the Act, which provides authority forthis rule. The sentence from <T3>In re: Permanent, </T3>which the commenter quoted only in part, beginswith the qualifying phrase, ``Administrative and judicial appeals * * *,''which significantly limits its scope. <T3>Id. </T3>at 519. This is consistent with the prior statement of thecourt in the same decision that<ITAG tagnum="21">[o]ur inquiry is narrow. We are called upon to determine only whetherthe Secretary has rulemaking authority to require that permit applicantssubmit any items of information beyond those enumerated in the Act.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id. </T3>at 517 (latter emphasis in original, footnote omitted). Asnoted previously, the court held that section 201(c)(2) of the Act providedauthority for requesting information not specifically enumerated in TitleV of the Act. And contrary to the commenter's broad reading, <T3>Haydo </T3>involved the limited procedural<ITAG tagnum="21">Question of whether there is subject matter jurisdiction in the federaldistrict court to hear a claim for damages arising from an alleged violation[of the Act] by an operator * * * where a state has submitted and the Secretaryof the Interior has approved a program for state regulation as contemplatedby the Act.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Haydo, </T3>830 F.2d at 495. Because <T3>Haydo </T3>concerns a citizen's suit brought under section 520 of theAct, it does not address the Secretary's enforcement responsibilities undersection 521 of the Act. The word <T3>``exclusive,'' </T3>which the court in <T3>Haydo </T3>quotes, appears in section 503 of the Act, which containsan exception for OSMRE actions under section 521. This exception was notrelevant in <T3>Haydo, </T3>but is relevant to and supports this rule. In view of their limited applicability, neither of these court decisionscited by the commenter supports any limitation on OSMRE authority for adoptingthis rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">Good Faith Reliance </ITAG>One commenter said that the Act did not authorize permit rescission orother enforcement action for a mistake made by a regulatory authority wherethe permittee was operating in good faith reliance on the regulatory authority'sown findings. Another commenter said that where a permit was improvidentlyissued any responsibility for that occurrence rested with the State regulatoryauthority and not the permittee. OSMRE disagrees. Since section 201(c)(1) of the Act uses the term ``a failure''generally, without regard to cause, it authorizes the revocation of a permitregardless of whether ultimate responsibility for noncompliance with section510(c) of the Act in issuing a permit lies with the permittee, the regulatoryauthority, or some third party, and regardless of any subsequent good-faithreliance on the part of the permittee. As noted in the preceding discussions of andSection;andSection; 773.20 and773.21, however, OSMRE recognizes that under this rule a potential existsfor adversely affecting permittees who otherwise are complying with theregulatory program. To limit that potential, while at the same time ensuringthat serious violations are abated and delinquent penalties and fees arepaid, andSection; 773.20(b) includes carefully selected criteria governingthe circumstances under which a regulatory authority may find that a permitwas improvidently issued; andSection; 773.20(c) includes alternative remedialmeasures which will enable a regulatory authority to respond in a mannerconsistent with those circumstances; and andSection; 773.21 includes a numberof safeguards to protect the legitimate interests of the permittee in therescission process. Given these features, this rule strikes a reasonable balance between therights of permittees and the benefits to be derived from abating violationsand collecting delinquent penalties and fees associated with improvidentlyissued permits.<ITAG tagnum="81">Permit Rescission vs. Revocation </ITAG>Several commenters said that the Act did not authorize rescission of apermit, only revocation. OSMRE disagrees. Although section 201(c)(1) of the Act uses the term <T3>revocation </T3>and not <T3>rescission</T3>, these two terms are equivalent. To differentiate between the revocation of a permit for reasons that existedat the time of permit issuance, and revocation for reasons that subsequentlyarose, OSMRE applies the term <T3>rescind </T3>to the former and <T3>revoke </T3>to the latter. In either case the ultimate effect of rescissionor revocation is identical_the loss of the permit_and the choice of differentterms for each is simply a matter of administrative convenience. <ITAG tagnum="81">Revision of Federal and State Programs </ITAG>One commenter said that the proposed rule would revise existing State andFederal programs, a result which was not authorized by the sections ofthe Act cited in the preamble to the initial proposed rule. Another commentersaid that until a State amended its regulatory program or OSMRE amendedthe Federal program for a State, OSMRE had no authority to implement ina particular State the permit rescission process set out in initial proposedandSection;andSection; 773.20 and 843.21. As one commenter correctly pointed out, however, section 504 of the Act,30 U.S.C. 1254, provides specific authority for the promulgation of a Federalprogram. Likewise, section 504 authorizes OSMRE to revise a Federal program.Thus, to the extent this rule revises Federal programs it is authorizedby section 504 of the Act.  As stated in the preamble to the initial proposed rule (51 FR 25827) andin this preamble under the subsequent headings, III. Procedural Matters,Effect in Federal Program States and on Indian Lands, this rule will applythrough cross-referencing to the Federal program States. Thus, no furtheraction is needed to incorporate its requirements into Federal programs.Contrary to the commenters' assertions, this rule does not revise any Stateprogram. While andSection; 843.21 refers to ``the State program equivalentsof andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 773.21,'' this rule does not establishany such equivalents, which must be done, where appropriate, in accordancewith the procedures set out at 30 CFR 732.17. Nor does andSection; 843.21 implement in any State program a permit rescissionprocess. While initial proposed andSection; 843.21 was predicated on a Statenot taking appropriate action under proposed andSection; 772.20(b), and thusappeared to require State compliance with that section, later proposedand final andSection; 843.21 require a State to take appropriate action underthe State proqram equivalents of andSection;andSection; 773.20 and 773.21.Finally, andSection; 843.21 does not include procedures for permit suspensionor rescission, either at the State or Federal level. Section 843.21 onlyauthorizes OSMRE to impose appropriate remedial measures, including theissuance of an NOV, if a State does not have and does not take appropriateaction under State program equivalents of andSection;andSection; 773.20 and773.21. Under this rule, only a State may suspend or rescind an improvidentlyissued State permit. <ITAG tagnum="81">Need for Inspection </ITAG>One commenter said that OSMRE authority to issue an NOV generally is predicatedon the outcome of a Federal inspection. Thus, for example, the ten-daynotice procedures of existing andSection; 843.12(a)(2) came into play ``onthe basis of any Federal inspection other than one described in paragraph(a)(1) of this section.'' OSMRE disagrees. The basis for an NOV is a determination by the regulatoryauthority that a violation exists, which need not come about as a resultof an actual on-site review. <ITAG tagnum="81">Applicant Information </ITAG>One commenter said that to the extent initial proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(1)requested information on parties who own or control the applicant it exceededthe authority provided by section 510(c) of the Act. Neither initial proposed andSection; 773.20(a)(1) nor its final counterpartdirectly require a permittee to provide any information. The requirementsof andSection; 773.20 apply where a regulatory authority has informationwhich gives it reason to believe that it improvidently issued a surfacecoal mining and reclamation permit. Section 773.20 does not, however, requirethe permittee to submit any additional information. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Relationship to OSMRE Rule on Ownership and Control </ITAG>Several commenters said that it was not appropriate to propose this ruleuntil after OSMRE published the final ownership and control rule. Somesaid it was not possible to comment adequately on the proposed rule inthe absence of that final rule. Some suggested that OSMRE extend the commentperiod on the rule until ninety days after the ownership and control rulewas promulgated. OSMRE disagrees, and declined to adopt the commenters' suggestion. Althoughthis rule relates to the concurrently proposed ownership and control rule,for which the final rule was published by OSMRE on October 3, 1988 (53FR 38868), it does not depend on the specific wording of that rule.Moreover, the commenters on the August 4, 1988, later proposed rule hadthe benefit of the last proposal for the ownership and control rule, publishedon October 5, 1987 (52 FR 37164). Based on the comments received, it isevident that even without the final ownership and control rule interestedpersons were able to submit focused and meaningful comments on this rule.One commenter, who had read the preamble to the initial proposed rule asindicating that OSMRE intended to apply the definitions in the final ownershipand control rule retroactively, said that the later proposed rule appearedto address this objection, but fell short of resolving the problem completely.The commenter said that the ownership and control criteria set out in therule did not reflect the date when the underlying violations review criteriabecame effective in a particular regulatory program. Citing <T3>United States v. Shelton Coal Corp., </T3>829 F.2d 1336, 1339-40 (4thCir. 1987), the commenter said that operators reasonably relied on therules in force at the time of permit issuance, and applying a differentstandard would be unfair and unconscionable. Thus, the commenter concluded,the rule should apply a particular violations review criterion only afterit was included in the regulatory program. OSMRE appreciates the commenter's concern, which is one reason why it publishedthe later proposed rule. As stated in the preceding discussion of andSection;773.20, this rule applies only to those ownership and control links coveredby the applicable regulatory program at the time the permit was issued.To the extent the commenter may have cited the decision in <T3>Shelton </T3>as precedent for the position that OSMRE lacks authorityto adopt a rule requiring the suspension or rescission of permits issuedprior to its effective date, OSMRE disagrees that the decision has anybearing on this issue. In <T3>Shelton, </T3>which concerned the liability of an operator under theapproved Virginia State program for the payment of reclamation fees, thecourt said<ITAG tagnum="21">[t]here was a basis for * * * reasonable reliance, upon Virginia'sexemption, and Virginia's interpretation of the statute was a rationalone. There was no indication that the interpretation contravened any federalrule.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id.</T3> at 1339. In the case of an improvidently issued permit, however,there is no corresponding basis for a permittee's reliance on noncompliancewith the requirements of section 510(c) of the Act, which directly contravenesthe related Federal and State procedures. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Rule is Not Retroactive </ITAG>Several commenters on the initial proposed rule were opposed to its allegedretroactive application. The commenters said that while some operatorstemporarily would escape action as a result of not applying the rule toexisting permits, this would avoid a tendency of the regulatory authorityto reexamine every previously issued permit application, which would causechaos in the regulated community. The commenters, concerns are not well-founded. This rule is targeted onlyat improvidently issued permits, and is not intended to disrupt any permitteeoperating under a permit that was validly issued. In response to commenter concern over retroactive application of the initialproposed rule, the later proposed rule included several alternatives. Onecommenter said that these alternatives should not be considered becausethey would provide for the rescission of permits properly issued underthe regulatory program. OSMRE is sensitive to such concerns over changes in regulatory programstandards after permit issuance. This rule requires no remedial actionagainst a permit that was properly issued in accordance with the regulatoryprogram in effect at the time the permit was issued. The same commenter said that permit rescission should apply only to permitsissued after the effective date of the rule or any corresponding Stateprogram amendments. The commenter said that numerous permanent programpermits have been issued for ongoing operations, and it would not be fairto subject them to rescission through retroactive application of the rule.OSMRE disagrees that the rule as adopted is retroactive. This rule doesnot change any permitting standard, either retroactively or prospectively,but requires the regulatory authority to apply the violations review criteriaof the regulatory program at the time of permit issuance in determiningthe current violations review status of a permit. It will not affect anypermit for which a previous violations review defect has been correctedor otherwise has ceased to exist. The rule will apply prospectively to existing Federal permits, and to Statepermits whenever consistent regulations are approved as amendments to Stateregulatory programs. <T3>The rule will operate only with respect to violations, penalties andfees that remain outstanding. </T3>Violations may be abated at any time,and once abated their past existence will not result in any proceedingsunder this rule. Thus, the rule recognizes the commenter's concern andenables the permittee to legitimize activities under an improvidently issuedpermit through abatement of the underlying violation or payment of thedelinquent penalty or fee.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Procedural Matters </ITAG>Effect in Federal Program States and on Indian Lands Sections 773.20 and 773.21 of this rule will apply, through cross-referencing,to the following Federal program States: California, Georgia, Idaho, Massachussetts,Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennesseeand Washington. The Federal programs for these States appear at 30 CFRParts 905, 910, 912, 921, 922, 933, 937, 939, 941, 942 and 947, respectively.No comments were received concerning unique conditions in any of theseStates which would require changes to the national rules or to any of theFederal programs. The same sections of this rule also will apply, through cross-referencingat 30 CFR Part 750, to surface coal mining and reclamation operations onIndian lands. By its own terms, andSection; 843.21 of this rule does not apply to Federalprogram States or on Indian lands, but only to those States with Stateprograms.Federal Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule contains no information collection requirements, and thus doesnot require Office of Management and Budget approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq</T3>.Executive Order 12291The Department of the Interior has examined this rule according to thecriteria of Executive Order 12291 (February 17, 198l) and has determinedthat it is not major and does not require a regulatory impact analysis.This rule will impose only minor costs on the coal industry and coal consumers.It will not impose any significant new regulatory burden on operators becauseit does not change the existing permitting obligations of OSMRE, Stateregulatory authorities, permit applicants, and operators, but providesregulatory authorities with supplemental procedures for ensuring that operatorsare in full compliance with existing regulations.Thus, this rule should not add appreciably to the cost of operating a minein compliance with an approved regulatory program.Regulatory Flexibility ActFor the reasons discussed in the previous paragraph, the Department ofthe Interior also has determined, pursuant to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>., that this rule will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.Some initial commenters said that OSMRE did not comply with the RegulatoryFlexibility Act in proposing this rule. Others said that OSMRE did notcomply with Executive Order 12291. They said that the proposed rule wouldmake it more difficult for United States-based industry to meet foreigncompetition, and would impose major new costs on the coal industry andon consumers. Another commenter said that the rule would reduce the numberof jobs in the surface coal mining industry.OSMRE disagrees. Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Actwere complied with in promulgating the rule. This rule imposes no new regulatoryburden on operators, and will not affect the ability of United States-basedindustry to compete with foreign operators, nor will it add to the costsof industry or of consumers. OSMRE analyzed the effect of this rule onjobs, small entities, and on other economic factors, and found that itwill have only minimal effect, if any.OSMRE also considered possible significant economic effects on small entities_thoseoperators whose surface and underground coal production does not exceed100,000 tons annually. Because this rule imposes no direct regulatory burdenon operators, the effect of the rule will not be major, and it should havelittle or no economic effect on small entities who otherwise are in compliancewith the Act.Executive Order 12612In accordance with section 6(b) of Executive Order 12612, OSMRE has determinedthat this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment.One commenter said that the later proposed rule conflicted with OSMRE regulationsrecognizing the exclusive jurisdiction of primacy States as regulatoryauthorities, and failed to satisfy the agency's obligations under ExecutiveOrder 12612 regarding federalism principles.OSMRE disagrees. The rule fully recognizes and is consistent with the primaryrole of State regulatory authorities in administering and enforcing Stateregulatory programs. The rule does nothing to alter any State program requirementin force at the time of permit issuance. In keeping with the Federalismprinciples embodied in the Act, the rule gives a State a reasonable opportunityto take appropriate action on an improvidently issued permit.As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, this rule does not unnecessarilyintrude into activities delegated to States, but facilitates the Secretary'smandatory role in the oversight of State regulatory programs as requiredby the Act.National Environmental Policy ActOSMRE has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) and has made a finding(FONSI) that this rule will not significantly affect the quality of thehuman environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). The rule should resultin better compliance with the environmental standards of the Act, and thereforeresult in enhanced protection of the environment.The EA and FONSI are on file in the OSMRE Administrative Record at theaddress specified previously (see ``<T2>ADDRESSES</T2>'').AuthorThe author of this rule is Albert A.
