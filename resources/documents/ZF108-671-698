 The raster image can be edited,using commands such as &quot;rub,&quot; &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;crop.&quot; The finished image can bestored, or it can be input into other conversion programs such as ArborScanor Draftsman.andM;CAD Overlay ESP may be an essential item in converting blueprints rather thandrawings, since scanned blueprints often need extensive editing prior toconversion for good results.andM;Alternatively, a user can trace the raster image to create a true AutoCADdrawing.andP;  This approach is much faster than tracing an original drawing usinga digitizer.andM;CAD Overlay ESP creates drawings that are a hybrid of raster scan lines andtypical AutoCAD vector entities.andP;  The process of plotting the combined imageis inconvenient.andP;  Users must create a plot-file description from withinAutoCAD and then run a separate utility from the DOS command prompt or useAutoCAD's &quot;shell&quot; command to reach the DOS prompt.andP;  According to companyofficials, a new release of CAD Overlay ESP will allow direct plotting.andM;CAD Overlay's documentation lacks an index and assumes that the user isknowledgeable about AutoCAD configuration.andM;Other implementations of CAD Overlay ESP are available for most popular CADprograms.andP;  For example, CADworks' Drawbase includes the ability to overlayimages, although editing of the raster image is not yet available.andM;Image Systems recently began shipping a new version of CAD OverLay ESP.andO;According to company officials, the new version allows multiple raster imagesto be displayed on-screen simultaneously, and it supports polygon erasuresand fixes skewed drawings.andP;  The documentation for this new version is beingrewritten, they said.andM;Image Systems Technology Inc., of Troy, N.Y., can be reached at (518)283-8783.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;Until someone comes up with a better way of automatically translating apaper drawing into a CAD file, CAD Overlay ESP is the best way to go,&quot; saidRoger Kamys, president of Mid-CAD Inc., a CAD service company in Chicago.andM;Kamys evaluated other utilities, including Microtek Lab Inc.'s CADmate,before purchasing CAD Overlay ESP.andP;  These other utilities, however, did notconvert the scanned images accurately.andP;  &quot;The drawing wasn't converted in thefashion you would draw it,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;With CAD Overlay you can createsome objects in CAD that would be difficult to create otherwise.&quot;andM;&quot;The most important feature,&quot; said Kamys, &quot;is the ability to have AutoCADdrawings and scanned images coexist.andP;  You have the capability to takesomething on paper, bring it up in AutoCAD, and merge the drawing and AutoCADvector together as a scanned image that you can print out.&quot;andM;The program is easy to learn, he added.andP;  &quot;What I liked about CAD Overlay isthat if you're familiar with AutoCAD, once you see the image on the screen,you can work with it.&quot;andM;Scorpion Technologies Inc. has a raster-to-vector conversion program thatdoes the same thing the reviewed programs do, but carries an $18,000 pricetag and is available only through resellers.andM;Scorpion's SRV386 1.00 sports a wide array of parameter settings -- 28 in all-- allowing a user to make limitless adjustments to the settings for eachdrawing.andP;  With the correct settings, the conversion is excellent.andP;  In PC Weektesting, however, finding the correct settings was nearly impossible.andM;Many of the parameter settings are dependent on each other and requirecareful selection.andP;  For example, increasing the control-tolerance parameter,which increases the accuracy of the conversion of the scanned image, requiresan increase in the circle- and arc-recognition tolerance to avoid the loss ofarc and circle identification.andM;Even after spending more than four hours on the phone with Scorpion's supporttechnicians, and after a visit from a reseller, PC Week was unable to createa satisfactory conversion of the printed nozzle drawing.andP;  The conversion tookabout 30 minutes, more than three times as long as Draftsman for the samedrawing.andP;  Moreover, the quality was not as good, and many details were lost.andM;According to one user accustomed to working with minicomputer products,however, SRV386 quickly converts raster files to CAD files.andM;&quot;I did a 300K raster file, and converting it took 23 minutes,&quot; said RobinSyme, a technician at RCS Services Inc., a CAD service and consulting firm inNew Westminster, British Columbia.andP;  &quot;SRV turned out 60 to 65 percent of thedrawing.&quot;andM;Charles Cohen, director of sales and marketing for Comp-Tron Inc., a CADproduct reseller in Baltimore, is also pleased with SRV386's performance.andM;&quot;We had a thousand maps that had to be converted within a certain timeframe,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The actual conversion itself is taking around an hour [perdrawing].andP;  We couldn't have done it without SRV386.&quot;andM;Both buyers noted that the product's documentation is excellent and helpsmake the product easier to use.andM;&quot;It takes a little while to configure for your machine, but the manuals arereally good, and you can follow them through very easily,&quot; said Syme.andM;&quot;The manuals are there primarily to explain the interaction of theparameters,&quot; added Cohen.andM;SRV386 requires a 386 computer with 8M bytes of extended memory.andP;  CAD OverlayESP is included with the program.andP;
