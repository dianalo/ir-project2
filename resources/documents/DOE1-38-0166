Emission of various toxic compounds from wood burning canexist in the atmosphere as gas or particle phase or both. Under stagnationconditions these toxic compounds can stay in the atmosphere for severaldata potentially causing health problems. This study is focused to evaluatethe fate of these toxic compounds emitted from wood stoves in a valleyduring typical winter season. The study includes application of a simplebox model to evaluate the concentration of these compounds. Developmentof emission inventory, gas to particle formation and removal processesare also discussed. The results of this study will be useful to assessthe health risks due to wood burning in a typical valley during the winterseason.</TEXT></DOC>
