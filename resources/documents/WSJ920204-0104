In order to fully complywith federal regulations that are in effect today, you wouldhave to:   First examine the roof to determine whether asbestos ispresent. There is a good chance that an asphalt roof will atleast include asbestos-containing base flashings and cements;if they do, Environmental Protection Agency regulations willapply, and Occupational Safety and Health Agency regulationsmay apply.</LP><TEXT>   It is very likely that you won't know from a visualexamination whether asbestos is present. In that case, youwill have to cut a sample from the roof, and patch it toavoid leaks at the point of the sample cut. You will thensend the sample, after you have bagged it properly, to anaccredited laboratory, and delay your repair work until thesample is analyzed. (In some states, only a certifiedabatement contractor is allowed to make this test cut.)   If you discover that asbestos is contained in the roof,you must:   Notify the owner (your neighbor) in writing;   notify the EPA Regional Office (10 days prior to beginningwork, which will mean your neighbor's roof will continue toleak);   be sure that at least one person on your repair crew istrained to satisfy EPA requirements;   conduct air monitoring on the job, once you are able tostart work, to determine whether emissions of asbestos willexceed OSHA's action level. You can't do this, of course,until the 10-day EPA notification period has passed.   Once you begin any repair work, you will have to&quot;adequately wet&quot; the materials. EPA defines this as&quot;thoroughly penetrating&quot; the asbestos-containing material,which is an interesting concept for a waterproof materiallike asphalt. EPA also stipulates that there be no &quot;visibleemissions&quot; on the job, even if you can demonstrate that theemissions contain no asbestos fibers.   You will then have to vacuum the dust generated by any&quot;cutting&quot; that you do, put it in double bags, and take it toan approved landfill.   You will also be responsible for prohibiting smoking onthe job site, and are subject to fine if one of youremployees lights up.   You will probably wonder why your neighbor will be askedto absorb all of the costs associated with these steps, sincehundreds of test samples have shown no asbestos exposuresabove acceptable limits in roofing operations.   You must ensure that your crew is trained about anyhazardous materials that they may encounter. (These willinclude the gasoline you use to power the pump on yourroofing kettle.) You will also have to be sure that copies ofthe appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets are present atthe work site, and that all containers are properly labeled.   Your crew must also be thoroughly trained in handlingthese materials. This will be determined not by what stepsyou have taken to train them, but by what your employees tellthe OSHA inspector who asks them what they have been taught.   Because you are transporting asphalt at a temperatureabove 212 degrees, so that your crew won't have to wait twoor three hours at your neighbor's home for the asphalt toheat, you must:   Mark the side of your roofing kettle with a sticker thatsays &quot;HOT&quot; in capital letters;   complete shipping papers before the truck leaves youryard;   have emergency response procedures developed in the eventthe kettle should turn over en route to your neighbor's home;   be sure that your driver has been drug-tested, and has acommercial driver's license;   be sure that the driver completes his log sheets for theday, and stops 25 miles after he leaves your yard to see ifthe load has shifted;   be sure that your kettle has a hazardous material placard,in addition to the &quot;HOT&quot; sticker mentioned above.   Because your vehicle is being driven for work-relatedmatters, you must be sure that the driver wears his seatbelt, and has received driver training. If he does not wearhis seat belt, you, of course, will be fined.   Assuming you have met other OSHA safety standards, and aresatisfied you will be in compliance with local and stateregulations, it is now safe for you to begin. Your mostdangerous act, however, is yet to come: presenting yourneighbor with his bill, and explaining why your costs haveincreased so dramatically in the three years since theseregulations have been promulgated.   ---   Mr. Rosenow is president of the National RoofingContractors Association in Rosemont, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
