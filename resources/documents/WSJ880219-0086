Woolworth Inc., said it bought 22 of Tennis Lady Inc.'s 23 retail outlets.    Terms weren't disclosed.    Tennis Lady, Dallas, retails women's clothing. Woolworth and Kinney are based in New York.    Michael J. Blumenfeld, Tennis Lady president, said the company was selling the stores and shutting down most of its business because of poor results. &quot;Tennis is down. Retailing is down. There's not much hope for it and that's all there is to it,&quot; he said.    Mr. Blumenfeld estimated that the business lost about $2 million in 1987 on sales of about $9 million; final results haven't been issued.    Tennis Lady will be left with one store in Houston that Kinney isn't buying because it has other stores nearby. &quot;But we expect to get rid of that soon as well,&quot; Mr. Blumenfeld said. He added that Kinney wouldn't operate the stores as Tennis Lady but expected to turn them into Lady Footlockers, Footlockers and other stores that the company operates.    Tennis Lady said that after the sale it expects to &quot;dissolve the company or invest in new businesses.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
