The photoelectrochemical characteristicsof the deposited film as the photo-anode were examined. A precursor ofCuIn{sub 5}S{sub 8} was precipitated at high yield heating the aqueoussolution containing CuCl{sub 2}, InCl{sub 3}, Na{sub 2}S{sub 2}O{sub3} and acetic acid at 80{sup 0}C for an hour. Solid spinel-type CuIn{sub5}S{sub 8} was produced heating at 600{sup 0}C the precipitate just afterthe reaction. The thin film electrode prepared by the electrophoreticdeposition shows n-type polarization behaviour, providing the photocurrentof 10 mA/cm{sup 2} at the highest by the irradiation with white lightexcluding infrared rays. The fand gaps of the semiconductor of chemicalcompound for the direct and indirect transitions are 1.43 and 1.30eV,respectively. The conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cell is approximately1%.
