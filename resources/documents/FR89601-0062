OnNovember 28, 1980 (45 FR 79318), EPA announced the publication of 64 individualambient water quality criteria documents for pollutants listed as toxicunder section 307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act. A criteria document for2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was published on February 15,1984 (49 FR 5831), completing the coverage of the 65 toxic pollutants listedunder Section 307(a)(1).EPA issued nine individual water quality criteria documents on July 29,1985 (50 FR 30784) which updated or revised criteria previously publishedin the ``Red Book'' or in the 1980 water quality criteria documents. Arevised version of the ``National Guidelines for Deriving Numerical NationalWater Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and TheirUses'' was announced at the same time. A bacteriological ambient waterquality criteria document was published on March 7, 1986 (51 FR 8012).A water quality criteria document for dissolved oxygen was published onJune 24, 1986 (51 FR 22978). All of the publications cited above were summarizedin ``Quality Criteria for Water, 1986'' which was released by the Officeof Water Regulations and Standards on December 3, 1986 (51 FR 43665). Finalwater quality criteria documents for chlorpyrifos, nickel, pentachlorophenol,parathion, and toxaphene were also issued by EPA on December 3, 1986 (51FR 43665). On March 2, 1987, (52 FR 6213), EPA announced the publicationof revised ambient water quality criteria for zinc which updated criteriapreviously published in the 1980 ambient water quality document. On January5, 1988, (53 FR 177), EPA announced the publication of revised ambientwater quality criteria for selenium which also updated criteria previouslypublished in 1980. Final documents were issued for chloride on May 26,1988 (53 FR 19028) and for aluminum on August 30, 1988 (53 FR 33177). Noprevious guidance had been issued for these substances.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Criteria Document</ITAG>Today EPA is announcing the proposed tributyltin (TBT) water quality criteriadocument for the protection of aquatic organisms; the document is now availablefor public comment. Tributyltin is an organotin compound that is used asan active ingredient in antifouling coatings to reduce the growth of sessileaquatic organisms on surfaces submerged in water, such as ship hulls. OnJanuary 8, 1986, EPA issued a notice of Special Review, under the FederalInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, on certain pesticide productscontaining tributyltin used as antifoulants (51 FR 778). On October 4,1988, EPA issued a partial conclusion of the Special Review and noticeof intent to cancel registrations and deny applications for all pesticideproducts containing TBT as an active ingredient for use as antifoulantsunless the registrations/applications comply with the specific terms andconditions provided in the notice (53 FR 39022). Specific terms and conditionsestablished under the Act include an interim release rate restriction andcertification program; this program will expire when a final Special Reviewdecision regarding the release of organotin into the aquatic environmentis issued and takes effect. The Act also requires EPA to issue a finalwater quality criteria document concerning organotin compounds by March30, 1989. The Agency chose to propose a document addressing TBT specificallybecause it is the most toxic form of organotin used in antifouling paintsand is used in 99 percent of antifouling formulations now on the market.It is the only organotin with sufficient data available to calculate criterionvalues.EPA previously issued a water quality advisory for tributyltin in September1987. Subsequent to the last literature search cited in the criteria document,EPA continued to collect publications on the effects of tributyltin. Thesepublications, and others identified by the public during the public commentperiod, will be considered during review of the document. Particular attentionwill be directed toward data indicating that some species of marine snailsmay be sensitive to concentrations of TBT which are lower than the concentrationpublished in the advisory and the criterion continuous concentration (CCC)proposed in this criteria document. Information relevant to this sensitivityis particularly requested. EPA will review all information submitted todetermine if the proposed criteria should remain as proposed or be modified.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William A.

Such a standard specifies a criterionfor a pollutant that is consistent with a particular designated use. Withthe concurrence of the U.S. EPA, States designate one or more uses foreach body of water or segment thereof and adopt criteria that are consistentwith the use(s). In each standard a State may adopt the national criterion,if one exists, or if adequately justified, a site-specific criterion. (Ifthe site is an entire State, the site-specific criterion is also a State-specificcriterion). Site-specific criteria may include not only site-specific criterionconcentrations, but also site-specific, and possibly pollutant-specific,durations of averaging periods and frequencies of allowed excursions. Theaveraging periods of ``one hour'' and ``four days'' were selected by theU.S. EPA on the basis of data concerning how rapidly some aquatic speciesreact to increases in the concentrations of some pollutants.Three years is the Agency's best scientific judgment of the average amountof time aquatic ecosystems should be provided between excursions. However,various species and ecosystems react and recover at greatly differing rates.Therefore, if adequate justification is provided, site-specific and/orpollutant-specific concentrations, durations, and frequencies may be higheror lower than those given in national water quality criteria for aquaticlife.Use of criteria, which have been adopted in state water quality standards,for developing water quality-based permit limits and for designing wastetreatment facilities requires selection of an appropriate wasteload allocationmodel. Although dynamic models are preferred for the application of thesecriteria limited data or other considerations might require the use ofa steady-state model. Guidance on mixing zones and the design of monitoringprograms is also available through the U.S. EPA.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-12991 Filed 5-31-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
