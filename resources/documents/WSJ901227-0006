But the same warning goes for investors who receive phonecalls from dealers offering to buy bonds they already own.</LP><TEXT>   The dealer may be trying to buy the bonds at cut-rateprices to resell directly to the issuer at higher prices.   Even if the dealer is offering what may initially soundlike an attractive price, several bond-market specialistsadvise against leaping at the offer. With a little bit ofdetective work and comparison shopping, savvy investors maybe able to do even better.   Bond issuers often need to buy back some of their bonds tofulfill what is known as a &quot;sinking-fund&quot; requirement. Thisrefers to a provision in the fine print of many municipal andcorporate bonds requiring or permitting issuers to buy backsome of their bonds at specified intervals before the finalmaturity date.   The risk for unwary investors was brought into sharperfocus by recent charges that a former state-agency officialin Kentucky and his father profited from &quot;misuse ofconfidential information&quot; relating to a sinking-fund program.Several bond specialists say the case involves what areprobably the first indictments charging insider-trading inmunicipal bonds.   The two men, Noble Donald Morse II, who wassecretary-treasurer of Kentucky's Infrastructure Authority,and his father, Donald Morse, are accused of making about$7,000 by buying bonds they knew could be resold to theauthority at higher prices. They were indicted by a grandjury under a state law in late October.   The Morses have pleaded not guilty. J. Guthrie True, alawyer representing them, says a motion has been filed todismiss the charges. He says the Kentucky statute is&quot;unconstitutionally vague, because it fails to define whatconstitutes confidential information.&quot;   Typically, issuers subject to mandatory sinking-fundrequirements have a choice of ways to meet them. Often, theycan redeem a certain amount of bonds at a specified price --such as &quot;par,&quot; or the bond's face value -- with holders drawnby lot. Or they can try to buy enough of their bonds in theresale market, at lower prices, to fulfill the requirement.   Several municipalities and companies hire specialists tocontact bondholders directly. The firm writes letterssummarizing the sinking-fund requirement and asks holders ifthey would be interested in selling, and, if so, to specify aprice. After the bids come in, the lowest prices areaccepted, usually up to the limit of the sinking-fundrequirement -- although sometimes the agency can buy evenmore than that.   For example, Fiduciary Communications Co. of New York saysit is working on a sinking-fund retirement program forseveral issues of New Jersey's Housing Finance Agency, whichsubsequently merged with another agency to become the NewJersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. About 2,000bondholders soon will receive letters asking if they want tosell, and at what price. The letters also will give an 800number for holders to call.   Fiduciary recently handled a sinking-fund retirementprogram for Kansas City, Mo., special facility airportrevenue bonds issued to help finance a facility for TransWorld Airlines. It received 211 tender offers, of which 167came from individuals, says Amy Winchell, a vice president ofFiduciary.   Large brokerage houses often get involved withsinking-fund redemptions, too. Usually they actindependently, trying to make a profit for themselves bycontacting large institutions and individual holders to buyback bonds to resell to issuers.   What should investors do if they get a call from someoneoffering to buy their bonds? First, several traders say, askthe callers why they want the bonds so badly and whether it'sbecause of a sinking-fund requirement.   Frank Scaraggi, an executive vice president at LehmanBrothers, advises: &quot;Ask whoever is giving you the bid, `Areyou buying these for an active sinker,' that is, for anissuer that is satisfying a sinking-fund requirement. Thenask for more information, and any reputable broker shouldgive you more, including what they think the sinker willpay.&quot;   Even if the offer still sounds good, don't stop there, Mr.Scaraggi and many others suggest. Investors should check thefairness of the price by calling at least two other firmsthey trust. Prices often vary widely from one firm toanother, especially on municipal bonds -- and especially fortrades of $25,000 or less.   Ask for any research reports the firms have on the issuer,and whether the issuer's credit ratings have changed sincethe bonds were issued; these factors can greatly affect theprice. Also check the prospectus or official statement fordetails of the bond's sinking-fund requirements.   In some cases, large bondholders may be able to get moreinformation by contacting the issuer directly. Sometreasurers say they are willing to explain the intricacies oftheir sinking-fund requirements to bondholders -- and even tosteer them to major market-makers in those bonds.   &quot;The last thing we want to have is a situation wheresomeone thinks there's no secondary market&quot; for the bonds,says the treasurer of one municipal agency. On rareoccasions, he says, the agency might even agree to buy backbonds directly from investors holding large blocks, typically$100,000 or more.   Investors who don't want to worry about the intricacies ofsinkers can buy shares of mutual funds and let fund managersworry about it. Or they can stick to buying U.S. Treasurybills, notes and bonds, which don't have sinking funds.</TEXT></DOC>
