At the same time, contactswith research institutes and other organizations in the USSR were established.The possibility of Finnish-Soviet co-operation was discussed. Promisingareas for co-operation are, for example, the reduction of the consumptionof sorbents when limestone is used to bind sulphur, the simultaneousremoval of sulphur and nitrogen oxides by means of ozone, the chemicalirradiation of flue gas, and the desulphurization of coal gas duringthe gasification of solid fuels. Further co-operation consists of a moredetailed study of the methods mentioned above. Opportunities for co-operationin production and marketing are also being investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
