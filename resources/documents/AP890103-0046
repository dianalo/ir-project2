The veterans have formed a ``war council'' and are offering themoney for the first significant government building the insurgentsdestroy, group spokesman Ted Sampley said.   ``We believe the only way the truth and any living Americanprisoner of war will ever be liberated from Laos is if the PathetLao (communist party) are driven from Laos,'' he said. ``We're goingto encourage (the insurgents) to take on the Pathet Lao any way theycan.''   Sampley, who spoke in a telephone interview from the UnitedStates, is chairman of the National Steering Committee For VietnamWar Veterans. The private lobbying group has accused the U.S.government of failing to secure the release of Americans held fromthe Indochina War, which ended with communist victories in Cambodia,Laos and Vietnam in 1975.   The Laotian government has repeatedly denied holding anyAmericans from the war and has reacted angrily to privateinitiatives.   The U.S. government also has criticized these privateinitiatives, preferring official contacts with the Laotianauthorities, whom it says have increased cooperation in recentmonths.   A total of 547 Americans are officially listed as missing inaction, or MIA, in Laos, but U.S. officials said all but one arepresumed dead.   ``If the Reagan administration will encourage private citizens tohelp the Contras (insurgents in Nicaragua), then by God we can helpthe Laotians against the Pathet Lao communists,'' said Sampley, aformer Green Beret from Kinston, N.C.   He said the $5,000 had been donated by a private U.S. citizen butwould not identify the person.   Insurgents based along the Thai and Chinese borders have foughtthe Laotian government since the Pathet Lao seized power in December1975, but do not appear to pose a major security risk. The U.S.government says it gives no support to the insurgents.   In October, Sampley led a group of Americans to Thailand. On theMekong River, which separates Thailand and Laos, they floatedcurrency notes stamped with another reward offer _ $2.4 million toanyone who brings out a live prisoner.   Two members of the group were detained by the Laotians for 41days after they illegally crossed to the Laotian side of the river.   Last month, U.S. and Laotian experts conducted their fourth jointexcavation of a U.S. warplane crash site in Laos and found one setof human remains.   The MIA issue was expected to be discussed during talks this weekbetween Laos' deputy foreign minister, Soubanh Srithirath, andRichard Childress, director of Asian affairs at the U.S. NationalSecurity Council.   Childress was accompanied on the trip by Ann Mills Griffiths, thehead of the National League of POW-MIA Families, a private lobbyinggroup.   The official Laotian radio said Soubanh and Childress met inLaos' capital of Vientiane on Monday and were expected to meet againtoday.   ``The consultative meeting proceeded in a good andstraightforward atmosphere,'' said a text of Monday's broadcast,which was seen in Bangkok today.</TEXT></DOC>
