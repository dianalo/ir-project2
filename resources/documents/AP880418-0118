At issue: Whether unwed fathers who actively seek custody oftheir children may be stripped of all parental rights if adoptionis deemed to be in the childrens' best interest.   The justices said they will use a case from San Diego, Calif.,to review rulings that terminated Edward McNamara's parental rightsto his daughter, Katie, who is now 6 years old.   McNamara and Katie's mother, unidentified in court records, hadnot seen each other for eight months when Katie was born in 1981.McNamara did not learn of the pregnancy or birth until he was toldKatie, then a month old, had been placed in a foster home awaitingadoption.   He quickly sought custody.   Katie was 5 months old before a trial was held on McNamara'scustody request, and a California judge ruled that it was inKatie's best interest to stay with the foster parents she had beenliving with.   The foster parents wanted to adopt Katie, and the judge ruledthat the baby girl had ``bonded'' with them.   The judge acknowledged that McNamara was a ``good parent (who)can provide a good, loving home for the child.''   The California Supreme Court reversed the ruling, stating thatcustody could not be awarded to a non-parent unless awardingcustody of the child to one of its parents who sought custody wouldbe detrimental to the child.   The state's highest court sent the case back to a trial court todetermine whether the passage of time had made an award of custodyto McNamara detrimental for Katie, by then adopted.   The trial court in 1985 ruled against McNamara, and stripped himof all of his parental rights to Katie. The judge, however,encouraged Katie's adoptive parents to make Edward part of Katie'slife.   In the appeal acted on today, McNamara argued that his treatmentin the California courts violated his equal-protection rights.   He noted that wed fathers cannot lose their parental rightsunless they are found to have no interest or ability in parentingthe child.   And he noted that unwed mothers would not lose their parentalrights under similar circumstances.   The justices agreed to study the case and, if they find theyhave the proper jurisdiction, to rule on whether McNamara receivedfair treatment.   In other action the court:   _ Agreed to decide whether states may bar political partyleaders from endorsing primary election candidates and whetherstates may regulate political party structure.   The justices said they will consider reinstating parts of aCalifornia law overturned as infringements on citizens' rights toexpress themselves and associate with whom they please.   _ Refused to let a Dallas blood bank withhold the names andmedical records of its donors from a woman who says her husbandcontracted AIDS after receiving transfusions.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that donors'privacy rights do not override Patty Jo Baker's need to find outtheir identities for her wrongful-death lawsuit.   _ Left intact a key federal regulation designed to fostercompetition within the natural gas industry.   The justices, without comment, rejected appeals by pipelinecompanies that claim the rule places them in an unfair economicbind.   _ Rejected an appeal by U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings, whosays he unlawfully is being subjected to possible impeachment.   The court, without comment, left intact a 1980 law under whichfellow judges asked the House of Representatives to considerimpeaching Hastings for alleged judicial misconduct.   _ Refused to let the government approve the use in cosmetics ofcolor additives that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by the cosmeticsindustry that safe substances are being forced off the market.   _ Let stand a ruling that a worker may not be fired for refusingon religious grounds to pay union dues.

The court's decision, expected sometime next year, will resolveconflicting rulings by federal appeals courts.   The adoption case is McNamara vs. San Diego County, 87-5840.</TEXT></DOC>
