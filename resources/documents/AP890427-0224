No pickup</HEAD><DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Jose Sarney announced onThursday night an emergency measure restricting the right to strikeand imposing other curbs, saying ``savage waves of strikes''threaten to undermine democracy in financially distressed Brazil.   `I do not condemn legitimate strikes guaranteed by theconstitution,'' he said over national TV. ``But I cannot toleratethe action of hoodlums who through violence occupy factories, orarmed demonstrators who throw bombs.''   During his 10-minute address, Sarney attacked ``political groupswho do not accept the democratic game'' for what he called illegalstrikes that paralyzed key economic sectors.   Much of Brazil's economic woes stem from inflation.   Sarney said his provisional measure _ the equivalent of apresidential decree _ goes into effect immediately and will forceunions to maintain a emergency work force in essential sectors suchas electricity, communications, hospitals, transportation, water,fuel distribution, ports and the Central Bank.   Workers in basic industries and services will have to give48-hour advance notice before walking out, he said.   As a third limitation, Sarney said strikes now must be approvedby one-third of the total union membership.   Sarney, Brazil's first civilian president after 21 years ofmilitary rule, said the government will release more details Friday.   Congress has 30 days to approve or reject his action. If itapproves, the provisional measure becomes law.   The president spoke as ports nationwide were idled for a secondday, union officials said, by a strike of 80,000 dock workers forhigher pay.   ``No ships are being loaded or unloaded at any port in thecountry,'' said Jose dos Santos, a union official at the port ofRio, Brazil's second-largest. The strike does not affect oilshipments because the state oil monopoly, Petrobras, has its ownloading terminals and separately unionized employees.   Workers want a standardized pay scale and a pay increase of 180percent to cope with inflation.   The right to strike for both public and private workers isguaranteed under Brazil's new constitution, approved by Congresslast October.   But Sarney cautioned Thursday night, ``When one goes beyond thelimits of the law, the road to force is opened.''   He said 8,790 strikes had been called during his four years inoffice, including 1,288 so far this year. He said 70 percent werein the public sector.   ``I never imagined that among other attempts to underminedemocracy there would be savage waves of strikes,'' said Sarney,who took office in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated byBrazil's top generals.   Failure of the Sarney government to curb 1,000-percent-a-yearinflation has led to strikes that hit ports, banks, the autoindustry and schools.   In January, the government announced its fourth anti-inflationprogram in three years to control wages and prices, cut governmentspending and eliminate up to 90,000 civil service jobs.   Inflation fell from 28.8 percent a month in December to 3percent for 11 days in February, but bounced back to 6 percent inMarch and was expected to wind up at 7 percent for April.   The government authorized pay increases of up to 18 percent inApril, unfroze some prices and created a system for 90-daycost-of-living adjustments.   But labor groups estimated that workers' buying power fell 49percent in the last year and threaten to call another generalstrike unless 50 percent pay raises are offered.   Leftist labor unions organized a two-day national strike toprotest the wage freeze. The strike was only partially successful,but strikes spread in April among teachers, bank workers,longshoremen and Rio city police.</TEXT></DOC>
