Then the ductile fracture test iscarried out and the distributions of SZW and {Delta}a are measured. Itis noted that {Delta}a is largest where phi, the angle from surface,is nearly 30deg. J integral distribution is evaluated by the finite elementmethod, and it is shown that the J value is also the largest where phiis nearly 30deg.</TEXT></DOC>
