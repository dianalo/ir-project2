That includes a smidgen of chromium to keepthings bright.   ``Drinking a sugary soda after eating a starchy meal and then icecream smothered with chocolate fudge can drain your body ofchromium,'' says the department's Agricultural Research Service.``And few of us get enough of this essential element as it is.''   Chromium keeps insulin levels in check by making the hormone moreefficient at regulating blood sugar levels, the agency said. And themore insulin secreted to process sugars from a meal, the morechromium the body uses and loses.   When there's not enough chromium, the body pumps out moreinsulin, said Richard A. Anderson, who specializes in chromiumresearch in the agency.   Few foods provide more than 10 percent to 15 percent of theminimum suggested intake or chromium, he said. A handful ofbreakfast cereals provide more than 25 percent.   And beer and wine are good sources of chromium.   Anderson recommends eating a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables,dairy and whole wheat products, and meat. Some foods and beverages,such as beer, pick up chromium from equipment during processing, hesaid. But other foods lose natural chromium in the refining process.   But for the most part it all boils down to common-sense adviceUSDA has in four new booklets designed to help Americans shop forfood, fix quick meals, eat out and snack.   Susan Welsh, director of nutrition education for the department'sHuman Nutrition Information Service, said Monday that agency studiesindicate consumers ``may be confused by, and weary of, seeminglyconflicting advice on what they should and shouldn't eat.''   The new effort, including the booklets, is intended to let peopleknow ``they can eat healthier without changing all their eatinghabits overnight or giving up their favorite foods,'' she said.   Among the common-sense advice is to eat a variety of food,maintain desirable weight and eat food with adequate starch andfiber. The agency suggests avoiding eating too much food with fat,saturated fat, sugar or sodium.   The suggestions are based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americansdeveloped by USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services in1980. The guidelines, slightly revised in 1985, are being reviewedfor further changes, possibly by 1991.   Booklets include:   _Preparing Foods and Planning Menus Using the Dietary Guidelines;$2.50, Item No. 172-V.   _Making Bag Lunches, Snacks and Desserts Using the DietaryGuidelines; $2.50, Item No. 173-V.   _Shopping for Food and Making Meals in Minutes Using the DietaryGuidelines; $3, Item No. 174-V.   _Eating Better When Eating Out Using the Dietary Guidelines;$1.50, Item No. 175-V.   The booklets may be ordered from: Consumer Information Center,Department 70, Pueblo, Colo., 81009.

Ronald J. Prucha, acting administrator of the department's FoodSafety and Inspection Servce, said Monday hogs and poultry from morethan 500 producers were sampled and none showed traces of heptachlor.   The testing began May 8 in Arkansas after illegally high levelsof the chemical were found in a Batesville poultry plant. Threeswine in the Batesville area in February and March were found tohave heptachlor traces, although only one had violative amounts _any amount more than 0.3 parts per million.   Contaminated feed has been mentioned frequently as a possiblesource of the chemical, and a number of feed mills have been underinvestigation.   Heptachlor was banned in 1978 by the Environmental ProtectionAgency for all agricultural uses except seed treatment. It has beenshown to cause tumors in laboratory mice.   Prucha said testing began in nine states surrounding Arkansas onMay 22, including: Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana,Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentuck and Illinois.   ``We're very encouraged by the results so far,'' he said.``However, we plan to continue testing for at least the next fewmonths.''   Prucha said no further decisions would be made until morecomplete results are ready.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two agricultural leaders from Israel and Egypthave been recognized by the Agriculture Department for their part incooperative programs aimed at improving world food production.   Recognition went to Egypt's Mohamed M. Dessouki, firstundersecretary for agricultural development of the ministry ofagriculture, and Prof. Samuel Pohoryles, director general of ruralplanning and development in Israel's ministry of agriculture.   They were among more than 40 people cited Monday by thedepartment's Office of International Cooperation and Development.Most work for the agency.   Other outsiders cited for efforts in international programsincluded: Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.; John Jordan and JohnWarren, both of Texas Aandamp;M University; and Thomas F. Trail ofWashington State University.   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said at the agency'sceremony that ``it's not hard to defend'' programs that enablecountries to cooperate in research and development projects.   ``We ought to support them for humanitarian motives alone,''Yeutter said. ``For those who find that difficult to do, forwhatever reason in terms of budgetary priorities, it seems to me wecan also defend them very readily in terms of economicself-interest,'' he said.   Yeutter added: ``We, the developed world, benefit from economicdevelopment in the developing countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
