The structures to be sold at auction would include office buildings, shopping centers and hotels, each with a minimum estimated market value of $5 million, for a total expected value of more than $100 million. Cushman andamp; Wakefield, a major real estate firm, said the properties haven't been chosen.    A Christie's spokeswoman said the reasoning behind the auction house's decision to move into the new area was that &quot;since it hasn't been done with prime commercial real estate and since we have the international marketing capability, it seemed like something worth trying.&quot;    Cushman andamp; Wakefield said the auction would &quot;benefit our clients by offering an additional marketing edge.&quot;    Unlike at most Christie's auctions, where both the sellers and the buyers pay 10% fees to the auctioneer, no fee will be paid to Christie's directly by either seller or buyer, the spokeswoman said. &quot;We have been retained by Cushman, and we have a special arrangement with them,&quot; she said.    A catalogue of the properties will be offered world-wide about six weeks before the auction, and potential buyers can request materials relating to properties that interest them. </TEXT></DOC>
