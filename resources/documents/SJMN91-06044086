Nowour guys can concentrate on North Coast. That's what we've been pointing toall season long anyway.&quot;;    Before the North Coast Section tournament Feb.22-23 at Sonoma State, the Colts wrestlers need to get through Saturday's MVALtournament at Irvington. That's where the also-rans will be weeded out. Thetop three finishers from each of the 13 weight divisions advance to the NCStournament.;    For now, Newark Memorial (7-0) is basking in its hard-fought27-18 victory over Logan (6-1) on Jan. 31.;    The victory was assured whenAngeja pulled a surprise by pinning Swain, who has been ranked among the top152-pounders in the section all season.;    &quot;That's when we knew we couldwin,&quot; said Nate Checketts, the Cougars' 160-pounder.;    Now, with a victoryover Mission San Jose (6-1) tonight, the Cougars can clinch their first leaguetitle since 1984-85.;    &quot;It's something we've been pointing to for a longtime,&quot; Checketts said of the Cougars, who have finished no worse than thirdthe past three seasons. &quot;We figure if we beat Logan, we can beat anyone.That's why Coach (Rich) Swift scheduled us against tough opponents all seasonlong.&quot;;    Despite the loss to Newark Memorial, Logan remains a strong threatat the MVAL tournament.;    &quot;We needed a good, close dual match,&quot; Logan CoachTom Rosenthal said. &quot;It was just like a college match. Low scoring and verygrueling. When you have a match that is decided by points in almost everymatch, you know you have two quality teams.;    &quot;It was tied at 18-18 withonly two matches left. When we lost, I didn't even mention the streak to thekids. I didn't think the kids needed that added pressure.&quot;;    That's becauseLogan's goal has been the same the last four seasons -- an NCS championship.The Colts have finished second, third, fourth and fifth at the section meetsince 1987.;    &quot;We've surrounded the top spot,&quot; Rosenthal said. &quot;The leaguetitle would have been nice, but we're really after something else. Maybe wecan start generating some steam again.&quot;;    Swift, not one to show hisemotions, appeared overjoyed after the Logan match.;    &quot;He was excited and hedeserved to be,&quot; Preisendorf said. &quot;Hell, I was excited, too. Everyone knowsthere's a situation between those two schools in wrestling. It's a greatrivalry. It was great to see Logan lose. You always want to see an underdogbecome an achiever.&quot;;    With eight non-seniors on the varsity, NewarkMemorial's future appears bright.;    &quot;They're one of the top programs aroundand sure it's great to beat them,&quot; Swift said. &quot;Logan's still got usdepthwise. If they lose a kid, they just slip another one in. If we lose one,it's 'uh, oh!' We've improved a lot from last year, but wrestling is a veryfragile sport and it doesn't take long for a program to fall apart.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PEDRO GOMEZ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910213  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  749  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 13, 199100044086,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
