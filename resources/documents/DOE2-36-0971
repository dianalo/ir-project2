Sludge treatment processes suchas gravity thickening, vacuum filter dewatering, and hauling and disposalwere also simulated. The primary objective of this work is to demonstratethat an optimization scheme can be used to determine the minimum totalcost of a complex physical-chemical treatment system with models representingthe individual unit processes. A method for determining the minimum costdesign of a physical-chemical treatment plant is presented. The methodutilizes an existing search technique (Box complex algorithm) to optimizea non-linear cost function for the physical-chemical processes. Thus,the physical-chemical treatment plant design is formulated as an optimizationproblem with non-linear cost functions and realistic mathematical modelsfor each of its constituent unit processes. The level of cost resolutionadopted derives from a series of economic models developed which basicallymake a Present Worth Analysis of each unit within the system. The economicdata are based mostly on updated cost information obtained from EnvironmentalProtection Agency Technology Transfer Manuals. Among the benefits directlyderived from this study are the following: optimum economic design andoperation of a typical physical-chemical treatment plant, simplifiedand directly oriented pilot plant studies, and the cost savings associatedwith it. Also, the formulation of a relatively new design concept isdeveloped which underlines the need of the simultaneous considerationof all the components of a physical-chemical treatment plant for themost economic design.</TEXT></DOC>
