Underground rock star Mikhail Naumenko had finallydrunk himself to death.;   To the mourners here, &quot;Mike&quot; Naumenko and hisplain-spoken anthems were something to believe in. Vladimir Lenin is a joke.Communism is a joke. Mikhail Gorbachev is a joke. The Young Pioneers, theYoung Communist League, the final exams in the Political Economy of Capitalismand Scientific Communism -- the whole curriculum is little more than an ironicprop.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CYNICAL SOVIET YOUTH SHUN POLITICS, EMBRACE ROCKTHEIR REBELLION IS AGAINST BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The coup's aftermath; See also related article on page 1A, 7A-8A of thissection.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;All someone has to do now is mention 'Uncle Lenin' and we all crack up,&quot;said a high school student named Lena Mironova. &quot;We grew up learning thealphabet with 'Lenin lessons' and then we read little tales of his life andwhat a good, studious boy he was. It's a joke. He's a joke.&quot;;   Apoliticalmotives;   For the young, politics is mainly a dead issue. Even stalwarts ofthe democracy movement like Boris Yeltsin and the city's mayor, AnatolySobchak, cannot be counted as great heroes. Young people here marched in thestreets against the junta because &quot;these were just idiots that couldn't betolerated,&quot; one of the mourners said. The coup's success would have meant theend of rock 'n' roll and of a Russian sexual revolution, of new businesses andnew money, the end of being young in a way their parents were never young.;  &quot;Rock music is the one thing we have that can open our eyes; it's somethingreal,&quot; said Dmitri Ustinov, a 17-year-old high school student. &quot;With all thejunk in our lives, all these clowns trying to tell us what to wear, what tosay, what to think, the music is something pure. It's ours. We weren't aboutto let them take it away. The night the coup fell apart, there was a hugeconcert called 'Rock Against Tanks' and rock won.&quot;;   A generation oftransition;   They are the Soviet Union's crossover generation, students andworkers in their late teens and 20s who lived under a system but were nevermuch part of it. By the time they were in school, the ideals of the Bolshevikpioneers were long dead. It was too late even to think about a reformedversion of socialism. Leonid Brezhnev was already a spluttering old man on TV,a perfect video symbol of the corrupt and the lost, and even Lenin in hismausoleum was known as &quot;the smoked fish.&quot;;   &quot;I'm sure my own children willnever be able to understand the world that we had in this country. It is as ifwe succeeded in creating a perfect hell,&quot; said Dmitri Dementyev, an18-year-old student of electronics.;   &quot;My grandmother is an ardent communistand she supported the junta right away. I didn't believe a word of this crapabout Gorbachev being sick. She believed it because she was brought up tobelieve in whatever she was told. Her own father was a big boss in theCommunist Party who was put away in a labor camp and shot during Stalin'stimes. But despite it all, she believes. It's incredible, but when I try toargue, she won't listen. How will anyone be able to understand this kind ofthinking?&quot;;   Searching for beliefs;   Lately, on sunny afternoons, Dementyevand his friends have been hanging around outside Kazan Cathedral on NevskyProspect -- a glorious building that was, until recently, the Museum ofAtheism. Some Americans have been handing out evangelical leaflets on thecathedral's steps and singing gospel songs.;   &quot;I listened very carefully,&quot;Dementyev said. &quot;I never would have listened before, but now it meanssomething, more and more. If anything moves in to replace the belief incommunism my grandmother had, it will be religion and real democracy. We wantRussia to be no more or less normal than France or Britain. We want Russia tobe like what it was before the revolution -- but democratic, not a monarchy.&quot;;  Leningrad was the hothouse of the Bolshevik revolution. And even though itlost its singular claim on politics when the capital moved to Moscow, it hasfor years been a center of young rebellion and subversive music.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID REMNICK, Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Leningrad, Ussr  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910904  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  715  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 4, 199100248194,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
