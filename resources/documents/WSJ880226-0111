In 1968, a presidential commission headed by Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner published a jolting report on the causes of the previous year's brutal inner-city riots. Its memorable conclusion: &quot;Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal.&quot;    While the Kerner Commission report provoked anger, it also raised hopes. Nearly two million copies were printed, and Robert Kennedy cited it as a reason for deciding to run for president. Recalls Vel Phillips, Milwaukee's first black city-council member: &quot;That report said to me this was going to be a better world for my two sons.&quot;    Twenty years later, however, the hopes remain largely unfulfilled. Although progress has been made in a number of areas, American society remains sharply divided between white and black. In the Kerner Commission's study, a torrent of statistics and testimony detailed the isolation and disrepair of the nation's mostly black central cities in 1968; many of those same statistical measures paint a depressingly similar picture today.    For instance, in 1968 the commission found that black unemployment was more than double that of whites. Today, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the ratio remains more than 2 to 1. In 1968, blacks' median income was 58% of the median income for whites. The latest figure: 58%.    In interviews, former members of the Kerner Commission express despair over the lack of progress. &quot;It would have been a nightmare to have thought things wouldn't change,&quot; says Katherine G. Peden, an industrial consultant in Louisville, Ky. But in two decades, she says, &quot;we haven't made much more than token advances.&quot;    Urban experts also point to an alarming number of violent racial incidents in recent years -- including the death of a black in New York's Howard Beach section -- as evidence of continued racial tensions. &quot;It was such a shock to many of us how bad things are,&quot; says Richard B. DeMars of Indianapolis, a white businessman and member of a task force trying to calm rising racial tensions there.    The Kerner Commission report -- its formal title was the Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders -- soon will again flare into public view. This weekend, on the eve of the report's 20th anniversary, a national conference in Racine, Wis., will issue a follow-up report on the original study. The conferees, including some former Kerner commissioners and staff members, are expected to conclude that the nation is still drifting apart into two unequal groups.    Few people deny that the plight of black Americans has improved in the past two decades. Among other things, the Kerner Commission report helped ease the way for black political power and, in particular, for vastly increased integration in the workplace. While in 1968 there were only two black mayors of big cities -- in Cleveland and Gary, Ind. -- today there are 17. And the black middle class has flourished in the past 20 years as opportunities in various professions have opened up. The growth of the national economy has brought greater prosperity to blacks as well as to whites.    But the relative status of blacks remains surprisingly unchanged. Black infants still die at a far higher rate than white infants do. Black policemen and executives still go home to largely black neighborhoods.    Urban experts say that much of the progress has been overshadowed by the growth of cities' black and, more recently, Hispanic underclass. Blacks, who live in the central cities in disproportionate numbers, have particularly suffered from the decline in manufacturing jobs there and from the movement of high-paying work to the suburbs. One study shows that between 1967 and 1982, the 12 major Northern cities lost 1.6 million jobs while their suburbs gained two million jobs.    The growth of the urban ghetto hardens racist feelings, say some scholars. &quot;This image of a dangerous inner city is generalized to the entire black population,&quot; says William Julius Wilson, a University of Chicago sociologist. &quot;Until we deal with the underclass, it will be impossible to have healthy race relations in this country.&quot;    Indeed, in the Chicago area, the number of racially motivated incidents rose in 1987 for the fourth consecutive year, according to the Chicago Reporter, a newsletter on racial issues. One of the more serious cases involved the firebombing of a black family's newly purchased home in a mainly white community.    In Indianapolis, Mayor William H. Hudnut recently formed a task force to study racial divisions exemplified by such incidents as the death of a 16-year-old black while in police custody. At the group's first meeting, a black minister told of recently being stopped by the police because he was driving a new Cadillac that they assumed he might have stolen.    In the Des Moines, Iowa, suburb of Clive, a local human-rights commission demanded the resignation of the police chief after local law-enforcement officers sent a notice to neighborhood groups telling them to call the police if they spotted a black man in their neighborhood &quot;so that we can try to find out who the individual is.&quot; The police suspected a black in a recent series of robberies.    Civil-rights leaders and urban scholars suggest a number of reasons for the continuing racial gulf. Urban experts point to the growing isolation of the urban ghetto and its problems. Others point to a presidential administration that they say has ignored the nation's racial problems. Still others suggest that the private sector has not done its share to further integration and to fully open opportunities for blacks.    Richard P. Nathan, a former Kerner Commission staff member who now teaches government at Princeton University, says that one of the Kerner report's biggest contributions was to help create &quot;a mood which made government's involvement with these urban problems more acceptable.&quot; But, he says, that mood didn't last. He notes that now, even in a presidential year, few candidates are addressing the deterioration of the nation's cities.    &quot;I guess we just have a feeling that since nothing's burning, things are OK,&quot; says former Sen. Fred Harris of Oklahoma, who was a member of the Kerner Commission. &quot;But we're having quiet riots. . . . There's a disparity between the way blacks and whites have progressed.&quot;    The flight of jobs and whites to the suburbs has, for example, led to continued segregation in the schools. Twenty years ago, according to the Kerner report, three-fourths of black grade-school pupils in the major cities attended schools with more than 90% minority students; today, according to a University of Chicago study, well over half of black pupils in the Chicago area attend such schools.    And although health statistics for black Americans show improvements, a wide gulf remains between whites and blacks in some areas. For instance, the Kerner report pointed out that the mortality rate for nonwhite infants under a month old was 58% higher than for white babies; according to the National Center for Health Statistics, the latest figures show that the discrepancy has climbed to 65%.    The nation, it seems, is continuing toward the kind of &quot;urban apartheid&quot; the Kerner Commission warned of, say urban experts. Those in the central city are becoming increasingly secluded from the rest of society and unable to move out. The Rev. Leon Sullivan, who wrote the Sullivan principles for American business investment in South Africa, says he has been urged by other black leaders to put together a similar set of principles for business investment in U.S. inner cities.    &quot;Cities have become viewed pretty much as a place where minorities and poor people live,&quot; says Richard G. Hatcher of Gary, who says the problems there in 1987, his last year as mayor of that predominantly black city, were more troublesome than those in his first year in 1967.    Mr. Hatcher and others suggest that the Reagan administration has ignored the worsening plight of blacks. According to a survey by the Joint Center for Political Studies, a think tank on black affairs, a growing number of blacks say they are becoming worse off under President Reagan. And for the first time in its 31-year history, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission is generally perceived as unfriendly by the black community. In fact, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has vigorously lobbied to stop financing of the agency.    The agency's chairman, Clarence Pendleton Jr., who is himself black, says that civil-rights leaders have to stop relying on the federal government for answers. &quot;Blacks,&quot; he says, &quot;are not a separate nation requiring separate treatment from any administration.&quot;    Miss Peden, the former Kerner commissioner from Louisville, partly blames the business community for blacks' plight. Three years ago, she watched a black-owned bank in Louisville fail. &quot;I thought with so many blacks here,&quot; she says, &quot;some emphasis should have been given to keeping it afloat.&quot;    Her biggest disappointment over the past two decades is &quot;that we don't have more blacks in management and the financial area; I just seldom see in the industrial world a black plant manager, but on the assembly line you see blacks.&quot;    Some doors of opportunity appear to be closing. The percentage of black college-bound high-school graduates is smaller now than it was in 1971, says the American Council on Education. A recent study by the Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington, D.C., found that in the capital area blacks face a better than even chance of racial discrimination when trying to rent an apartment. And the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reports a 60% increase in housing-discrimination complaints in the past eight years.    Certainly, American society has moved some distance from the tinderbox of racial tensions that existed 20 years ago. But the Kerner Commission's recommendations -- the creation of new jobs, the elimination of de facto segregation in the schools, enforceable federal open-housing laws and the building of affordable housing for the poor -- continue to be major issues.    A private national housing task force is expected to issue a report next month calling for a recommitment to providing affordable housing. Connecticut's commissioner of education has called for the integration of suburban with central-city schools in his state, and there have been demands for his resignation. Congress is about to consider a bill that would strengthen the 1968 open-housing law; similar legislation was rejected in 1980.    For Milwaukee's Mrs. Phillips, the Kerner report's dire warning that the nation might break apart into two unequal societies lingers like a painful, shrill echo. Since announcing in October her plans to run for Congress -- she would be the first black representative from the Milwaukee area -- she says she has received threatening phone calls telling her, &quot;You bitch, go back to South Africa.&quot;    As she picks up one of her two Kerner reports, a folded, weather-beaten copy of a Langston Hughes poem flutters to the floor. It reads, in part: This dream . . . today embattled With its back against the wall To save the dream for one It must be saved for all.    ---                      Two Decades Later                               WHITES          BLACKS Unemployment   1967                         3.4%            7.4%   1988 (January)               5.8%           12.2% Median Income for households   1967                        $7,449          $4,325   1986                       $26,175         $15,080 Mortality of Infants under one month  (per 1,000 live births)   1965                        16.1            25.4*   1984                         6.2            10.2* *All nonwhites Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; U.S. Census; National Center for Health Statistics</TEXT></DOC>
