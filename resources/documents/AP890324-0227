The company, which is based in Brea, Calif., also will pay$200,000 to cover what it cost New York, California, Massachusetts,Minnesota, Missouri, Texas and Washington to brings suits accusingSuzuki of false and deceptive advertising. The agreement wasannounced Thursday.   In the settlement, which took effect Tuesday, the company made noadmission of guilt or safety problems.   Safety of the Samurai came into question last June after ConsumerReports magazine gave the four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle arating of ``not acceptable.'' It said the Samurai was too short,narrow, light and high-riding to be safe and that it rolled over ina routine obstacle-avoidance test.   Consumers Union, publisher of the magazine, asked the NationalHighway Traffic Safety Administration to recall the more than150,000 Samurais sold in the United States since its introduction inNovember 1985.   The federal safety agency declined to recall the car, saying inSeptember that the Samurai rollover rate was ``within the range ofmost other light utility vehicles.''   N. Douglas Mazza, vice president of the car company, issued astatement that said the agreement with the seven states ``affirmsthat the Samurai is a safe vehicle and strongly supports the federalgovernment decision that there is no reason to investigate thesafety of the Samurai.''   While Suzuki is bound, under the settlement, to include thewarning in ads shown or published only in the seven states involvedin the case, the company said it would be included in all nationaladvertising.   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said Thursday that thestates took action because ``the federal government has, once again,failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.''   He said that under the settlement, Suzuki's print ads will haveto include the statement: ``This vehicle handles differently fromordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turnsand abrupt maneuvers which can cause vehicles of this type to rollover. Always wear your seatbelt. For specific details, please readyour owner's manual.''   A shorter version of the statement is required for television andradio ads, Abrams said.</TEXT></DOC>
