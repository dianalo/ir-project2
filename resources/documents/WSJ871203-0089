Industry officials close to the transaction said American Capital, a thrift holding company, is negotiating with the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. on a complicated proposal to take over Beach. Beach was created by regulators to house deposits and some sound assets of Boynton Beach Fla.-based Sunrise Savings andamp; Loan, which collapsed in July 1985 amid allegations of massive fraud.    It isn't clear whether the proposal will include a new infusion of government cash. The FSLIC has already taken reserves against huge losses stemming from the takeover of Sunrise's bad assets. FSLIC deficits from Sunrise's demise are likely to total $700 million, which would be the most expensive thrift fiasco to date. Beach currently has about $1.2 billion of assets. American Capital has about $5.5 billion.    American Capital officials declined comment. A spokeswoman for Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, also declined to comment.    Any deal to unload Beach would underscore the escalating pace at which regulators are trying to cope with billions of dollars of deferred losses, piled up since the early 1980s, at thrifts wrecked by interest rate rises and fraud. Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall has said repeatedly that he intends to start facing up to the losses, even though most thrift experts don't think FSLIC has enough money to sop up all the red ink. The fund was pulled out of a liquidity crisis when Congress passed a $10.8 billion recapitalization plan in August, but some estimates of the eventual clean-up costs range as high as $25 billion.    Two weeks ago, regulators pumped a record $1.3 billion into Vernon Federal Savings andamp; Loan, Dallas, but it isn't clear yet how much of that will be lost. And regulators still have scores of sick thrifts to deal with, including Stockton, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America, which some thrift industry officials believe could cost the government well over $1 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
