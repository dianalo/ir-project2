The cut would represent a reduction of slightly less than 3percent of its U.S. work force if all the cuts came in the UnitedStates. Accounting for some of the cuts is the closing of anobsolete wafer fabrication plant in Dallas.   Texas Instruments said it would take a pre-tax charge againstearnings of about $55 million in the fourth quarter. About $25million covers the cost of cuts and upgrades in the semiconductorbusiness, while the rest is split evenly between cost reductions inthe information technology group and cost adjustments onfixed-price defense contracts.   The move came later on a day in which the company announced inJapan that it will hire several hundred Japanese scientists andengineers for a new research and development center in Tsukuba,about 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.   Texas Instruments spokeswoman Terri West said the company plansto seek the job reduction as much as possible through voluntarymeans, such as retirements, early retirements (at age 55),voluntary terminations and ``bridged early retirements'' (for thoseyounger than 55).   Two similar reduction efforts earlier this year resulted inabout 2,000 jobs being trimmed from the firm's corporate anddefense systems groups.   The company has about 75,000 employees worldwide, with about51,000 of those in the United States. About 80 percent of the U.S.workforce is concentrated in Texas.   Reductions will be sought within information technology groupoperations in Hunt Valley, Md.; Johnson City, Tenn.; North Texas;and the Texas cities of Austin Temple and Houston.   Semiconductor group reductions will be asked in Dallas.   Voluntary reductions will be sought among materials and controlgroups personnel at Attlesboro, Mass., and Versaille, Ky.   Specific targets at each facility are being withheld, Ms. Westsaid.   The cutbacks in materials and controls group are necessarybecause of a weakness in the appliance market and a slowness in theautomotive market, TI officials said in a statement explaining thepre-tax charge.</TEXT></DOC>
