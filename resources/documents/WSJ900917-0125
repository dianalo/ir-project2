West Germany's package of assistance, considerably morethan Washington had sought, may have silenced U.S. criticswho had derisively compared Bonn's reluctance to providesignificant help for the Gulf with its agreement last week topay the Soviets some 12 billion marks (about $7.5 billion) tofinance their troop withdrawal from East Germany. West Germanofficials increased the size of the aid to send a clearmessage that they intended to accept the responsibilities oftheir growing international role.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Without doubt, a Germany that has 17 million moreinhabitants (raising its population to nearly 80 million)will have greater weight -- politically and economically,&quot;said West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher inan interview shortly before Mr. Kohl announced his decision.&quot;The future will show what is already clear now -- that theunification of Germany doesn't create a problem but ratherthat it helps to solve other problems.&quot;   Bonn's decision to provide more money for the Gulf,however, was as much a response to international pressure asa considered strategy. A wide range of political agreementswith the Soviet Union in recent weeks have left criticswondering whether Bonn wasn't forgetting other obligations.   West Germany still won't send combat troops to the Gulf,citing constitutional restrictions, but it has compensatedwith a string of other measures. It will provide 1.6 billionmarks in direct financial help to the U.S. and a billionmarks for military equipment including vehicles, radioequipment, water tankers, cranes and equipment to protectsoldiers against chemical attack. West Germany also willprovide aid to countries that have been hardest-hit by thetrade embargo and the resultant flood of refugees: 400million marks in aid to Egypt, 200 million marks to Jordanand 110 million marks to Turkey.   Many countries now appear eager to accept a moreinfluential Germany. The end of the Cold War, Soviet economicdecline and the growing U.S. budgetary constraints have leftmany countries in the world knocking on Bonn's door forassistance.   Soviet officials, who are betting on Germany's assurances,have made Germany's political ascendance all the more certainby proposing that the country, after its unification on Oct.3, become the sixth permanent member of the United NationsSecurity Council. Germany should return to world politics asa &quot;modern great power,&quot; said Nikolai Portugalov, the Germanaffairs adviser to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.   The rapid changes of recent months have left Mr. Genscher,the world's longest-serving foreign minister (16 years), withthe task of designing policies to maximize his country'sinfluence while reducing any apprehensions about a resurgentGermany. In a wide-ranging interview in his office next tothe Rhine, talking over the sound of cargo ships passing bythe window, he coined a phrase to describe the evolvingapproach: &quot;policy by example.&quot;   &quot;Setting an example is the opposite of striving forpower,&quot; he said, musing about the future with fivejournalists from five countries.   In outlining his priorities, Mr. Genscher said Germanywould &quot;set an example&quot; in the following ways:   -- European Union: He wants his neighbors to think moreabout European integration and worry less about German power.Mr. Genscher's goal is still to create a common Europeancurrency at the same time as a single European market,despite recent reservations expressed by West Germany'scentral bank president and finance minister. &quot;We won't getall the advantages of the power of a single market if we allhave different economic, currency and finance policies,&quot; saidMr. Genscher. He said West Germany's economic miracle nevercould have happened if not for the decision of the threeWestern occupying powers in 1948 to create a single currencyfor their occupation zones. Mr. Genscher said he wouldcampaign for the establishment of a European Central Bank inFrankfurt.   -- Eastern Europe: He said Germany, with its Westernpartners, would endeavor to prevent new economic divisionsfrom replacing the old ideological divisions. However,Western diplomats say Mr. Genscher is unhappy that othercountries haven't provided more in the way of financing. &quot;Wedon't want to monopolize policies toward Eastern Europe,&quot; hesaid.   -- The U.S.: Perhaps as early as October, Mr. Genscherwould like European Community foreign ministers to work out a&quot;trans-Atlantic declaration&quot; with the U.S. It would be astatement of principles, not unlike the one reached betweenthe Soviet Union and Germany early this year, that woulddefine the European-U.S. relationship for the future. Itsintention also would be to focus Washington more on ties withthe European Community instead and not just individualcountries.   -- The Soviet Union: Mr. Genscher derides those who stillharbor any suspicions about Bonn's relationship with theSoviet Union or unduly question the large amounts of aid thecountry has been willing to pay to gain Moscow's agreement tounification and troop withdrawal. He said Western officialswho have worried that Germany would sell out to the Soviet&quot;have grown gray and retired.&quot; He cautioned againstcontinuing to view Europe politically in terms of East andWest. &quot;We have to be careful when looking into the future notto use yesterday's vocabulary,&quot; he says.   Does Mr. Genscher fear that his vision of Germany and itsrole in a unified Europe might be lost if he disappears fromthe scene? He's confident Bonn's policies will be continued.Pointing to opinion polls that consistently rank him the mostpopular of West German politicians, he says: &quot;It isn'tbecause of my good looks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
