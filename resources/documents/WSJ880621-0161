It is as much a gentle chiding of his above-the-fray comportment as a reverent acknowledgement of his political skills.    But in recent weeks, Mr. Mitterrand has shown signs of losing his divine touch -- his own reelection last month notwithstanding. His political miscues contributed to his Socialist Party's failure to win a parliamentary majority this month. To extricate himself, he will need to recover all his legendary political savvy. Nobody is counting Mr. Mitterrand out. He is at his best in difficult situations. But expanding his power base beyond the Socialist Party and realigning French politics around the center-left will require real political will as well as deftness at string-pulling.    The stakes are high, not only for the 71-year-old president but for France. If he builds his coalition, it will mean stable consensus government and growing French influence in Europe and the world. If he fails, France risks political paralysis.    Mr. Mitterrand's fallibility began to appear a few days after his impressive presidential victory May 8, when the Socialist Party elected popular Pierre Mauroy as its leader over Mr. Mitterrand's choice, the more aloof Laurent Fabius. The move marked the first time in memory that Mr. Mitterrand failed to impose his viewpoint on the party he built.    A more important sign of weakness came on June 12 when French voters rejected Mr. Mitterrand's calls for a &quot;clear, if not excessive,&quot; Socialist legislative majority. Instead, they gave no one a majority. Mr. Mitterrand appointed a minority Socialist government that will have to negotiate support in parliament either with the centrists or the Communists.    This standoff, following two years of forced &quot;cohabitation&quot; between the Socialist president and a right-dominated parliament, is unprecedented in the 30-year-old Fifth Republic. It is also partly Mr. Mitterrand's doing. It was he who dissolved parliament, despite a campaign promise to try first to govern with the old, conservative-dominated legislature. So sure was he of victory that he opened the campaign by saying that it &quot;isn't healthy that one party govern France,&quot; implying that, after the Socialists won the election, they would try to &quot;open up&quot; to other parties.    Things aren't as unstable as they seem. Vacation season is starting and Mr. Mitterrand can hobble along awhile with a minority government. But lasting, stable government will require broadening out to a true alliance with the centrists. And that means overcoming decades of animosity. So far, neither side has been willing to make the sacrifices required.    Part of the problem is personal. Mr. Mitterrand and leaders of the center-right have been bitter political foes for decades. Two leading center-right proponents of cooperation, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, would like to succeed Mr. Mitterrand when his presidential term ends. Neither wants to give him a free hand, and he doesn't want to give them too much room to maneuver, either.    There are other obstacles. Center-right legislators were elected on a platform of opposition to Mr. Mitterrand and the Socialists. They would look like turncoats if they cooperated too closely with him too quickly. And Socialists can't appear to jettison the vestiges of left-wing ideas in their program.    The fundamental problem is that an alliance can't just be a few centrist politicians rallying to the Socialists to give them a technical majority. It has to be a negotiated union, requiring cooperation that doesn't yet exist.    Such an alliance isn't impossible. In recent years, a consensus has developed in France over most aspects of foreign, defense and even economic policy. The public wants a broad center-left government; the politicians say they do, too. If there ever was a time when coalition government should work, it appears to be now.    But France's track record with coalition governments has been disastrous, notably during the turbulent revolving-door governments of the 1950s. This time, conditions for success are better, though the task remains daunting. Mr. Mitterrand must show that &quot;opening up&quot; isn't a ploy to consolidate his power, but a genuine ambition that would allow him to make a lasting mark on French politics. </TEXT></DOC>
