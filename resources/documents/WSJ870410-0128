Wojciech Jaruzelski, his resolve strengthened by Mikhail Gorbachev's vision of modern socialism, is about to attempt a fundamental restructuring of his country's feeble economy.    His central planners, who have resisted earlier efforts at reform, are again proving difficult. And it's too early to say where the economic debate that the general has launched will lead -- if anywhere.    But what's striking is that the deliberations about the shape of the shakeup are being carried on in almost full public view -- and that revolutionary ideas are being put forward not by renegade economists on the sidelines but by specialists appointed by the Communist regime itself.    Only the dreamiest economic thinkers talk of selling off the state's huge assets, but beyond that some of the proposals being put forward here wouldn't seem out of place before British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. Mixed enterprises, bankruptcies, higher pay for harder work, banking competition, and the sale of stocks and bonds are a few elements likely to appear in a prospectus for reform expected from the government soon, perhaps within weeks.    As in the Soviet Union, change would come from the top; the Communist Party would retain ultimate control over the economy. But in Poland, the possibilities under discussion could make for greater market orientation than has existed even in Hungary, the most economically liberal East European nation.    &quot;This will involve a rational reformation of the 'center,' particularly the economic center,&quot; Gen. Jaruzelski said in a speech late last month. It will produce &quot;significant reductions in the number of higher-level managerial positions. We will show greater firmness toward the sluggish, the lenient, those pursuing conservative habits and those who do not understand the reform.&quot;    In some other countries of the East Bloc, notably East Germany and Czechoslovakia, talk of loosening the center's control has long been deemed subversive.    The notion makes Czech leaders, who are sweating through a visit from Mr. Gorbachev this week, especially antsy; they came to power 19 years ago after Russian tanks made short work of a renewal much more sweeping than -- but in some ways similar to -- the one the Russians now espouse.    Polish leaders still cling to power. But Polish workers have never taken direction well. Every upheaval here over the past three decades has followed an attempt to make the economy coherent by raising prices. Poles resist, insisting on a say in the matter. But democracy has never been, and may never be part of the deal.    Poland last set off on this road to reform in 1982. Backed by martial law, the government put into place changes accepted under pressure from Solidarity, the independent trade union it had just crushed. Companies gained a measure of autonomy, wages and incentives had their first encounter, and prices took some note of the market. Westerners considered it the most ambitious East European reorganization ever. It promptly flopped.    The predictable reason: Enterprises couldn't wriggle free from the strict control of central ministries. &quot;All dynamism vanished,&quot; says Jan Mujzel, a prominent economist. The authorities tried to explain that they had switched to &quot;a strategy of small steps,&quot; but few believed them. The public, Prof. Mujzel believes, blamed the decline of living standards on an outmoded system in need of radical change.    The price-rise ritual was repeated only last week. The government moved to increase food prices by 13%. The remnants of Solidarity, as usual, called for strikes.    But this time, even the official Communist-controlled union was fed up. It forced the finance minister to cut the increases down to less than 10%.    &quot;Price increases don't balance the market and they don't stop inflation,&quot; says the union spokesman, Franciszek Ciemny. &quot;We want across-the-board changes. Take the tax system. It's completely incongruous. What's the sense of competing with your fellow man when basic things are wrong?&quot;    By granting &quot;certain demands,&quot; said Finance Minister Bazyli Samojlik, the government hopes to &quot;release the productive energies of society&quot; in its coming campaign.    This time, those hopes may have some foundation. &quot;Conservative forces are very much weakened by changes in the Soviet Union,&quot; says Prof. Mujzel, a member of the government's commission of economic reform. &quot;Never has Poland had such an opportunity.&quot;    Prof. Mujzel and some of his government colleagues have painted a picture of the future Poland that looks curiously like a mixed economy. Jerzy Osiatynski, another commission member, wants to make the state sector work better by &quot;surrounding it with more efficient firms.&quot;    &quot;We need bolder moves toward creating a diversified ownership pattern of the economy, enabling the development of not only private enterprises but also authentic cooperatives, municipal companies and mixed capital companies run by banks and enterprises,&quot; he has written in the official press.    Central planners, he argues, should confine themselves to broad economic issues, and to building things like roads and telephone lines. Zdzislaw Sadowski, chairman of the Polish Economic Society, goes a bit further. He wants to modify the cherished principal of &quot;social property&quot; to free companies from direct state control. The state, he suggests, could &quot;entrust&quot; a factory to, say, an insurance company, which would expect to run it at a profit.    &quot;I have no doubt that we will see bankruptcies and unemployment,&quot; Prof. Mujzel says. Neither the planners nor the workers will like that; to control the planners and mollify the workers, he can think of only one tool: democracy. That means giving workers a strong say in management, and making trade unions independent.    &quot;Without democracy, it will be extremely difficult to get the people's support for tough economic measures,&quot; Prof. Mujzel says. &quot;Reform requires much harder conditions for all working people. You have to pay something for their help.&quot;    And that is where his optimism fades. A draft plan, presented to the reform commission last month and hotly debated for seven hours, barely touched on economic and political democracy. It mentioned worker control only twice, in passing. And a report on the meeting published this week says the draft was equally silent about diluting the power of the central planners.    Once the shape of reform is agreed upon, moreover, the draft reportedly puts off the implementation of its more sweeping elements until after 1990. That apparently infuriated many of the commission's 22 members. Jerzy Osiatynski was reported to say: &quot;What we need are changes -- concrete, principled and quick.&quot;    More disheartening, perhaps, was a proposal slipped into the draft for a task force to implement the reform. All but one of the commission members spoke out in opposition. The task force, it seems, would be manned by delegates from government ministries and the planning commission -- precisely those who stand to have their formidable power taken away. </TEXT></DOC>
