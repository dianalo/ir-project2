An FDA spokesman said federal prosecutors have subpoenaedFDA employees to provide files and other documents over thepast few weeks.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Fourteen or 15 people have received subpoenas,&quot; said asenior FDA official. &quot;Some are in the field and some are inheadquarters.&quot;   The grand jury investigation, first reported by syndicatedcolumnist Jack Anderson, is trying to determine whether FDAemployees leaked confidential information to outsideinvestors or whether the employees themselves traded on thepotentially market-moving information.   FDA and law enforcement officials stressed that therecipients of the subpoenas weren't necessarily underinvestigation. &quot;The fact that information is being collecteddoesn't mean FDA employees are targets,&quot; said Jeff Nesbit,the agency spokesman.   Pharmaceutical companies' stock can rise or fall onnew-drug approvals, and consequently the FDA's decisions areeagerly awaited by Wall Street. A spokeswoman for theSecurities and Exchange Commission, citing a longstandingagency policy, would neither confirm nor deny that the SEC isparticipating in the investigation.   The grand jury probe follows a 1988 scandal involvinggeneric-drug approvals, in which FDA officials were found tohave accepted money and gifts from the companies whose drugsthey were reviewing. Federal prosecutors are stillinvestigating allegations of fabricated test data anddeficient manufacturing practices in the generic drugindustry.   The new probe is separate from the generic drug inquiry,although both are being led by Gary Jordan, first assistantU.S. attorney in Baltimore.</TEXT></DOC>
