In interviews this week, senior corporate lending officersat a majority of the dozen largest U.S. banks said they don'texpect to ease credit standards later this year, even if theeconomy begins to rebound. The bankers also expect loan feesand pricing terms, which have increased substantially in thepast year, to remain high or even go higher.</LP><TEXT>   In a typical assessment, James B. Lee, a managing directorof Chemical Banking Corp., said: &quot;Chemical will not berelaxing its standards. . . . We're in a new period here,where banks are demanding and getting better structures andbetter pricing. I think this period could be quitesustainable.&quot;   All the bankers interviewed said they are willing to makenew loans to creditworthy companies, but several expressedfears that the banking system overall may be unable to supplysufficient credit for a rapid economic recovery. The reasonis that many banks are struggling to meet new internationalcapital standards that will take effect at the end of nextyear, and are limiting loan growth as a result.   &quot;I don't know to what extent the capacity of the system tofinance the desired pace of the recovery is as strong as we'dall like it to be,&quot; said Richard Boyle, vice chairman ofChase Manhattan Corp. Because of big recent losses at manybanks, &quot;you've got a lower level and an increased level of{capital} requirement within the system,&quot; Mr. Boyle said.&quot;You could hit a limit to capacity,&quot; he added.   &quot;All banks have a closer eye on their capital ratio,&quot; saidChemical's Mr. Lee. &quot;For go-go banking to reappear, I thinkyou need two important things: The U.S. economy has to turn acorner and be clearly in a build mode, and all the world'sbanks have to have gone further down the path of establishingthe right capital structure for their strategies,&quot; Mr. Leesaid.   Though some big banks expect their problem loans andloan-loss provisions to peak at mid-year, it will takeseveral quarters -- if not years -- for many banks to rebuildthe capital they have lost on commercial real estate anddeveloping-country loans.   Most of the bankers interviewed said they haven't yet seenan increase in loan demand since the end of the war withIraq, although one banker said he has seen an increase inrequests to finance corporate acquisitions.   The &quot;credit crunch&quot; and the extent to which regulatorycrackdowns may have contributed to it has been much debatedin recent months, especially in Washington. The FederalReserve Board accelerated its own quarterly survey of seniorlending officers, and expects to release the results within10 days.   The Fed's most recent survey of lending officers,conducted in January, indicated that about one-third of thebanks surveyed were tightening credit standards, and nonewere loosening.   Because most economists are already expecting the recoveryto be slower than average, a continued tough lending stanceby banks may not come as a surprise. David Klein, aneconomist at PaineWebber Inc., says that firm is expectinginflation-adjusted economic growth of about 3% in the first12 months after the recovery begins, compared with 5.5%average growth during the first year of previous recoveries.   Based on studies of the Fed's lending surveys in previousrecessions and recoveries, Mr. Klein said a recovery canbegin when the net number of banks tightening creditstandards falls to 25% or less of the total. &quot;Once a majorityof the banks stop tightening, it does seem that that'sactually enough, in past credit crunches,&quot; to allow arecovery to begin, Mr. Klein said.   Still, bankers themselves tend to be pessimistic about thebanking system's ability to fuel a recovery. &quot;I don't expectthat the banks' appetite for credit will help the recovery,&quot;said Robert Bourke, senior vice president of First ChicagoCorp. &quot;I think the banks remain very cautious about adding alot of assets&quot; such as loans, he said.   &quot;I think everybody is concerned about having adequatecapital and in an environment that remains soft in terms ofbanks' earnings, the one way you can improve the ratio is bywatching the banks assets,&quot; Mr. Bourke said. &quot;I expect thatto continue in the foreseeable future.&quot;   The bankers were unanimous in their view that loan pricingwill remain firm. Even bankers who said they had nottightened credit standards over the past said they hadcharged higher up-front loan fees and set rates at biggerspreads over reference rates such as the prime rate or Londonmoney-market rates.   &quot;Pricing has gone up very substantially&quot; on loans tohighly leveraged corporate acquisitions, said Robert O'Brien,a managing director of Bankers Trust New York Corp., whoadded that there is &quot;a clear trend toward higher pricing inthe industry&quot; for all types of loans. &quot;I think that willprobably continue,&quot; Mr. O'Brien said, because banks&quot;certainly want to get paid for the risk they're taking.&quot;   Christopher Snyder, president of Loan Pricing Corp., whichtracks loan sales and syndications, said spreads on loans tohighly rated corporations had increased from about 0.16percentage point over the London interbank offered rate toabout 0.3 percentage point. Fees have increased as much as afull percentage point of the loan amount, he said.   Said Mark G. Solow, a group executive at ManufacturersHanover Corp. in charge of the bank's corporate lendingrelationships: &quot;We've clearly gotten tougher on pricing andI'm real happy about that.&quot; Though Mr. Solow saidManufacturers Hanover is &quot;looking to underwritetransactions,&quot; he added: &quot;I'd rather lose a piece of businessthan give it away.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
