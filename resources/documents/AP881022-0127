The amendments also would give Serbia more control over itsautonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. The crisis has beenfueled by hundreds of thousands of Serbs protesting the allegedharassment of Serbs in Kosovo by the majority ethnic Albanians.   Adoption of the 34 measures was largely symbolic, since strongopposition is expected when they are submitted to for approval bythe legislatures of each of Yugoslavia's six republics and twoprovinces.   The government meanwhile approved price increases of up to 53percent on meat and 60 percent on bread, two days after Parliamenteased an unpopular austerity program by allowing salary raises forsome workers.   The wage increases of between 140 percent and 152 percent forthis year will only partially compensate for falling livingstandards because inflation is now at 217 percent.   Meat prices were boosted just three weeks ago. Last year, thegovernment had to cancel sharp increases in bread prices afterwidespread protests.   The economic amendments were designed to help ease a crisis thathas reduced living standards by one-half since 1980.   They provide for less state interference, greater private andforeign investment and more market mechanisms in the economy, suchas closing unprofitable enterprises and sacking unnecessary orundisciplined workers.   The moves to give Serbia more control over Vojvodina and Kosovoand a controversial proposal for army financing are likely to meetparticularly stiff resistance in regional legislatures.   Serbia would increase its control over Kosovo's largely ethnicAlbanian judiciary, which Serbs contend is biased against them.   The reforms also would require Kosovo pupils to study accordingto programs drawn up in Serbia. The object is to broaden thenon-Albanian cultural background given to ethnic Albanian pupils.   Kosovo and Vojvodina, administratively parts of the republic ofSerbia, have strenuously resisted Serbian communist leader SlobodanMilosevic's efforts to curtail their autonomy.   Serbs have held dozens of massive rallies to voice their supportfor the constitutional reforms in the past five months, andVojvodina's party leadership was forced to resign this month overthe issue.   The amendments also would allow the budget of the armed forcesto be replenished from funds of the republics in case of ashortfall in the federal budget.   The liberal northern republic of Slovenia has refused to endorsethe proposal.   The army, which now is financed from the federal budget, longhas complained that triple-digit inflation is eating into its fundsand forcing it to take out loans from state banks to enable it tocontinue operating.   The constitutional proposals would amend about one-third ofYugoslavia's 1974 constitution, said to be the world's longest with406 articles.   The amendments, due to be adopted by republican and provinciallegislatures by Nov. 29, the national holiday, are seen as aninterim solution before a ``new and modern'' constitution isdrafted, the state news agency Tanjug said.   Stipe Suvar, who holds the annually rotating chairmanship of theruling Communist party, said last week a new draft constitution maybe ready for discussion by the next national party congress in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
