In response to the worst oil spill in North American history,lawmakers are scrutinizing federal statutes related to oiltransportation so no future spill is allowed to get so far out ofcontrol.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has introducedlegislation that would require the president to immediatelyinitiate a cleanup of oil spills unless he is sure the owner oroperator of the vessel is doing it.   President Bush announced Friday he was sending the military toValdez to help clean up, but Mitchell was angry that he waiteduntil two weeks after the March 24 accident to take any action.   ``A federal takeover of the cleanup effort was warranted afterit became clear on the day of the accident that Alyeska (the oilpipeline service company) and Exxon had not responded in the mannercalled for by the contingency plan and did not have sufficientequipment available to contain the spill,'' Mitchell said.   His proposal would set up a $500 million federal fund to pay forthe spills when those responsible can't be found.   Both Mitchell's bill and one offered by Sen. Max Baucus,D-Mont., are amendments to the Clean Water Act.   Baucus is proposing that minimum penalties for spilling oil beincreased from $5,000 to $50,000 and, in the case of big spills, to$50 per barrel. That would have slapped a multi-million dollar fineon Exxon for the Valdez accident.   House Republicans also are working on legislation to improvereadiness for oil tanker accidents, but don't want the federalgovernment to get stuck with the bill.   The measure being designed by the House Republican ResearchCommittee would require industry to be more specific aboutemergency response plans and have more equipment ready, as well asto pay for all the costs of cleanup.   Legislation proposed by Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., wouldconsolidate four federal laws on who gets blamed and billed fordamage caused by spills.   His proposal also would increase liability, the categories forwhich compensation should be paid and the size of the fund formaking compensation. Money for the fund would come from a1.3-cent-per-barrel fee on crude oil sold in the United States.   Jones' subcommittee on the Coast Guard will be working onlegislation reauthorizing that service and likely will make changesreflecting reaction to the Valdez disaster, said a staff member ofthe subcommittee.   Cornel Martin noted that the bill could be a vehicle forstrengthening rules against alcohol consumption by tanker crews, orrequiring more extensive background checks on those renewing theirpilot's licenses.   The pilot of the Exxon Valdez, who was in his cabin when thetanker ran aground, admitted drinking before the accident and, as amotorist, had a history of driving while intoxicated arrests. Hehas been charged in the accident.   Both Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Rep. Silvio Conte,R-Mass., have introduced bills that would give the Coast Guardaccess to the Federal National Driver Register to check on drivingrecords of potential tanker pilots.   Lawmakers opposed to oil exploration in the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge say there's not much chance of legislation passingthat would allow drilling in that environmentally sensitive Alaskanregion.   ``ANWR is dead for the foreseeable future,'' said Sen. TimothyWirth, D-Colo.   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who supports ANWR drilling,disagrees.   ``It is too early too tell what the impact will be,'' he said.``We will have to assess not only what the damage is, but ways toprevent this kind of accident in the future and to assure thepublic that can be done. The spill does not reduce our need foroil.''   Bush's budget for fiscal 1990 assumed the treasury would get$2.1 billion from oil lease sales in the refuge.   Since the Valdez disaster, White House and congressional budgetnegotiators have decided the money won't be available.</TEXT></DOC>
