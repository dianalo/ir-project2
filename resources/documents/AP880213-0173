Roger Wilkins, deputy general secretary of the National Union ofSeamen, said he expected the workers to approve the agreement withthe Isle of Man Steam Packet Co. and return to work Sunday.   The strike, begun at the end of December, led to a nationwidewalkout Feb. 2 that crippled ferry service at 12 ports. The HighCourt ruled the strike illegal.   Union leader Sam McCluskie had ordered men who were striking insupport of their Isle of Man colleagues to return to work, but saidother seamen striking because of their own local grievances couldstay out.   Sealink company crews at the ports of Holyhead, Liverpool andFleetwood, and P and O crews at Dover, have remained on strike. Theagreement would not affect their walkout.   Wilkins said management, which had wanted to lay off 80 of its161 crewmen in economy moves, agreed to fire 47.   ``I think the members will accept it, because we have got thebest possible deal in the circumstances,'' Wilkins said.</TEXT></DOC>
