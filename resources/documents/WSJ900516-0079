U.S. district Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York statecourt Justice Helen Freedman also raised the possibility thatthey may order drastic measures to ensure that the trust andManville more rapidly pay damages to asbestos victims.</LP><TEXT>   The two judges, in a joint memorandum, said these stepscould include requiring Manville to pay additional funding tothe trust and opening the company up to new asbestoslawsuits. Currently, only the trust, which was formed in 1988as part of the company's bankruptcy-court reorganization, canbe sued.   Maryanna Smith, executive director of the trust, said thetrust and Manville believe that many of the judges'suggestions are unlikely to be adopted and may be barredunder bankruptcy law. She said the trust's attorneys believethat the company's funding can't be changed.   A spokesman for the company said it believes no changesare warranted in the plan that set up the trust. &quot;The plan .. . was well thought out and resolved through the judicialprocess. There's no basis for changing it,&quot; he said.   Manville also issued a statement saying that if the ban onlawsuits against the company were lifted, the trust's assetswould be hurt. &quot;If the injunction weren't in place, it coulddramatically reduce the value of all assets provided to thetrust, including the value of trust stock,&quot; it said.   The judges' harsh criticism of the Manville trust came atthe end of a hearing on efforts to settle about 500 asbestoscases involving workers from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. TheManville trust is one of the major defendants in thesettlement effort, which is being overseen by KennethFeinberg. The two judges appointed Mr. Feinberg, of Kaye,Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler, as special master inJanuary to come up with a settlement of the state and federalcases.   Mr. Feinberg advised the judges on the settlementnegotiations, which he said are making good progress. He saidthe defendants, all former makers of asbestos, which causesrespiratory ailments, had been notified of the amounts heexpects each to pay. He said the defendants are expected torespond within the next few days as the settlement talks neara May 30 deadline set by the judges last January.   But Mr. Feinberg said one problem that has emerged is thelengthy delay in getting any payments from the Manvilletrust. The trust recently told plaintiffs' attorneys thatcases settled now won't receive their first payments untilthe year 2004. Because of that delay, plaintiffs' attorneysdon't want the trust included in the settlement.   After the hearing, held in state supreme court inManhattan with both judges presiding, Mr. Feinberg said, &quot;Iremain optimistic that even without the Manville trust'sparticipation we can work out a settlement of the BrooklynNavy Yard cases involving all the other defendants.&quot;   The judges, however, appear determined to include theManville lawsuits in the settlement. &quot;It isn't satisfactory,from both courts' points of view, to leave Manville out ofit,&quot; Judge Weinstein said. &quot;We want these cases settled.&quot;   The judges, in a memorandum issued after the hearing,listed several possible steps that it said could beconsidered against the Manville trust. It also ordered thetrust to turn over details about its assets, administrativeexpenses, legal fees, projected payments to plaintiffs and anexplanation of why it currently can't pay damages.   &quot;If the defendants (in the Manville cases) claiminsufficient funds, there may be a fiduciary relationshiprequiring an inquiry into what the parties and insurers havebeen doing to maximize payments to the injured,&quot; the judgessaid.   Ms. Smith said all of the material requested by the twojudges is included in the trust's regular reports to thefederal bankruptcy court that oversaw the Manville case.   The judges said they may have the power to appoint areceiver for enough of the trust's assets to cover Manville'sshare of the Brooklyn Navy Yard cases. They also asked thetrust to explain why interest shouldn't be collected onclaims that won't be paid for several years, hinting thatinterest could be required as part of a judgment.   Another possibility, the judges said, would be for thefederal bankruptcy court to lift its injunction barring newasbestos lawsuits against the company. Because ailmentsallegedly caused by asbestos take years to appear, new casesare still being filed. And the judges said the trust could goback to the federal bankruptcy court and ask that the companyprovide more of its profits as funding.   The trust has assets of about $2.5 billion, mainlyManville stock. But it says it can afford to pay only about$250 million in claims this year and has already paid morethan $26 million. The company is to contribute its first $75million annual payment in August 1991 and will startcontributing 20% of its profit in 1992.   Ms. Smith said that the shortfall in paying claims wasanticipated when the trust was formed. But she said theshortfall had come sooner than expected because the trust hassettled more cases and paid more money than projected.</TEXT></DOC>
