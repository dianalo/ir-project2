Pete Wilson to consider as theyshape the state's budget for the 1991-'92 fiscal year.;    Wilson andlegislative leaders have agreed that the budget crisis represents anopportunity to reform -- and they hope streamline -- the way counties and thestate handle and pay for health and welfare programs.;    A plan advanced bythe Senate Republicans on April 9 calls for shifting full responsibility forhealth and social programs to the counties as part of the budget solution,along with the authority to raise local sales taxes if necessary.;    TheAssembly and Senate Democrats proposed a similar shift of responsibilitiesthat would be coupled with new statewide revenues, such as an increase invehicle registration fees and a boost in taxes on alcoholic beverages.;   Naake said the supervisors were attracted to elements in both proposals, butpreferred to see statewide taxes applied to local programs to ensure thatthere would be enough money.;    He cited the vehicle license fee proposal oran increase in the sales tax as revenue sources that would grow over time tokeep up with health costs.;    &quot;Previous attempts at program transfers havenot provided such revenues and, therefore, have not worked,&quot; the associationdirectors said.;    In the meantime, state officials watched anxiously asemployees at the Franchise Tax Board continued to open about 300,000 taxreturns each day, hoping more money than expected would come in.;    Boardspokesman Jim Reber said crews would work all weekend to bank the incomingmoney, and predicted the bulk of the job would be finished Monday.;    Rebersaid the state had collected $19.4 billion in personal and corporate incometaxes so far this fiscal year, compared to $18.9 billion a year ago, a 2.8percent increase.;    But state officials said revenues normally increase morethan 7 or 8 percent a year.;    Final April revenue totals will be announcednext month.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  McClatchy News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910420  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  467  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 20, 199100111005,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
