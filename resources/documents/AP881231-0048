Brezhnev's son-in-lawhas been convicted of bribery, but his lawyer expressed satisfactionwith the 12-year sentence, saying the Soviet Union is on the waytoward being a society based on law.   The nearly four-month trial of Yuri Churbanov and eight of hiscronies focused on sensational allegations of wrongdoing stretchingall the way to the Kremlin's former first family.   The tribunal on Friday found Churbanov guilty of taking nearly$145,000 in bribes, but dismissed some charges, spared him thefiring squad and sentenced him to 12 years in a labor camp.   Churbanov, 52, declined to talk to reporters afterward, but hislawyer, Andrei Makarov, expressed satisfaction with the decision.   ``You can agree or disagree with the sentence, but in substancethe throwing out of most of the charges leveled by the prosecutorsis indisputable,'' the lawyer told reporters.   Makarov said the court's decision showed that the Soviet Union ison the way to a society based on law. In an apparent reference totrials under dictator Josef Stalin in which trumped-up charges wereused to get rid of real or perceived enemies, Makarov told reportersthis case proved that politics no longer has a place in the Sovietcourtroom.   ``The trial rejected attempts to create a political trial from acriminal case, and to replace evidence with hullaboo around the caseand attempts artificially to fire up public opinion,'' Makarov said.   Churbanov served as first deputy Soviet interior minister, whichput him in the ranks of the few officials in charge of the nation'spolice, for two years before Brezhnev died in 1982. He continued inthe job until 1984 and was arrested in January 1987.   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Brezhnev has been harshlycriticized for fostering corruption and economic and culturalstagnation during his 18-year rule. On Thursday, the Kremlin tookanother swipe at Brezhnev by ordering that a plaque be removed fromhis former home and that factories and schools be stripped of hisname.   Churbanov married Brezhnev's daughter, Galina, in 1971 and wasaccused of using his family ties to advance his career and extortbribes.   Churbanov originally faced the death penalty on charges heaccepted bribes of more than $1.1 million.   But the military tribunal threw out some of the charges andreduced the amount of bribes Churbanov was accused of taking toabout $145,000. The court also convicted Churbanov of siphoning morethan $16,000 in Interior Ministry funds to construction of a cellarin his summer home.   Prosecutors had recommended a 15-year sentence.   Churbanov had pleaded guilty to abusing his office but innocentto bribe-taking. In his one day of testimony, he said he kept abriefcase handed to him stuffed with $160,000 because he ``feltawkward'' about returning it.   Churbanov's eight co-defendants were police officials from theCentral Asian republic of Uzbekistan, the focus of many reports oframpant corruption.   Six of the co-defendants were sentenced to labor camp termsranging from eight to 10 years.</TEXT></DOC>
