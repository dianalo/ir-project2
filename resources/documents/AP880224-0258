Nineteen search warrants were executed in 12 states and trophiesand animal parts were seized at some locations. Five airplanes wereseized at Anchorage, Alaska, but no arrests were made there.   Clark R. Bavin, chief of law enforcement for the Fish andWildlife Service, said at a news conference, ``We may have 30 to 35people charged eventually.''   Arrest warrants were obtained for two people in Maryland, one inMontana, four in North Carolina, four in West Virginia and 11 inVirginia, a total of 22. Twelve people in fact were arrested inVirginia and an additional suspect was being sought, but officialsin Washington did not immediately know where.   Agents established a kind of hunters' brokerage in Purcellville,Va., about 50 miles from Washington, that arranged hunts forcustomers, bringing guides and hunters together.   Bavin said the company, Abrams Creek Outfitters, spent a yearestablishing its cover through advertisments, attendance ofemployees at conventions and visits to guides.   The investigation began with a focus on out-of-season andairborne hunting of caribou and brown bears in Alaska, but grew toinclude illegal killing of black bears, frequently in and nearShenandoah National Park in Virginia, and sale of bear parts.   Bavin displayed a mounted, stuffed bear he said was taken inAlaska by a two-plane party that landed the hunters at a makeshiftcamp to kill the bear as it was driven toward them by the otherairplane.   ``This is totally illegal,'' he said.   Appearing with federal officials at the news conference, GeraldSimmons, chief of law enforcement for the Virginia Game and InlandFisheries Commission, said, ``Virginia was delighted to take part''because it appeared that as many as 200 black bears were killedillegally last year out of a population of 2,000 to 2,500. In legalhunting, 557 bears were killed in the state.   Simmons and Bavin displayed about a dozen bear gall bladders,wrapped in plastic bags, that had been seized in one arrest earlierin the day. These organs are considered valuable medicine in theFar East and may bring $300 each.   In addition, hides brought up to $250 each.   The forest-dwelling black bear was found in 49 states 200 yearsago, but practically decimated by the early part of this century.Conservation programs have restored the bear to 30 states, andhunting is often permitted.   Federal law makes it a crime to transport across state lineswidlife taken in violation of state law. That statute saysviolations can bring a year in prison and a $10,000 fine unless asale across state lines is involved, in which case the term may befive years and the fine $20,000. Under a 1984 law, the fine may bemultiplied to $250,000.   A 1971 law makes it a federal crime to shoot or harass wildlifefrom aircraft, with penalties specified as a possible yearlongprison term and fine of $5,000. The 1984 statute makes it possibleto multiply the fine to $100,000.</TEXT></DOC>
