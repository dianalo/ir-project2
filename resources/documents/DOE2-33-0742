The fluid is sensed by directinglight into the fiber optic element and detecting changes in the light,such as exit angle changes for example, that result from the changedoptical property of the coating material. The fluid detector may be usedfor such purposes as sensing toxic or explosive gases in the atmosphere,measuring ground water contamination or monitoring fluid flows in industrialprocesses, among other uses. 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
