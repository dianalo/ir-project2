Webb's best-selling novel ``Fieldsof Fire,'' a Vietnam War lieutenant ponders the dignity of menengaged in battle, and remarks ``it was the fight, not the causethat mattered.''   For Webb, who resigned Monday after only 10 months as secretaryof the Navy, there was always a fight or controversy, from hiscriticism of the service academies' admission of women in 1979 tohis lashing out at Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, as he didon his final day on the job.   ``This building (the Pentagon) needs to be led,'' the42-year-old Webb told reporters as he announced his departure. ``Itneeds leadership. It needs some vision. I'm saying that if I had apiece of advice to give to Secretary Carlucci, it would be to spenda lot more time with the top leaders in this building.''   Furor has dogged Webb almost from the day he was sworn in asNavy secretary on April 9, 1987.   Five days after the ceremony, Webb reversed a decision of hispredecessor, John F. Lehman, and ruled that the Navy would nolonger make special accomodations for officers who wanted to playprofessional sports.   Ensign Napoleon McCallum's weekend career with the NationalFootball League's Los Angeles Raiders thus ended and 7-foot-1Midshipman David Robinson's eventual start in the NationalBasketball Association was delayed.   In the same month, Webb reversed a Lehman decision. to dismiss aboard of admirals and rejected its promotion recommendations.L:ehman charged the board had improperly tried to promote nuclearsubmariners at the expense of aviation and surface warfare.   Webb took over the post of overseeing about 584,000 Navypersonnel and approximately 199,000 Marines amid a sea of problems,including sex scandals that had rocked the Marine Corps, debateover the size of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and the role ofMarine Lt. Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair.   North was all too familiar to Webb. During their student days atthe U.S. Naval Academy, they fought for the brigade boxingchampionship. North won.   A native of St. Joseph, Mo., Webb served in the Pentagon as theassistant secretary for reserve affairs on May 3, 1984. He wasabout to quit that job when then Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger made an offer he couldn't resist _ the job as secretaryof the navy.   Webb had served previsously on the Republican staff of the theCommittee on Veterans Affairs of the House of Representatives.   A 1968 graduate of the Naval Academy, Webb served with the 5thMarine Regiment in Vietnam as rifle platoon leader and companycommander, earning the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Starmedals for valor and two Purple Hearts.   After the war, he left the Marine Corps and earned a law degreefrom the Georgetown University Law Center, where he won the Horancompetition for excellence in legal writing.   Webb once said, ``In my mind, I am a writer. In my heart, I am asoldier, and I always will be.''   Webb wrote three novels, including ``Fields of Fire,'' ``A Senseof Honor,'' and ``A Country Such As This,'' and a non-fiction bookon military strategy, ``Micronesia and U.S. Pacific Strategy: ABlueprint for the 1980s.''   But an article for Washingtonian Magazine, ``Women Can'tFight,'' was his most controversial piece of writing, haunting himduring his Senate confirmation hearings for the Navy's top job. Inthe article, Webb wrote that women are ruining the militaryacademies by poisoning their ability to train men for combat.   Webb reiterated his opposition to committing women to combatduring the hearings, but said he had accepted the change in theacademies.   In fact last June, Webb ordered the Navy to allow femaletechnicians aboard submarines for sea trials to test new equipment.In announcing the decision, Webb said the policy ``will reinforcethe Department of Navy's equal employment opportunity objectives offull integration of women into the civilian work force.''</TEXT></DOC>
