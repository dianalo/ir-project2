KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congressional conservatives, grappling withglasnost, are having trouble coming to terms with the changes,disclosures and confessions of the government of Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev.   There is little unity of opinion.   An example is the reaction to the recent admissions by SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze regarding Afghanistan and theconstruction of a long-controversial advanced radar system.   Shevardnadze admitted the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979was immoral, illegal and a mistake.   He said construction of a sophisticated, phased-array radarsystem at Krasnoyarsk in the central Soviet Union was what itscritics always said it was _ an outright and direct violation ofthe 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty.   Two of the Senate's most conservative members took a look at thetwo confessions and came away with sharply different impressions ofthe Soviet Union's new openness.   One said glasnost had brought new evidence of Soviet duplicity,new reason to distrust any arms control treaty with the Kremlin.The other saw a new cause for hope.   One offered applause; the other, jeers.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said the admission that theKrasnoyarsk radar was a treaty violation is all the evidence onecould want that the Soviet Union intends to violate treaties beforeit signs them, does violate them, lies about the violations andcan't be trusted, now or in the future.   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., however, reacted to the news ofthe Soviet change of position on the invasion of Afghanistan bysaying, ``Bravo.''   The policy shift could be the beginning of a turnaround topermit the Afghan people to choose their own government, free ofSoviet intervention, Humphrey said.   Concentrating on Shevardnadze's admission about the radar, Helmssaid he had pointed to it as the ``smoking gun of Soviet armscontrol cheating'' shortly after U.S. intelligence detected it insummer 1983.   Helms noted that Soviet officials spent years denying the radarinstallation was a treaty violation.   Helms concluded: ``Mr. Shevardnadze has finally admitted thefundamental duplicity of Soviet foreign policy. He has finallyadmitted that the Soviets conduct arms control negotiations on thebasis of falsehood, cheat on solemn arms control treaties and thentry to camouflage and conceal their duplicity.''   The admission confirms the suspicion that the Soviets signed theABM treaty, the SALT I and SALT II treaties, and the IntermediateNuclear Forces or INF treaty fully intending to violate all ofthem, Helms asserted.   Helms said he believed the Soviets made the admission onlybecause the evidence had become so massive that it constituted ``asignificant barrier to improving U.S.-Soviet relations.''   ``This admission totally undermines any basis of trust in futuretreaties with the Soviet Union,'' Helms asserted.   Focusing on Afghanistan, Humphrey sounded an opposite note.Glasnost appears to be paying dividends at last, he said.   Humphrey has been the Senate's most persistent and outspokencritic of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.   But now, he said, ``the time has come for some praise.''   Shevardnadze called the Soviet invasion _ which occurred duringthe rule of the late Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev _ ``the mostserious violation of our own legislation, of party and civic normsand ethical standards of the times.''   ``This sort of frank admission of sins long denied bodes wellfor the success of glasnost, for openness and honesty of Sovietofficials,'' Humphrey said. ``... I say bravo.''   The admission of error, he said, allows him to hope that theSoviets soon will end their support for the Marxist regime leftbehind in Kabul when the Soviet occupation army withdrew fromAfghanistan.   Humphrey concluded: ``I salute Mr. Gorbachev for the courage toproclaim glasnost, for the courage to persist where glasnost hasled to painful re-evaluations and even admissions of grave error.''</TEXT></DOC>
