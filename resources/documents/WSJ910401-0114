But Japan ran a close second.   Japan's ambassador, Ryohei Murata, was publicly chided atthe media celebration for Japanese foot-dragging incontributing to the war in the Persian Gulf. And one of theshow's two principal skits featured Japanese samurai buyingup a state fair in Texas.</LP><TEXT>   With the war over, the nation's economic difficulties areonce again coming to the fore in Washington. And as theGridiron dinner demonstrated, Japan is under fire.   In a report released Friday, the Bush administration citedJapan as top offender in erecting barriers to trade. Theannual report, which included 17 pages on Japan, noted thatsome trade barriers have softened in the past year, buthighlighted that nation's tariffs on petrochemicals, aluminumand paper products; its restrictions on farm imports; itsexclusionary government procurement policies; its barriers toU.S. service companies; and a host of other complaints.   &quot;With the nation's prosperity and economic performanceincreasingly dependent on exports,&quot; said U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills, &quot;it becomes even more importantto secure freer access to foreign markets for U.S. products.&quot;   In addition, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher leftWashington for Japan last week with a brigade of U.S.businessmen representing 20 companies that have made afive-year commitment to try to crack the Japanese market.&quot;This answers Japanese complaints that U.S. companies aren'tinterested in the long haul and in pushing their wares,&quot;Secretary Mosbacher told reporters before his departure.   And President Bush will meet with Japanese Prime MinisterToshiki Kaifu later this week in Newport Beach, Calif., wherehe's expected to discuss U.S. frustration over Japan'sprohibition on rice imports and other trade issues,administration officials say.   The bilateral trade deficit with Japan, the second-largesttrading partner of the U.S., has declined noticeably in thepast year to $41.1 billion from $49 billion the previousyear. But it remains the largest single piece of the U.S.trade deficit. And it is certainly the most controversial.   Japanese barriers to rice imports are near the top ofcurrent U.S. concerns. The Friday report estimates that ifthe Japanese rice market were liberalized, U.S. exports couldeventually grab as much as $656 million a year in business.   U.S. officials also complain that Japanese intransigenceover rice has helped gum up the vitally important globaltrade negotiations being held under the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade.   Indeed, last year the Japanese government even helpedtorpedo a U.S.-led effort to liberalize farm trade conductedunder the auspices of GATT. On Dec. 6, 1990, at a crucialmeeting on farm-trade reform in Brussels, Japan joined withthe European Community to block a compromise that would havecut back the role that subsidies play in international farmtrade. That followed years of discussions between the U.S.and Japan in which Japanese negotiators repeatedly indicatedthey would be willing to address their ban on rice imports inthe broader context of GATT talks.   More recently, Japanese officials threatened legal actionagainst U.S. rice producers who tried to display theirproduct at a trade fair in Japan. Agriculture SecretaryEdward Madigan wrote a letter on March 21 to his counterpart,Motoji Kondo, protesting the incident.   Many U.S. farmers, Mr. Madigan wrote, &quot;drive pickup trucksmade by Isuzu and Toyota which were shipped from Japan. Nowthey believe that you refuse to accept their rice in paymentfor your trucks.&quot;   &quot;There are over two million farmers in America,&quot; Mr.Madigan said in his letter. &quot;Should they band togetheragainst buying Japanese products? Or are we united in ourgoal of accomplishing liberalized trade?&quot;   Japan is also getting bashed over its contributions to thecampaign against Iraq -- even though it paid off most of thatcommitment last month. Because of the strengthening dollar,Japan's pledge has lost about $600 million of its originallyestimated dollar value of about $9 billion. But the Japanesegovernment says it won't make up the difference. The Germangovernment, on the other hand, has agreed to pay the U.S. forany loss suffered because of currency fluctuations.   The surge of anti-Japanese sentiment in Washington hascertainly not gone without notice in Tokyo. In an attempt tosmooth over current differences and to pave the way for theBush-Kaifu meeting this week, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-generalof Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, visited Washington lastweek bearing conciliatory messages for President Bush andseveral cabinet officials. In another recent visit, ForeignMinister Taro Nakayama is said to have indicated that Japanwill address the rice issue once local elections next Sundayare over, according to both U.S. and Japanese officials.   Prime Minister Kaifu is also now struggling to rejiggerhis budget to increase imports from the U.S. &quot;We have agreedto cut back on our defense budget, but not cut back onpurchases of Aegis and Awacs systems to be imported from theU.S.,&quot; says Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.Japanese officials say they also have advised their exportersto give U.S. firms the right of way in the rush for Kuwaitreconstruction contracts.   In the U.S., too, Japanese firms show a desire to placate:The U.S. subsidiary of Mitsubishi Electric Corp., followingthe example of other Japanese exporters, last week settled aprice-fixing complaint with a promise to refund nearly $8million to U.S. purchasers of its TV sets.   Japan also is leaning toward reaching another agreementwith the U.S. on semiconductors after the current one expiresin July. Some Japanese authorities object to a new accord,arguing that Japan already gives the U.S. nearly the 20% ofits market called for in the current pact -- if you countInternational Business Machines Corp.'s chip shipments to itsJapanese subsidiary. A more conciliatory faction, however,leans toward accepting the U.S. contention that the U.S stillholds only about 13% of the Japanese market.   Some disputes remain intractable. Japan isn't ready tocapitulate to U.S. demands for more participation in Japanesepublic-works projects. The Japanese claim that contractsawarded to several U.S. firms prove that their market isalready sufficiently open.</TEXT></DOC>
