Technology was the deciding factor. But what he doesn't understand is that the race is intended to be only partly an athletic event. There are many sailboat races that are exactly what he wants -- races where the boats have to be from the same mold. But the America's Cup race is a designers' race. There were no restrictions that prevented the Australians from using superior ideas. That is exactly what they did three years ago. The bouncing about in the ocean is only the measuring to determine who won the design race.    The idea of Lindbergh's flight over the Atlantic, the Gossamer Condor man-powered flight, the flight of Voyager around the world and even the trip to the Moon was not to make heroes, although they did do that. These were all engineering races. There are plenty of athletic contests for athletes. But how many competitions are there for engineers? Not many. And now Mr. Boyd wants to take away some of our sport.    Daniel L. Caster   Bainbridge Isle, Wash.</TEXT></DOC>
