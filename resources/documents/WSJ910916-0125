In the ongoing legal battle over whether companies ortheir insurers should pay for cleanup costs, Friday'sdecision represented a significant victory for the side ofthe insured. The appeals court rejected insurers' argumentsthat reimbursements to the government for cleanups aren'tcovered under comprehensive general liability policies. Andthe three-judge appeals panel criticized a related decision,known as &quot;Nepacco,&quot; that insurance lawyers had relied on inother cases to make that argument.</LP><TEXT>   The appeals court case stems from the much-publicizedcontamination and subsequent evacuation of Times Beach, Mo.Independent Petrochemical Corp., which filed the suit, hadarranged for a contractor to dispose of waste containing thechemical dioxin. The contractor disposed of the material byspraying it on roads in and around Times Beach. Eventually,the federal government spent more than $100 million to cleanup the pollution and purchase the property in Times Beach.Independent Petrochemical is a subsidiary of Charter Oil Co.,which in turn is a unit of Charter Co. of Cincinnati.   The government is seeking $96 million from IndependentPetrochemical, which has filed for Chapter 11 protection fromcreditors, and the company sued 28 insurers demanding thatthey cover the cleanup costs.   Dennis M. Flannery, attorney for Insurance Co. of NorthAmerica, a subsidiary of Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp., whoargued the case on behalf of the insurers, declined tocomment.   John H. Gross, lawyer for Independent Petrochemical, saidInsurance Co. of North America and Aetna Casualty andamp; SuretyCo. in Hartford, Conn., face the &quot;greatest exposure&quot; on thosecosts. A spokesman for the unit of Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co.couldn't be reached.   The Nepacco case, decided in 1988 by the Eighth CircuitCourt of Appeals in Missouri, also concerned the Times Beachincident. In that case, one of the first in which thegovernment sought reimbursement for a cleanup under Superfundlaws, the appeals court ruled that the producer of thedioxin, Northern Pharmaceutical andamp; Chemical Co. (Nepacco),wasn't entitled to insurance coverage.   &quot;Nepacco is the key case insurance companies have reliedupon to beat the claims on policyholders nationwide. Now thecourt of appeals in Washington {has} said in strong languagethat Nepacco is wrong,&quot; said Mr. Gross, a partner in the NewYork law firm of Anderson Kill Olick andamp; Oshinsky.   For companies facing Superfund cleanups and theirinsurers, the stakes in the battle over who is responsiblefor reimbursing the federal government for environmentalcleanup costs may total $500 billion.   &quot;Anxiety is high,&quot; said Thomas Brunner, a partner in theWashington law firm of Wiley, Rein andamp; Fielding who is counselto the Insurance Environmental Litigation Association, anindustry group. &quot;Clearly, insurers cannot afford and neveranticipated paying a significant fraction&quot; of Superfundcosts, said Mr. Brunner. He said he expects insurers toappeal the case.   ---   MILKEN LOSES BID to disqualify Cravath from representingthe FDIC.   Attorneys for convicted felon Michael Milken, formerlyhead of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk-bond department,had asked a federal court to remove Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moorefrom the case because of an alleged conflict of interest. TheNew York firm was hired on a contingency-fee basis torepresent thrift regulators in pursuing claims against Mr.Milken and other defendants blamed for huge losses in thesavings-and-loan industry.   In federal court in Los Angeles, U.S. Judge Stephen Wilsonruled that Cravath had no conflict in the case before him,which involves losses at the failed Columbia Savings andamp; LoanAssociation.   On behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Cravathhas filed two suits in federal court in Manhattan andCalifornia alleging that Mr. Milken was the mastermind behinda scheme that rigged junk-bond transactions and defraudedthrifts of billions of dollars.   Mr. Milken, who is serving a 10-year sentence, has deniedany wrongdoing in connection with the savings and loans. Lastyear he pleaded guilty to six felonies related to securitiestransactions.   Alan Dershowitz and other attorneys for Mr. Milken hadclaimed that Cravath was intricately involved with junk-bondtransactions that are at the heart of the regulators'allegations. But Cravath said it had no conflict with thedefendants in the case and had received no confidentialinformation about Drexel in its previous work forunderwriters or issuers of high-yield junk bonds.   Judge Wilson, however, left the door open for Mr.Dershowitz to present additional information about Cravath'sdealings with the junk-bond industry. Mr. Dershowitz said healso plans to ask the court to review &quot;the unethical pleabargains Cravath has made&quot; with former Drexel ChairmanFrederick Joseph and former Drexel junk-bond salesman JamesDahl. The two were dropped as defendants in the FDIClitigation after they agreed to cooperate with Cravath.   ---   NEW YORK CITY BAN on `unnecessary noise' isunconstitutional, judge rules.   U.S. Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan said the law's &quot;generalprohibition&quot; against unnecessary noise was so broad that itviolated First Amendment rights of free speech. The judgesaid that the city's narrower anti-noise laws, such asrestrictions on sound amplifiers and certain types of noise,are constitutional, however. The city more typically invokesthose restrictions when prosecuting noise cases.   The unnecessary-noise law was challenged by Dae Woo Kim,who was arrested several times for noise violations anddisorderly conduct while trying to preach through anamplifier on a public sidewalk. The law defines &quot;unnecessarynoise&quot; as &quot;any sound which either annoys, disturbs, injuresor endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety ofa person . . . or causes injury to plant or animal life.&quot;   In overturning the law, Judge Wood said, &quot;The ordinancewould apply to speech delivered in a moderate tone, or even awhisper, so long as it annoys another person.&quot; She added thatthe law's &quot;subjective definition of unnecessary noise offendsbasic free-speech principles because it would support aconviction where the content of the speech annoys aparticular listener.&quot;   The judge also ruled, however, that the city had actedproperly in arresting Mr. Kim under the narrower noise lawsand other regulations.   An attorney for the city was unavailable for comment.   ---   IBM SETTLES race discrimination suit with former salesmanin Detroit.   The settlement came Friday as the trial entered its fourthday. International Business Machines Corp.'s chairman, JohnF. Akers, had been scheduled to testify this week. Attorneysfor the plaintiff, Joseph Martin, said they had been planningto ask Mr. Akers questions about the computer company's &quot;opendoor&quot; policy, which permits every employee to appeal asupervisor's decision to the very top of management. Thepolicy was a major issue in the case.   The settlement must still go before a state court judge.Neither party would comment on the terms of the settlement,which are confidential. But Mr. Martin's lawyer, Noel Gage,of the Southfield, Mich., law firm Gage, Beach andamp; Ager, saidthe conditions of the settlement prevented the parties frommaking public a videotape of Mr. Akers's pre-trialdeposition.   ---   CALIFORNIA LAWYERS becoming more ethnically diverse, barsurvey shows.   The survey, mailed at random to 14,300 members of theState Bar of California, found that the country's largest barassociation is 91% white and 74% male. But white men don'tdominate the ranks of California lawyers who have been inpractice fewer than five years. The California barassociation has 128,300 members.   Among those newer -- and presumably younger -- attorneys,49% are white males, compared with 93% of lawyers who havebeen in practice for 20 years or more, the survey said.   Some 12% of the newer lawyers described themselves as&quot;non-white,&quot; compared with only 3% of those who have beenattorneys for 20 years or more. Moreover, among attorneys inpractice fewer than five years, 45% are women, compared withonly 4% who have practiced 20 years or more.   The survey, which compiled a broad range of demographicdata, also found that women lawyers are more likely to besingle, divorced and childless than their male counterparts.   &quot;Elimination of barriers which inhibit the fullparticipation in our profession of women and persons of colormust be one of our highest priorities,&quot; said State BarPresident-Elect John M. Seitman.   The survey also showed that the lawyers' annual incomesvary widely, with 17% of the attorneys in private practiceearning less than $50,000 a year and 15% of the lawyersmaking more than $200,000. Most lawyers in the lattercategory work at large law firms, the survey found.   ---   NOTED: Stephen D.
