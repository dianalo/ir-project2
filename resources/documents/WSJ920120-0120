But that strategy backfired as stories began tofocus on the huge salaries and bonuses these executivesreceive. This was particularly embarrassing in light ofcompany losses and -- particularly in the case of GeneralMotors -- record layoffs. Soon afterward, more stories aboutthe inverse relationship between executive pay and corporateperformance began to appear. Top officers at Coopers andamp;Lybrand and other service-oriented firms were chastised forbudgeting large pay increases for top executives despitesteep drops in earnings.   What these stories highlight is the lack of imaginativeand innovative leadership among the directors and executiveofficers of America's major industries. Particularlybothersome is the knee-jerk reaction on the part of privateindustry to reduce staff at the first sign of flagging sales,with little or no action taken to shake things up at the top.</LP><TEXT>   The practice of architecture is immediately sensitive toslowdowns in the economy. As our architectural firm saw itsworkload decrease, we recognized that we had to reduce staffto survive as a viable firm. However, after an initialreduction of a few staff members, we realized that if wecontinued reducing our staff, we would be losing our mostvaluable resource: those who have years of experience andtraining with our firm. These are the people upon whom wedepend to maintain the quality of our work, and our futuresuccess depends on them. We therefore decided on thefollowing course of action:   We called our entire staff together and told it that wewere all going to take pay cuts in order to maintain staffand ensure the survival of the firm. But the percentage ofpay cuts would increase in proportion to salary levels.   The staffers at the lower end of the pay scale were askedto accept a 10% cut in salary; the people in the mid-rangewere asked to take a 15% cut in salary; the people in theupper range of salary took a 20% cut; and the principals tooka 30% cut in salary. While none of us welcomed this step, thestaff recognized that the graduated scale of percentage cutswas equitable. Actually, our work has improved since then andwe have restored the pay cuts at the lower levels.   I would like to offer a modest proposal to restore thequality of leadership among our executives -- both privateand public -- and rebuild the confidence of workingconsumers. For those ailing U.S. industries that mightotherwise see major surgery on their work forces as the onlycure, I suggest the following steps:   1. All executives who have salaries plus bonuses of $1million or more take a 50% cut for the next two years.   2. All executives whose salaries and bonuses exceed$500,000 take a 30% cut.   3. Staff who earn in salary and bonuses over $100,000 takea 20% cut.   4. Staff between $50,000 and $100,000 take a 15% cut.   5. Staff between $30,000 and $50,000 take a 10% cut.   6. Staff below $30,000 take a 5% cut.   These steps would be accompanied by vigorous announcementsto the affected employees and to the general public,challenging federal and state executives to follow suit.   On the government level, President Bush and cabinetmembers should take a voluntary 20% cut and challenge membersof Congress to do the same. The president could propose thesame schedule of cuts I've suggested for the private sector,so that the people at the lower end of the scale wouldrecognize the fundamental fairness of the situation.   While there may be many excellent excuses as to why thisis not feasible, the excuse I hear most often is notcredible: that union agreements would make this impossible.No union leader given the choice between further layoffs andsalary cuts -- matched by graduated percentages of salarycuts in the upper echelons -- would fail to understand theurgency and equity of the situation. And if the leaders didresist, the rank-and-file members probably would overrulethem.   What would be the fallout from such a bold initiativetaken by private industry? It might rekindle a sense ofcompany loyalty, when the working stiffs realize that uppermanagement is also pitching in on a personal level to keepthe ship afloat. If both the large corporations and thehundreds of thousands of small businesses could adopt thisproposal, modified to suit individual companies, a sense ofconfidence could slowly return and help fuel the recovery.What is required is a reassertion of leadership, a qualitythat has been slowly disappearing as both government andprivate-industry managers have overbuilt and retreated intotheir own bureaucratic morass.   Should corporate leaders adopt this procedure, it would bedifficult for government leaders to resist following suit.Budget deficits would be reduced, threats of layoffs woulddiminish, and a sense of confidence might return to the bodypolitic.   This is my modest proposal. I think it makes sense. Isanybody out there listening?   ---   Mr. Ehrlich is CEO of an architectural firm based in LosAltos, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
