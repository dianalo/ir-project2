Aides wanted him to land a plane on an aircraft carrier off the Florida coast, but cooler heads prevailed.    Needing a strong showing in the Southern primaries, but unable to afford a big blitz of television commercials, the Ohio Democrat's strategists had turned to the old-fashioned way to get on TV for free: gimmickry.    Politicians call it &quot;free media,&quot; as opposed to advertising, or &quot;paid media.&quot; While it's important for any candidate in any race, in a presidential campaign, says Democratic media consultant Robert Squier, &quot;It's everything.&quot;    Campaign schedules and events are built around getting the candidate on the evening news. Major speeches are scheduled early in the day, all the easier for TV reporters to assemble their stories, and feature a visually interesting gimmick that will look good on the tube. After all, rallies may attract tens of thousands of people, but TV news shows reach millions.    In this election, free media may take on even more importance as 20 states from Massachusetts to Washington hold primaries or caucuses on a single day, March 8. &quot;There's no way on God's green earth that any candidate is going to have enough money to have a major impact {that day} through paid media,&quot; says Jody Powell, head of a Washington public relations office and former press secretary for President Carter.    Ideally, a campaign's free media and paid media mesh seamlessly, one reinforcing the other. President Reagan's 1984 re-election effort may have set a new standard in this regard. Rallies were meticulously staged to reinforce the campaign's message of patriotism and optimism. The result was news footage that looked like the campaign's commercials.    Some media executives say that sort of thing won't happen again. &quot;We learned enormous lessons from 1984,&quot; says Richard Cohen, CBS News' senior producer for political coverage. &quot;We were badly used by the White House.&quot; In planning for 1988, Mr. Cohen says, he and his colleagues have &quot;talked a lot about distinguishing between candidates who seek to separate themselves out with images instead of words.&quot;    Still, many wonder whether television will really be able to resist putting arresting pictures on the air, whether there's any substance to go with them or not. Politicians don't seem to think that things will change much. &quot;We thought television would force the candidates to talk about substance,&quot; says John Reilly, who was senior counselor to the Mondale campaign. &quot;They didn't.&quot;    Certainly, substance and relevance have never been prerequisites for getting on the tube. Sen. John Kennedy dropped in on Jack Paar's &quot;Tonight&quot; show in June 1960, just weeks before the Democratic convention. Richard Nixon, trying to soften his image before the 1968 campaign, popped up on &quot;Rowan andamp; Martin's Laugh-In&quot; to utter a &quot;Sock it to me.&quot; In that same campaign, Vice President Hubert Humphrey chatted with puppets on a local children's show in the Midwest, hoping to reach blue-collar housewives. And Sen. Edmund Muskie mesmerized a lobster for Dinah Shore on her afternoon talk show in 1971.    Some outlandish stunts aren't novel, either. In 1972, New York Mayor John Lindsay made a media event out of sleeping on a Wisconsin steelworker's couch. Jesse Jackson did much the same thing a dozen years later.    Not all media attention is created equal, though. It can hurt if it conflicts with the campaign's themes and messages, or if it makes a candidate appear frivolous and desperate for the attention. Sen. Glenn's advertisements in 1984, for instance, stressed leadership for the future. But in television news reports, voters saw a man whose campaign was in disarray. He didn't win any Southern primaries and dropped out.    The crowded field for 1988 will also work against many candidates. Because broadcasters have only a few minutes of airtime a night for political coverage, their tendency will be to focus on those candidates who have already won or placed in primaries, and those with special niches -- such as Jesse Jackson or Pat Robertson. Thus, candidates who don't do well at the outset, or those who dodge or de-emphasize the early political tests, may find it hard to attract the airtime they will eventually need.    Getting on television often poses a Catch-22 for dark-horse candidates: most television producers don't want them unless they're well known, but they can't be better known if they can't get on the air. &quot;The front-runners get free media,&quot; says Michael McCurry, press secretary for Democratic candidate Bruce Babbitt. &quot;Ours is earned media.&quot;    Back in 1975, recalls Mr. Powell, the only way he could have gotten Jimmy Carter on television would have been to have the former Georgia governor &quot;set his hair on fire in public -- with ample advance notice.&quot; Mr. Powell did manage to get Mr. Carter on a morning talk show in Des Moines that year; while the candidate didn't have to incinerate himself, he did have to cook a catfish.    This year, Mr. Babbitt, another little-known former governor, became expert at generating media attention. He bicycled across Iowa, scaled New Hampshire's Mount Washington, hiked through the Grand Canyon and rafted down the Colorado River. Earlier this fall, he appeared in a skit on NBC's &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot;    Recent changes in both presidential campaigning and television benefit lesser-known presidential candidates hoping to bask for a moment in the warm glow of the tube. One development is the growing number -- and length -- of news and talk shows. In many major cities, there are as many as three local or syndicated talk shows each morning and as much as two hours of local news each night, presenting candidates with all sorts of opportunities to be seen and heard.    Television news executives say they try to be selective in how they fill that time, rejecting events that appear to be designed solely to attract cameras. &quot;Some are obviously so bad they don't even get consideration,&quot; says Paul Rhoades, news director and anchorman at KCCI-TV, the station with the top-rated newscast in Des Moines.    Still, advanced satellite and microwave technology that lets stations broadcast live from virtually anywhere creates new opportunities for candidates. By carefully timing his arrival, for example, a candidate can virtually step off an airplane and into thousands of living rooms on the local evening news. Gary Hart did that with a series of airport appearances in the days leading up to the Southern primaries in 1984.    One other episode from that campaign points up both how attractive TV is for candidates, and how hard it is for television executives to resist the lure of arresting images. It was at a woodmen's competition in Berlin, N.H., as Mr. Hart was rising from dark horse to serious challenger. Wearing blue jeans, a checkered shirt and red suspenders, the candidate threw a huge, long-handled ax at a target on a tree stump. Amazingly, the ax hit the target dead center. A beaming Mr. Hart spread his arms wide and took a showy bow, as if he knew all along that he would do it.    The metaphor for his suddenly energized campaign was nearly perfect. But what most viewers didn't see -- and didn't know -- was that it was actually Mr. Hart's second throw. The first one missed.    ---   Mr. Yang reports on politics from The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
