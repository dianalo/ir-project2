Almost $3.5 billion poured into stock funds in November,bringing the total inflow for last year's first 11 months to$31 billion. That's well ahead of the previous record year,1986, when stock funds attracted $21.9 billion for the fullyear.</LP><TEXT>   Fund companies say the pace of stockfund sales picked upsharply in December.   &quot;It has been a very strong month,&quot; reports Michael Hines,a senior vice president with Fidelity Investments, the largeBoston fund group. In buying stock funds, &quot;investors arelooking over the horizon to better economic times,&quot; he says.   Last month, Fidelity enjoyed its strongest stock-fundsales in four years. At T. Rowe Price Associates inBaltimore, December's inflows into stock funds were 2 1/2times November's. At Vanguard Group, the country's thirdlargest mutual fund company, telephone calls from investorshave recently been running as much as 60% above normallevels.   Monday &quot;was the busiest day I've ever seen,&quot; says DavidRuf, a Vanguard telephone service representative. &quot;We've hada lot of people calling up. There's a marked increase in theinterest in stocks.&quot;   Other fund groups, including Dreyfus Corp., MassachusettsFinancial Services, Putnam Cos., Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark andShearson Lehman Brothers, also report a spike upwards instock-fund inflows during December.   A lot of the new money is ending up in small-company stockfunds, which have been dazzling performers with average 1991gains of 43.9%. A flood of cash has already prompted JanusVenture Fund to stop accepting money from new investors, andNicholas Limited Edition has said it won't even takeadditional money from current shareholders. Montgomery SmallCap Fund has announced that it will close to new investorswithin the next few months, and Babson Enterprise Fund willshut its doors on Jan. 31.   Last month's rush into stock funds startled fund-groupexecutives. &quot;I'm surprised about the strength of ourstock-fund sales, given all the publicity about year-endcapital gains distributions,&quot; says Bruce Speca, a senior vicepresident with TNE Fund Group, a unit of New England MutualLife Insurance Co.   Investors are often advised to avoid buying stock fundslate in the year, because this can have the effect ofunnecessarily boosting their tax bill.   Here's the predicament: Each year, a mutual fund isobliged by law to distribute to shareholders nearly all thecapital gains and all the income that the fund earned. Manystock funds make only one set of distributions each year, atthe end of December.   Investors have to pay taxes on these distributions, evenif they are new to the fund and even if they choose toreinvest the money in additional fund shares. The amountsinvolved can be pretty hefty, especially in a year like 1991,when stock funds gained an average 31.2%.   A year ago, investors apparently took heed of the warningsabout year-end distributions. Just $184 million flowed intostock funds in December 1990, well below 1990's averagemonthly sales pace of almost $1.1 billion.   The past year's deluge of money into stock funds may notlast, according to a study conducted for Fidelity by theUniversity of Michigan Survey Research Center. The surveyfound that only 13% of mutual fund shareholders plan to addto their stock-fund holdings in the next three months, downfrom 39% in November. (These figures reflect the percentageplanning to buy stock funds, minus those planning to sell.)   Bond-fund sales also show signs of waning. According tofigures released Tuesday by the Investment Company Institute,$6.7 billion poured into bond funds in November, down from$9.6 billion in October. For the first 11 months of 1991,bond funds attracted $63.4 billion, the biggest inflow infive years.   (These figures include bond-fund sales less redemptions,plus the net result of switches between bond funds and otherfunds in the same fund group. Reinvested dividends areexcluded.)   Robert Leo, Shearson's director of mutual funds, saysbond-fund sales have been soaring because of the sharpdifference between the paltry yields on money-market fundsand bank certificates of deposit, and the more generouspayouts still offered by many bond funds.   &quot;What's driving the business is interest rate shock,&quot; saysMr. Leo. &quot;The discount rate reduction on Dec. 20 justemphasized what people are up against. We saw our bond-fundsales kick up in the next couple of days after that.&quot;   At Scudder, money has been fleeing the fund group'staxable money-market fund, now yielding just 4.89%. Thecompany's bond funds, meanwhile, have been ballooning insize. The two best sellers are Scudder's short-term bond fundand its short-term global income fund, both yielding wellover 7%.   &quot;People are getting their money's worth with the switch&quot;from money funds to bond funds, contends Gavin Quill, amarketing research analyst with Scudder.</TEXT></DOC>
