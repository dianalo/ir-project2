From one end of thestate's capitol building to the other, politicalprofessionals who thought they had life tenure are packing upand getting out. Depending on where you sit, this is either atragedy or cause to celebrate.   Assembly Majority Floor Leader Tom Hannigan is retiring.Mike Roos, the Assembly Speaker Pro Tem, is consideringresigning to head a group seeking to improve the publicschools. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown says that as many as40% of Assembly members may retire by next year -- either torun for other offices or take new jobs.</LP><TEXT>   Democratic Assemblyman Richard Floyd says he'll virtuallyclose his district office and tell constituents who voted forterm limits to look for help elsewhere. &quot;I'm depressed,&quot; hesays. &quot;There's no future for me. There's no future for mystaff.&quot; He has asked his four district aides to take the fivemonths' severance pay offered staffers if they leave beforecuts in the legislature's budget hit in July. They will bereplaced by a part-time worker and an answering service.   Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, a 24-year incumbent wellknown for his advocacy of a &quot;commission on self-esteem&quot; inthe 1970s, is even more bitter. He says he may resign beforehis current term expires. &quot;I'm reducing my working time to 40hours a week,&quot; he told the Los Angeles Times. &quot;I don't seeany point in killing myself for people who apparently don'tcare if they have decent government or not.&quot; Mr. Vasconcellossays he can't believe the voters were so &quot;self-destructive.&quot;   All this is as it should be, according to Lew Uhler, aco-author of the term-limit initiative. &quot;In private life ifsomeone spends eight years in the same job, you wonder why hehasn't either been promoted or fired,&quot; he says. &quot;Term limitsmean the best legislators will try for promotion to Congress,statewide office or the nonprofit sector. Anyone can stillspend a lifetime in politics, but you must keep climbing thecareer ladder. The best ones will.&quot;   Democrat Tom McEnery, a former San Jose mayor and friendof the embittered Mr. Vasconcellos, agrees. He says hisfriend &quot;can make other contributions.&quot; He compares thelegislature to a &quot;hermetically sealed mayonnaise jar.&quot; Mostmembers, he says, don't realize they are part of &quot;a fatallyflawed system.&quot;   Leaving the safety of their sealed jar has been awrenching experience for departing staffers. &quot;The Capitol isa subculture, a separate community,&quot; says Kevin Sloat, chiefof staff to State Senator Marian Bergeson. &quot;Being forced toleave is a major upheaval. It's almost like forcing a midlifecrisis on someone.&quot; More than 700 of the legislature's 2,500staffers are taking the five months' severance pay andretiring.   The staffers complain that their absence will mean thelegislature will depend more on lobbyists for advice andinformation. But far from being pleased, the lobbyistsinstead fear losing their &quot;investments&quot; -- longtimeincumbents who became attuned to their interests. JackCarrigan, executive director of the California Commission onAging, says many elderly lobbies fear having to &quot;educate&quot; awhole new crop of legislators. &quot;There's real potential theaging programs in California will be weakened this way,&quot; hesays.   None of this is to suggest that the survivors who arestaying with the ship are ready to surrender to the voterseverything they've worked for. Both houses have voted to filea lawsuit claiming the term limits are unconstitutionalbecause they &quot;reduce the legislature to an agency, ratherthan a co-equal branch of government.&quot; Legal scholars viewthat argument skeptically, because term limits already applyto the President and 28 governors.   Speaker Brown, who calls term limits the equivalent of&quot;terrorist bombs,&quot; also claims that they're racist becausethe most powerful minority politicians, including him, arelongtime incumbents. But in fact legislative turnover wouldopen up demographically changing districts to women andminorities, which is indeed why some Hispanic groups and theNational Organization for Women endorsed a milder state termlimit. Who would deny that the quality of our politicssuffers now because bright people, often representingminority interests, are thwarted by old-boy incumbencynetworks?   If the California experience is repeated elsewhere, votersmay yet achieve what had begun to seem impossible: a real andlasting improvement in the political life of the UnitedStates.</TEXT></DOC>
