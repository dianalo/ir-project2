(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There weren't many people at Heritage USAon Monday after a grand jury indicted PTL founder Jim Bakker, butthose who were there said the Christian spirit is down but not outat the theme park.   John and Frances Lambert of Renfrew, Ontario, have been stayingin the PTL trailer park for about three weeks.   Lambert said he didn't know much about the charges againstBakker, or the alleged conspiracy involving the contributions of``lifetime partners,'' or major contributors.   ``None of one of the ones I talked to were upset about it becausethey said `Well, we give to God's work,' and they didn't expect toget it back,'' Lambert said.   ``Jim and Tammy spent too much money, I guess,'' he said. ``Mywhole thing is, I hope they keep it (Heritage USA) going as aChristian place.''   The indictment alleges that Bakker and his top aide committedfraud by misleading partners on the benefits they would get fromtheir contributions.   Mrs. Lambert said there were fewer people on the grounds thanwhen they visited last year, but she didn't mind that.   ``Because of it being slower, you get more of a chance to get outand see things.''   ``We're really enjoying our stay, and the friendliness of thewhole area,'' said Lambert.   Bakker resigned from the ministry in March 1987 after he admitteda sexual tryst with a former church secretary.   After the ministry filed for reorganization under federalbankruptcy law in June 1987, a trustee was appointed by the court tooversee Heritage USA. Officials have said that visitors to the themepark have declined since the scandal broke, and have laid off manypark employees as they struggle to keep PTL's finances afloat.   Outside the Heritage Grand Hotel on Monday, only the splash of alighted fountain broke the stillness. Around the lobby of the hotel,which has about one-third of its 490 rooms occupied, were lamp postsspiraled with red ribbon like candy canes.   Todd Loren, a bellman at the hotel, said he was a devotedfollower of Bakker at one time.   ``I don't think that (the indictments) has an effect onanybody,'' Loren said. ``It just means he gets his day in court.That's the least he deserves.''   As for the relative quiet of the scene Monday, he said: ``It'sbeen quiet for 18 months now.''   Linda Masters of Charlotte, N.C., said she'd been visitingHeritage for about four years and was saddened by its downfall.   ``The crowd isn't here at all,'' Ms. Masters said. ``This placewas filled with the Holy Spirit, with God. The Holy Spirit is stillhere, but it's terribly regretful what all has happened.   ``I loved Jim and Tammy Bakker. My heart really aches for them,''Ms. Masters said. ``They were given a vision here from God.''   She said she still trusts the Bakkers despite the allegationsagainst them.   ``I think he's forgiven. All men sin, and he's just a man.''</TEXT></DOC>
