Col. Oliver North was seeking a structure for U.S. weapon sales to Iran that would provide funds for White House-backed guerrillas in Nicaragua.    Speaking to an Israeli official in early December, Col. North alluded to Nicaragua and to the need to generate profits from the Iran arms sales, according to sources familiar with evidence provided to House and Senate investigators. The Israeli account places the conversation more than a month before President Reagan authorized direct U.S. arms sales to Iran, and it contradicts Col. North's testimony that the diversion scheme arose from a proposal by Iranian middleman Manucher Ghorbanifar in late January 1986.    Under an agreement with the Israeli government, congressional investigators have kept details of the Israeli account closely guarded. But a chronology provided to investigators cites the exchange, and two persons familiar with the Israeli evidence say a contemporaneous note of the reported conversation with Col. North also exists.    The date of the conversation coincides closely with a trip by the Marine officer to London the first week of December 1985. Before leaving the U.S., the sources said, Col. North traveled first to New York, where he spoke with an Israeli official.    A major question then was how to replenish Israeli weapon stocks after Israel's arms sales to Iran, and Col. North had been negotiating with an Israeli purchasing office in New York on this issue. Ultimately, a portion of the profits generated by the U.S. sales in 1986 was used for this purpose. The new evidence indicates that Col. North also was pursuing plans to use funds from the sales for his purposes.    The Israeli account is significant because it fits a pattern in other evidence that shows the Marine officer moving aggressively in late 1985 to influence and ultimately take control of the Iran initiative. It not only poses contradictions to Col. North's testimony but raises questions about whether former National Security Adviser John Poindexter knew more than he has admitted, or was in fact misled by Col. North.    The reported discussion of the diversion scheme in December 1985 parallels the early involvement of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a key player in the Contra arms network. Beginning with an unsuccessful sale of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Tehran in November 1985, Col. North was quick to involve his ally.    In a Dec. 4 memo to Rear Adm. Poindexter prior to his London trip, the former NSC aide outlined an ambitious plan of arms sales to Iran in tandem with Israel and added, without explanation, &quot;All $ are now under our control.&quot; After returning from London -- and after his reported conversation with the Israeli official in New York -- Col. North prepared another memo, dated Dec. 9, in which he suggested for the first time using Gen. Secord as the conduit for direct U.S. arms sales to Tehran.    The currency in the weapon sales to Iran then was said by negotiators to be American hostages, not dollars. But a Pentagon chronology of this period describes the NSC &quot;shopping,&quot; with &quot;$25 million available&quot; -- a figure believed to match the amount of Iranian funds temporarily left in an escrow account when the Hawk sale fell through.    Adm. Poindexter has testified that, in January 1986 -- the period when it was decided to use Gen. Secord in the Iran initiative -- Col. North was recounting to him the retired general's losses in his activities on behalf of the Contras.    Documents released Friday by congressional investigators underscore Col. North's deep involvement in this period with the insurgents, as well as his efforts to nurture a conservative network raising private funds for Gen. Secord's operations for the Contras.    December 1985 was a particularly anxious time for the administration regarding the Contras, and Adm. Poindexter -- as newly appointed security adviser -- traveled to Central America that month. Col. North had begun to tap funds raised by conservative Carl &quot;Spitz&quot; Channell to pay for an airlift into Nicaragua mounted by Gen. Secord. And former presidential aide David Fischer was hired the next month to facilitate arrangements for a White House function, where major Channell contributors met with Mr. Reagan briefly.    &quot;Hire Fisher (sic) to bring us all over to W.H. to meet w/RR,&quot; reads one of the memos written inside the Channell organization, and Col. North's own calendar and personal notes are laced with references to meetings and phone conversations with persons working with Mr. Channell. The Marine officer, who collected yet another of his many code names -- this one &quot;Green&quot; -- from the Channel operatives, gave the organization direction, through Washington publicist Richard Miller, for the establishment of offshore accounts and the disposition of funds.    &quot;Spitz to call Wickham,&quot; reads one document, a June 1986 notation by Col. North that suggests a possible link between the fund-raising apparatus and Ben Wickham, a young former Central Intelligence Agency officer. Mr. Wickham, a top aide to the late CIA director William Casey, left the CIA with Mr. Casey's encouragement in late 1985 to work overseas on behalf of the Contras, according to intelligence sources.    The documents also better establish Col. North's own direct dealings with a British special operations veteran, David Walker. The Marine's office schedule indicates he met with Mr. Walker and Contra leader Adolfo Calero on at least two occasions in 1985, including one meeting days after private mercenaries linked to Mr. Walker's security firm had participated in a raid deep inside Nicaragua. </TEXT></DOC>
