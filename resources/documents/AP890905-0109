Menem, brother of President Carlos Menem, also told a newsconference he believes negotiations in Madrid next month will leadBritain and Argentina to restore diplomatic relations.   Diplomatic ties were severed during the 1982 Falkland Islandswar, when Britain drove Argentine invaders from the South Atlanticarchipelago.   ``Demilitarization means only one thing,'' Menem said. ``Ofcourse, it is a reduction of forces in the area. I think there is aconsensus for making the South Atlantic an area of peace.'   Menem was in London for a meeting of the Inter-ParliamentaryUnion, a 108-nation conference of legislators. He shook hands andchatted with Queen Elizabeth II on Monday when she opened themeeting.   Since taking office two months ago, his brother has initiatedpeace overtures toward Britain, including ending an economic embargothis week.   Britain maintains a military garrison in the islands, as well asfighter aircraft and Rapier missiles, to guard the 1,600 Britishinhabitants.   The Defense Ministry refused Tuesday to give the current strengthof the garrison. British newspapers say it is down to about 1,000troops, about one-fourth the earlier size, because Britain isconfident Argentina will not attack again.   The Madrid talks are expected to focus on fishing rights andrestoring air links between Argentina and the islands.   Many observers believe Argentina wants to patch up thedifferences because Britain is a key member of the European EconomicCommunity. The 12-nation community is due to drop remaining tradebarriers and become a single market in 1992.   Senator Menen said Argentina ``never put economic considerationsin the forefront in our consideration of this subject.'' He added,``But if through this we manage to establish good commercialrelations, then be it welcome.''</TEXT></DOC>
