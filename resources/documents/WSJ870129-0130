Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Holdings Inc. expects to report a fourth-quarter loss that after nonrecurring charges will be wider than the third-quarter deficit of $5.4 million.    Aside from the charges, the securities firm turned in &quot;disappointing&quot; results in arbitrage, equity trading and investment banking, Francois Mayer and Robert Schoenthal, co-chief executives, said in an interview. Without the charges, the firm still would have had a loss for the quarter, Mr. Mayer said.    The charges, most of which were previously reported, include $3 million in severance fees paid to two principals of the firm, Thomas I. Unterberg and A. Robert Towbin, who left last month after losing a management struggle over the firm's direction. The other charges include $7.2 million in connection with the firm's move to new quarters here, a minor increase in the firm's reserve for possible litigation losses, and higher costs associated with the firm's diversification into mortgage banking and trading and mutual fund sales.    For 1986, the firm expects to report &quot;a very small profit,&quot; slightly exceeding &quot;break even,&quot; Mr. Mayer said. The firm earned $30.4 million in 1985 on revenue of $317.3 million. The concern went public in March 1986.    For the nine months, Rothschild earned $15.9 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $15.2 million, or $1.08 a share, on fewer shares outstanding. Revenue rose to $308.6 million from $221.7 million.    In connection with the departure of Messrs. Unterberg and Towbin, who resisted the speed of diversification moves backed by Messrs. Mayer and Schoenthal, the firm intends to change its name to L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc. at its annual shareholders meeting in May. Messrs. Unterberg and Towbin have since taken jobs at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Co.    Mr. Schoenthal said the firm had a loss on arbitrage activities in the fourth quarter, mainly because the insider-trading scandal involving arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky decimated the stock price of many takeover stocks in which arbitragers had significant positions. Mr. Schoenthal said the generally high volatility in equity prices led to some trading setbacks that pushed income in that area below last year's fourth-quarter level.    Asked why investment banking results were meager in the quarter while some other firms reported as much as 50% revenue gains in that area, Mr. Schoenthal said: &quot;That's a question I had also.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
