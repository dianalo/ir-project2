When gas producedby coal gasification processes is used as a fuel in gas turbines, theparticulate matter it contains can result in corrosion, erosion and depositionin the turbine and hot gas path. A review of the literature on hot gascleanup, published since 1983, was conducted. as well, cleanup systemsused on commercial or near commercial gasifiers were examined. Resultsindicate currently available systems operate at low temperature and useexpensive heat recovery trains to maintain system efficiency. It is concludedthat the benefits of cleanup at high temperature would be considerableand that research work in this area should be instigated. 133 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
