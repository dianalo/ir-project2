Algerian mediators shuttled between the booby-trapped jet andKuwaiti officials on Friday, the 11th day of the crisis.   The masked gunmen who commandeered the jumbo jet on a flightfrom Bangkok to Kuwait on April 5 want Kuwait to release 17terrorists convicted of bombing the U.S. and French embassies inKuwait in 1982.   ``In the name of God the merciful, I greet my family and myfriends and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisonersheld in Kuwaiti prisons,'' said Soleiman Mohammed Soleimanal-Mashari, one hostage, in a message to the control tower. ``Inthe event of refusal, they are going to kill us.''   In a second message, a man identifying himself as Mohammed AhmedAl-Ajem said: ``I am one of the hostages from the Boeing. I greetmy family, large and small and I ask the Kuwaiti authorities tofree the prisoners in the prisons. Without that, the kidnappershave decided to kill us.''   An estimated 31 passengers and four crew members were being heldin grim conditions by eight hijackers, armed with guns and grenades.   In Washington, a Reagan administration official speaking oncondition of anonymity said a man wanted in the United States inthe 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner was believed to be one of thegunmen on the Kuwaiti plane.   The official said the man, Hasan Izz-Al-Din, was named in a 1987federal indictment charging him and three others with conspiracy tocommit air piracy, murder and assault in the hijacking in which 39Americans were held hostage and a U.S. sailor was killed.   The Boeing 747, which had 112 passengers aboard when it beganits journey, was diverted to Mashhad in northeastern Iran, then toLarnaca, Cyprus. Fifty-seven passengers were released in Iran andanother 13 in Cyprus. Two passengers were killed in Cyprus.   The air pirates have threatened to kill the remaining hostagesand blow up the plane if their demands are not met.   Algerian officials expressed disappointment Friday thatnegotiations at the airport had not achieved better results.Negotiations began Wednesday, shortly after the plane arrived fromLarnaca, Cyprus.   Western sources in Paris said it was believed that parallel,high-level negotiations were also taking place between Kuwait andIran with Algeria acting as an intermediary.   A report by the official Kuwait news agency Friday said thehijackers appeared to be divided over the negotiations, and itseemed that Iran was directing the hard-line faction.   Some of the hijackers believed to have boarded in Mashhad had inrecent hours become ``more extremist and obstinate,'' said theagency KUNA, without citing any sources.   State-owned Kuwait radio reported that Kuwaiti Prime MinisterSheik Sad Al-Abdallah Al-Salim Al-Sabah on Friday telephonedAlgerian Premier Abdelhamid Brahimi to discuss ``theintensification of efforts being exerted to bring about the releaseof the passengers.''   The radio report, monitored in London, gave no details.   On Thursday, the hijackers released Djuma Abdallah Chatti, 70, adiabetic who was in urgent need of an insulin injection.   Before his release, he had been examined on board the plane byan Algerian doctor who told the hijackers Chatti was in danger ofdying if he did not receive treatment.   After Chatti was freed, the gunmen issued a statement saying,``We are not highway bandits.''   However, the hijackers repeated their demand and said they wouldcarry out executions ``even if the price we have to pay is veryhigh.''   A Kuwaiti official, who insisted on anonymity, said Chattireported that all of the hostages had their wrists handcuffedbehind their backs. They were not allowed to speak or move fromtheir seats in the mid-section of the plane except to be escortedto the toilets by one of the gunmen, who kept a pistol pointed atthe hostage's back.   Chatti said the hostages were completely ignorant of thenegotiations.   He said there were eight hijackers and that passengers weregrouped in seat rows 22 to 36, located directly above the fueltanks.   A Kuwaiti official who demanded anonymity said Chatti told theKuwaiti delegation that four bombs were attached to the four doorsin the midsection of the plane.   Among the hostages are three members of Kuwait's royal familyand at least four crew members.   Algerian officials on Thursday privately expressed optimism thattheir separate negotiations with the Shiite Moslem hijackers and aKuwaiti delegation would lead to the release of the last two womenon board, cousins of the emir of Kuwait.   There was widespread disappointment when only Chatti was freed.   Chatti said the hostage treated most roughly was the FadelKhaled Al-Sabah, 33, cousin of the emir of Kuwait, regarded as thehijackers' trump card.   Al-Sabah suffered from a severe nervous disorder even before heboarded the plane in Bangkok, and the experience of the hijack``seems to have put him over the brink,'' Chatti said.   Chatti said Al-Sabah had continuous violent shakes, was unableto speak and cries continuously. The hijackers brought a microphoneto him and tried to force him to make a statement, but he wasunable to do so.</TEXT></DOC>
