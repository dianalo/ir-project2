Bush's two-day visit to Beijing, starting Saturday, was to stressthe positive aspects of Sino-American relations that have developedsince the two nations established diplomatic ties 10 years ago.   Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing for more thana year in 1974-75, was to be given an effusive welcome as an oldfriend of China.   But the first bilateral summit since President Reagan visited in1984 also offers both sides a chance to vent some touchy issues, anddiscuss the quickly improving ties between China and its longtimeadversary, the Soviet Union.   ``They'll be lightly skipping over a number of issues rather thanboring in on one issue,'' said one U.S. official, who spoke oncondition he not be named.   Among the issues:   _ Taiwan. Chinese leaders insist that Taiwan remains the mostserious problem in Sino-U.S. relations. Beijing says Washingtonshould play a more active role in bringing about a peacefulreunification of Taiwan with the mainland, and condemns continuedU.S. arms sales to the Nationalist government on Taiwan, estimatedat $700 million in 1987.   ``Some prominent Americans still cling to the hope of long-termcontrol of Taiwan as an `unsinkable aircraft carrier,''' GuoXiangzhi of the Taiwan Research Institute in the Academy of SocialSciences wrote in a recent article.   The United States has welcomed the lessening of tensions acrossthe Taiwan Straits in the past several years, particularly Taiwan'sdecision to ease travel and trade restrictions with the mainland.But it says the Taiwan question is one for the Chinese to solvethemselves.   Taiwanese groups in the United States have urged Bush to backself-determination for Taiwan when he meets Deng Xiaoping and otherChinese leaders. The Taiwan government has expressed concern thatChina will push Bush into a mediator role.   _ Tibet. The United States supports Chinese claims to sovereigntyover Tibet, but has concerns over alleged human rights violations inChina's suppression of pro-independence disturbances in Tibet overthe past 18 months.   China rejects criticisms of its human rights record, and saysU.S. congressional resolutions on Tibet are unwarranted interferencein its internal affairs.   ``It is regrettable that a few people in the United States stillmake unfair criticism on China's internal affairs, and even wantChina's affairs to be done according to their will,'' China's U.S.ambassador, Han Xu, said recently.   _ Technology transfer. China is the only nation classified as``friendly and non-allied'' by the U.S. export control system whichis also subject to national security and COCOM controls whenacquiring technology with potential military uses.   Both the United States and the 16-nation COCOM, CoordinatingCommittee on Multilateral Export Control, which oversees exports tocommunist states, have moved to reduce the list of items which mustbe reviewed before being sold to China. But China, which badly needsWestern technology for its modernization drive, says liberalizationof exports has been too slow.   ``This has not only inflicted losses on China but also tied thehands of American enterprises and weakened their competitiveness inthe Chinese market,'' Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qichen said.   The United States for several months last year froze furtherliberalization of export restrictions in reaction to Chinese armssales to Iran.   _ Trade. Bilateral trade soared to about $13.5 billion last year,up from $10 billion in 1987, according to U.S. figures. But Chinaaccuses the United States of protectionism, particularly againstChinese textiles, and the United States complains about lack ofadequate protection for copyrights.   The United States supports China's application to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, but is urging China to first furtherreform its trading system to make its goods more competitive andless dependent on government subsidies.   _ International issues. Bush said his visit is not meant toupstage Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who comes to Beijing in Mayfor the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.   U.S. officials also say they welcome the normalization oflong-strained Sino-Soviet relations, which will allow both nationsto concentrate on economic reform. The Chinese say their improvedrelations with the Soviets will not affect Sino-American ties.   The United States and China both oppose Vietnam's occupation ofCambodia. Bush is likely to ask the Chinese to ensure thatwithdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia will not lead to theKhmer Rouge's return to power.   Thirty-one U.S. Congress members asked Bush in a letter to urgeChina to stop aiding the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge are blamed forthe deaths of 1 million of their countrymen during their bloody1975-78 rule over the country.   China has said it will cease aiding the Khmer Rouge when Vietnamends its 10-year military presence in Cambodia.   Bush and the Chinese leaders are also likely to discuss tensionson the Korean peninsula. China is close to the communist North andthe United States has troops in South Korea.   The Middle East, Central America and the future of China'smarket-oriented reforms as it tries to overcome economic overheatingand inflation also were expected to be dealt with.</TEXT></DOC>
