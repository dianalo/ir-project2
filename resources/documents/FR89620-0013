Management measures for 1989 were effective on May 1, 1989 (54 FR 19798,May 8, 1989). The 1989 commercial fishery for all salmon except coho inthe subarea from the Queets River, Washington, to Cape Falcon, Oregon,commenced on May 1, 1989, and closed at midnight, June 8, 1989, upon theprojected attainment of a subarea quota of 39,500 chinook salmon. Subsequentevaluation of landing data indicates that this closure was based on anoverestimate of actual catch. According to the best available information, commercial catches throughJune 8 totaled 35,000 chinook salmon, leaving 4,500 chinook salmon availablefor harvest in the subarea chinook quota. This amount of available chinooksalmon has been determined to be sufficient for three additional days offishing. This action is being taken in as timely a manner as possible forall of the remaining original season, which would have ended no later thanJune 15, 1989. Reopening of the commercial fishery in this subarea is consistentwith the management objectives for chinook salmon in this subarea. As inthe original season (May 1-June 15) Conservation Zone 1, the Columbia Rivermouth, will be closed (54 FR 19798, May 8, 1989). In accordance with the revised inseason notice procedures of 50 CFR 661.20,661.21, and 661.23, actual notice to fishermen was given prior to 0001hours local time, June 13, 1989, by telephone hotline number (206) 526-6667and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Mariners broadcasts on Channel 16 VHF-FMand 2182 KHz. NOAA issues this notice of the reopening of the commercialsalmon fishery in the EEZ from the Queets River, Washington, to Cape Falcon,Oregon, which was effective at 0001 hours local time, June 13, 1989. Thisnotice does not apply to treaty Indian fisheries or to other fisherieswhich may be operating in other areas. The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council, the Washington Department of Fisheries, and the OregonDepartment of Fish and Wildlife regarding this reopening. The States ofWashington and Oregon will manage the commercial fishery in State watersadjacent to this area of the EEZ in accordance with this federal action.Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce hasdetermined that good cause exists for this notice to be issued withoutaffording a prior opportunity for public comment. Therefore, public commentson this notice will be accepted for 15 days after filing with the Officeof the Federal Register, through June 30, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters </ITAG>This action is authorized by 50 CFR 661.23 and is in compliance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="20">(16 U.S.C. 1801 </ITAG><T3>et seq.</T3>)<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 14, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
