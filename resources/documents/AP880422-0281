The Korea Economic Daily reported that the United States wantsSouth Korea to halt sales of computers and semi-conductor chipsunder regulations of the Coordinating Committee on Exports toCommunist Countries.   Although South Korea is not a COCOM member, the paper quotedgovernment officials as saying it signed a memorandum ofunderstanding with the United States last September promising toabide by the regulations.   U.S. and Korean officials are to meet in Seoul next month towork out details of the agreement, the report said.   The United States wants South Korea to honor the agreementbeginning next month, but South Korea hopes to delay it until nextyear pending approval by its National Assembly, the paper said.   South Korea is scheduled to hold elections on Tuesday to form anew parliament. The first session of the parliament is not expecteduntil at least May.   The paper, quoting sources at the Foreign Ministry and thestate-run Korea Trade Promotion Corp., said the COCOM regulationsmay discourage efforts by South Korean firms to expand trade withCommunist nations, with which the Seoul government has nodiplomatic realtions.   It was not officially known whether South Korea currently sellsany COCOM-regulated high-tech items to Communist nations.   Unofficial industry figures show that South Korea sold about $2billion worth of goods to the Soviet Union, China and otherCommunist nations in 1986. The 1987 figures were unavilable.</TEXT></DOC>
