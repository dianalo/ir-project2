(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Software That Spans The GlobeandM;Calgon Carbon Corp. had a problem.andP;  One of the world's largest producers ofactivated carbon for environmental control systems and industrial processes,the Pittsburgh-based company acquired a German competitor three years ago.andO;But information systems at this new and important branch weren't integratedwith IS at U.S.andP;  headquarters.andM;Calgon Carbon is only one of hundreds of companies that have internationaloperations and are scrambling to find information technology products thatwill make their operations more homogeneous.andP;  Calgon's goal is to put keyinformation at management's fingertips no matter where or in what form itoriginates.andP;  No longer catering to territorial markets but to global markets,these businesses must tighten their grips on order chains so they can providecustomers with products quickly.andP;  The best way to do so, says one manager, isto use information systems that function in a seamless, integrated way anddon't limit users with disparate currencies, languages, technologies orvendor support.andM;Calgon Carbon took steps to do just that.andP;  To get its U.S.andP;  and German sitesworking together, the company replaced its aged IBM mainframe-based systemwith computers that would run multilingual integrated software.andP;  The companynow uses Digital Equipment Corp. VAXs running Tolas from GSI Transcomm, theU.S.andP;  subsidiary of France's Generale de Service Informatique.andP;  The softwareincludes more than a dozen interactive modules for managing distribution,logistics, sales, inventory and financial functions.andM;Although the conversion put Germany in phase with Pittsburgh, it alsoilluminated the need for more extensive global integration.andP;  BernardGrandjacques, Calgon's director of logistics, explains the company's muddledsituation.andP;  &quot;We had Germany set up, but the rest of Europe still had the oddmix of systems.andP;  As we became more and more international in the '80s,problems of coordinating our systems grew.andP;  For example, we work with about17 currencies in Europe, and our billing is centralized in Belgium [on IBMequipment].andP;  It was clumsy and time-consuming to convert billings between thetwo systems--the DEC in Germany and the IBM in Belgium.andP;  When Tolas's 6.4version added an option for systemwide, multicurrency processing, we decidedit would be worth it to go with one system companywide.&quot;andM;Tolas handles international tax codes and accounting standards and can beinstalled in English, French, German, Spanish and, most recently, Japanese.andO;Calgon will bring up Tolas on the VAX in Belgium on January 1, 1991 and plansto follow with conversions in France, Italy and the U.K.andP;  By the end of nextyear, Calgon hopes to standardize.andM;Grandjacques says, &quot;Since we have similar businesses in all countries, we'llbe able to find all those customers who buy the same products.andP;  We'll have auniform set of files for business planning and reporting so we can runreports instantly.andP;  And accountants will be able to do controls and studiesanywhere in the company.&quot;andM;Worldwide A Rose Is A RoseandM;Calgon chose to use the English-language version of Tolas, standardizingproduct codes in English.andP;  Screens and help menus, however, can still becustomized in different languages.andP;  End users can input data in locallanguages, and financial reporting functions are multilingual.andM;Phillipe Beaurain, president and chief executive officer of GSI Transcomm,says Tolas's multicurrency function is probably the single most importantfeature of the new release.andP;  &quot;Lots of people in IT are waiting for 1992,thinking that one big market in Europe will bloom overnight.andP;  But the ECU[European Currency Unit] won't replace the French franc or the Italian lira,at least not in the short term,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Paris to Italy is a short flightbut a long transition in cultures.andP;  People will still need to work in theirlocal languages, adhering to cultural conventions, while companies willincreasingly need to address the product as international.&quot;andM;Imperial Chemical Industries PLC is a British-based chemicals producer withmanufacturing sites in numerous countries.andP;  As business expanded, ICI'scustomers, like ICI itself, spread out their manufacturing operations.andP;  Tokeep its reputation as a high-quality supplier, ICI must ensure that theproducts it manufactures are the same from site to site.andP;  &quot;For example,&quot; saysICI's Clive Weightman, &quot;we're doing business with an auto maker that hasmanufacturing sites all over the world.andP;  We needed to develop and supply eachsite with a plastic consistent with one set of specs.&quot;andM;Getting To The CustomerandM;SAP AG, a multilingual software company based in Germany, has often seensituations like ICI's develop.andP;  &quot;ICI needed to go from procurement tocustomer in the shortest time possible through the fewest organizationalpoints possible,&quot; says Jim Bensman, president of the subsidiary SAP America.andO;When management tries to shorten the time from procurement to customer, saysBensman, they run into a smorgasbord of software and hardware platforms.andM;ICI's situation exemplifies Bensman's point.andP;  Just six years ago, the companywas running operations on a country-by-country basis with CEOs takingresponsibility for territories.andP;  That sort of territorial management madetracking and distributing products difficult.andP;  ICI replaced territorialmanagement with international product management.andM;&quot;In the mid '80s, we created a high-level, elite control group calledprincipal executive officers (PEOs) who have authority for product lines on aglobal basis,&quot; says ICI's Weightman.andP;  &quot;PEOs were located where it was mostlogical--according to market, manufacturing or research activities.&quot;andM;The PEO concept set ICI in the right direction to deal with managinginternational market demands, but information systems, structured forterritorial, not global, processing, were thorns in the sides of PEOs.andO;Rarely were these systems consistent, says Weightman.andM;International ApplicationsandM;To solve problems like ICI's, four engineers left IBM Germany to found SAP AGin 1972.andP;  ICI became SAP's first client.andP;  In 1989, with revenues of $210million, SAP was second in revenues only to Software AG among German softwarefirms, says International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market researchfirm.andM;One of the fruits of SAP's rapport with international companies like ICI wasthe development of a real-time distributed application called R/2 System.andO;Ten integrated modules provide a range of business functions for such areasas manufacturing, sales and distribution, financial management, managerialaccounting and human resources.andP;  Integration of the modules is achieved withcentral databases.andP;  Applications are supported in Dutch, English, French,German, Italian and Spanish.andP;  Portugese and Russian translations are underway.andM;Users can opt to write reports using their native languages and currenciesand then generate those reports in one standard corporate language andcurrency.andP;  SAP officials say the reports are understandable to corporatemanagers stationed around the world.andM;Big Bang, Big BucksandM;A top-down strategy is necessary for such an international system to work,says SAP's Bensman.andP;  Although various ICI sites had purchased SAP modulesover the years, it wasn't until 1983 that the company initiated a worldwideaccounting project.andP;  ICI Canada took the lead.andM;&quot;We decided to throw out about 500 computer systems and standardize on SAP'sproducts,&quot; says ICI's Weightman.andP;  &quot;No one likes to make that kind of costdecision, but the alternative was worse.andP;  We had to have a base from which wecould move forward.&quot;andP;  Over 18 months, ICI Canada worked out the conversionfrom its old systems to R/2 System on IBM mainframes.andP;  In a weekend ICI wrylyrefers to as the &quot;Big Bang,&quot; final conversions took place.andP;  On Friday,employees walked away from their old systems; on Monday, they returned to theSAP modules.andP;  Although it worked for ICI, Weightman says, &quot;I would warn anyIT manager never to start a similar conversion project without completeexecutive commitment.andP;  SAP is complex; it's not a load-and-go product.&quot;andM;Since January, several divisions of ICI have started projects that will phasein the R/2 System over the next three years.andP;  Weightman says ICI mayeventually standardize on the SAP software throughout 60 to 70% of thecompany.andM;&quot;There are significant savings for large companies when you put all your eggsin one basket, but small companies wouldn't spend the money on a relativelyexpensive product like SAP,&quot; says Weightman.andP;  R/2 System installations cancost between $100,000 and $500,000.andM;Can You Speak My Language?andM;Such sweeping conversion to standardize may be the dream of companiesinvolved in international business, but costs and technical considerationsmake it difficult for most companies to mirror ICI and Calgon's strategies.andO;However, companies are finding other ways to bring international processingunder tighter control.andM;For example, most software suppliers offer translated copies of theirmainframe, mini and PC applications, complete with user and technicaldocumentation.andP;  Many applications will accept local date and time formats.andM;Many companies developing their own applications involve third parties whentranslating their software to local languages.andP;  Digital provides this serviceand offers training to make such translations as painless as possible.andM;Numerous software and network products companies offer translation tools,screen modifiers and bilingual shells.andP;  Among the companies selling suchproducts are Ft.andP;  Lee, N.J.-based On-Line Software International Inc., whichmarkets FaceLift, a customer information control system (CICS) screenmodifier; Banyan Systems Inc., of Westborough, Mass., which offersMultilingual VINES, a UNIX System V-based virtual networking system; andDiligence Technologies of Point Claire, Quebec, Canada, which makes amultilingual network manager and an array of related electronic mailproducts.andM;Companies that market multilingual products have an edge in countries thatinsist companies provide multilingual work materials for their employees.andO;Canadian law will soon require that all of its country's businesses offeruser interfaces in both English and French.andP;  The Canadian governmentcurrently requires a bilingual interface on any system it purchases.andM;Language Is MoneyandM;Economic pressures rather than legal requirements will force businesses tooffer multilingual capabilities.andP;  For instance, the tremendous growth ofeconomic activity in Asia is beginning to increase demand for IT productsthat make the flow of data from Asia to other international centerscomprehensible.andP;  The task is formidable, considering the vast differences inand varieties of Asian languages.andP;  Taiwanese has some 30,000 characters;processing involves the use of multibyte characters.andM;Translation of Asian languages is complicated enough--but it may only be partof the challenge for IS managers involved in international business, saysFrank Luijckx, manager of global systems planning for Dow Chemical Co.andO;&quot;Software needs to run in a distributed environment,&quot; the soft-spoken managersays.andP;  &quot;Within the company, you want to operate like one global company, notlike two different companies working across borders.andP;  To be global, thesystem must be well architected.andP;  Process control, manufacturing systems,financial systems and the order chain all need to be in the same picture.andO;You can't integrate just one part of your system and then honestly call yoursystem globalized.&quot;andM;Jeannette Martin is a freelance writer based in Bowling Green, Ohio.andP;
