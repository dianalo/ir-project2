The two-hour show on Sunday is a roundup of old Western stars.Barry played the cane-carrying dandy in NBC's ``Bat Masterson'' from1959 to '61. O'Brian was the Dodge City marshal on ABC's ``The Lifeand Legend of Wyatt Earp'' from 1955 to '61.   The Western also stars Jack Elam of ABC's ``The Dakotas'' in 1963and NBC's ``Temple Houston'' in 1963-64; Johnny Crawford, who wasMark McCain on ABC's ``The Rifleman'' from 1958 to '63; CharlesFrank, who was on CBS' ``The Chisholms'' in 1979 and CBS' ``YoungMaverick'' in 1979-80; and Charles Napier of NBC's ``The OregonTrail'' in 1977 and CBS' ``The Outlaws'' in 1986-87.   The cast gives new meaning to Old West. The exception is JohnSchneider of ``The Dukes of Hazzard.'' He's along for the ride byhorse instead of gravel-spraying roadster, playing Sheriff PatGarrett, the man who killed Billy the Kid.   In ``Paradise,'' the ``over the hill gang'' comes to the rescueafter Horsley is thrown into jail on trumped-up murder charges.   ``We're a little clumsy at what we did so well 30 years ago,''says Barry, 67. ``I hope to see it come off because there could be afuture in Bat and Earp. It's a love-hate relationship, like betweenQuirt and Flagg in `What Price Glory.' Two old guys who fight andcarry on. I've always felt there's a movie in it.''   Although Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp both operated in DodgeCity, the twain never met on television, since they were ondifferent networks.   ``I would have had him on my show,'' Barry said. ``He had his ownBat Masterson. But he guarded his show with his Buntline Special.''   Barry also stars in the NBC movie ``Repeat Performance,'' whichwill be telecast in December.   The movie, a remake of a 1947 film, stars Connie Sellecca as awoman who kills her husband at midnight on New Year's Eve anddiscovers she can relive the previous year. She knows what's ahead,but can she change the climax?   Barry plays her business manager, and the story is told throughhis eyes.   The remake Barry is pressing hardest for is ``Burke's Law,'' theABC series (1963-66) in which he played a millionaire homicidedetective who drove to the murder scene in a Rolls-Royce. He hopesto see it turned into a series of movies similar to ``Perry Mason.''   Barry also starred in ``Name of the Game,'' in rotation withRobert Stack and Tony Franciosa on NBC from 1968 to '71.   He recalled that when ``Bat Masterson'' first came up 30 yearsago he didn't want to do it.   ``Then someone said he wore a derby hat and carried a cane,'' hesaid. ``That appealed to the actor in me. If it hadn't been for thatI would have turned it down. I didn't want to be tied down doing aWestern. I went to wardrobe and found the hat and cane and anelegant swallowtail coat and shiny black boots.   ``I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew exactly how to playthis man. The costume dictated my performance. It changed my life.Every role I've done since has been a guy who looked good inclothes.''   It was his stint on Broadway as Georges in ``La Cage aux Folles''that he calls ``the highlight of my life.'' He was in New York forthree years and then spent another year on the road in the Frenchfarce about a gay couple pretending to be straight for the sake ofGeorges' son, his fiancee and her parents.   ``When the role came up it wasn't a surprise because every yearI'd do a play or take off with my one-man musical revue, `Gene BarryIn One,''' he said. ``I'd try to get back to New York for a musicalnow and then. That was my `Repeat Performance.' That's where Istarted, on the musical stage.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   HOSTESS WITH THE MOST HOSTESSES _ Jayne Meadows will be the hostof hosts, in a new series of interviews that look at television'sfavorite female hosts.
