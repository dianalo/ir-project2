Ortega's plan to break off a cease-fire with the Contrasdisrupted Costa Rica's celebration of 100 years of democracy andled President Bush to hint Saturday at the possibility of renewingU.S. military aid for the rebels.   Ortega said he was ending the 19-month-old cease-fire because ofstepped up Contra attacks and accused the U.S.-backed rebels oftrying to subvert the electoral process; Bush angrily called Ortega``the unwanted animal at the garden party.''   ``Ortega is crying wolf,'' said Adolfo Calero, a Contra leaderin Miami who accused the Nicaraguan president of trying to subvertthe elections scheduled for Feb. 25.   Five Central American presidents agreed Aug. 7 that the Contrasshould be disbanded in exchange for democratic reforms inNicaragua. The accord called for the Contras to be voluntarilyrepatriated to their homeland by Dec. 8.   The Contras, in turn, vowed not to disband quietly. They lefttheir home bases in Honduras and began marching back into theirhomeland, carrying old weapons and dwindling stocks of ammunition.   ``We're sure we'll be able to make sure the Sandinistas can'tlive in peace,'' said Contra army commander Israel Galeano in alate August interview with The Associated Press at his headquarterscamp in Honduras.   Galeano said then the rebels would launch no offensiveoperations and would await the outcome of the elections.   ``If the elections are democratic, we'll go back, that's whatwe're fighting for,'' said a Contra battalion commander interviewedthen. ``But we don't believe them, that's why we're here.''   Fighting had escalated in the last three weeks in Nicaragua.Ortega said the straw that broke the camel's back was a Contraattack last Sunday that left 19 dead on the last day ofregistration for the upcoming elections.   ``We haven't been launching any attacks. We've only beendefending ourselves,'' Wilfredo Montalvan, a member of theNicaraguan Resistance's directorate, said Saturday.   ``They're always attacking us because they want to liquidateus,'' said Montalvan, who is based in San Jose.   Added Bosco Matamoros, the chief Contra spokesman in Washington,``It defies any logic that 3,000 men at the most could carry outany military operation in Nicaragua.''   In Managua, Sandinista Army spokesman Carlos Lara said thelatest Contra attack occured Friday, when a patrol of army andInterior Ministry troops was ambushed in northern Matagalpaprovince. Lara said the patrol returned fire, killing six Contras.   The cease-fire, which took effect shortly after the UnitedStates halted military aid to the Contras, was extended on amonthly basis by the Sandinistas. The current extension runs outOct. 31.   The United States, meanwhile, kept up non-lethal aid.   Scattered fighting continued at a greatly reduced scale, even asU.S. officials urged that the Contras to stay in Honduras and notto launch attacks.   Ortega said Saturday that since the cease-fire was implemented,Contra attacks had killed 736 Nicaraguans and injured 1,153 others.He also accused the rebels of kidnapping or causing thedisappearance of 1,481 people.   With even non-lethal Contra aid due to end in February, Contraofficials in Miami began to lose control and leadership was takenover by battle-hardened field commanders.   When the first Contras began marching into Nicaragua at thebeginning of September, some U.S. officials who spoke on conditionof anonymity said they feared that the powerful Sandinista armywould be able to wipe out the isolated and outnumbered Contragroups.   The Contras had about 12,000 troops in Honduras camps when theaccord was signed, and claimed another 6,000 in the interior ofNicaragua.   ``We have too much morale and not enough bullets,'' said Galeano.</TEXT></DOC>
