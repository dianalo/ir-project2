As a result, Sallie Mae said it has dismissed eightemployees, including senior management, of the unit, based inCambridge, Mass. The unit bills and collects payments onguaranteed student loans and is responsible for notifyingstate loan guarantor agencies when a loan is in default. ASallie Mae spokeswoman declined to identify the executivesinvolved or their positions.</LP><TEXT>   Sallie Mae, the nation's principal purchaser of studentloans, said the employees altered loan-collection historiesand deferment and forbearance forms, which borrowers submitto get relief from loan repayment. A loan-servicing companymust be able to demonstrate that it has taken adequate stepsto collect on the loans. Failure to take such steps couldjeopardize the loan guarantee, which in turn could result ina loss to the loan holder.   University Loan is the agent for about $350 million ofguaranteed student loans, including about $290 million heldby Sallie Mae.   University Loan Services is Sallie Mae's only separateservicing subsidiary. In addition, it has six loan-servicingcenters.   Sallie Mae said its own financial exposure would stem fromthe loans it owns on which insurance claims aren't paidbecause of the loan-servicing irregularities committed byUniversity Loan Services, as well as future claims on whichthe paperwork is found to be improper.   Sallie Mae also could be hurt if a review of claimsalready paid should show impropriety in the servicing ofthose loans. In the past four years, claims were paid on $20million Sallie Mae-owned loans that were serviced byUniversity Loan Services. The Sallie Mae spokeswoman said shedidn't have any figures on current claims outstanding.</TEXT></DOC>
