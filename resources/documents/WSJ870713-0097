Olayan disclosed a 5.3% stake in Transamerica Corp. but said the move was for investment purposes only.    The disclosure added momentum to a recent run-up in the stock price of the insurance and financial services concern, which has been a rumored takeover target. On Friday, Transamerica's stock hit a 52-week high of $45.75 a share before closing in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $44, up $1.625. It traded as low as $31.875 two months ago.    Transamerica said it welcomed Mr. Olayan's interest, and some analysts said it may actually forestall a takeover bid. &quot;It's an attempt to lock up stock in friendly hands and deter unfriendly suitors,&quot; said Herbert Goodfriend, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Corp.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, a unit of Liechtenstein-based Olayan Group said it bought 1,288,000 Transamerica common shares from May 11 to last Tuesday at $31.954 to $41.875 a share. It also has options to buy an additional 450,000 shares at option prices of $2.375 to $6.875.    Including the options and previous purchases, Mr. Olayan now holds the equivalent of four million of Transamerica's roughly 72 million shares outstanding, the filing said.    Mr. Olayan, through a spokesman, said he &quot;is a long-term investor who's supportive of management&quot; at Transamerica.    Analysts said the Olayan Group has an investment policy under which it buys into companies only when it is welcome. Over the years, it has held large stakes in various energy, insurance and financial service companies.    Mr. Olayan may be attracted to Transamerica because its results have improved since it began spinning off its manufacturing, airline and rental car units to return to its basic insurance and financial services industries, said Rudolph Martin, an analyst for Dean Witter.    In the quarter ended March 31, the company reported that profit from continuing operations doubled to $89.8 million, or $1.20 a share. Net income, boosted by gains from the sale of securities and profit from discontinued operations, soared to a record $108.2 million, or $1.45 a share.    The company is expected to release second-quarter results this week. A number of analysts anticipate the company will report higher earnings for the period. </TEXT></DOC>
