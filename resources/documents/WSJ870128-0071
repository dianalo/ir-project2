The dollar plunged more than 1% against most major currencies and fell below the psychological barrier of 1.80 West German marks.    With the dollar's recent decline as a backdrop, the Canadian dollar rallied, climbing 0.5%, to 74.49 U.S. cents in late New York trading yesterday, from 74.11 U.S. cents Monday. Exchange rates between the U.S. and Canadian currencies typically move closely together. But in the past month investor interest has grown in the Canadian dollar as the U.S. dollar has plummeted.    The heavy dollar sales came as the West German central bank intervened to support the currency for the second consecutive day in Frankfurt. Yesterday's decline also followed a Monday evening television interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. Although Mr. Baker didn't precisely say the administration wants a weaker dollar, many traders inferred that it does.    &quot;He said his usual ambiguous stuff with a smile,&quot; said Christopher S. Bourdain, a foreign-exchange adviser at BankAmerica International, New York. &quot;The implication, at least from the traders' perspective, is that he's favoring a lower dollar.&quot;    Another currency trader said that despite Mr. Baker's comments in recent television interviews, &quot;his body language betrayed&quot; his denials that the administration seeks a depreciation of the dollar.    On Monday night's MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour aired by public television, Mr. Baker said, as he has previously, that &quot;the dollar is nowhere near in a free-fall status&quot; and that its decline &quot;has been orderly and moderate.&quot; He also said that it would be bad policy for him to say what the appropriate level for the dollar should be, and later added that &quot;at some point it becomes counterproductive to see the dollar decline against the currencies of major (trade) surplus nations.&quot;    When asked about interpretations of his position as welcoming a further drop in the dollar's, Mr. Baker said, &quot;that's an unwarranted inference.&quot;    But traders were unconvinced yesterday. &quot;He claims that he isn't talking the dollar down, but he certainly isn't talking it up,&quot; said Francoise Soares-Kemp, vice president and chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais, New York. &quot;The market is full of traders who don't know what to do except test lower levels&quot; for the dollar.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7982 marks, down 1.4% from 1.8242 marks Monday. The dollar fell 1.1% to 151.18 Japanese yen from 152.80, and 1.6% to 1.5093 Swiss francs, from 1.5333.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 150.70 yen from 151.18 in New York yesterday afternoon.    &quot;Traders are extremely bearish on the dollar, and it's going to take something substantial to turn it around,&quot; said Victor Polce, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. &quot;Do I think that's going to happen? I doubt it.&quot;    Traders said yesterday's surge by the Canadian dollar continued a trend that accelerated as the U.S. currency went into a steep slide late last month. Investors, discouraged by the U.S. dollar's performance, have increasingly moved into the Canadian dollar as an alternative, traders said.    In the news background yesterday, Japan's Economic Planning Agency released statistics indicating that Japan's economic growth is likely to stall in coming months under the weight of the strong yen. The agency's leading indicator for November fell to 41.7 from 75 in each of the two previous months. Agency economists consider a reading above 50 as an indication that the economy will pick up in coming months.    An official said November's figure confirmed the agency's view that &quot;the economy will continue to be weak for some time.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.50 an ounce, to $415.50, in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 4.2 million ounces.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                         New York    Home Mkt.    New York                           Tues.       Tues.
