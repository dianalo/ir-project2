The exchange is done by oral presentations of certain projectsconcerning a particular subject followed by a discussion. This reportdeals with 6 presentations on the subject solar energy use in large watersystems and one presentation about problems with legionella (legionairbacteriae) in hot water systems. The presentations are titled: 1. Experienceswith acquisition of projects for solar energy use in large tap watersystems. This presentation is about finding three locations for the applicationof solar energy for the purpose of large scale tap water heating in thesectors medical care and recreation; 2. System studies of large tap watersystems. About resistances to introduction of solar energy in some Dutchhospitals; 3. Results of measurements from projects in Brummen and inWageningen. These projects concern installations of solar energy systemsin an institution for the mentally handicapped and in a refectory ofa students' union; 4. Legionella problems in large tap water systems.About the possible appearance of legionella bacteriae in these systemsand some recommendations for prevention; 5. Practical experiences andresults of measurements from projects in the agricultural sector (calffarm); 6. Feasibility study on large solar boiler systems in the utilitybuilding sector (hotels); 7. Investigation into a solar panel integratedwith a storage system. 13 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
