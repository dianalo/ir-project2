Webb Jr.'s Jan. 31 editorial-page article,&quot;Battlefield Success Doesn't Guarantee Victory,&quot; attempts todisparage the Gulf War by comparing it with the Mexican War.Yet the Mexican War confirmed the annexation of Texas and wonthe U.S. control of California and six other states;territory that today accounts for one-fourth of our grossnational product. It was a major step on the road to greatpower status, just as today's war to control the centers ofworld oil production is a confirmation of that continuingstatus.   Mr. Webb is wrong when he says the U.S. was not attacked.On April 24, 1846, Mexico declared war on the U.S. Thoughthis was done in secret session and was unknown inWashington, Mexico frequently had threatened war if Texasjoined the Union. On April 25, Mexican cavalry crossed theRio Grande and killed several American soldiers. On May 1, alarger Mexican force attacked what is now Brownsville. TheMexicans were defeated at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma onMay 8-9; both battles were fought north of the Rio Grande.Those who opposed the war then and since have had to sidewith the enemy and accept Mexico's claims over those of theU.S. regarding the border between Texas/U.S. and Mexico. Butas President Polk told Congress, Mexico &quot;invaded ourterritory and shed American blood on American soil.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   On current affairs, Mr. Webb is right to be concernedabout the shifts in economic/financial power between the U.S.and Japan, but encouraging Japan to take a larger militaryrole in the world would only make matters worse. The U.S.needs Tokyo's financial support in the Gulf more than itneeds Japanese troops. The coalition has the military muscleto defeat Iraq. Japanese forces would have only complicatedcoalition unity as Tokyo would have been a voice in the warcouncil for delay and appeasement. Coalitions need strongleadership if they are to act decisively; the U.S. hasprovided that due to its military preponderance.   In the long run, the U.S. should not want to see Japan (orany other nation) evolve into a military power active on aglobal scale. U.S. pre-eminence rests on the fact that it hasboth a strong economy and a strong military, a combination noother nation can match. Both pillars need to be maintainedagainst real or potential rivals. A weak Soviet economy and aweak Japanese military work to the benefit of the U.S. (aswould a weak Soviet military and a weaker Japanese economy).   Military force is the trump suit in the game of nations,and the wise player wishes to see as many of these cards inhis own hand as possible. In ancient times, Athens reachedits peak as head of the Delian League. Athens provided theleague's fleet, collecting money from the other allies tohelp pay for it. Indeed, Athens discouraged its allies frombuilding an independent military capability.   Through this policy, Athens maintained its leadership andwas able to apply the league's resources behind its ownpolicies, an edge that also benefited its commercialdiplomacy. Statesmen need to think in these larger strategicterms and not trade off long-term advantages for trivialimmediate gains or in response to emotional appeals.   William R.
