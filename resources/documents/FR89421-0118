(202) 366-4362).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>On October 13, 1987, A.A. Pierce, Director of the California Departmentof Motor Vehicles (DMV), filed an inconsistency ruling application. Thatapplication requested a ruling concerning the consistency of andSection;andSection;100.00 through 100.11 of Title 13, Chapter 1 of the California AdministrativeCode with the HMTA and the HMR. These regulations were approved by California's Office of AdministrativeLaw and filed with the Secretary of State on September 15, 1987. The following is a brief synopsis of those regulations: Section 100.00 provides that Federal standards and requirements governin the event of a conflict between these regulations and Federal statutesor regulations. Section 100.01 contains definitions of cargo tank, tank configuration,combinations of vehicles with any tank configuration, and bulk liquid load.Section 100.02 contains requirements for out-of-state drivers. These includerequirements that such drivers have received the training specified inandSection; 100.07 applicable to the hazardous material or waste being carriedand carry either an employer notice to that effect or a California Non-ResidentSpecial Driver Certificate authorizing carriage of the hazardous materialsor waste being carried. Section 100.03 provides for certificate renewals. Section 100.04 provides for exceptions to the certificate program. Section 100.05 specifies bases on which DMV may refuse to issue, or maysuspend or revoke, a certificate. Section 100.06 establishes a program for employer certification of trainingfor drivers of vehicles transporting hazardous waste, hazardous materialsor bulk liquid loads. Section 100.07 sets forth the detailed training requirements for drivershauling hazardous wastes, hazardous materials, and bulk liquids in combination.Section 100.08 describes the requirements for employer-issued certificatesof driving experience. Section 100.09 authorizes an employer to file a joint application if itmeets all the requirements of Sections 100.06 through 100.08. Section 100.10 contains recordkeeping and other requirements for employersauthorized to issue certificates of training or certificates of experience.Section 100.11 sets forth the effective dates for these regulations. California's application requested comparisons of those regulations forconsistency with section 112(a) of the HMTA and andSection;andSection; 171.8,177.800 and 177.823 of the HMR. The application also requested comparisonsof those regulations with 49 CFR 391.4, 391.11, 391.15, 391.25, 391.35,391.41, 391.43, 391.45, 391.51, and 391.65 of the Federal Motor CarrierSafety Regulations (FMCSR). Finally California's application requestedcomparisons of its regulations with certain provisions of the CommercialMotor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986. On November 16, 1987, OHMT published a Public Notice and Invitation toComment (52 FR 43016) soliciting public comments on California's application.On December 29, 1987 (52 FR 49107), OHMT extended the comment period toApril 18, 1988. Comments in support of a finding of inconsistency werefiled by the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC), 3M, Federal Express,the National Private Trucking Association (NPTA), the National IndustrialTransportation League (NITL), the American Trucking Associations, Inc.(ATA), the Electric Utility Companies' Nuclear Transportation Group (theNuclear Group), and the Department of Energy (DOE). Opposing comments,supporting a finding of consistency, were filed by the California DMV,California State Senator John Seymour and the California Trucking Association(CTA). Conoco requested that OHMT delay its ruling until the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) completed a rulemaking on Commercial Driver Testing and LicensingStandards, concerning which a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) hadbeen published by the FHWA. Conoco's request is moot because the FHWA publisheda final rule on that subject on July 21, 1988 (53 FR 27628). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Authority and Preemption Under the HMTA </ITAG>The HMTA at section 112(a) (49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)) preempts ``* * * anyrequirement, of a State or political subdivision thereof, which is inconsistentwith any requirement set forth in [the HMTA], or in a regulation issuedunder [the HMTA].'' This express preemption provision makes it evidentthat Congress did not intend the HMTA and its regulations to completelyoccupy the field of transportation so as to preclude any state or localaction. The HMTA preempts only those state and local requirements thatare ``inconsistent.'' In the HMTA's Declaration of Policy (section 102) and in the Senate CommerceCommittee language reporting out what became section 112 of the HMTA, Congressindicated a desire for uniform national standards in the field of hazardousmaterial transportation. Congress inserted the preemption language in section112(a) ``in order to preclude a multiplicity of state and local regulationsand the potential for varying as well as conflicting regulations in thearea of hazardous materials transportation'' (S. Rep. 1192, 93rd Cong.,2d Sess., 37-38 (1974)). Through its enactment of the HMTA, Congress gavethe Department the authority to promulgate uniform national standards.While the HMTA did not totally preclude state or local action in this area,Congress intended, to the extent possible, to make such state or localaction unnecessary. The comprehensiveness of the HMR, issued to implementthe HMTA, severely restricts the scope of historically permissible stateor local activity. Although advisory in nature, inconsistency rulings issued by OHMT under49 CFR Part 107 provide an alternative to litigation for a determinationof the relationship between Federal requirements and those of a state orpolitical subdivision. If a state or political subdivision requirementis found to be inconsistent, the state or local government may apply toOHMT for a waiver of preemption. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(b); 49 CFR 107.215-107.225.In issuing its advisory inconsistency rulings concerning preemption underthe HMTA, OHMT is guided by the principles enunciated in Executive Order12612 entitled ``Federalism'' (52 FR 41685, Oct. 30, 1987). Section 4(a)of that Executive Order authorizes preemption of state laws only when theFederal statute contains an express preemption provision, there is otherfirm and palpable evidence of Congressional intent to preempt, or the exerciseof state authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority.The HMTA, of course, contains an express preemption provision, which OHMThas implemented through regulations and interpreted in a long series ofinconsistency rulings beginning in 1978. Since these proceedings are conducted pursuant to the HMTA, only the questionof statutory preemption under the HMTA will be considered. A court mightfind a non-Federal requirement preempted for other reasons, such as statutorypreemption under another Federal statute, preemption under state law, orpreemption by the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because of anundue burden on interstate commerce. However, OHMT does not make such determinationsin an inconsistency ruling proceeding. OHMT has incorporated into its procedures (49 CFR 107.209(c)) the followingcriteria for determining whether a state or local requirement is consistentwith, and thus not preempted by, the HMTA:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Whether compliance with both the non-Federal requirement and theAct or the regulations issued under the Act is possible; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The extent to which the non-Federal requirement is an obstacleto the accomplishment and execution of the Act and the regulations issuedunder the Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These criteria are based upon, and supported by, U.S. Supreme Courtdecisions on preemption. These include <T3>Hines </T3>v. <T3>Davidowitz, </T3>312 U.S. 52 (1941); <T3>Florida Lime andamp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Paul, </T3>373 U.S. 132 (1963); and <T3>Ray </T3>v. <T3>Atlantic Richfield Co., </T3>435 U.S. 151 (1978). The first criterion, the ``dual compliance'' test, concerns those non-Federalrequirements which are irreconcilable with Federal requirements; that is,compliance with the non-Federal requirement causes the Federal requirementto be violated, or <T3>vice versa. </T3>The second criterion, the ``obstacle'' test, involvesdetermining whether a state or local requirement is an obstacle to executingand accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA and the HMR; a requirement constitutingsuch an obstacle is inconsistent. Application of this second criterionrequires an analysis of the non-Federal requirement in light of the requirementsof the HMTA and the HMR, as well as the purposes and objectives of Congressin enacting the HMTA and the manner and extent to which those purposesand objectives have been carried out through OHMT's regulatory program.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments Against Consistency </ITAG>Several commenters contended that the California DMV regulations are inconsistentwithout regard to whether they are applied to residents or non-residentsof California. Other commenters focused on inconsistencies which allegedlywould result if the California regulations are imposed on non-residentsof California. (Comments supporting a determination of consistency aresummarized in Part IV.) The following discussions include a summary of the general arguments madeagainst the consistency of the DMV regulations (Section A) and a summaryof the arguments alleging inconsistency based on application of the DMVregulations to non-residents of California (Section B). A. General Arguments Against Consistency <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definitions </ITAG>Citing Inconsistency Ruling 20 (IR-20), 52 FR 29396 (June 30, 1987), <T3>correction, </T3>52 FR 29468 (Aug. 7, 1987), DOE contends that CaliforniaDMV's definitions of hazardous materials differ from those in the HMR and,therefore, are inconsistent. DOE specifically cites the State's allegedly``vague'' definition of hazardous waste in sections 25115 and 25117 ofthe California Health and Safety Code; placarding requirements in section27903 of the California Vehicle Code, and bulk liquid loads in combinationas defined in andSection; 100.01(d) of the DMV regulations and sections 12804.1and 12804.3 of the California Vehicle Code. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information and Documentation Requirements </ITAG>DOE contends that andSection; 100.02 of the DMV rules is inconsistent withHMR shipping paper and information requirements because it requires informationand documentation in excess of Federal requirements. DOE says that andSection;100.02 requires non-California operators carrying certain hazardous materialsto possess either a Non-Resident Special Certificate or a notice from theemploying carrier on a State-approved form that the driver has met theDMV training requirements. Federal Express contends that DMV's andSection; 100.10, requiring out-of-stateemployers of operators to maintain training records in California, is inconsistent.Citing IR-8, 49 FR 46637 (Nov. 27, 1984), <T3>affirmed </T3>IR-8 (Appeal), 52 FR 13000 (Apr. 20, 1987), NPTA agreeswith this contention on the ground that those requirements are redundantwith Federal requirements. NITL, a shipper's transportation trade association, cites IR-22, 52 FR46574 (Dec. 8, 1987), <T3>correction, </T3>52 FR 49107 (Dec. 29, 1987), for the proposition thatinformation and documentation requirements in excess of HMR requirementsare inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR. It asserts that the DMV regulationsare redundant, place a substantial compliance burden on the private sector,and would do little to improve highway safety. NPTA and ATA argue that DMV's authority under andSection;andSection; 100.05and 100.10, respectively, to revoke a driver's special certificate or anemployer's certification number constitutes unfettered discretion whichfails the ``obstacle'' test and thus is inconsistent. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Training Requirements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">a. General Training Requirements </ITAG>Federal Express objects to the training requirements in andSection;andSection;100.02 and 100.07 and DMV's attempt to impose its training program on employersauthorized to issue certificates to drivers. It contends that the impositionof a separate training requirement which must be evidenced by a certificateapplicable only in California is inconsistent with ``the overall Federalregulation of training requirements imposed by the Department of Transportation.''NPTA contents that DMV's andSection; 100.07 training requirements are inconsistentwith the HMR training requirements in andSection;andSection; 177.800 (general),177.816 (flammable cryogenic liquids) and 177.825 (radioactive materials).ATA also alleges inconsistency with andSection; 177.800 of the HMR. NPTAargues that andSection; 100.07 is redundant with the HMR and provides theDMV with unfettered discretion to determine the adequacy of training. Thesefactors lead NPTA to conclude that andSection; 100.07 fails the ``obstacle''test for consistency with the HMR. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Radioactive Materials Training Requirements </ITAG>DOE asserts that andSection; 100.07 is inconsistent with andSection; 177.825(d)of the HMR insofar as the former applies to operators of vehicles carryinghighway route controlled quantities of radioactive materials (HRCQ). Itstates that the Federal rules require such drivers to carry a certificateof training as evidence of training within two preceding years and thatthe DMV rules require a Non-Resident Special Certificate as proof of trainingrenewable every four years, or notice from the employing carrier on a state-approvedform valid for 30 days.Likewise, the Nuclear Group alleges inconsistency of the DMV regulationswith andSection; 177.825(d), which, it states, requires drivers of vehiclescarrying HRCQ to have received, within two preceding years, training on(i) the HMR pertaining to the specific HRCQ transported, (ii) propertiesand hazards of those materials, and (iii) procedures to be followed ifan accident occurs. Section 177.825(d) also requires the driver to carrya certificate evidencing such training.The Nuclear Group argues that the existence of these specific HMR trainingrequirements makes the DMV regulations redundant, confusing, and/or burdensome.It foresees the likelihood of delays entering, or diversions around, California.Finally, the Group asserts that OHMT's decision to require specific trainingfor HRCQ drivers but not for drivers of other radioactive materials precludesCalifornia from imposing training requirements on the latter drivers. Itcontends that California should file a rulemaking petition with OHMT ifit deems such additional training regulations necessary.B. Arguments Against Consistency Based on Applicability to Non-CaliforniaOperators<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Arguments</ITAG>Federal Express states its concerns about application of the DMV regulationsto non-California operators: <ITAG tagnum="21">Federal Express engages in some transborder truck operations into* * * California and each non-resident driver on each route would be requiredto complete California training prior to driving a vehicle to a Californialocation. The utilization of a particular driver on any route cannot beguaranteed and emergency replacements are frequently necessary. As a result,this requirement imposes a substantial burden on Federal Express. FederalExpress would have to specifically train any individual who might be askedto serve as a replacement driver on the California-approved program. Thisrequirement could impair or prevent Federal Express from operating theseroutes when the regular driver is unexpect[ed]ly ill or otherwise unableto drive. </ITAG>NITL expresses its concern about the burdens the DMV regulations allegedlywould place on interstate commerce and their effect on the FHWA's commercialdriver licensing rulemaking.NPTA states that minimum requirements for training and testing of hazardousmaterials drivers must be nationally uniform rather than established andimplemented individually by states. It argues that: ``To the extent California'straining and testing regulations will apply to non-resident drivers andemployers engaged in the transport of hazardous materials in interstatecommerce, California's regulations should be ruled inconsistent with therequirements of the HMTA and the HMR.''NPTA challenges the consistency of DMV's andSection; 100.02, which, NPTAsays, requires a non-California driver to demonstrate compliance with theandSection; 100.07 training requirements and to possess either a CaliforniaNon-Resident Special Certificate or a notice signed by the driver and hisor her employer certifying that the driver has met the andSection; 100.07training requirements. NPTA asserts that these requirements fail the ``dualcompliance'' test by causing delays in transportation in violation of andSection;177.853 of the HMR. NPTA argues that this would occur because most carrierswould not license all their drivers in California and thus routinely wouldhave to delay shipments into or through California to obtain the servicesof a California-approved driver.Similarly, NPTA attacks the consistency of DMV's andSection; 100.06 concerningemployer certification of training: <ITAG tagnum="21">First, the necessity for drivers to take a written test prepared byCalifornia (presumably by Cal DMV) and administered (presumably) in Californiaposes a substantial, time consuming and costly burden for drivers and carriersalike. The labor contracts of many carriers will require them to bear theadministrative and financial expenses which the taking of a written testin California will entail. Under most agreements, the carrier would beresponsible for the driver's wages and travel expenses. Shifting such expensesfrom the carrier to the driver will not lessen or alter the outcome either.Although the operations of many carriers may be nationwide in scope, itdoes not necessarily follow that every driver employed or leased to a particularcarrier will routinely operate throughout that carrier's route system,if at all; this is one of many operational uncertainties that confrontcarriers. Obviously, the inability to identify with certainty which driverswill operate in California, when, or for how long, together with the administrativeand financial expenses associated with the taking of the written test,will serve to limit the number of drivers obtaining California licensesunder subsection (a). Thus, carriers' compliance with the requirementsof subsection (a) will, in many cases, cause unnecessary delays in transportin violation of 49 C.F.R. andSection; 177.853, as interstate shipments ofhazardous materials moving through or destined for California but not underthe control of a California-licensed driver will routinely be forced tostop at California's borders while a California-approved driver can belocated and substituted for the non-California-licensed driver.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For many carriers and drivers, these effects will not be altered bythe opportunity for carriers to obtain an employer number and issue trainingcertificates under subsection (b). First, considering the number of carriersand drivers that will have to pass scrutiny under subsection (b), therewill be a dearth of California-licensed drivers available. Thus, unnecessarydelays in transit are an inherent part of subsection (b). This problemwill be compounded by the unfettered discretion which subsection (b) appearsto give Cal DMV in determining whether an employer has met its requirements,which will undermine to some extent the speedy implementation of subsection(b).</ITAG>Likewise, the NTTC contends that those DMV regulations impose a requirementdifferent from Federal requirements and thus fail the ``dual compliance''and ``obstacle'' tests if and when applied to non-California employersor drivers. It points out that the DMV rules apply only when hazardousmaterials are being transported and asserts that the controversy concerningthem arises only because of their proposed applicability to non-Californiadrivers.NTTC also urges OHMT to take notice of section 12009(a)(14) of the CMVSA,49 App. U.S.C. 2708(a)(14), in which Congress mandates that states honora commercial driver's license issued by any other state ``in accordancewith minimum Federal standards for the issuance of such licenses.'' Itasserts that the DMV has failed to comply with the Congressional mandatefor uniform state standards contained in section 12006 of the CMVSA, 49App. U.S.C. 2705. ATA concurs with the NTTC's CMVSA argument and also supportspreemption under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (49 App.U.S.C. 2507(c)(4)).Finally, NTTC argues that California's application of its licensing requirementsto persons not holding a California license or permit violates the ``dualcompliance'' test. It describes a few scenarios to demonstrate unnecessarydelays which it claims could result from the DMV regulations and statesthat these potential delays directly contravene andSection; 177.853 (a) and(b) of the HMR:<ITAG tagnum="21">The problem comes when the Golden Bear extends its regulatory pawto drivers licensed in other states.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">California's rules (under evaluation, here) force out-of-state employersto create an administrative process just to comply with the Californiarules_a process which will require constant review and updating.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Call and demand service'' is the very essence of the for-hire tanktruck business. Typically, vehicles and drivers are dispatched on veryshort notice. Here is the core of ``unnecessary delay.'' For the purposeof illustration we submit the following scenario (based on the assumptionthat California's rules would be enforced):</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Carrier A, based in Denver, Colorado, receives an order to transportacetone from Denver to Sacramento, California, in a cargo tank motor vehicle.Driver and vehicle must be dispatched from the carrier's Pueblo, Colorado,terminal. That carrier must now sift through the following options.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) All of the carrier's Pueblo-based drivers are ``California qualified''_noproblem, no delay.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) None of the carrier's Pueblo-based drivers are ``California qualified'',and the carrier refuses the load_delay is caused because (now) the shippermust locate another carrier with appropriate equipment and ``Californiaqualified'' drivers. The delay is ``unnecessary'', because, absent theState's singular licensing requirement, the load would have been transported.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) None of the carrier's Pueblo-based drivers are ``California qualified'',but the carrier does not refuse the load_delay is caused because the carriermust obtain and complete the ``form approved by the department'' (as mandatedby CAC 100.02(e)(2)); train the driver (as mandated by CAC 100.06 and 100.07(2)(b));then, dispatch the loaded trailer. Again, the delay is unnecessary because,absent the State's singular licensing requirement, the load would havebeen transported immediately following the first customer/client contact.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Some of the carrier's Pueblo-based drivers are ``California qualified'',but those drivers are ``short on hours'' (re: Federal Hours of Serviceregulations), and could complete the trip only with an ``in service'' interruption_here,the delay is inevitable and unnecessary. Had the California rules not beenin force, the carrier would have selected a driver with a maximum numberof available hours.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Without strain, any number of variations can be constructed from thisscenario. For instance, let us assume that our hypothetical load of acetonearrives at its California destination under the steady hand of a driver``California qualified'' for ``Hazardous Materials'' (at CAC 100.07(2)(b)).However, upon arrival, the consignee rejects the load, as contaminated.At this point, the load (still in the same trailer and under the controlof the same driver) becomes ``Hazardous Waste''. Since the driver is notqualified under 100.07(a) for ``Hazardous Waste'', the carrier is facedwith a limited number of choices_all bad. The carrier could urge the consignee(now shipper) to ``cheat'' and not cut a hazardous waste manifest; or,the carrier could order the unit and driver back to Pueblo (and pray thatthe unit is not stopped for inspection); or, the carrier could order theunit to sit in California until a driver, qualified under CAC 100.07(a),can come and pick up the trailer containing the contaminated product.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In any such situation, the potential for unnecessary delay is obvious.</ITAG>ATA contends that the DMV regulations would prohibit experienced driverswho are authorized by DOT to transport hazardous materials anywhere elsein the Nation from transporting hazardous materials in California. ATAargues that this lack of uniformity is an obstacle to compliance with theHMR, especially andSection; 177.800, and thus is inconsistent with the HMR.ATA advances the following argument concerning how application of the DMVregulations to non-California drivers would lead to delays and, therefore,inconsistency with the HMR:<ITAG tagnum="21">The California regulations would create delays in the transportationof hazardous materials. A driver of a vehicle containing hazardous materialswill be stopped in California if he does not have evidence that he hasbeen trained and tested in accord with California's unique requirements.Any vehicle stopped will be delayed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are more than 3 million drivers of commercial vehicles in theUnited States. Except for drivers who never transport hazardous materialsor do not ever drive in California, each of these drivers would have tobe trained and tested to meet California's requirements. This poses realproblems for the majority of drivers affected and will lead directly todelays in transportation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">First, drivers who are owner-operators are self-employed and so wouldnot be able to turn to an employer for training, testing and certification.An owner-operator based outside of California would either have to makea special stop in California or delay the transportation of hazardous materialwhile the owner-operator is trained and tested. Depending on California'sspecific requirements, the training could take days or weeks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, motor carriers that transport cargo in California irregularlywould not want to go through the cost and recordkeeping which is requiredby California to become an employer authorized to train, test and certifydrivers. Therefore their drivers would also have to make a special stopor delay the transportation of hazardous material. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each such delay is in direct conflict with the provisions of 49 CFRandSection;177.853 that mandate that highway shipments of hazardous materialsbe transported without unnecessary delay. Such delay is also an obstacleto compliance with the HMR. As decided by OHMT in IR-22, ``hazardous materialstransportation delays * * * constitute an independent basis for finding[regulations] to be inconsistent with the HMR.'' <T3>Ibid., </T3>at 46584. Therefore, the regulations should be preempted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Precedential Effects </ITAG>Federal Express sees the DMV regulations as a forerunner to similar requirementsin all 50 states and that Company's being required to develop and maintainseparate training programs, compliance procedures and records for eachof those states. NPTA shares these views, particularly with respect totraining and records requirements. Similarly, the Nuclear Group says that hazardous materials transportationsafety is an issue of concern to all the states and that the ``regulatorybalkanization that would result from piecemeal action at the state levelto address this issue could actually decrease the safety of the interstatetransportation of hazardous materials.'' The Group contends that drivertraining requirements should be developed at the national, not state, level.3M shares these concerns about the costs to carriers and shippers whichwould result from numerous states imposing multiple standards and certifications.3M concludes:<ITAG tagnum="21">Administrative costs would increase as a result of comparing staterequirements, updating programs, certification of driver training programsby state(s), and unnecessary additional training of drivers. Increasedfees for special licenses/permits with no demonstrable benefit to the publicwill result in higher transportation costs. Furthermore, the carrier industryis already operating on competitive profit margins and it is arguable thatthe increased costs of these regulatory duplications will further financiallyburden carriers and may precipitate bankruptcies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Duplicative regulations concerning drivers training results in additionalsubstantial private costs without perceivable public benefit.</ITAG>NPTA argues that, because other states and localities will adopt theirown unique criteria for licensing drivers of hazardous materials shipmentsif the DMV's requirements are found consistent, andSection;100.02 shouldbe found to violate the ``obstacle'' test. As an example, it cites certainNew York City driver licensing requirements concerning which OHMT deferredruling in IR-22, <T3>supra, </T3>pending the outcome of this proceeding. It also cites IR-19, 52 FR 24404 (June 30, 1987), <T3>correction,</T3> 52 FR 29468 (Aug. 7, 1987), <T3>affirmed </T3>IR-19 (Appeal), 53 FR 11600 (Apr. 7, 1988), and IR-22,<T3>supra, </T3>for the proposition that the comprehensiveness of the HMRseverely restricts previously permissible state and local regulatory activity.Finally, NPTA provides the following analysis of the effect of the CommercialMotor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (CMVSA):<ITAG tagnum="21">As sections 12005 and 12006 of the Commercial Motor Vehicle SafetyAct of 1986 (``CMVSA''), 49 U.S.C. App. 2704 and 2705, so clearly demonstrate,in directing DOT to promulgate standards for the testing and licensingdrivers, including specific subject-matter training for drivers of hazardousmaterials, Congress intended ``to establish uniform standards for testingand licensing operators of commercial motor vehicles.'' H.R. Rep. No. 99-901,99th Cong. 2d Sess. 1 (1986) (``House Report''). Further, notwithstandingthat the CMVSA reserved to each state the right to impose more stringentstandards, House Report, <T3>supra </T3>at 3, section 12009 of the CMVSA, 49 U.S.C. App. 2708, alsomakes clear that this right is restricted to the resident drivers of eachstate; that as a condition of participation in the federal licensing programcreated by the CMVSA, the states are required to honor the licenses ofother states issued in accordance with the minimum federal requirements.Thus, the CMVSA is not only in keeping with the HMTA, its requirementsfor driver testing and licensing are in furtherance of the HMTA's objectives``to preclude a multiplicity of State and local regulations and the potentialfor varying as well as conflicting regulations in the area of hazardousmaterials transportation.''

Reg. </T3>760 at 761 (Jan. 6, 1983).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Public Comments Supporting Consistency </ITAG>Three commenters presented arguments supporting the consistency of theDMV regulations and rebutting the opposing arguments summarized above inPart III. Their arguments are summarized below in the same order as thecounterpart arguments were summarized in Part III. The following discussions include a summary of the general arguments supportingthe consistency of the DMV regulations (Section A) and a summary of thearguments supporting the consistency of the DMV regulations as appliedto non-residents of California (Section B). A. General Arguments Supporting Consistency<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definitions</ITAG>In response to DOE's comment that DMV is using hazardous materials definitionsinconsistent with the HMR definitions, DMV responds that the Californiastatutes containing those definitions are not the subject of this inconsistencyreview. DMV contends that its regulations merely specify which drivers_inaddition to those specified in the HMR_must receive training for the operationof vehicles carrying certain cargoes in California.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information and Documentation Requirements</ITAG>To a comment expressing concern about DMV's employer recordkeeping requirements,DMV responds:<ITAG tagnum="21">Only employers with DMV employer numbers must keep the records describedin Section 100.10(a). Employer numbers are issued only to companies whichemploy California-licensed drivers. Since the training records will, inmost cases, be kept on California-licensed drivers, the requirement thatthe records be kept in California is reasonable. DMV will be monitoringboth the training and training records for employers given DMV employernumbers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Training Requirements</ITAG>a. <T3>General training requirements. </T3>DMV presents the following argumentsin support of the consistency of its training requirements:<ITAG tagnum="21">Every attempt was made in formulating these regulations to ensurethat they do not conflict with federal regulations or unreasonably burdencommerce. Congress, by enacting the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Actof 1986, has acknowledged the need to test and ensure the fitness of commercialvehicle operators. Logically, the only practical method to ensure fitnessis to adequately train and test these drivers; the proposed regulationsand related California Vehicle Code sections provide for reasonable methodsand alternatives to train and test drivers of vehicles which pose the greatestrisk of harm, due either to the type of load carried and/or the designof the vehicle. Furthermore, California's training requirements parallelthe federal requirements so closely that a carrier who is currently meetingthe federal requirements will also be meeting California's training requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For carriers who employ California-licensed drivers, California'snew regulations establish standards for employer issuance of certificatesof training by specifying the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The conditions authorizing the Department to refuse the employerthe authority to issue training certificates or to suspend, revoke, orcancel that authority once it has been granted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The Department's authority to monitor training classes andrecords.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The procedures to provide hearings for employers whose authorityto issue training certificates is being refused, suspended, or revoked.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This regulation ensures that only qualified employers who provideadequate training and have records showing they have done so) are allowedto issue certificates of training to California-licensed drivers. Withoutthis requirement, unscrupulous employers without the resources, or evenintention, to provide adequate training would be allowed to issue certificatesof training to California drivers. The drivers for such employers wouldbe able to avoid the tests for the certificates. These untrained driverswould then be allowed to haul hazardous materials or waste or to operatelarge tank vehicles on public roads, posing a serious risk to the safetyof persons using California highways.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The provisions related to application for employer number, on departmentalforms, has no parallel in federal regulations. Nevertheless, these provisionsare not inconsistent with federal requirements because the applicationprovisions only apply to motor carriers who wish to be issued an employernumber and, as such, are not an obstacle to the accomplishment and executionof the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. These provisions place noburden on interstate commerce because applying for an employer number ismerely an <T3>option </T3>available to carriers who employ California-licensed drivers.No one is <T3>required </T3>to apply for an employer number.</ITAG>In response to comments alleging that DMV's andSection;andSection; 100.07 and100.10 provide DMV with ``unfettered discretion,'' DMV states that itstraining requirements are specific and provide clear guidance and that,likewise, the guidelines for suspension of an employer number are specific.As to the latter, DMV asserts that decisions will be made case-by-casebut that findings will be based on whether an employer met or did not meetthe DMV's regulatory requirements.b. <T3>Radioactive materials training requirements. </T3>DMV responds to commentsalleging inconsistency of its regulations with andSection; 177.825(d) ofthe HMR by pointing out that that regulation does not require a drivercarrying radioactive materials to carry a certificate of training unlessthe driver is carrying HRCQ. DMV contends that its broader training certificaterequirements help to resolve a serious enforcement problem and enhanceenforcement of the HMR. In addition, DMV states that, pursuant to Statestatute, it will recognize driver training certificates issued under andSection;177.825(d) as ``equivalent certificates.''In response to the Nuclear Group's comments that the DMV regulations areinconsistent with andSection; 177.825(d) of the HMR, DMV states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Unless and until the Federal Government adopts comprehensive trainingrequirements, enforceable through a certification process, California regulationsare neither redundant nor ``duplicative.'' California training requirementsfor hazardous materials drivers are a proper exercise of the State's policepower. In any case, the regulations do not exceed current federal trainingrequirements.</ITAG>B. Arguments Supporting Consistency of Applicability to Non-CaliforniaOperators.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Arguments</ITAG>In response to comments that application of the DMV regulations to non-Californiaoperators is inconsistent, DMV contends that such application is necessaryto identify, monitor and require training of, drivers from other stateswho transport extremely hazardous materials and wastes through Californiacities. DMV explains how it intends to facilitate compliance by non-Californiaoperators:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * California regulations provide for employer-issuance of a 30-daytemporary notice, so that an out-of-state driver may bring affected cargoesinto California when the driver has not previously had an opportunity orneed to obtain the certificate. Upon implementation of this certificateprogram, these temporary notice forms will be provided by the Departmentto employers who are licensed to transport hazardous materials or hazardouswaste in California. Copies will also be provided to administrators ofother states so that employers in sister jurisdictions will have readyaccess to this form. In addition, employers will be allowed to duplicatecopies of these forms as they are needed. This temporary notice processwas developed specifically to minimize inconvenience to the employer whileensuring that only adequately trained drivers will be transporting hazardousmaterials, hazardous waste, or bulk liquids in California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The requirements for out-of-state drivers were intended to ensuredrivers were complying with federal training requirements while minimizinginconvenience to both driver and employer. The Department of Motor Vehicleswill issue Non-Resident Special Driver Certificates to out-of-state driverswho meet the qualifications outlined in the new California regulations.The Department of Motor Vehicles will provide carriers who employ out-of-statedrivers with a form the carriers can use. On this form they can list theirout-of-state driver, check the driver's record in his home state and, ifthe driver is qualified, mail the driver a Non-Resident Special Certificate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">California's requirements parallel federal regulations by requiringthe employer to certify that the driver has met the training requirementsset forth in the California regulations. In addition, the driver is requiredby the California regulation to carry evidence of such training in theform of a Non-Resident Special Driver Certificate (or recognized equivalent).This requirement will enhance enforcement of federal regulations sinceCalifornia's training requirements are based on requirements in the Codeof Federal Regulations and enforcement personnel can immediately determine,upon stopping drivers, if they have received the required training andtest(s).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">California regulations are consistent with federal requirements inthat the employer of out-of-state drivers must certify his drivers havebeen trained in accordance with California's training requirements whichare based on federal requirements. The employer may do this on a form providedby the Department. This form will be provided to all carriers licensedto transport hazardous materials and/or hazardous waste in California.California does not intend to monitor the training given to out-of-statedrivers. Unless some evidence indicates California should do otherwise,a carrier who certifies that an out-of-state driver has been properly trainedwill be believed without further evidence required.</ITAG>In addition, DMV argues that applicability of its requirements to non-Californiaoperators is consistent with the CMVSA:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 clearly indicatesthat the Federal Government intends that states issue commercial driverlicenses and that states ensure that those commercial drivers who transporthazardous materials understand how to transport such materials safely.Under California law, the California Department of Motor Vehicles willrecognize commercial driver licenses issued in accordance with those newfederal standards. It may well be many years before an effective nationalcommercial vehicle driver license program exists. Until then, the Departmenthas a duty to protect the California public as mandated under the CaliforniaVehicle Code. California law allows the Department to exempt, from Californiacertificate requirements, any driver who holds a valid license, endorsement,or certificate from his or her state, country, or territory of residencewhich corresponds to California's certificate. Once other states developstandards for knowledge, testing, etc., that equal or exceed California's,the Department will exempt their qualified drivers from the Department'scertificate requirements.</ITAG>The California Trucking Association (CTA) provides comments supportingCalifornia's regulation of out-of-state operators:<ITAG tagnum="21">ATA makes quite an issue of the ``lack of uniformity'' and ``needfor uniformity'' issues without considering the factual situation thatCalifornia is far ahead of many states in special statutory requirementsfor the transportation, routing, packing, and retention of loads of hazardousmaterials and waste. Why should a driver from a substandard driver licensingstate be allowed to blithely operate in ignorance in California carryinga load the legislature has already determined needs special attention andcontrols?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The uniformity ATA speaks to should not lend itself to the lowestdenominator, but rather should establish a creditable basis which can beimproved upon. There has been no strong effort by ATA to challenge thespecial California requirements for maintenance of underground storagetanks by interstate carriers having terminals in California.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Yet this program which attempts to assure public protection from upwardclimb of truck accidents in California has been challenged on the basisit is an obstacle to uniform enforcement (ATA comments, Page 6, 1st paragraph).There is no such thing and can never be ``uniform enforcement of the law.''There are too many varying factors involved in such an objective beginningwith the knowledge, training, and administrative instructions to the enforcementofficer and the PARTICULAR or PECULIAR NEEDS OF THE STATE.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ``For example'' (ATA Page 6, 3rd paragraph) challenges the Californiaregulation as to minimum training requirements of ``driving and parkingrules applicable to hazardous materials transportation'', illustrates theproblem with stressing uniformity at the lowest denominator. The regulations[include] this particular statement because California statutes cover theseitems, and drivers moving hazardous materials here should not do so inignorance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is no obstacle to compliance with HMR andamp; HMTA since the Californiasystem provides for a system of employer certification (including owneroperators), reciprocal recognition of equivalent states' endorsement orcertification programs, and statewide facilities to accommodate others.</ITAG>California State Senator John Seymour provides an explanation for California'slegislative decision to apply its certification procedures to non-Californiaoperators. He describes his legislative efforts which resulted in passageof Senate Bill 895 in the 1983-84 legislative session, the prime supportprovided by the California Trucking Association, and the legislative concernsabout non-California operators.Concerning the latter issue, Senator Seymour states:<ITAG tagnum="21">In the course of moving the legislation, a number of changes weremade to meet opposition and some legislative concerns. One of the questionsregularly asked at all hearings and floor debates was: ``What about theout of state drivers? You are upgrading the California driver * * * butwill the driver from another state be at the same level?'' Recognizingthat this was a good point and also recognizing California has been a leadingstate in legislation for special statutes in transporting, handling, parking,and routing of loads of hazardous waste and materials, all of which requireadditional information beyond federal regulation. Additionally, California'stopography is sufficiently different from the driving experience of mostout-of-state drivers that we need to assure drivers that specialty vehicles(tanks in combination) are capable of meeting California road conditions.All of this was considered in responding to the legislative concerns aboutout-of-state drivers and the Vehicle Code was amended to provide the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Driver Certification: Not Required</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3103. (a) No nonresident having in his or her immediate possessiona valid driver's license, endorsement, or certificate issued by a foreignjurisdiction of which he or she is a resident permitting the operationof vehicles requiring certification under Section 12804.1 or 12804.3, shallbe required to obtain certification under 12804.1 or 12804.3, if the Departmentof Motor Vehicles determines that the law of the foreign jurisdiction pertainingto the license, endorsement, or certificate is at least equivalent to therequirements of this state pertaining to certification under Section 12804.1or 12804.3.</ITAG>This statute permits the DMV to waive their nonresident certfication requirementupon determining the equivalency of the home state certification. Thisis a reasonable approach to the problem and provides some guarantee thata driver shopping for the least difficult license to obtain will not findit to be an advantage for the operation in California. Additionally, sinceit will be a number of years before the new federal Drivers License Standardsare nationwide and upgraded, the DMV regulations provide the public safetybenefits intended by my bill.It is therefore requested that recognition be given to California leadershipin this program and that the DMV's request for acceptance of their regulationsbe approved.DMV also responded to numerous comments alleging that transportation delayswould result from DMV's regulations. First, it argues that its andSection;100.07 is ``in line with'' the intent of Federal regulations requiringthat drivers be ``trained, experienced, or instructed.'' DMV then adds:<ITAG tagnum="21">However, California recognized that often drivers are hired and sentinto California almost immediately. For this reason, the 30-day temporaryoperating notice was included in these regulations to minimize the burdenon out-of-state employers who must send their drivers into California onshort notice. The 30-day period was chosen to allow enough time for thedriver to complete his or her trip, return home, and find a DMV issuedcertificate in the mail box. DMV will issue a certificate to an out-of-statelicensed driver only when DMV determines that the driver qualifies, basedupon his or her driving record in California, as well as in other states,and upon the employer's certification that the driver has been adequatelytrained. The new employer does not have to retrain an already qualifieddriver himself, but the employer must satisfy himself that the driver isqualified by sufficient training and experience to transport the load beforecertifying that the driver has been trained.</ITAG>In response to an ATA comment that an owner-operator based outside Californiawould either have to make a special stop in California or delay transportationof a hazardous material while the owner-operator is trained and tested,DMV says: ``Drivers who are owner-operators based outside of Californiaare responsible for their own training, testing, and certification, justas they are responsible for meeting other legal requirements as a motorcarrier.'' On the issue of delays, CTA provides the following comments:<ITAG tagnum="21">The question of delay is similar to arguments previously expressedwhen California required <T3>all </T3>transporters of hazardous materials to secure a CaliforniaHazardous Permit from the Highway Patrol. Again the protection of the publicwas paramount and the inconsistency ruling was approved. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The whole issue of employer certification (including owner operators)has been misunderstood as to what will be required and the processing bythe Department of Motor Vehicles. This detail should be available fromthe department to clear up this issue. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The real issue here is: Does a state in its inherent right to protectits citizens have to adhere to lesser standards that will not provide thesafety program intended by the legislature and regulations in question.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The inconsistency ruling should be approved as was the case of thehazardous Permit requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Precedential Effects </ITAG>In response to comments that the DMV regulations constitute a precedentundermining national uniformity, DMV replies that it may be years beforean effective national CDL program exists and that, until then, DMV hasa duty to protect the California public. DMV contends that its regulations represent timely implementation of theCMVSA at the state level_as contemplated by the CMVSA. DMV provides the following response to NPTA's concerns about the potentialimpact of similar recordkeeping requirements being imposed by other statesor localities:<ITAG tagnum="21">Federal regulations require employers to keep a driver qualificationfile on each driver they employ. Information on testing and training mustbe kept in this file. Federal regulations require the employer to keepdriver qualification files at the carrier's principal place of business.However, the carrier can request, and be granted, permission to keep suchfiles at a regional or terminal office. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">California regulations also require that training records be keptby employers issuing certificates of training to their drivers. This informationcould easily be kept in the driver's qualification file. California's regulationsrequire California-based employers to keep these records at their primaryplace of business or at locations the employer designates on his applicationfor an employer number. An employer based outside of California can keepthese records at this California terminal or at other designated locationsin California. An employer who has no California terminal can keep theserecords at their primary place of business or other designated locations.California's requirements for location of these records is also consistentwith federal requirements and, in fact, should enhance enforcement of thesefederal requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">V. Ruling </ITAG>California is commended for its leadership in developing a program, statuteand regulations concerning the difficult, significant and complex issuesinvolved in the licensing and training of operators of motor vehicles carryinghazardous materials. That State is deservedly recognized as a nationalleader in these and other motor vehicle operating licensing issues. Furthermore, California deserves full credit for coming forward on itsown volition to seek an inconsistency ruling on the many complex issuesinvolved in its long and difficult undertaking. The fact that, as discussedabove, differing parties have a diversity of views on the consistency ofcertain of the California regulations is a result of the complex and controversialnature of the regulations and in no way reflects adversely on the quality,good faith and diligence of the State's efforts. In addition, California's cooperative approach to the Federalism and interstateissues involved here is demonstrated by its initial regulation under review:<ITAG tagnum="21">andSection; 100.00. To the extent that the provisions of this articleconflict with Federal statutes or regulations, the Federal standards andrequirements shall govern the activities otherwise addressed in this article.</ITAG>Finally, California has indicated in its rebuttal comment that: ``California'srequest for an Inconsistency Ruling was made to ensure that these stateregulations are in consonance with DOT's intentions. Any portion of theregulations found to be inconsistent will not be implemented.'' In summary, California has acted responsibly, diligently, openly and ingood faith to implement a high quality program in a manner consistent withthe laws executed by, and the regulations issued by, DOT. Although intended primarily to reconcile the DMV requirements with thoseissued under the HMTA, this ruling also provides guidance on the interfacebetween the CMVSA and the HMTA. It recognizes legitimate state interestsunder the CMVSA and construes the preemptive effect of the HMTA and theHMR in a manner which takes those state interests into account. The following discussion of the consistency/preemption issues raised bythe commenters is organized in a manner parallel to that used in discussingthe comments in Parts III and IV. A. General Consistency Issues <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definitions </ITAG>DOE asserts that the California statutory definitions of hazardous materialsused by DMW are inconsistent with those in the HMR. DMV argues that theState statutory provisions are not the subject of this review; however,DMV did submit a copy of the State Vehicle Code with its application forthis ruling. Although not included by DMV in its inconsistency application, it is necessaryto examine those State statutory provisions which defined terms used inthe DMW regulations at issue in this proceeding. Section 100.02, the subjectof most of the comments, provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">A driver from another state, territory, or country is authorized todrive in California without the drivers certificate required by VehicleCode section 12804.1 or 12804.3 providing the driver meets all of the followingrequirements: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>Section 12804.1 requires a special DMV certificate for drivers of motorvehicles required to display placards or makings pursuant to section 27903of the Vehicle Code or hauling hazardous waste as defined in sections 25115and 25117 of the Health and Safety Code. Section 12804.3 requires a DMV special certificate for drivers of tanktrucks required to be operated by a class 1 driver and transporting bulkliquids.Section 27903 appears to be generally consistent with the HMR because itmerely requires, with exceptions not relevant to this proceeding, compliancewith the HMR regulations on placarding of vehicles carrying hazardous materials.However, section 25115 (defining ``extremely hazardous waste'') and section25117 (defining ``hazardous waste'') appear to be California-unique definitionsdifferent from the HMR definitions of hazardous materials. This is becausethe State's definitions differ from the criteria used by the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) to define ``hazardous wastes'' (40 CFR Part 262),which ``hazardous wastes'' are regulated as ``hazardous materials'' underthe HMTA (andSection;andSection;171.3, 171.8 and 172.101 of the HMR). In addition,there is inadequate evidence in the record to determine to what extent``bulk liquids'' subject to andSection;12804.3 are or are not hazardous materialsas defined in the HMR.The Federal role is exclusive in defining hazard classes and hazardousmaterials for purposes of regulating transportation thereof. IR-18, 52FR 200 (Jan. 2, 1987); IR-18(Appeal), 53 FR 28850 (July 29, 1988); IR-19,<T3>supra</T3>; IR-19 (Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>; IR-20, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-21, 52 FR 37072 (Oct. 2, 1987); <T3>Missouri Pacific RR Co.</T3> v. <T3>Railroad Commission of Texas,</T3> 671 F.

As indicatedin IR-6, <T3>supra</T3>, at 764, ``the key to hazardous materials transportationsafety is precise communication of risk. The proliferation of differingState and local systems of hazard classification is antithetical to a uniform,comprehensive system of hazardous materials transportation safety regulations.''Under these standards, the ``hazardous materials'' definitions in sections25115 and 25117 of the California Health and Safety Code and andSection;12804.3 of the California Motor Vehicle Code are inconsistent with theHMTA and the HMR to the extent that any of them are used as a basis forregulating the transportation of hazardous materials under andSection;andSection;12804.1 and 12804.3 of the Vehicle Code and andSection;100.02 of the DMVregulations. Therefore, for purposes of this proceeding, andSection;100.02of the DMV regulations is inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR to theextent that its requirements are based upon definitions of hazardous materials(such as the foregoing statutory sections 25115, 25117 and 12804.3) notidentical to those in the HMR.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG><T3>Information and Documentation Requirements</T3>Several commenters alleged that DMV's information and documentation requirementsexceed those of the HMR and thus are inconsistent therewith. Particularmention was made of requirements in andSection;andSection;100.02 and 100.10relating to out-of-state drivers. DMV's response is that its andSection;100.10(a)requirements apply only to employers which have been issued DMV employernumbers and that such employers include only those which employ California-licenseddrivers. However, under andSection;100.02, DMV requires non-California driversto possess either a Non-Resident Special Certificate issued by DMV or acertificate from his or her employer on a DMV-approved form indicatingthat the driver has met DMV's training requirements.OHMT addressed the issue of information and documentation requirementsin IR-19, <T3>supra</T3>:<ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, the HMTA and HMR provide sufficient information and documentationrequirements for the safe transportation of hazardous materials; stateand local requirements in excess of them constitute obstacles to implementationof the HMTA and HMR and thus are inconsistent with them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">52 FR at 24408. </ITAG>In general, therefore, requirements for information or documentation inexcess of current Federal requirements, which are prerequisites to hazardousmaterials transportation, create potential unnecessary delay, constitutean obstacle to execution of the HMTA and the HMR, and thus are inconsistent.IR-2, 44 FR 75566, (Dec. 20, 1979), <T3>appeal,</T3> 45 FR 71881 (Oct. 30, 1980), <T3>correction,</T3> 45 FR 78838 (Nov. 20, 1980), IR-6, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-8, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-8(Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>; IR-15, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-15(Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>; IR-18, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-18(Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>; IR-19, <T3>supra</T3>; IR-19(Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>; IR-21, <T3>supra</T3>; <T3>Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>City of Missoula,</T3> CV 80-18-M (D. Mont. 1984). (The issue of unnecessarydelay is discussed in greater detail in Section B.1. below.)The DMV has authority under the CMVSA to prescribe information and documentationrequirements with respect to commercial drivers' licenses (CDL's) for Californiadomiciliaries and domiciliaries of those states (and foreign countries)which do not issue CDL's under the CMVSA. States, however, are not requiredto implement CDL programs until April 1, 1992. 49 App. U.S.C. 2704(b)(3),49 CFR 383.23. Thus, effective April 1, 1992, exercise of its CMVSA authorityby DMV with respect to those individuals over which it has CMVSA jurisdictionwill be consistent with the HMTA and the HMR. However, at that time, DMV'sextension of such requirements to other individuals who have hazardousmaterials endorsements on other CDL's will be inconsistent with the HMTAand the HMR for the reasons set forth above. In addition, before April1, 1992, DMV's imposition of its CDL requirements upon non-domiciliariesof California similarly is inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR for thesame reasons.Here, DMV has extended its requirements for documentary evidence of trianingto individuals over which it has no jurisdiction under the CMVSA and alsoto individuals who are not required by the CMVSA to have CDL's until April1, 1992. Such extension of DMV's requirements imposes upon perhaps a millionor more motor vehicle operators transporting hazardous materials into,through or in California an additional documentary prerequisite to thetransportation of hazardous materials being conducted in accordance withthe CMVSA, the HMTA and the HMR. There is no <T3>de minimis</T3> exception to the ``obstacle'' test with respect tothis or similar arguably <T3>de minimis</T3> documentation requirements. IR-8(Appeal), <T3>supra</T3>. As discussed below, the DMV requirements undermine uniformityof transportation regulation, create potential unnecessary delay, and,therefore, constitute obstacles to execution of the HMTA and the HMR.DMV may, consistent with the HMTA and the HMR, impose its training-relateddocumentation requirements on non-domiciliaries of California only afterApril 1, 1992, the CMVSA deadline for CDL implementation, and then onlyon non-domiciliaries who do not have hazardous materials endorsements ontheir CDL's. However, DMV's application of its documentation requirementsto other persons constitutes an obstacle to execution of the HMTA and theHMR and, therefore, is inconsistent therewith.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Training Requirements</ITAG>a. <T3>General training requirements.</T3> Several commenters alleged thatDMV's training requirements in andSection;andSection;100.02 and 100.07 areinconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR. Specific HMR training requirementswith which inconsistency is alleged are andSection;andSection;177.800 (general),177.816 (flammable cryogenic liquids) and 177.825(d) (radioactive materials).In response, DMV argues that it made every effort to avoid conflict withFederal regulations and imposition of unreasonable burdens on interstatecommerce. It contends that Congressional enactment of the CMVSA acknowledgedthe need to test, and ensure the fitness of, commercial vehicle operators.To date OHMT has promulgated few specific training requirements for motorcarriers transporting hazardous materials. Section 177.800 of the HMR requirescarriers ``to thoroughly instruct employees in relation'' to the HMR. Section177.816 prescribes mandatory training for drivers of vehicles carryingflammable cryogenic liquids, describes the training required, and specifiestraining records which must be maintained. Finally, andSection;177.825(d)requires training for all persons transporting highway route controlledquantities of radioactive materials (HRCQ); it mandates biennial writtentraining on specified topics and requires drivers to carry a certificateof training.The general policy approach of the OHMT, therefore, is that the HMR containminimal training requirements for the highway transportation of hazardousmaterials and that a state may impose more stringent training requirementson motor carrier operators so long as those requirements do not directlyconflict with the HMR requirements and apply only to individuals domiciledin that state and to individuals domiciled in other states who do not havehazardous materials endorsements on their CDL's. This approach recognizesthe significant role which states properly have in the regulation of highwaytransportation of hazardous materials_particularly with regard to trainingrequirements for their own licensed drivers.In summary, OHMT views its training requirements for highway transportationof hazardous materials as minimum requirements which a state may exceed_solong as its greater requirements do not directly conflict with the HMRor apply to individuals not domiciled in that state (with limited exceptionsdiscussed below). Thus, more stringent, more detailed or additional statetraining requirements applicable to domiciliaries of that state and notin direct conflict with the HMR are consistent with the HMTA and the HMRand, therefore, are not preempted by section 112(a) of the HMTA.None of the DMV training requirements is in direct conflict with the presentprovisions of the HMR. As applied to domiciliaries of California, therefore,they are consistent with the HMTA and the HMR. Their inconsistency withrespect to most non-domiciliaries is discussed below. b. <T3>Radioactive materials training requirements. </T3>DOE and the NuclearGroup allege that the DMV regulations are inconsistent with andSection; 177.825(d)of the HMR, which imposes training requirements on drivers of vehiclestransporting HRCQ. They argue that the DMV rules are redundant, confusing,and burdensome and stress that fact that the DMV rules apply to carriersof radioactive materials other than HRCQ.DMV contends that is broader training requirements are necessary, assertsthat its radioactive materials training requirements are neither redundantnor duplicative, and states that it will recognize andSection; 177.825(d)certificates as ``equivalent certificates'' under its regulations. The issue of training requirements for transporters of radioactive materialswas addressed by the Administrator of RSPA in deciding the appeal of IR-8:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the Department, through promulgation of 49 CFR andSection; 177.825,has established a near total occupation of the field of training requirementsrelating to the transportation of radioactive materials. Thus, state andlocal radioactive materials transportation * * * training requirementsother than * * * those identical to Federal requirements * * * are verylikely to be inconsistent and thus preempted under andSection; 112(a) ofthe HMTA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">52 FR at 13003. </ITAG>The Administrator, however, did not consider this issue in the contextof commercial driver licensing. This ruling recognizes the legitimate trainingrequirements role which states have under the CMVSA. In addition, as indicatedin the preceding discussion of training requirements in general, a statemay impose additional training requirements on its own domiciliary motorvehicle operators so long as those requirements do not directly conflictwith the HMR. The radioactive materials training requirements of the HMRare not sufficiently different from the other HMR training requirementsto justify and different treatment of them. Insofar as they relate to HRCQ, the DMV regulations do not directly conflictwith the HMR. Insofar as they relate to other placarded radioactive materials,the DMV regulations are the type of non-conflicting additional trainingregulations which states may impose on their own domiciliaries throughtheir CDL programs. Therefore, as applied to California domiciliaries, the DMV regulationson required training for transporters of radioactive materials are consistentwith the HMTA and the HMR. Their applicability to non-domiciliaries ofCalifornia is discussed below. B. Consistency Issues Related to Applicability to Non-California Operators<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General </ITAG>Several commenters contend that the DMV regulations are inconsistent withthe HMTA and the HMR insofar as they apply to non-domiciliaries of California.In particular, they focus on the andSection; 100.02 requirement that out-of-statedrivers possess either a Non-Resident Special Certificate issued by DMVor an employer's certification on a DMV-approved form and on the andSection;100.10 recordkeeping requirements applicable to non-California employers.These commenters state that there are three million commercial vehicledrivers in the United States, contend that the DMV training and paperworkrequirements for many of those drivers not domiciled in California willbe time-consuming and burdensome, and present scenarios to demonstratethe types of delays which they foresee resulting from implementation ofthe California regulations. Their conclusion is that application of theDMV rules to non-domiciliaries of California will cause unnecessary delaysin transportation in violation of andSection; 177.853 of the HMR and therebyviolate the ``dual compliance'' test for consistency. In addition, two commenters contend that the DMV has failed to abide bythe reciprocity requirements of the CMVSA, particularly 49 App. U.S.C.2708(a)(14).DMV and its supporting commenters respond that the DMV requirements reallyare not all that burdensome, that they create a standard superior to thelowest common denominator, and that they comply with the CMVSA reciprocityrequirements by providing for reciprocity if the law of the other jurisdiction``pertainng to the license, endorsement, or certificate is at least equivalentto the requirements of [California].'' As explained below, California cannotrequire such equivalency with respect to most non-domiciliaries of California.Contrary to assertions of the CTA, there has been no prior inconsistencyruling concerning any California requirements.OHMT concludes that the DMV regulations are inconsistent with the HMR insofaras (1) they presently apply to operators of motor vehicles transportinghazardous materials who are domiciled in states other than California,and (2) on or after April 1, 1992, they apply to operators of motor vehiclestransporting hazardous materials who are domiciled in states other thanCalifornia which issue CDL's under the CMVSA and who have hazardous materialsendorsements on their CDL's. The reasons for their inconsistency are thatapplication of the DMV regulations to perhaps a million or more non-domiciliariesof California is likely to result in numerous unreasonable delays of transportationin violation of andSection;177.853 of the HMR and that such application conflictswith the uniform transportation regulatory goals of the HMTA and the HMRunder the ``obstacle'' test. In addition, this option clarifies the relationshipbetween, and the combined effects of, the HMTA and CMVSA in a rationaland workable manner.Delays in transportation of hazardous materials have been of critical concernbeginning with the earliest inconsistency rulings. In IR-2, <T3>supra</T3>; transportation delays were addressed:<ITAG tagnum="21">The manifest purpose of the HMTA and the Hazardous Materials Regulationsis safety in the transportation of hazardous materials. Delay in such transportationis incongruous with safe transportation.</ITAG>44 FR at 75571. The threat of delays was discussed shortly thereafter inIR-3, 46 FR 18919 (Mar. 26, 1981), <T3>appeal </T3>47 FR 18457 (Apr. 29, 1982):<ITAG tagnum="21">The mere threat of delay may redirect commercial hazardous materialstraffic into other jurisdictions that may not be aware of or prepared fora sudden, possibly permanent, change in traffic patterns.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81"> 46 FR at 18921.</ITAG>Section 177.853 of the HMR contains two relevant provisions:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>No unnecessary delay in movement of shipments. </T3>All shipments ofhazardous materials shall be transported without unnecessary delay, fromand including the time of commencement of the loading of the cargo untilits final discharge at destination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Delivery at destination. </T3>Shipments of hazardous materials whichare refused by the consignees, or which can not be delivered within 48hours after arrival at destination, must be promptly disposed of (1) byreturn to the shipper, if in proper shipping condition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>In light of the massive numbers of hazardous materials transportation movementsand drivers involved therewith, numerous unreasonable chronic and acutedelays of such transportation are likely to occur if the DMV rules areapplied to non-domiciliaries of California. The scenarios described aboveby the out-of-state industry commenters graphically illustrate the typesof delays which are likely to occur once hazardous materials are in commerceif the DMV rules are applied to non-residents. Numerous non-Californiadrivers unaware of the DMV requirements are likely to be stopped at theCalifornia border or in California and their hazardous materials movementssignificantly delayed because of their failure to comply with the DMV trainingand related documentation requirements. The likelihood of these delaysrenders application of the DMV rules to most non-domiciliaries of Californiainconsistent with andSection;177.853, the primary intent of which is to reducethe number of hazardous materials incidents by minimizing the time in transitof hazardous materials.To the extent that the DMV is imposing documentary prerequisites for thetransportation of hazardous materials upon persons over whom it does nothave CDL licensing jurisdiction and upon other non-domiciliaries beforethey are required by the CMVSA to have CDL's and hazardous materials endorsementsthereon, the DMV is creating unnecessary delays in the transportation ofhazardous materials in commerce. Systemic ``permitting'' requirements,like DMV's documentary regulations, can cause chronic delays during transportationand have been found to be inconsistent with the HMR. IR-19, IR-19(Appeal),IR-21, IR-22, all <T3>supra. </T3>In addition, application of those requirements to motorvehicle operators arriving at the California border with hazardous materialsand without the DMV-required documentation would result in numerous acutedelays as a search was undertaken for a ``qualified'' driver. The likelihoodof such acute delays results in the DMV requirements being inconsistentwith andSection; 177.853 of the HMR.This situation is clearly distinguishable from that considered in <T3>New Hampshire Motor Transport Assn. </T3>v. <T3>Flynn, </T3>751 F.2d 43 (1st Cir., 1984). In that case, the Court ofAppeals for the First Circuit determined that New Hampshire's $15 singletrip/$25 annual hazardous materials transportation license fee was consistentwith the HMTA and that delays incident to paying those fees were not ``significantenough to interfere with the federal speedy-transport mandate.'' A motorcarrier merely had to pay a fee at the border during business hours orotherwise pay in advance. Given that there are a million or more non-Californiaindividual operators, a non-California motor carrier would have to either(1) ensure that its drivers obtain a California DMV Non-Resident SpecialCertificate (which involves testing in California), or (2) issue to eachof those drivers a California-approved form indicating that the driverhas met California's training requirements and send a copy of the CaliforniaDMV. In other words, a non-California motor carrier must be prepared eitherto send its drivers into California for training or to establish a California-approvedtraining program and comply with California DMV recordkeeping requirements.It is unclear whether or how a self-employed trucker could be approvedother than by being tested in California. The delays inherent in applicationof the DMV requirements to non-domiciliaries of California, therefore,are significant. That significance renders them inconsistent with andSection;177.853 of the HMR under the ``dual compliance'' test and also inconsistentwith the uniform transportation regulatory goals of the HMTA and the HMRunder the ``obstacle'' test.As a matter of regulatory policy, OHMT is dovetailing its regulatory requirementsand practices under the HMTA with those of the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) under the CMVSA. The latter statute provides for a single commercialdriver's license (CDL) for each driver of a commercial motor vehicle. Section12009(a)(14) of that Act, 49 App. U.S.C. 2708(a)(14), and an implementingFHWA regulation, 49 CFR 383.73(b) (53 FR 27628, 27651; July 21, 1988),require states to extend reciprocity to CDL's issued by other states.Under the FHWA rules (including 49 CFR 383.121 on hazardous materials endorsements)and this ruling (applying the ``dual compliance'' and ``obstacle'' testsfor consistency with the HMTA and the HMR), a state may impose more stringenthazardous materials training requirements on its own domiciliary commercialmotor vehicle operators than do Federal regulations so long as those requirementsdo not directly conflict with Federal regulations_but may not do so withrespect to a motor vehicle operator who has been issued another state'sCDL with a hazardous materials endorsement thereon and also may not doso with respect to a non-domiciliary operator prior to April 1, 1992. DMVerroneously asserts that it has authority to determine whether anotherstate's hazardous materials endorsement requirements are adequate; in fact,the authority to make that determination rests with the FHWA under theCMVSA.In summary, application of the DMV regulations to (1) domiciliaries ofstates other than California prior to April 1, 1992, and (2) to domiciliariesof states other than California who have hazardous materials endorsementson their CDL's in or after April 1, 1992, is inconsistent with the HMTAand the HMR under both the ``obstacle'' and ``dual compliance'' tests,and, therefore, such application is preempted.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Precedential Effects</ITAG>Several commenters perceive the DMV regulations as harbingers of a Balkanizedregulatory approach under which operators of vehicles carrying hazardousmaterials would be subject to 50 separate state hazardous materials licensingstandards.One quoted the legislative purpose for the HMTA preemptive provision: ``topreclude a multiplicity of State and local regulations and the potentialfor varying as well as conflicting regulations in the area of hazardousmaterials transportation.'' S. Rep. No. 93-1192, 93d Cong. 2d Sess. 37(1974).DMV, on the other hand, contends that it is implementing the CMVSA at thestate level in a timely and effective manner and that it may be years beforean effective national CDL program exists.As discussed in IR-17, 51 FR 20925 (June 9, 1986), and in IR-17 (Appeal),52 FR 36200 (Sept. 25, 1987), <T3>correction </T3>52 FR 37399 (Oct. 6, 1987), OHMT and RSPA have neverrelied upon the potential cumulative effects of a requirement as a basisfor finding inconsistency. They have, however, discussed such potentialeffects to illustrate adverse impacts of requirements already found inconsistent.Likewise here, OHMT's ruling, that application of DMV's rules to most non-domiciliariesof California is inconsistent, should help to avoid a chaotic and burdensomesituation in which numerous states would apply separate and possible conflictingrequirements on persons engaged in the transportation of hazardous materials.Such a situation could result in a company having to develop training programsand issue training-related documents meeting the requirements of the 49separate continental states.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Summary of Ruling</ITAG>For the foregoing reasons and on the basis of this record, I make the followingfindings. Sections 100.00-100.11 of Title 13, Chapter 1 of the CaliforniaAdministrative Code presently are inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMRto the extent that they apply to operators of motor vehicles transportinghazardous materials who are domiciled in states other than California.Effective April 1, 1992, those regulations will be inconsistent with theHMTA and the HMR to the extent that they apply to operators of motor vehiclestransporting hazardous materials who are domiciled in states other thanCalifornia which issue commercial drivers' licenses (CDL's) under the CommercialMotor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (49 App. U.S.C. 2701-2716) (CMVSA) andwho have hazardous materials endorsements on their CDL's. In addition,andSection;100.02 of those regulations is inconsistent with the HMTA andthe HMR to the extent that its requirements are based upon definitionsof hazardous materials not identical to those in the HMR. Otherwise, thoseregulations, however, are consistent with the HMTA and the HMR. To theextent those regulations are inconsistent with the HMTA and the HMR, theyare preempted under section 112(a) of the HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)).Any appeal of this ruling must be filed within 30 days of service in accordancewith 49 CFR 107.211.<ITAG tagnum="6">Alan I.
