Traditionally, x-ray imaging techniquesin dynamic testing have relied on extremely short pulses of radiationto freeze the motion of the object, and then recording the image on filmby means of fluorescent intensifying screens to obtain sufficient imagedensity on the film. This results in images often limited only by theresolution of the film-screen combination, which are usually of reasonablequality. In a cineradiography system, two basic differences are evident.First, the radiation source emits continuously for the duration of theexperiment. Second, the film is replaced by a gated, intensified televisioncamera focused on the fluorescent screen. The image is frozen by theshort gate time of the camera, rather than by the short pulse of radiation.</TEXT></DOC>
