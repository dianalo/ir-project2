The presidential pardon is one &quot;line item&quot; veto requiring no constitutional amendment. Congratulations, also, to Hamilton for the 74th and to Madison for the 47th and 48th Federalist newspaper essays explaining those original constitutional principles.    George F. Barbary   Attorney Dallas   ---   Your editorial is very offensive. Messrs. North and Poindexter and others betrayed the honor of the nation, especially in selling armaments to one of our worst enemies, Iran. The excuse that they felt they were doing what the president wanted doesn't carry. When you are sworn in as members of the armed service (as I was in World War II), you swear to uphold the laws and the Constitution of the United States. The honor of the nation is at least as great an asset in defending freedom as the military hardware.    Ward McCabe   San Jose, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
