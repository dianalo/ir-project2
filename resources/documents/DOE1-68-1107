<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-1107 </DOCNO><TEXT>N-(2-Hydroxy-1-naphthylidene)glycine has been isolated as its stablerpotassium salt, which yielded Cu(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Mn(II),Zn(II), Fe(III), Co(III), Mn(III), V(IV), Th(IV) and U(VI) complexes.These were characterised through their elemental, analytical, molar conductance,magnetic susceptibility and thermogravimetric data. On the basis of uv,ir and nmr spectral evidences, the ligand moiety has been shown to existpredominatingly in the quinoneamine form and to bond to metal ions throughits quinone oxygen, deprotonated amino nitrogen and a carboxylate oxygen.This structure is supported also by available crystallographic data ofrelated complexes.
