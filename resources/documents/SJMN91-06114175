There is only one day for mothers and no day forwives. There should be some other way to reward secretaries for a job welldone, other than a social lunch with several drinks before.;    I have beenboth. As a secretary, I kept a very businesslike relationship, and mypresident or vice-president boss never took me to lunch; however, I plannedmany lunches for him.;    I was not a wallflower, having spent some time as amodel, and I have a degree from a prominent university. I knew their wives andhad great respect for them. I don't find myself now in a similar situation totheirs, and I feel that secretaries are going too far.; GENTLE READER -- MissManners tries not to get personal with the etiquette questions, but feelsobliged to point out that your problem is not with secretaries -- yourhusband's or anyone else's. Your problem is with your own present occupation.;   Nowadays, ladies who can afford to stay at home with their childrengenerally do so because they find this satisfying. Such a person would not,however, refer to domestic life in the loaded terms you use.;    As you are atrained secretary, Miss Manners suggests you might want to return to beingone, rather than blaming your husband for your dissatisfaction with your shareof his attention.; DEAR MISS MANNERS -- This may be a dumb question, but I ama recent widower and would like to know what common practice is regarding thewearing of my wedding ring. Does one continue to wear the ring on the lefthand, transfer it to the right hand -- any preferred finger? -- or ceasewearing it?;    GENTLE READER -- Etiquette has a great deal less interest inthe wearing of rings than a great many people seem to think. You may continueto wear the ring on the left hand as long as you like.;    The only guidelineMiss Manners has to offer is to remind you that the wedding ring is a symbol,and that people generally interpret it as such. Thus a widowed person whocontinues to wear one will be perceived as uninterested in acquiring anotherone.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Miss Manners column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910423  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  514  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 23, 199100114175,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
