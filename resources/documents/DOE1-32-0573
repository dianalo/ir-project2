The objectivewas to obtain information on levels of radioactive caesium in peoplein the area, to complement measurements on the environment and foodstuffs.Body contents of radioactive caesium were measured with a relativelysimple, mobile whole-body monitor. In almost all cases the amount ofradioactive caesium in the body was less than the limit of detectionof the measurement technique (typically 370 Bq) and in all cases below500 Bq. Results indicate the average level of radioactive caesium inthe measured population is less than that generally found in those areasof the UK where there was extensive enhanced deposition of Chernobylfallout, and probably no greater than that typical of southern and easternparts of the UK (200 Bq). Enhanced levels of radiocaesium were not foundin people who regularly consume locally produced milk, lamb or vegetables.The results confirm that there is no cause for special concern in thisarea.</TEXT></DOC>
