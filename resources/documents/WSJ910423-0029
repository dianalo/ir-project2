But lately oilshares have perked up, rising 3.3% in the first three weeksof April.   No shocking drama is roiling the world's oil markets. Andthat is just the point. It has dawned on investors that thegloomy predictions of a few months ago haven't come true, atleast so far.</LP><TEXT>   In the early days of the Persian Gulf crisis, some peoplesuggested that oil prices might tumble to as low as $10 abarrel after the war, as renewed production by Kuwait andIraq filled the world's tanks to the sloshing point. Later,strategists became a bit more optimistic and projected that$15 a barrel would be the floor.   So far, nothing of the sort has happened. Instead, theprice of crude oil has held close to $20 a barrel. (Forexample, light sweet crude traded in the futures marketyesterday for $21.62 a barrel.)   For oil producers, that isn't a great price, but it's adecent one. For refiners and gasoline marketers, relativelystable prices are a blessing, enabling them to plan their ownpricing rationally. In short, this isn't heaven, but it sureisn't the other place.   Of course, the world isn't yet buying any Iraqi oil, andKuwait's fields remain badly damaged by the war. W. WayneBurgan, chief investment officer for Reinhart-Burgan CapitalManagement in Naples, Fla., points to several other reasonsoil prices are holding firm.   &quot;The Soviet situation is deteriorating much faster thananybody realized,&quot; Mr. Burgan says. &quot;Growth {in oilconsumption} on the Pacific Rim is outstripping what mostpeople expected. And I don't think that our oil consumptionhas dropped nearly as much as the bears expected,&quot;considering the U.S. is in a recession.   &quot;Saudi Arabia is in the driver's seat,&quot; Mr. Burgan says.&quot;It is in their interest to maintain {a price of} $19 to$20.&quot; He has major holdings of Exxon and Texaco, and latelyhas been buying USX and Du Pont, each of which has major U.S.oil operations.   Marion Dixon, who manages the Decatur funds at DelawareManagement Co. in Philadelphia, has close to 10% of hisportfolio in Texaco, Exxon, Mobil and Amoco. &quot;Today, youcouldn't build a {new} refinery,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm veryinterested in owning a domestic refining capability. Most ofthese refineries have gotten to be very efficient, aftergetting beaten up rather badly in the early '80s.&quot;   &quot;We're probably about halfway through the recovery&quot; inoil-share prices, says William Brown III, oil analyst forKidder Peabody. Analysts generally say the stocks don't offera chance for a killing, but with solid dividend yields willprobably offer good total returns.   Oil stocks don't tend to race up and down in tandem withthe market as a whole -- which may have been a comfortingthought to investors when the Dow Jones Industrial Averagefell 33.67 points Friday and 37.87 points yesterday. &quot;We liketo have oil stocks in the portfolio because they arefantastic at reducing the volatility,&quot; says Alan Outlaw, aprincipal at Justin Asset Management in Arlington, Va.   Which stocks to pick? Companies with refining andmarketing operations in the Far East and Europe should showsome of the best results for the rest of this year, analystssay.   That leads to U.S.-based internationals such as Exxon,Mobil and Texaco, as well as foreign companies includingRoyal Dutch Petroleum (Netherlands), Repsol (Spain), ShellTransport andamp; Trading and British Petroleum (both British).These foreign companies trade on the New York Stock Exchangein the form of American depositary receipts, or ADRs.   As the table accompanying this article shows, the foreignoils generally sell at somewhat lower price/earningsmultiples than the domestic petroleum companies. And some ofthem have outstanding balance sheets. The disadvantage isthat information on them is harder to come by than withdomestic companies, and accounting standards vary amongcountries.   Operation Desert Storm soaked up huge quantities of&quot;middle distillate&quot; products such as jet fuel, kerosene anddiesel fuel. Saudi refineries, which typically supply theseproducts to the Far East as well as Europe, were unable to doso because they were supplying Allied forces.   During January and February, refining profit marginsoverseas expanded tremendously. For example, refiners inEurope were averaging about $9 of profit per barrel of oil.In March, once the war was over, the margin sank back toabout $4.50 -- still considered a hefty profit.   Oil-product inventories world-wide are tight, which willhelp keep crude prices from sagging too much in recession.And when world economies finally pick up, the lean supplysituation could trigger a fast rise in oil prices. Demand forgasoline is growing fastest in the Far East, particularly inKorea. Companies well-positioned to take advantage of thisinclude Mobil, and the combination of Texaco and Chevronthrough their Far Eastern joint venture, CalTex.   U.S. gasoline inventories are the smallest in almost 16years. For the moment, though, several analysts say Chevron,Atlantic Richfield and Unocal won't be major beneficiaries.Gasoline price wars have been raging on the West Coast.Analysts say this battle will temper earnings at Chevron andAtlantic Richfield. Unocal, with little overseas exposure,&quot;will be really hurt,&quot; says Eugene Nowack of Dean Witter.   Amoco is a special case because of its heavy involvementin natural gas. Prices for natural gas have been weak, andsome capacity now is starting to close down. Several moneymanagers say they hesitate to load up on the stock until theysee more evidence of a turnaround in natural gas. But for thevery same reasons, some analysts say Amoco is a goodlong-term investment. They note that after a few warm wintersin a row, a cold one has to arrive sometime. And natural gasis a cleaner-burning fuel than oil.   Mobil and Chevron also are strong in natural gas. Theyhave more diverse operations abroad than Amoco, a factor thathelps them weather downturns in natural gas prices. Expectingprices to rise in the future, both companies made largeacquisitions of natural gas properties in the 1980s. Mobilbought Superior Oil and Chevron purchased natural gasproperties from Tenneco.   ---   ConAgra's plan to acquire Golden Valley Microwave hasbloodied a crowd of short-sellers expecting a drop in thestock of the microwave-popcorn concern.   Golden Valley surged 7 5/8 to 24 1/2 yesterday afterConAgra agreed on a stock swap valued at $26.39 a share.Volume hit nearly 1.8 million shares as short-sellersscrambled to cover their bets at a loss. In a short sale,people sell borrowed stock, hoping to profit from a laterdecline in the stock price that would allow them to returncheaper shares to the lender.   In mid-April the total amount of Golden Valley shares soldshort stood at 1,980,000, about 38 days' worth of averagetrading volume and about 15% of all the company's publiclytraded stock. Before the ConAgra announcement, the shortswere making a bet that Golden Valley would plummet on itsfirst-quarter earnings announcement, due out today. Analystswere estimating first-quarter profit at 26 cents a share, 26%below the year-earlier period.   Ronald B. Morrow, a Smith Barney managing director who hasrecommended the stock for two years, once received a body bagwith a plastic skeleton inside that had a not-so-subtleresemblance to Golden Valley's chairman. Another day, ananonymous caller phoned Smith Barney's head of research andwhispered that Mr. Morrow's recommendation would put theentire firm in jeopardy.   The shorts &quot;made it difficult for anybody who had a buyrecommendation on the stock,&quot; Mr. Morrow says. But now thegame's over, and the shorts have lost. Among the winners:Dietche andamp; Field Advisers Inc., New York, which holds1,074,800 shares of Golden Valley. The investment firmdeclined to comment on its holdings.                                                                                                          -- Craig Torres   ---                          The Oil Giants                                                                                                                                    1990     LONG-      PRICE/                            SALES     TERM     EARNINGS COMPANY             (In billions)    DEBT*   MULTIPLE**                                                                                                        Royal Dutch/Shell       $106.4        8%         11 Exxon                    105.5       19          15 British Petroleum         58.3       32          10 Mobil                     57.8       20          13 Texaco                    40.9       32          12 Chevron                   38.6       31          13 Amoco                     28.0       27          13 Occidental Petroleum      21.7       58          15 Atlantic Richfield        18.8       45          11 Repsol (Spain)            15.0        4          11                                                                                                          *As percentage of total capital   **Stock price divided by past four quarters' per shareearnings</TEXT></DOC>
