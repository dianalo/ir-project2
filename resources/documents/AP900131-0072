Opposition groups have angrily criticized the ruling NationalSalvation Front, which assumed power during the bloody Decemberrevolt that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu, for reneging on its promiseto run Romania only until the May 20 elections.   They had demanded the interim government not field candidates inelections it will oversee and accused it of trying to establishone-party rule.   On Tuesday, the interim government said it would share poweruntil the elections and split into two groups _ one to govern andthe other to contest elections.   The opposition National Liberal Party said the move failed toanswer its objections because it would still be running thegovernment and participating in elections.   ``This is illegal. We asked the Front to transform itself into apolitical party,'' party spokesman Nicolae Enescu told TheAssociated Press. ``If it takes part in elections and representsthe interests of the state, it seems like a dictatorship again.''   The other major opposition group, the 260,000-member NationalPeasant Party, charged that if the Nationl Salvation Front wins, itwill establish another Communist dictatorship ``with a human face.''   Critics noted that the Front controls the military, bureaucracyand industry and has restricted opposition access to the mass media.   Senior Front member Silviu Brucan offered the coalitiongovernment and announced the split in comments to selectedreporters, a transcript of which was made avaliable to TheAssociated Press.   The concessions follow growing public dissatisfaction with theFront's ruling tactics and international criticism of it forallowing pro-government demonstrators to besiege the headquartersof two opposition parties on Monday.   Opposition leaders claimed they had been the target ofgovernment-organized harassment, noting that many of the protesterswere workers who arrived in the capital in government-owned trucksand buses.   On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department accused the Front ofintimidating the opposition and said department human rightsdirector Richard Schifter was in Bucharest ``forcefully stating ourconcerns.''   ``We are deeply troubled by what appears to be activeintimidation of legitimate organizations which are seeking alegitimate, independent role in Romania's new political order,''State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington.   Schifter met with opposition leaders Tuesday and was to conferwith key government figures today.   The demonstrators Monday broke into Liberal Party headquartersand surrounded the offices of the National Peasant Party, forcingits president to flee in an armored personnel carrier provided byauthorities.   On Sunday, thousands of protesters had converged on governmentheadquarters, demanding the Front share power or resign.   Many opposition groups have accused the Front _ which iscomposed of military officers, intellectuals and disaffectedCommunists _ of seeking to continue Communist rule.   Brucan declared Tuesday:   ``We believe it is illegal for the Front to hold political powerand take part in elections at the same time.   ``That is why we have split into a provisional National Council,to hold legislative power on the one hand, and the NationalSalvation Front, which is to take part in the elections as apolitical organization, on the other.''   He said the government would suggest opposition parties ``takepart in the provisional National Council in order to guarantee theobjectivity of the elections,'' when talks between the governmentand opposition resume Thursday.   In other developments, a military tribunal was told thatCeausescu's defense minister, Vasile Milea, was not killed onCeausescu's orders as had been believed but killed himself ratherthan give orders to fire on anti-Ceausescu demonstrators.   Milea has become a hero of the Romanian revolution for trying tokeep the army from firing on unarmed demonstrators, as ordered byCeausescu.   His death helped turn army units against Ceausescu in thepopular uprising that ended the dictator's brutal 24-year rule.   At the trial of four close associates of Ceausescu, Col.Corneliu Pircalabescu testified that Milea asked him to tell hiswife and children he couldn't order defenseless demonstratorskilled. Minutes later, he shot himself in the heart, saidPircalabescu, head of the civilian reserve force.   Pircalabescu is not a defendant in the trial.   His testimony, some of the most moving in the three-day trial,contradicted an account Monday by defendant Emil Bobu that thedictator ordered the general's assassination for opposing the orderto shoot. Bobu was the No. 3 official in the Ceausescu government.   The trial, which began Saturday, was adjourned until Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
