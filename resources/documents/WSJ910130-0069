Kenneth Kizer, director of California's health department,sent letters to the nine-campus University of Californiasystem, Stanford University, the University of SouthernCalifornia, the State Teachers' Retirement System and thePublic Employees' Retirement System, to &quot;strongly encourage&quot;their elimination of tobacco-related holdings &quot;in theinterest of promoting health.&quot; The four institutions combinedhave at least $546 million in such investments, the healthdepartment said.</LP><TEXT>   By doing so, California appears to be the first statepublicly to prod institutions within its borders to divestthemselves of tobacco stocks. Health officials elsewhere sawit as a sign that the movement to push institutions to divestsuch stocks is gaining.   &quot;This is a courageous statement for any public official tomake. He should be commended for doing so,&quot; said RonaldDavis, director of the U.S. government's Centers for DiseaseControl office on smoking and health. He said that thesurgeon general hasn't called for companies to divestthemselves of tobacco stocks but that &quot;the movement isgaining ground, slowly.&quot;   Already, according to the Boston-based Tobacco DivestitureProject, Harvard University and the City University of NewYork have decided to divest themselves of such stocks, takingthe action last summer. The city of Pittsburgh and the RobertWood Johnson Foundation followed. The Tobacco DivestitureProject, a nonprofit advocacy group, said four statelegislatures -- in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania andOregon -- have had bills introduced recently calling fordivestitures.   Dr. Kizer's letter-writing campaign is part of what isbelieved to be the biggest state offensive ever againstsmoking.   The California campaign, begun last year and initiallyfunded at $221 million, is the first to use marketingtechniques funded by cigarette taxes to try to cut, andeventually eliminate, tobacco use. In October, the healthdepartment said its ground-breaking advertising blitz againstcigarettes had helped to almost double the rate at whichpeople in the state have quit smoking. Many of the ads depictsmoking as a dirty, disgusting habit, while others attacktobacco-industry executives as callous, profit-motivatedpurveyors of deadly products.   Various companies with tobacco-industry holdings have beencountering such efforts as Dr. Kizer's by saying they arediversified concerns and draw a majority of their revenuefrom food or other products. Some note that hurting tobaccocompanies could also cost Americans jobs, and suggest thatinstitutions should invest with profit in mind at least asmuch as morality.   George Knox, vice president of public affairs of PhilipMorris Cos., countered the movement by saying: &quot;There is noindustry or business where there are not some socialconcerns.&quot; When institutions mulling a possible divestiturecall him, he said, he observes that to be truly sociallyresponsible, they might also have to divest themselves of anycompanies that use animal testing, for example. What's more,he added, &quot;I wish them luck in finding investments that havebeen as good as ours.&quot;   Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute,declined to comment on California's latest actions, but notedthat both Montana and Oregon voters last year rejectedinitiatives that would have boosted cigarette excise taxes tofund similar anti-cigarette campaigns there.   University of Southern California treasurer WilliamHromadka, after receiving Dr. Kizer's letter, said theuniversity's committee on investments and socialresponsibility would consider the tobacco issue this spring.   In an interview, Dr. Kizer said he hoped the letters &quot;willact as a trigger to stimulate debate and discussion on thisissue.&quot; He added that he would write to other universitiesand retirement funds but would focus on public Californiaentities. &quot;It is ironic that our public agency is engaged inan anti-smoking effort while other branches of government areinvesting in tobacco companies. The two don't add up,&quot; hesaid.   The Centers for Disease Control's Dr. Davis expects thatnationally, similar anti-tobacco-investment efforts willfocus on medical institutions. In the early 1980s, theAmerican Medical Association sold its tobacco-stock holdingsand urged medical schools to do the same.   &quot;Any institutions that have a public position in favor ofhealth care are in an untenable position to maintain thesestocks in their portfolio,&quot; said Dr. Davis. Statistics hecited indicate that 390,000 deaths, or one of every six inthe U.S. each year, result from diseases caused by smoking.&quot;It is only a matter of time before significant pressure isbrought to bear on institutions to divest themselves oftobacco stocks,&quot; he said.   Brad Krevor, executive director of the Tobacco DivestmentProject, sees the anti-tobacco battle as an easier one thanefforts to get institutions to sell their SouthAfrica-related stocks. He says that 800,000 are employed bythe tobacco industry, but those dying from smoking-relateddiseases in the U.S. equal nearly half that number. &quot;Onedeath for every two jobs is too high a price to pay,&quot; hesays. His group will now urge other universities, pensionfunds, and philanthropic organizations to sell their tobaccostocks. They will next focus on politicians who takecontributions from such companies, and newspapers andmagazines that run tobacco-company related advertisements.</TEXT></DOC>
