Among these materials however, and for variousreasons, only glass has been developed to the industrial process stage.Different techniques have been investigated in a number of countries,principally in West Germany, the USA, the UK, Belgium, Japan, Franceand India. These techniques may be classified into four categories: batchprocesses involving prior calcining or other preliminary treatment; directvitrification batch processes; continuous processes with a preliminarycalcining step; continuous direct vitrification processes. In order tomeet the requirements of existing reprocessing plants (600-1000 metrictons of fuel per year) or to solidify the significant backlog accumulatedon certain sites over the years, continuous processes have been the mostwidely adopted. The technique using a preliminary calcining step wasdeveloped in France and has been adopted there by COGEMA was well asin the United Kingdom by BNFL. The direct vitrification process was developedin the United States, Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, whereindustrial applications are planned. Direct vitrification uses a refractoryceramic melter containing a molten glass volume into which the processsolution is injected. Raw materials may be mixed with the solution oradded separately.</TEXT></DOC>
