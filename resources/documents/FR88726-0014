It applies to HQ DLA and all DLA fieldactivities. A list of mailing addresses for DLA activities is providedat enclosure 5. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1285.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The public has the right of access to information concerningthe activities of the Federal Government. DLA policy is to conduct itsoperations in an open manner and to provide the public with accurate andtimely information concerning its activities. Individuals complying withthe procedural requirements of this rule shall be provided prompt accessto DLA records which are not exempt from disclosure. DLA activities andpersonnel will comply with the letter and the spirit of the Freedom ofInformation Act, hereafter referred to as ``the FOIA,'' and this rule willensure that procedural requirements do not unnecessarily impede publicaccess. DLA activities will also provide assistance to individuals, asrequired, to help them understand and comply with the requirements of thisrule, and to reduce governmental costs and assessable fees. (b) <T3>Administrative Requirements and Determinations. </T3>A record mustbe in the possession and control of DLA to be subject to the provisionsof this rule. In submitting requests, the requester must provide a reasonabledescription of the record(s) sought; furthermore, the requester must provideeither a declaration of the willingness to pay assessable fees associatedwith filling the request or a justification for the waiver of fees. Determinationsthat requests are deficient in these respects are not denials of access;and, except as provided below, such determinations are not subject to administrativeappeals: (1) DLA activities have no obligation to create or compile a record tosatisfy a FOIA request. They may do so, however, when it would either resultin a more useful response for the requester, or be less burdensome to DLAthan providing the records sought, and the requester does not object. Whenan activity compiles a record to satisfy a request, the fees assessed willnot exceed those which would have been charged for the original request.(2) Records, which originated in or which are based on information obtainedfrom other Federal agencies subject to the FOIA are generally referredto that agency even though the record(s) may be in the possession of DLA.In processing FOIA requests for such records, DLA activities, after coordinatingwith the originating agency, will refer the request with a copy of theresponsive records in its possession, to the agency for direct response.The requester will be notified of the referral. When records and documentsare created specifically for the use of another agency, the agency forwhich the record was created may have an equally valid interest in withholdingthe record as the agency that created the record. An example of such asituation is a request for audit reports prepared by the Defense ContractAudit Agency. These advisory reports are prepared for the use of contractingofficers and their release to the audited contractor should be at the discretionof the contracting officer. FOIA requests will be referred to the appropriatecontracting officer. (3) When the fact of the existence of records itself is classified, DLAactivities will confirm classification with the agency or activity exercisingcontrol over the record(s), and will provide the requester a response whichneither confirms nor denies the existence of the records requested. Therequest will not be referred to the controlling agency.(4) When an activity has no records responsive to a request, the requesterwill be notified promptly. In cases where the request has been misdirectedand the activity is aware of the appropriate FOIA respondent, the activityshall refer the request to the appropriate activity or agency and notifythe requester of the referral.(5) Requesters must provide a description of the record(s) sought withsufficient specificity to permit DLA activities to locate it with a reasonableeffort. DLA activities receiving requests which do not reasonably describethe record sought will advise the requester of this deficiency and providethe requester an opportunity to correct it. Generally, a record is notreasonably described unless the requester provides information permittingan organized, nonrandom search of DLA files and information systems. Suchinformation may specifically describe the record, e.g., document type,title, index citation, subject matter, date, and originator, or the eventswhich led to its creation. In providing descriptions based on events, therequester must provide information which permits DLA activities to inferthe specific record sought. Notwithstanding the above, any descriptionpermitting DLA activities to locate a record with reasonable effort issufficient.(6) Requesters must also provide either an adequate declaration of theirwillingness to pay fees associated with the request or substantiate a claimthat a waiver of assessable fees is in the public interest. (See AppendixA of this regulation regarding the schedule of fees.) A fee declarationis adequate when the requester's statements indicate a willingness to paythe fees equal to, or greater than, those assessable under the scheduleof fees. When provided, statements in requests regarding the willingnessto pay for specific services, such as search, duplication, and review,must encompass those appropriately assessable for the requester categorydescribed in Appendix A of this regulation. DLA activities will notifyrequesters of deficiencies in fee declarations and will provide them opportunitiesto amend initial declarations. Determinations on the adequacy of requesterfee declarations are not subject to appeal unless the DLA activity hasdenied a specific request for the assessment of fees under one of the categoriesestablished in Appendix A of this regulation or has denied a request forthe waiver or reduction of fees in the public interest.(c) <T3>Prompt Response to Requests. </T3>DLA activities will respond promptlyto requesters complying with the procedural requirements of this regulation.A determination on access to records will be made within 10 working daysafter receipt of the request by the activity having possession and controlof the record sought unless an extension is authorized under andSection;1285.8(b)(3) of this rule. Activities with ten or more requests pendingaccess determinations will process the requests in the order of receipt.However, activities are not precluded from completing action on requests,which can be answered promptly, regardless of the order of receipt.(d) <T3>Privacy Act and Other Procedures. </T3>Requests by individuals forrecords about themselves will be processed under the statute or regulation(Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act) cited in the request. If therequest cites both Acts, or neither Act, the request will be processedunder time limitations of the FOIA and the fee provisions of DLAR 5400.21.No record or information will be withheld from an individual under thisregulation which would be available to the individual under the PrivacyAct and DLAR 5400.21.(e) <T3>Exemptions_</T3>(1) <T3>General Provisions. </T3>Records that meet the exemption criteria inandSection; 1285.3(e)(4) may be withheld from public disclosure and neednot be published in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>made available in a library reading room, orprovided in response to an FOIA request.(2) <T3>Public Domain. </T3>Nonexempt records released under the authorityof this regulation are generally considered to be in the public domain.Exempt records released pursuant to this regulation or other statutoryor regulatory authority, however, may be considered to be in the publicdomain only when their release constitutes a waiver of the FOIA exemption.When the release does not constitute such a waiver, such as when a disclosureis made to a properly constituted advisory committee or to a CongressionalCommittee, the released records do not lose their exempt status. Whileauthority may exist to disclose records to individuals in their officialcapacity, the provisions of this regulation apply if the same individualseeks the records in a private or personal capacity.(3) <T3>Jeopardy of Government Interest. </T3>An exempted record, other thanthose being withheld pursuant to exemptions 1, 3, or 6, shall be made availableupon the request of any individual when, in the judgment of the releasingDLA activity or higher authority, release would not jeopardize a Governmentinterest. It is appropriate for DLA activities to use their discretionaryauthority on a case-by-case basis in the release of given records. If aDLA activity determines that a record requested under the FOIA meets theexemption 4 withholding criteria set forth in this regulation, the DLAactivity shall not ordinarily exercise its discretionary power to release,absent circumstances in which a compelling public interest will be servedby release of that record. Further guidance on this issue may be foundat andSection; 1285.3(e)(4)(iv) and andSection; 1285.8(d).(4) <T3>FOIA Exemptions. </T3>The following types of records may be withheldin whole or in part from public disclosure unless otherwise prescribedby law.(i) <T3>Exemption 1.</T3> Those properly and currently classified in the interestof national defense or foreign policy, as specifically authorized underthe criteria established by an Executive Order and implemented by regulations,such as DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program Regulation. Althoughmaterial is not classified at the time of the FOIA request, a classificationreview may be undertaken to determine whether the information should beclassified. If such a review is undertaken, the procedures in DoD 5200.1-R,section 2-204f, apply.  (ii) <T3>Exemption 2.</T3> Those containing or constituting rules, regulations,orders, manuals, directives, and instructions relating to the internalpersonnel rules or practices of a DLA activity if their release to thepublic would substantially hinder the effective performance of a significantfunction of the activity and they do not impose requirements directly onthe general public. Examples include:   (A) Operating rules, guidelines, and manuals for DLA investigators, inspectors,auditors, or examiners that must remain undisclosed in order for the DLAactivity to fulfill a legal requirement.  (B) Personnel and other administrative matters, such as examination questionsand answers used in training courses or in the determination of the qualificationsof candidates for employment, entrance on duty, advancement, or promotion.  (iii) <T3>Exemption 3.</T3> Those concerning matters that a statute specificallyexempts from disclosure by terms that permit no discretion on the issues,or in accordance with criteria established by that statute for withholdingor referring to particular types of matters to be withheld. Examples ofsuch statutes include: (A) Pub. L. No. 86-36 (1959), National Security Agency Information Exemption. (B) Title 35 U.S.C., 181-188. Any records containing information relatingto inventions that are the subject of patent applications on which PatentSecrecy Orders have been issued.  (C) Title 42 U.S.C. 2162, Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data. (D) Title 18 U.S.C. 798, Communication Intelligence.  (E) Title 10 U.S.C. 130, Authority to Withhold From Public Disclosure CertainTechnical Data. (See also DoD Directive 5230.25, Withholding of UnclassifiedTechnical Data From Public Disclosure.)  (F) Title 10 U.S.C. 1102, Confidentiality of Medical Quality Records: QualifiedImmunity Participants.  (iv) <T3>Exemption 4.</T3> Those containing trade secrets or commercial or financialinformation that a DLA activity receives from a person or organization,outside the Government, with the understanding that the information orrecord will be retained on a privileged or confidential basis in accordancewith the customary handling of such records. Records falling within thisexemption must contain trade secrets, or commercial or financial records,the disclosure of which is likely to cause substantial harm to the competitiveposition of the source providing the information; would impair the Government'sability to obtain necessary information in the future; or would impairsome other legitimate Government interest. Examples include records thatcontain: (A) Commercial or financial information received in confidence in connectionwith loans, bids, contracts, or proposals, as well as other informationreceived in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets, inventions,discoveries, or other proprietary data.   (B) Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerningcontract performance, income, profit, losses, and expenditures, if offeredand received in confidence from a contractor or potential contractor. (C) Personal statements given in the course of inspections, investigations,or audits, when such statements are received in confidence from the individualand retained in confidence because they reveal trade secrets or commericalor financial information normally considered confidential or privileged. (D) Financial data provided in confidence by private employers in connectionswith locality wage surveys that are used to fix and adjust pay schedulesapplicable to the prevailing wage rate of employees within DLA.  (E) Scientific and manufacturing processes or developments concerning technicalor scientific data or other information submitted with an application fora research grant, or with a report while research is in progress.  (F) Technical or scientific data developed by a scientific or subcontractorexclusively at private expense, and technical or scientific data developedin part with Federal funds and, in part, at private expense, wherein thecontractor or subcontractor has retained legitimate proprietary interestsin such data in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2320, Rights in Technical Data;10 U.S.C. 2321, Validation of Proprietary Data Restrictions; and DFARS,Subpart 27.4. Technical data developed exclusively with Federal funds maybe withheld under <T3>Exemption</T3> 3 if it meets the criteria of 10 U.S.C. 130, Authorityto Withhold from Public Disclosure Certain Technical Data and DoD Directive5230.25. (See andSection;1285.3(e)(4)(iii).  (v) <T3>Exemption 5.</T3> Except as provided in andSection;1285.3(e)(4)(v)(B)through (E), of this section, internal advice, recommendations, and subjectiveevaluations, as contrasted with factual matters, that are reflected inrecords pertaining to the decisionmaking process of an agency, whetherwithin or among agencies (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(e) or within or amongDLA activities.  (A) <T3>Examples include:  </T3>(<T3>1</T3>) The nonfactual portions of staff papers, to include afteractionreports and situation reports containing staff evaluations, advice, opinions,or suggestions.  (<T3>2</T3>) Advice, suggestions, or evaluations prepared on behalf of DLAby individual consultants or by boards, committees, councils, groups, panels,conferences, commissions, task forces, or other similar groups that areformed for the purpose of obtaining advice and recommendations.  (<T3>3</T3>) Those nonfactual portions of evaluations by DLA personnel ofcontractors and their products.  (<T3>4</T3>) Information of a speculative, tentative, or evaluative natureon such matters as proposed plans to procure, lease, or otherwise acquireand dispose of materials, real estate, facilities or functions, when suchinformation either would provide undue or unfair competitive advantageto private personal interests or would impede legitimate Government functions. (<T3>5</T3>) Trade secret or other confidential research development, orcommercial information owned by the Government, when premature releaseis likely to affect the Government's negotiating position or other commercialinterests.  (<T3>6</T3>) Records that are exchanged among agency personnel and withinand among DLA activities or agencies as part of the preparation for anticipatedadministrative proceeding by an agency or litigation before any Federalor State court, as well as records that qualify for the attorney/clientprivilege.  (<T3>7</T3>) Those portions of official reports of inspection, reports ofthe Inspector General, audits, investigations, or surveys pertaining tosafety, security, or the internal management, administration, or operationof one of more DLA activities, when these records have traditionally beentreated by the courts as privileged against disclosure in litigation. (B) If any such intra or interagency record or reasonably segregable portionof such a record, hypothetically, would be made available routinely throughthe ``discovery process'' in the course of litigation with the agency,i.e., the process by which litigants obtain information from each otherthat is relevant to the issues in a trial or hearing, then it should notbe withheld from the general public even though discovery has not beensought in actual litigation. If, however, the information, hypothetically,would only be made available through the discovery process by special orderof a court based on the particular needs of a litigant, balanced againstagency interests in maintaining its confidentiality, then the record ordocument need not be made available under this rule. (C) Intra or interagency memoranda or letters that are factual, or  thosereasonably segregable portions that are factual, shall be made availableto a requester, unless the factual material is otherwise exempt from release,inextricably intertwined with the exempt information, so fragmented asto be uninformative, or so redundant of information already available tothe requester as to provide no new substantive information.(D) A direction or order from a superior to a subordinate, though containedin an internal communication, generally cannot be withheld from a requesterif it constitutes policy guidance or a decision, as distinguished froma discussion of preliminary matters or a request for information or advicethat would compromise the decisionmaking process.  (E) An internal communication concerning a decision that subsequently hasbeen made a matter of public record must be made available to a requesterwhen the rationale for the decision is expressly adopted or incorporatedby reference in the record containing the decision.(vi) <T3>Exemption 6. </T3>Information in personnel and medical files, as wellas similar personal information in other files, that, if disclosed to therequester, would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.(A) Examples of files containing personal information similar to that containedin personnel and medical files include:(<T3>1</T3>) Those compiled to evaluate or adjudicate the suitability ofcandidates for civilian employment or membership in the Armed Forces, andthe eligibility of individuals (civilian, military, and contractor employees)for either security clearances or for access to particularly sensitiveclassified information.(<T3>2</T3>) Files containing reports, records, and other material pertainingto personnel matters in which administrative action, including disciplinaryaction, may be taken.(B) In determining whether the release of information would result in a``clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,'' consideration shallbe given to the stated or ascertained purpose of the request. When determiningwhether a release is ``clearly unwarranted,'' the public interest in satisfyingthis purpose must be balanced against the sensitivity of the privacy interestbeing threatened. One example of such is lists of names and duty addressesof DLA personnel (civilian and military) assigned to units that are sensitive,routinely deployable, or stationed in foreign territories. Release of suchinformation could aid in the targeting of DoD employees and their familiesby terrorists. This exemption shall not be exercised in an attempt to protectthe privacy of a deceased person; but, it may be used to protect the privacyof the deceased person's family.(C) Individuals' personnel, medical, or similar file may be withheld fromthem or their designated legal representative only to the extent consistentwith DLAR 5400.21.(D) A clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the persons identifiedin a personnel, medical, or similar record, other than the subject of therecord, may constitute a basis for deleting those reasonably segregableportions of that record when providing it to the subject of the record.(vii) <T3>Exemption 7. </T3>Records or information for law enforcement purposes;i.e., civil, criminal, or military law, including the implementation ofExecutive Orders or rules issued pursuant to law.(A) This exemption applies, however, only to the extent that productionof such law enforcement records or information could result in the following:(<T3>1</T3>) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcementproceedings.(<T3>2</T3>) Would deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or to animpartial adjudication.(<T3>3</T3>) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasionof personal privacy of a living person, including surviving family membersof an individual identified in such a record.(<T3>4</T3>) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of aconfidential source, including a source within the DoD, a State, local,or foreign agency or authority, or any private institution which furnishesthe information on a confidential basis.(<T3>5</T3>) Could disclose information furnished from a confidential sourceand obtained by a criminal law enforcement authority in a criminal investigationor by any agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation.(<T3>6</T3>) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcementinvestigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcementinvestigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expectedto risk circumvention of the law.(<T3>7</T3>) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physicalsafety of any individual.(B) Examples include:(<T3>1</T3>) Statements of witnesses and other material developed duringthe course of the investigation and all materials prepared in connectionwith related Government litigation or adjudicative proceedings.(<T3>2</T3>) The identity of firms or individuals being investigated foralleged irregularities involving contracting with DLA when neither an indictmenthas been obtained nor any civil action filed against them by the UnitedStates.(<T3>3</T3>) Information obtained in confidence, expressed or implied inthe coarse of a criminal investigation by a criminal law enforcement agencyor office within a DoD agency or a lawful national security intelligenceinvestigation conducted by an authorized agency or office within a DLAactivity. National security intelligence investigations include backgroundsecurity investigations and those investigations conducted for the purposeof obtaining affirmative or counterintelligence information.(C) The right of individual litigants to investigative records currentlyavailable by law (such as 18 U.S.C. 3500, The Jencks Act), is not diminished.(D) When the subject of an investigative record is the requester of therecord, it may be withheld only as authorized by DLAR 5400.21.(E) Exclusions. Excluded from the above exemption are the following:(<T3>1</T3>) Whenever a request is made which involves access to recordsor information compiled for law enforcement purposes, and the investigationor proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law where thereis reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceedingis unaware of its pendency, and the disclosure of the existence of therecords could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings,the records or information during only such times as that circumstancecontinues, may be treated as not subject to <T3>Exemption 7. </T3>In such situation, the response to the requesterwill state that no records were found.(<T3>2</T3>) Whenever information records maintained by a criminal law enforcementorganization under the informant's name or personal identifier are requestedby a third party using the informant's name or personal identifier, therecords may be treated as not subject to <T3>Exemption 7, </T3>unless the informant's status as an informant hasbeen officially confirmed. It is determined that the records are not subjectto <T3>Exemption 7, </T3>the response to the requester will state that norecords were found.(viii) <T3>Exemption 8. </T3>Those contained in or related to examination, operation,or condition reports prepared by, on behalf, or for the use of any agencyresponsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.(ix) <T3>Exemption 9. </T3>Those containing geological and geophysical informationand data (including maps) concerning wells.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1285.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>As used in this regulation, the following terms and meanings shall be applicable.(a) <T3>Administrative Appeal. </T3>A request by a member of the general public,made under the FOIA, asking the appellate authority to reverse an InitialDenial Authority decision to withhold all or part of a requested record,to deny a request for waiver or reduction of fees, or to impose fees undera standard for individual requester and use categories.(b) <T3>Agency Record.

Such requests should be submitted directly to the appropriateactivities listed in Appendix E of this regulation. If the appropriateactivity is either unknown or cannot be ascertained, and the record islikely to be in the possession and control of DLA, the request may be submittedto HQ DLA, ATTN: DLA-XAM, Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia 22304-6100.(2) In submitting requests, requesters should:(i) Identify each record sought with sufficient detail to permit the locationof the record with a reasonable amount of effort. Information as to wherethe record originated, its subject, date, number, or other identifyingparticulars should be provided whenever possible.(ii) Identify all other Federal agencies subject to the provisions of theFreedom of Information Act to which the request has been sent. This willreduce processing and coordination time between agencies and redundantreferrals.(iii) Provide a statement of their willingness to pay assessible chargesunder the schedule of fees in Appendix A of this rule. A statement mustinclude a specific monetary amount if the assessible fees are likely toexceed $15 or a specific justification for any waiver or reduction of feessought based on public interest in release or disclosure. Requesters shouldalso substantiate any claim for the assessment of fees under a specificfee category as explained in Appendix A of this rule.(3) DLA activities will promptly forward misdirected requests to the properagency or activity through FOIA channels and notify the requester of thereferral. The 10-working-day period allowed for responding to requestswill not begin until the activity having the responsive records receivesa request complying with procedural requirements of this regulation, includingstatements on the payment of fees.(4) The provisions of the FOIA are intended for parties with private interests.Officials seeking documents or information on behalf of foreign governments,other Federal agencies, and state and local agencies are encouraged toemploy official channels. The release of records to individuals under theFOIA is a public release of information. DLA activities will consider FOIArequests from such officials as made in a private, rather than official,capacity and will make disclosure and fee determinations accordingly.(b) <T3>Control System and Time Limits.</T3> (1) Each DLA activity will maintaina control system designed to ensure compliance with the FOIA. The systemshall provide controls to maintain responsiveness in handling requestsmade under the FOIA and methods to assure accurate cost accounting forthe assessment of fees and reporting.(2) On receipt of a properly submitted FOIA request, DLA activities willlocate and assemble responsive records, determine whether they are releasableunder the provisions of this regulation, determine the fees appropriatelycharged, and advise the requester accordingly. Initial determinations oneither the release or denial of records, and notice to requesters, shouldbe provided within 10 working days following receipt of the request bythe activity maintaining the records.(3) In certain cases, DLA activities may exercise an extension to the normal10-working-day period outlined above. Such extensions must be approvedby the FOIA Officer for the activity and may not exceed 10 additional workdays.The requester will be notified of approved extensions within the initial10-working-day period described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and,the requester will be advised of the circumstances necessitating the extensionand the anticipated date of a determination and response to the request.The circumstances where such extensions may be approved include:(i) The record(s) sought are located at places other than the activityprocessing the request, such as Federal Archives and Records Center orgeographically separated elements of the activity.(ii) The request requires the collection and review of a substantial numberof records.(iii) The disclosure determination requires consultation with another activityor agency with a substantial interest.(4) As an alternative to the extensions described above, DLA activitiesmay seek informal agreements with requesters for extensions in unusualcircumstances when time limits become an issue in the activity's responseto the request. (c) <T3>Initial Disclosure Determinations. </T3>(1) Initial determinationsto make records available may be made by any official designated by theactivity. When a decision is made to release records in response to a FOIArequest, the records will be made available promptly to the requester.When the request is for the examination of releasable records, the officialwill advise the requester when and where he may appear for the purpose.Examinations will be held during normal business hours except in unusualcircumstances. (2) DLA officials with the authority to release information under thisregulation should consult public affairs officers when releasing recordson matters considered newsworthy or when releasing records to media representatives.(3) There are seven reasons for not providing a record in response to aFOIA request: (i) The information or item requested is not a record within the meaningof the FOIA and this regulation. (ii) The record has not been described with sufficient specificity to enableDLA to locate it by conducting a reasonable search. (iii) The requester has failed to comply with procedural requirements,including agreements to pay assessable fees, imposed by this regulation.(iv) DLA determines through knowledge of its files and reasonable searchesthat it neither controls nor otherwise processes the requested record orthat the requested record does not exist. (v) The request is withdrawn by the requester. (vi) The request is transferred to another activity or agency. (vii) The request is denied in accordance with the provisions of this regulation.(4) Determinations to withhold either records or information within recordsmay be made only by the Heads of DLA PLFAs or the Heads of HQ DLA PSEs.This authority may not be redelegated. (d) <T3>Consultation on Confidential Commercial Information. </T3>(1) Whena request is received for a record containing information provided by asource outside the Federal Government, which is subject to disclosure and,if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitiveharm to the source, the activity will notify the source of the pendingdisclosure determination and provide the source or its designee with anopportunity to object to the disclosure of any specified portion of theinformation and to state all grounds on which disclosure is opposed. Noticeand consultation with the source of such information is not required, however,when the activity determines: (i) The information should not be disclosed. (ii) The information or record has been published or officially made availableto the public. (iii) Disclosure of the information is required by a law other than theFOIA. (2) In consulting sources under this procedure, DLA activities shall providesources a reasonable period of time to present objections to disclosure.The requester shall be provided a concurrent notification on the activity'suse of this consultation procedure with an estimated date for the activity'sdisclosure determination. (3) DLA activities shall give careful consideration to all specified groundsfor nondisclosure presented by the source. Initial denial authorities willmake disclosure determinations. When a substantial issue has been raised,the activity may seek additional information from the source of the informationand afford the source and requester reasonable opportunities to presenttheir arguments on the legal and substantive issues involved prior to makingan agency determination. (i) When the initial denial authority determines the information appropriatelywithheld, the activity shall issue a denial to the requester under theprocedures outlined in andSection;1285.8(c) and shall provide a copy of thedetermination to the source. (ii) In those instances when the source has objected to disclosure, andthe initial denial authority determines the information will be disclosed,the activity shall provide the source with a written statement which brieflyexplains the reasons for disclosure and a scheduled date for release torequester. The statement shall be provided to the source by certified mailwith return receipt reasonably prior to the specified disclosure date.A copy of this statement will also be provided to the requester. When thesource advises it will seek a restraining order or take court action toprevent release of the record or information, the activity will notifythe requester of the proposed action. (4) Likewise, whenever a DLA activity is informed that a FOIA requesterhas brought suit in court seeking to compel disclosure of Confidentialcommercial information, the source will be notified promptly of the suit.(e) <T3>Denials. </T3>(1) A record in the possession and control of DLA maybe withheld only when the record falls within one or more of the nine categoriesof records exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA, and the useof discretionary authority to release the record is determined to be unwarranted.Staff consultation and coordination with the servicing Office of Counselare mandatory for all denials. (2) Although exempt portions of records may be denied, nonexempt portionsmust be released to the requester when the meaning of these portions isnot distorted by the deletion of denied portions and when it reasonablycan be assumed that a skillful and knowledgeable person could not reconstructthe excised information. When a record is denied in whole based on distortionor reconstruction potential, the response advising the requester of thedetermination will specifically state that it is not possible to reasonablysegregate meaningful portions for release. (3) When a request for a record is denied in whole or in part, the Headof the PLFA or the Head of the PSE will inform the requester in writingof the specific exemption(s) on which the denial is based and explain thedetermination in sufficient detail to permit the requester to make a decisionconcerning appeal. The determination will also inform the requester ofhis/her rights of appeal to the Director, DLA. Such appeals must be madewithin 60 calendar days of the determination, contain the reasons for therequester's disagreement with the determination, and be addressed to HQDLA (ATTN: DLA-G), Cameron Station, Alexandria, VA 22304-6100. (i) When the initial denial is based on security classification, the explanationwill include a summary of the applicable criteria for classification, aswell as an explanation, to the extent reasonably feasible, of how the criteriaapply to the particular records in question. (See DLAR 5200.12, DLA InformationSecurity Program, setting forth the criteria or rationale for classification.)The determination will also advise the requester of the availability ofdeclassification review of records more than 10 years old under DoD 5200.1-R,when appropriate. (ii) DLA activities will provide an informational copy of each denial toDLA-XAM. No supporting documents such as requests or withheld documentsneed be forwarded. (f) <T3>Appeals. </T3>(1) Requesters denied access to records under the provisionsof subparagraph E, may appeal such determinations to the Director, DLA.However, a ``no record'' finding may not be appealed, although a requestermay ask the agency to search other files or provide more detailed identificationto facilitate another search of the files. The procedures in this sectionconcern appeals regarding disclosure matters and the appropriate use ofexemption procedures for appeals of fee determinations are outlined inAppendix A of this rule. Records which are denied should be retained duringthe time submitted for appeal. (2) The requester shall be advised that an appeal should be filed so thatit reaches the appellate authority within 60 calender days after the dateof the initial denial letter. At the conclusion of this period, the casemay be considered closed; however, such closure does not preclude the requesterfrom filing litigation. In cases where the requester has been provideda series of determinations for a single request, the time for appeal willbegin on the date of the last determination of the series. When filingan appeal, a copy of the letter denying the initial request should be included.(3) Final determinations normally shall be made within 20 working daysof receipt of an appropriately submitted appeal. When additional time isrequired to respond to the appeal for the reasons outlined in andSection;1285.8(b)(3), the final determination may be delayed for the number ofworking days (not to exceed 10 days) not used as additional time for respondingto the initial request. DLA-G will advise the requester of the circumstancesin the use of such extensions and the anticipated date of a substantiveresponse. Requesters shall be advised that, if the delay exceeds the statutoryextension provision or is for reasons other than the unusual circumstancesidentified in andSection; 1285.8(b)(3), they may consider their administrativeremedies exhausted. They may, however, without prejudicing their rightof judicial remedy, await a substantive response. DLA shall continue toprocess the case expeditiously, whether or not the requester seeks a courtorder for release of the records, but a copy of any response provided subsequentto filing a complaint shall be forwarded to the Department of Justice.(4) When the Director, DLA, makes a determination to release all or a portionof the records sought on appeal, the records shall be made available promptlyto the requester after compliance with procedural requirements, such aspayment of fees. A final denial to provide records sought will be madein writing, explain the exemptions invoked, advise that the material beingdenied does not contain meaningful portions that are reasonably segregable,and advise the requester of the right of judicial review. When the finaldenial is based in whole or in part on a security classification, the explanationwill include a determination that the record meets the criteria and rationaleof the governing Executive Order, that the determination is based on declassificationreview, and explain how the review confirmed the validity of continuingclassification. (g) <T3>Privileged Release. </T3>(1) Subject to the limitations in DoD 5200.1-Rand DLAR 5400.21, records exempt from mandatory disclosure under this regulation,may be authenticated and released to officials requesting them on behalfof local, state, and Federal Government authorities (including executive,administrative, legislative, and judicial authorities) as follows: (i) To Congress, in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.4, Provision ofinformation to Congress, and DLAR 5400.12. (ii) To the Federal courts as ordered by the officers of the court forthe administration of justice. (iii) To executive and administrative agencies of the Federal Governmentand state and local officials as determined by the Director, DLA, the Headsof HQ DLA PSEs, Commanders of PLFAs, and other authorized officials. (2) Technical information and data exempt from mandatory disclosure mayalso be disseminated or released to qualified contractors and registeredusers under the specific limitations and requirements. (See DoD Instruction5200.21, Dissemination of DoD Technical Information, and DoD Directive5230.25.) (3) Privileged release is not considered public release for the purposesof FOIA and this regulation. DLA activities will inform parties receivingrecords under this section that such records are exempt from public releaseunder the FOIA and are privileged. They will also provide special handlinginstructions, where appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1285.9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Forms and Reports. </ITAG>Each PLFA shall prepare statistics and accumulate paperwork for the precedingcalender year on those items prescribed for the annual FOIA Report (AppendixD), and submit this material to DLA-XAM on or before 15 January each year.This reporting requirement is assigned RCS DD-PA(A)1365.<ITAG tagnum="52">Appendix A_Fee Schedule</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">(a) General Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(1) Application</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The fees described in this enclosure apply to FOIA requests andother inquiries which solicit DLA records, including those containing technicaldata. They reflect direct costs in processing of public requests underthe FOIA, and direct and indirect costs in processing requests for technicaldata. The fees identified are subject to limitations on the nature of assessablefees based on the category of the requester, statutory and automatic waiversbased on the category determination and cost of routine collection, andeither the waiver or reduction of fees when disclosure serves the publicinterest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The specific provisions on assessable fees, restrictions, andwaivers are provided in outline from below for easy reference. The chartidentifies four classes of requesters and the types of charges which maybe assessed each class.

If this processing was equal to, or less than, the costfor billing the requester and processing the fee collected ($15 or less),no charges would result.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(2) Fee Assessment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) DLA activities will evaluate each request to determine the requestercategory and adequacy of any fee declaration. An adequate declaration requiresa willingness by the requester to pay fees in an amount equal to, or greaterthan, the assessable charges for the request. When provided, statementsin requests regarding the willingness to pay for specific services, suchas search, duplication, and review, must encompass those appropriatelyassessable for the requester category described above. DLA activities willprovide requesters an opportunity to amend inadequate fee declarationsand provide estimates of prospective charges when required. When a requesterfails to provide an adequate declaration within 30 days after notificationof a deficiency, the request for information will be considered withdrawn.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) A requester's claims for assessment of fees under a specificcategory will be carefully considered. A DLA activity may require a requesterto substantiate a claim for assessment under a claimed category. In theabsence of requester claims, an activity will determine the category intowhich a requester falls, basing its determination on all available informationand evidence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) When an activity disagrees with a requester claim for fee assessmentunder a specific category, the initial denial authority for the activityconcerned will provide a written determination advising the requester:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) The category into which the requester was placed for the assessmentof fees and on the rationale for this determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) That additional information to justify the category claimed shouldbe forwarded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) Absent further information, the activity will render, within 30calendar days, a final category determination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) That the determination may be appealed to the Staff Director,Administration, HQ DLA, within 60 calendar days of the date of the determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(E) Notwithstanding any appeal, a search for responsive records willnot be initiated until the requester indicates a willingness to pay assessablefees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) When an activity estimates or determines that allowable chargesare likely to exceed $250, the activity may require a provisional paymentin an amount up to the full estimated charges. Provisional payments maynot be required for requests with estimated fees of $250 or less.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged ina timely fashion (i.e., within 30 calendar days from the date of billing),activities may require the requester to pay the full amount due from previousrequests, plus any applicable interest, or demonstrate satisfaction ofthe debt and to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount ofestimated fees, before the activity begins to process a new or pendingrequest from the requester.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(vi) The administrative time limits for response on access will beginonly after the activity has received from the requester an adequate declarationon a willingness to pay fees and satisfaction of outstanding debts forprior requests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(3) Aggregating Requests</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, eachseeking portions of a document or documents, solely to avoid payment offees. When an activity reasonably believes that a requester is attemptingto break a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evadingthe assessment of fees, the activity may aggregate such requests and chargeaccordingly. One element to be considered in such situation is the timeperiod in which the requests occur. For example, it would be reasonableto presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day periodhad been made to avoid fees. For requests made over a longer period, sucha presumption becomes harder to sustain. In no case may activities aggregatemultiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(4) Fee Waivers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Documents will be furnished without charge, or at a charge reducedbelow fees assessed to the categories of requesters, when the activitydetermines that a waiver or reduction of fees is in the public interestbecause furnishing the information is likely to contribute significantlyto public understanding of the operations or activities of DLA and is notprimarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In applying thiswaiver, DLA activities should consider the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Disclosure of the information is in the public interest becauseit is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of theoperations or activities of the Government. Factors to consider include: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>1</T3>) <T3>The subject of the request: </T3>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>i</T3>) Activities should analyze whether the subject matter of therequest involves issues which will significantly contribute to the publicunderstanding of the operations or activities of DLA. Requests for recordsin the possession of DLA which were originated by non-Government organizationsand are sought for their intrinsic content, rather than information value,will likely not contribute to public understanding of the operations oractivities of DLA. An example of such records might be press clippings,magazine articles, or records forwarding a particular opinion or concernfrom a member of the public regarding a DLA activity.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>ii</T3>) Similarly, disclosures or records of considerable age maynot bear directly on the current activities of DLA; however, the age ofa particular record shall not be the sole criteria for denying relativesignificance under this factor. It is possible to envision an informativeissue concerning the current activities of DLA, based upon historical documentation.Requests of this nature must be closely reviewed in light of the requester'sstated purpose for desiring the records and the potential for public understandingof the operation and activities of DLA.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>2</T3>) <T3>The informative value of the materials requested to be disclosed. </T3>Thisfactor requires a close analysis of the substantive contents of a record,or portion of the record, to determine whether disclosure is meaningful,and will inform the public on the operations or activities of DLA. Whilethe subject of a request may contain information which concerns operationsor activities of DLA, it may not always hold great potential for contributingto a meaningful understanding of these operations or activities. An exampleof such would be a heavily redacted record, the balance of which may containonly random words, fragmented sentences, or paragraph headings. Whetherrelease of such a record in this situation will contribute to the publicunderstanding of the operations or activities of DLA must be weighed againstthe arguments offered by the requester. Another example is informationalready known to be in the public domain. Disclosure of duplicative, ornearly identical information already existing in the public domain, mayadd no meaningful new information concerning the operations and activitiesof DLA.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>3</T3>) <T3>The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the generalpublic likely to result from disclosure. </T3>The key element in determiningthe applicability of this factor is whether disclosure will inform, orhave the potential to inform the public, rather than simply the individualrequester or small segment of interested persons. The identity of the requesteris essential in this situation in order to evaluate whether the requesterhas the capability and intention to disseminate the information to thepublic. Mere assertions of plans to author a book, research a particularsubject, research doctoral dissertation work, or indigency are insufficientwithout demonstrating the capacity to further disclose the informationin a manner which will be informative to the general public. Requestersshould be asked to describe their qualifications, the nature of their research,the purpose of the requested information, and their intended means of disseminationto the public.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>4</T3>) <T3>The significance of the contribution to public understanding: </T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>i</T3>) In applying this factor, activities must differentiate therelative significance or impact of the disclosure against the current levelof public knowledge or understanding which exists prior to the disclosure.In other words: Will disclosure on a current subject of wide public interestbe unique in contributing previously unknown facts, thereby enhancing publicknowledge, or will it basically duplicate what is already known by thegeneral public? A decision regarding significance requires objective judgement,rather than subjective determination, and must be applied carefully todetermine whether disclosure will likely lead to a significant public understandingof the issue. Activities shall not make value judgements as to whetherthe information is important enough to be made public.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>ii</T3>) Disclosure of the information ``is not primarily in the commercialinterest of the requester.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>A</T3>) <T3>The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest.</T3>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>1</T3>) If the request is determined to be of a commercial interest,activities should address the magnitude of that interest to determine ifthe requester's commercial interest is primary, as opposed to any secondarypersonal or noncommercial interest. In addition to profit-making organizations,individual persons or other organizations may have a commercial interestin obtaining certain records.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>2</T3>) Where it is difficult to determine whether the request is ofa commercial nature, activities may draw inference from the requester'sidentity and circumstances of the request. Activities are remained thatin order to apply the commercial standards of the FOIA, the requester'scommercial benefit must clearly override any personal or nonprofit interest. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(<T3>B</T3>) <T3>The primary interest in disclosure. </T3>Once a requester's commercialinterest has been determined, activities should then determine if the disclosurewould be primarily in that interest. This requires a balancing test betweenthe commercial interest of the request against any public benefit to bederived as a result of that disclosure. Where the public interest is servedabove and beyond that of the requester's commercial interest, a waiveror reduction of fees would be appropriate. Conversely, even if a significantpublic interest exists, and the relative commercial interest of the requesteris determined to be greater than the public interest, then a waiver orreduction of fees would be inappropriate. As examples, news media organizationshave a commercial interest as business organizations; however, their inherentrole of disseminating news to the general public can ordinarily be presumedto be of a primary interest. Therefore, any commercial interest becomessecondary to the primary interest in serving the public. Similarly, scholarswriting books or engaged in other forms of academic research may recognizea commercial benefit, either directly or indirectly (through the institutionthey represent); however, such pursuits normally are undertaken primarilyfor educational purposes, and the application of a fee charge would beinappropriate. Conversely, data brokers or others who merely compile Governmentinformation for marketing can normally be presumed to have an interestprimarily of a commercial nature.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) In addition, the following additional circumstances describesituations where waiver or reduction of fees are most likely to be warranted: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) A record is voluntarily created to preclude an otherwise burdensomeeffort to provide voluminous amounts of available records, including additionalinformation not requested.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) A previous denial of access to records is reversed in total, orin part, and the assessable costs do not exceed $30. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Activities are reminded that the above factors and examplesare not all inclusive. Each fee decision must be considered on a case-by-casebasis and upon the merits of the information provided in each request.When the element of whether to charge or waive the fee cannot be clearlyresolved, activities should rule in favor of the requester.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">(b) Collection of Fees and Fee Rates</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(1) Collection of Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) No fee may be charged by DLA activities if the costs of processingthe request are equal to or less than $15.

The Debt Collection Act of 1982. Pub. L. 97-365 (1982) providesfor a minimum annual rate of interest to be charged on overdue debts owedthe Federal Government. Finance Officers may levy this interest penaltyfor any fees that remain outstanding 30 calendar days from the date ofbilling (the first demand notice) to the requester on the amount owed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Billing/responses to requests should take the form of demand noticesand ask that payments be sent directly to Finance and Accounting Offices.The requirement can be accommodated by adding standard language or paragraphto responses such as: ``Freedom of Information Act processing fees in theamount of $___ have been assessed for this request. This fee is currentlydue and payable. Please send a copy of this letter with a check or moneyorder payable to the Defense Logistics Agency (provide the mailing addressof appropriate Finance and Accounting Office). If not received within 30days after this billing, interest will accrue to the amount until receiptof payment in full at the rates set by the Secretary of the Treasury asprovided under the Debt Collection Act of 1982.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) All fees collected for services provided under the FOIA, otherthan fees collected in providing technical data, will be credited to miscellaneousreceipts of the Treasury. Fees collected for providing technical data willbe treated as an appropriations refund and credited to the Operations andMaintenance (Oandamp;M) or Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDTandamp;E)funds of the activity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) DLA activities should provide the requester the original and onecopy of the response, and also provide a copy to the appropriate financeand accounting office with a notation regarding the proper crediting ofthe funds. To the extent required, finance and accounting officers shouldpursue collections under DLAM 7000.1, Accounting and Finance Manual, andadvise FOIA officers on instances where the requester has failed to payand subsequent requester settlements for the purposes of suspending requesterprivileges and reporting. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) In those instances where payments are required as a preconditionof processing the request (those with estimated charges exceeding $250),activities should have such payments sent to the Freedom of InformationAct Officer for subsequent surrender to finance officers under DD Form1131, Cash Collection Voucher, cash collection procedures.

No other material shall be considered or marked (FOUO),and a FOUO designation is not authorized for use as a form of classificationto protect national security interests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Prior FOUO Application.</T3> The prior application of FOUO markingsis not a conclusive basis for withholding a record that is requested underthe FOIA. When such a record is requested, the information in it shallbe evaluated to determine whether, under current circumstances, FOIA exemptionsapply. Even if exemptions apply, information may nonetheless be releasedwhen it is determined that no governmental interest will be jeopardizedby its release.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Historical Papers.</T3> Records such as notes, working papers, anddrafts retained as historical evidence of DLA activity actions enjoy nospecial status apart from the exemptions under the FOIA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>Time to Mark Records.</T3> The marking of records at the time of theircreation provides notice of FOUO content and facilitates review when arecord is requested under the FOIA.

Records thus transmitted shall bemarked ``For Official Use Only''; and, the recipient shall be advised thatthe information has been exempted from public disclosure, pursuant to theFOIA, and that special handling instructions do or do not apply.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Release of FOUO information to Members of Congress is governedby DLAR 5400.12. Release to the General Accounting Office (GAO) is governedby DoD Directive 7650.1, General Accounting Office Access to Records. Recordsreleased to the Congress or GAO should be reviewed to determine whetherthe information warrants FOUO status. If not, prior FOUO markings shallbe removed or effaced. If withholding criteria are met, the records shallbe marked FOUO and the recipient provided an explanation for such exemptionand marking. Alternatively, the recipient may be requested, without markingthe record, to protect against its public disclosure for reasons that areexplained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Transporting FOUO Information.</T3> Records containing FOUO informationshall be transported in a manner that precludes disclosure of the contents.When not commingled with classified information, FOUO information may besent via first-class mail or parcel post. Bulky shipments, such as distributionsof FOUO regulations or testing materials that otherwise qualify under postalregulations, may be sent by fourth-class mail.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Electronically Transmitted Messages.</T3> Each part of electricallytransmitted messages containing FOUO information shall be marked appropriately.Unclassified messages containing FOUO information shall contain the abbreviation``FOUO'' before the beginning of the text.

Filing such material withother unclassified records in unlocked files or desks, etc., is adequatewhen normal U.S. Government or Government-contractor internal buildingsecurity is provided during nonduty hours. When such internal securitycontrol is not exercised, locked buildings or rooms normally provide adequateafter-hours protection. If such protection is not considered adequate,FOUO material shall be stored in locked receptacles such as file cabinets,desks, or bookcases. FOUO records that are subject to the provisions ofPub.

When local circumstances or experienceindicate that this destruction method is not sufficiently protective ofFOUO information, local authorities may direct other methods but must givedue consideration to the additional expense balanced against the degreeof sensitivity of the type of FOUO information contained in the records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) 2. Record copies of FOUO documents shall be disposed of in accordancewith the disposal standards established under 44 U.S.C., CH 33, Disposalof Records, as implemented by DLAM 5015.1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Unauthorized Disclosure. </T3>The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO recordsdoes not constitute an unauthorized disclosure of DLA information classifiedfor security purposes. Appropriate administrative action shall be taken,however, to fix responsibility for unauthorized disclosure whenever feasible,and appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against those responsible.Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information that is protected by the PrivacyAct may also result in criminal sanctions against responsible persons.The DLA activity that originated the FOUO information shall be informedof its unauthorized disclosure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Appendix C_Judicial Actions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">(a) </ITAG><T3>General Provisions </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) This section states current legal and procedural rules for theconvenience of the reader.
