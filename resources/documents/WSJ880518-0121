My letter was about freedom, not the tobacco industry.    Mr. Lidz says, &quot;There can be no dilution of the principles of responsibility by which citizens are able to rely upon one another.&quot; This sounds like something a Soviet judge would say just before he sentences you to 20 years in the gulag for &quot;irresponsible&quot; acts against the state.    In a free society, there are no state-dictated &quot;principles of responsibility,&quot; only individuals who accept responsibility to each other based on their individual value judgments. A free society must tolerate a wide variety of value judgments and therefore a wide range of what individuals accept as their responsibility to society.    Individual responsibility is the entire basis of our society and its freely elected leaders. Those who would dictate to us what our responsibilities are to each other are asking us to accept their value judgments of society. That is not freedom.    Mr. Lidz's suggestion that the tobacco industry is irresponsible for marketing a legal product is ludicrous. Are egg producers &quot;irresponsible&quot; for selling cholesterol-laden eggs? Heart disease kills more people than cancer. Should Henry Ford be liable for all the automobile deaths caused by Model Ts without seatbelts? Where does Mr. Lidz's failure to accept responsibility for his own fate lead us? To a nation of irresponsible individuals who wish only to accept the responsibilities of life that suit them today.
