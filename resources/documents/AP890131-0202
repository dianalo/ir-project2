Baker III for the key post of assistnatsecretary for inter-American affairs, congressional sources saidTuesday.   A Democratic Senate source, who spoke only on condition ofanonymity, said Aronson was picked because he is a moderate who canappeal to both Democrats and Republicans on divisive CentralAmerican policies, particularly Nicaragua.   But the appointment may provoke controversy among somecongressional liberals because Aronson once helped lobby Congress onbehalf of a military aid package for the Contra rebels fightingNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   ``I think it's more than just a trial balloon,'' said Sen. NancyKassebaum, R-Kan., a member of the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee.   Aronson emerged from a group that included at least two othercontenders to succeed Elliott Abrams in the job. Abrams became thelightning rod for the Reagan admistration's Nicaragua policy, thelongest-running dispute with Congress of Reagan's presidency.   Baker had reportedly also been considering Robert C. Helander, aNew York attorney, and Deane R. Hinton, U.S. ambassador to CostaRica, but both were objectionable to conservatives who saw them asnot sufficiently devoted to the Contras.   Aronson had met in recent days with both House Speaker JimWright, D-Texas, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, and paid courtesy calls to other congressional leaders onTuesday.   Aronson, a former speechwriter for Walter F. Mondale, now is amember of a Council on Foreign Relations study group on CentralAmerica.   When the Reagan administration was trying to sell a Contra aidpackage on Capitol Hill in 1986, Aronson joined a group of otherliberals to help and wrote a speech for Reagan that admitted Contrahuman rights violations and sought to condition military aid for therebels on improving their human rights record.   ``I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to worktogether,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who visited withAronson and said the appointee spoke in support of the regionalpeace plan drawn up by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.</TEXT></DOC>
