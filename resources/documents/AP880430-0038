The legal issue was referred Friday to the District of ColumbiaCourt of Appeals in a case involving Thomas K. Delahanty, a formerDistrict of Columbia policeman, one of three people wounded bypresidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. in the 1981 shooting.Delahanty had tried to sue the gun manufacturer.   The action by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washingtonraises the possibility that Delahanty and former White House pressSecretary James Brady may revive lawsuits against RoehmGesellschaft, the West German manufacturer of the .22-caliberpistol used by Hinckley.   The federal court sought the D.C. court's view because federalcourts must apply the laws of the states in which they are locatedto civil suits.   The court noted that Maryland law should be consulted since theDistrict of Columbia was carved out of Maryland when the nation'scapital was formed.   A 1985 ruling by Maryland's highest court made gun makers andsellers liable for injuries and death caused by the criminal use ofso-called Saturday Night Specials.   The federal court's requst _ an advisory opinion _ is merely asuggestion and does not require a ruling by the D.C. court.   Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel of the NationalRifle Association, said of Friday's advisory opinion, ``It'sobviously disappointing that this court didn't simply say thistheory is so outlandish that we're not going to pay any attentionto it.''   The advisory opinion came a year after the same appellate courtupheld the dismissal of Brady's suit against Roehm and its U.S.subsidiary, R.G. Industries.   In that ruling, the court held Brady did not raise a validnegligence claim because gun manufacturers were not obligated ``toprevent criminals from using their products.''</TEXT></DOC>
