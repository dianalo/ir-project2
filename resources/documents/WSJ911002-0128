First City also said it will consider the sale, merger orrecapitalization of First City Trust Co., its main operatingunit.</LP><TEXT>   Under the plan, First City's credtiors would swap 305million Canadian dollars (US$269.6 million) of debt for C$100million of Harrowston notes and 80% of Harrowston's commonshares.   The Belzbergs would receive 0.8 of a Harrowston commonshare for each First City share, giving them a 15% stake.Minority shareholders would receive Harrowston common shareson a 1-for-1 basis, giving them about a 5% stake.   Under a previous proposal, the Belzberg interest in FirstCity would have fallen to about 24% with creditors holding70%. First City said it amended the proposal followingdiscussions with some of its creditors. First City has aboutC$1.4 billion of debt, much of it tied to real estatedevelopment projects.   The name change to Harrowston is intended to help thecompany shed its image as a corporate raider. First City'sreputation was made during the arbitrage and takeover days ofthe 1980s. The company shut down its securities operationslast year after a string of losses.   First City Trust is 99% held by First City Trustco Inc.,which in turn is 90% held by First City Financial. First CityTrustco, with assets of C$3.87 billion, had a loss of C$121.5million, or C$4.61 a share, in the first six months of theyear.   On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, First CityFinancial closed at 55 Canadian cents, unchanged, and FirstCity Trustco at 60 Canadian cents, down 10 cents.   Creditors and shareholders will meet on Nov. 7 and Nov.11, respectively, to vote on the restructuring proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
