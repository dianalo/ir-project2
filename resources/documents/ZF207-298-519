 Modler is $4,000 a copy and is a command-driven program forprofessionals in the field; with it the user can solve models with as many as1,000 equations.andM;Dataview is $650 and has the same graphics and data-management capabilities,but cannot do modeling.andP;  Alphametrics' newest offering, PowerStation, is $895and is a menu-driven version of Dataview.andP;  Several options are available forthe programs; one is a $750 desktop publishing add-in module that can insertgraphs and tables directly into Ventura Publisher or PageMaker for theprinting of professional-looking reports.andM;The PowerStation menus were actually built with XML, an applications languageincluded with all of the products.andP;  Knowledgeable purchasers can programtheir own data-entry screens using XML, including lookup tables, ranges, andmost other error-trapping schemes.andM;The statistical power of the Alphametrics line is impressive and includessuch capabilities as first- and second-order autoregresssive corrections,polynomial distributed lags up to the fifth order, and 35 embedded datatransformations for direct use.andM;Alphametrics Corp. is at 11 East Princeton Road, Bala Cynwyd, Pa.andP;  19004,(215) 664-6480.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We're using Dataview with a custom application written in the XMLlanguage,'' explained Douglas Handler, associate economist with Dun andBradstreet in New York.andP;  ''We have a proprietary database with information onbusiness starts in over 1,000 industries throughout the country.andP;  We getabout 200 requests a month for information from that database.andP;  We used tohave to write a separate little program every time we needed to extract asubset of data either from our mainframe or our LAN.andP;  Now, using XML, we havea completely menu-driven front-end to Dataview that any clerk can use toselect the proper information, run the statistical analysis ordered, andprint a report with tables or graphs.andM;''We really like the system.andP;  It's almost impossible for the operator to makea mistake.andP;  There's even a plain-English explanation of econometric terms onthe menu [that] appears at the bottom of each screen.''andM;Leo de Bever, chief economist for Crown Life Insurance in Toronto, said, ''Weuse both Modler and Dataview, and we program menu-driven entry screens forboth packages in the XML language.andP;  It does require some knowledge ofprogramming.andP;  XML is basically a mainframe-type macro language, and it's verypowerful.andM;''For data entry, we use all of the normal precautions--ranges, lookuptables, default values, conditionals, cursor skips.andP;  The language lets us dothem all  easily.andM;''Alphametrics is very good with technical support.andP;  If you don't know how todo something or you want to do something the program won't allow, they willusually find a way to help you.andP;  Often they end up adding a new feature tothe product to accommodate the customer.''andM;RS/1andM;BBN Software Products Corp.andM;The specialties of RS/1 are quality control and manufacturing processes; but,of course, its statistical functions can be used for general purposes aswell.andP;  These include linear, polynomial, multiple stepwise and nonlinearregression; many goodness-of-fit options; one- and two-way ANOVA and analysisof covariance; one- and two-tailed t-tests, and several others.andP;  Matrices andvectors are supported, and data for analysis can be accessed from multipletables.andP;  Mainframe and mini versions are also available.andM;The program is operated strictly through commands rather than menus.andO;Excellent graphs can be generated to accompany the procedures.andM;A programming language called RPL supports several forms of data-entrycustomization.andP;  For example, the GetResponse query function lets a typistselect from several responses for a field.andP;  Almost any error-trapping routinecan be employed, since RS/1 has a facility that lets users define newcommands for their own purposes.andP;  All this power, of course, depends upon theavailability of someone with programming experience.andM;BBN Software Products Corp. is at 10 Fawcett St., Cambridge, Mass.andP;  02238,(617) 873-8108.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We collect and analyze process control data,'' explained Marjorie Smith,senior engineer at Storage Technology Corp. in Louisville, Colo.andP;  ''Wemanufacture drives and printers for mainframes and minis to very closetolerances, and precise control is imperative.andM;''We use the RS/1 RPL language to program individual PC workstations so thatthe operator has an attractive menu display to work with, can enter data withhelpful prompts and error-trapping without any knowledge of the softwareprogram, and then automatically sees an updated analysis chart incorporatingthe results.andM;''We spent about three months designing these applications, but it was wellworth it.andP;  We found the RPL language very powerful and friendly.''andM;Doug Sheldon is a senior process development engineer at Ramtron Inc., inColorado Springs, Colo., where ferroelectric integrated circuits aremanufactured.andP;  He explained, ''We download data on tests of silicon wafersfrom an HP 8101, and sort and clean the data with RS/1.andP;  Then we run linearregression analysis and other procedures and draw probability plots.andP;  We alsodo hand entry of research data, but we like to do that in Symphony and thentransfer it; it's faster.andP;  We're happy with RS/1, but an icon-driveninterface would be nice some day to cut down on the amount of typing.''andM;Manufacturing is the principal activity at Nashua Corp. of, Santa Clara,Calif., too, where computer disks are produced.andP;  According to Ian Freeman,manager, head disk interference evaluation, ''We use RS/1 for quality controland analysis.andP;  Much of the data is generated automatically in themanufacturing operations, but we use the RPL language to set up validationroutines for the ASCII files imported.andP;  We have three Ph.D.s in thedepartment, but everybody finds RS/1 easy to use.''andM;ProdasandM;Conceptual Software Inc.andM;About six years ago, when the SAS statistical system wasn't available forpersonal computers, Prodas was introduced and brought similar capabilities toPCs, with the same command structure.andP;  Through the years it has followed SASin development, expansion and features.andP;  Unlike SAS, its modules are sold fora one-time fee instead of an annual licensing arrangement.andM;A standalone statistics package is $530.andP;  The database-management system($720), plus statistics ($420 additional if purchased with the DBMS), plusgraphics (at $365) totals $1,505.andM;The program is written in C and executes faster than many competitiveprograms.andP;  However, it still lacks some statistical procedures, includingtime-series analysis and nonlinear, orthogonal, and polynomial regressioncapabilities.andM;Prodas has a programming language that permits the construction of detaileddata-entry validation routines.andM;Conceptual Software Inc. is at P.O.andP;  Box 56627, Houston, Texas 77256, (713)667-4222.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We use the Prodas language to couple the program to a voice-actuateddata-entry system,'' said Skip Newton, senior scientist at KinneticLaboratories, in Carlsbad, Calif., a marine ecological consulting firm.andM;In an unusual application, they've integrated the IntroVoice V program fromThe Voice Connection of Irvine, Calif., with error-trapping routinesprogrammed into Prodas software.andM;Newton described the process: ''The goal is to identify animal species --sand types, rocks, etc.andP;  -- found in the ocean at depths often 1,000 feetbelow the surface and captured on 70 mm still plates.andP;  These plates areprojected onto a screen, and scientists identify objects located at 100points on a grid superimposed on the photographs.andM;''The scientist speaks the name of an object.andP;  IntroVoice V then translatesthe words into text that Prodas can understand.andP;  Prodas searches its databaseand assigns a matching numeric code to the name.andP;  The name then appears on acomputer screen where the scientist verifies that it is the name that wasspoken.andP;  Once verified, the name is entered in the  database.andM;''IntroVoice V is trained to recognize the vocal identification of about 400of the most commonly found objects.andP;  But Prodas has codes set up for morethan 5,000 possibilities.andP;  If the object is unusual, the scientist can speakthe code to enter it, or it can be entered from a keyboard.andP;  If the specieshas not been found before or does not normally exist in this environment,Prodas flags the entry and alerts the scientist.andP;  If the entry was in error,he can then correct the identification.andP;  Both the code and the coordinates onthe grid are stored in the Prodas database.''andM;Prodas has saved Newton an estimated $3,000 a month on mainframe analysistime, plus ''about a million and a half keystrokes so far, plus providing uswith instant verification of our identifications from the grids.''andM;For other applications, Kinnetic has programmed in more prosaicerror-trapping routines, such as comparing keyboard entries forsewage-treatment flow rates and chemistry to norms, and flagging values thatare out of range.andP;  After verification, Kinnetic often uploads data into anEPA mainframe database called the Ocean Data Evaluation System, which runsunder SAS.andM;Scott Jones is a programmer at Alpha Therapeutic Corp. in Los Angeles, whichtests pharmaceutical products, and records and analyzes the results inProdas.andM;''We flag data entry if values are out of range.andP;  We also have some fieldsset up so that, if one field is entered, another must follow,'' Jones said.andO;''And we often alias values--that is, we may have the operator enter a 1 thatis translated into 'Yes' for storage.andP;  Date formats that are typed in aretranslated into a standard format that we want used.''andM;He evaluates the Prodas language as follows: ''It's very powerful.andP;  But Iwish I could set up a character pattern for entry in a field and usequeries.''andM;Microstat IIandM;Ecosoft Inc.andM;This friendly, menu-driven program was contained on one diskette when it wasintroduced in 1978.andP;  It has grown to three diskettes, but is still easy touse despite many enhancements, including the rewriting of the entire programinto the C language.andM;It can be operated in interactive or batch mode, with a keyboard or mouse,and has on-line help in a movable window.andM;The many statistical features include several nonparametric tests, one-wayand two-way ANOVA with replication, advanced regression analysis, andextensive data transformations.andP;  Free-form transformation equations can beentered to generate new data, in effect making possible additional,user-created statistical procedures.andM;The menu system can be used to set up entry parameters.andP;  In addition toranges, the program supports the automatic use of transformations on fieldsduring data entry.andP;  For example, in a manufacturing quality-control study,measurements of the thickness of parts tested might be in thousands of aninch; a typist could enter the number 5 and have it converted automaticallyto .005, thereby speeding up data entry and reducing errors.andP;  Also variablescan be aliased; the typist could enter 1 or 2 and have the program displaythe values as Male or Female.andM;Ecosoft Inc. is at 6413 No.andP;  College Ave., Indianapolis, Ind.andP;  46220, (800)952-0472 or (317) 255-6476.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We've used several statistics packages, and Microstat is the most accuratein statistics returned and the most powerful,'' said Dr.andP;  Cleve Laird,president of Drail Consultants Inc., in Simi Valley, Calif., which runsclinical trials for pharmaceutical houses.andM;''It warns my data-entry people if they've entered a value that'sout-of-limits, and it's so simple that I can start new operators on it withno training at all,'' he said.andM;''Also, I appreciate its ability to transform the data.andP;  Often a client willwant the analysis presented in some other configuration than the way we'verun it, and usually we can make the change in the format in a matter ofseconds without reentering any data.''andM;Dr.andP;  Frank Black, who administers a health-promotion program at PurdueUniversity in West Lafayette, Ind., said ''Microstat II is so simple to usethat a student who is really computer-illiterate can enter date veryeffectively.andP;  It prompts by showing the name for each field variable.''andM;''We set up minimum and maximum acceptable values, and we do many transforms.andO;The program works very well for us.''andM;P-StatandM;P-Stat Inc.andM;Better known in the Unix environment, P-Stat is intended primarily for surveyuse.andP;  It offers frequently used statistical procedures such as analysis ofvariance, t-tests, and regression analysis and provides enhancementsincluding crosstabs and stub and banner displays.andP;  The basic price is $695,with an advanced tabs module adding another $395.andP;  Not available as yet:ARIMA, canonical correlation, nonlinear regression or survival analysis.andO;There is no graphics module, but the program can produce simple plots andhistograms.andM;There is a menu system, with on-line help.andP;  Program files require a total of5.5M bytes of disk storage.andM;P-Stat has a programming language that allows the creation of screens througha BUILD command that can establish data-entry ranges and allowable values.andP;  Afull-fledged data-entry module is under development, scheduled for release ina few months; it will cost $235 additional.andM;P-Stat Inc. is at 271 Wall St., P.O.andP;  Box AH, Princeton, N.J.andP;  08542, (609)924-9100.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Richard Pargament, president of Metis Associates, a consulting firm in NewYork, conducts frequent surveys for clients in the public education field.andM;''We've used P-Stat since 1966,'' he said.andP;  ''It's very powerful.andP;  We use itfor all of our stat work and file manipulation.''andM;He considers the programming language easy to learn and use.andP;  ''For ourdata-entry operators, we set up applications with range checks and acceptablevalues.andP;  We can even catch embedded blanks, where a typist may haveaccidentally hit the space bar in the middle of entering a number.andM;''We also do error-trapping on imported or existing data in batch mode, withautomatic error reports.andP;  And we use correcting transactions to clean updata.andP;  For instance, when we find values that are out of range, we can chooseto convert them to missing values.''andM;Jack Nunn, a consulting analyst at NCR Corp.'s world headquarters in Dayton,Ohio, agreed that ''it's very easy to do programming in P-Stat.andP;  For dataentry, you can set up ranges or almost any other verification routine youmight want.andP;  I've been using it for eight years.andP;  But I personally find itquicker to set up an entry procedure in a database program.andP;  At any rate,most of what we do is reading in external data from high-volume tapes, so ourerror-correcting is mostly cleaning routines in batch mode.''andM;At the National Wildlife Federation in Washington, where Rick Vicedomini isdirector of market research, he conducts surveys involving as many as 5,000 respondents.andM;''We're very impressed with P-Stat, but we wouldn't use it here for dataentry.andP;  The program needs a math coprocessor, takes up over 5M bytes ofstorage on a hard disk, and requires a full 640K bytes of RAM.andP;  We don't haveenough machines with all of those features to make it practical.andP;  We find itmore reasonable to send our data entry out to a firm that specializes inthat.andP;  However, P-Stat can compare one set of data against another forinconsistencies; and that would be a nice feature for companies that haveplenty of computers with the hardware requirements.''andM;SL-MicroandM;Questionnaire Service Co.andM;This product was specifically written for the analysis of questionnaires.andP;  At$250 it provides the basics in fine style.andP;  Although it has limitations, suchas a maximum of 200 variables in a run and a total of only 800 characterspermitted in a record, it will do crosstabs, t-tests, multiple regression,and analysis of variance.andP;  It will even report descriptive statistics bycategory.andP;  SL-Micro is command-driven; and the commands are very similar tothose in the long-established SPSS program, speeding up the learning processfor those who have previously worked with SPSS.andM;SL-Micro is contained on a single 360K floppy disk, including sample files.andO;The brief manual is very helpful and explains procedures for thoseinexperienced in statistical analysis.andM;The data-entry capabilities include restricting entry to specific values andinstructing the module to skip fields that are to be entered at some othertime.andM;Questionnaire Service Co. is at Box 778, East Lansing, Mich.andP;  48826, (517)641-4428.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We've used SL-Micro for four years and find it very handy,'' said JudyPfaff, president of Country Computing, DeWitt, Mich.andP;  ''We design, administerand analyze questionnaires for our customers.andP;  The work ranges from researchin the social sciences for Michigan State University to working on surveysfor Farm Bureau Insurance.andP;  Setting up a questionnaire for data entry withthis software is simple, and I hardly have to do any training with my entrypeople on how to use it.andM;''It creates standard ASCII files, so if I have to do analysis that's beyondits capabilities, I can transfer the data to StatPac Gold or to SPSS on amainframe and complete the job there.''andM;Robert Sendek is manager, computer services, for The Population Council, anon-profit research organization in New York.andP;  ''You can't set up ranges oruse conditionals in SL-Micro,'' he said, ''but you can enter any list youwant of specific values to be accepted.andP;  It can check entries for a validfield type, and it will cross-reference for valid labels.andP;  I've used it foreight years to gather and analyze family planning data from developingcountries.andP;  I find it very satisfactory.''andM;SASandM;SAS Institute Inc.andM;The SAS system originated as mainframe statistical software and has beenexpanded in recent years to include database capabilities that now constitutethe system's basic operating environment, called Base SAS.andP;  Many of the SASroutines have been converted for use on personal computers, althoughtime-series analysis, for example, is yet to come.andP;  SAS does not sell itsproducts; it licenses them on an annual basis.andP;  To use SAS on a single PCworkstation, it's necessary first to lease Base SAS at a cost of $495 for thefirst year and $250 a year thereafter.andP;  To add statistical capabilities, thetab is an additional $395 for the first year and $200 for subsequent years;these fees rent you the SAS/STAT module.andM;Despite the inviting color screens now available for PC use, SAS is stillcommand-driven software; it's necessary to learn those commands to makeanything happen.andP;  A new screen-control language, SCL, enables experiencedprogrammers to construct custom data-entry screens with error-trappingroutines such as cross-field validation, lookup tables, ranges, etc.andM;SAS has long been well regarded in mainframe circles but, as a matter ofpolicy, does not provide the PC version of their software to publications forreview.andM;SAS Institute is at Box 8000, Cary, N.C.andP;  (919) 467-8000.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''The tools for programming error-trapping in SAS on a PC are much betterthan you'll find in the mainframe version,'' commented Gregory Hislop,president of Working Knowledge Inc., a consulting firm in Newtown Square, Pa.andO;''That's because their new screen-control language hasn't been implementedfor mainframe use yet.andP;  Some of our clients are financial-management groupsand medical research facilities that often enter data on PCs.andP;  We find itvery simple to set up fields for them that will require range checks oraccept only specific values.andM;''SAS is a mature product, but SAS Institute has moved strongly to takeadvantage of the newer user-interface features now available, such aswindowing and the use of color.''andM;At Thomas J. Lipton Inc., in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., statistician LindaHirsch makes heavy use of custom SAS data-entry menus.andP;  As a case in point,she recently programmed a quality-control application for their Knox Gelatinsubsidiary in Sioux City, Iowa, where large amounts of statistical data mustbe entered and analyzed on a daily basis.andM;''We customize data entry in many ways,'' she said.andP;  ''We use required fieldsthat can be skipped by the operator, required field lengths--where threedigits will not be accepted if the field calls for four, checks for the typeof character--like catching a letter O typed in to represent a zero, ranges,lookup tables, lists of choices, and appropriate on-screen prompts.andM;''We also program in conditional skip patterns and do a lot of automaticformatting.andP;  If we want values displayed with a certain number of decimalplaces or date and time in specific formats, we convert the field entries bythe operator to the formats we want.''andM;In general, she is pleased with SAS.andP;  ''It was difficult at first to get usedto the different methods we had to use customize data entry in the PC versionafter using mainframe SAS for so long; the manuals are sometimes hard todecipher.andP;  Also, we don't like the hardware requirements for PCs.andP;  To use theprogram, we need at least a 40M-byte hard disk and 2M bytes of expandedmemory.andP;  And the leasing arrangement makes it very expensive.andP;  But we haven'tfound anything we want that it can't do.''andM;Open Access II PlusandM;Software Products InternationalandM;This is actually an integrated package, incorporating a relational database,spreadsheet, 3-D graphics, a word processor with spell-checking and mailmerging, communications, and accessories such as an appointment calendar anda calculator.andP;  For some time it's been the only integrated package to supportSQL.andP;  The reason the program is included in this MicroScope is that thecurrent version now has a statistical module too.andP;  Many Open Access customersare entering data into the database module, which has error-trappingcapabilities, then transferring the resulting tables into the spreadsheetwhere statistical analysis can be performed.andM;For each field there's a field attribute window, where users can specify anyevaluation or special handling wanted for data entered.andP;  Options includeautomatically entering the date in a date field from the system clock,calculated fields, acceptable ranges, the automatic incrementation of recordnumbers by one, required fields, default values, fields that must match thevalue entered with a value in a specified field of another file, and others.andO;In addition, an applications language called The Programmer enables thecreation of special screens with additional validation criteria.andP;  Open AccessII Plus sells for $695, including all options.andP;  Some modules are alsoavailable separately.andM;Software Products International is at 10240 Sorrento Valley Road, San Diego,Calif.andP;  92121-1605, (800) 621-7490; outside California, (800) 521-3511.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''Open Access gives us the flexibility we need,'' said Chet Briggs, presidentof Public Management Systems in East Calais, Vt.andP;  ''We can add anothervariable to a data set at any time and use the Programmer language to writealmost any kind of application we could image.''andM;The company serves as consultants in public sector planning.andP;  Often a projectwill involve a survey of the residents of a municipality regarding theirlong-range needs.andP;  ''We use all kinds of error-trapping,'' Briggs continues.andO;''The operator must enter the right kind of data (for example, no text in anumeric field), it must be within range or contain values found in lookuptables, or match a particular character pattern.andP;  We also employ requiredfields and conditional statements that can skip the cursor to a particularfield, depending upon the contents of the previous field.andM;''We think Open Access is a very strong program.andP;  As far as the statisticsare concerned, it does a good job of regression analysis, for instance, whichwe use a lot.''andM;Resource Sciences Associates of Armonk, N.Y., is a management consultingfirm, with clients like United Technologies and Westinghouse.andP;  Ted Stout,president, is an enthusiastic user of Open Access II.andP;  ''We do some veryinvolved projects.andP;  One involves managing a portfolio of corporate-ownedproperties all over the world.andP;  We have to keep track of the performance ofowned versus leased sites, manufacturing capabilities, and many otherattributes.andP;  We use the Open Access language for several kinds ofverification.andP;  We design entry screens, check data entered to be sure itfalls within established risk parameters, and we program conditionalexpressions into our screens too.andP;  When we download data from larger systemsthrough the communications module, we keep track of when that data was lastupdated or checked for accuracy.andM;''We use macros to transfer data from the database module to the spreadsheetfor statistical analysis.andP;  Then we issue reports; it's very easy to formatfiles so that we get very good-looking output.''andM;SORITECandM;Sorites Group Inc.andM;SORITEC stands for the Sorites Econometric System.andP;  It's a $595 program usedfor financial forecasting.andP;  The mainframe version was first released in 1978,and it has become a popular econometric statistical package around the world.andO;It's command-driven, and can be operated either interactively or in a batchmode.andM;Highly sophisticated forecasting procedures are supported, such as thesolving of simultaneous non-linear scalar equations and Newton's methodsimulation; simulation models are constructed through a SUPERF command, whichcombines a set of equations and formulas into a ''super-formula'' thatcalculates many variables with a single command.andM;The program is written in FORTRAN and occupies nine 360K-byte floppy disks.andO;It's copy-protected and requires a key disk in the A drive for operation.andO;Also, it will not run without a math coprocessor chip.andM;SORITEC includes a language that will support the development of customdata-entry procedures incorporating ranges, lookups, and conditionalrepositioning of the cursor.andP;  However, these capabilities are notwell-documented in the 775-page manual and require the services of anexperienced programmer.andM;The Sorites Group Inc. is at P.O.andP;  Box 2939, Springfield, Va.andP;  22152, (703)569-1400.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''I've been using SORITEC since 1982 when I was with the Bureau of theCensus,'' said John R. Norsworthy, currently professor of economics andmanagement in the Lally Management Center, Department of Economics, atRensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N.Y.andP;  He conducts many researchprojects for the business community, on topics such as the effect on profitsof foreign sales or a corporate R andamp; D program.andM;''We use the SORITEC language to create front-ends for data entry involvingerror trapping of several kinds,'' Dr.andP;  Norsworthy said.andP;  ''We useconsistency checks, and we have the computer compile independentcross-validation figures such as totals on the GNP and its components.andP;  Wealso use economic theory to catch entries that are out of bounds; forinstance, we generate plots showing outliers (those values that fall outsidethe normal range).andM;''We're very pleased with SORITEC.andP;  We can create models and save them veryeasily for reuse.andP;  We often do studies where we can simply change an SIC codeand rerun an analysis instantly for a different industry.andP;  And we can runvery large estimation jobs.andP;  For a Postal Service study, we've been usingmodels solving eight or nine equations simultaneously, with over 100parameters.''andM;In London, Timothy Delap has used SORITEC for 10 years.andP;  Formerly aneconomist and forecaster with the UK government, he formed his own consultingfirm two years ago, T.H.E.andP;  Delap and Associates.andP;  His clients include Cableand Wireless, the British equivalent of ATandamp;T.andM;''SORITEC is very flexible,'' he declares.andP;  ''You can sit down and use itinteractively and then build what you found into a program.andP;  It's absolutelymarvelous for quick development.andP;  Of course, you can create error-trappingroutines for keyboard entry.andP;  But you can also program batch files that willvalidate data you're importing and replace missing values.andP;  I wouldn't bewithout it.''andM;SPSS/PC+andM;SPSS Inc.andM;About 20 years ago, SPSS started providing reliable statistical analysis onmainframe computers.andP;  Although the command language was tedious to learn, thedocumentation was justly famous for constituting almost a complete course instatistics.andP;  When the PC version came along, at first it included only asmall subset of the procedures available on larger platforms; and it wascopy-protected, requiring an annoying key diskette to run.andM;The current version 3.0 was introduced only a few months ago.andP;  The proceduresavailable now include nearly anything imaginable, the copy protection isgone, the manuals are great, and easy-to-use menus are beginning tosupplement the command structure.andP;  This is another program written inFORTRAN, so it needs a lot of storage space.andM;The Base Package alone occupies 5.5M bytes of a hard disk and costs $795.andO;Advanced Statistics will add another $395.andP;  Tack on another $395 for graphicswith Microsoft Chart and $395 for time series forecasting (called Trends),and both the dollars and storage required start to add up.andP;  Other modulesavailable at extra cost include Tables, Mapping, and Graph-in-the-Box, forquick ''snapshot'' graphics.andM;Nevertheless, SPSS/PC+ Version 3.0 is strictly first class all the way andwell worth the expenditure.andP;  The $395 Data Entry II module is a good example,unmatched by competing statistical packages.andP;  It can be run as a stand-alonetool or from within SPSS.andP;  With it, custom entry forms can be designedwithout programming.andP;  Then myriad error-trapping routines can be built in,also without programming; among these are the establishing of valid entriesfor each field, ranges, computed and default entries and skip logic.andM;Portable data files can be built within Data Entry II, for uploading later toanother PC, or a mini or mainframe.andP;  Also data can be read in from ASCII orSYLK files, as well as programs such as dBase and Lotus 1-2-3, then''cleaned'' by running error-checking routines, and exported back into theoriginal format.andM;SPSS Inc. is at 444 No.andP;  Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill.andP;  60611, (312) 329-3300.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We've been using Data Entry II for nearly a year,'' said Kevin Olive, datamanager at Affiliated Systems Corp. in Houston.andP;  ''We work with largedatabases under a federal grant from the National Institute of Drug Abuse.andO;We don't use a lot of error-trapping schemes--mostly just value ranges.andP;  Butwe also like the fact that we can verify the data in this module before weupload it to a mainframe.andM;''We have had some trouble with the version 3 of the software.andP;  Occasionally,the system crashes, and we have to reboot.andP;  Part of the difficulty isprobably that we're using a LANtastic local-area network, which is notofficially supported by the SPSS package.andP;  Nevertheless, they've been verycooperative with us in trying to get to the root of the problem; butsometimes we've had to hold for a solid hour long distance to reach theirtechnical support  people.''andM;Kathy Rederscheid is market research administrator at Times-Mirror CableTelevision, in Irvine, Calif.andP;  They too have been using Data Entry II forabout a year.andP;  ''We do consumer research projects,'' she explains.andP;  ''We haveto enter and analyze the results of telephone surveys.andP;  We've found DataEntry II very easy to understand.andP;  The manual is very helpful.andM;''We set up acceptable ranges for many fields, and we also build skippatterns.andP;  For instance, if a customer answers yes to a certain question inthe questionnaire, we skip to one set of follow-up questions; if the answeris no, we ask a different set of questions.andP;  In the data entry process, theprogram automatically moves the cursor to the correct group of follow-upquestions.andP;  After the data entry is completed and checked for accuracy, werun crosstab procedures.andM;She continues, ''I particularly like the fact that we can duplicate theactual appearance of the survey.andP;  This is a big help.andP;  The operator doesn'tget out of sequence.andP;  It's a very good program.''andM;She reported no problems with the software or support.andM;SystatandM;Systat Inc.andM;Introduced over five years ago, Systat is strictly a command-driven programthat was intended to provide mainframe-type statistical capabilities on PCs.andO;Through the years more and more procedures have been added.andP;  Features rangefrom sophisticated time series analysis (Box-Jenkins, Fourier, etc.) to avariety of non-parametric statistics.andP;  What isn't included in the regularprice ($795 with an advanced graphics module or $595 without the fancygraphics) is offered in a series of extra modules, most of which are $90each.andP;  These include Probit and Logit, procedures often used in surveyanalysis; Testat, for the study of test results; Survival ($140), a group oftools for the analysis of survival or reliability data; and several others.andM;The source code is FORTRAN, so the installation of just the standard packagerequires a full 3.6M bytes of disk space, not counting the separate graphicsmodule or any other option.andP;  Data files are stored in binary format.andM;The command language is similar to BASIC and is supplemented by a new macrolanguage that can be used to write menu-driven applications and to createcustom data-entry screens with range-checking, validation, and othererror-trapping routines.andM;Because it's not menu-driven, Systat is relatively hard to learn; and thematerial in the 1,800 pages of documentation is often written on a levelabove the comprehension level of statistical beginners.andP;  But this is apowerful program, highly respected by professionals.andM;Systat Inc. is at 1800 Sherman Ave., Evanston, Ill.andP;  60201, (312) 864-5670.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We build custom decision-support systems,'' says Eugene Lieb, president ofCustom Decision Support Inc., Chadd Ford, Pa.andP;  ''One application we createdfor DuPont required the analysis of over 10,000 records that were stored in aFocus database on a mainframe.andP;  We wrote a program that would import the datainto Systat on a PC, verify it, run a series of statistical analyses, andcreate a series of graphs to help executives decide on a course ofaction--all automatically.andM;''We frequently enter data into Systat in this fashion.andP;  However, forkeyboard entry, I personally prefer to create an error-correcting model indBASE, compile it so operators can achieve maximum speed, and then import thedata as ASCII files into Systat.andP;  I prefer Systat to SAS because you can workwith only the small modules you need, rather than having to install a core ofabout 12M bytes just to get up and running.andP;  And programming in Systat isvery easy.''andM;Porter Horne is a statistical modeling specialist for The Gillette Co. inBoston.andP;  ''The macro module of Systat is a great general-purpose tool forcreating powerful front ends,'' he finds.andP;  ''Our people analyze qualityassurance data using a complete menu environment we've programmed in withthis macro capability.andP;  All entries are validated.andP;  We use conditionalstatements, where different answers to a question will lead to individualsubmenus.andP;  And we compare experimental data to control data whenever changesare made in the manufacturing process.andM;''After the completion of data entry, the information can be automaticallyanalyzed, annotated, graphed, and printed in a report.andP;  But the user cancustomize the process too.andP;  For instance, you can add a note to a graph orspecify a subset of the data for reanalysis.''andM;Horne is pleased by the fact that ''Systat is smaller than RS/1 and SAS.'' Headded, ''And we benchmarked the program against SAS and got exactly the sameanswers.''andM;StatPac GoldandM;Walonick Associates Inc.andM;This program can be run either through menus or by issuing commands.andP;  For$595 it supplies excellent tools for most statistical analysisproblems--interactive or batch processing, stepwise multiple regression andlogit and probit regression, crosstabs and banners, ARIMA, etc.andP;  It isparticularly strong in features needed for handling questionnaires andmarketing research.andP;  Graphics and windowing capabilities are included, aswell as a command programming language.andM;The source code is compiled BASIC.andP;  Three types of files are used.andP;  First,for each job, a codebook must be set up; this file contains a description ofthe data file format and also the labels to be used on printouts.andP;  The secondfile type is the data file itself, always stored in sequential ASCII format.andO;The third type is a procedure file, listing in sequence the analyses to berun on the data.andM;In addition, templates for data-entry can be created without programming.andO;After the template format has been designed, the sequence in which the cursorwill move is defined; then the variable parameters are specified.andP;  These caninclude whether or not the cursor will move to the next field automatically(without pressing Return) after the required number of characters have beenentered, whether or not characters entered should be converted to capitalletters by the program, skip codes for passing over certain variables such asquestions for women if the respondent has been identified as male, and validresponses that will be accepted for any field.andM;The 538-page manual is top-notch and clearly describes not only the operationof the program but the theory of the statistical procedures in terms that anynovice could understand.andM;The program is copy-protected, but purchasers can obtain a non-protectedversion at no additional charge by signing a usage agreement.andM;Walonick Associates is at 6500 Nicollet Ave.andP;  S., Minneapolis, Minn.andP;  55423,(612) 866-9022.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''It's very easy to set up custom menus in StatPac Gold,'' in the opinion ofDiane Arnold.andP;  She's data processing manager at NCG Research in Nashville,where they do marketing research.andP;  ''We can make screens that matchquestionnaires; this helps the operators.andP;  Then we eliminate a lot of entryerrors by specifying the values that will be accepted.andP;  We also set uprequired fields; this greatly reduces the amount of missing data.andM;''We really like the software.andP;  It's very user-friendly and can be runwithout a lot of training.andP;  We used the original StatPac for two years beforethe Gold version came along; the new version has a lot of additionalfeatures.''andM;Jim Riggs is president of Emmis Research, a division of Emmis Broadcasting, aprivately held company that owns and operates 11 radio stations throughoutthe country.andP;  Although Emmis Research has other clients, its principalactivity is conducting marketing surveys for the broadcast properties.andO;''We've used StatPac since 1983,'' said Riggs.andP;  ''It's really topnotch.andP;  Welike how easily we can run crosstabs on our variables.andM;''We use the Template Design feature to build data-entry menus; and we useall of the validation features provided, including the automatic numbering ofrecords.andP;  It's helpful to be able to do all of that without programming.''andM;At the famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., StatPac has been used since1985.andP;  ''We have an entire section of people working in medical statistics,''says Dudley Parsons, coordinator of their microcomputer education center.andO;''They bought six different PC stat packages and evaluated them.andP;  StatPacgave them exactly the same results on test files that they got using SAS onour mainframe, so they standardized on it.andM;''The data entry screens are wonderful.andP;  They're full-screen, and you canscroll back and forth through all of the fields in a record until you'resatisfied with them.andP;  I teach our people to 'bullet-proof their data.' Theyuse all of the capabilities--range checking, validation of codes, requiredfields, and so on.andP;  We can define the sequence the cursor will follow fordata entry, establish fields for conditional entry, convert a field to allcaps, and use automatic or manual page-down between multiple entry screens.andO;One thing we wish they'd add is the capability of defining default values fora field.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
