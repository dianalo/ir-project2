The authors have developed a metal-containinghydroxide - active carbon composite adsorbent and an AO resin adsorbentfor uranium extraction from seawater. The following are described: thedevelopment of inorganic adsorbents - the preparation of a metal-containinghydroxide - active carbon adsorbent, the forming of a titanium - activecarbon composite adsorbent, the extraction of uranium from seawater witha composite adsorbent; the development of organic adsorbents - the preparationof AO resin and uranium adsorption; the extraction of uranium from seawaterwith AO resin, the preparation of fibrous and bead-fibrous AO resin.(Mori, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
