Bristol, Tenn.; Cranston, R.I.; and St. Petersburg, Fla. alsowere sites of demonstrations by groups that have been protestingregularly since last summer outside abortion clinics.   Anti-abortion protests by apparently unrelated groups were heldin Columbia, S.C., and in Fort Wayne, Ind., where about 350pro-choice activists rallied across the street from more than 5,000anti-abortion demonstrators.   In Las Vegas, traffic officer Chet Gallagher was assigned to dutyelsewhere but rode a police motorcycle to the protest site andjoined the group following roll call, said police Lt. Steve Gammell.   ``One of the persons arrested was a Metro Police officer who wason duty at the time and in uniform,'' said Gammell. ``He chose tojoin the protest and became one of the protesters in an unlawfulassembly.   ``He refused to remove himself and he was arrested like everyoneelse,'' Gammell said. Police arrested a total of 91 people, he said.   Gallagher defended his action in a statement following hisarrest, saying ``I have a sworn responsibility to protect humanlife.''   Gallagher was placed on paid leave until an internalinvestigation determines whether disciplinary action should be taken.   The protest was staged by the Southern Nevada Operation Rescue,which is a chapter of the national anti-abortion group that hasmoved to close down abortion clinics by blocking their entrances.   In Woodbridge, N.J., eight anti-abortion protesters chainedtogether by their necks and legs inside a women's clinic later weredragged out of the building by police who brought special equipmentfrom New York to break the shackles.   Police arrested 17 others sitting or lying without chains insidethe Medical Care Center and charged them with trespassing for notobeying an order to leave the grounds, said Woodbridge police Lt.John Demarest.   Many of the protesters were from Operation Rescue's NewJersey-New York chapter. But none of the eight chained protesterswas from group.   The last two people removed from the center were chained togetherfor 12 hours and were carried out at about 8:30 p.m., police said.   Two of the eight were removed by local officials earlier in theday. The remaining six had to be unchained by a special squad of NewYork City police who used an electric grinder, police said.   At Cranston, R.I., about 60 protesters blocked the doors of anabortion clinic, closing the facility for 2{ hours before policecarried them away. An additional 150 demonstrators picketed on thesidewalk in front of the Women's Medical Center.   Thirty-two demonstrators in Bristol, Tenn., were arrested ontrespassing charges outside an abortion clinic, police said.   At the clinic in Woodbridge, administrator Ellen Samuel saidbusiness continued as usual during the protest and all the patientswith appointments showed up and were treated.   She said the protesters violated a civil order barring them fromthe property and that the center planned to pursue the matter incourt.   ``They always protest here on Saturdays and they marchpeacefully, and in the past they have respected the civil order,''she said.   In Columbia, S.C., nearly 2,000 people marched from theUniversity of South Carolina to the Statehouse on Saturday in adelayed protest of the anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. SupremeCourt decision legalizing abortion.   The rally was held six days after the anniversary of the decisionbecause several organizers had traveled to Washington a week ago toparticipate in a national march.   Police in St. Petersburg, Fla., arrested 150 abortion protesterscharged with trespassing Saturday morning during a sit-in at anabortion clinic, said Tom Kovalcik, a police spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
