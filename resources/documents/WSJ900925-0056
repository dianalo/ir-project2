The proposal from Sen. Donald Riegle would also radicallychange the handling of bank bailouts by forbidding federalregulators to take any action to protect deposits above the$100,000 insurance limit. Under the &quot;too big to fail&quot; policy,regulators in recent years have routinely sold failed banksand thrifts to other institutions in deals that protected alldeposits, even those exceeding $100,000. Many experts saytaming that policy is a key to limiting the government'sdeposit-insurance costs in the wake of the savings-and-loandebacle, expected to cost $150 billion excluding interest.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Riegle's plan is the most detailed deposit-insurancerevision proposal from a congressional leader, and alsoindicates that Capitol Hill, stung by political fallout fromthe Sandamp;L mess, is growing determined to take major action onthe issue next year. The Treasury Department is expected topropose broad deposit-insurance changes early next year.   The Michigan Democrat's proposal, which is similar in somerespects to recommendations made by Federal Reserve BoardChairman Alan Greenspan and the General Accounting Office,doesn't lower the $100,000 insurance limit or try to limitthe number of insured accounts an individual can have. Thoughsome important lawmakers, such as House Banking CommitteeChairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), have suggested suchchanges, a consensus seems to be emerging that requiringcertain stringent actions against troubled financialinstitutions can protect the government without spookingdepositors too much.   However, depositors would be limited to $100,000 ofinsurance coverage per bank or thrift under Mr. Riegle'sbill. Currently, depositors can hold multiple insuredaccounts in a single institution through joint accounts andaccounts held in trust for children. But Mr. Riegle wouldstill allow depositors to have as many insured accounts asthey wished at different institutions.   Under Sen. Riegle's proposal, a bank or thrift would besubject to restrictions once it fell below required capitallevels. The institution wouldn't be allowed to pay dividends-- as many undercapitalized institutions do now -- and wouldhave to restrict its growth severely. The bank or thriftwould also have to submit an acceptable plan to raisecapital. (Capital is the owners' investment in theinstitution, which is drained off before federal depositinsurance funds are called in.)   If the institution's capital continued shrinking,regulators would have to enforce other restrictions on itsactivities, and would soon thereafter have to take control ofthe institution or document why they didn't take control. Theaim of the plan is to make sure that when institutions dofail, their losses are minimal.   The proposal also calls for raising the required level ofcapital. Mr. Riegle doesn't specify a higher level, butrather calls on the regulators to set a new level that wouldprevent losses to the deposit-insurance funds for banks andthrifts. As a further incentive for banks to maintain highcapital, the proposal would also allow the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. to charge higher insurance premiums to bankswith low capital.   In addition, the plan would require the FDIC to licenseand regulate deposit brokers -- firms that place deposits forcustomers, usually scouring the country for the highestinterest rate.   While the FDIC wouldn't be allowed to cover uninsureddepositors beginning in 1995, the bill would continue toallow the Fed to intervene to protect uninsured depositors ifit believed the financial system could be destabilized.Despite that loophole, the provision is aimed at forcinglarge depositors to be more careful about the quality of thebanks and thrifts in which they place money.   Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Greenspan sounded a gloomy noteabout the banking insurance fund, saying that recentdevelopments underscores &quot;the pressing need for reform of ourdeposit insurance system.&quot;   In a four-page letter to the Senate Banking Committee, Mr.Greenspan said the banking insurance fund's &quot;reserves willremain under considerable pressure,&quot; even after banks nextyear begin paying premiums of 19.5 cents per $100 ofdeposits, compared with the current 12 cents per $100.   Mr. Greenspan cited the banks' move into riskierreal-estate lending recently, saying that growth in capitalhasn't kept pace with growth in risk. Nonperforming assets,he said, are at historical highs while the insurance fund isat an all-time low. Moreover, contingent liabilitiesassociated with bank assets held by the fund could also proveto be higher than expected.</TEXT></DOC>
