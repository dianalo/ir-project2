Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus declared a state of emergency Mondayin two flooded Delta counties.   Scattered new lowland flooding was reported in parts of Tennesseeand Kentucky, and some roads were reported blocked. Bowling Green,Ky., got 5.02 inches in 24 hours, the National Weather Servicereported. Columbus, Ga., got 1.43 inches in one hour during themorning and 3.42 inches in the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.   Flooding kept at least 500 people from their homes in southeastTexas and 200 in Mississippi. About 700 homes in Louisiana remainedflooded and the weather service said the flooding could continue fortwo weeks. Flooded roads isolated still more homes.   Texas, Louisiana and their neighbors have endured more than aweek of heavy rain from the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison. OneLouisiana town got nearly 29 inches in less than a week.   Allison and its aftermath were blamed for four deaths in Texas,three in Louisiana and three in Mississippi.   At Nashville, Monday's rain, plus heavy rain in June and a dampforecast, prompted the Corps of Engineers to lower the CumberlandRiver 4 feet to avoid possible flooding along Riverfront Park, wherea July 4 fireworks display is planned.   ``It's pretty muddy down there, but it shouldn't affectanything,'' said Kolleen Hudgins of the mayor's office.   Rising water chewed away at the earthen Mirror Lake Dam inLouisiana's Winn Parish, but civil defense director Steve Robertsonsaid Monday that officials believed the levee would hold.   A dam break would swell Saline Lake downstream, delaying drainageof houses already flooded and flooding several more, Robertson said.   The disaster declaration in Mississippi's Coahoma and Bolivarcounties is a step toward seeking federal disaster assistance andspeeding local and state aid.   ``The water has affected farmlands homes, roads, culverts,ditches and everything in the county,'' Bolivar County supervisorVictor Baioni said.   Bolivar County Agent Joe Love said Monday that cotton, soybeansand some other crops might not survive.   Officials said 33 inches of rain had fallen on the fields fromMarch 16 to July 2, about four times normal. Normal July rainfallfor Cleveland, Miss., is 4.3 inches, but officials said 6 inchesfell Saturday.   People were traveling in canoes in parts of Cleveland, saidresident Joe Springer. ``I've been sitting ... with my grandchildrenand as far as I can see it's water on the street both east andwest,'' he said. ``You've never seen so many kids out using thestreets for a swimming pool.''   While Allison's leftovers eased off toward the northeast, a freshstorm system bolted across Oklahoma and Texas on Sunday, blowingdown power lines, spinning off tornadoes and causinglightning-sparked fires.   Power outages affected 100,000 customers in the Dallas-Fort Wortharea alone, and at least 20,000 were still without power bymidafternoon Monday.   TU Electric, the area's primary electricity supplier, sent outpleas for help by phone, radio and television to workers off for theFourth of July holiday.   ``We have tried to bring in as many extra people as we can,''said Kathy Miller, a spokeswoman for TU Electric. ``We have peoplecoming from as far as Tulsa and Houston to help out. Everyone fromline crews to people who answer the telephone. We need everyone.''She said 1,000 additional workers had been brought in.   ``This is the worst storm damage in Dallas since the 1979 icestorm,'' said Dick Ramsey, a spokesman for TU Electric.   Storms also hit a Salvation Army community center, ripping holesup to 4 feet wide in the roofs of the center's building.   ``The wind was so forceful it just literally ripped this roof offand shot it like missiles off the top of the building,'' saidSalvation Army Maj. Milton Wood. The flying debris shattered windowsin the organization's bus and cars across the street.   The wind toppled commercial air conditioning units on one of thebuildings, and one of the units still was missing Monday. Watergushed into the center's library and gym when the wind knocked overa 2,100-pound exhaust fan and sent it through the roof.   ``At that time we had 12 kids in the building. We were bringingthe kids home from camp and we didn't want to take them home in theweather,'' Wood said. He said they took refuge in the vestibule ofthe center's chapel.   In Collin County, north of Dallas, homes and automobiles werepelted with hail as large as baseballs during a furious downpourSunday that lasted 15 minutes.   At Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, an Alabama and CharlieDaniels Band concert ended in chaos when a storm dumped heavy rainand hail on spectators.   ``It turned this place from a dust bowl into a mud bowl,'' saidSgt. Bob Matson. ``The hail was marble-sized for 20 minutes. Itdidn't matter where you were, there was no protection.''   Several people were treated for minor hail injuries andheat-related problems.   East of Abilene, a performance at the Shakespeare Festival ofDallas came to an abrupt end when officials evacuated 1,000 patronsminutes before the stage collapsed under 90 mph wind. No one wasinjured.   About 30 trees were uprooted and the 40-foot scaffolding holdinglights and sound equipment collapsed. Cast and crew huddledbackstage while the set crashed around them.   ``We're very thankful we got the patrons out,'' said StevePlayer, of the festival's board of directors. ``We're lucky we justgot soaked.''   In Oklahoma, the severe thunderstorms set a house afire inOklahoma City, blew over a Ponca City mobile home and knocked downpower lines and trees.</TEXT></DOC>
