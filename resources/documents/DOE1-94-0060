The ensemble-averaged fermion propagator agrees with thecontinuum propagator for distances greater than three average latticespacings. The results on the fermion condensate show that the chiralsymmetry of the doubled modes is broken in the continuum limit. The Goldstoneboson arising from the broken symmetry is revealed by examining the compositepseudo-scalar propagator. The doubled fermion and the Goldstone bosonboth acquire masses of the order of inverse lattice spacing and thusdecouple from the theory in the continuum limit.</TEXT></DOC>
