Gen. Prosper Avril declaredhimself leader of Haiti Sunday after ousting Lt. Gen. Henri Namphyin a military coup. Residents reported hours of gunfire Saturdaynear the presidential palace.   In an address on national television at 2:30 a.m. EDT, Avrilsaid the presidential guard he commanded had toppled NamphySaturday because it was ``sickened'' by the way Haiti had beengoverned.   Avril, a former adviser to President Jean-Claude Duvalier, saidHaiti will respect all international treaties, liberties and humanrights and said that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake ofnational reconciliation.''   Namphy was arrested and escorted under guard to theinternational airport late Saturday, a government spokesman said.   The Dominican Republic announced Namphy and Port-au-Prince MayorFranck Romain had requested and been granted political asylum inits Port-au-Prince embassy. It said they were in the embassy andwould be flown on a military plane to the capital of Santo DomingoSunday.   The reports on Namphy's whereabouts could not be independentlyconfirmed early Sunday.   The government reported Namphy's ouster several hours aftershooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the presidentialpalace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for cover inwhat appeared to be fighting between army factions, witnesses said.   Earlier, Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, had toldThe Associated Press soldiers were reportedly slain during thecoup, but no casualties were mentioned by Avril.   Rapid gunfire continued until about 11:45 p.m. Saturday.   Avril has been a key figure in Haiti's succession of governmentssince Duvalier fled to exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986.   He served as an adviser to a military-civilian junta headed byNamphy which succeeded Duvalier. Avril was forced to resign thatpost in early 1986 by anti-government demonstrations.   He then participated in the June 19 coup that toppled the4-month-old civilian government of President Leslie Manigat, whohad tried to transfer Avril from commander of the presidentialguard to an administrative post.   In his speech at the national palace, Avril promoted himself tolieutenant general and said he had been forced to act.   Speaking from the national palace before the presidential guard,Avril said: ``The presidential guard, sickened by the way thecountry has been governed since the 7th of February, 1988 ... hasbeen forced to act again.''   Manigat was named president Feb. 7, 1988.   Earlier, Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, had toldThe Associated Press that Dessalines Barracks Commander Jean-ClaudePaul had been named the new commander-in-chief of the army, butPaul was not mentioned during the address.   Behind Namphy, Paul was considered the most powerful figure inthe military regime.   Avril, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed inuniform during his address. He was introduced as ``the most honestofficer in the armed forces'' by Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, who worefull battle gear.   He reference to ``dialogue'' followed a similar proposal byopposition leader Marc Bazin. Bazin, a conservative leader of theCommittee for Democratic Understanding, recently said thedemocratic opposition and military government should meet. Bazinwas one of four leading candidates for president in the abortedNov. 29 civilian-run national elections.   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, Susan Clyde, said early Sunday thatthe new government made initial contacts with U.S. officials.   ``The stated intentions of this new government ... were tocorrect the abuses of the Namphy era, and to try to re-launch aperiod of change and progress for Haiti,'' she said. ``Andobviously we hope that the government will be able to carry outthese intentions.''   A usually reliable source, speaking on condition of anonymity,said an army major told him that a group of officers detainedNamphy after preventing him from entering the palace at 4:30 p.m.   Sources said the fighting involved army factions and members ofthe Tonton Macoutes, dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians duringthe 29-year-old dictatorships of the Duvalier family.   A French diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity and RadioMetropole said the shooting, including automatic gunfire, broke outaround 5 p.m. Satuday on the Champ-de-Mars Plaza, in front of thePresidential Palace and near the army general headquarters andDessalines Barracks.   Several dozen panicked people were seen running away from theplaza.   The coup came six days after about 20 thugs invaded the St. JeanBosco Roman Catholic church during a Mass being said by the Rev.Jean Bertrand Aristide, a critic of the military government.   The thugs, armed with guns, machetes and knifes, killed 13people and wounded 77 and then set fire to the church as soldierswatched from across the street.   That night, five men and a woman boasted on governmenttelevision that they took part in the massacre and on Monday thugsburned down a second Catholic church.   Some people in the St. Jean Bosco church during the attack saidthey recognized several City Hall employees among the assailants.   Namphy's government said it ``regretted'' the killings. It hasmade similar statements after earlier killings but no arrests wereannounced.</TEXT></DOC>
