Col. Oliver North raises new questions about Attorney General Edwin Meese's preliminary investigation into the Iran-Contra affair.    Lt. Col. Robert Earl has told congressional investigators that Col. North claimed to learn of the inquiry from Mr. Meese within hours after the decision was made to proceed with the investigation last Nov. 21. Col. Earl, also a Marine, was assigned with Col. North to the National Security Council.    &quot;North said Meese told him,&quot; said one investigator familiar with the closed-door testimony, which also indicates the attorney general discussed with Col. North whether the aide should seek legal counsel.    Without more corroborating evidence or an opportunity to question the participants, investigators are wary of making any judgment. Mr. Meese's office hadn't any comment when questioned yesterday, and Col. North has declined to comment since the controversy began. Still, the testimony is regarded as significant to understanding how the administration dealt with the brewing scandal last fall.    The issue of when Col. North knew of Mr. Meese's inquiry is crucial because on Nov. 21, the former White House aide suddenly began altering and destroying government documents related to his involvement in the Iran-Contra operation. If Mr. Meese suggested to Col. North that he seek legal counsel, it also would indicate that the attorney general anticipated more problems than he has previously acknowledged.    The Justice Department has been faulted for not bringing in the Federal Bureau of Investigation sooner, but Mr. Meese has repeatedly said there was no evidence on Nov. 21 that warranted FBI involvement. &quot;There was absolutely no indication of any illegality or any wrongdoing at that time,&quot; Mr. Meese told the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year.    It wasn't until his subsequent discovery of evidence indicating the diversion of funds from U.S. arms sales to Iran -- announced at a news conference last Nov. 25 -- that Mr. Meese saw the necessity of bringing in the FBI.    Mr. Meese has testified that the decision to proceed with a preliminary inquiry was made at a morning meeting with President Reagan and then Chief of Staff Donald Regan on Nov. 21. There are apparently conflicting accounts from the participants as to whether former National Security Adviser John Poindexter was at that meeting, but he is believed to have been informed of the decision soon afterward.    Adm. Poindexter, who had a detailed knowledge of Col. North's activities, potentially could have warned him of the inquiry. And Navy Cmdr. Paul Thompson, the former NSC staff legal counsel who has assumed new importance for congressional investigators, is likely to be questioned about the same point.    Prior testimony by Adm. Poindexter's predecessor, Robert McFarlane, indicates that as early as the fall of 1985, Cmdr. Thompson helped identify a list of classified documents that account Col. North's role in arming the Contras during a ban on U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents.    The White House later withheld the papers from Congress, and independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is now looking into Cmdr. Thompson's role and any possible consultation between Adm. Poindexter and Mr. Meese regarding the legality of Col. North's covert activities, according to sources familiar with the investigation.    Roy Burghart, who was the NSC's senior director for Latin American affairs, appeared last Friday before the grand jury probing the Iran-Contra scandal, and Vincent Cannistraro, the former NSC director for intelligence programs, testified yesterday.    Within days, the chief counsels for the House and Senate investigative committees are expected to begin questioning Col. North under a grant of limited immunity approved by the courts yesterday. The Marine officer isn't likely to appear publicly before late next month. Under a similar grant of immunity, Adm. Poindexter is also being questioned privately and is expected to testify publicly in the second or third week of July. </TEXT></DOC>
