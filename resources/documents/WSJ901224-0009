The new report provides the first thorough Westernsnapshot of the Soviet economy, and the image that emergeslooks more like Mexico than the U.S. Estimated annual incomeper capita in the Soviet Union, at $1,780 a year, is about10% of the $17,606 average income per person for Westernindustrialized nations and trails even the $2,465 average inEastern Europe.</LP><TEXT>   These figures imply that total Soviet output is littlemore than $500 billion, or about 10% of that of the U.S. Iftrue, many past estimates that accepted the official Sovietvaluation of the ruble -- including those of the CentralIntelligence Agency -- have greatly exaggerated the size andwealth of the Soviet economy.   The grim assessment predicts that Soviet national output,excluding services, declined 4% in 1990, and assuming presentpolicies persist, is set to shrink 5% or more in 1991.Inflation may be as much as 40% next year, and the nationalso has to cope with as much as $12 billion of its long-termforeign debt falling due at a time when its commercialcreditors are increasingly reluctant to lend.   &quot;The traditional centrally planned system has largelycollapsed, but hasn't been replaced by a functioning marketsystem,&quot; the study says. To improve the situation, the studyadvocates a decisive and irreversible program that includesliberalization of prices and the establishment of propertyrights. The economy also requires &quot;an early and effectiveclarification of the responsibilities between the union andthe republics,&quot; as well as far-reaching legal changes toprovide the basis for a complete refashioning of the Sovieteconomy.   The report should therefore provide some support forreformers in the Soviet Union, who are on the defensivefollowing the resignation of Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze last week.   The 2,000-page study, a 50-page summary of which wasreleased Friday, was commissioned at the Houston economicsummit last summer partly to settle a dispute between theU.S. and some European Community leaders over aid to theSoviets. The Europeans, particularly the Germans and French,were eager to rush large amounts of aid to Moscow, but theU.S. argued for a more cautious approach.   If anything, the report -- prepared by the InternationalMonetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development and the European Bank forReconstruction and Development -- is a vindication of holdingback substantial aid until there is much more commitment toreform.   The Soviets have expressed interest in joining these fourorganizations and other Western bodies, and the study isexpected to form a basis for the Soviets' continuingdiscussions with these agencies. In recent days, the U.S.suggested the Soviet Union apply for special associate statuswith the IMF, which could lead to full membership.   The new study does advocate some immediate but limitedWestern help for the Soviet Union: substantial technicalassistance, particularly to help with formulating policy,building Western-style institutions and a new legalframework; carefully supervised humanitarian food aid,especially to alleviate shortages in big cities; and somewell-monitored financing of selected projects. And, it says,larger support could play a useful role once the country isfirmly committed to a market economy and private ownership.   For the Soviet economy, the report generally advocatesorthodox Western economic policies, such as cutting thebloated budget deficit -- expected to total 8.5% of output in1990. Moderate credit expansion, firm wage and pricecontrols, and a more sustainable balance-of-payments policyalso are essential. A progressive opening up to foreigncompetition and investment also is needed, along with arealistic unified exchange rate, full convertibility of theruble and careful management of foreign debt.   The 1990 current-account deficit, excluding gold, isestimated at almost $11 billion, the study says. Exports ofgold, which are close to annual production levels, areexpected to net almost $4 billion in 1990.   Soviet foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $5 billionthis year, from $14.7 billion in 1989, as the countryfinanced itself by drawing down reserves and getting behindin its payments by as much as $5 billion. Declininginternational confidence led to a cut of $9.5 billion inforeign lines of credit, particularly short-term credits.Altogether, foreign debt declined to $52.2 billion from $54billion, as reserves were liquidated to make up for reducedforeign credit.   The study's statistics on the Soviet Union are similar tothose of Argentina or some other big developing nation.Proportionate to the population, the Soviet Union has only aquarter of the telephone lines of Western Europe andone-eighth the number of passenger cars. Fifteen millionSoviets are on the waiting list for a telephone. Eighteenpercent of all Soviet families have been on waiting lists forhousing for more than 10 years, and average per-capita livingspace is less than half that in Western Europe. Pricesubsidies account for more than 10% of gross domesticproduct.   Life is no better on the Soviet farm. Twenty percent ofthe Soviet wheat crop is lost through waste and inefficiency,compared with a loss of 2% of the wheat crop in the U.S.Spoilage and loss of fruit and vegetables run as high as 40%of the crop. Altogether losses in food production cost theSoviet Union about $20 billion a year, a sum equal to thevalue of the nation's annual food imports. Meanwhile, milkyields per cow are half those in the EC and 40% of those inthe U.S.   Nevertheless, the Soviet Union has vast natural resourcesand formidable potential, as the study recognizes. It alreadyaccounts for 22% of world oil output and 40% of world gasoutput, and is the world's largest producer of iron ore, zincand nickel, and the second-biggest producer of gold andaluminum.</TEXT></DOC>
