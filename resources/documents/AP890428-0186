Police officials said injuries occurred, but they had no figures.   In the southeastern industrial cities of Changwon and Masan,about 6,000 striking workers hurling rocks and firebombs tangledwith police for a fifth day, police said.   Strikers in Changwon poured oil on streets and set them afire,and protesters in Masan used slingshots to pelt police with piecesof scrap metal, they said. About 20 workers were arrested.   Student and dissident groups are trying to unite with workers tobuild an anti-government alliance.   Government leaders are concerned about the growing labor unrestand a wave of increasingly violent strikes for more pay andimproved working conditions.   Police arrested 20 student delegates as they tried to reach theborder to meet with North Korean counterparts. The students wantedto discuss taking part in an international youth festival in thenorth's capital of Pyongyang in July, and ways to unite the twoKorean states.   At Seoul National University, black police vans armed withmultiple launchers fired hundreds of tear gas rounds into the ranksof 4,000 students fighting officers with wooden clubs, pipes andfirebombs while trying to march out of the campus. Fighting flaredaround the sprawling campus in southern Seoul, with about 3,000riot police surrounding the school.   Hundreds of students fought police on at least four other Seoulcampuses.   Student clashes also broke out in the southern port of Pusan andradicals seized a government prosecutors' office in Taegu,according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.   Student leaders lashed out at South Korean President Roh Tae-wooand the United States in rallies before the clashes, accusing themof perpetuating the division of the Korean peninsula, split intocommunist north and capitalist south after World War II.
