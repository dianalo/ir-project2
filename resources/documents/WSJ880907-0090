Separately, the St. Louis-based aerospace concern announced aircraft orders totaling $1.2 billion from foreign buyers.    McDonnell said the new plane, which would compete with Seattle-based Boeing's 747 series, could be on the market by 1994. It will be 235 feet long, four feet longer than Boeing's new 747-400, the company said. The previously announced version of the MD-11, now being manufactured, is 200 feet long.    The new plane, like the 747-400, is to have two levels for passengers -- a main level and a lower &quot;panorama deck.&quot; The 747-400 has an upstairs deck. The new MD-11 and the 747-400 both could seat around 600 passengers, depending on the seating configuration.    The new MD-11 will have a range of about 8,000 miles, compared with 6,000 miles for the models now being built. Both MD-11s will have three engines.    Delta is expected to place orders for as much as $6 billion of jets this year, including 30 to 40 jumbo aircraft and 70 to 100 smaller twin-jet models.    &quot;The new MD-11 seems to be their way of going after the Delta order,&quot; said Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    If Delta buys McDonnell Douglas's new jumbo jet, it might be the prelude to an order for the planned MD-90, a series of &quot;prop-fan&quot; planes that combine qualities of jet and propeller engines. Delta has expressed interest in those planes, some analysts said. At the least, a Delta order for MD-11s could help finance development of the MD-90, which would cost more than $500 million and is still on the drawing board.    McDonnell Douglas has been considering building a jumbo jet in a joint venture with the European Airbus Industrie consortium. But those talks have been faltering, and the announcement to build the stretched MD-11 may signal the end of that proposed project. Although both parties said the Airbus-McDonnell talks will continue, neither expressed optimism.    &quot;They always seemed to have a very hostile relationship,&quot; Prudential-Bache's Mr. Nisbet said.    Jean Pierson, president of Airbus Industrie, said talks over possible collaboration face &quot;tremendous difficulty.&quot; Discussions had included using an MD-11 fuselage and modified wings from Airbus's new A-330 model. However, McDonnell Douglas said yesterday that it has begun sounding out possible Asian partners for a $1 billion joint venture to produce new wings for the larger MD-11.    Those approached, the company said, include several Japanese companies and the government of China.    McDonnell's announcement on foreign orders for commercial jetliners said Alitalia, the Italian national airline, ordered 27 twin-engine MD-80 aircraft valued at about $830 million. The aircraft will be delivered between 1989 and 1992.    It also said the Taiwanese government ordered four standard MD-11 aircraft estimated to have a value of about $400 million. Delivery is planned from 1992 to mid-1994. </TEXT></DOC>
