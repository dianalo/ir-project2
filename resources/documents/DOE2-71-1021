<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-1021 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Windflower wind power plant was designed and developed for power productionin isolated operation without using too sophisticated a technology. Thisplant produces alternate current of a constant frequency which is controlledby switching on or off ohm-type control loads. Hence, any electricalconsumer may be used in principle. The rotor (6 m diameter) has fourrotor blades made from glass-fibre-reinforced plastics. This wind energyplant has been in permanent operation at the DFVLR test field in Schnittlingen/SchwaebischeAlb since June 1987. Test phase is scheduled for one year.</TEXT></DOC>
