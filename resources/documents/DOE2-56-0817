<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-56-0817 </DOCNO><TEXT>Resonant Raman scattering has been used to study the confined LO modesand interface modes near the lowest direct band gap of a GaAs/AlAs superlattice.We have studied the polarization dependence of the resonance profilesin detail. The peak positions of the polarized and depolarized resonanceprofiles are not the same. When the laser is polarized along (110) or(11-bar0), we see an interference effect for some of these modes similarto that seen by Menendez and Cardona in bulk GaAs. In bulk GaAs, thisinterference is an intrinsic effect. In superlattices, this effect isa violation of the selection rules for confined LO modes; we attributethis ''forbidden'' scattering by confined LO modes to an impurity-inducedFroehlich mechanism.</TEXT></DOC>
