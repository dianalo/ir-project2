The agency acknowledged several weeks ago that it wasconsidering cuts of that magnitude because five years ofdrought have badly depleted federal reservoirs in California.</LP><TEXT>   Almost all the water provided by federal projects inCalifornia goes to farmers. State water officials alreadyhave cut off farmers completely from state water, and theMetropolitan Water District, a big water supplier in SouthernCalifornia, has slashed its farm deliveries by 50%. Thefederal move is more significant, because federal projectssupply far more farm water than the two other agenciescombined.   The federal cuts mean that California farmers this yearwill receive only about a third of the water they normallyget from state and federal water projects, barring torrentialrains. Ground water still supplies more than half of thewater used by California agriculture; it isn't regulated, butin many areas, wells are beginning to run dry.   Farmers have predicted losses of several billion dollarsthis year from the drought. State economists generally thinkthat's too high, forecasting losses of between $1 billion and$2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
