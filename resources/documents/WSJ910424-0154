The agreement includes general wage increases of 3% ineach of the first two years and 4% in each of the next two,according to Ned Scott, chairman of the union's bargainingcommittee. Workers would also receive a 4% lump-sum paymentin 1992.</LP><TEXT>   Although these terms weren't quite as good as those wonlast year by Machinists union members at several aerospacecompanies, they appeared an improvement over those in theexpiring 4 1/2-year UAW contract. That pact, a McDonnellDouglas spokesman said, provided only two general wageincreases of 2%. Workers also received a $200 signing bonusand four annual 4% lump-sum payments. Union leaders generallyprefer salary increases to one-time bonuses because benefitsare often tied to base wages.   Nonetheless, several local union officials indicated thatthey were unhappy with the offer and plan to express theirfeelings in a flier to the rank and file today. Themembership has already authorized the leadership to call astrike if it so desires.   McDonnell Douglas officials declined to comment.   The proposed contract, which covers about 23,000 activeworkers and 7,000 retirees from four locals, would expireApril 16, 1995. The majority of the workers are based inLongBeach, where McDonnell Douglas builds MD-11 and MD-80commercial jets and the C-17 military cargo plane.   Mr. Scott said it wasn't possible to get more than theone-year bonus this time because of McDonnell Douglas's&quot;negative cash flow problems.&quot; The company has been beset bydevelopment expenses on several new airplanes and has takenwriteoffs for cost overruns on several military projects.   &quot;It was very tough bargaining,&quot; he said. &quot;Negotiators goteverything they could from the company.&quot;   Specifically, Mr. Scott said health insurance benefitswere maintained with slightly improved coverage in someareas. Additionally, he said, retirement benefits weresweetened. Current pension benefits are $23 a month for eachyear of service. The benefit would increase to $29 a monthstarting next month and to $32 next January.   Separately, McDonnell Douglas confirmed that it is in&quot;discussions&quot; with General Dynamics Corp., which suppliesfuselages for the MD-11, over &quot;production, deliveries andpayments.&quot; The companies said they expect a resolution soonwith no impact on the program. They wouldn't elaborate.   Their statements came after a report in the San FranciscoChronicle said General Dynamics stopped shipments toMcDonnell Douglas last week because it hadn't been paid forsending the two previous fuselages.   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the one fuselage duelast week arrived on time, and that none was due this week.The talks, he added, don't &quot;involve a liquidity problem&quot; atMcDonnell Douglas.</TEXT></DOC>
