Prosecutors said they arrested Hisashi Shinto, former chairman ofNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., and a senior aide, Kozo Murata.   Investigators alleged the two officals were bribed with 10,000shares of unlisted stock that Murata was offered by Recruit Co., aninformation conglomerate. Murata, 63, reportedly made $170,000 inprofits when the stock was publicly traded and rose quickly in value.   Shinto, 78, was known as an advocate of clean government andbusiness until he resigned from NTT in December after acknowledgingthat $70,000 of the profits had ended up in his personal bankaccount.   The remaining $100,000 allegedly was used for illegal politicallobbying.   The arrests followed the bribery indictments Saturday of fourother businessmen _ the founder of Recruit, Hiromasa Ezoe, anotherRecruit executive and two former NTT officials.   Justice Ministry officials said prosecutors added another countMonday to the charges against Ezoe _ offering bribes to Shinto andMurata.   Ten people have been arrested in the scandal, of whom five havebeen indicted. Three Cabinet members also have resigned because ofRecruit links.   Takeshita, who acknowledged an aide bought 2,000 shares ofRecruit stock, has denied any personal involvement and pledgedSunday to restore public confidence in his government by pursuingpolitical reform.   Takeshita told Parliament Monday he was willing to turn overdocuments related to his aide's purchase of the shares, ``but itaffects third parties and banks used by my secretary, so I feel Ineed to consult with them.''   Opposition parties have demanded officials implicated in thescandal testify in Parliament under oath.   The three largest opposition parties have united in demanding afull parliamentary investigation into the scandal. The oppositionSocialists and Communists have demanded that Takeshita resign ordissolve the lower house.   Newspapers reported members of the governing party have begunconsidering a caretaker government should additional arrests orpublic pressure force Takeshita to resign.   Some party leaders also are discussing the possibility of adissolution of the lower house, requiring new elections, ifTakeshita does not resign soon, news reports said.   Public support for the Takeshita Cabinet has dropped steadily inthe past five months due to the scandal, as well as government plansto levy a 3 percent tax on all services and goods in commercialtransactions, according to media polls.   Party members want to hold off elections as long as possible,said Seisaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University.   An election loss for the party could force Takeshita to step downas governing party president and prime minister before his two-yearterm ends this fall.   Rei Shiratori, dean of the department of political science andeconomics at Tokai University, said: ``If you look at opinions ofvoters, things are changing, but that only has an effect if there'san election. So if Takeshita is able to hold off having an election,there won't be much direct effect on politics.''</TEXT></DOC>
