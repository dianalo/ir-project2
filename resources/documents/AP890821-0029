The value of Japan's assets in 1987 jumped sharply from $28.3trillion worth of assets in 1986, said Nihon Keizai Shimbun, thecountry's top economic daily, quoting figures from the U.S. FederalReserve Board and Japan's Economic Planning Agency.   In 1985, Japan's assets were $19.6 trillion, $11 trillion behindthose of the United States, the paper said. It said the statisticsat the end of 1987 were the latest available from the two countries.   Officials of the Economic Planning Agency said the statisticsfrom Japan and the United States were issued separately toward theend of last year, but the agency did not make any specificcomparison.   Contributing to the rise in Japan's assets were soaring stock andland prices, coupled with a nominal increase in the overall nationalassets due to the Japanese currency's appreciation against the U.S.dollar, the report said.   On a yen basis, Japan's national assets rose by 17 percent in1987 over the previous year, mainly because of increases in stockand land prices, while the yen's value against the U.S. dollar rose54 percent in 1987. The yen rose from about 160 yen to the dollar toabout 122 yen from the end of 1986 to the end of 1987, the reportsaid.   Today, the dollar closed at 143.35 yen, down 0.17 yen fromFriday's close.   National assets are the total value of financial assets such asstocks and deposits and insurance, and actual assets such asproduction facilities, housing, land and inventories.   According to U.S. Federal Reserve Board figures, the UnitedStates had $30.6 trillion in assets at the end of 1985, $34 trillionworth in 1986 and $36.2 trillion in 1987, the newspaper said.   It said financial assets accounted for 53 percent of Japan'stotal national assets, while the value of land made up 30 percent.   Masaru Yoshitomi, chief of the Economic Planning Agency'sEconomic Research Institute, told the paper that the scale ofJapan's national assets ``shows Japan has increased its position notonly in industrial competitiveness, but also in a very importantpart of the national power of financing.''   The government reported last year Japan had record net overseasassets of $240 trillion in 1987, making it the world's largestcreditor nation for the third year in a row.</TEXT></DOC>
