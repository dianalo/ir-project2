Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi arrived Sunday and issued astatement saying, ``If the movement does not modernize, it can beconsidered dead.''   Col. Gadhafi sent in advance a Bedouin tent and four camels andat a news conference in the tent he suggested the kidnapping ofWesterners in Lebanon was in response to Western intervention in theMiddle East.   ``I believe Western countries should withdraw from the MiddleEast and not intervene in the internal affairs (of those countries)or else their citizens shall be victims,'' he said.   He described the Western hostages held by extremists in Lebanonas ``innocent victims due to the intervention of their respectivegovernments'' in the Middle East.   Gadhafi was asked about the possible release of the hostages andhe said if he could help ``I would never delay'' efforts. But hethen added, ``If we knew who kidnapped them we could talk to'' theabductors.   Gadhafi, wearing a silk robe, black cape and white turban, spokethrough an interpreter at the news conference that began at 11 p.m.   He said, ``We do not recognize any U.S. role in any of therespective (Mideast) countries,'' and that also was true of Franceand all other Western nations.   Eight Americans are among 16 foreign hostages held in Lebanon.Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Gadhafi's tent was erected in a park in Belgrade's Dedinje suburb.   Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek, in an interview publishedSaturday, said streamlining the non-aligned movement is the keyissue of the four-day conference. His foreign minister, BudimirLoncar, said the movement must modernize its political activities.   For the first time, the movement of leftist, centrist andconservative leaders is scheduled to deal with human rights.   After two days of talks, foreign ministers from member countriesearly Sunday adopted a main conference document for consideration bythe summit.   The draft refers to the ``struggle against imperialism,colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, apartheid and all forms ofdomination.''   But the Palestine Liberation Organization failed to have includedin the document a condemnation of Zionism.</TEXT></DOC>
