Therefore the velocity and turbulencein a combustion chamber of a spark ignition engine are measured by meansof a laser Doppler anemometer with fiber-optic pick-up under firing conditions.The engine is operated at a speed of 2500 rpm with propane-air mixtures.Data acquisition window width affects the turbulence intensity ({mu}')and integral time scale of turbulence (Lt) of the analysis. In the experiment,a short (0.67 ms) and long (4 ms) window are selected and compared witheach other. In the combustion period, twice the intensity of {mu}' andan increase of 40% in Lt are observed in the case of short window analysis.A stronger {mu}' and larger Lt are observed in the long window analysisand it is shown that the Lt expands laterally during the compressionstroke and vertically during the expansion stroke.</TEXT></DOC>
