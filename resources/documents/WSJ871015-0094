Terms weren't disclosed, but Clayton andamp; Dubilier's chairman, Martin H. Dubilier, said the purchase price is &quot;well in excess of $100 million.&quot; The companies said the agreement is contingent on completion of a new labor contract.    The move appears to be another effort by closely held Safeway to reduce debt incurred in its $4.2 billion leveraged buy-out last year. Since the buy-out, the Oakland, Calif.-based supermarket chain has sold its British unit, its Liquor Barn operation and divisions in Salt Lake City, New Mexico and Texas.    Clayton andamp; Dubilier said the Oklahoma division runs 106 supermarkets in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas. The division has annual sales of about $700 million, the firm said.    Mr. Dubilier said the firm would own about 80% of the Oklahoma division, with senior division officials owning the rest. He said he hopes to complete the purchase early next month, pending the completion of labor talks with a union representing 5,000 division workers.    Mr. Dubilier said that the unit's salary structure is &quot;way out of line,&quot; and that he hopes to reduce workers' salaries to make costs more competitive.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
