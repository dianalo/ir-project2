Even the military's defenders concede that its recent record should have been better, and some experts now contend that as the U.S. prepares for a change of administrations, it should rethink both the structure and the missions of the American military. &quot;I really think we need to change the way Defense does business,&quot; says former national security adviser and retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft.    A debate about whether the U.S. military is better off today than it was eight years ago could be a profound embarrassment for President Reagan and his vice president and would-be successor, George Bush. Congressional Democrats must share the blame for the military's shortcomings, but no one spent more on the peacetime military, believed more deeply in high technology, or prided himself more on restoring the nation's strength than Mr. Reagan.    Although Mr. Reagan vowed not to allow a repeat of the Carter administration's failed 1980 attempt to rescue American hostages in Tehran, which helped catapault him into the White House, his administration has been plagued by a series of military debacles. In Beirut, 241 servicemen died at the hands of one Shiite terrorist; one Navy pilot was killed and another captured in a bungled attempt to bomb Syrian anti-aircraft missile sites in Lebanon; 37 seamen were killed when an Iraqi missile hit the frigate U.S.S. Stark; and now the Navy's $500 million Aegis air-defense system has shot down a civilian jetliner.    Even some of the military's recent successes have been marred by miscues. During the 1983 invasion of Grenada, for example, a fleet of transport planes was late because planners misconverted Greenwich Mean Time to local time.    The 1986 U.S. air raid on Libya was judged a success, but the performance of the Air Force's F-111 bombers was disappointing. Only two of the nine planes sent against Col. Moamar Gadhafi's headquarters dropped their bombs at all; neither hit its target precisely. One crew either was shot down or crashed, and another made a navigational error and attacked a civilian neighborhood.    The setbacks haven't been the fault of America's fighting men: The pilots and others on the Iran rescue mission displayed almost superhuman courage, as did the damage control teams aboard the Stark. And the fact that the military has had trouble in the Middle East doesn't mean it would fare as badly, or even worse, against its primary foe, the Soviet Union. In fact, Americans sometimes have been handicapped in lesser conflicts because so much of their equipment, training, and organization are designed for a showdown with Moscow.    The administration's critics argue that while it was spending billions of dollars buying high-tech whiz-bangs for World War III with the Soviets, it was sending Americans into Third World conflicts with the wrong equipment, incredibly convoluted chains of command, often naive rules of engagement, and frequently without a clear idea of their job.    For instance, the Aegis wasn't designed to operate in a mixed civilian and military environment like the Persian Gulf.    But the military's most fundamental problems recently have been political, not military. In its eagerness to confront communist aggression and to reverse the impression that the U.S. is a &quot;pitiful, helpless giant,&quot; the administration -- often over the objections of former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- has tried to make military power a basic tool of its foreign policy.    &quot;Traditionally, the United States hasn't used the military as an instrument of foreign policy,&quot; says Gen. Scowcroft. To avoid controversy, the Reagan administration often has tried to make military missions as innocuous as possible. In Beirut, for example, the Marines were ordered not to load their weapons.    A combination of ambitious aims and relatively modest means, coupled with the Pentagon's infatuation with technology and its tangled organization, may have put America's fighting men exactly where Ronald Reagan promised he would never leave them: without either the political support or the tools they need to win the fights they have been given. </TEXT></DOC>
