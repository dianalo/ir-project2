Because of uncertainty that automobile and industrial pollutantsare heating up Earth's climate, ``I would be loathe to tell Detroitthey can't build big cars any more or tell Exxon to cut oilproduction,'' said climate researcher Tim Barnett, of the ScrippsInstitution of Oceanography in La Jolla.   Debate over global warming took place at the AmericanGeophysical Union's fall meeting.   The ``greenhouse effect'' theory says that carbon dioxide andother gases emitted by burning industrial and automobile fuel isaccumulating in Earth's atmosphere, acting like greenhouse glass totrap heat from sunlight.   Computer simulations suggest that by the middle of the nextcentury, Earth's average temperature may rise 4 to 9 degreesFahrenheit, possibly altering storm patterns, triggering droughtsand crop failures and raising sea levels to flood low-lying coastalareas.   If humans keep burning fossil fuels at present rates, addingmore carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, ``by the year 2050 we'regoing to have tremendous climate changes far outside what man hasever experienced,'' said James Hansen, director of NASA's GoddardInstitute for Space Studies.   Lindzen countered: ``It's equally easy to support scenarioswhere nothing happens.''   He argued that a warming of Earth's surface spurs creation ofmore cumulus clouds and makes them rise higher, which in turnblocks enough sunlight to counteract greenhouse heating.   Barnett said the greenhouse effect's ``potential consequencesare scary as hell.'' But he and others question whether computerforecasts of climatological doom are valid.   That's because so far they have been unable to find evidence tolink greenhouse gases to the one-half-degree warming observedduring the past century.   Analysis of warming since 1881 shows that most of that increasein global temperature happened before 1919 _ before the morerecent, sharp rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere, said Thomas Karl, of the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center inAsheville, N.C.   While global climate warmed overall since 1881, it actuallycooled during the period from 1921 to 1979 before warming again,Karl said.   ``In spite of all the well-publicized concern about globalwarming, you must understand that there is still considerableuncertainty among scientific experts about a number of criticalfactors which determine global warming,'' NOAA administrator JohnKnauss said in a statement.   The researchers agreed they need to stop arguing and do betterresearch to learn if the greenhouse effect is under way and will beas severe as Hansen and others believe.   Hansen spurred controversy when he told a U.S. Senate committeehearing during the hot, dry summer of 1988 that he was almostcertain greenhouse warming already had begun.   Other scientists at Wednesday's news conference said that ifthat's true, they can't detect such warming since it is so smallcompared to temperature variations caused by changes in solar heatoutput and other natural factors.   Hansen said that to reduce the prospects for radical climatechange, there many things that can be done without great cost.   Such steps include phasing out chlorofluorocarbon gases _ whichharm Earth's protective ozone shield and warm the atmosphere _improving energy efficiency to reduce fuel burning, and recyclingnewspapers to save trees that consume carbon dioxide, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
