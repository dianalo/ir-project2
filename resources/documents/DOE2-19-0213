TheseMRI studies were performed using a spin-echo multislice technique witha 0.5 Tesla superconducting magnet, Picker International Corp. Scanswere made in transverse planes between diaphragma and kidney. Usualythe echo time delay was 40 msec and the repetition time was 400 msecor 460 msec. We used T2 weighted pulse sequences, too. The spleen wasdetected clearly in all controls. On the other hand, in 7 patients spleenwas not detected, whereas in one patient spleen was observed. On T2 weightedimages the spleen could be differenciated from a liver more clearly.In conclusion MRI can be useful technique for diagnosis of asplenia syndromenoninvasively.</TEXT></DOC>
