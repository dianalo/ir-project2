Stock speculator Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis, 50, unexpectedlyentered a guilty plea Wednesday to three felony charges involvingalleged fraud in the trading of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock more thanthree years ago.   The guilty plea by Lewis, a well-known Wall Street figure andformer special adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission,came a month before he was to go on trial for charges his lawyeroriginally denounced as ``a piece of garbage.''   On Aug. 17, Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. trader Robert Freeman, alsoimplicated as an indirect result of the Boesky scandal, said hewould plead guilty to a single felony count for insider trading inBeatrice Cos. stock in 1986. Freeman originally had asserted hisinnocence.   It was not immediately clear why Lewis changed his position.Neither he nor his lawyer, Stanley Arkin, would comment.   But many lawyers have speculated that recent jury guilty verdictsin two other cases, involving takeover speculator Paul Bilzerian andpartners in an investment partnership called Princeton NewportPartners, convinced other defendants that juries are willing to dealharshly with suspects in white-collar fraud crimes.   Lewis entered the pleas before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood tocharges of manipulating the price of Fireman's Fund common stock,aiding and abetting the falsification of records and stock-marginviolations.   In addition, his brokerage firm, S.B. Lewis andamp; Co., pleaded guiltyto two counts of securities laws violations.   In a statement before the judge, Lewis did not provide a motivefor the stock manipulation.   The charges against Lewis carry a total maximum 15-year prisonterm and $2.75 million in fines. His company faces up to $1 millionin fines. A sentencing conference was set for Sept. 25.   Lewis and his brokerage were named in a 22-count indictmenthanded up by a federal grand jury Nov. 3. The indictment claimedLewis manipulated Fireman's Fund stock price just before AmericanExpress Co. announced the sale of Fireman's Fund shares in 1986.   Lewis had a close working relationship with American Express, oneof the nation's biggest financial services companies and parent ofShearson Lehman Hutton Inc., a leading Wall Street investment house.   American Express was not named in the indictment but wasportrayed as the intended beneficiary of Lewis' alleged scheme. Thecompany denied any wrongdoing and said it had cooperated withinvestigators.   American Express reiterated its position after Lewis entered hisguilty plea.   In a press statement the company also said: ``We conducted ourown internal investigation and concluded that no one at AmericanExpress was involved in any wrongdoing whatsovever. We have had alongstanding business relationship with Mr. Lewis. We have alwaysregarded him as a man of integrity and high profesional competenceand we are saddened by this episode.''   Charges against Lewis stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea of BoydJefferies, former head of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferies andamp;Co. who turned state's evidence. Jefferies had been implicated byBoesky, the now-imprisoned speculator who settled insider tradingcharges in November 1986.   Federal prosecutors alleged Lewis requested two unidentifiedJefferies employees to buy more than 400,000 shares of Fireman'sFund on May 8, 1986, in an attempt to drive its price up to $38 ashare, substantially above its price at the time.   The indictment also accused Lewis of promising to reimburse theJefferies employees for any losses and of hiding his role throughphony records.   On May 9, 1986, American Express announced it would sell 8million shares of Fireman's Fund at $41.50 a share. It eventuallymade a profit of $88 million from the sale.</TEXT></DOC>
