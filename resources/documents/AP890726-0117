Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who hadbeen viewed as a key undecided vote.   ``I do not support William Lucas because he is black but I dobelieve his background will give him special insights into thecivil rights laws,'' Specter told the Senate one day after ameeting with the candidate.   Specter, until now seen by Lucas critics as perhaps the onlyJudiciary Committee Republican who might oppose confirmation, saidhe was convinced the nominee is ``conversant with the civil rightslaws'' and would be able to draw expertise from ``a battery ofattorneys available to him.''   President Bush is prepared to make personal telephone calls todrum up votes for Lucas, White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper saidtoday. ``The president ... has not made any phone calls, but hemay,'' if his involvement is seen as important, Cooper said.   The Judiciary Committee could vote as early as Thursday onwhether to recommend Lucas' confirmation to the full Senate. Thepanel is believed to be sharply split with a few undecidedlawmakers holding the balance.   The issue has become a political tug-of-war between the Bushadministration and a number of civil rights groups which opposeLucas, even though he is black, on grounds he lacks experience.   Specter told the Senate it ``has become a great American sportto use nominees as target practice in Washington, D.C..''   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., declared that ``themedia and the liberal establishment have stabbed Bill Lucas in theback'' and that ``frankly, it's a disgrace.''   ``Bill Lucas is a profile in courage _ what we are seeing withthe Bill Lucas nomination is a profile in liberal politics,'' Dolesaid.   Lucas, in written responses Tuesday to questions from JudiciaryCommittee members, stressed his commitment to civil rights but saidthere has not been enough time to assess recent Supreme Courtrulings on the issue.   ``I agree with the president and the attorney general that it isstill too early to assess the practical impact of these rulings,''Lucas said.   Lucas' answers on Tuesday followed his refusal at a committeehearing last week to criticize recent Supreme Court decisions thathave come under fire from civil rights groups.   However, Lucas said, ``I will not tolerate the misuse of any lawor court decision to deny rights guaranteed by this nation's civilrights laws.''   Lucas' promise to fight misuse of court decisions came in answerto Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who is believed to be leaning infavor of confirmation. The senator cited two recent civil rightsdecisions by the Supreme Court, City of Richmond vs. J.A. Crosonand Patterson vs. McLean.   The first case overturned automatic municipal contractset-asides for minority-owned firms without some finding ofprevious discrimination, and the second forbade the use of an 1866civil rights law to sue over alleged racial harassment on the job.   ``I believe these cases have erred in upsetting the properbalance between private actions and government enforcementactions,'' DeConcini said in asking what Lucas would do to enforcecivil rights law.   ``The attorney general and I recognize that some people may infact use the recent Supreme Court decisions in an attempt todiscriminate or to challenge legitimate affirmative action andset-aside programs,'' Lucas said.   ``It is my commitment to investigate and prosecute thoseindividuals or entities and to prevent such efforts to roll backthe hard-earned gains of the civil rights movement,'' he said.   Lucas said he would ``lead the charge in obtaining appropriaterelief'' for anyone who suffers discrimination as a result of therulings.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, asked whether Lucas believedaffirmative action laws have aided blacks and whether he thoughtsuch policies could result in tokenism or reverse discrimination.   ``I feel a special obligation to enforce laws which havebenefited me,'' Lucas said.   ``Where you have a persistent pattern of discrimination, I thinkthat it is entirely appropriate to order that minorities be hiredand promoted,'' he said. He added that he also approved ofvoluntary affirmative action efforts by employers ``to overcome amanifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job category.''   ``On the other hand, I think there is a danger that someprograms, under the label of affirmative action, can in certaincases be implemented in a way that amounts to improper quotahiring,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
