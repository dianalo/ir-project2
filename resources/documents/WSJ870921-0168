Terms weren't disclosed.    Bombardier is a maker of mass-transit equipment, aircraft and snowmobiles. Transit America, which recently stopped making passenger rail cars, was a division of Thyssen's Troy, Mich.-based Budd Co. until becoming a separate Thyssen unit in 1985. Transit America officials weren't available for comment.    Raymond Royer, president of Bombardier's transportation equipment group, said the purchase includes designs for more than 100 different rail car models, 10 of which are current, plus specialized tooling, equipment and drawings. It doesn't include any manufacturing facilities.    Bombardier said it will maintain a technical team of 20 to 30 people in Philadelphia to manage the design technology, international licenses and certain warranty operations.    Last year, Bombardier acquired the rail car designs of Pullman Co. from Pullman-Peabody Co. of Chicago.    Mr. Royer said Bombardier now owns designs for 85% of the subway, commuter and intercity rail car fleet in the U.S. &quot;It opens the door to some transit authorities where we couldn't bid because we didn't have the designs,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
