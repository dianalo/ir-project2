U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot to death during thehijacking that began on June 14, 1985, on a flight from Athens toRome, and ended up in Beirut. Thirty-nine Americans were heldcaptive for 17 days in the ordeal.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was indicted in the UnitedStates on air piracy and murder charges related to the act.   West Germany turned down a U.S. extradition request last year,but after two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut by thedefendant's brother, West Germany said he would be tried here.   Hamadi was arrested in Frankfurt on Jan. 13, 1987, whilecarrying liquid explosives and false documents, and has been jailedin Frankfurt since then. He was charged by West German officials onFeb. 8 with air piracy, murder, illegal possession of explosivesand carrying a false passport.   On Jan. 17, 1987, West German businessman Rudolf Cordes waskidnapped in Beirut and three days later another West German,Alfred Schmidt also was abducted in Lebanon.   Hamadi's 29-year-old brother, Abbas, was arrested at Frankfurtairport Jan. 26, 1987 after arriving on a flight from Beirut. Hewas charged with kidnapping the two West Germans in an attempt towin freedom for his brother.   Abbas Hamadi was found guilty by a Duesseldorf court last monthin connection with kidnapping the two West Germans and sentenced to13 years in prison.   Schmidt was released in September in what his captors said was a``goodwill gesture,'' but Cordes remains a hostage.   Justice officials have decided to open the case against MohammedHamadi in juvenile court in July, Hesse state court spokesman FalkThomas said at a news conference. No exact starting date was givenfor the trial, which is expected to last several months.   The final decision to try Mohammed Hamadi before a juvenilecourt was made because his age at the time of the crime could notbe determined, he said.   Mohammed Hamadi first told West German authorities he was bornon June 13, 1964, but later he said he was two years younger.   Under West German law, an adolescent is described as betweenages 18 and 21, an adult 21 and older, and a juvenile as less than18. Juvenile courts also handle adolescent cases.   ``If he is found guilty and the court determines that he was 21at the time the crimes he is charged with actually began, themaximum sentence is life imprisonment,'' Thomas said.   A juvenile court may give a life sentence to an adolescent basedon a determination of personal maturity at the time a crime began,despite age, said Thomas.   He added, however, that the usual maximum sentence is between 10and 15 years in prison for an adolescent not judged as mature.</TEXT></DOC>
