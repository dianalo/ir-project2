The minimum rate will be set at 15%, meaning thatLuxembourg and Spain, which have rates of 12% on most items,will have to raise their rates. Germany, with a 14% rate, hasalready announced it will raise its rate to 15% in January.</LP><TEXT>   The ministers also agreed to fix a more common system ofexcise taxes that apply to whiskey, wine, cigarettes and fueloil. But details of the excise taxes still have to be workedout.   The accord means that after Dec. 31, 1992, nationalauthorities will no longer be able to use one of the mostcommon excuses for stopping people and goods when they crossborders: to see if proper taxes were paid on goods purchasedabroad.   Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner responsible fortax matters, has been struggling to win agreement among theEC countries for more than two years. She was ecstatic as shewalked out of an eight-hour meeting with ministers. &quot;It'svery, very good,&quot; Mrs. Scrivener said, adding later: &quot;We candefinitely say that the abolition of fiscal frontiers willtake place in January 1993.&quot;   Though two countries will have to raise their rates, theoverall impact of the agreement will be to push down VATrates in the Community as a whole, EC officials said. France,Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands all haverates significantly higher than the minimum, ranging from18.5% to 22%. In a barrier-free EC market after 1992, therewill be no constraints on EC citizens who want to travel to alower-tax country to shop for better deals. Thus the high-taxcountries will come under pressure to come closer to the 15%rate.   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont alsosaid he was pleased with the agreement. The U.K. untilrecently opposed any EC interference in tax matters andargued that harmonization of tax rates was unnecessary to thesingle market. The problem was one of principle, since theBritish VAT rate of 17.5% is already above the minimum.   British objections were overcome, however, by making a&quot;political agreement,&quot; rather a legally binding one. Thedistinction wasn't seen as important, since states will stillbe under pressure to keep their rates at 15%. Britain wouldnot have to change any tax rates, Mr. Lamont said, and itszero rates on children's clothes, food and books could bemaintained.   The other eleven countries eventually want to translatethe pact into a legally binding EC directive. At that time,they will face the same problem of getting Britain to agree,since tax matters require unanimity.</TEXT></DOC>
