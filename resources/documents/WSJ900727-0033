Corn futures prices also gained ground on rumors ofplanned Soviet purchases. Wheat futures prices lagged behind,closing only marginally higher.</LP><TEXT>   Futures analysts said Soviet plans to borrow $1 billionfrom the Swiss arm of De Beers, the South African miningconsortium, fueled rumors that a significant amount of thatmoney would go toward soybean and grain imports over the nextseveral months. The loan was coupled with the Soviets' planto sell $5 billion of diamonds through De Beers over the nextfive years.   Soybean futures for November delivery gained 10 cents abushel to close at $6.0925.   Reports in the Soviet media this week about millions oftons of grain going unharvested because of a lack of fuel forfarm equipment also supported soybean and corn futuresprices, analysts said.   December corn futures gained 2.75 cents a bushel to closeat $2.5875.   Domestic demand is buoying U.S. soybean futures prices aswell. Figures released Wednesday indicated that U.S. soybeanoil consumption last month was the fourth largest everreported for June, said Richard Loewy, president ofAgResource Co. in Chicago.   Yesterday's diamond-sparked rally may be just a flash inthe pan, warned one analyst. With prospects for a large U.S.soybean harvest undiminished, &quot;soybean futures are notsomething you want to own for the longer term,&quot; said MickeyLuth, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. inChicago.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with those ofgold and platinum easing while silver edged higher. Afterstronger gold price movements earlier in the week, tradingturned quieter yesterday. Indications that OPEC members willseek a crude oil price around $20 a barrel, and possibly ashigh as $22, was in line with traders' expectations. As aresult, precious metals prices weren't much affected, WilliamO'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch, said.&quot;That anticipated result is already in the market, and anyOPEC decision isn't expected to have any effect -- unless ofcourse there are some surprising developments,&quot; he said. Thedollar was mixed, which was about neutral for gold, Mr.O'Neill said. One interesting development, according to Mr.O'Neill, is that the Soviet Union appears to be getting itscredit house in order, as indicated by the reported $1billion loan that was collateralized by Soviet diamonds. &quot;Ifthis improvement continues, it will diminish some of theSoviet Union's urgency to sell precious metals, which wouldbe a long-term positive factor for the market,&quot; he said. Inplatinum, the fact that the dollar was slightly higheragainst the yen tended to soften Japanese demand for themetal, said Nina Lipton, research manager, Platinum GuildInternational, an industry group. Ms. Lipton said that whenthe dollar declines against the yen, the Japanese areinclined to buy platinum because it is cheaper in yen terms.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices rose. The September contract rose2.05 cents a pound to 90.85 cents, just 0.05 cent shy of theday's high. The contract traded in a range of slightly morethan two cents. Providing some support for the market wasuncertainty about the size of the 1990-91 coffee crop inBrazil, whose season began July 1, an analyst said. Brazil isthe world's biggest coffee producer. According to Sandra Kaulof Shearson Lehman Hutton, estimates of the harvest rangefrom 22 million to 33 million bags; a bag is 132 pounds. &quot;The11 million-bag difference between these estimates is equal tothe output of Colombia, the world's second-largest producer,&quot;Ms. Kaul said. &quot;It's unclear how much low prices that haveprevailed over the past year, since the International CoffeeAgreement quota and price clauses were suspended in July1989, have affected the care of the coffee trees. Also,recent rains may have had an impact on the quality of therecently harvested Brazilian coffee being dried.&quot; A recentBrazilian government decision to pay farmers from the coffeedevelopment fund has tempered the farmers' urgency to sellcoffee, and many are withholding the beans, which hasinfluenced prices, Ms. Kaul said.</TEXT></DOC>
