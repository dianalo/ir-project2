The charges were made last February and had implications far beyond Hawkeye, a troubled Iowa farm lender, for bank holding companies that own troubled banks.    In a letter sent to Hawkeye last week, according to banking officials who declined to be named, the Fed said it was dropping the charges that had grown out of the failure last February of State Bank of Allison, Iowa. Hawkeye, which owned the bank, had let it fail rather than infuse $1.2 million in fresh capital that regulators said the bank needed.    At the time, Hawkeye was in the midst of the debt restructuring that it asserted required all of its available funds.    Had the restructuring of Hawkeye's $100 million in debt not gone through, the company had said it would file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate with protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debt. Such a move could have undermined depositors' confidence in Hawkeye and the cost to regulators could have been many time larger than the failure of the Allison bank.    Hawkeye had been in default on the debt for some time. The recently completed restructuring converted much of its debt to equity and helped Hawkeye to post a first-quarter profit of $8.8 million, or 83 cents a share, following several quarters of big losses that had almost wiped out its pre-restructuring capital.    According to the banking officials, the Fed didn't say explicitly in its letter, dated April 24, why it dropped the charges. Even after the Allison bank failed and was sold to another bank, the Fed had wanted Hawkeye to come up with the $1.2 million; a hearing on the matter was scheduled for Monday in Washington. However, it appeared that the Fed realized that forcing Hawkeye to make the payment, and potentially derailing its hard-won debt restructuring, could have turned out to be a painfully expensive precedent.    A Fed spokesman refused to comment on any aspect of the Hawkeye matter.    Robert Murray, an executive vice president of Hawkeye, confirmed yesterday that the charges had been dropped and the hearing canceled, but he wouldn't elaborate.    The same day that the Fed dropped its charges, it issued a statement reiterating that bank holding companies should be a source of strength to the banks they own. The issue could arise again soon as banking regulators deal with some troubled bank holding companies in the Southwest.    There, as at Hawkeye, the Fed wants creditors who lent money to the holding companies to stand in line for repayment behind the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits and bears the cost of bank failures. </TEXT></DOC>
