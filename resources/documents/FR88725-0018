L. 91-373) (the ``EUCA''), 26U.S.C. 3304 note. That Act prescribes provisions required to be includedin State unemployment compensation laws. It is made a requirement for Statelaws by section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Actwas amended in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983 to change the requirements forState laws in a number of ways.<ITAG tagnum="84">1980 Amendments to EUCA </ITAG>Section 416 of Pub. L. 96-364 added section 202(c) to the EUCA, and barsmore than 2 weeks of Extended Benefit payments to individuals under theInterstate Benefit Payment Plan if they file claims in a State where anExtended Benefit Period is not in effect. This amendment was effectiveon June 1, 1981, in most States. Section 1022 of Pub. L. 96-499 amended section 204(a)(2) of the EUCA toadd a new subparagraph (B) which limits Federal reimbursement of benefitsto a State which does not require a waiting period for regular benefits.Section 615.14(c)(3) establishes the effective dates under varying Statecircumstances. This amendment affects a State's entitlement to Federalsharing in the costs of regular compensation and Extended Benefits, butis not a requirement for State laws. Section 1024 of Pub. L. 96-499 added sections 202(a) (3), (4) and (5) ofthe EUCA. Paragraph (3) requires amendment of State laws to include specificprovisions defining suitable work as any work which is within an individual'scapabilities, except that if the individual's prospects of obtaining workin his/her customary occupation in a reasonably short period are determinedto be good, then suitable work is determined under the provisions in Statelaw applicable to claimants for regular benefits; and includes a specificdisqualification for failure to accept suitable work, or to apply for suitablework when referred by a State employment office, or to actively searchfor work. Paragraph (4) requires that disqualifications for voluntarilyleaving employment, discharge for misconduct and refusal of suitable workshall not be considered terminated for the purpose of qualifying for ExtendedBenefits except by employment subsequent to the disqualifications. Paragraph(5) (redesignated as (6) in the 1981 amendments, which added a new paragraph(5)) prohibits Federal sharing in regular benefit costs if the State doesnot apply the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4) in paying such benefits.Paragraphs (3) and (4) are requirements for State laws; paragraph (5),like section 204(a)(2), is not a requirement for State laws. The requirementsof paragraph 4 took effect in all States for weeks of unemployment beginningafter March 31, 1981. The requirements in paragraph 3 took effect in theStates for weeks of unemployment beginning after October 31, 1981, exceptfor any State in which the State legislature did not meet in 1981, section202(a)(3) shall apply to weeks of unemployment beginning after October1, 1982. <ITAG tagnum="84">1981 Amendments to EUCA </ITAG>Sections 2401 through 2404 and sections 2505 and 2506 of Pub. L. 97-35made several changes in the conditions under which Extended Benefits triggeron or off by eliminating the National trigger, changing the standard Statetrigger from 4.0 percent to 5.0 percent, the optional State trigger from5.0 percent to 6.0 percent, and changing the definition of the ``rate ofinsured unemployment'' by eliminating claims for Extended Benefits andadditional compensation. Other amendments prohibit paying benefits to individualswith little qualifying employment, and make changes to tie into the amendmentsto the Trade Act of 1974. Changes in andSection;andSection; 615.2, 615.4, 615.7,615.8, 615.12, 615.13, and 615.14 reflect those amendments. <ITAG tagnum="84">1982 Amendment to EUCA </ITAG>Section 191 of Pub. L. 97-248 amended section 204(a)(2) to add a new subparagraph(D), which provides that States which do not provide for a benefit structureunder which benefits are rounded down to the next lower dollar amount shallnot be entitled to be reimbursed for the Federal 50 percent share on theamount by which sharable regular and sharable extended compensation paidexceed the lower dollar amount. This amendment became effective for benefitspaid for eligibility periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983, witha grace period for States that require legislation to provide for roundingdown. <ITAG tagnum="84">1983 Amendment to EUCA </ITAG>Section 522 of Pub. L. 98-21 amended section 202(a)(3)(A)(ii) to provideexemptions to the requirement that claimants actively engage in seekingwork: (1) if the individual is serving on jury duty under specified circumstances,and (2) if the individual is hospitalized for an emergency or life-threateningcondition. A State may apply these exemptions to claimants for ExtendedBenefits only if the exemptions also apply to claimants for regular benefits.Sections 615.2(o) (11) and (12) define the terms ``jury duty'' and ``hospitalizedfor treatment of an emergency or life-threatening condition.'' The amendmentto section 202(a)(3)(A)(ii) became effective on enactment, April 20, 1983.<ITAG tagnum="84">1987 Amendment to EUCA </ITAG>Section 9151 of Pub. L. 100-203 amended the date in section 202(a)(6) forpurposes of determining the Federal share of weeks of unemployment beginnningafter March 31, 1981. Section 9151 of Pub. L. 100-203 changed the originaleffective date of section 202(a)(3) to weeks of unemployment beginningafter October 31, 1981. If a State's legislature did not meet in 1981,section 202(a)(3), EUCA would apply to weeks of unemployment beginningafter October 31, 1982.Invitation for Comments The proposal to revise the Extended Benefits (EB) regulations was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 24, 1986 (51 FR 37741). Comments onthe proposed revision of Part 615 were originally solicited through November24, 1986. On April 3, 1987 (52 FR 10774) a notice was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>extending the closing date for comments to April20, 1987. The Department of Labor received timely written responses to the proposalfrom 15 State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs) and the Building andConstruction Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor_Congressof Industrial Organizations. The SESAs that commented on the proposal were:The Arizona Department of Economic Security, the California EmploymentDevelopment Department, the Illinois Department of Employment Security,the Michigan Employment Security Commission, the Nevada Employment SecurityDepartment, the New Jersey Department of Labor, the New York Departmentof Labor, the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services, the Oregon EmploymentDivision of the Department of Human Resources, the Pennsylvania Departmentof Labor and Industry, Office of Employment Security, the Tennessee Departmentof Employment Security, the Texas Employment Commission, the Vermont Departmentfor Employment and Training, the West Virginia Department of EmploymentSecurity, and the Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations.The Department gave careful consideration to all comments and suggestedchanges received before drafting the final regulations. This document containsthe final revised regulations for Part 615. Following is a summary of thecomments received and the Department's responses in order of section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis and Response to Comments Received </ITAG>General A SESA commented that it believed the regulations were of sufficient importanceto warrant a public hearing. The Secretary agrees on the importance ofthese regulations. However, the Assistant Secretary has determined thatthe process of publishing the proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, was sufficientto satisfy the statutory requirement for public participation in this rulemaking.The notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>gave interested persons an opportunity to participatein the rulemaking through submission of written data, views or arguments,allowed more than 30 days for such comments, and was followed by the Department'scareful consideration of the written comments received. A public hearingfor these regulations is not required by statute. For these reasons, theDepartment will schedule no public hearing. A SESA commented that some States are currently pursuing administrativerelief from findings of the Inspector General, which, it believes, involveissues of interpretation of State and Federal law at the same time thatState program decisions were made. It stated that to now deny payment ofthe Federal share of Extended Benefits, under the circumstances set forthin andSection; 615.14(b) of these regulations, would be impermissably retroactiverulemaking. These regulations are not retroactive in application but rather implementthe provisions of the EUCA amendments as of their effective dates. Accordingly,each of the amendments addressed in these revised regulations, includingthe changes in andSection; 615.14(b), is treated as having become effectiveon the effective dates specified in the amending acts. The Department hasbeen carrying out the law as amended. The regulations affirm this and nowfurnish a regulatory basis for the positions that have been taken in implementingthe statutory amendments.The SESA further commented that five years is too lengthy a period betweenstatutory enactment and rulemaking and after five years of ``ever-changingdirectives,'' the proposed rules no longer provide timely clarification.These comments on the timing of the publication of the proposed rules areunderstandable; however, the EUCA was amended in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983and each amendment required revisions and additions to the proposed rules.Part of the delay in the publication of these regulations is inherent inthe regulatory process. This process is governed by the AdministrativeProcedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12067 and12291, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. These directives also require theOffice of Management and Budget to review regulatory proposals. Althoughthese processes concededly do not explain away all of the delays encountered,and there have been changes in guidance furnished to the States, the lastsubstantive changes were reflected in the Notice of Proposed Rulemakingpublished on October 24, 1986. The States were, therefore, timely notifiedof each amendment and each change in guidance. The SESA listed several examples of ``ever-changing directives'' from ETAwhich, it stated, placed SESAs in the position of constantly modifyingadministrative policies. It noted that Unemployment Insurance Program Letter(UIPL) 14-81, issued February 2, 1981, stated that if a claimant was unavailablefor work in any week because of illness, disability, death in the family,or jury duty, the claimant would not be excused from meeting the activelyseeking work requirement of EUCA section 202(a)(3). The SESA believed thatthis was inconsistent with the explanation for the definition of ``weeksof unemployment'' in andSection; 615.2(n)(2) of the regulations, which statedCongress must not have intended EUCA section 202(a)(3) to disqualify aclaimant who was not claiming benefits for a given week due to illness.The statements in the UIPL and the regulations are not inconsistent. Itis still true that, except as modified by the 1983 amendments, no excusewill suffice for failing to meet the actively seeking work requirementof section 202(a)(3)(A), EUCA. It also remains true that the requirementapplies only to weeks for which a claim is filed for benefits. This interpretationavoids the extreme result of requiring the disqualification to apply toevery week of unemployment regardless of whether a claim is filed. The1983 amendment to EUCA section 202(a)(3)(A) softens the actively seekingwork requirement, but does not change the basic approach the Departmenttakes of applying the disqualification only with respect to weeks for whicha claim is filed. The Department's guidance to the States on these pointshas remained unchanged, except as required by the 1983 amendments. No changeis made in the regulations. The SESA further commented that UIPL 14-81, Change 2, issued September8, 1981, stated that a maximum of 4 weeks for a claimant to obtain workwithin the individual's customary occupation would constitute ``a reasonablyshort period'' under EUCA section 202(a)(3)(C). The commenter noted thatunder the proposed regulations, andSection; 615.8(d)(1), the determinationof the length of this ``reasonably shortperiod'' is now left to the applicableState law. This change represents a deferral to the States; the States were timelynotified when this change was made. The Department prefers to leave mattersto the States where it can do so under the law. In this instance the Departmentdecided, after reconsidering the matter, that this was a matter betterleft to the States. No change is made in the regulation. This SESA also commented that andSection; 615.2(o)(7) of the proposed regulations,defining the phrase ``Provisions of the applicable State law,'' as usedin section 202(a)(3)(D)(iii) of the Act, changes the UIPL instructions.The SESA states that this change ``would substantively amend [the] statutoryinterpretation after years of denial of claims based on [the] more restrictiveUIPL instructions.'' The change made by the proposed regulations defining the phrase, ``Provisionsof the applicable State law,'' as used in section 202(a)(3)(D)(iii) ofthe Act defers to the States. The Department acknowledges that it has changedits interpretation of the phrase, ``Provisions of applicable State law,''because the Department, as explained above, prefers to leave matters tothe States where it can do so under the law. Upon reconsideration, theDepartment has decided that it was proper to defer to the States here.No change is made in the regulation. The SESA also commented that misleading legal conclusions are drawn inthe ``<T2>SUMMARY</T2>,'' ``<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>,'' and ``1980 Amendments to EUCA'' sections.With respect to the ``<T2>SUMMARY</T2>'', it stated that there had been no regulations on thenew paragraphs added to section 202(a), EUCA, enacted by Pub. L. 96-499;therefore, there are no regulations on these new paragraphs to be revisedby the Proposed Rules. The proposed rule added new text in addition to amending existing text;both kinds of changes come under the definition of a ``revision'' of theregulations. This omission of a reference to the added text was not anattempt to mislead, but is noted in the final regulations. The changesproposed were carefully noted in the preamble and fully set forth in theregulatory text of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.The SESA also commented that the ``Supplementary Information'' and the``1980 Amendments to EUCA'' section are misleading because the amendmentsin Pub. L. 96-499 that added new paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) to EUCA section202(a) did not require States to change State law. The SESA commented thatCongress clearly intended that State law be changed at section 1022(a)of Pub. L. 96-499, which concerns the waiting week and that no such languageis found in the statute concerning suitable work. The Department used the word ``required'' in the Supplementary Informationwith respect to the amendments in Pub. L. 96-499 that added new paragraphsto section 202(a) of EUCA, because it is bound by the use of the word ``required''in section 3304(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">On October 31 of any taxable year, the Secretary of Labor shall notcertify any State which, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearingto the State agency, the Secretary of Labor finds has failed to amend itslaw so that it contains each of the provisions required by law to be includedtherein (including provisions relating to the Federal-State Extended UnemploymentCompensation Act of 1970 (or any amendments thereto) as provided undersubsection (a)(11)), or has, with respect to the twelve-month period endingon such October 31, failed to comply substantially with any such provision.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Paragraphs (3) and (4) were correctly stated to be new requirementsfor Extended Benefits, as are other provisions of EUCA sections 202 and203 relating to eligibility requirements for Extended Benefits. Paragraph(5) was correctly noted as not being a requirement for State laws, butsolely a requirement for Federal sharing in the costs of regular benefits.The absence of identical language in the suitable work provisions is notdeterminative. Therefore, ``required'' is not deleted from the <T2>Supplementary Information </T2>in the final regulations, and no changeis made in the final regulations. The SESA also commented that the Proposed Rules should be classified asmajor rules and a regulatory impact analysis must be prepared. The Secretary of Labor has determined, with the concurrence of the Officeof Management and Budget, that the proposed rules are not major rules,for the reasons stated in the document. Section 615.2(o)(1) ``Employed'' The proposed rule at andSection; 615.2(o)(1) defines ``employed'' for purposesof section 202(a)(3) of EUCA. A SESA, that did not suggest alternate language,commented that this definition does not meet the expressed goal of excluding``such neighborly exchanges as babysitting.''The Department's definition of ``employed'' was written to prevent thepurging of a disqualification by activity that is not bona fide employmentor by services not customarily performed under a contract of hire for wages.The definition at andSection; 615.2(o)(1) thus provides that the definitionof employment in State law applies. Therefore, a SESA should refer to Statelaw for purposes of determining what ``employed'' means in applying the4x4 disqualification and in determining what ``employment'' suffices underthe EUCA section 202(a)(4) requirement. For these reasons, the definitionof ``employed'' at andSection; 615.2(o)(1) will remain unchanged in the finalregulations. Section 615.2(o)(4) ``Reasonably short period'' The proposed rule at andSection; 615.2(o)(4) defines a ``reasonably shortperiod'', for purposes of section 202(a)(3)(C) of the Act, as the numberof weeks specified by State law. A SESA commented that the regulation shouldexplain whether a State's policy regarding a reasonably short period maybe followed in the absence a State law provision which defines a reasonablyshort period. This is a matter of interpretation of State law for State authorities todecide. This definition could be read, however, as requiring specificityin the State law, and this is not what is intended. In the final regulation,therefore, the word ``specified'' is deleted and the word ``provided''is inserted in place thereof. Section 615.2(o)(6) ``And'' as used in section 202(a)(3)(D)(ii), shallbe interpreted to mean ``or'' The proposed rule at 615.2(o)(6) defines ``and'' to mean ``or'' with respectto the provision that ``Extended compensation shall not be denied * * *for failing to accept an offer of, or apply for, suitable work * * * ifthe position was not offered to such individual in writing and was notlisted with the State employment service * * *.'' Three SESAs commentedon the interpretation of ``and'' to mean ``or'' with one SESA assertingthat this interpretation goes beyond the law and that a regulation cannotcontradict the statute it implements. Another SESA suggested applicationof the more stringent suitable work definition in State laws for regularbenefits to Extended Benefits claims and removal of the limitation on denialsof Extended Benefits when an individual refuses to accept an offer of suitablework if the offer of work is not made in writing and is not listed withthe State employment service. The Department originally construed ``and'' in section 202(a)(3)(D)(ii)of the Act in the conjunctive as requiring that both conditions be satisfiedbefore imposing the disqualification. That is, an individual who refusedan offer of otherwise suitable work could be denied extended benefits onlyif the offered work was both listed with the State employment service <T3>and </T3>offered in writing. However, early in 1981 the Departmentconcluded that ``and'' must be construed as ``or'' in this instance, sothat either an offer in writing or the listing with the employment servicewould suffice. This view is supported both by the explanation in ConferenceReport No. 96-1479: ``(b)(1) Deny extended benefits to any individual whofails to accept any work that is offered in writing or is listed with theState employment service * * *.'' and the Senate Finance Committee Print96-36. It is apparent that the word ``and'' so construed provides for a more reasonableand rational requirement. In practice an offer of a job is rarely madein writing and it is unheard of to make an offer of a job prior to a referral.Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect or require an advance offer inwriting, especially in the case of a referral. It is also obvious thatrequiring that the offer be in writing <T3>and</T3> listed with the employment service makes it more difficultto impose the disqualification under the EB ``work test'' than is the caseunder State law applicable to regular benefits. Congressional intent wasto impose a more stringent requirement than provided under current Statelaw disqualifications. Clearly that intent is not realized by construingthe word ``and'' in the conjunctive and thereby requiring both of the conditionscontained in subparagraph (D)(ii) be satisfied to justify imposition ofthe special disqualification. In light of these considerations and to determine what action could legallybe taken to achieve congressional intent, the Department examined the legislativehistory of this provision and pertinent court decisions to resolve theapparent conflict between the language in the report and the language ofthe statute. The Department determined that there is sufficient legal precedentin court decisions that the word ``and'' in a statute may indeed be construedas ``or'' (and vice versa) where that is necessary to carry out the legislativeintent. Accordingly, based on the holdings in those court decisions, thethrust of the legislation, and the expressed legislative intent, the Departmentconcluded that the word ``and'' must be construed as ``or''. Thereforea State law will be considered consistent with the requirements of subparagraph(D)(ii) only if it provides that a disqualification for failing to acceptan offer of or apply for suitable work will be imposed if the job is eitheroffered in writing or is listed with the State employment service, and,conversely, that the disqualification will not apply if the job is neitheroffered in writing nor listed with the State employment service. The suggestion to apply the more stringent suitable work definitions inState laws for regular benefits to Extended Benefit claims and to ``remove''the (D)(ii) provision from the regulations, is not acceptable because itwould be contrary to sections 202(a) (2) and (3) of EUCA. Paragraph (2)of section 202(a) of EUCA provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the termsand conditions of State law which apply to claims for regular compensation* * * shall apply to claims for extended compensation * * *</ITAG>Paragraph (3)(A) of section 202(a) of EUCA provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), payment of extendedcompensation under this Act shall not be made to any individual for anyweek of unemployment in his eligibility period_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) during which he fails to accept any offer of suitable work (asdefined in subparagraph (c)) * * *.</ITAG>The applicability of the suitable work provisions of the EUCA is indicatedby the phrase, ``Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2)'', inparagraph (3)(A) of section 202(a) of the ACT. Thus paragraph (3)(A) specificallyprovides that, without prevention by or obstruction from paragraph (2),the suitable work and active search for work provisions in the EUCA shallapply to claims for extended compensation. For these reasons, no changeis made in the final regulations. Section 615.2(o)(8) Systematic and Sustained Effort (to obtain work) The proposed rule at andSection; 615.2(o)(8) defines the term ``systematicand sustained effort'' set forth in section 202(a)(3)(E) of the EUCA todescribe when an individual shall be treated as actively engaged in seekingwork during any week. Five SESAs commented on the active search for workrequirements. Two SESAs' comments suggested that the required work searchbe consistent with economic conditions in the labor market, prospectivejob openings, seasonal nature of the work being sought and the normal practicesfor obtaining the type of work the individual is seeking. One of the SESAscommented that the active search for work requirement should be waived(as it is in State law for regular unemployment compensation) for individualsthe State determines to have ``good'' job prospects; that is, individualswho have a promise of a job which will begin in a reasonably short period.One of the SESAs suggested that a State administrator be allowed to makean exception to the active search for work requirement for a communityor area which has been so adversely affected by the economy that thereis virtually no work available. Comments from two of the SESAs questionedif the phrase ``throughout the given week'' (which defines the term ``sustainedeffort'' to obtain work) included weekends and holidays and questionedthe absence of specifics in the definition regarding job search contacts(number of employer contacts required throughout the week). This conflictswith the State's more quantifiable active search for work requirements.A SESA suggested that the definition of the work search requirements atandSection; 615.2(o)(8) be used in conjunction with the criteria for theactive search for work as defined in State law and policy. One of the SESA'scommented that the requirement that a claimant's search for work includea plan which results in contact with persons who have ``the authority tohire'' is impractical and impossible to administer. The Department has not adopted the changes proposed by the commenter forthe reasons which follow. The Congress added the active search for workprovisions to the EUCA with the knowledge that Extended Benefits are payableonly during periods of high unemployment when new hires and job openingsare at a low level in the States. Therefore, it would be contrary to congressionalintent and the specific language in sections 202(a)(3) (A) and (E), EUCA,to authorize by regulation limiting the enforcement of the active searchfor work provisions to periods when an area is not adversely affected byeconomic conditions as suggested. A State's policy for regular compensation, at the discretion of the StateAdministrator, may require an individual to seek any work that exists inthe labor market for which he/she is suited by training and experienceif his/her customary work does not exist in the labor market. Similarly,a State's policy for regular benefits may consider the seasonal natureof the individual's customary occupation in determining if the claimantis conducting an active search for work or waive the active search forwork requirement for individuals who are on temporary layoffs or who haveearly return to work dates. On the other hand, based on examination of the Congressional Record S8917,June 30, 1980, and the language in section 202(a)(3) (C) and (E), EUCA,``suitable work'' for an individual whose prospects of obtaining work ina customary occupation in a reasonably short period are determined by theSESA to be ``not good'' is any work which is within such individual's capabilities.The EUCA makes no exception to this definition of suitable work becausethe unemployed person's customary employment is seasonal. This means anindividual whose job prospects have been determined to be ``not good''may not limit the search for work solely because of the seasonal natureof his/her customary employment. An individual whose job prospects are``not good'' because of the seasonal nature of the industry or occupationmust seek any work that exists in the labor market which is within theclaimant's capabilities, which also includes work for which the individualmay have had no previous training or experience. The proposed regulations, andSection; 615.8, paragraphs (d), (f) and (g),relate the definition of suitable work, based on the SESA's determinationof the individual's prospects of obtaining work in a customary occupationin a reasonably short period, to the requirement of a ``systematic andsustained'' search for work as provided in section 202(a)(3)(A)(ii) and(E) of EUCA. For these reasons, no change is made to andSection; 615.2(o)(8)in the final regulations to authorize waiving or limiting the active searchfor work requirement because of the seasonal nature of the individual'scustomary employment, prospective job openings, adverse economic conditionsor normal practices in obtaining work the claimant may be seeking. The phrase ``throughout the given week'' defines ``sustained effort toobtain work during such week''. ``Throughout the given week'' means a searchfor work maintained throughout the work week prevailing or customary inthe labor market area for the particular type of work being sought. Thisis based on the plain meaning of the words ``systematic and sustained''.Section 615.2(o)(8) derives from section 202(a)(3) (A) and (E) of the EUCAand provides for implementation of these provisions consistent with congressionalintent as expressed in the Congressional Record (S8935-6, June 30, 1980);that is, ``* * * to limit access to the extended benefit program * * *to individuals * * * who have made every effort to return to work * * *.''It is the Department of Labor's position that to administer the systematicand sustained effort to obtain work provision set forth in section 202(a)(3)(E)of EUCA means that each State employment security agency (SESA) must developcriteria for a systematic and sustained search for work for the variouslabor market areas within the State. These criteria must be based on labormarket information (LMI), in particular, the number of employers in a labormarket area, and whenever possible developed in consultation with LMI specialists.These criteria must be expressed in the number of days ``throughout thegiven week'' the individuals are required to search for ``suitable work''as well as the number of contacts with prospective employers individualsshall be required to make during a week to maintain their eligibility forextended benefits. The development of guidelines and criteria for a systematicand sustained search are necessary to assure the even-handed applicationof the active search for work requirement to all similarly situated claimants(same labor market area and job prospects classifications) subject to thisrequirement. The guidelines are also necessary for each State's monitoringof claimants' active search for work for the purpose of detecting noncomplianceas part of the processing of weeks claimed for payments. It is the responsibility of the SESAs to administer the active search forwork provisions in State law as required by the EUCA. Each State is bestqualified to assess the characteristics of its local labor markets basedon LMI specific to the local areas within the State and to establish guidelinesfor the required active search for work. Therefore, it would be inappropriatefor the Department to take over the States' responsibility for administeringthe EB active search for work and impose by regulation specific, quantifiable,nationwide work search requirements based on the characteristics of locallabor markets. The States' methods of administering the active search forwork requirements are best expressed in the number of days during the givenweek an individual shall search for work and the number of employer contacts(``more quantifiable'') an individual must make during such week. Suchcriteria are essential for monitoring claimants' active search for workand for enforcing the EB active search for work requirements in State law.The States' criteria for a systematic and sustained search for work areconsistent with andSection; 615.2(o)(8) of these regulations if the criteriaprovide for a high level of job search activity sustained throughout thegiven week based on the number of employers in the particular labor marketarea. The Department agrees, however, that it is not consistent with thesection 202(a)(3) work test, regardless whether the claimants' job prospectsare classified as ``good'' or ``not good'', to require claimants to searchfor types of work which they may not be required to accept. The final ruleis clarified to reflect this. Regarding ``contacts with persons who have the authority to hire'' in andSection;615.2(o)(8)(ii), the Department acknowledges that it is possible for aperson to make a planned, systematic effort to obtain work and yet notmake contact with the person who has the authority to hire. Accordingly,the phrase ``contacts with persons who have the authority to hire'' inthe regulation is modified to also include applying for work by ``whateverhiring procedure is required by a prospective employer.''

It contends thatsuch State laws violate the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitutionby improperly interfering with national policy embodied in the NationalLabor Relations Act of the right of full freedom of association throughunion membership. In addition, the labor organization contends that theDepartment's deference to State law and policy with regard to this issue,as embodied in the proposed rules, is also inconsistent with the unionmembers' freedom of association guaranteed by the National Labor RelationsAct. Accordingly, the Building and Construction Trades Department recommendedthat proposed andSection; 615.2(o)(8) be modified to provide expressly thata ``systematic and sustained effort'' to look for suitable work, as requiredby section 202(a)(3)(E) of EUCA, is satisfied if the individual falls withinthe category of workers who secure employment through the efforts of aunion hiring hall established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.The Building and Construction Trades Department objected to andSection; 615.8(e)of the proposed rule because it does not list nonunion work as work thatis not suitable when an individual's job prospects have been determinedto be ``not good.''The Congress amended (Pub. L. 96-499) the Federal-State Extended UnemploymentCompensation Act of 1970 to require that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * as a condition of eligibility for extended unemployment benefits,the unemployed individual must be willing at that point to accept any jobwhich meets minimum standards of acceptability (such as basic health andsafety standards, compliance with Federal minimum wage and other existingFederal standards) * * *.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Congressional Record S8917, June 30, 1980.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Under the amended Act, ``suitable work'' for any individual claimingextended benefits whose prospects of obtaining work in his/her customaryoccupation in a reasonably short period are not good, is any work thatdoes not exceed the individual's physical and mental abilities.The amendments to the Act also provide in subparagraph (A) that paymentof extended compensation shall not be made to any individual for any weekof unemployment_``(ii) during which he fails to actively engage in seeking work.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">As provided in subparagraph (E) the individual shall be treated asactively engaged in seeking work during any week if_<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) the individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained effortto obtain work during such week, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the individual provides tangible evidence to the State agencythat he has engaged in such an effort during such week.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The broadening of the definition of ``suitable work'' to include workin addition to that at the individual's higher skills or customary workis designed to increase the range of jobs individuals must seek and acceptand to increase the prospects of reemployment of individuals who had beenunemployed for extended periods of time. The intent of Congress in amendingthe Act was ``to limit access to the extended benefit program * * * toindividuals who have demonstrated a reasonable attachment to the work force,lost their jobs involuntarily, and made every effort to return to work.''Congressional Record S8935, June 30, 1980.The Department's position on a ``systematic and sustained effort'' to obtainwork as expressed in andSection; 615.2(o)(8) of the proposed rules is basedon the language in section 202(a)(3)(E), EUCA, and examination of the CongressionalRecord S8917, S8935, June 30, 1980. The active search for work and thesuitable work provisions added to EUCA by the Omnibus Reconciliation Actof 1980 were designed to reduce benefit costs by targeting the paymentof Extended Benefits to those individuals who are willing to apply forand accept suitable work which does not fully match the individual's higherskills and earnings levels and who increase their efforts to find any workwithin their capabilities.Therefore, based on the plain meaning of the words, a ``systematic andsustained effort'' to obtain work, the proposed rules define this requirementas a planned, methodical search conducted throughout each week claimed.It is a search for work not limited to a single method of finding worksuch as reporting to a union hiring hall or the State job service office.It is a search for work not limited to classes of work or rates of paywhich represent the individual's higher skills or customary work exceptwhere the State classifies the individual as having good prospects of findingwork in his/her customary occupation in a reasonably short period. Underthe proposed rules registering for work at a union hiring hall is consideredto be the same as any other single effort to obtain work, such as answeringa help wanted advertisement in a newspaper, and of itself is not evidenceof a systematic and sustained search for work.Instructions to an individual to increase his/her efforts to find workand to engage in a ``sustained'' search for work solely through a unionhiring hall serve no purpose when union members are dispatched to jobsaccording to seniority or length of unemployment. Under this referral system,those union members who have the earliest registration for work or thegreater seniority will be the first dispatched to jobs regardless of dailyreporting to the union hiring hall or requests from union members withless seniority for referrals to work outside the usual order.The language in andSection; 615.2(o)(8) of the proposed rule implements theplain meaning of the words in section 202(a)(3)(E); i.e., ``the individualhas engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work''. Thislanguage defines the requirement that individuals actively engage in asearch for work as is specifically required by section 202(a)(3)(A)(ii).This means that the individual must do more than be passively availablefor work or that the individual only stands ready to work if work is offeredas would be the case if the individual limited the search for work to registeringfor work with the union or the State job service office.Therefore, neither registration at a union hiring hall nor registrationfor work with the State job service office of itself fulfills the requirementof section 202(a)(3)(E); i.e., ``engaged in a systematic and sustainedeffort to obtain work during such week * * * .'' The exception to thisrule with respect to the union hiring hall is while the individual hasbeen classified by the State as having ``good'' prospects of obtainingwork in her/his customary occupation in a reasonably short period. Thisexception means the individual's registration at a union hiring hall maybe considered to fulfill the requirement for a systematic and sustainedeffort to obtain work during such week provided such individual normallyobtains customary work through the hiring hall and only if under the State'slaw applicable to regular compensation such individuals are permitted tolimit their search for work to registering for work at the union hiringhall. Subclauses (I) and (II) of section 202(a)(3)(ii) of the EUCA conveythe only other limitations to the requirement of a ``systematic and sustainedeffort'' to obtain work during each week for which sharable compensationis claimed.The Department believes that the question of supremacy of Federal law iswithout relevance to the proposed rules for the Extended Benefits Programbecause Congress has made State laws the vehicle for implementing Federalpolicies. This is the case with respect to the Federal-State Extended UnemploymentCompensation Act of 1970 because the States are required to include theprovisions of EUCA in State laws.The proposed rules for Extended Benefits do not prevent or curtail unionmembers' right of freedom of association. The labor standards in section3304(a)(5), IRC, are applicable to the suitable work provisions in section202(a)(3) of EUCA. The Department has never taken the position that requiringunemployed union workers to accept offers of nonunion work in their customaryoccupations would, in itself, violate the labor standards even where acceptanceof the nonunion work in their customary occupations would violate the bylawsand constitution of the labor organization. This is an area that has beenleft to the States to determine under their laws. Thus, it is a matterof State law whether members of labor organizations are subject to denialof Extended Benefits for failing to apply for or accept nonunion work intheir customary occupations. This is a continuation of the position takenby the Social Security Board early in the Federal-State unemployment compensationprogram and followed by its successors, including the Department of Labor.The labor standards are applicable to the work test in section 202(a)(3),EUCA by virtue of section 202 (a)(3)(D)(iii). Therefore, this position,regarding members of labor organizations and the labor standards in Statelaw, applies without exception to section 202(a)(3) regardless of whetheran individual's job prospects are classified or determined to be ``good''or ``not good.''The preamble of the proposed rule noted that the proposed rule containedsome provisions on the EB work test that differed from guidance previouslyfurnished to the States. The comments received reveal that there is a lackof understanding of the Department's position on some matters left to theStates under the labor standards and section 202(a)(3), EUCA. Therefore,the regulations are changed in this final rule to make it clearer thatwhether union members must seek and accept nonunion work in their customaryoccupations is a matter left to each State to determine under its law.In addition, each State must determine under its law whether a union member,who (1) the State has determined to have ``good'' job prospects and (2)who normally obtains work in his/her customary occupation through a hiringhall, must seek and accept work other than through the union hiring hall.On these two matters regarding the work search the applicable State lawapplies, as is required by section 202(a)(2), and within the intendmentof section 202(a)(3)(D)(iii), EUCA. Such State law provisions with respectto the labor standards that pertain to nonunion work and members of laborunions ``are not inconsistent with the provisions of subparagraphs (C)and (E)''. In this connection, as noted above, the final rule is also clarifiedto convey that section 202(a)(3), EUCA does not require or permit claimantsfor sharable compensation to be required to seek work which is an exceptionto section 202(a)(3)(A)(i) as specified in section 202(a)(3)(D). That is,section 202(a)(3) does not require claimants for sharable compensation(or permit to be required) to seek work which if refused could not justifiablyresult in the imposition of the 4andmultiply;4 disqualification for failingto accept any offer of suitable work.Section 615.2(o)(9) ``Tangible evidence'' of an active search for workThe proposed regulation at andSection; 615.2(o)(9) defines ``tangible evidence''of an active search for work for the purposes of section 202(a)(3)(E) ofEUCA. Comments were received from two SESAs on this definition. One SESAquestioned the necessity of including the type of work being sought andthe listing of every contact with an employer in the documentation of ``tangibleevidence'' of an active search for work. The other SESA suggested thatthe ``tangible evidence'' include the method used to seek work to enablea State to determine if an individual's search for work was ``systematic''.The definition of ``tangible evidence'' does not require listing of everyemployer contact an individual makes during a given week. However, theState must require claimants to list, at a minimum, the number of employercontacts the State has determined to be evidence of a sustained searchfor work during such week. The number of contacts with prospective employersa SESA requires individuals to make during a week to demonstrate a ``systematicand sustained'' search for work will vary according to the characteristicsof the labor market areas within the State. Therefore, States must designthe form used to obtain ``tangible evidence'', as set forth in andSection;615.2(o)(9), of an active search for work during a week with space fora sufficient number of entries of work search (employer) contacts to accommodatethe variations in the number of employers and characteristics of the variouslocal labor market areas within the State. The States that use one formstatewide for individuals to report ``tangible evidence'' of a systematicand sustained search for work should design this form, the report of work-seekingactivities, with space sufficient for claimants to enter the number ofemployer contacts required to demonstrate a systematic and sustained searchfor work during a week(s) in the labor market area in the State with thelargest number of employers.The listing of the type of work sought as an element of information inthe ``tangible evidence'' of the individual's efforts to obtain work isnecessary for monitoring of claimants' continuing eligibility for ExtendedBenefits. ``Suitable work'' for individuals whose prospects of obtainingwork in their customary occupations in a reasonably short period are determinedto be ``not good'' is any work that the individual has the physical andmental capacity to perform. A SESA that does not require claimants to reportthe type of work being sought will be unable to determine if an individual'ssearch for work is systematic. The SESA will be unable to determine ifan individual whose job prospects are ``not good'' is limiting the searchfor work to a customary occupation or is conducting the required searchfor any work that the claimant has the physical or mental ability to performand which meets the criteria of section 202(a)(3)(D), EUCA. Similarly, the method used to seek work is a necessary element in the ``tangibleevidence'' because it enables the States to determine if an individual'ssearch for work was ``systematic''. That is, a method of applying for employmentis ``systematic'' when it is the appropriate method for the particularjob being sought because it is the method by which most individuals inthe particular job were hired. For example, applying for work by telephoneis not a systematic method of seeking work if an individual makes a telephonecall to an employer who hires only through in-person job applications.Although ``actions taken'' could be construed to include the method ofapplying for employment, the Department has added ``method of applyingfor work'' to the information required for tangible evidence of an activesearch for work to make the definition in andSection; 615.12(o)(9) clearer.The type of work being sought will be retained in the definition of ``tangibleevidence'' because it is necessary for monitoring the active search todetermine if an individual's search for work is systematic. Section 615.2(o)(12) ``Hospitalized for treatment of an emergency or life-threateningcondition'' Pub. L. 98-21 amended EUCA section 202(a)(3) to provide exceptions to thedisqualification for failing to actively search for work which could bepurged only if the individual returned to work for at least 4 weeks andearned at least 4 times the weekly benefit amount. Section 202(a)(3)(A)(ii)of EUCA permits the States to determine weekly eligibility for claimantsof extended benefits who are hospitalized for treatment of an emergencyor a life-threatening condition based on the availability for work provisionsif the same provisions in State law are applicable to claimants for regularbenefits which are not sharable. A SESA commented that the definition of the term ``hospitalized for treatmentof an emergency or life threatening condition'' was an unduly complex definitionand that this term could be left for the States to interpret. The Department issued Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No.41-83 to implement the amendment to the EUCA required by Pub. L. 98-21.In this program letter, the Department stated that it would incorporatethe definition of this term as set forth in the UIPL in a future amendmentto the Extended Benefit regulations. Therefore, andSection; 615.2(o)(12)repeats the words in the definition of the term, ``hospitalized for treatmentof an emergency or life threatening condition'' that were in UIPL 41-83.The Department defined the term because the EUCA specifically providesfor the definition of the term ``as such term may be defined by'' the Secretaryof Labor. The definition may be considered complex because it includesmore than one part; however, it is not a definition that is difficult tounderstand. Significantly, the definition conveys precise meaning. Therefore,the definition at andSection; 615.2(o)(12) is not changed or deleted becausedeleting the definition would ignore a duty imposed by law and create thepossibility of inconsistencies in the application of this provision. Section 615.2(p)(1) (ii) and (iii) The ``first two weeks'' as used in section202(c), EUCA The proposed rule at andSection; 615.2(p)(1) (ii) and (iii) defines visitingand transient claims as claims not filed under the interstate benefit (IB)payment plan and therefore not subject to the two-week limitation whichapplies to IB claims filed in an agent State not in an EB period. A SESA suggested that andSection; 615.2(p)(1) clarify if the two-week limitationon Extended Benefit payments of section 202(c), EUCA, applies to an individualwho resides in a State that is not in an Extended Benefit Period but whoreports and files intrastate claims in a bordering State that is in anExtended Benefit Period. Another SESA questioned if excluding visitingand transient claims from the ``two-week'' IB provision would result inan uneven application of this restriction because practices of acceptingtransient and visiting claims vary from locality to locality. This last comment is interpreted to mean that some visiting claimants areerroneously required to file IB initial claims; therefore, all transientand visiting claims should be processed as IB initial claims. Such claimsprocessing would only increase the number of errors. The language of section202(c)(1), EUCA, specifically limits the application of the denial aftertwo weeks to claims filed under the IB plan. Transient claims and visitingclaims which are not filed under the interstate plan are intrastate claimsand therefore are not subject to the two-week IB denial provision. Similarly,intrastate claims filed by an individual who resides in a State that isnot in an Extended Benefit Period is not a claim filed under the IB planand therefore not subject to the two-week denial provision of section 202(c)of the Act. The final regulations include language to clarify that section202(c) of the Act does not apply to intrastate Extended Benefit claimsfiled by individuals who reside in a State that is not in an Extended BenefitPeriod. Sections 615.2(p)(1) (ii) and (iii) will not be changed to applythe two-week denial to visiting or transient claims in the final regulationsbecause such a change would be contrary to the law, EUCA, section 202(c).Section 615.7(c)(3) Changes in accounts The proposed rule at andSection; 615.7(c)(3) provides for adjustments toextended benefit accounts made necessary by a redetermination or an appealwhich awards an individual more or less regular unemployment compensation.A SESA identified an omission in andSection; 615.7(c)(3); that is, ``If suchdecision reduces the duration of regular compensation payable to the individual,the claim for extended benefits shall be backdated to the earliest date,subsequent to the date when the redetermined regular compensation was exhaustedand within the individual's eligibility period, that the individual waseligible to file a claim for Extended Benefits.'' The final sentence ofthe present regulation also was omitted. This language omitted in andSection; 615.7(c)(3) of the proposed rule isrestored in the final regulation, and other unintended errors in paragraphs(c)(2) and (c)(3) are corrected. It is the Department's position that the``work test'' may not be applied retroactively. Therefore, when there isa backdating of an individual's claim prior to the date of the individual'soriginal claim for Extended Benefits, no retroactive disqualification maybe imposed for failing to meet the eligibility requirements of section202(a)(3)(A), EUCA, except a disqualification beginning as provided inandSection; 615.8(h)(4) of the final regulation. Section 615.8(c) Terminating disqualifications The proposed rule at andSection; 615.8(c) provides that for certain disqualificationsan individual must have employment required by State law subsequent tothe disqualification to terminate the disqualifications for purposes ofeligibility for Extended Benefits. A SESA requested that the regulationsexplain if Extended Benefits would be denied under andSection; 615.8(c) ofthe proposed rule when a State law (``Robert Fabric'' decision) providesthat an individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of subsequentregular or Extended Benefits to the extent that such benefits would havedecreased by virtue of earnings from part-time employment that the individualquit, was discharged from or refused to accept. Under section 202(a)(4) of the EUCA, no provision of State law or interpretationof State law which terminates a disqualification for voluntarily leavingemployment, being discharged for misconduct or refusing an offer of suitableemployment shall apply for purposes of payment of Extended Benefits, unlesssuch termination is based upon employment, as required by State law, subsequentto the date of such disqualification. Thus, in the example given, an individualwhose eligibility for (reduced) regular benefit payments continues aftera disqualification and where the State law does not require subsequentemployment to purge the disqualification would not be eligible to receiveor continue to receive extended compensation. The language in andSection;615.8(c)(2) of the proposed rule,<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * shall require that the individual be employed again subsequentto the date of the disqualification before it may be terminated, even thoughit may have been terminated on other grounds * * *,</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">is adequate to prohibit payment of Extended Benefits in the examplegiven and similar situations when a disqualification is served or purgedby penalties other than subsequent employment. Section 202(a)(4) is aneligibility requirement, and it is a requirement for State laws. For thisreason no change will be made in the final regulations at andSection; 615.8(c).Section 615.8(d) Determinations of job prospects The proposed rule at andSection; 615.8(d) provides that the SESAs shall classifyeach individual's prospects of obtaining employment in his/her customaryoccupation in a reasonably short period as ``good'' or ``not good''. TheSESA's classification of the individual's prospects of obtaining employmentin his/her customary occupation in a reasonably short period as ``good''or ``not good'' is made at the filing of an initial claim. A SESA recommendedthat this section be eliminated. The SESA contends that this procedureis administratively cumbersome and costly and because the individual'sjob prospects only affect whether the suitable work provisions in Statelaw (for regular benefit claimants) or the suitable work provisions inState law corresponding to sections 202(a)(3) (C) and (D), EUCA, shallapply. Another SESA objected to andSection; 615.8(d)(3) because of the problemof funding (cost of administering) the job prospects classification becauseclassifying an individual's job prospects was not a separately reportableworkload item for funding purposes. The classification of an individual's job prospects as ``good'' or ``notgood'', as provided under andSection; 615.8(d), is necessary to determinewhat constitutes ``suitable work'' under EUCA section 202(a)(3)(C). Theindividual's job prospects classification will establish the type of workthe individual must seek and accept to maintain eligibility for ExtendedBenefits. To enable claimants to preserve this eligibility it is mandatorythat the State classify and inform claimants of their job prospects andthe kind of jobs they must accept and actively seek each week. This informationis essential to enable claimants to protect their rights and understandwhat they must do to meet the eligibility requirements in State law forExtended Benefits. The States' duty to inform claimants of their responsibilitiesis explained in <T3>Information to claimants </T3>at andSection; 615.8(h) of these regulations.With respect to the comment that the job prospects classifications causea funding problem, the minutes per unit (MPU) for Extended Benefit initialclaims were increased on the Department's initiative to simplify administrativefinancing (Administrative Financing Initiative). The increased MPU forExtended Benefit initial claims includes the time for classifying an individual'sjob prospects. The job prospects classification is not a separately appealablenonmonetary determination. The determination with respect to job prospectsis part of the fact finding in any suitable work or active search for workdetermination that is made when an issue arises and a determination mustbe made. Therefore, the requirement of classification of an individual'sjob prospects at andSection; 615.8(d) is retained in the final regulations.Section 615.8(f) Refusal of work and andSection; 615.8(g) Actively seekingwork Sections 615.8 (f) and (g) provide for the conditions for disqualifyingan individual for failing to conduct the required search for work and forfailing to apply for or accept an offer of suitable work. These sectionsalso explain the disqualification which applies for such failures and relatesuitable work to a determination of the individual's job prospects. A SESAcommented that in previous issuances the disqualification for failing toapply for or accept an offer of suitable work if job prospects were determinedto be ``good'' was the disqualification provision in State law applicableto claims for regular compensation for refusing an offer of suitable work.The SESA also commented that the EB work test (sections 202(a)(3)(A) (i)and (ii)) of EUCA should not be applied to weeks of Extended Benefits paidretroactively. It is Department's position that the work test may not be applied retroactively,as explained in our response to the comment regarding andSection; 615.7(c)(3)of the proposed rule. We concur with this comment and the final regulationis consistent with this view. The final rule provides, as did the proposed rule, that an individual shallbe ineligible for Extended Benefits for the week the individual fails toconduct the required search for work or fails to accept or apply for anoffer of suitable work. The individual's ineligibility shall continue thereafteruntil he/she is employed in at least four weeks with wages from such employmenttotalling not less than four times the individual's weekly benefit amount(4X4 disqualification), regardless of the individual's job prospects. Thisis based on a closer reading of sections 202(a)(3) (A) and (B) of the Act,and is a change from guidance previously furnished to the States. Subparagraph(B) relates the 4X4 disqualification to sections 202(a)(3)(A) (i) and (ii)without regard to the individual's job prospects. As provided in EUCA section202(a)(3)(C), suitable work for an individual whose job prospects are ``good''is determined in accordance with State law applicable to regular compensation.Section 202(a)(3)(C) makes no reference to the disqualification in applicableState law for refusing an offer of suitable work. On the other hand, section202(a)(3)(B) specifically applies to any failure described in clause (i)or (ii) of subparagraph (A). Therefore, whether the failure is of a clause(i) or clause (ii) type, the 4X4 disqualification applies, and it is irrelevantfor these purposes whether the claimant's job prospects are classifiedor determined to be ``good'' or ``not good''. For these reasons, no changeis made to the final regulations. Section 615.12 Determination of ``on'' and ``off'' Indicators The proposed rule at andSection; 615.12 provides for the computation by theState agency of the rate of insured unemployment statewide for purposesof triggering ``on'' or ``off'' the payment of extended benefits in theState. Only one SESA commented on the method of determining ``on'' and``off'' indicators for the purpose of paying Extended Benefits. The SESA commented that the formula for triggering ``on'' Extended Benefitsdoes not work for it because of the State's huge land area. The unemployedworkers in areas of high unemployment within the State are not eligiblefor Extended Benefits, in spite of their great need, because the triggerfor Extended Benefits is based on the statewide rate of insured unemployment.The SESA suggested that different triggers be developed which would bringabout more equitable treatment of the unemployed workers in a State largein land area comparable to benefits provided to unemployed workers in smallerStates. The SESA further commented on the apparent widening of the gapbetween the total unemployment rate (TUR) in the State and the insuredunemployment rate (IUR) and the possibility of establishing new indicatorsfor Extended Benefits by combining the IUR and the TUR. The State alsocommented that it has never triggered ``on'' Extended Benefits based onthe State IUR and that the State is ill-served by the current triggersfor the Extended Benefit Program that respond only to the statewide rateof insured unemployment.On June 18, 1987, the Department of Labor published for competitive biddinga request for proposals (RFP) to conduct a study of the feasibility ofsubstate area triggers for the payment of unemployment benefits. The purposeof this study is to design substate area benefit policy options under whichExtended Benefits could be paid for durations beyond the regular UI programin depressed labor market areas while avoiding the payment of ExtendedBenefits in labor market areas that are not depressed. The study will beconducted from 10/1/87 to 3/31/89. The Department of Labor does not havethe legal authority to establish triggering mechanisms for the paymentof Extended Benefits based on unemployment in substate areas, or to alterthe trigger criteria, because the EUCA specifically provides for triggersbased solely on the statewide rate of insured unemployment. The interestsof the State in changing the triggers would have to be addressed by legislation,not through the regulatory process. The study is designed to provide theDepartment and the Congress with the information and analysis necessaryto make a responsible decision about this matter. Therefore, no changeis made to the final regulations at andSection; 615.12. Section 615.12(d)(1) Amendment of State indicator rates The proposed rule at andSection; 615.12(d)(1) establishes a time limit formaking retroactive corrections to State ``on'' or ``off'' or ``no change''indicators. It also provides that any changes to the indicators withinthe time limit shall be subject to the concurrence of the Department. ASESA commented that this regulation could result in a State not receivingfunds for the cost of taking initial Extended Benefits claims when an ``on''indicator is amended during the third week following the indicator week.The SESA also commented that the phrase ``concurrence of the Department''needed clarification. Any State that processes Extended Benefits initial claims workload priorto amending an ``on'' indicator shall receive funds only for the administrativecost by activity by reporting the EB initial claims on the ETA 5159 reportand in the EB section of the Quarterly Financial Report (UI 3). The Stateshould explain in a footnote on the UI 3 why there is Extended Benefitinitial claims activity when the State was not in an Extended Benefit Period.The first comment appears to argue for reducing the time allowed to theStates for amending an indicator to less than three weeks after the indicatorweek. This regulation allows the States only eight calendar days from thedue date of the States' initial notice to the Secretary to discover errorsin counts or computations and to amend their indicator rates. As providedin andSection; 615.12(e), a State must notify the Secretary within 10 daysafter the end of any week if there is an ``on'' or ``off'' or ``no change''indicator in the State. A reduction in the time to amend State indicatorsfrom three weeks to two weeks would in fact allow a State only four daysto make such corrections and recomputations. The Department believes thateight days is a reasonable and suitable amount of time to allow Statesto discover errors and to make recomputations necessary for amending theirindicators. For these reasons, the time limit for amending a State indicatorwill not be changed in the final regulations. Further, the commenter iscorrect that a State is not entitled to Federal sharing in any benefitspaid outside an Extended Benefit Period or otherwise not in accordancewith the terms and conditions of the Federal-State Extended UnemploymentCompensation Act of 1970. The concurrence of the Department means that the amendment of a State indicatorshall not become final until the notice of amendment to a State indicatoris accepted by the Department as provided in andSection; 615.12(e). Paragraph(e) of andSection; 615.12 provides that an indicator notice shall not becomefinal until it is accepted by the Department. An amended indicator noticemust also be acceptable to the Department. Accordingly, a reference toparagraph (e) of this section is included in paragraph (d) to define the``concurrence of the Department'' in the final regulation. Section 615.14 Payments to States The proposed regulation at andSection; 615.14(d) provides that the Departmentof Labor may withhold reimbursement of the Federal share to a State orrequire repayment of the Federal share of payments previously reimbursedfor any payments that were not Extended Benefits because they were notpaid under the terms and conditions that are consistent with the EUCA orthe regulations. Seven SESAs (New York, Nevada, Tennessee, Illinois, WestVirginia, Vermont and Ohio) questioned the legal authority of the Secretaryto mandate withholding or recovering reimbursement of the Federal sharefor ``Any payment made to a claimant for any week with respect to whichthe claimant was either ineligible for or not entitled to the payment.''Three of the SESAs' comments included requests for clarification of thissection. One of the SESAs contended that the proposed rules are contraryto the conformity procedures set forth in sections 3304 and 3310 of theFederal Unemployment Tax Act (notice, fair hearing and judicial review)and undermine the traditional sharing of Extended Benefit costs betweenthe States and the Federal Government. One SESA commented that andSection;615.14(d) was inconsistent with Region V SESA Letter No. 57-85, and objectedonly if the proposed rules at andSection;andSection; 615.14 (c) and (d) areretroactively applied.Two SESAs commented that the proposed rules at andSection;andSection; 615.14(c) and (d) would require States to bear the full cost of any ExtendedBenefits paid which are subsequently determined to have been overpaid.A SESA commented that this runs counter to other federally-mandated benefitprograms (UCFE, UCX, and FSC) which provide that the Federal account isonly credited when overpaid benefits are recouped. One of the SESAs contendsthat in withholding reimbursement or requiring repayment based on a State'smisinterpretation of Federal law or regulation, andSection; 615.14(d) doesnot distinguish between a misinterpretation which is a blatant disregardof Federal law requirements, errors caused by honest misunderstanding orerrors caused by conflicting or incorrect Federal directives. Several SESAsrecommend that this section be rewritten so as to provide for the usualState procedures for overpayment determinations and recovery of EB overpaymentswith the Federal share credited to the Extended Unemployment CompensationAccount upon recovery. Two SESAs commented that andSection; 615.14(c)(9)means that the States will be responsible for the entire cost of any overpaymentmade under the Extended Benefit program. One SESA commented that only sharableregular benefits were subject to nonreimbursement after March 31, 1981with respect to the unpaid waiting week provision in section 204(a)(2)(B)of the EUCA. Therefore, the proposed rule erroneously indicates that extendedcompensation was subject to nonreimbursement after March 31, 1981 ratherthan after September 25, 1982. No changes were made in response to the foregoing comments on andSection;615.14 for the reasons which follow. The procedural requirements and substantiverules for reimbursing States for the Federal share of sharable extendedcompensation and sharable regular compensation are set forth in section204, EUCA. Section 204(a)(1) provides that_<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) There shall be paid to each State an amount equal to one halfof the sum of_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) the sharable extended compensation, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) the sharable regular compensation, paid to individuals under theState law.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The term ``sharable extended compensation'' is defined in section204(b) of the Act as Extended Benefits paid to an individual in the individual'seligibility period, up to the maximum limit prescribed in EUCA section202(b)(1). Extended compensation is itself separately defined in section205(3) as:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * compensation * * * payable for weeks of unemployment beginningin an extended benefit period to an individual under those provisions ofthe State law which satisfy the requirements of this title with respectto the payment of extended compensation.</ITAG>Thus, sharable extended compensation is only those Extended Benefits paid``under those provisions of the State law which satisfy the requirementsof this title with respect to the payment of'' Extended Benefits. Sections201-203 of the Act prescribe these requirements. Any benefit payment madeunder a State law that is not in accordance with those terms and conditionsis not sharable extended compensation as defined in section 204(b) of theAct, since it is not extended compensation as defined in section 205(3)of the Act. Similarly, any payment to an individual for any week the individualwas, for any reason, either ineligible for, or not entitled to, the paymentis not sharable extended compensation because the payment is not in accordwith the terms and conditions of sections 201-203 of the Act. This alsomeans that any overpayment of extended compensation, whether or not theState waives recovery of such overpayment, is not sharable extended compensationbecause the payment did not satisfy the requirements of the Act with respectto the payment of Extended Benefits. This conclusion is supported by section 204(d) of the Act, which reguiresthe Secretary to estimate the monthly payment each State ``is entitledto receive'' under the Act. No State is entitled to receive more than paymentfor the benefits described above, that is, its sharable benefits as definedin the Act. Therefore, section 204 of the Act precludes a payment to anyState with respect to any benefit payment that was not paid under provisionsof a State law that accord with all the terms and conditions for the paymentof Extended Benefits specified in sections 201-203 of the Act. Where thereis no authority to make a payment under section 204, there is no rightin a State to receive a payment or obligation on the Secretary to makea payment. Section 204(d) of the Act states:<ITAG tagnum="21">(d) There shall be paid to each State either in advance or by wayof reimbursement, as may be determined by the Secretary, such sum as theSecretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this titlefor each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by anysum by which the Secretary finds that his estimates for any prior calendarmonth were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paidto the State. Such estimates may be made upon the basis of such statistical,sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and theState agency.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 204(d) provides the sole basis upon which the Secretary shalldetermine the amount which each State is to be paid each month. No hearingprocedure is provided for or required under section 204. The financialassistance provisions of section 204 are not a part of the requirementsencompassed by section 3304(a)(11) of the FUTA, and therefore, the proceduralrequirements of sections 3304 (c) and (d) of the FUTA are inapplicableto EUCA section 204. Paragraph (d) of andSection; 615.14, however, sets fortha procedure for informal resolution of differences that may arise, whichincludes opportunities for the State to present its views and arguments.In addition to the procedures set forth in andSection; 615.14, the Departmentmay, in the exercise of its authority to assure that Federal funds areproperly spent, alternatively recoup overpayments through the audit process.The comparison of the overpayment recovery procedures for Federal benefitoverpayments with the Federal share of Extended Benefit overpayments andthe application of the <T3>Lopez Rule </T3>to Extended Benefits are not apt. The States have enteredinto agreements with the Secretary to administer the Federal unemploymentbenefit programs (UCFE, UCX, TAA, DUA, FSC). The States act as agents forthe Secretary to pay Federal unemployment benefits. On the other hand,Extended Benefits are State benefits for which the States receive 50 percentreimbursement as the Federal share. The conditions for reimbursing theStates for sharable extended compensation are set forth in section 204of the Act. Under these provisions and andSection; 615.14, a State is entitledto be reimbursed for its cost of paying sharable benefits, which is tosay benefits paid to eligible claimants in accordance with State law correspondingin all respects with the terms and conditions of sections 201-203 of theAct, except as such sharing is precluded by the provisions of sections202(a)(6) and 204. The sequence of audit reports and the intervals between the draft auditand the final determination for UI audit resolution in SESA Letter No.57-85 are not consistent with andSection; 615.14(d) of the proposed rulebecause they are separate and distinct processes. Section 615.14(d) providesan informal procedure for the adjustment of payments to a State under theauthority in section 204(d) of the Act, whereas the SESA letter concernsaudit resolutions. They are therefore different processes. For the reasonsabove, no change will be made to the final regulations at andSection; 615.14.However, the final rule is clarified by adding a new paragraph (3) to thedefinition of ``sharable compensation'' in andSection; 615.2(i) to assureconsistency with andSection; 615.14. When the proposal to revise the EB regulations was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in 1986, it was the Department's position thatfor a State to receive Federal sharing for extended and sharable regularcompensation, the State was required to apply provisons of its law conformingto section 202(a)(3), EUCA to weeks of unemployment beginning after March31, 1981. This was the date set forth in section 1024(b) of Pub. L. 96-499and this date was the effective date for both extended and sharable regularcompensation. However, for purposes of determining the Federal share ofweeks of unemployment beginnning after March 31,1981, section 9151 of theBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203) changed the originaleffective date of section 202(a)(3) (March 31, 1981 as specified in section1024(b) of Pub. L. 96-499) to weeks of unemployment beginning after October31, 1981. This change makes extended and sharable regular compensationsharable for weeks of unemployment beginning after March 31, 1981 to October31, 1981. If a State's legislature did not meet in 1981, section 202(a)(3),EUCA would apply to weeks of unemployment beginning after October 31, 1982.Therefore, the March 31, 1981, effective date for section 202(a)(3), EUCAin the proposed rule will be changed to weeks beginning after October 31,1981 in the final regulation. Pub. L. 96-499 amended the EUCA by adding paragraphs (3) to (5) to section202(a). Section 202(a)(3) provides for active search for work and ``suitablework'' requirements for the payment of Extended Benefits; section 202(a)(4)relates to eligibility after certain disqualifications. The amendmentsto the EUCA in Pub. L. 96-499 appear under the heading ``Limitation onExtended Unemployment Compensation Program''. In addition, the languagein 202(a)(3)(A) of the Act specifically refers only to ``payment of extendedcompensation * * *.'' Therefore, Congress included old section 202(a)(5):<ITAG tagnum="21">No payment shall be made under this Act to any State in respect toany sharable regular compensation paid to any individual for any week if,under the rules of paragraphs (3) and (4), extended compensation wouldnot have been payable to such individual for such week.</ITAG>The addition of this section 202(a)(5) meant that the active search forwork and suitable work provisions in section 202(a)(3) of the Act (andsection 202(a)(4)) would apply to regular compensation not as a requirementper se, but only as a condition of a State's entitlement to Federal sharingof regular compensation. With this purpose there was no need for the Congressto refer to the issue of Federal sharing for extended compensation in section202(a)(5) of the Act, because sections 202(a)(3) and (4) are eligibilityrequirements for payment of Extended Benefits. Congress included section202(a)(5), cited above, so that States which pay beyond 26 weeks of regularunemployment compensation and which did not choose to comply with sections202(a) (3) and (4) would not be entitled to Federal sharing for regularcompensation that would be otherwise sharable. However, the fact that section 202(a)(5) did not refer to extended compensationled to misunderstanding. Therefore, in 1981, Congress amended old section202(a)(5) by adding the words ``extended compensation or.'' When Pub. L.97-35 amended the EUCA to insert ``extended compensation or'' before ``sharableregular compensation'' in section 202(a)(6) (formerly (5)) of the Act,it created no new authority in regard to the requirements in sections 202(a)(3) and (4) of the Act. It simply clarified authority that already existed.Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations.Section 615.14(c)(8) Payments not to be reimbursed The proposed regulation at andSection; 615.14(c)(8) provides that the Departmentshall not reimburse States for the 50 percent Federal share of the amountby which sharable regular or Extended Benefits paid to any individual exceedsthe nearest lower full dollar amount if the State does not provide fora benefit structure under which benefits are rounded down to the next lowerdollar. A SESA commented that for the benefit of its claimants it roundsup the maximum benefit amount to the next higher dollar amount. The SESAexpressed a preference for full reimbursement for the 50 percent Federalshare when benefits are rounded up. Section 204(a)(2)(D), EUCA, is specific. It limits reimbursement to theStates of the Federal share of Extended Benefits paid if the States' benefitstructure does not provide for rounding down to the next lower dollar amountin all circumstances. The regulations may not be written to contradictor change this provision of the Act and to authorize reimbursing Statesfor the Federal share of Extended Benefits Paid when the State's benefitstructure does not provide for rounding down to the next lower dollar amount.As in other matters of cost sharing, it is the State's choice to complywith the Federal law and obtain the benefits of such compliance; the Departmentis not authorized to permit the State to evade compliance and yet obtainthe benefit. Therefore, andSection; 615.14(c)(8) will be published in thefinal regulations without change. Section 615.15(c) Weekly record of Extended Benefit data The proposed regulation at andSection; 615.15(c) prescribes the frequencyand contents of the ETA 539 report. A SESA commented that the proposedrule identified this report as the ETA 5-39 and that in other issuancesthis report is identified as the ETA 539 report. The hyphen in 539 in theproposed rule was included through inadvertance. The hyphen is deletedin the final regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Changes </ITAG>Other technical and clarifying changes are made throughout the regulations,including correcting errors of inclusion and exclusion in the Notice ofproposed Rulemaking published on October 24, 1986 (most notably in andSection;andSection;615.7(c)(3) and 615.8(e)(6)). Also as noted in the preamble of the Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking, particularly as it relates to the requirementsof section 202(a)(3), EUCA, these regulations differ from guidance previouslyfurnished to the States in other issuances prior to the publication ofthe Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction and control of the Directorof the Unemployment.

(2) A State law may, however, consistently with section 3303(a)(1), requirethe charging of Extended Benefits paid to an individual; and if it does,it may provide for charging all or any portion of such compensation paid.(3) Sharable regular compensation must be charged as all other regularcompensation is charged under the State law. (b) <T3>Payments by reimbursing employers. </T3>If an employer is reimbursingthe State unemployment fund in lieu of paying contributions pursuant tothe requirements of State law conforming with sections 3304(a)(6)(B) and3309(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 3304(a)(6)(B)and 3309(a)(2)), the State law shall require the employer to reimbursethe State unemployment fund for not less than 50 percent of any sharablecompensation that is attributable under the State law to service with suchemployer; and as to any compensation which is not sharable compensationunder andSection; 615.14, the State law shall require the employer to reimbursethe State unemployment fund for 100 percent, instead of 50 percent, ofany such compensation paid. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 615.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Extended Benefit Periods. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Beginning date. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section,an Extended Benefit Period shall begin in a State on the first day of thethird calendar week after a week for which there is a State ``on'' indicatorin that State. (b) <T3>Ending date. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section,an Extended Benefit Period in a State shall end on the last day of thethird week after the first week for which there is a State ``off'' indicatorin that State.

(2) There is a State ``off'' indicator in a State for a week if the headof the State agency determines, in accordance with this section, that,for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding 12weeks, the rate of insured unemployment (not seasonally adjusted) underthe State law_ (i) Was less than 120 percent of the average of such rates for the corresponding13 week periods ending in each of the preceding two calendar years, or(ii) Was less than 5.0 percent. (3) The standard State indicators in this paragraph (a) shall apply toweeks beginning after September 25, 1982. (b) <T3>Optional State indicators. </T3>(1)(i) A State may, in addition tothe State indicators in paragraph (a) of this section, provide by its lawthat there shall be a State ``on'' indicator in the State for a week ifthe head of the State agency determines, in accordance with this section,that, for the period consisting of that week and the immediately preceding12 weeks, the rate of insured unemployment (not seasonally adjusted) underthe State law equalled or exceeded 6.0 percent even though it did not meetthe 120 percent factor required under paragraph (a). (ii) A State which adopts the optional State indicator must also providethat, when it is in an Extended Benefit Period, there will not be an ``off''indicator until (A) the State rate of insured unemployment is less than6.0 percent, and (B) either its rate of insured unemployment is less than5.0 percent or is less than 120 percent of the average of such rates forthe corresponding 13-week periods ending in each of the preceding two calendaryears. (2) The optional State indicators in this paragraph (b) shall apply toweeks beginning after September 25, 1982. (c) <T3>Computation of rate of insured unemployment.</T3>_(1) <T3>Equation. </T3>Each week the State agency head shall calculate therate of insured unemployment under the State law (not seasonally adjusted)for purposes of determining the State ``on'' and ``off'' and ``no change''indicators. In making such calculations the State agency head shall usea fraction, the numerator of which shall be the weekly average number ofweeks claimed in claims filed (not seasonally adjusted) in the State inthe 13-week period ending with the week for which the determination ismade, and the denominator of which shall be the average monthly employmentcovered by the State law for the first four of the last six calendar quartersending before the close of the 13-week period. The quotient obtained isto be computed to four decimal places, and is not otherwise rounded, andis to be expressed as a percentage by multiplying the resultant decimalfraction by 100. (2) <T3>Counting weeks claimed. </T3>To determine the average number of weeksclaimed in claims filed to serve as the numerator under paragraph (c)(1),the State agency shall include claims for all weeks for regular compensation,including claims taken as agent State under the Interstate Benefit PaymentPlan. It shall exclude claims_ (i) For Extended Benefits under any State law, (ii) For additional compensation under any State law, and (iii) Under any Federal law except joint claims which combine regular compensationand compensation payable under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 85.(3) <T3>Method of computing the State 120 percent factor. </T3>The rate ofinsured unemployment for a current 13-week period shall be divided by theaverage of the rates of insured unemployment for the corresponding 13-weekperiods in each of the two preceding calendar years to determine whetherthe rate is equal to 120 percent of the average rate for the two years.The quotient obtained shall be computed to four decimal places and nototherwise rounded, and shall be expressed as a percentage by multiplyingthe resultant decimal fraction by 100. The average of the rates for thecorresponding 13-week periods in each of the two preceding calendar yearsshall be one-half the sum of such rates computed to four decimal placesand not otherwise rounded. To determine which are the corresponding weeksin the preceding years_ (i) The weeks shall be numbered starting with week number 1 as the firstweek ending in each calendar year. (ii) The 13-week period ending with any numbered week in the current yearshall correspond to the period ending with that same numbered week in eachpreceding year. (iii) When that period in the current year ends with week number 53, thecorresponding period in preceding years shall end with week number 52 ifthere is no week number 53. (d) <T3>Amendment of State indicator rates. </T3>(1) Because figures used fordeterminations under this section may contain errors and because it isnot practical to apply any correction in a State ``on'' or ``off'' or ``nochange'' indicator retroactively either to recover amounts paid or to adjudicateclaims for past periods in which claimants failed to make the requiredactive search for work, any determination by the head of a State agencyof an ``on'' or ``off'' or ``no change'' indicator shall not be correctedmore than three weeks after the close of the week to which it applies.If any figure used in the computation of a rate of insured unemploymentis later found to be wrong, the correct figure shall be used to redeterminethe rate of insured unemployment and of the 120 percent factor for thatweek and all subsequent weeks, but no determination of previous ``on''or ``off'' or ``no change'' indicator shall be affected unless the redeterminationis made within the time the indicator may be corrected under the firstsentence of this paragraph (d)(1). Any change hereunder shall be subjectto the concurrence of the Department as provided in paragraph (e) of thissection. (2) Any determination of the rate of insured unemployment and its effecton an ``on'' or ``off'' or ``no change'' indicator may be challenged byappeal or by other proceedings, as shall be provided by State law, butthe implementation of any change in the indicator from one week to anothershall not be stayed or postponed. In a hearing on any such challenge theissue may be limited to the accuracy of the determination of the rate ofinsured unemployment. If an error in that rate affecting the ``on'' or``off'' or ``no change'' indicator is discovered in such a hearing or otherproceeding, its retroactive effect shall be limited as provided in paragraph(d)(1). (e) <T3>Notice to Secretary. </T3>Within 10 calendar days after the end ofany week with respect to which the head of a State agency has determinedthat there is an ``on,'' or ``off,'' or ``no change'' indicator in theState, the head of the State agency shall notify the Department of thedetermination. The notice shall state clearly the State agency head's determinationof the specific week for which there is a State ``on'' or ``off'' or ``nochange'' indicator. The notice shall include also the State agency head'sfindings supporting the determination, with a certification that the findingsare made in accordance with the requirements of this andSection; 615.15.Determinations and findings made as provided in this section shall be acceptedby the Department, but the head of the State agency shall comply with suchprovisions as the Department may find necessary to assure the correctnessand verification of notices given under this paragraph. A notice shallnot become final for purposes of the Act and this part until such noticeis accepted by the Department. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 615.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Announcement of the beginning and ending of Extended Benefit Periods.</ITAG>(a) <T3>State indicators. </T3>Upon receipt of the notice required by andSection;615.12(e) which is acceptable to the Department, the Department shall publishin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a notice of the State agency head's determinationthat there is an ``on'' or an ``off'' indicator in the State, as the casemay be, the name of the State and the beginning or ending of the ExtendedBenefit Period, whichever is appropriate. The Department shall also notifyappropriate news media, the heads of all other State agencies, and theRegional Administrators of the Employment and Training Administration ofthe State agency head's determination of such State ``on'' or ``off'' indicatorand of its effect. (b) <T3>Publicity by State. </T3>Whenever a State agency head determines thatthere is an ``on'' indicator in the State by reason of which an ExtendedBenefit Period will begin in the State, or an ``off'' indicator by reasonof which an Extended Benefit Period in the State will end, the head ofthe State agency shall promptly announce the determination through appropriatenews media in the State and notify the Department in accordance with andSection;615.12(e). Such announcement shall include the beginning or ending dateof the Extended Benefit Period, whichever is appropriate. In the case ofan Extended Benefit Period that is about to begin, the announcement shalldescribe clearly the unemployed individuals who may be eligible for ExtendedBenefits during the period, and in the case of an Extended Benefit Periodthat is about to end, the announcement shall also describe clearly theindividuals whose entitlement to Extended Benefits will be terminated.(c) <T3>Notices to individuals. </T3>(1) Whenever there has been a determinationthat an Extended Benefit Period will begin in a State, the State agencyshall provide prompt written notice of potential entitlement to ExtendedBenefits to each individual who has established a benefit year in the Statethat will not end prior to the beginning of the Extended Benefit Period,and who exhausted all rights under the State law to regular compensationbefore the beginning of the Extended Benefit Period. (2) The State agency shall provide such notice promptly to each individualwho begins to claim sharable regular benefits or who exhausts all rightsunder the State law to regular compensation during an Extended BenefitPeriod, including exhaustion by reason of the expiration of the individual'sbenefit year. (3) The notices required by paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this sectionshall describe those actions required of claimants for sharable regularcompensation and Extended Benefits and those disqualifications which applyto such benefits which are different from those applicable to other claimantsfor regular compensation which is not sharable. (4) Whenever there has been a determination that an Extended Benefit Periodwill end in a State, the State agency shall provide prompt written noticeto each individual who is currently filing claims for Extended Benefitsof the forthcoming end of the Extended Benefit Period and its effect onthe individual's right to Extended Benefits. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 615.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Payments to States. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Sharable compensation. </T3>(1) The Department shall promptly uponreceipt of a State's report of its expenditures for a calendar month reimbursethe State in the amount of the sharable compensation the State is entitledto receive under the Act and this Part.
