The first signs of what will likely be a slow, steadypublic campaign to accept an end to this nation's 48-yearvirtual ban on foreign rice came June 8 when Komeito, anopposition party often allied with the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party, said it would consider supporting partialliberalization of rice trade. On June 13, Noboru Takeshita, aformer prime minister who remains a leading LDP power broker,publicly praised the move as &quot;courageous&quot; and said publicopinion might shift in that direction.</LP><TEXT>   Recent polls have shown strong majorities of the generalpublic backing such a move, reversing the results of similarsurveys from two years ago.   Top elected officials have yet to openly embrace riceimports and most still vehemently oppose it. Last week, fiveLDP Diet members flew to Washington to try and persuade theU.S. to drop its demand. Indeed, the positive butnoncommittal stirrings also come at a time when Japan istrying to navigate through another set of difficult tradenegotiations with the U.S., the Structural ImpedimentsInitiative talks slated to end by early next month. But in anation where shifts in government policy are often carefullychoreographed to create the necessary public opinion, someJapanese and American officials say a change is underway.&quot;People living in urban areas cannot understand why we givesubsidies to the farmers who produce rice,&quot; said a governmentofficial who supports liberalization. &quot;We should educateJapanese public opinion to get back to normalcy&quot; in acceptingsuch a move. He said a &quot;campaign&quot; would start with &quot;politicalleaders,&quot; and &quot;when the time is right, then we {governmentleaders} can come out.&quot; He added that &quot;perhaps Mr.Takeshita's remarks&quot; were the beginning of the drive.   An American Embassy official asserted Friday: &quot;Thedecision's been made for quite some time. The Japaneseunderstand that they're big players in the world tradeenvironment and they're in an untenable position in insistingon a total import embargo.&quot;   The Japanese government's official policy, submitted inthe ongoing multilateral Uruguay Round of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, says that a country should beallowed &quot;adjustment measures necessary to maintain itsrequired domestic production level in basic foodstuffs forfood security considerations.&quot; Both the Japanese and Americangovernment officials interviewed said the statement doesn'tnecessarily mean support for a continued import ban.   The U.S. is asking Japan to loosen its rice policy as partof the Uruguay Round, scheduled for completion by the end ofthe year. The U.S. is also pressuring Europe to relaxagricultural trade restrictions, and is offering to do thesame if the other countries comply.   Any change in Japan's policy would likely be symbolic,however, at least at the beginning. Under the U.S. proposal,countries would first convert agricultural quotas to tariffs,then phase them out. According to U.S. calculations, Japan'srice ban is the equivalent of a 700% tariff. If the ban werereplaced with that high a tariff, little rice would beimported.   Under outside pressure, Japan has over the past decadetaken down many of its formal trade restrictions. But theU.S., recognizing the political sensitivity, had refraineduntil the current GATT talks from pushing on rice, even as itpried open Japan's beef and citrus markets two years ago. Atthat time, the Diet endorsed a resolution, backed by all themajor parties, supporting the no-import rice policy.   Japan has justified the protection of its rice farmers aspreserving cherished symbols of its agrarian heritage, and asmaintaining a policy of &quot;food security&quot; for a nation with newnatural resources. Consumers groups, especially housewivesorganizations, have campaigned against rice imports, eventhough it means higher prices. They also argue that foreignrice is unsafe.   (Actually, Japan does allow some importation of rice forcertain rice-based products, like rice crackers. Once,according to one government official, Japan &quot;borrowed&quot; ricefrom Korea during a shortage, then &quot;paid it back&quot; during asurplus period.)   But the reality is that the number of rice farmers isdropping drastically, and many who remain do so simply fortax breaks and government subsidies while holding otherfull-time jobs. In the fiscal year ended March 31, per capitarice consumption dropped 1.6%, the fourth consecutive annualdecline.</TEXT></DOC>
