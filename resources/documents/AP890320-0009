Botha's successor iscontributing to a surge of hope for a peaceful breakthrough in SouthAfrica's political stalemate.   So far, however, the optimistic musings are coming almostexclusively from whites.   Black leaders make clear they will be relieved when Botha stepsdown. But they suspect his heir apparent, F.W. de Klerk, willpreside over changes more cosmetic than substantive.   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu political leader denounced by manyblack activists as too conservative, says he will oppose de Klerkuntil the government gives blacks full voting rights. There is nosign de Klerk contemplates such action.   At the other end of the black political spectrum, the AfricanNational Congress guerrilla movement says changes under de Klerkwill be in personal style, not National Party policy.   De Klerk and Botha ``are pieces of the same carcass,'' spokesmanTom Sebina said from the outlawed movement's exile headquarters inLusaka, Zambia. ``If the meat is bad, the meat is bad.''   Botha, 73, resumed his presidential duties last week after aneight-week convalescence from a stroke. In the interim, he resignedas National Party leader and was replaced by de Klerk, the ministerof national education.   In a dramatic chain of events, Nationalist newspapers andpoliticians began suggesting that Botha should retire, Botharesponded by declaring he would stay in office until next year, andthe party's parliamentary caucus resolved that it wanted de Klerk tobe president.   However, the party has neither the constitutional power nor theappetite to force Botha from office. De Klerk said Friday he willseek cordial coexistence with the president while urging his partyto ``break new ground'' in pursuing political reform.   De Klerk, who turned 53 Saturday, has never been viewed asliberal. But supporters and skeptics alike depict him as moreopen-minded and less imperious than Botha, who has headed thegovernment since 1978.   After becoming party leader, de Klerk called for a South Africa``free of domination and oppression.'' Other party officials say atleast some remaining apartheid laws _ those segregating residentialareas and public facilities _ may be modified.   Helen Suzman, long-serving legislator for the anti-apartheidProgressive Federal Party, said of de Klerk: ``People are being toooptimistic if they think he is going to throw fundamental policyoverboard.''   ``But I think he's pragmatic and intelligent,'' she said. ``Herealizes that change is absolutely inevitable, that the sooner weget on with it, the more chance there is that change and reform willbe accomplished peacefully.''   De Klerk does not have the same close ties to the military andpolice that Botha nurtured. But he is committed firmly tosegregating neighborhoods and schools for whites who want them, andhis proposal for ``genuine power sharing'' with blacks as yet has nosubstance.   His ascendency coincides with other developments that haveinduced the broadest optimism about South Africa since black unrestbroke out in 1984. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saidlast week ``encouraging changes'' were unfolding in South Africa.   These include major foreign policy initiatives, such asindependence for Namibia and rapprochement with Mozambique afterprolonged hostility. But anti-apartheid leaders view seeminglynotable domestic developments with skepticism. For example, agovernment-appointed law commission attracted internationalpublicity this month by calling for a bill of rights, abolition ofapartheid laws and full voting rights for blacks. Human rightsactivists doubted the proposals would be implemented, and thegovernment reacted with silence.   Similarly, black clergymen were unimpressed when delegates fromthe white Dutch Reformed Church, to which most National Partyofficials belong, issued a statement describing apartheid as a sin.Last week the full policy-making body of the Afrikaner church balkedat endorsing the delegates' stance.   The government spurned recent suggestions by Dutch ReformedChurch leader Johan Heyns and Beeld, a major Afrikaans-languagenewspaper, that it drop its demand the ANC renounce violence beforenegotiations are held. There is no indication jailed ANC leaderNelson Mandela will be freed soon.   One of the most informed assessments of de Klerk came in a recentmagazine article by his brother, Willem, a former newspaper editorwho quit the National Party out of disenchantment with apartheid.   Willem de Klerk described his brother as ``fair, friendly andhumble,'' but committed to the ideology of separating racial groups.   ``If F.W can give the National Party a new credibility among allpopulation groups, and in international politics, he will herald abreakthrough toward a new future. But if he continues along the oldpath, he will merely be a transitional figure who will let us keeptreading water,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
