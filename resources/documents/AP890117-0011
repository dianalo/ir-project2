TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Yasser Arafat's guerrillas have refrained fromattacking Israeli targets for the past two months, observing anundeclared cease-fire that could give credibility to the PLO's peaceinitiative if it endures.   Some Israeli officials have called attention to the lack of Fatahoperations but have expressed doubt about Arafat's ability or evendesire to make it last.   ``We have not identified any flagrant act on the part of the PLOagainst the security zone or Israel since Arafat committed himself''to end terrorism, said Uri Lubrani, a senior Defense Ministryofficial responsible for Lebanon policy.   ``I think it is too early to judge'' if the truce would belasting, Lubrani said on Israel radio.   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alon Liel said in an interview it was``not 100 percent clear'' whether the cease-fire encompassed onlyArafat's own Fatah guerrillas or all Palestine LiberationOrganization factions.   There have been two recent infiltration attempts by Syrian-basedgroups, one headed by Abu Nidal which is outside the PLO umbrellaand the other, the Palestine Liberation Front, which is part of thePLO. Israeli soldiers killed six of the guerrillas.   The last attack by Arafat's Fatah came on the eve of the PLO'sdeclaration of statehood in mid-November when a five-member Fatahsquad took U.N. soldiers and Lebanese civilians hostage for 18hours. The guerrillas shot to death one Lebanese man beforesurrendering.   Anat Kurz, a terrorism expert at Tel Aviv University's JaffeeCenter for Strategic Studies, said in an interview that a cease-firewould have to be more enduring to overcome Israeli suspicion aboutthe PLO.   ``It will change people's mind if it lasts longer,'' she said.   Kurz noted Arafat had never renounced armed struggle or the rightto attack targets in Israel but said it was in Arafat's interest tosuspend anti-Israeli attacks to give his initiative credibility,especially with Western countries.   However, she said there were serious doubts among Israelipolicymakers about whether Fatah could tolerate a long period ofinaction without clear political gains.   The center estimates Fatah has about 8,000 guerrillas, or halfthe total number of Palestinians under arms. Most are based inLebanon.   Many Israelis, especially those on the political right, view the13-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories as a formof terrorism aimed at destroying Israel.   Retired Maj. Gen. Shlomo Gazit, former head of militaryintelligence, said a PLO cease-fire would not be effective indispelling Israeli doubts unless Arafat specified its duration andmade it comprehensive.   ``For Israelis, it doesn't matter which group stands behind anoperation. The question that counts if whether attacks continue,''he said in an interview.   Gazit said the test of Arafat's credibility was whether he waswilling or able to force dissident factions to observe a truce bothin cross-border raids and in violent acts in the occupied West Bankand Gaza Strip.   ``If he can't, then he is no authority we should be talking to,''said Gazit, noting Arafat succeeded in forcing opponents to observea military stand in 1981 along the Israel-Lebanon border.   The de facto truce already has touched off a public quarrelbetween Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the armed forces chief ofstaff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, who appeared to challenge Shamir'spolicy by pointing out the de facto cease-fire.   Shamir described as ``superfluous'' Shomron's report to aparliament committee that Arafat's Fatah and other guerrillas underhis authority had ``in practice halted hostile operations'' as wellas preparations for attacks.   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, confirmed the prime ministerdisagreed with chief of staff over the issue and accused Arafat ofencouraging daily acts of terror.   ``Mr. Shamir believes there is a lot of terrorism by Arafat inthe territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) and Israel proper,'' saidPazner, noting a Fatah cell recently had been uncovered in northernIsrael.   ``There are acts of terrorism daily in the territories andattempts in Israel, and Mr. Arafat encourages those,'' he added.   The hawkish premier has opposed any conciliatory move toward thePLO in response to Arafat's renunciation of terrorism and acceptanceof Israel.   Shamir told the Jerusalem Post on Friday that the PLO sought toreplace Israel and could not be trusted. ``I am sure there are thosewho understand that Israel cannot trust what the PLO says. We knowthem too well,'' he said.   The daily newspaper Davar said security officials told theCabinet this month it was their assessment that certain PLO groupswere liable to attempt to carry out border raids but not under thePLO's name. The purpose of such attacks would be to gauge the U.S.response, it said.   For Israeli doves, Arafat's declarations have been enough totrigger calls for the government to agree to talk to the PLO. Fourmembers of parliament participated in a conference in Paris attendedby PLO members but avoided face-to-face talks because of a 1986Israeli laws outlawing such contacts.   Yossi Sarid, a dovish lawmaker who supports negotiations with thePLO, wrote in the liberal daily Haaretz this week that Arafat'schange of principles was more difficult to achieve than a change inpolicy on attacks.   ``It's generally easier to change the pratical than therhetorical. For Yasser Arafat it is much easlier to stop engaging interror than to announce its end,'' said Sarid.</TEXT></DOC>
