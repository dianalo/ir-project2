Exploring SOL ServerI advocate experimenting with new software, to get a &quot;feel&quot; for it, if youwill.andP;  That way, you'll at least have confidence that the software actuallyworks.andP;  The obvious risk, in the course of your exploration, is that youcould mess something up and have to reinstall the package.andP;  But since theinstallation process will still be fresh in your mind (and since you won't beworrying about losing &quot;live&quot; data), you'll often learn a lot in your baptismby fire.andP;  Most of today's packages provide sample data to satisfy that urgeor to run their tutorial.andP;  SQL Server doesn't come with a tutorial.andP;  That'stoo bad, because it isn't a trivial package to learn.andP;  The manuals allcontain lots of examples that are like tutorials, but there's nothing akin toa Quick Start.&quot; So what kind of documentation do you get for the $2,495price? You'll be pleasantly surprised to find that the SQL Server packageweighs in at a modest 10 pounds and takes up less than five inches of shelfspace.andP;  Your package will include: * SQL Server: Getting Started (25andM;pages) * SQL Server Administrator's Guide (225 pages) * SQL Server QuickReference Guide (83 pages) * SQL Server Language Reference (almost 500 pages)* SQL Server Programmer's Reference (almost 300 pages) * LearningTransact-SQL (about 400 pages) You'll undoubtedly be quite familiar with thecontents of the Installation Guide by the time you finish installing SQLServer.andP;  Although it includes useful tips that help the installation process,it really does little more than point you in the right direction.andP;  Systemadministrators are supposed to tackle the Administrator's Guide first, thengo on to the tutorial-style Learning TransactSQL, and finally on to theLanguage Reference.andP;  (Transact-SQL is Sybase's version of SQL with extensionslike triggers and stored procedures.andP;  Sybase developed SQL Server andlicensed it to Microsoft for development on a PC platform.) Applicationdevelopers and other users&quot; have different assignments.andM;In this article I'll examine the role of the SQL Server system administrator.andM;So what's a system administrator?andM;Strictly speaking, SQL Server's System Administrator (SA) is any individualor group that knows and uses the SA's password to maintain the system.andP;  Inmost organizations, the SA's role is assigned to an individual, with at leastone other person trained in SA tasks.andP;  In large organizations, the SAprobably won't be the same person as the LAN Administrator.andP;  In smallorganizations, the same person may wear these two very different hats.andP;  SAsare sometimes referred to as Database Administrators.andM;According to the Administrator's Guide, the SA's tasks typically consist ofthe following: * SQL Server installation * Storage management * Oversight ofthe Master and * Model databases * User database creation * Assignment ofdatabase ownership * Management of SQL Server accessandM;by individuals and groups * Management of devices * Backup and recovery *Data import and export * Fine tuning for performanceandM;optimization * General troubleshootingandM;Other individuals may be involved with database administration.andP;  Eachdatabase has a database owner, who can-but needn't be-the SA.andP;  Individualswith appropriate permissions can define database &quot;objects.&quot; Since they &quot;own&quot;these structures, they're responsible for assigning permission to view,insert, modify, and/or delete their creations.andP;  This division of labor,common in the mainframe and mini computer database worlds, probably seemsalien to most PC database gurus.andP;  Don't sweat it.andP;  Many of the folks with bigsystems backgrounds aren't that familiar with SQL or the relational model.andO;If you're elected (or drafted) to the SA post, I recommend that youcomplement your background by tapping in-house MIS, data communications(e.g., LANs) and/or PC-based relational database management system experts.andO;Approach your colleagues with a &quot;win-win&quot; proposition.andP;  You offer them acrash course in your area of expertise in exchange for a crash course 4&quot;theirs.andP;  Testing the watersandM;The first chapter of the System Administrator's Guide defines terms, talksabout system tables and databases, and distinguishes between log-in I.D.s andpasswords.andP;  The second chapter tells you about starting and stopping SQLServer.andP;  Both refer tantalizingly to the System Administration Facility andInteractive SQL.andP;  Refer to chapter 2 in the Transact-SQL manual to learn howto use the System Administration Facility.andP;  Interactive SQL is the only&quot;front end&quot; that comes with SQL Server.andP;  You can use it to manipulatedatabases until you purchase or develop a front-end application.andP;  You can loginto SQL Server via the System Administration Facility and issue Transact-SQLcommands.andP;  I recommend using it for your initial exploration into the worldof SQL Server.andP;  Let's assume you have a set-up like this: 3Com'sserver-adapted version of Microsoft OS/2 1.1 installed as PresentationManager; 3+Open LAN Manager in concurrent mode with the loopback driver; andSQL Server installed with the sample database, PUBS.andP;  In other words, OS/2,3+Open, and SQL Server are shoehorned into one box.andP;  (Ifyou need to installor reinstall the PUBS database, see the introduction in the Administrator'sGuide.) When you boot your system, you'll probably see a STARTUP.CMD window.andO;(OS/2 uses the CMD extension for batch files.) In order to better see itscontents, type Alt-Fl0 to maximize the window.andP;  Users with mice may want toselect the unlabeled icon in the upper left corner of the window, pull downthe menu, and select MaXimize.andP;  You should see the OS/2 C:\ prompt.andP;  At thispoint, you've got two choices for starting SQL Server.andP;  Assuming you'vestarted LAN Manager, one is to type: NET START SQLSERVER If you haven'tstarted Lan Manager, type: NET START SERVER This isn't a very excitingoption.andP;  After seeing a few messages confirming the successful serverstart-up, you end up with the OS/2 prompt.andP;  Another way to start SQL Serveris to type: SAF (for System Administration Facility) at the OS/2 prompt.andO;When you start SQL Server this way, you'll have to know the name of yourserver (or the particular network SQL Server you want to log into).andP;  Ifyou've installed LAN Manager, the server name is the same as the LAN servername.andP;  If you're using Novell's OS/2 Requester, the server's name is whateveryou called it in the CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  If you're new to both the OS/2 and LANworlds and you're trying to learn SQL Server, it's easy to get confused withthe names, I.D.s, and passwords associated with everything.andP;  Be sure to keeptrack of them or you'll really be lost.andM;After typing in the name of your server, press the Tab key and enter thelog-in I.D.andP;  for the SA.andP;  Since the SA won't have a password when you firstinstall SQL Server, press Enter to fire up the server.andP;  The Facility will letyou know that SQL Server isn't running.andP;  It'll ask you if you want to startit.andM;If you start SQL Server via NET START SQLSERVER and you're staring at theOS/2 prompt, you can still run the SAF.andP;  However, since SQL Server is alreadystarted, it should appear on the list of available SQL Servers.andP;  You can Tabdown to the &quot;LoginID&quot; prompt.andP;  Type SA and press Enter to skip over thepassword.andP;  Using the FacilityandM;Again, it won't seem like much is happening.andP;  You may hear some seeminglyrandom hard disk access noises-that's just OS/2 doing its multi-tasking.andO;You'll want to explore the SAF, since it's the easiest way to set up SQLServer groups and permissions.andP;  For now though, simply type (in lower case)sp_helpdb and press Ctrl-E to execute the query (or pull down the Query menuand select Execute Query).andP;  &quot;sp-helpdb,&quot; isn't a standard SQL query.andP;  It's aspecial SQL Server system procedure.andP;  A message at the bottom of the screenwill reassure you that the query is being processed.andP;  You should soon seesomething similar to Fig.andP;  1.andM;The answer, in the bottom half of the screen, tells you which databases arestored on your SQL Server.andP;  It should have at least three system databases:Master (a data repository or data dictionary); Model (which serves as atemplate for new databases); and Tempdb (which stores intermediate and/ortemporary results in table form).andP;  If the PUBS database is installed, it'llbe on the list.andP;  Installing SQL Server makes Master the default database.andP;  Soany database-specific queries will get you information about the Masterdatabase.andP;  To change to another database, delete the previous query and type:use andless;dbnameandgt; (i.e.andP;  use PUBS) and press Ctrl-E again.andP;  If you know SQL, youcan try: sp_helpdb PUBS to find out what the database object names are.andP;  Mostbut not all of the objects will be tables that can be queried with standardSQL SELECT commands.andP;  (Sybase uses the term object not in the sense ofobject-oriented database management systems, but to mean database things,items, or-if you prefer-entities.)andM;If you're not the only person logged into SQL Server, it's fun to execute ansp_who system procedure (see Fig.andP;  2).andP;  This charts the activity of differentSQL Server processes.andP;  Refer to chapter 2 in the Transact-SQL manual forinstructions on using the SAF.andM;There are more than 20 system procedures like sp_helpdb and sp_who.andP;  Thefirst three characters of all of them are sp_.andP;  If you look in chapter 3 ofthe Language Reference manual, you'll find commented examples of how to usethem.andP;  The Quick Reference Guide provides syntax diagrams.andP;  Notice that someof the system procedures (such as sp_addgroup andless;grpnameandgt;) let you docommand-level administrative tasks like setting up groups.andM;An alternate way to do these chores is via the SAF.andP;  For example, if youselect: Manage User NamesandM;from the Facility's Admin menu, you'll be able to find out what user nameshave been established for the available databases.andP;  Things that merit yourimmediate attentionandM;Don't forget to read the section at the end of the pamphlet called&quot;Performance Issues.&quot; This will introduce you to configuration tasksassociated with SQL Server and OS/2 and LAN Manager.andP;  NetWare LAN users maywant to share their configuration tips via NetWire on CompuServe or throughMicrosoft's On-Line (see my January article).andM;Decisions about memory, caching, connections, and so on, will greatly affectSQL Server performance.andM;As SA, you should also establish a password for the SA log-on I.D.-to preventunauthorized SQL Server access.andP;  Obviously, take the normal precautions toremember your password.andP;  Managing database accessandM;Managing database access is quite similar to managing SQL Server access, anddatabase owners are responsible for establishing read, write, and modifyaccess to different tables in their databases.andP;  They use the SQL GRANTcommand to do this.andP;  The SA may also give database owners the task of settingup groups and their associated user names for their databases.andP;  Remember, noone has access to a database other than the owner, unless authorized by theowner.andP;  I recommend that you limit your explorations of user names and groupnames to the PUBS database until you're familiar with SA tasks.andP;  If youdamage the Master, Model, or PUBS databases, SQL Server comes with scripts(SQL Server's equivalent of batch files) to recreate them.andP;  The scriptsshould be in the INSTALL subdirectory with names like BLDMSTR.SQL.andP;  These arenot executable files-you have to have SQL Server up and running to use them.andO;You'll also want to learn about Interactive SQL.andP;  Shutting down the serverandM;Unfortunately, there's an irritating bug in SQL Server 1.0 that causes you tosee disturbing error messages if you shut SQL Server down via the SAF Configmenu or from OS/2 via NET STOP SQLSERVER.andP;  Ignore the OS/2 messages abutSAF.EXE-caused protection errors.andP;  interactive SOL: another nifty utilityandM;You'll want to learn Interactive SQL (ISQL) to avoid receiving thoseworrisome OS/2 error messages.andP;  From ISQL you can execute the commandsequence: 1andgt; shutdown 2andgt; go to shut down the server without OS/2 complaining.andO;ISQL won't impress you if you're from the microcomputer world, butmainframers will probably love it.andP;  Unless you use Microsoft's embeddededitor, you can't edit any of your queries-you'll have to retype them.andP;  Sowhat does ISQL look like, and how do you start it? Type its name at the OS/2prompt.andP;  If you're in the SAF, you may want to close that process and startanother one for ISQL.andP;  You can run system procedures from ISQL as well as theFacility query window (see Fig.andP;  3).andP;  As you become more familiar with SQLServer and get your front ends running, you probably won't have to use theSAF or ISQL much, but exploring them is an excellent way to get a feel forthis exciting database server product.andP;  Database and referential integrityMost SAs will also want to be involved with database owner issues involvingdatabase and referential integrity.andP;  There are two basic approaches:establishing integrity constraints while defining the database; and usingsomething Sybase calls &quot;stored procedures&quot; and &quot;triggers.&quot;andM;IBM chose to go the former route with DB2.andP;  For example, A SQL CREATE TABLEcommand might be filled with clauses establishing primary or foreign keys.andO;Sybase's Transact-SQL doesn't include those integrity clauses in its SQLsyntax-you enforce integrity by writing simple programs and saving them astriggers or procedures.andP;  You then bind them to your database (see RussellBozian's accompanying article).andP;  (Debates about the relative merits of thetwo approaches generate heated discussions in certain company-the jury'sstill out on which is better.andP;  Stay tuned for developments as the databaseserver market matures.) Wrap up Entire books could be written to address SQLServer system administration, so don't think that you've learned all you needto know about SA functions by reading this article.andP;  My goal was to conveythe flavor of the job.andP;  Next time we'll take brief looks at some of the frontends that make SQL Server close to an off-the-shelf solution for diversebusiness needs.andP;  Karen Watterson is on sabbatical from her normal teachingduties at Shoreline Community College in Seattle.andP;  Her current interestsinclude database servers, CASE, and expert system technology.andP;  You can reachKaren through SCC, 161 01 Greenwood Avenue North, Seattie, Wash.andP;  98133 orvia MCI Mail (KWATTERSON).andM;Last year, when Kent Johnson, Chief Operating Officer of Seattlebased BrazierForest Industries, Inc., called on his old friend Don Nilson to do someconsulting for him, neither could have guessed the outcome.andP;  Nilson, then anindependent consultant, now wears two hats at Brazier-he's both CorporateController and Director of Information Systems.andP;  Indeed, the match seemsperfect; Nilson served 14 years in the public accounting field, mainly as anauditor, and is a CPA in Colorado, Illinois, and Washington.andP;  After obtaininga Masters degree in Information Systems, however, Nilson's focus shifted tocomputers, and databases in particular.andP;  Johnson hired Nilson at Microrim,where in 1986 Nilson was Microrim's Director of Future Product Technology.andO;Nilson recalls that year as &quot;the most fun time I've had at work.&quot; He was partof Microrim's own think tank and explored ideas like the semantic data model.andO;Similar to the object-oriented approach, the semantic data model stresses theimportance (in the database design process) of capturing the meaning of datafrom the user's point of view.andM;When Nilson joined Brazier, he inherited an IBM System 36 and its terminals.andO;Virtually all corporate information processing ran on the System 36.andP;  FromNilson's perspective, it was ideal; he could design a PC-based informationsystem almost from scratch.andP;  Last year Brazier had sales of over $75 million,and Nilson expects sales to close in on $100 million this fiscal year.andO;&quot;Brazier's growth is phenomenal, especially in the overseas market.&quot; saysNilson.andP;  Brazier has three business segments.andP;  The Trading Division, withalmost a dozen workstations, is basically a brokerage that deals in lumber.andO;The Manufacturing Division is responsible for two saw mills and a laminationplant.andP;  The third division consists of a handful of wholesale lumber yards.andO;Nilson, initially surprised at the lack of computer applications at Brazier,discovered that the firm's level of automation was fairly standard for theindustry.andP;  &quot;It's been slow to automate,&quot; says Nilson.andP;  OS/2 plansandM;Nilson decided the Trading Floor, where sales are made, should receive toppriority.andP;  &quot;They're really dealing in information,' continues Nilson.andO;There's a saying at Brazier: &quot;Give me your dogs.' Dogs refer to slow-movingproducts.andP;  Since one man's dog is always another man's gold, the trick isfinding the right match of buyer and seller.andP;  And that means keeping trackboth of customers and their needs and of mills and their products.andP;  Soundslike a database, eh? Downsizing to increase productivityandM;SQL Server was shipping when Nilson joined Brazier, and he envisionedmigrating applications from the System 36 to PCs.andP;  &quot;We standardized on AST386s running Windows 386.&quot; Even terminal emulation for System 36 access runsunder Windows.andP;  Ideally, the user never sees the DOS prompt.andP;  Under Windows386, users become familiar with multitasking and a graphical environment.andO;&quot;This puts us in a good position to migrate to [OS/2's PresentationManager],&quot; says Nilson.andP;  &quot;My only complaint now is that the VGA driver inWindows 386 takes too much memory.&quot; Brazier's brokers understand that the newsystem will allow them to do a lot more than the current data entry system.andO;Instead of having them simply record sales, the brokers will be able to querythe customers/mills/inventory database to find good fits.andP;  They should beable to create sales, not just record them.andP;  Pilot projectandM;So while users are getting used to PCs and learning to use them for their owndata analysis, Nilson and his team are experimenting with SQL Server runningon 3Com's 3+Open LAN.andP;  Did he have any reservations about going with the LANManager-based network rather than industry leader Novell? &quot;None at all,&quot;Nilson says, &quot;but then I've always been a maverick.&quot; Was he going to considerany other database servers? No.andP;  He felt philosophically close to thedesigners of the Sybase engine.andP;  Lots of the features Nilson and fellowMicrorim researchers had detailed as desirable specifications back in 1986are implemented in SQL Server.andP;  Nilson is also impressed with Sybase's designfocus on transaction processing.andP;  He feels it shows Sybase's basicunderstanding of business needs.andP;  He really doesn't feel much risk in beingan early SQL Server adopter.andP;  Nilson's convinced that the future of SQLServer is in the hands of companies with enough capital to ensure itsevolution.andP;  Sure, Nilson wishes there were more front ends.andP;  But by combiningavailable object-oriented front ends Object/l or Smalltalk (anobject-oriented programming lang-uage) with the SQL Server back end, Nilsonis guiding the development of Brazier's new information system.andP;  Meanwhile,the System 36 is &quot;sort of our artificial heart, or the corporate respirator.andO;We don't dare unplug it; we're co-existing with it.&quot;-Karen WattersonandM;Microsoft's Todd Needham is in charge of helping Independent Software Vendors(ISVs) develop front ends or marketable tools for SQL Server.andP;  Recently, Igave a list of shipping front ends.andP;  At press time, Needham indicated that hehad 121 ISVs.andP;  The list of announced front ends is beginning to look like aPC software &quot;Who's Who-Paradox, dASE IV, DataEase, Nomad, Revelation, Lotus1-2-3, and Clipper probably being the most widely recognized.andP;  Below areadditional, recently-announced front ends.andP;  Lotus Corp.'s DataLens DeveloperToolkit is shipping and will give you the tools to create your own interfacebetween Lotus 1-2-3 and SQL Server (or anything else).andP;  You'll be reinventingthe wheel, though, if you purchase the $250 toolkit to allow Lotus and SQLServer to communicate.andP;  Lotus is doing it themselves.andP;  You might start bycalling around; perhaps Lotus will let you have an early version of theirpatch.andP;  To order the DataLens Developer Toolkit, call (800) 345-1043.andO;Matesys has developed a SQL Server front end, called Object View, that runsunder Windows.andP;  Matesys' product, as its name implies, takes advantage ofobject-oriented technology and provides users with an impressive set ofgraphical tools with which to build data entry or data query screens.andP;  Thetools allow users to implement features like buttons or scrollable windowsand to establish validation and checking triggers.andP;  Object View is scheduledto ship in May. Matesys is based in France but has an office in Washington,D.C., (202) 785-5135.andP;  If you prefer to speak with Matesys principals, you'llprobably have better luck calling France at (33-1) 47.52.19.12.andP;  (The periodsare widely used as separators in European phone numbers.) AlthoughMicrosoft's Excel for OS/2 isn't shipped SQL Server-ready, a  patch&quot;(actually an Excel macro) developed by Kyle Geiger at Microsoft is availablethrough the Northwest SQL Server User's Group, (206) 391-5099.andP;  StrategicTechnologies Group announced SQL Commander, a DOS- or Windows-based front endthat allows end users to point-and-shoot objects for database retrieval.andP;  Notshipping at press time.andP;  For more information, call the Richmond-based firmat (804) 264-7311.-Karen Watterson</TEXT></DOC>
