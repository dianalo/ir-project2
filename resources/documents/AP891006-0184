(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of the country's largest advertisingagencies was indicted Friday on charges it paid nearly $1 millionin bribes over five years to obtain and keep the Jamaican TouristBoard's ad account.   A federal grand jury on Friday returned the 43-page indictmentagainst Young andamp; Rubicam, three of its current or former executivesand two former Jamaican officials, said U.S. Attorney Stanley A.Twardy.   The indictment alleges that starting in 1981 and continuing forthe next 5{ years, two Young andamp; Rubicam executives funneled paymentsthrough Arnold Foote Jr., a Jamaican businessman, to Eric AnthonyAbrahams, who was Jamaica's Minister of Tourism at the time.   Both Foote and Abrahams were charged with racketeering. Twardysaid his office, working with the U.S. State Department, will seektheir extradition.   Young andamp; Rubicam, along with executive Arthur R. Klein and formerexecutive Thomas Spangenberg, were charged with racketeering andconspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Steven M.McKenna, another Yandamp;R executive, was charged with perjury.   The New York-based agency, which developed the ``Come back toJamaica'' ad campaign and still holds the account, denied anyimpropriety.   ``We are shocked and dismayed by this move. We believe theseallegations are based on speculation and innuendo and are withoutsubstance or merit,'' Young andamp; Rubicam said in a 2{-page statementFriday.   The company, with annual billings of more than $5 billion, isthe largest privately held advertising firm in the country. Itsclients include Kraft General Food, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Colgateand Dr. Pepper.   The Jamaica account is relatively small. Twardy said it amountedto $29 million over five years, and the company said Friday itrepresents less than one one-thousandth of the company's worldwidebillings.   Federal prosecutors opened the investigation in 1986 afterreading diaries seized from author Robin Moore, formerly ofWestport, Conn., during an investigation into phony tax shelters,Twardy said.   Moore, author of best-sellers such as ``The Green Berets'' and``The French Connection,'' pleaded guilty in 1986 to unrelated taxcharges and cooperated fully in the Young andamp; Rubicam investigation,Twardy said.   Twardy said Moore, who has business interests in Jamaica datingback 40 years, was an ``essential go-between, a middleman'' whoknew about the scheme and profited from it. He will not be charged,Twardy said.   ``He was forthcoming as to his knowledge of all illegalactivities, including this one,'' Twardy said.   Twardy said the kickback scheme took shape shortly afterAbrahams became tourism minister. According to the indictment,Abrahams summoned an advertising executive to his office and askedhim how the previous administration had handled kickbacks. Whentold there had been none, Abrahams responded, ``Things may bedifferent in the new administration,'' the indictment said.   According to the indictment, Moore and an associate, FrederickSturges, set up the initial meetings between the Jamaicans andYoung andamp; Rubicam executives.   Twardy said the company agreed to take the account for a 15percent commission _ 2 percent more than the Jamaican governmenthad previously paid _ agreeing at the same time to kick backone-third of the commission to Abrahams and Foote.   Most of the alleged payoffs were routed through a ``shamadvertising firm'' set up by Foote that had secret Caribbean bankaccounts, Twardy said.   Foote is described in the indictment as a prominent citizen withclose political ties to the administration of Prime Minister EdwardSeaga, who took office in 1980.   The indictment does not trace any of the money directly toAbrahams, who was tourism minister from 1980 to 1985 and was amember of the Jamaican Parliament from 1980 to 1986. Asked if theinvestigation had done so, Twardy responded, ``We can trace it, butit's not in the indictment, and it's not appropriate for me tocomment on it.''   At the time of the alleged offenses, Klein was an executive vicepresident, Spangenberg was a vice president, and McKenna was asenior vice president. One of the three, Spangenberg, is no longerwith the company, Twardy said.   In its statement, the company also said that Foote and Abrahamsboth steadfastly denied that money from Young andamp; Rubicam wentthrough Foote's company to Abrahams.   The company said it conducted its own internal investigation andfound no illegal acts.   If convicted on all counts, Klein and Spangenberg face up to 25years in jail and fines of up to $500,000, Twardy said. McKennafaces up to five years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000. Youngandamp; Rubicam faces up to $1 million in fines, and forfeiture of about$3.75 million it made from the Jamaican contract.   Abrahams and Foote both face 20 years and up to $250,000 infines.</TEXT></DOC>
