The claim came in a Khmer Rouge radio broadcast in whichguerrilla Commander-in-Chief Son Sen reported on fighting fromOctober 1987 to April 1988, the region's dry season. A text of thebroadcast was obtained today.   The communist Khmer Rouge, with about 30,000 guerrillas, is thestrongest of three groups opposing Vietnam's 9-year-old occupationof Cambodia. Khmer Rouge claims are widely regarded as exaggerated.   In the broadcast, a text of which was obtained today, theguerrillas claimed they killed 11,200 Vietnamese soldiers and``repeatedly attacked and dismantled or dispersed the Vietnameseadministrative networks in 4,033 villages and 236 communes andattacked 23 townships and seven district towns.''   Vietnam responded by transferring an important part of itstroops from the western battlefields bordering Thailand _ thetraditional area of fighting _ to the interior for village defense,the broadcast said.   That allowed the Khmer Rouge, who are based along the Thaiborder, to infiltrate more men into the interior, it said.   ``Therefore, the Vietnamese enemy's strategy to seal off thewestern border of Cambodia and prevent the (Khmer Rouge) fromattacking it inside Cambodia suffered a total setback,'' thebroadcast said.   A coalition of three Cambodian groups is fighting to drive outthe Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in 1979 to drive out the KhmerRouge. The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of peopleduring their 1975-79 reign of terror.   The United States had assisted the republican side against theKhmer Rouge during the 1973-75 civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
