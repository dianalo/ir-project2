The difficulties weencountered in evaluating authoring systems prompted several recommendationsfor vendors to include in their packages. These recommendations includeallowing the prospective customer to actually use the system, providinginformation on instructional strategies and sequences that can be achievedwith the system, and expanding the information provided on computer-managedinstruction (CMI) capabilities and applications. The paper does not includeany reference to specific vendors or systems, for the purpose is to increaseawareness of a specific problem in the field. 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
