The company said the asset write-down will result in a loss for the fourth quarter and the year.    The company didn't specify the size of the losses. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, it earned $17.2 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenue of $573.7 million. It posted 1985 net income of $79.9 million, or $2.25 a share, on revenue of $2.24 billion.    The write-down includes a previously announced $125 million charge in the quarter to be taken by its Ocean Drilling andamp; Exploration Co. unit. Murphy owns 61% of the New Orleans-based Ocean unit.    In addition, the company will charge off $28 million for a reduction in the book value of Ocean and $77 million to reflect a decline in other oil and natural gas reserves, leases and production facilities not included in the Ocean unit.    The company said the write-down included facilities of the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port and Camline, a pipeline connected to the port.    Murphy stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape at $25.625 a share, up 37.5 cents.    Separately, Murphy Oil's 77%-owned Canadian oil and natural gas unit said it expects to take an after-tax fourth-quarter charge of about $23 million (Canadian).    The Canadian unit, Murphy Oil Co. of Calgary, Alberta, said the charge relates to a write-down of certain assets because of the drop in crude oil prices. The charge, equivalent to about $16.8 million U.S., is subject to review by the unit's board and by auditors. </TEXT></DOC>
