The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineeredtobacco plants does not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant pest and also will not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact,the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 406, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Sally L.

The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).E.I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc., of Wilmington, Delaware, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of geneticallyengineered tobacco plants modified to contain an extra gene for endochitinase.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impactto the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under the conditionsdescribed in the E.I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc., application.APHIS concluded that the field testing will not present a risk of plantpest introduction or dissemination and will also not have any significantimpact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by E. I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc.,as well as a review of other relevant literature, provides the public withdocumentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impactsassociated with conducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment. 1. A gene for endochitinase has been inserted into the tobacco chromosome.The increased production of endochitinase may make these plants less susceptibleto the damaging effects of certain fungal pathogens. In nature, the geneticmaterial contained in a plant chromosome can only be transferred to anothersexually compatible plant by cross-pollination. In this field test, theintroduced gene cannot spread to any other sexually compatible plant bycross-pollination since the plants will be harvested before flowering andany flower buds that do form will be removed before they open.2. Neither the endochitinase gene nor its enzyme product confers on tobaccoany plant pest characteristics. The increased production of chitinase inthese tobacco plants does not increase characteristics such as weediness.Tobacco already contains a naturally occurring gene for endochitinase.3. The bean variety from which the endochitinase gene was obtained is nota plant pest.4. The endochitinase gene may provide the genetically engineered tobaccoplants with a selective advantage over nongenetically engineered tobaccoplants in its ability to become established in the environment due to apossible increase resistance to fungal pathogens. Because the geneticallyengineered tobacco will not be allowed to flower or survive, any selectiveadvantages gained by the genetically engineered tobacco plants are notof concern in this field test.5. The vector used to transfer the endochitinase gene into the tabaccochromosome has been evaluated for its use in this experiment. The vector,although derived from a plasmid with known plant pathogenic potential,has een disarmed; that is, genes which are necessary to confer plant pathogenictraits have been removed from the vector. The Vector has been tested andshown to be nonpathogenic to susceptible plants.6. The vector agent, the bacterium which was used to deliver the vectorthat carries the endochitinase gene into the tobacco plant cell, was eliminatedand is no longer associated with transformed plants.7. Horizontal movement of genetic material after insertion into a plantgenome has not been demonstrated. The vector acts by delivering the geneto the chromosomal DNA. The vector does not survive in a transformed plant.No mechanism is known to exist in nature to horizontally move an insertedgene from the chromosome of a plant to any other organism.8. Endochitinase is an enzyme with ability to degrade structural componentsof fungi, nematodes, and certain insects. It has no reported mammaliantoxicity.9. The size of the field test plot is small (66 feet by 66 feet). The plotwill be located on a private research farm and will have good security.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental; Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 18th day of November 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
