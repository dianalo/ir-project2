WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Supporters of a bill guaranteeing unpaid timeoff for workers in family emergencies cited President Bush's own1988 campaign rhetoric Wednesday, saying he supported provisions inan election year that he now threatens to veto.   The House began debating the family and medical leave bill, witha vote scheduled for Thursday.   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., a liberal Republican who supports thebill, quoted Bush from a September 1988 campaign appearance inwhich he said the presidential candidate seemed to be supportingjust such a measure.   Bush, Green said, told a Republican women's group: ``We need toassure that women don't have to worry about getting their jobs backafter having a child or caring for a child during a seriousillness. That is what I mean when I talk about a gentler nation.''   Bush's press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said a day earlier thatBush would veto the bill if passed, and that while Bush urgedemployers to offer guaranteed job-protected leave, he opposed anybill requiring periods of leave.   ``Let me note he used the word `assure,''' Green said, referringto Bush's campaign speech. ``He didn't say we should urge employersto do it. ... The only way we can do that is by legislation.''   The bill would require businesses with 50 or more employees tooffer unpaid time off for the care of newborn, newly adopted orseriously ill children, as well as to deal with personal healthproblems or ill spouses or parents.   House opponents of the bill charged it would be too costly andburdensome for businesses.   Rep. James Quillen, R-Tenn., said it would reduce employers'flexibility in offering benefits to employees.   ``This bill will do serious damage to many small businesses andmedium-sized businesses,'' Quillen said.   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., charged his own party's leaders wereusing ``unfair and heavy-handed'' tactics and trying to ram thebill through without permitting moderate amendments.   The family leave bill is the second of two major social issuesthat the White House has threatened to veto this year. A conferencecommittee has been named to work out House and Senate differenceson a broader bill providing designed to help families find andafford child care, which also is under a veto threat.   Under the bill sent to the House floor, employers would have tooffer up to 18 weeks of unpaid family leave over a two-year periodand up to 15 weeks a year for a sick worker. A proposed substitutebacked by the bill's bipartisan supporters and expected to beadopted would change that to 12 weeks in both cases.   Under the bill, an employee returning from leave must berestored to his or her previous job or an equivalent position.Employers would have to continue health insurance benefits forthose on leave.   Women's groups supporting the bill contend that workers,particularly women, suffer substantial earnings losses after thebirth of a child or during illnesses because many can't return totheir jobs at the same pay.   Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, opposedthe bill. They charged it would be a costly burden for employers,hurting productivity. Although the bill requires employers to offeronly unpaid leave, some opponents were concerned it could lead tolater legislation requiring paid leave or other benefits.   The presidential veto threat was backed up in a formal``statement of administration policy'' sent to Congress by theOffice of Management and Budget, saying the administration``strongly opposes'' the bill.   ``If this or any other mandated leave legislation were presentedto the president, his senior advisers would recommend that it bevetoed,'' the statement said.   It said the bill would ``induce employers to reduce overallemployee benefits'' because of the expense of the new requirement.</TEXT></DOC>
