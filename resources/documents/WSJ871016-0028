But other major banks left their rates unchanged.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, bond prices went on a wild ride yesterday, winding up down once again amid confusion about whether the Federal Reserve will tighten credit further.    Actively traded long-term Treasury bonds fell more than a half-point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 10.23%, the highest since late 1985. That was up from 10.16% Wednesday and only 7 1/2% in March. In early trading in Tokyo Friday, yields advanced even further, rising slightly above 10 1/4% as prices dropped an additional three-eighths of a point.    Corporate and municipal bond prices also fell in New York trading yesterday, and two large new state and local government issues were postponed because of frenetic market conditions. &quot;It was a crazy day in all the markets,&quot; said Michael Snow, senior vice president of Union Bank of Switzerland.    Home mortgage rates also have surged. The average rate on 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgages this week rose to more than 11.4% from 11.3% last week and 11.21% the previous week, according to a national survey by HSH Associates, a Riverdale, N.J.-based publisher of mortgage market information. As recently as the end of March, mortgage rates stood at 9.09%, said Paul Haveman of HSH Associates.    Chemical said its prime rate increase &quot;is fully justified in view of recent increases in open market rates in general.&quot; The bank's parent, Chemical New York Corp., the nation's fourth-largest bank holding company, earlier this week reported a quarterly loss associated with the elimination of 2,100 jobs at Chemical Bank.    Asked if the bank's speed in raising its prime rate was connected in any way with its dismal quarterly results, a Chemical spokesman said the reason for the change was &quot;market rates,&quot; not the company's third-quarter loss.    Some analysts predict other banks soon will match Chemical's increase in its prime, or base, rate on corporate loans. They contend that a higher prime rate is inevitable because of recent surges in banks' own borrowing costs, such as the federal funds rate and rates on bank certificates of deposit.    The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged nearly 7 3/4% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up from an average of 7.59% in the week ended Wednesday and 7.43% the previous week. One analyst speculated that other banks may be waiting until today to raise their prime rates because Friday moves often attract less publicity.    Banks use the prime as a base rate on loans to many small and medium-size businesses. They also use it as a benchmark on the increasingly popular home-equity loans that have attracted many consumers. But the nation's largest companies don't have to worry about the prime rate. Because these companies have access to alternative sources of credit, such as the commercial paper market, banks routinely offer them rates well below prime.    Uncertainty about what the Federal Reserve's next move will be roiled the bond markets yesterday. Some analysts predict the Fed will raise its discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, within a few weeks to demonstrate its determination to combat inflation. But others say remarks yesterday by Fed and Treasury officials have muddied the outlook, and some forecasters insist it would be a mistake for the Fed to tighten credit again.    &quot;The Fed doesn't need to do anything further right now, and it shouldn't do anything further,&quot; said Raymond W. Stone of Merrill Lynch. &quot;The economic fundamentals don't warrant any change. There would be no useful purpose to a hike in the discount rate.&quot;    Mr. Stone also contended that Chemical Bank's prime rate increase was &quot;premature,&quot; but he predicted other banks eventually will follow suit.    The Fed yesterday helped quash speculation of an imminent discount rate increase when it moved aggressively to inject funds into the banking system by arranging overnight repurchase agreements for its own account. At the time, the federal funds rate was trading at about 7 3/4%.    The Fed action came nearly an hour before it usually intervenes in the market, which analysts interpreted as a strong signal that the Fed won't push short-term rates any higher imminently. Several observers predicted that the federal funds rate soon will drift back down to about the 7 1/2% level. Nevertheless, some remain convinced the Fed will raise its discount rate within a few weeks to 6 1/2% from the current level of 6%.    In the bond market yesterday, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds, which fell 25.23 points Wednesday, fell another 8.18 to close at 1122.98. It ranged between 1111.00 and 1135.31.    That was the lowest closing level on the Shearson index since Oct. 28, 1985. Since the end of last year, the index has tumbled more than 280 points, a decline of about 20%.    Among actively traded issues, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to 87 14/32 from 88 Wednesday. At one point early yesterday, they traded as low as 86 10/32 to yield about 10.36%.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell slightly to 90 3/32 from 90 12/32, raising the yield to 10.24% from 10.19%.    Rates were mixed on short-term Treasury bills. The latest Treasury bill rate fell to 7.04% bid from 7.17% Wednesday, but the latest six-month Treasury bill rate rose to 7.66% bid from 7.59%.    In the new issue sector, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets offered $100 million of Province of Newfoundland debentures due Oct. 15, 2007. The 11 5/8% debentures, which are noncallable, were priced at par, which was 1.3 percentage points above comparable Treasury bonds. The issue is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    New issue activity elsewhere has been very light, reflecting the market's wild swings this week. In the municipal market yesterday, the state of Hawaii rejected bids from underwriters on a proposed $80 million bond issue.    Also, a proposed $110 million issue of housing mortgage finance program bonds by the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority has been postponed, according to a spokesman for Shearson Lehman. A Shearson spokesman said the reason for the postponement was &quot;market conditions.&quot;    A few companies, though, have launched new debt issues this week. For example, Heller Financial Inc. sold $150 million of senior subordinated notes due in three years. The 10% notes, which are noncallable, were priced Tuesday at 99.89 to yield 10.042%. Salomon Brothers headed the underwriters. Late yesterday, the issue was quoted by some dealers in the secondary market at a price of around 99 bid.    Separately, Security Pacific Corp. sold $150 million of notes due Nov. 1, 1989. The 9.55% notes were priced Wednesday at 99.954 to yield 9.575%. </TEXT></DOC>
