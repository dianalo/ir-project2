This invention isto increase an effective light receiving area by forming two or moreprimary electrodes on an insulated substrate, then after these primaryelectrodes are totally coated with an amorphous semiconductor layer,connecting openings which penetrate the above amorphous semiconductorlayer to the primary electrodes are made by irradiation of laser, followedby forming two or more secondary electrodes on the amorphous semiconductorlayer so that the electromotive force of each electricity generatingsector may be derived in series. In addition, since amorphous semiconductorcoating is done without mask, instabilization of membranes due to theinterference between the mask and plasma can be avoided, consequentlyan amorphous semiconductor layer with stable membranes which has an excellentappearance and quality can be obtained.
