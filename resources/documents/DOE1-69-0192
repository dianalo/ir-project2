Until August 1987, the 216-A-36Bcrib, located in the 200-East Area of the Hanford Site, accepted ammoniatedwater discharges. Although this study addresses known hazardous chemicalconstituents associated with such discharges, the primary concern isthe discharge of NH{sub 4}OH because of its microbiological conversionto NO{sub 2}{sup {minus}} and NO{sub 3}{sup {minus}}. As a result offuel decladding operations, material balance calculations indicate thatNH{sub 4}OH has been discharged to the 216-A-36B crib in amounts thatexceed reportable quantities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Although flow to the crib isrelatively constant, the estimated NH{sub 4}OH discharge varies fromnegligible to a maximum of 10,000 g-moles/h. Because these dischargesare intermittent, the concentration delivered to the groundwater is afunction of soil sorption, microbiological conversion rates of NH{sub4}{sup +} to NO{sub 2}{sup {minus}} and NO{sub 3}{sup {minus}}, and groundwaterdispersion. This report provides results based on the assumptions ofmaximum, nominal, and discountinued NH{sub 4}OH discharges to the crib.Consequently, the results show maximum and realistic estimates of NH{sub4}{sup +}, NO{sub 2}{sup {minus}} and NO{sub 3}{sup {minus}} concentrationsin the groundwater.</TEXT></DOC>
