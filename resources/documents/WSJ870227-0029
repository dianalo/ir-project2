But the White House is uncertain about how to revise its national security apparatus or shore up the president's flagging leadership.    Avoiding reporters' questions, Mr. Reagan promised to &quot;read and digest&quot; the report, which was replete with embarrassing findings about his administration's conduct of foreign policy. Although the report has been anticipated for weeks, the White House has charted no strategy for responding to the criticisms.    The chief problem appears to be that Mr. Reagan still hasn't decided how to rebuild his senior staff after the expected resignation of Chief of Staff Donald Regan.    The president's first formal response to the report is likely to come next Wednesday, when he plans to deliver what his aides called a &quot;make or break&quot; speech on the issue. The aides said the president likely will admit in the speech for the first time that he personally made mistakes in the affair.    Mr. Reagan plans to meet today with advisers about the turmoil engulfing the administration. Among those expected to consult with the president are his longtime political adviser, Stuart Spencer, who has been campaigning for Mr. Regan's departure, and former Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, who has been mentioned as part of a team that might replace Mr. Regan.    The president also is expected to meet with Republican congressional leaders, to get their suggestions.    Many lawmakers yesterday didn't wait to be consulted, however. Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas was one of a myriad of Republican leaders to call for personnel changes at the White House. &quot;If you don't protect the president, if you don't serve the president well, then you ought to move on,&quot; he said.    Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, urged the president &quot;to get much more involved&quot; in running the White House. &quot;The president was not alert in his own responsibilities,&quot; said Sen. Nunn. &quot;Out of that came a flawed policy.&quot;    Some political advisers are urging the president to institute a massive shake-up of his cabinet -- including dismissing Secretary of State George Shultz, who was criticized in the report for ignoring the Iran arms-sales rather than trying to change the policy.    Yesterday, however, Mr. Shultz told reporters he didn't intend to resign. And some political pros, like Wyoming Rep. Richard Cheney, who was chief of staff to President Gerald Ford, warned that while &quot;some personnel changes are necessary,&quot; too much of an upheaval would &quot;convey a sense of panic.&quot;    Although Mr. Regan's resignation is expected imminently, senior presidential aides said last night a successor or successors hasn't been found. Treasury Secretary James Baker, who formerly held the post, and former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, currently chairman of Union Pacific Corp., have been mentioned as possible candidates. Mr. Baker is said to be reluctant and Mr. Lewis has told the White House he has no interest in serving on a full-time or long-term basis -- a situation two sources say the White House has accepted.    Another idea is to split Mr. Regan's job between Mr. Laxalt and a more hands-on operative, such as former White House Legislative Affairs Director Kenneth Duberstein, Energy Secretary John Herrington, or Charles Price, the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain.    Even though Mr. Regan's departure is expected soon, the chief of staff appears to be controlling the process of writing the speech that the president plans to deliver next week. Mr. Regan took the unusual step of sidestepping the White House speech-writing staff, asking London Parvin, an outsider to the administration who has written speeches and jokes for Mr. Regan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, to write the speech instead.    Some inside the White House complain that the president's last two major addresses -- the State of the Union address and his November address on the Iran-Contra affair -- were ineffective. But some White House staffers worry that Mr. Regan might influence the speech to pay tribute to his own management of the White House -- a possibility one aide said &quot;would be catastrophic . . . it would overshadow our last chance to start anew.&quot;    White House aides acknowledged that they were too disorganized to design a broader strategy for dealing with the administration's difficulties. Some proposed getting the president out on the road to make speeches about competitiveness and welfare reform, while others suggested Mr. Reagan pick some fights with Congress -- possibly over aid to the Contras or a suggestion by some House Democrats to abandon the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets.    Mr. Regan was unavailable for comment, and no other White House officials would comment publicly about the report.    One Regan aide, who asked not to be identified, tried to put a good face on the situation. He said President Reagan had &quot;benefited significantly&quot; from the report. &quot;The president has undergone elective surgery twice this year: one operation was medical (for an enlarged prostate gland), one was political,&quot; the aide said. &quot;Although both were painful, both were necessary for a full recovery.&quot;    ---   David Shribman contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
