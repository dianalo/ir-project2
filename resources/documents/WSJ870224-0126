In the interest of your readers who need to know the full story, may I request that you publish it in all three newspapers?    The editorial ridiculed the Singapore government's &quot;banana-republic action&quot; in &quot;suppressing&quot; the AWSJ. As a party to the dispute your anger is understandable. But the government is not suppressing the information contained in the AWSJ. It is restricting AWSJ circulation in Singapore. Singapore's 2.6 million citizens lose nothing. In the age of photocopies, reducing AWSJ's circulation from 5,000 to 400 does not deprive 4,600 readers of information. It does deprive the AWSJ of 4,600 copies' worth of sales and advertising, as it is intended to do.    The editorial stated that the AWSJ &quot;has already published a series of letters from officials,&quot; but &quot;self-respecting editors must somewhere draw a line.&quot; These earlier letters had nothing to do with SESDAQ, the proposed second stock exchange in Singapore, and the subject of Mr. Stephen Duthie's article in the AWSJ. As for SESDAQ itself, publication of a letter from the private sector does not justify refusal to publish the views of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).    The editorial studiously avoided any mention of the substance of the dispute. Mr. Duthie's article had made serious allegations about SESDAQ. It claimed that the government had pushed for a new exchange that the economy did not need, and intended to use the new exchange to unload state-controlled and government-backed companies. These are grave charges, which must either be proved or demolished.    Mr. Koh Beng Seng of the MAS wrote two letters to the AWSJ to refute Mr. Duthie's statements. He requested the AWSJ to publish his letters and any rebuttals that it cared to make. The AWSJ refused, and claimed as an excuse that Mr. Koh's first letter had defamed your correspondent. In order to prove that the excuse was groundless the Singapore government has published its letters. Are you not taking legal action?    The editorial contained a long rigmarole about the Singapore government's economic mismanagement, electoral reverses, problems with the opposition, etc. These have nothing to do with the merits of the issue at hand. You can safely leave the Singapore government to sort them out or be destroyed by its own idiocies.    What is relevant is the record of the AWSJ in not telling the whole truth. The editorial cited the contempt-of-court case against the AWSJ in 1985 as an example of the Singapore government becoming &quot;increasingly embroiled with the press.&quot; It was careful to admit that its editors apologized, but still implied that this was another &quot;banana-republic action.&quot;    Why then was it necessary for Robert L. Bartley, editor of The Wall Street Journal, to swear on oath that he would &quot;join with Mr. Zimmerman (editor and publisher of the AWSJ), Mr. Gigot (editorial page editor of the AWSJ) and Ms. Kirkpatrick (features editor for the editorial page of the AWSJ, who wrote the editorial) in expressing our deep regret and sincere apology for any offense the editorial in question has given this honorable court&quot;?    Why did the editorial not report the court's judgment that the AWSJ had made &quot;the outrageous allegation . . . that our courts are not independent, that they do not decide on the evidence, the law and the arguments openly placed before them, and that they are influenced by outside considerations, in particular that the courts can be dictated to by the government&quot;?    Your lawyers knew that you have the right to appeal against this Singapore High Court judgment, all the way up to the Privy Council in London, in order to clear your name and prove your innocence. Why did you choose to apologize, instead of contesting your guilt?    Could it be that you knew that your attacks on the independence of the judiciary in Singapore were baseless? For your Journal now to cite the contempt case as an instance of the Singapore government's repression is disingenuous.    The editorial said, &quot;These actions are a warning not only to the press, but to any business that wants to risk locating in Singapore.&quot; No foreign firm will commit its investment purely based on information provided in the media. Foreign investors in Singapore know that for nearly 29 years the Singapore government has never flinched from an open argument, but has always insisted on its right of rejoinder. This policy has provided stable social and political conditions favorable to business. The government intends to uphold a policy that has served Singapore well. There is no need for sanctimonious editorials to shed crocodile tears over the prospect of Singapore &quot;shrinking to an island backwater.&quot;    The editorial made much of the right to freedom of information, and the right of the press to criticize. Freedom of the press must be a two-way street. It is only fair that a party that has been attacked by a paper be given a right of reply. The AWSJ is entitled to write about us as it pleases, and has done so. Surely we too are entitled to put our points of view as we please. To deny this is to assert double standards. Must we be told how we may write our letters of correction?    It is still not too late to publish all the letters. If you feel right is on your side, why not do so, and let your readers judge who has the better case?    Tommy T.B. Koh   Ambassador of Singapore   Washington   ---   {We're happy to publish Ambassador Koh's letter. Unlike the letters we did not publish, it refrains from personal attacks on our reporter's accuracy and integrity. We would add that, rather than making allegations of his own, Mr. Duthie reported concerns held by members of the Singapore financial community. -- Ed.} </TEXT></DOC>
