Dan Quayle, stumping across Republicanstrongholds in the West, is skewering Michael Dukakis as aMassachusetts liberal out of sync with voters on a host of issuesfrom gun control to taxes to defense.   Quayle today was visiting an irrigation project at a nearbydiversion dam, then holding a rally on the steps of the statecapital before flying on to Las Vegas.   He faced spirited hecklers Monday at a Knoxville stop beforejourneying to Casper, Wyo., and here, but didn't let them interrupthis volley of criticism at Dukakis' defense posture and his recordas governor of Massachusetts.   ``Chicken hawk'' signs and catcalls like those he heard inKnoxville serve as reminders of the controversy over his getting inthe National Guard at the height of the Vietnam war.   But the Indiana senator now has campaigned in 30 states sinceGeorge Bush tapped him as his running mate five weeks ago; Nevadawill be the 31st. He will add a 32nd, Arizona, when he flies thereWednesday before a return visit to California.   His mission, as he told 250 supporters at a rally in Casper onMonday evening, is to ``take a hard look at (Dukakis') record forcompetence and burst his bubble for the voters of America.''   ``The West has a lot of big, open spaces _ just like the Dukakisdefense record,'' Quayle told the Casper crowd.   He laughed as he recalled the sight of a helmet-clad Dukakisriding in a tank last week.   ``In just one week, his defense policy went from generalconfusion to General Patton,'' the Indiana senator said.   He claimed that Dukakis wants to disarm everyone except thepolice and military, and said that while Dukakis ``brags aboutbeing a card-carrying member of the ACLU'' (American CivilLiberties Union), Bush belongs to the National Rifle Association.   He also criticized Dukakis for opposing the death penalty underany circumstances, and said that he let killers out of jail on``weekend junkets'' in Massachusetts.   In Knoxville and Casper, he charged that Dukakis was drivingcitizens away from Massachusetts with high taxes and spending _higher spending per capita than any other state. ``That's not whatyou want to rank first in,'' he said.   He charged that Dukakis ``did not create an economic miracle inMassachusetts. He created an economic manacle.''   Quayle said Massachusetts ranks 40th out of 50 states in totalemployment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth. It actuallylost 90,000 manufacturing jobs between June 1984 and January 1988,he said.   Former Tennessee Sen. and White House chief of staff HowardBaker, who accompanied Quayle to Knoxville, said after theboisterous rally, ``He handled it well. That's the real test of apolitician. The hecklers were few, but they were noisy. He didn'tget angry. ... He made his speech and cast one missile at them andit took. The crowd was with him.''   Quayle conceded that Massachusetts has a low unemployment rate,but said that is because ``people are leaving Massachusetts.''   Quayle said Dukakis ``raised virtually every tax inMassachusetts'' and opposed a statewide proposition that limitedtax increases. When taxes were cut, Quayle said, the creditbelonged to the legislature, not the governor.</TEXT></DOC>
