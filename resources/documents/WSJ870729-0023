Boone Pickens Jr.    But Mr. Pickens isn't saying whether his ultimate goal is to make airplanes or to make money by driving up the company's stock price and selling out. Some Wall Street executives think Boeing could be ripe for a recapitalization.    Boeing stock closed at $53.75 yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the most actively traded Big Board issue, with 3.7% of the company's shares changing hands.    Many analysts speculated that Mr. Pickens is seeking to profit from his Boeing investment either by forcing Boeing into another bidder's arms, or by mounting pressure on the company to disgorge some of its cash hoard -- currently more than $3 billion in cash and liquid investments -- to shareholders.    No other likely bidders stepped forward yesterday. Hostile takeovers are almost unheard of in the defense industry. But analysts have speculated that either Ford Motor Co. or General Electric Co. might be a good fit with Boeing if the companies were interested. Ford, for instance, has indicated it is looking for acquisitions and has accumulated about $9 billion it could use for such purposes. A Ford spokesman, citing company policy, would neither confirm nor deny speculation about its interest. GE declined comment, but a source close to the company said it isn't interested in Boeing.    In any event, a bidder for Boeing could face opposition from the U.S. About 41% of Boeing's revenue is from military programs, including what a Boeing document decribes as &quot;a number of significant classified programs.&quot; The Pentagon would review any transaction for Boeing before it goes through. And Air Force Secretary Edward Aldridge said the Defense Department would oppose on national security grounds any dismantling of significant Boeing military programs.    Meanwhile, speculation surrounding Boeing spread to other defense contractors, many of whose shares also rose on stock exchanges yesterday.    Mesa Limited Partnership, of which Mr. Pickens is general partner, filed notice June 29 of its intention to acquire more than $15 million of Boeing shares. Monday evening, Mesa received permission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act to buy as much as 15% of Boeing's 155.4 million shares outstanding. Boeing itself announced the partnership's filing only late Monday, after its board adopted anti-takeover measures. Boeing didn't make any further comment yesterday.    But persons familiar with Boeing said the company believed that by disclosing information concerning the Mesa filing, its stock price might run up sharply, making it more expensive and less appealing for Mesa to buy Boeing shares.    Boeing's corporate profile is already unappealing to takeover specialists, some individuals close to Boeing said. Its business lines -- which include defense and aircraft manufacturing -- are closely interwoven. There aren't any major units that a suitor could easily sell off to reduce debt taken on to finance a takeover. Its defense operations require that top managers receive government clearance, and keeping the business intact after a takeover could be difficult.    However, Wall Street executives say, other Boeing characteristics make it particularly good candidate for a recapitalization that could yield a bonanza for shareholders. For instance, Boeing's top management, which has a reputation for being financially conservative, has maintained a debt-to-equity ratio of about 3%, one of the lowest of any company in the nation. But its stock price is well below the $75 to $100 a share analysts believe the company is worth. Wall Street executives say Boeing could take on additional debt without any difficulty and use the proceeds to enhance the value of its shares.    Analysts said Boeing appears to be a classic Pickens target, with an order backlog of nearly $30 billion, more than $3 billion in cash and liquid investments, and $900 million in Allegis Corp. notes. But unlike some of Mr. Pickens's other targets, Boeing probably isn't a company Mr. Pickens could successfully run -- if that's his goal. As the world's largest maker of commercial aircraft and a big player in military contracting, Boeing would be in trouble if management that was inexperienced in those areas took over, aerospace analysts and industry observers said.    Moreover, they added, Mr. Pickens could destroy the company's businesses if he regarded Boeing's cash as a &quot;hidden asset&quot; that could easily be used to pay down any debt taken on to acquire the company.    Alan Benasuli, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, estimated that Boeing this year will spend about $800 million of its cash for research and development, about $500 million for payment of deferred taxes, more than $200 million to complete its recent acquisition of ARGO Systems Inc. and some of the rest on tooling to increase aircraft production rates.    An even more essential requirement, if Boeing is to hold on to its declining market share, is to spend the cash on aircraft sales through seller financing -- such as the notes it took as payment for the 747-400 jets it sold to Allegis's United Airlines unit, Mr. Benasuli said.    New management could redeploy cash by halting Boeing's investment required to win government contracts, including the Air Force's advanced tactical aircraft and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's manned space station. It could also stop spending on new commercial aircraft, such as derivatives of the twin-jet 737 and the wide-body 747, and kill Boeing's plans to spend what analysts estimate to be about $3 billion through 1992 to develop its advanced-technology 7J7 aircraft.    But if it went too far, dismantling significant Boeing military programs, the Defense Department would protest the plan to the Securities and Exchange Commission on national security grounds, said Air Force Secretary Aldridge.    Oil industry analysts and money managers who follow Mr. Pickens and his Mesa Limited Partnership said Mr. Pickens may be hoping to put Boeing into play for a possible acquirer, but they are skeptical that the oilman or his oil and gas partnership plans to try to acquire Boeing.    &quot;I think he's out to make money for Mesa. I don't think he wants to run an airplane company,&quot; said Philip J. Kehl, vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    Neither Mr. Pickens nor his spokesman returned phone calls.    Mesa may have been among the buyers of Boeing stock yesterday. The partnership has, in the past, done much of its stock buying through Jefferies andamp; Co., a Los Angeles-based brokerage firm. Early yesterday, Jefferies was understood to be a heavy buyer of Boeing shares. Large blocks were also bought by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc.    Mesa has ready access to about $1 billion, composed of an estimated $300 million in cash and marketable securities and the remainder in available credit lines. Analysts estimated that the partnership could raise a total of $2 billion to $4 billion for an acquisition, but even that amount would leave Mr. Pickens far short of the funds needed to buy Boeing -- about $8.35 billion at the current stock price.    More likely, analysts said, Mr. Pickens is trying to make money as an investor, and sees an opportunity in Boeing for high returns. Mr. Pickens has said several times that Mesa might try to make up a shortfall in its cash flow with securities gains. Analysts estimated that Mesa could come up $45 million to $70 million short of the cash flow it needs this year to support a $1.50-a-unit distribution on its preferred and a $2-a-unit distribution on its common. The company has said it will continue the $2-a-unit distribution at least through the first quarter of 1988.    To fend off Mr. Pickens, Boeing's board adopted a shareholder rights plan Monday. But the company is inclined to resist stronger measures. In response to previous questions about a possible stock buy-back, for instance, Boeing officials have said that they believe companies only repurchase stock when they can't find a more productive place for their cash.    Yesterday, a person close to Boeing said &quot;it would be out of character&quot; for the aerospace company, whose management is proud and fiercely independent, to agree to a buy-back or a restructuring to satisfy an outsider. However, the person said Boeing executives &quot;can't rule out&quot; the possibility that a defensive move stronger than the &quot;poison-pill&quot; measures adopted by the board Monday might be necessary. &quot;They don't know what he's up to,&quot; the person said. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment.    As previouly reported, Boeing's action Monday was in response to Mesa's Hart-Scott-Rodino filing. Under rules of Hart-Scott-Rodino, a company or partnership wishing to acquire as much as $15 million of stock must wait for 30 days before receiving permission. The acquirer can, as Mr. Pickens and Mesa did, ask for early clearance. The 30-day waiting period was set to expire tomorrow, but early clearance was granted. Individuals familiar with Boeing said that the company wasn't obligated to disclose to shareholders at any time that it knew about the Mesa filing.    Previously, Mesa hasn't had to file a notification until it purchased more than 5% of a target company's shares. But Hart-Scott-Rodino requires that certain investment partnerships report shareholdings as small as $15 million to the Federal Trade Commission.    The partnerships required to file early disclosure under the new ruling must be controlled by a partner who claims 50% or more of the partnership's profit or assets. In this case, that partner is Mesa.    Attorneys said Mesa wouldn't have had to file a notification if it was simply buying for investment purposes. If the Mesa group acquires a Boeing stake of 5% or more, it will also have to comply with SEC rules that mandate disclosure within 10 days of reaching the 5% mark.    It wasn't clear yesterday whether Mesa exercised its right to buy additional Boeing shares. A person familiar with the partnership's purchases of Boeing's shares said Mesa owned about $15 million of Boeing shares Monday, a stake of about two-tenths of 1%.    With the more restrictive laws regarding early disclosure of stockholdings, partnership investors, such as Mesa, would look for companies whose stock prices are extremely depressed relative to the value of their assets. Individuals familiar with Mesa's stock-picking habits said the stock run-up yesterday in Boeing shares wasn't likely to deter Mesa from believing that the company was strongly undervalued.    Boeing has retained First Boston Corp. and the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom to represent it. Mesa hasn't hired an investment banker, but it is using the Houston law firm of Baker and Botts.    Other aerospace and defense stocks were also hot items in the stock market yesterday, rising sharply in the morning but losing about half their gains by closing. Some examples include Lockheed Corp., which rose 75 cents, to $56; United Technologies Corp., up 87.5 cents, to $55.875; McDonnell Douglas Corp., up 50 cents, to $73.50; Raytheon Co., up $1.50, to $79.125; General Dynamics Corp., up 50 cents, to $67.875; and Northrop Corp., up 75 cents, to $48.625.    Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it affirmed Boeing's debt ratings on $250 million of senior notes outstanding and $250 million of debt securities and commercial paper. While Sandamp;P said it doesn't view a Mesa takeover as a &quot;strong possiblity,&quot; it said: &quot;A takeover of Boeing by Mesa would have serious negative rating implications for Boeing's outstanding rated debt, while attempts to prevent a takeover, with a major stock repurchase, also could have negative rating implications.&quot;    ---                    BOEING DATA            (Year ended Dec. 31, 1986)    Sales                         $16.34 billion    Net income                    $655 million,                                  or $4.28 a share    Employees                     118,500    Total backlog                 $29.1 billion*    Capital expenditures          $795 million    Research and development      $757 million    Long-term debt                $259 million*    Cash                          $3.27 billion    Common shares                 155.4 million   *As of June 30, 1987</TEXT></DOC>
