The once influential Communists are plagued by internal disputesand a decline in voter support that have damaged the party's imageas a serious political force.   Party Secretary General Gerardo Iglesias recently announced hewould not seek re-election, and no major figure has stepped forwardto take his place.   ``It looks as if top leaders are shying away from divisiveleadership moves, and the Central Committee seeks to go tocollective leadership rather than back a charismatic-type chief, ''said Angela Bautista, editor of the Central Committee organ WorkersWorld.   About 600 delegates to the congress are to elect 90 members tothe party's central committee, which will then try to choose asecretary general.   The party reached its zenith in 1979, when it won 10 percent ofthe vote in municipal elections.   But its support has waned since it suffered a disastrous setbackin 1982 general elections, receiving just 3.8 percent of the voteas Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists swept into power ina landslide.   Between 1979 and 1983, the party lost 65 percent of itsmembership, or 120,000 people, party figures made public Fridayshowed. Since 1985, it has further dropped from 67,400 to 62,300.   Antonio Perez Henares, a political writer for the newsweeklyTiempo, said a widespread feeling among Communists is: ``How can wecontinue to believe in the party if the party leaders themselvesdon't believe in it enough to want to lead it?''   Before it was legalized in 1977, two years after the death ofdictator Gen. Francisco Franco, the party was the country'sbest-organized political force. It enjoyed great support from theyoung, intellectuals and artists.   The party was at the forefront of the Eurocommunism movement,which advocates independence from the Soviet Union and support fordemocratic political procedures.   But the party's appeal waned. When Spain entered the EuropeanEconomic Community in 1986, the Socialists consolidated their holdon patronage and public administration.   In the 1986 general elections, the United Left coalition, whichincluded Communist candiates, got only 4.6 percent of the vote andseven deputies in the Cortes, or Spanish parliament.   The current leadership crisis came to a head last December whenhighly-respected deputy Enrique Curiel resigned as the party's No.2 man in what was viewed as a protest of the leadership ofIglesias, a 43-year-old coal miner who has headed the party for thepast five years.   Since the 1982 electoral debacle, the party's strategy has beento bring together all popular protest movements, includingpacifists, ecologists and those opposed to Spanish membership inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to the four U.S.military bases in Spain.   It also backed months of strikes and demonstrations early lastyear by the Communist-oriented Workers Commissions trade union andworkers seeking greater pay increases and jobs for Spain's morethan three million unemployed.   Spain currently has a 21 percent jobless rate, Europe's highest.   But the party has failed to capitalize on the unemployment issue.   The United Left coalition won just 6.9 percent of the vote inJune municipal elections, down from the 8.1 percent the SpanishCommunist Party won in June 1983 municipal elections.   The party continues to make its presence felt through its closeties with the 700,000-strong Workers Commissions, the dominantlabor force in large state industries.   Splinter Communist groups include the tiny pro-Soviet SpanishPeoples Communist Party, and the even tinier Spanish WorkersParty-Communist Unity, founded in 1986 by Santiago Carrillo, wholed the mainstream party throughout its underground period and intolegality.</TEXT></DOC>
