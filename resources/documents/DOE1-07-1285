The clinical history may also be deceiving:a smoker over 35 years of age need not necessarily have a primary lungcancer, but this event is frequent enough to justify a diagnostic thoracotomy.In our series, chest tomography proved to be useful and sometimes revealedunsuspected lesions. In contrast, bronchoscopy is useful only for centrallylocated lesions, and the same is true for bronchial washing and brushing.Finally, thoracotomy, possibly an axillary one with enucleation or possiblytransegmentary resection, is the most frequent operation in benign lungtumors, because of the unfailing diagnosis and for the minimal functionaldamage to the patient. A diagnostic thoracotomy may also avoid the psychologicstress suffered by a patient with a simple but undiagnosed benign lungtumor.</TEXT></DOC>
