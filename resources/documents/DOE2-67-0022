(Con Edison) has an economic developmentprogram to assist business grow and prosper in New York City and WestchesterCounty. In 1981, the utility introduced a program of reduced electricrates (Area Development Rate) for economic development to help revitalizeeight areas of the South Bronx and Brooklyn that were economically disadvantagedneighborhoods. This program has been very successful. It has helped producejobs; it has helped to raise business activity in some of the most economicallydepressed areas of the nation; and, by increasing the usage of underutilizedCompany distribution facilities, it has increased Con Edison's efficiencyto benefit all customers. It is established that this program resultedin a more than 24 percent average reduction of electric costs for participatingcompanies. After recognition of this successful area development program,in late 1983, the N.Y. State legislature announced that as a matter ofpublic policy electric utility rate incentives should, where appropriate,be used to foster economic activity in the state. The legislature foundthat &quot;the cost of utility services can be a significant factor in retainingand attracting healthy businesses and the employment opportunities andeconomic activity that they provide. The Law empowered the N.Y. StatePublic Service Commission to approve (after joint consideration withthe Department of Commerce) economic incentive electricity rates thatare cost based and will lead to jobs and economic vitality.</TEXT></DOC>
