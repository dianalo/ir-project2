Agrees to Buy Alco Health </HL><AUTHOR> Carrie Dolan (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MCK AAHS ASN </CO><IN> TNM PHA </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   McKesson Corp. said it reached a definitive agreement to acquire Alco Health Services Corp. for $30 a share, or about $500 million.    Earlier this month, the two began friendly merger talks after Alco Health received a leveraged buy-out offer of $26 a share, or $434 million, from a management-led group.    The purchase of Alco Health is in line with McKesson's plan to focus on the drug and health-care market. After the acquisition, about 85% of McKesson's revenue will come from drug and health-care businesses, the company said. McKesson also has interests in bottled water, car-care products and managing prescription drug-benefit programs. Since 1980, the company has divested itself of its food, home building, chemical and wine-and-spirits distribution operations.    McKesson said it will begin a tender offer by Monday for all Alco Health stock. After completion of the tender offer, any remaining shares outstanding will be converted in a merger into cash at the same price paid in the tender offer, the company said.    The offer is subject to certain regulatory conditions, McKesson said. It isn't subject to purchase of a minimum number of shares, or to financing conditions.    McKesson also said it entered into a stock purchase agreement with Alco Standard Corp., which owns 50% of Alco Health Services. Under that accord, a McKesson unit will buy 6.3 million Alco Health shares owned by a unit of Alco Standard, for the tender-offer price. Those shares represent about 49% of the issued and outstanding shares of Alco Health, McKesson said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Alco Health shares closed up 50 cents, at $29.50, on volume of 1.5 million shares. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, McKesson shares closed up 37.5 cents, at $33.875, on volume of 29,300 shares.    Alco Health, based in Valley Forge, Pa., is a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals. For the six months ended March 31, it earned $11 million, or 87 cents a share, up from the year-earlier $8.5 million, or 65 cents a share. Revenue was $1.02 billion, up from the year-earlier $832.6 million.    For the year ended March 31, McKesson posted net income of $95 million, or $2.14 a share, compared with the year-earlier $89.7 million, or $1.95 a share. Revenue was $7.28 billion, up from the year-earlier $6.67 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
