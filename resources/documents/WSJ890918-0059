Revenue for the quarter ended July 31 increased 51%, to $9.9 million from $6.6 million.    Bonneville, which develops and operates alternative-energy plants, said in Salt Lake City that it is repositioning itself from short-term construction and the sale of power projects to long-time ownership.    The company also said it is on target to meet its goal of generating 70% of its revenue from recurring power sales and owning 800,000 kilowatts of producing power projects by April 1992. </TEXT></DOC>
