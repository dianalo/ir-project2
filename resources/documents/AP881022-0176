But this craze of debt-financed buyouts and other types ofrestructuring, while often rewarding stockholders with windfallprofits, also raise a number of troubling questions, such as whereis all the money coming from, how will it affect the economy, andwhat happens if the money cannot be repaid.   Many critics believe the stupendous movement of money andrapidly rising debt loads associated with these transactionsreflect nearsighted values that continue to grip corporate Americaand Wall Street _ despite the lessons of speculative excesseslearned from the stock crash a year ago.   Critics also blame the Reagan era of deregulation, laxenforcement of antitrust laws and to some extent the stock crashitself, which cut the price of many publicly held companies andmade them attractive targets.   All of these elements have lured staggering sums of investorcash, from pension managers to foreign banks, into the hands ofdealmaking strategists who promise a quick return.   ``Money, the ability to get money when you need it, in thesehuge amounts, is critical to all that's happening,'' said KathrynRudie Harrigan, professor of strategic management at ColumbiaBusiness School in New York.   More conservative use of this money, she said, ``doesn't lookattractive when you're in a short-term world. We can't wait thatlong. We've got to have instant pudding.''   By some estimates, the amount of money available to financeleveraged buyouts or LBOs _ in which a buyer borrows to acquire acompany and repays the debt with the company's earnings, cash flowor assets _ totaled less than $100 million in 1980. Now it totalsat least $250 billion.   Contrary to popular belief, most of this money does not comefrom the fortunes of the rich. Much of it comes, indirectly, fromthe pension funds of millions of American workers and retirees.   Federal Reserve Board statistics show that the assets in thesefunds alone totaled nearly $2 trillion last year.   The money also comes from foreign lenders, notably Japanesebanks, the world's richest. Even some of the most conservative U.S.banks and Wall Street firms, which once shied away from LBOs asladen with uncertainty, are now joining in with hundreds ofmillions in their own capital.   ``It's really staggering, the amount of money out there that canbe focused in any area,'' said Chriss Street, managing director ofSeidler Amdec Securities Inc., a Los Angeles investment firm.   ``I think it's a sign of greed more than anything,'' he said.``Money always tends to drive in the rear-view mirror, it followstrack records. Right now the track records of people involved inLBOs are staggering.''   Dealmaking firms that specialize in LBOs, such as KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., have enjoyed spectacular success, givingtheir own investors and clients returns of 30 percent or more ayear.   Compare that with 12.5 percent so far this year in the stockmarket, roughly 8 percent for a 1-year Treasury bill, 7.5 percentin a money market mutual fund and less in a standard savingsaccount.   Kohlberg completed the biggest LBO on record two years ago, a$6.1 billion deal that took food conglomerate Beatrice Cos. private.   But the definition of how big an LBO can get was rewritten thispast week, when the management of tobacco-food giant RJR-Nabiscosaid it was considering a $17 billion LBO, which would be thebiggest corporate takeover ever.   This gargantuan proposal came only three days after PhilipMorris launched an $11.4 billion takeover bid for Kraft Inc. andonly a few weeks after British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLCoffered $5.2 billion for Pillsbury Co.   The common message in these undertakings, many securitiesprofessionals said, was that any company can be a takeover target.   ``They once said that just because Everest wasn't climbeddoesn't mean it couldn't be,'' Street said. ``My gut feeling isyou've got probably a couple of years before the real megadealswill come to the fore.''   Charles M. LaLoggia, editor of Special Situations Report, arespected market newsletter based in Rochester, N.Y., said ``I'llbet by the end of the year, something happens that even dwarfs thisRJR deal.''   By far, the biggest worry about this frenzy of dealmaking is itseffect on the economy. Aside from the upheaval on millions ofaffected workers and managers, there is an increasing fear thatLBO-restructured companies have too much debt and could default ifinterest rates rise even slightly.   ``If our current economic picture should change _ if we shouldgo into a recession _ the consequences for these LBOs are notgood,'' James Van Horne, a Stanford Business School professor,wrote in a recent edition of the school's magazine. ``They arefinanced with 90 percent debt or more, allowing almost no margin oferror or cushion.''   The concern has been heightened recently because thesedebt-financed takeovers are growing at the waning stages of aneconomic recovery cycle that is now nearly 6 years old.   ``When you want to be leveraged the most is when you'rebottoming out and on the way up,'' said LaLoggia, who predicts therelentless pace of LBOs could lead to another financial crisis likethe crash last year.   ``I don't see where bankers or businessmen, no matter howsophisticated they are, are less susceptible to the herdinstinct,'' he said. ``They're going to have to pay the piper. Ayear or two down the line, in hindsight, it's going to beincredible how bad their judgment was.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
