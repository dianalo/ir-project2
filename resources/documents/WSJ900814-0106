But purring away at the center of it all is a late 20thcentury anomaly: a $12 million supercomputer.</LP><TEXT>   In a gamble that startled its conservative industry, theNo. 4 U.S. drug maker recently became the firstpharmaceutical company to install its own supercomputer -- aCray-2, one of the most powerful machines made by CrayResearch Inc., the leading supercomputer maker.   The machine can't discover drugs, nor does it guaranteethat Lilly's Randamp;D record will improve. But it does add toLilly scientists' bag of tricks a three-ton tool ofunprecedented power, amplifying their ability to experimentwith molecular images and sift through endless new-drugcandidates.   Lilly's purchase has also helped touch off an industrywidenew-hardware race. Industry leader Merck andamp; Co. is tappingsupercomputer-like IBM equipment in a pact with InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. Monsanto Co. leased a supercomputer,and Abbott Laboratories, Schering-Plough Corp. and othershave upgraded their computer capabilities as well.   The wave of investment has raised hopes of streamliningthe riskiest and most expensive research process in U.S.industry: the search for breakthrough drugs. Scientists havebeen studying images of molecules on computer screens formore than a decade, but the latest trend in computerequipment is carrying them far beyond the tinkering of thepast. For the first time, computers and workstations arepowerful and sophisticated enough to grapple with models ofthe large, complex human proteins and enzymes involved intoday's cutting-edge drug research.   Instead of just presenting fixed visual models, the newtechnology enables scientists to manipulate images of bigmolecules and watch them interact with other substances inhuman-like environments. It allows researchers to replaceslow, near-random laboratory testing of hundreds ofsubstances with more rapid theoretical screening.   &quot;Three years ago, there wasn't enough computational poweror enough knowledge to make this {new technology} useful,&quot;says Charles T. Casale, president of Aberdeen Group, aBoston-based computer consulting and research group. Now &quot;thequestion is, `Who is going to get there first with asignificant breakthrough?'&quot;   The new technology also holds out the hope of streamlininghuman tests of experimental compounds. By helping researchersanalyze test data for a wider range of doses on more patientgroups, for example, computers could help identify safer,potentially less toxic doses.   For the first time, some companies are even givingcomputers partial credit for discoveries. Schering-Ploughcites computer techniques in the development of aschizophrenia drug now being tested on humans. Novo NordiskA/S says computers helped speed up discovery of an insulinproduct, also in human trials.   Some believe computer-assisted design will have as big animpact on pharmaceutical research as it did on the auto, oiland aerospace industries in the 1970s. &quot;Over the nextdecade,&quot; says Larry L. Smarr, director of the National Centerfor Supercomputing Applications at the University ofIllinois, &quot;supercomputer simulation will become one of thepillars of research in pharmaceuticals.&quot;   Applying computers to the arcane art of drug research is agamble. Unlike car fenders and aerospace parts, new drugscan't be engineered based on existing knowledge. Scientifictheory is lacking, and the molecules involved are toocomplex. Many have as many as 5,000 atoms and look like fuzzyballs when reproduced on screen. Designing a drug fromscratch by computer would require more mathematical knowledgeand computational power than exists today.   Instead, scientists must apply a combination of skill,experience, intuition and sheer luck to identify a potentialdrug for a particular disease. The industry screens anestimated 10,000 compounds for every one that reaches themarket, a process that typically takes 10 to 12 years andcosts more than $100 million. The odds of success are so lowthat oil wildcatters have a &quot;sure thing&quot; by comparison, Mr.Casale says.   That hasn't stopped some computer vendors from makingoutrageous claims for their offerings. One European softwarevendor even promised its product could design drugs fromstart to finish.   For their part, drug makers are desperate to speed up thediscovery process. Although Randamp;D spending is soaring, genericproducts are slashing the profitable life of brand-namedrugs. Rising international competition is holding down drugprices and eroding U.S. companies' share of the world market.To sustain their current profitability, drug makers mustimprove Randamp;D returns.   No one is betting bigger on new computer technology to winthat race than Lilly. With its Randamp;D spending rising at a rateof 16% to 18% a year, Lilly has scored some major successes,fielding the fast-selling new antidepressant Prozac anddiversifying its product line away from antibiotics.Nevertheless, &quot;they don't have the best lineup of productsover the next one or two years,&quot; says Mary Ellen McCarthy, ananalyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.   With no way to project the bottom-line impact of newcomputer technology, the Cray purchase &quot;boils down to a leapof faith -- a gamble,&quot; admits Mel Perelman, a Lilly vicepresident and president of Lilly Research Laboratories.   Whatever the outcome, there are no signs of doubt inLilly's laboratories. Scientists are already using thesupercomputer to study insulin compounds and potential curesfor AIDS and Alzheimer's disease, among other things.Voluntary use of the new machine in the first few weeks afterits late-May installation rose far faster than expected. &quot;Ithas surprised us continually,&quot; says John S. Wold, executivedirector of Lilly Research Laboratories.   Desktop terminals all over Lilly's sprawling headquartersare hooked up to the Cray. More than 40 Lilly scientists havetaken supercomputer training at the University of Illinois'sNational Center for Supercomputer Applications. Lilly haseven turned the machine -- a red-and-black cylinder about thesize of an airline ticket counter -- into a touristattraction, ensconcing it behind a panel of smoked glass in avideo-equipped visitors' gallery.   For researchers like James Wikel, a senior chemist, themachine is a powerful aid to the imagination. Once restrictedto clumsy ball-and-stick models of molecules of the kindcommon in chemistry classrooms, he is beginning to be able toconstruct a big enzyme on his screen, study the relevant&quot;receptor&quot; site, and test its reaction to various drugcandidates.   On a computer screen in one of Lilly's modeling labs, heshows a visitor a rotating, multi-hued image of a complexhuman enzyme. Buried within its honeycomb-like maze of atomsare clues to the enzyme's biological activity that couldyield insights into ways to block the AIDS virus.   Whether he is jogging, relaxing at home or commuting towork, the chemist carries such molecular images with him. Allthe while, consciously or unconsciously, his mind seeks thenew scientific insights of which breakthrough drugs are born.   Without the computer, &quot;I would have to start withsomething like this,&quot; Mr. Wikel says, blackening the screenby switching off his terminal. Now, he says, &quot;I canessentially walk all the way around {the molecule} as if itwere a table in the middle of the room, to get a view fromall angles.&quot;   The images &quot;will spring forth . . . when you're notthinking about it consciously,&quot; Mr. Wikel says. &quot;Suddenly,something will click and you'll say, `Aha] That's what I waslooking for.'&quot; That &quot;aha factor&quot; -- the &quot;eureka principle,&quot;as Roger G. Harrison, Lilly's director of organic andphysical chemistry research, calls it -- is the key tobreakthroughs.   Lilly executives aren't making any promises about the newtechnology. Indeed, the science of new-drug research iswidely seen as a mature field, &quot;with the `easy' discoverieswell in the past and the easy-to-cure diseases alreadycured,&quot; Mr. Casale wrote in a report on the new technology.&quot;New discoveries cost more, take longer and typically areaccompanied by side effects often undiscovered for years.&quot;   Nevertheless, Lilly scientists are confident that &quot;we'recloser and closer to dealing with these uncertainties than weever have been,&quot; says Riaz Abdulla, Lilly's head ofsupercomputer applications.   The supercomputer &quot;puts us in a better competitiveposition to really come up with the compounds of the future,&quot;Mr. Harrison adds. &quot;Our great discoveries are yet to come.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
