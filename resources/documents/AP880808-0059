Students had calledfor a nationwide general strike.   Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported 30,000 people took part inprotests in Rangoon and more than 10,000 students, Buddhist monksand others staged demonstrations in Mandalay, Burma's secondlargest city.   No violence was reported in what may have been the largestprotest in Burma since democracy was overthrown 26 years ago.   ``You couldn't see the end of (the crowd),'' said GeorginaAllen, a 22-year-old British student who today returned to Bangkokfrom Rangoon. She said she saw ``solid flanks'' of unarmeddemonstrators clenching their fists, cheering and clapping theirhands as they marched along a main street in Rangoon.   ``We're going for democracy. We're fighting for democracy,'' shequoted one student as saying.   Allen said some Burmese students told her, ``We don't want tochange the government. We want a socialist government. We hate thepresident. He's an evil man.''   Many shops were closed and there were reports that some workersstayed away from their factory jobs, but other stores were open forbusiness, said Western and Asian diplomats reached by telephone inthe capital, Rangoon.   The extent of the strike was not immediately clear.   The demonstrators, most of them wearing handkerchiefs aroundtheir faces to avoid identification, walked in orderly fashion inthe downtown area and there was no confrontation with troopspatrolling the city, the diplomats said.   They said they did not know whether protests took place in otherparts of the city or the surrounding area.   Students have been at the forefront of protests against thenation's new hard-line leader, Sein Lwin. They blame him forordering the suppression of demonstrations in Rangoon last Marchand June in which, by unofficial count, more than 100 people werekilled.   Last month, the former army general was named president of Burmaand chairman of its ruling party.   The Chinese news agency Xinhua in Rangoon quoted officialnewspapers as saying demonstrations broke out Saturday in Pegu,Yenangyang and Thanatpin, with police opening fire to dispersecrowds.   There were also unconfirmed reports reaching Bangkok thatstudents and Buddhist monks held weekend demonstrations inMandalay, Burma's second largest city.   Authorities issued orders banning all public gatherings,speech-making, marches and agitation in Pegu, Yenangyang andThanatpin. Martial law was clamped on Rangoon, the capital, onWednesday after demonstrators demanded Sein Lwin's ouster.   The official Rangoon Radio, monitored in Bangkok, said Sundaythat authorities investigating recent disturbances found a list ofthose ``who pulled the strings from behind-the-scenes'' andreleased 80 people from Insein prison.   It gave no further details of the alleged ringleaders pinpointedby the authorities.   The 80 said to have been released _ 11 students, 66 civiliansand three civil servants _ appeared to be among 149 people thegovernment said it arrested in connection with last week'sdemonstrations.   Before the demonstrations, authorities arrested a leadinggovernment critic, former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, and several otherpeople, including Associated Press correspondent Sein Win.</TEXT></DOC>
