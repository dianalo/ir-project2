(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thirty years ago, a Titan 1 missileroared off a launch pad here on its maiden test flight, spawning anevolution that soon will see one of its offspring debut as America'smost powerful unmanned space rocket.   By today's standards, that first Titan 1 launch on Feb. 6, 1959,was not much. Only the first stage was fueled, with the secondstage's tanks filled with water for weight, and it traveled only 300miles down the Atlantic Tracking Range.   But before many months, the Air Force rocket was hurling dummywarheads more than 5,000 miles at speeds up to 17,000 mph.   It was the nation's first two-stage intercontinental ballisticmissile and at the time the most powerful delivery system in itsnuclear arsenal.   ``We certainly were plowing new ground with a two-stage vehicle.The Titan 1 was the giant of our launch vehicle family,'' said GaryD. Flora, who as a young engineer began working on Titans for MartinMarietta in 1960. He now is president of the company's Space LaunchSystems Co. in Denver.   But the Titan 1 was soon obsolete. It was replaced by the larger,more powerful Titan 2, which with its storable fuel could sit formonths in an underground silo, ready to be fired at almost amoment's notice.   Fifty-four Titan 2s stood on alert for nearly 20 years in165-foot silos in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona before the last onewas deactivated in 1982. The liquid-fueled missiles were replaced bythe Minuteman and the submarine-launched Trident missiles, withadvanced technology and easier-to-handle solid fuel.   Modified Titan 2s were used in 1965 and 1966 to hoist 10 pairs ofGemini astronauts into orbit to rehearse techniques needed to sendApollo astronauts to the moon.   Then, using the Titan 2 as a basic core, Martin Marietta and theAir Force built a series of Titan 3s by improving the rocket motors,enlarging the fuel tanks, and adding solid fuel booster rockets andupper stages.   Most Titan 3s were used by the Air Force to launch satellites forsuch things as reconnaissance, communications, and navigation. NASAadded its Centaur upper stage to a few of the vehicles to launch theHelios deep space probe and the Voyager and Viking payloads toexplore the planets.   The next generation, the Titan 4, is on a Canaveral launch pad,ready for its maiden flight within a few weeks with a classifiedmilitary payload.   The new rocket will be able to lift 39,000 pounds into low orbitor carry 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit, 23,000 miles out, wherecommunications satellites reside.   The Air Force has ordered 23 Titan 4s from Martin Marietta andnegotiations are under way for 26 more. The company also ismodifying 14 of the old Titan 2s removed from silos so they canserve as medium-size space boosters. The first of these was launchedsuccessfully with an Air Force payload last September.   Flora said the Titan 4 is a very ``robust, blossoming program''and he expects the rocket will be America's workhorse space rocket,primarily for military payloads, until near the end of the century.   ``With Titan 4 we are pushing into a new generation in terms oflift capability,'' said W.E. Fields, director of CanaveralOperations for Martin Marietta's Space Launch Systems.   Fields said the Titan 4, like the Titan 3, will grow and becomeeven more powerful as improvements are introduced.   And separate teams of contractors headed by Martin Marietta,Boeing and General Dynamics are studying designs for a new rocketfor the early 21st century capable of lifting 100,000 to 200,000pounds into orbit.   ``Whether that becomes a derivative of Titan or not isproblematical,'' said Fields, who began working on the Titan programin 1956.</TEXT></DOC>
