Many market analysts released crop estimates yesterday because the federal government is slated tomorrow to release its first official projection of the corn and soybean harvests.    Earlier this year, many analysts were concerned about the prospects for the 1989 harvests because the Midwest drought exhausted the subsoil moisture upon which the crops depend during dry spells. However, timely rains this summer apparently have persuaded analysts to project nearly average yields for corn and soybeans.    Based on Aug. 1 conditions, most analysts expect a fall soybean harvest of 1.95 billion bushels compared with the 1988 harvest of 1.54 billion bushels. The consensus is for a 1989 corn crop of 7.53 billion bushels, about 53% higher than the 4.92 billion bushels harvested last year after the drought.    In trading yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of the soybean contract for November delivery fell to a life-of-contract low before rebounding slightly to settle at $5.64 a bushel, down 16.5 cents a bushel.    Conrad Leslie, a closely watched crop analyst here, said he is projecting that U.S. farmers will harvest 7.72 billion bushels of corn and 1.98 billion bushels of soybeans. Mr. Leslie's projection is based on a monthly survey of elevator managers and grain handlers, among others.    Some analysts are more conservative, in part because they suspect that prolonged spring rains prevented some farmers in the eastern Corn Belt states of Ohio and Indiana from planting corn in time for a full growing season. Likewise, rain in states such as Arkansas and Mississippi might have trimmed the planting of soybeans. The Agriculture Department is expected to release a special survey of crop conditions in these states tomorrow.    Although tomorrow's crop estimate by the Agriculture Department will be the first based on government field surveys, some analysts have extrapolated from previous reports that government economists have been expecting a fall harvest of 7.45 billion bushels of corn and 1.95 billion bushels of soybeans.    Despite any rebound in the corn crop, analysts aren't expecting the re-emergence of the type of burdensome stockpiles that plagued U.S. agriculture earlier this decade.    Before the corn harvest begins in earnest in September, U.S. stockpiles are expected to have fallen to about 1.83 billion bushels, less than half the level of September 1988. Based on estimates for strong demand for U.S. corn by the Soviet Union, among other things, analysts don't expect U.S. stockpiles to grow enough to depress corn prices from current levels.    About two years ago, the U.S. stockpile of corn had swollen to about 60% of annual production.    In other U.S. commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Petroleum futures rallied in what some traders called a technical correction to recent price declines. The futures price of West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery rose 21 cents to settle at $18.12 a barrel. October and November crudes were up 21 cents and 13 cents, respectively, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. There was little market-affecting news except for comments by Secretary-General Subroto of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In a speech in Tulsa, Okla., Mr. Subroto reiterated an earlier prediction that demand for OPEC's oil could reach 22 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter. He also said he expects OPEC's target price of $18 a barrel to be maintained in the fourth quarter. Still, oil trading was thin. In the U.S. futures market, &quot;people were waiting on the APIs,&quot; said one trader -- a reference to the closely watched weekly report on U.S. oil statistics released every Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute. The report, issued after futures trading had ended for the day, showed that U.S. crude oil inventories, which had been expected to decline in the week ended last Friday, increased instead by 3.4 million barrels. There was also a modest gain in U.S. gasoline inventories and a more substantial increase -- nearly 2.5 million barrels -- in distillate fuel stocks.    SUGAR: Futures prices ended lower after being unable to sustain an early rally. The October delivery settled at 13.81 cents a pound, for a loss of 0.13 cent. At one point, October traded as high as 14.10 cents. According to one analyst, the progress of the European beet crop, as indicated by the first tests in Sweden and West Germany, which show the beets to be of good size and with a high sugar content, might have influenced some selling. Another analyst observed that significant buying of physical sugar has been absent in the world market. Traders who had bought futures contracts in anticipation that prices would rise on news of purchases of physical sugar may have become tired of waiting and are selling their holdings, he said. COTTON: Futures prices recovered from Monday's sharp declines with advances approaching the daily limit of two cents a pound. The December contract rose 1.90 cents a pound to 75.86 cents. Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, pointed out that the fluctuations were all part of a consolidation that is taking place. &quot;The fundamentals haven't changed,&quot; he said. &quot;We still are facing smaller crops world-wide, consumption is up, and there will be a drawdown of stocks.&quot; Another analyst said that the market had no real reason to fall or rise so sharply, but that it was oversold Monday and then overbought yesterday. Some contracts were bought by dealers, thought to be hedging sales of physical cotton to Japan, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
