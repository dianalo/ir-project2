John East, who contendedthat government doctors' failure to diagnose a thyroid disorderdrove her husband to suicide.   The first-term Republican killed himself June 19, 1986, byrunning his car in the closed garage of his Greenville, N.C., home.He left a suicide note blaming his doctors, saying, ``they ruinedmy life.''   Priscilla East, contended in her wrongful death lawsuit thatNavy doctors, who provide care for members of Congress, were slowto detect her 55-year-old husband's thyroid condition. The suitsaid the delay triggered severe depression that led to thesenator's suicide.   U.S. District Judge Walter Black, who heard the case without ajury, ruled against Mrs. East.   ``This is a truly tragic case,'' Black wrote in his opinion.``However, the court has determined ... that the medical carerendered by the government doctors, while clearly not perfect, doesnot establish liability in this case.''   Ira Oring, the assistant U.S. Attorney who represented thegovernment, said: ``The physicians have had to live with a cloudover their careers for some period of time. Essentially they havebeen vindicated and we're very happy for them.''   Terri Steinhaus, an attorney representing Mrs. East, said thelawyers believe ``the court's decision is unsupported by theevidence.''   Ms. Steinhaus said Mrs. East had no comment on the decision. Shealso said no decision has been reached on whether an appeal will befiled.   The case was heard in Baltimore because that is the seat of thejudicial district that includes Bethesda Naval Medical Center.</TEXT></DOC>
