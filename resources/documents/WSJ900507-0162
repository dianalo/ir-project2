Expects to Report Change   In Fiscal 1990 Profit Was About Zero   ----   By Frederick Rose   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/07/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4F</SO><CO>   ZRO</CO><IN>DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)</IN><LP>   LOS ANGELES -- Zero Corp. expects to report net incometotaling about $16,144,000, or $1.02 a share, for the yearended March 31, little changed from $16,063,000, or $1.02 ashare, in fiscal 1989, Wilford D. Godbold Jr., president andchief executive officer, said.   Mr. Godbold's disclosure of unaudited fiscal-year resultsindicates that fourth-quarter net totaled $4 million, or 25cents a share, squarely in the middle of analysts' estimatesand a 14% decline from the $4.7 million, or 30 cents a share,of a year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Zero Corp. makes aluminum and plastic storage boxes andenclosures for a wide range of computers, instruments andother delicate objects, as well as cargo containers foraircraft.   Sales for the latest fiscal year totaled about $197million, a 15% boost from $170.9 million in fiscal 1989, Mr.Godbold said in an interview. Details of other revenueweren't available for the latest year. In the earlier year,interest and other revenue of $2.5 million brought totalrevenue to about $173.5 million.   The latest fiscal-year profit is a record -- by a whisker.Sales also are a record. Zero Corp. has posted record profitand sales in 17 of the past 18 years, its chief executivesaid.   Mr. Godbold said he expects another year of record profitand sales in fiscal 1991, ending March 31, but declined to bemore specific.   After a number of boom years, Zero Corp.'s profit climbhas slowed substantially with a downturn in military andcomputer business. Mr. Godbold said Zero Corp. hassystematically reduced military sales to about 19% of itstotal in the latest fiscal year from 37% in 1982. Thecompany's carrying cases and enclosures for the militarygenerally accompany high-technology electronic equipment -- apart of military procurement that Mr. Godbold argues will besustained.   As to the computer-related business, which accounted forabout 21% of revenue in the latest fiscal year, Mr. Godboldsaid sales slid starting last September but seem to haveflattened out beginning in February. Zero makes a widevariety of enclosures and cooling systems for computers andcomputer peripherals.   Mr. Godbold said the unaudited net income in the latestfiscal quarter, ended March 31, includes an undisclosedamount of one-time costs for closure of a Florida productionfacility and transfer of that plant's output to an existingfacility in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts plant, in turn,is expected to become more profitable in coming quarters, hesaid.   Regarding the Air Cargo Equipment Corp. unit, acquired in1988 for about $21.3 million, Mr. Godbold said it isoperating profitably, has shown strong sales growth and isexpected to operate in a sharply growing market through thedecade. Air Cargo Equipment makes cargo containers foraircraft, a business that accounts for about 17% of ZeroCorp.'s sales.   The Air Cargo Equipment unit also makes a line of groundsupport equipment for aircraft that is apparently lesssuccessful, despite repricing of some of its products. Mr.Godbold said the line's performance will be watched closely,suggesting that it may be sold if it doesn't meetexpectations.   As for further acquisitions, Mr. Godbold said Zero Corp.continues to look for two types of investments: smalleroperations with annual sales in the $8 million-to-$15 millionrange, whose products would fold into Zero's existing lines,or larger, stand-alone operations with a niche business andsales in the $25 million-to-$100 million range that couldoperate as separate units, as does Air Cargo Equipment.   Mr. Godbold said the company is &quot;very busily looking atpotential acquisition candidates,&quot; adding that Zero isinterested, among other things, in expanding foreignoperations either through investment in new facilities orthrough acquisition. Foreign business currently accounts foronly about 10% of sales.   The executive said that Zero Corp.'s cash and short-terminvestments total about $13 million currently and thatlong-term debt totals about $4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
