Any political settlement reached by members of Lebanon's dividedlegislature would have to be acceptable to the militia leaders whohave battled for 14 years.   The 30 Moslem and 33 Christian members of Parliament planned tobegin debating today Syria's role in the war, conference sourcessaid.   Christian deputies were demanding that Syria withdraw its 40,000troops from Lebanon as a condition for accepting reforms designedto give more power to Moslems.   Syria and many of its Lebanese Moslem allies advocate puttingthe reforms into effect first, to be followed by a Syrian pullout.   The reforms are intended to rectify the balance of power inLebanon, where Maronite Christians have held the presidency as wellas leading posts in the army and judiciary since independence in1943.   A three-man Arab League mediation committee has submitted acompromise proposal for a phased Syrian withdrawal, first from theimmediate Beirut region, eventually pulling back to the BekaaValley in eastern Lebanon.   The timing was left flexible and conditional on thereinstatement of a central government, although a two-yeartimetable has frequently been mentioned.   A total pullout of Syria's forces from the Bekaa Valley, andLebanon, would follow the conclusion of a security pact betweenDamascus and Beirut at a later stage.   Christian deputy Farid Sarhal said in a speech he distributed tofellow legislators and the press that ``there can be no Syriansolution to the Lebanese problem and (there can be) no solutionwithout Syria and without agreement with it.   ``This is a political fact which we cannot escape or deny.''   The conference sources said mediators including host SaudiForeign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal have been workingintensively to try to get Christians to water down their demand fora Syrian pullout to precede implementation of reforms.   The mediators also lobbied Moslem deputies to try to persuadethem to drop their opposition to any such linkage, said thesources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   In Tehran, the leaders of four Lebanese Moslem factions issued astatement Thursday blaming the Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun,for the crisis in their country, the official Islamic Republic NewsAgency reported.   In a dispatch monitored in Cyprus, it paraphrased the statementas saying any plan that ignores the interests of the Lebanesenation is bound to fail.   The statement said the Taif conference was doomed to failure andcalled for the overthrow of Aoun, the agency said.   It was issued by Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Amalmovement; Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt; Sheik Subhi Tufaili, aleader of the Shiite Hezbollah or Party of God; and Sheik SaeedShaaban, head of a Syrian-backed Sunni fundamentalist faction.   Iranian leaders are calling for the bulk of political power inLebanon to be handed to the Moslems, who are generally believed tomake up about 55 percent of the country's 4 million people.   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Jumblatt as saying``we believe that the Taif conference is no more than a break inthe fighting'' to give the Maronites a chance to rearm their forces.   It also paraphrased Berri as saying no solution was possible inLebanon without the destruction of Maronite rule.   It was not clear whether the tough statements from Iran's andSyria's Moslem allies were meant as a warning of impending warfare,or simply designed to shore up the Moslem militias' position duringthe Taif talks.</TEXT></DOC>
