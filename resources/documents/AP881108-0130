Within the next several weeks, the agency will be sending newguidelines to its examiners and to banks to help them evaluate whenan institution is vulnerable because of highly leveraged lending,said Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for Comptroller Robert Clarke. Hisoffice regulates 4,450 of the nation's 13,400 commercial banks.   In a leveraged buyout or LBO, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co.'s $20.6 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment groupborrows heavily in order to buy out stockholders and take over thecompany.   Often the investment group is composed of the target company'smanagement, which is acting to thwart a threatened takeover byoutsiders. The company's new owners either cut costs or sell offpieces of the company to pay back the loans.   The popularity of such deals and the resulting proliferation ofdebt has led to growing concern about the prospects of heavilyburdened companies in an economic downturn.   Critics of leveraged buyouts say most of the deals have been puttogether since 1982, when the economy began expanding, and have notbeen tested by a recession.   If a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn, the value ofits stock falls. However, a highly leveraged company suffering asetback could be forced into bankruptcy to pay creditors.   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company that monitorslarge bank loans to corporations, banks have lent $70 billion tohighly leveraged transactions since mid-1987. LBOs and takeoverlending comprised 59 percent of the banks' big corporate loans inthe July-September quarter.   Last month, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, whoseagency regulates bank holding companies, told the Senate BankingCommittee that he had warned banks making leveraged buyout loans toconsider borrowers' prospects ``in a range of economic and financialcircumstances.''   Ms. Cross said the comptroller's office began revising itsleveraged buyout guidelines after surveying the practices of 11large money center banks and five regional institutions in latespring and early summer.   ``We found that so far the banks that have been involved seem tohave taken a pretty reasonable approach. Our concern now is goingforward as competition in this area heats up,'' the spokeswomansaid. ``No bank was perfect ... but we did not see any reallysubstantial problems.''   The new examiniation guidelines will not impose limits on LBOlending, but Ms. Cross said they will direct examiners to determineif a banks' policies include limits on LBO lending as a whole andlimits for single deals.   She said examiners also will be checking to see if banks areestablishing adequate reserves against expected LBO losses andwhether they have systems in place to adequately track theperformance of the loans.   ``We want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis ofexactly what the risks are,'' she said.   Another concern is that large banks often sell interests in theloans to smaller institutions, which should be doing their ownindependent credit analysis rather than relying on the originatingbank, the spokeswoman said.   One problem in developing the guidelines is that banks havewidely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveragedlending, she said.   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is working on a definitionof highly leveraged debt, which will be ready in several months,said spokesman Peter Bakstansky. It could serve as guidance to otherfederal regulators.</TEXT></DOC>
