So far the banks have been able to cope, partly by basing their card operations in states where politicians resist the temptation to politicize the marketplace.    But last week banks suddenly found themselves faced with a serious threat. It's called competition. American Express Co. announced that it was bringing out its own variable-rate revolving credit card in May at an initial interest rate of 13.5%, well under what most banks charge. The new Amex &quot;Optima&quot; card competes head-on with bank cards in that users will be allowed to build up debt rather than be expected to pay their bills each month as Amex requires on its familiar green cards. Amex plans to keep its rates at a cozy 1.7 to 1.8 times the prime rate. It will have an excellent mailing list to work from, with 23.8 million American Express cardholders world-wide.    Expanded competition will accomplish far more for consumers than political sound and fury. If the political steam over &quot;high&quot; credit-card rates ever reached the point of a national-rate ceiling, as was proposed in a &quot;National Credit Card Protection Act&quot; debated in the Senate last year, it would be counterproductive for consumers. A study published in the January Federal Reserve Bulletin found that the likely effect of ceilings would be cost cutting by issuers, which would most likely take the form of requiring card applicants to meet higher standards. That would impact most heavily on lower-income families, who also have a hard time getting other forms of credit. Issuers probably would also add some fees. Even nonusers might feel the impact if retailers were forced to raise prices to cover fees or to offset loss of revenues from their own cards.    It is true that banks by and large have made cards a profitable business despite the substantial processing costs involved in handling this form of consumer credit. Some banks with problem loans have found credit cards to be one of their few reliable sources of earnings. The cards have the merit, much appreciated by banking regulators, of helping keep some troubled banks afloat.    They also have the merit of appealing to consumers, despite interest rates ranging upward of 20%. No one forces consumers to use them. If an interest rate looks high, they have the option of paying cash.    As it happens, consumers are becoming more interest-rate sensitive, or so it appears, knowing as they do that the new tax law will phase out interest paid on consumer credit as a deduction. In January, according to Fed figures, consumer credit advanced at an annual rate of only 1.1%, compared with an actual rate of 10.5% in 1986.    The greater consumer sensitivity to interest rates no doubt figured in Amex's plans to take a plunge into the business with a lower-rate card. Credit-card interest almost certainly will come down. It will come down without rate ceilings. Nothing does it like competition. </TEXT></DOC>
