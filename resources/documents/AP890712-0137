The writers announced their support following a four-day meetingof 45 writers and guerrilla leaders of the African National Congressat the northwestern Zimbabwe resort of Victoria Falls. ANC delegateswere led by sculptor Barbara Masikela, head of the movement's artsand culture department.   Writers said they support international isolation of thegovernment and called for ``the strengthening simultaneously of allforms of progressive South African culture.''   The United Nations keeps a blacklist to monitor its ban oncultural and academic ties. Recently, for example, the musical groupthe Commodores was persuaded to cancel a planned tour of SouthAfrica when it was threatened with a spot on the blacklist.   The writers, mostly Afrikaans speakers, called for their languageto be freed from its ``racist connotations'' so that it could findits place in the cultural identity of a united, non-racialdemocratic South Africa.   Afrikaans is a language derived from South Africa's Dutchsettlers. Dutch descendants dominate the government and, in thepast, enforced teaching of Afrikaans in black schools has led towidespread unrest.   The writers deplored ``the way in which our culture isimpovershed by our enforced separation.''   ``It is not heroic to oppose apartheid. It is normal,'' theirstatement said.   The talks, which were organized by the Institute for a DemocraticAlternative In South Africa and ended Tuesday, were the latest in aseries of meetings between white opponents of the Pretoriagovernment and the ANC, which is outlawed in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
