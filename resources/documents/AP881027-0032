When farmers go into their local USDA offices these days to applyfor drought relief or see about the 1989 wheat program, they'llprobably see posters warning about the hazards of growing marijuana.   The USDA says its anti-drug message will be carried into everycorner of the nation by the department's sprawling agencies.   ``One day or one week will not solve the problem of illegal druguse,'' Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Wednesday. ``Butparticipation in this day and in the week's activities can helpmobilize the efforts of concerned citizens _ in government and out _to solve this distressing problem that faces America.''   President Reagan recently proclaimed the week of Oct. 24-30 asNational Drug-Free America Week. In Washington, daily programs ofentertainment and brief speeches are making the rounds of variousgovernment departments.   ``We should note that this effort is bipartisan,'' Lyng said.``Others, like us, are meeting today, or on another day this week,all across the nation. They are assembling in town meetings, inconferences, at rallies, in schools.''   Lyng paid tribute to a number of USDA agencies for anti-drugactivities, including the Forest Service, which he said last year``eradicated more than 250,000 high-potency marijuana plants grownillegally on national forests, plants that had a street value ofnearly $1 billion.''   The Forest Service arrested 135 suspects associated with theillegal pot harvest and charged them with felonies, he said.   Another agency, the Agricultural Stabilization and ConservationService is displaying anti-marijuana posters in its 3,000 countyoffices, he said.   The ASCS handles commodity programs, payments and emergencydrought relief for participating farmers. The agency also is usingnewsletters in its program aimed at illegal marijuana cultivation.   Lyng said the department's Food and Nutrition Service, whichadministers school lunch and food stamp programs, is working withthe American School Food Service Association to support a ``Just SayNo'' message among school children.   The agency also is working with the association to conduct aposter and essay contest with a drug prevention theme amongelementary and secondary schools.   Also, he said, the food agency ``encouraged the dairy industry todisplay `Just Say No' on the side panels of milk cartons used in theSchool Lunch Program, a potential for reaching 26 million childrenin more than 90,000 schools.''   The department Extension Service, through volunteer adult andteenage 4-H leaders, has established alcohol and drug abuse programsin more than 30 states, Lyng said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Department scientists say they havefound a way to make oranges and grapefruits shed their peels quicklyand easily, with only a little tug here and there.   The quick strip job is accomplished by giving the fruit a dose ofan enzyme, pectinase, which dissolves the albedo, or the white,fleshy tissue that glues the peel to the fruit.   Robert A. Baker, a chemist in the department's AgriculturalResearch Service, said the process leaves the fruit's core ``muchcleaner than if you peeled it yourself.''   Baker said the technique, called vacuum infusion, may reducecurrent losses _ as high as 40 percent _ of fruit and juice fromhand peeling and sectioning. He works at the agency's Citrus andSubtropical Products Laboratory, Winter Haven, Fla.   ``Citrus processors can use this technology to make high-qualityorange and grapefruit sections that can be placed in jars, canned,wrapped in plastic and sold as ready-to-eat peeled fruit, or used insalad bars,'' Baker said in a report released here.   Pectinase was described as ``an inexpensive food enzyme approvedby the Food and Drug Administration and used in the jelly and jamindustry.'' Baker said the enzyme solution is so weak that it has notaste and doesn't affect the fruit's flavor.   The technique was invented by Joseph Bruemmer, a chemist wholeads the research group that includes Baker at the Winter Havenlaboratory.</TEXT><TEXT>   _   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Some part-time tobacco graders employed by theAgriculture Department will get pay raises of up to 20 percentbeginning Nov. 6.   Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles said Wednesday that thetobacco graders in the GS-5 and GS-7 government pay scales will beraised 20 percent, while those at then GS-9 level will receive a 13percent increase.   The workers, whose jobs are seasonal, now get about $290 a weekat the GS-5 level, $360 a week at GS-7, and $440 a week at GS-9.   Gilles said USDA asked the Office of Personnel Management on Aug.25 for a 20 percent increase across the board, but received approvalfor only the three lower pay scales. Raises for graders at thehigher levels of GS-11 and GS-12 were denied. They currently receiveabout $533 and $638 per week, respectively.   ``This pay increase will make it easier for USDA to recruit andmaintain its quality tobacco grading work force,'' Gilles said.   About 260 tobacco graders work for the department's AgriculturalMarketing Service. An agency spokesman, George Clarke, said theirsalaries are paid from user fees and not taxpayer funds.   Federal employees are scheduled for a 4.1 percent pay increase onJan. 1, 1989, and all tobacco graders _ including the ones receivingNov. 6 increases _ will share in that one, the agency said.</TEXT></DOC>
