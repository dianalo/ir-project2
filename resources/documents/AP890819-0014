(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two children who were spirited from NewHampshire to Montana by their mother after her ex-husband wasacquitted of sexually molesting their daughter must be returned toNew England, a judge ruled Friday.   Rockingham County Superior Court Judge Douglas Gray ruled thatJesse and Mark Murabito's 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter beplaced in a New Hampshire foster home pending a hearing Sept. 1.   Mrs. Murabito's attorney, Alan Rosenfeld, criticized Gray'sdecision on a petition by Murabito, and said he would try to obtainan emergency order to keep the children in Fort Denton, Montana.   Mrs. Murabito, 40, contends the children would be in danger ifthey lived with her 34-year-old ex-husband at his home in Derry.   In November, after Murabito was found innocent in the sexualabuse case, his ex-wife disappeared with the children and began aneight-month journey to Loma via an ``underground railway'' thathelps women in such situations.   Murabito later was awarded custody.   Last week, Montana authorities, tipped that Mrs. Murabito wasliving in Loma under a false name, took the children from her.Montana District Judge John Warner ordered on Thursday that thechildren be kept in a state foster home until New Hampshire courtscalled for their return.   Gray said Friday that Montana authorities must deliver thechildren to Exeter County sheriff's officers at Logan Airport inBoston. They then will be taken to a foster home in New Hampshire,where all parental visits will be supervised.   The children, who are in Fort Denton, will not be placed witheither parent pending the Superior Court hearing next month.   Murabito did not return telephone calls from The AssociatedPress, and his lawyer, Raymond Kellett Jr. of Salem, could not bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
