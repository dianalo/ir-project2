Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sounded upbeat Monday aboutprospects for a peace settlement, saying a ``golden opportunity''exists that must not be squandered.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has been campaigninghard for a more flexible Israeli position on the issue, said Israelshould not feel threatened by the 10-point proposal for peace talksset forth by Mubarak.   The inner cabinet of ministers from Likud and Labor is to meetThursday on Mubarak's ideas amid deep divisions on how to proceed.   Likud rejects Mubarak's acceptance of a U.S.-backed formula thatinvolves trading occupied land for peace and including peopledeported by Israel in a Palestinian negotiating delegation. Labor,led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, supports both ideas.   Mubarak told reporters the essential next step in the peaceprocess is to persuade the Israelis and the Palestinians to enter adialogue ``without preconditions.''   ``We won't get to peace until Palestinians and Israelis speak toeach other,'' Baker said.   Baker regards the Egyptian plan as a complement to _ not asubstitite for _ Shamir's proposal for elections in whichPalestinians would select representatives to negotiate with Israelon limited self-government in the occupied territories.   Monday's White House session came amid new concern that settlingJewish immigrants from the Soviet Union in the Israeli-occupiedWest Bank could threaten peace efforts.   Bush administration officials reacted coolly to an Israelirequest for $400 million in housing loan guarantees for about100,000 Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union. Israeli officialshave said some dwellings probably will be in the West Bank.   ``The United States policy is to oppose additional settlementsin the occupied territories,'' Baker said.   Baker also said U.S. ability to assist Israel is limited by``severe budgetary constraints.''</TEXT></DOC>
