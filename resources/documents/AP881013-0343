But Brazilian officials said such fears were unfounded.   On other exchanges, cotton futures soared; soybeans movedsharply higher, pulling grain futures along; livestock and meatfutures were mostly higher; energy futures rose; precious metalsretreated; and stock-index futures advanced.   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures began the session on alow note due to a greater-than-expected Florida production estimatein the Agriculture Department's first forecast of the season andbeneficial overnight rains in Brazil.   But rumors surfaced at mid-morning that, for unknown reasons,Brazil might have trouble meeting its delivery commitments and abuying binge commenced.   ``The market shot up extremely strongly,'' said Judith Ganes, ananalyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   The contract for November delivery of frozen concentrated orangejuice skyrocketed to its permitted limit of 10 cents a pound, whichforced a 30-minute trading halt in accordance with the exchange'srules, she said.   Florida commercial players turned sellers when trading resumed,analysts said. The November price dropped sharply but climbed backlater in the session to finish at $1.8865 a pound, 7.75 cents aboveWednesday's settlement price.   Ms. Ganes said she had learned that a fire at the Bank of Brazilin Rio de Janeiro may have destroyed some documents pertaining tothe orange juice business.   ``However, I feel that in no way should that affect Brazil'sability to deliver orange juice,'' she said.   Brazilian citrus traders and government officials reportedlysaid shipments of frozen concentrated orange juice were movingnormally. A fire destroyed the import-export branch of the Bank ofBrazil in Rio but that did not affect the issuing of licenses,according to bank officials.   Cotton for delivery in December and March soared the2-cents-a-pound limit on technical factors and on talk of Chinesebuying, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential-BacheSecurities in New York.   December cotton settled at 55.75 cents a pound.   Soybean futures surged on the Chicago Board of Trade on rumorsthat the Soviet Union might have bought 200,000 metric tons of U.S.soybean meal, analysts said.   Soybean meal for near-month delivery surged more than $7 a tonwhile most soybean contracts gained more than 20 cents a bushel,pushing the price for November delivery well above $8. Most of thebuying came late in the session after talk of the possible Sovietpurchase surfaced.   Grain futures closed mostly higher on spillover buying from thesoybean complex, he said.   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at$4.35\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with Decemberat $2.97\ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher withDecember at $2.57{ a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 22 centshigher with November at $8.12 a bushel.   Frozen pork belly futures finished sharply higher on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange as traders bought contracts in reaction to anexchange report showing some movement of bellies out of storagelast week, analysts said.   The market had been expecting more bellies to be placed in coldstorage, said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with ThomsonMcKinnon Securities Inc.   Higher cash prices also boosted the pork complex while thecattle market finished mixed in directionless trading.
