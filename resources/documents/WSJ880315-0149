But little notice has been given to new regulatory efforts that could have equally profound effects on the industry's structure. They are separate attempts to set international standards for regulating banks and securities firms.    Efforts to &quot;globalize&quot; securities regulation are still in their infancy but received a boost from the world-wide October stockmarket crash. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder earlier this month attended a meeting of the 10-nation &quot;Wilton Park Group&quot; of securities regulators in England for preliminary discussions. A technical committee has been put to work.    International banking regulation, on the other hand, is well advanced. Recommendations were issued in December by the &quot;Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices.&quot; Represented were bank supervisors from the U.S., U.K., Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg.    Many bankers have greeted the new rules with dismay. Some believe that if the Federal Reserve applies them in the U.S. as written, they could shrink the size of the big &quot;money center&quot; banks and hasten the development of regional banking.    &quot;It's a very complex thing and it has almost been solved too easily,&quot; says Walter Shipley, chairman of New York's Chemical Bank. &quot;Most of us were supportive of trying to drive toward some kind of a level playing field, but you've got accounting, tax and other conventions that are so different from one country to the next that it becomes very difficult to do.&quot;    Central-bank representatives in the Basle group wanted banks to increase their capital bases to provide a better cushion for depositors against any need to write down shaky developing-nation debts. Major banks around the world carry large accounts with each other, so the failure of one can have repercussions for all. But boosting capital is expensive and it was felt that all big banks should be subject to the same rules so that no nation could let its banks shirk and thereby gain an advantage in competing for loans.    The problem, as Mr. Shipley says, is complicated by the different ways banking has evolved in different countries. Japanese and German banks, for example, can own stock in industrial companies, whereas U.S. banks cannot. Stockholdings are a form of capital, yet the Basle agreement limits their inclusion as capital. A recent article in the Japan Economic Journal makes clear that Japanese banks are unhappy with the pact. It will require them to either restrict lending or issue large amounts of new stock. Some have suspicions that it is part of efforts to limit Japanese banking in Europe.    That might be one effect, but a simpler explanation is that the central bankers at Basle struck a compromise. One thing all could agree about was that common stock is capital. So regulators decided that by 1992 all banks under their supervision would be required to have common stock issued and outstanding equal to at least 4% of assets (loans).    They then created a &quot;second tier&quot; for other forms of capital to provide a further 4%. It could include, for example, the outstanding preferred stock of U.S. banks. But loan-loss reserves of the type most U.S. money-center banks set aside against their LDC debt last spring may account for no more than 1.25% of total assets. Good will, acceptable as capital under Generally Accepted Accounting Practices, may not be counted at all.    These are technical rules, but they have implications for the future structure of banking, particularly in the U.S. with its complex arrangement of national banks, state banks, investment banks, savings banks and government-backed banks. One consequence could be that the big U.S. money-center banks, which account for something like 30% of U.S. bank assets, will have the difficult choice of issuing more common stock in a soft market, curtailing their loan growth, or both, thereby leaving the field for expansion to regional banks. The inability to count good will as capital also could put them at a competitive disadvantage to non-banking companies in mergers and acquisitions at a time when a major restructuring of the financial-services industry is under way.    &quot;Three years ago, we bought the Continental Illinois credit-card business in a bidding process,&quot; says Mr. Shipley of Chemical. &quot;We bid $176 million and Chase and First Chicago bid $175 million and other banks bid less. A credit-card business is mostly good will. If we were bidding for that against an American Express and good will were deducted from our equity base, there's no way in the world we could compete with American Express.&quot;    He continues: &quot;Let me give you the global level playing field problem. The best performer among U.S. money-center banks is Morgan. Its stock is selling for 140% to 150% of book value and it's yielding 4% to 5%. By contrast, the best of Japanese banks would have a yield of less than 1%, but because the Japanese investor attitude is different, Japanese bank stocks sell at four to five times book value. It's easy for the Japanese banks to sell common stock but not for U.S. banks.    &quot;So just saying that common equity at 4% is a level playing field means it is only level in regulatory requirements. When you get to the differences in different countries, which range from the Japanese and U.S. stock-market differences to the fact that reserving in Germany and Switzerland is tax deductible but not in the U.S., merely saying 4% equity is not sufficient.&quot;    Indeed, the Chemical CEO believes that the 1.25% rule for loan-loss reserves will be a disincentive to create such reserves. &quot;We have 4.15% of assets in our loan-loss reserve,&quot; says Mr. Shipley, &quot;meaning that 2.9% of our loan-loss reserve is not tier one, not tier two, it's nothing. Before we created the reserve it was equity. We will be motivated to bring down the reserve because we are giving up something that counts as zero for, in effect, pure gold.&quot;    Writing in American Banker last month, Washington banking consultant Karen D. Shaw argued that given the high costs of raising equity, U.S. money-center banks could &quot;diminish in size and become more like the up-and-coming regional banks.&quot; An argument of course could be made that such a result would be desirable in that it would reduce the danger of huge earthshaking bank failures. But Ms. Shaw also sees a danger that, &quot;just when technology and telecommunications create a global banking environment, the United States will create a Balkanized banking system within its own borders.&quot;    The Fed is, of course, listening to such arguments. The Basle agreement gives central banks some flexibility in defining capital. There is a possibility that the Fed will ease up on some of the requirements, perhaps, for example, allowing banks to count preferred stock as primary equity. But one thing is certain. Creating a level playing field in the international financial-services market is indeed not a simple task. It is even worth asking the question whether international banking will become safer and more efficient, or less so, as a result of this new experiment in regulation. </TEXT></DOC>
