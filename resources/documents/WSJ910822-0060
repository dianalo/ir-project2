Grain prices were pushed up on speculation that Westernnations might expand their economic assistance to the SovietUnion as a reward for thwarting the rightwing coup.</LP><TEXT>   At the Chicago Board of Trade, prices of corn futuresjumped their daily permissible limit of 10 cents a bushel.Most soybean contracts rose their daily permissible limit of30 cents a bushel. Wheat futures climbed 14 cents to 18 centsa bushel.   World oil prices plunged on evaporating worries of supplydisruptions in the Soviet Union, the world's largest oilproducer. Some fuel prices fell more than four cents agallon. Crudes were down as much as $1 a barrel. The sharpdeclines effectively erased the coup-driven gains earlier inthe week.   &quot;The market has given up all of Monday's `coup' premium,&quot;said Grant Hopkins, a senior adviser to Petroleum Finance Co.   Grain prices fell on Monday and Tuesday on fears that theU.S. and other nations would suspend billions of dollars inaid if the coup leaders stayed in power. The economicallyailing Soviet Union is one of the biggest customers of U.S.farmers, but it depends on U.S. credit guarantees to importcrops.   The failed coup could pay dividends, traders speculated.Although the Bush administration hasn't made any proposals,farm state legislators are already preparing to argue thatthe U.S. should do more to prop up Soviet reformers.   &quot;This gives us an opportunity to be more aggressive aboutdeveloping our grain exports,&quot; said Rep. Dan Glickman,chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,soybeans and feed grains.   Congress is expected to overwhelmingly approve theU.S.-Soviet trade treaty that would give most-favored-nationstatus to Moscow. The pact already had broad support beforethe takeover attempt.   Most-favored-nation status by itself won't greatlyincrease U.S. exports to the Soviet Union. But it isimportant to Moscow because it had been denied for yearsbecause of objections to its emigration policy. Most U.S.trading partners have most-favored-nation status, whichensures the U.S.'s best treatment on tariffs and quotas.   Some grain export officials said euphoria generated by thecoup's collapse will make it easier to push Congress for moregrain-buying aid for the Soviet Union.   &quot;Over the next several months we'll see a whole host ofproposals for additional assistance to the Soviet Union,&quot;predicted Steve McCoy, president of the North American ExportGrain Association, which represents exporters.   &quot;The American people are impressed. This is the revengefor Tiananmen Square,&quot; Mr. McCoy said, referring to theChinese government's move in 1989 to crush a democraticmovement.   But grain traders are also mulling whether a wave ofpatriotism in the Soviet Union might motivate farmers thereto be more cooperative. For the past two years, many Sovietfarmers have preferred to barter their crops with neighborsfor supplies rather than sell their crops to the government-- making it difficult for state officials to meet theirproduction goals.   In the oil market, heating oil led the retreat in futurestrading, setting a volume record for the second day in a rowwith 64,328 contracts traded.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil forSeptember delivery declined 4.52 cents a gallon to settle at61.80 cents. October heating oil fell 4.20 cents to 62.74cents.   Even bigger plunges occurred on the InternationalPetroleum Exchange in London where gas oil, as heating oil isknown in Europe, is traded. In volatile trading, gas oilfutures ended the day down as much as $20.50 a metric ton.   U.S. crude oil prices fell in spot and futures markets aswell as in the oil fields. On the New York Merc, crude oilfor October delivery dropped 85 cents a barrel to settle at$21.55. In the oil fields, leading U.S. refiners beganreducing their postings for West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark crude, by 75 cents a barrel to $20.25.   Oil markets should head &quot;back to normal&quot; now, said JohnHill, vice president with Merrill Lynch's energy trading deskin New York. As a result, he said, the U.S. crude shouldtrade again in a range of $20 to $23 a barrel.   Barring &quot;unforeseen military repercussions&quot; in the SovietUnion, Mr. Hopkins said, oil markets should now begin torefocus on such fundamentals as &quot;the API stats.&quot; In thefrantic trading that has taken place in the wake of SovietPresident Gorbachev's brief ouster, oil markets had ignoredthe American Petroleum Institute's latest figures on U.S. oilinventories, which were considered bullish for crude oil andgasoline but neutral for heating oil.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rallied. Copper for Septemberdelivery ended 1.55 cents a pound higher at $1.0065. SteveSavitsky, a trader at Sharps Pixley, attributed the rise toshort-covering. Traders cover their short positions -- betsthe price will fall -- by buying offsetting contracts. Unionsat Codelco's El Teniente mine in Chile reached a settlementyesterday but copper prices didn't fall because the accordwas expected, he said. The turn of events in the Soviet Unionyesterday relieved some worries about the coup's effect onthe economy, he added. Prices are still within their recentnarrow range of 98.5 cents to $1.02, and probably will remainthere through the end of the month, he predicted. If pricesdon't fall below that range, he added, they could go higherin September when Japanese and U.S. buying picks up.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices strengthened. Coffee for Septemberdelivery ended at 78.50 cents a pound, up 0.70 cent. Theactively traded December contract gained 1.05 cents to finishat 82.55 cents. Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers, said skepticism is waning about plans by producersto withhold coffee from the market as a way to boost prices.Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala andpossibly Mexico are arranging private funding rather thanWorld Bank financing for their plan to withhold at least 10%of their exportable coffee, Ms. Kaul said. Brazil said itmight withhold more than 10%, she added. Perceptions ofprogress being made on the producers' plans discouragedselling, she said. Also, roasters typically step up coffeeprocessing after July, ahead of a pickup in consumptionduring autumn. As a result, inventories should be drawn downfaster, and, if producers are able to successfully implementtheir export-withholding plan, some supply concerns couldstart to develop, Ms. Kaul said.</TEXT></DOC>
