The decision by a panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals appears to broaden the grounds under which officialscan be sanctioned for brutality. According to the ruling,police departments must go beyond merely instructing academystudents about the mechanics of applying force. They mustalso educate officers about continuing developments in thelaw.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling comes amid an outcry over the videotapedbeating of a man by Los Angeles police officers two weeksago. Stephen Yagman, a New York and Los Angeles civil-rightslawyer, called the ruling &quot;the most important decision forplaintiffs in civil-rights police cases in 15 years.&quot; Headded, &quot;This decision is an incredible bit of socialengineering by the court because when police organizationsrealize that they are going to be held liable for damageswhen they don't give legal training, it's going to cause asignificant decrease in the instances in which policeofficers will use force.&quot;   The court's ruling upheld jury verdicts totaling more than$582,000 against Mason County, Wash., its former sheriff andseveral deputies for using excessive force on four occasions.   In one incident, a deputy pulled aside a man for allegedlydriving too fast, then commenced a &quot;pat-down search&quot; thatincluded kicks to the groin and blows to the man's sides.Lawyers for the sheriffs in the case declined to comment.   The court faulted not only the acts themselves, but thedepartments' educational policies. &quot;The issue is not whetherthe officers had received any training -- most of thedeputies involved had some training, even if it was minimalat best -- rather the issue is the adequacy of the training,&quot;Judge Harry Pregerson wrote for the 2-1 majority.   &quot;Moreover, while they may have received some training inthe use of force, they received no training in theconstitutional limits of the use of force,&quot; the judge said.   Hubert Williams, director of the Washington-based PoliceFoundation, a research organization, said that policedepartments will now have to &quot;make sure every officer has acopy of the latest rulings. And if someone can show that anofficer doesn't have the instructions and doesn't know theparameters of the law, that department may be exposed to someheavy money damages.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
