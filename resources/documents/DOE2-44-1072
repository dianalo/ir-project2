The hypothesis-dependentmaps reflecting the current forest condition of a given area can be comparedwith the real course of damage either by in-situ inspection or by aerialphotographs; as a result, previous years can also be rated by comparingolder records and aerial photographs. This methodology provides for animmediate, differentiated and small-area comparison of any hypotheticalstatement with reality.</TEXT></DOC>
