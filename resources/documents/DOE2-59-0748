It is shown,that many factors, the basic of which are the precipitation activityfor the equipment, washed by radioactive liquid media and the repairscope, effect on the formation of personnel dose costs during NPP operation.Published results on DC investigation are analyzed. It is recommendedto use NPP operation effective time instead of calendar one to investigatecharacter of DC dependence on time. 6 refs.; 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
