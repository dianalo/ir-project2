The Center for Innovative Technology, formally dedicated fiveyears after being chartered by the state General Assembly, displayeda dozen center-supported projects, including a computer operatedwith eye movements and a bed designed to benefit both hospitalpatients and insomniacs.   Reporters attending an open house Tuesday in advance of Wednesdaynight's official dedication of the $34.5 million center also wereshown a fiber-optic sensing system designed to warn of aircraftvibrations or help make submarines quieter and a device that allowshandwritten data to be entered into a computer.   There was a fire-extinguishing system for computers;electromagnetic bearings that can replace traditional lubricatingsystems for machines; a briefcase-size computer workstation andfacsimile machine that can send encrypted messages by cellulartelephone; and a testing kit to find bacterial infections in milkcows.   The controversial center, which symbolizes the nationwide push bystate legislatures to attract and hold high-technology businesses,is located in an inverted pyramid-shaped building near WashingtonDulles International Airport.   It has been under fire since 1984, when Virginia lawmakersapproved a plan by then-Gov. Charles Robb to establish a non-profitfacility to link private enterprise with the state's college anduniversity research programs.   The center has had four presidents in as many years, investingmore than $37 million in research projects while attracting nearly$56 million in matching funds from private industry and othersources.   Its 1988-90 budget is $27.2 million and it is seeking $41.6million for 1991-1993. It has a staff of 30.   Critics say its mission remains unfocused, it is too costly andsecretive, and that the money could better be spent by Virginiaeducational institutions.   Its president, former Virginia Gov. Linwood Holton, said Tuesdayhe thinks the center is ``over that hump.''   But Holton acknowledged there is an image problem caused as thecenter tries to balance being accountable to taxpayers with notrevealing trade secrets that have potentially high economic values.   CIT officials say nearly 400 companies have been persuaded toco-sponsor more than 450 research projects, including the Eyegazecomputer system developed by LC Technologies of Fairfax, Va., basedon research at the University of Virginia.   The machine costs between $32,000 and $68,000, and two have beensold to disabled individuals. A third was sold to the VirginiaDepartment of Rehabilitative Services. CIT received a $1,600 royaltycheck from one of the private sales, Holton said.   Eyegaze looks like a personal computer, but uses a camera systemthat interprets the eye movements of the operator. By focusingbriefly on a keyboard on the computer screen, a user may typemessages, open or close files or gain access to IBM-compatiblesoftware.   Eye movements also will operate household appliances such aslights and televisions with LC Technologies software that links themachine with off-the-shelf mechanical hardware.   Another invention, the Good Turn Bed, can contort into sevendifferent positions to relieve patient suffering, or it can aidinsomniacs by continually moving to reduce tossing and turningduring sleep.   The center also has helped develop a machine that harvestscucumbers without bruising them and a process to remove pollutingsulfur from coal.</TEXT></DOC>
