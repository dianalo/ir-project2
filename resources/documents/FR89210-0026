The estimated weighted-averagemargins are shown in the ``Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>On September 23, 1988, we made an affirmative preliminary determination(53 FR 38045, September 29, 1988). The following events have occurred sincethe publication of that notice.The questionnaire responses from Sony Corporation (Sony) were verifiedin Japan between October 3 and October 7, and in the United States fromOctober 24 through October 26, 1988.The questionnaire responses from Hitachi Maxell, Ltd. (Hitachi) were verifiedin Japan from October 6 through October 14, 1988, and in the United Stateson October 27 and October 28.The questionnaire responses from Fuji Photo Film Company, Ltd. (Fuji) wereverified in Japan from October 3 through October 7, and in the United Statesfrom October 19 through October 21.On November 1, 1988, the Department postponed the date of the final determinationto February 6, 1989 (53 FR 44933, November 7, 1988), at the request ofone of the respondents, as provided for in section 735(a)(2)(A) of theAct.On December 7, 1988, the Department held a public hearing. Interested partiesalso submitted comments for the record in their pre-hearing briefs of November30, 1988, and in their post-hearing briefs of December 15, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), as provided for in section 1201et seq. of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandiseentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after thisdate is now classified solely according to the HTS item numbers. As withthe TSUSA numbers, the HTS numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The written description remains dispositive as to the scope ofthe product coverage.The products covered by this investigation are 3.5andmin16;andmin16; microdisksand coated media thereof from Japan and are currently provided for undersubheading 8523.20.0000 of the HTS. These products were previously providedfor in item 724.4570 of the TSUSA.A 3.5andmin16;andmin16; microdisk is a tested or untested magnetically coatedpolyester disk with a steel hub encased in a hard plastic jacket. 3.5andmin16;andmin16;microdisks are used to record and store encoded digital computer informationfor access by 3.5andmin16;andmin16; floppy disk drive. They include single-sided,double-sided or high density formats.Coated media is the flexible recording material used in the finished microdisk.Media consists of a polyester base film to which a coating of magneticallycharged particles is bonded. It is intended for use specifically in a 3.5andmin16;andmin16;floppy disk drive.Respondents have argued that the merchandise included in the scope of investigationconstitutes four separate ``classes of kinds'' of merchandise, namely 3.5andmin16;andmin16;double density (DD) media, 3.5andmin16;andmin16; high density (HD) media, 3.5andmin16;andmin16;DD microdisks and 3.5andmin16;andmin16; HD microdisks. In our preliminary determination,the Department found that these products constitute one ``class or kind''of merchandise. After carefully reviewing this issue, we have found noreason to alter this decision. In determining that 3.5andmin16;andmin16; coatedmedia (both DD and HD) and 3.5andmin16;andmin16; finished microdisks (bothDD and HD) are of the same ``class or kind'' of merchandise, we have consideredthe following factors: 1) The physical characteristics of the merchandise;2) the expectations of the ultimate purchasers; 3) the ultimate use ofthe merchandise; 4) the channels of trade in which the merchandise moves;and 5) the manner in which the merchandise is advertised and displayed.The Court of International Trade has endorsed these criteria in determiningwhether a product is within the ``class or kind'' of merchandise describedin a prior antidumping finding (See <T3>Diversified Products Corp. v. United States, </T3>572 F. Supp. 883(Court of International Trade 1983)).The media is the physical and technological heart of the 3.5andmin16;andmin16;microdisk and its format and material properties define the functionalcharacteristics of the microdisk. The media alone receives bits of dataduring the recording process from direct contact with the head of the drive.In addition, the 3.5andmin16;andmin16; media is dedicated exclusively for usein the 3.5andmin16;andmin16; microdisk. In contrast to the media, the packagingparts added during finishing are not electromagnetically active. They aremerely the housing in which the electromagnetically active component isencased. Therefore, the Department does not find that the fact that 3.5andmin16;andmin16;media have, in some respectsd, different physical characteristics from3.5andmin16;andmin16; finished disks is controlling in this case. The importantfact here is that the 3.5andmin16;andmin16; media is the memory of the microdisk_itssole electromagnetically active component. Therefore, with respect to thefirst criterion, we determine that the characteristics of the 3.5andmin16;andmin16;media and microdisk are the same.Because the media is the physical and technological heart of the microdiskand because 3.5andmin16;andmin16; media is dedicated for use exclusively inthe 3.5andmin16;andmin16; microdisk, both the ultimate use and the expectationsof the ultimate purchaser of the 3.5andmin16;andmin16; media are the same asfor the 3.5andmin16;andmin16; finished microdisk, thus satisfying both thesecond and the third criteria cited above (See <T3>Mitsubishi Electronic Corp. v. United States, </T3>Slip op. 88-152(Court of International Trade, October 31, 1988).In terms of the fourth criterion, 3.5andmin16;andmin16; media and 3.5andmin16;andmin16;finished microdisks move in the same channels of trade. Although mediamust be further manufactured for use as finished microdisks, there is noother use for media in the floppy disk industry. Many U.S. importers purchaseboth 3.5andmin16;andmin16; media and 3.5andmin16;andmin16; finished disks for resaleto the ultimate end-user.As for the fifth criterion, because 3.5andmin16;andmin16; media are used exclusivelyin the production of 3.5andmin16;andmin16; finished microdisks, the only mannerin which they are advertised and displayed is in the form of finished microdisks.There is no separate advertising of media.Based upon this analysis, the Department concludes that 3.5andmin16;andmin16;media and 3.5andmin16;andmin16; microdisks are within the same ``class or kind''of merchandise.The Department also determines that 3.5&quot; DD media and microdisks and 3.5&quot;HD media and microdisks are within the same ``class or kind'' of merchandise.3.5&quot; DD media and microdisks and 3.5&quot; HD media and microdisks are practicallyidentical with respect to format size, design technology, production processes,packaging, uses and channels of trade. The fact that HD media and microdiskshave more capacity and are higher performance items than DD media and microdisksrepresents a refinement_rather than a major shift_in microdisk media technology.There is no difference in physical appearance or characteristics betweenthe DD and HD microdisk. The coating formulations of the DD and HD mediaand microdisks are similar and the same microdisk coating equipment isused for DD and HD microdisk production. Furthermore, DD disks can be usedin HD drives and, because DD disks are much cheaper, HD drive owners continueto buy and use DD disks. Most dealers and distributors have expanded theirportfolios to include HD as well as DD disks. Therefore, the first andthird criteria cited above are met.DD and HD microdisks are also within the same class or kind of merchandisein terms of channels of trade, advertising, and consumer expectations.The introduction of HD drives has created demand for both HD and DD disks,because DD disks can be used in both HD and DD drives. HD drive ownersuse DD microdisks for software and data storage purposes, for specificdata or programming needs that can be filled readily by the less expensiveDD disks and for data interchange with DD drive users. There is, therefore,a very basic inter-generational continuity that links the DD and the HDformats.As a result of its analysis, the Department concludes that DD media andmicrodisks and HD media and microdisks are within the same ``class or kind''of merchandise.Petitioner requested in the petition that we include within the scope ofthis investigation coated media produced in Japan and finished into 3.5&quot;microdisks in third countries prior to importation into the United States.In our notice of initiation, the Department tentatively agreed to includesuch imports. However, based on the arguments presented by a Canadian microdiskfinisher, Kao-Didak, we preliminarily determined to include from the scopeof this investigation third country imports of finished microdisks containingJapanese media.We verified the submissions of Kao-Didak and confirmed the following factswhich had served as the basis of our preliminary determination: (1) Inthe finishing process currently used by Kao-Didak, burnishing is extremelyimportant to the technical performance levels of the finished microdiskbecause burnishing affects the surface characteristics and electromagneticproperties of the media; (2) Kao-Didak's finishing process requires a substantialcapital outlay and an extremely high degree of technical precision; (3)the facilities used by Kao-Didak to perform these operations representan investment in state-of-the-art equipment and the employment of highlytrained technical personnel; (4) the value of the Japanese media is onlya small fraction of the value of the microdisk finished in the processused by Kao-Didak; and (5) the capital and technology intensive natureof Kao-Didak's finishing process indicates that media finishing of thekind performed by Kao-Didak is not the type of operation that can be setup and undertaken easily in any country. Given these verified facts, wehave concluded that when Japanese media is finished in Canada by Kao-Didakin this manner, the finished microdisk becomes a product of Canada forcountry-of-origin purposes under the antidumping law, and thus is not withinthe scope of this investigation. (In this regard, we note that the determinationsof ``class or kind'' and the country-of-origin involve two separate inquiries.)The process for finishing media currently used by Kao-Didak is readilydistinguishable from the relatively simple assembly process that was usedby third country product assemblers in the <T3>Erasable Programmable Read Only Memories (EPROMs) from Japan; FinalDetermination of Sales at Less than Fair Value,</T3> 51 FR 39680, 39685(October 30, 1986). In EPROMs, once the semiconductor dice left Japan,they possessed all the essential qualities to function in a commerciallyreliable manner, and none of the operations performed in Singapore affectedthe character or performance of the dice themselves. Product assemblersin Singapore merely encapsulated the Japanese-produced semiconductor dicein a relatively unsophisticated operation which required little capitalinvestment in Singapore and which could have been accomplished relativelyeasily in any country. Therefore, we determined that this relatively superficialfinishing of EPROM semiconductors did not transform these products intoproducts of Singapore for country-of-origin purposes under the antidumpinglaw.In contrast to EPROMs, the media is first burnished at Kao-Didak priorto its integration with other components. Burnishing involves rotatingthe coated media through a burnishing tape to remove surface defects aswell as dust and scratches. By achieving optimum surface smoothness, burnishingensures that the microdisk will be a commercially reliable product. Thisprocessing of the media itself is not a simple assembly process which leavesthe magnetic disk unchanged. Rather, it constitutes a significant manufacturingstep and is critical to our determination that the country-of-origin isCanada.Following our preliminary determination, petitioner identified certainmicrodisk finishers in other third countries which allegedly employ a processsubstantially more labor-intensive than the type of operation employedby Kao-Didak. However, no facts have yet been presented or verified thatwould enable us to substantiate the allegations regarding the operationsin other third countries at this time. Should this investigation lead tothe issuance of an antidumping duty order, and an interested party bringsto our attention information on imports of 3.5&quot; microdisks incorporatingJapanese media from a finisher other than Kao-Didak, we will examine suchimports to determine whether the process by which they were finished providesa basis for their inclusion in the scope of the order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standing</ITAG>The respondents have argued that the petitioner, Verbatim Corporation (Verbatim),has no standing to file a petition against 3.5&quot; microdisks because (1)it has not established that it has the support of the relevant industry,defined as a majority of the producers of the like product, 19 U.S.C. 1677(4)(A);and (2) Verbatim does not qualify as a manufacturer or producer of the``like product'' under subparagraphs (C), (D) or (E) of 19 U.S.C. 1677(9).With regard to the question of whether Verbatim has the support of therelevant industry, the statutory provision governing the standing of partiesto bring petitions requires the commencement of an investigation ``wheneveran intereted party * * * files a petition * * * on behalf of an industry''(section 732(b)(1) of the Act). As we have stated in prior cases (see <T3>e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: CertainElectrical Conductor Aluminum Redraw Rod from Venezuela,</T3> 53 FR 24755(June 30, 1988)), the Department relies upon the petitioner's representationthat it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is affirmativelyshown that a majority of the domestic industry opposes the petition. TheDepartment bases this position on the fact that neither the Act nor itslegislative history restricts access to the unfair trade laws by requiringthat parties petitioning for relief under these laws establish affirmativelythat a majority of the members of the relevant domestic industry supportsthe petition. The only requirement is that the party filing the petitionact as the representative of the domestic industry.In this case, no member of the domestic industry has objected to the petition.Only respondents have raised the issue. Absent evidence of opposition tothe petition by members of the domestic industry, the Department has nobasis to conclude that a majority of the industry opposed the petition.Therefore, the Department finds that Verbatim has filed on behalf of thedomestic industry.We also find that Verbatim is an interested party with respect to 3.5&quot;microdisks and coated media thereof, because Verbatim produces 3.5&quot; DDmedia, which is within the same class or kind of merchandise as 3.5&quot; DDmicrodisks and 3.5&quot; HD media and microdisks.Although the parties submitted various arguments on the standing issue,we have not received sufficient evidence to reach a decision contrary tothat in our preliminary determination. Furthermore, we placed great importanceon the ITC's finding of one like product and one industry when formulatingour preliminary determination. Accordingly, should the ITC find in itsfinal determination more than one like product, we will consider the issueof whether Verbatim has standing with respect to each of the ITC's likeproduct categories. Such an analysis would take into account Verbatim'sactivities as a manufacturer, producer or wholesaler for each of thoselike products. If we determine at that time that Verbatim lacks standingfor any of the like products, we will rescind the initiation of this investigationas it pertains to those products.In conclusion, the Department reaffirms its preliminary determination inthis case that the petitioner has standing to bring this petition. Ourdetermination is based on the fact that (1) Verbatim produces a ``like''product; (2) Verbatim filed its petition on behalf of the microdisk industry;(3) no member of the domestic industry has objected to the petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The period of investigation for 3.5&quot; microdisks and coated media thereoffrom Japan was September 1, 1987 through February 29, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of 3.5&quot; microdisks and coated media thereoffrom Japan in the United States were made at less than fair value, we comparedthe United States price (using both purchase price and exporter's salesprice) with the foreign market value. Virtually all of the respondents'sales to the United States were used for such or similar comparisons.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>Purchase PriceAs provided in section 772(b) of the Act, we used the purchase price torepresent the United States price for sales of 3.5&quot; microdisks and coatedmedia thereof where sales were made to an unrelated purchaser prior toimportation of the product into the United States. We calculated purchaseprice based on packed F.O.B. prices. We made deductions, where appropriate,for foreign inland freight and insurance and foreign brokerage and handling.Exporter's Sales PriceFor all exporter's sales price sales, the subject merchandise was importedinto the United States by a related importer before being sold to the firstunrelated party.To calculate exporter's sales price in accordance with section 772(c) ofthe Act, we used the packed, delivered, duty paid prices of 3.5&quot; microdisksand coated media thereof to unrelated purchasers in the United States.We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight and insurance,foreign brokerage and handling charges, ocean/air freight, marine/air insurance,U.S. duty, U.S. brokerage and handling charges, U.S. inland freight insurance,discounts and allowances, rebates and price protection.We made deductions under andSection; 353.10(e)(2) of our regulations fordirect and indirect selling expenses incurred by or for the account ofthe exporter in selling 3.5&quot; microdisks and coated media thereof in theUnited States. Direct selling expenses were deducted for U.S. credit, warranties,advertising, sales promotion and repacking for shipment to the customer.For Fuji and Sony, indirect selling expenses were comprised of indirectselling expenses incurred outside the United States, U.S. indirect sellingexpenses of the related reseller in the United States related commissionsand inventory carrying costs. For Hitachi, indirect selling expenses werecomprised of indirect selling expenses incurred outside the United States,U.S. indirect selling expenses of the related reseller in the United States,and inventory carrying costs. Pursuant to andSection; 353.10(e)(1) of ourregulations, we also deducted commissions paid to unrelated parties forall three respondents. The total of the indirect expenses and commissionsformed the cap for the allowable home market indirect selling expensesoffset under andSection; 353.15(c) of our regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on the packed, delivered or ex-works prices to related andunrelated customers in the home market. In our preliminary determination,we included sales to related customers, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(b), sincewe determined at that time that the prices paid by those customers werecomparable to the prices paid by unrelated customers. However, we saidat the time of the preliminary determination that ``if we were unable toascertain at verification that the prices to related and unrelated customersin the home market are comparable, we will use only the sales to unrelatedcustomers in calculating foreign market value in our final determination.''For Sony and Fuji, we verified that the net prices paid by related customersfor identical microdisk items were comparable to the prices paid by unrelatedcustomers; therefore, for purposes of the final determination, we haveincluded Sony and Fuji's sales to related customers in calculating theforeign market value. For Hitachi, we verified that the net prices paidby related customers are not at ``arms length''; therefore, we have notincluded Hitachi's sales to related customers in calculating the foreignmarket value in our final determination.We made deductions from the home market price, where appropriate, for inlandfreight and insurance, handling, cash discounts, rebates, ship and debitand price protection. We deducted the home market packing cost from theforeign market value and added U.S. packing costs. Where appropriate, we made further adjustments to the home market priceto account for differences in the merchandise due to differences in consumerpackaging, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act. For comparisons involving purchase price sales, we made adjustments tothe home market price, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses,advertising and promotion, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15. For comparisons involving exporter's sales price transactions, we madefurther deductions from the home market price, where appropriate, for creditexpenses, advertising and promotion. We deducted indirect selling expensesincurred on home market sales up to the amount of commissions and indirectselling expenses incurred on sales in the U.S. market, in accordance withandSection; 353.15(c) of our regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we used the officialexchange rates in effect on the dates of sale, in accordance with andSection;353.56(a)(1) of the Commerce Regulations. For comparisons involving exporter'ssales price transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effecton the dates of the sale, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act,as amended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Bank of NewYork. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified all information usedin reaching the final determination in this investigation. We used standardverification procedures, including examination of relevant accounting recordsand original source documents provided by the respondents. <ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments </ITAG>General Comments <T3>Comment 1:</T3> Respondents argue that, since Verbatim Corporationdid not produce microdisks in the United States at the time the petitionwas filed, it did not have standing as a U.S. producer of the ``like product.''Furthermore, respondents argue that Verbatim has not established that ithas the support of the relevant industry.  Petitioner argues that it has standing to file a petition that includesmicrodisks because it is a domestic producer of the ``like product'' inthis investigation. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We have determined that the petitioner has the requisitestanding, as discussed in the ``Standing'' section above. <T3>Comment 2:</T3> Petitioner argues that there is one class or kind ofmerchandise in this investigation, encompassing different density formatsof 3.5&quot; microdisks such as HD and DD. Respondents argue that the merchandise included in the scope of investigationas described in the initiation and preliminary determination notices constitutesfour separate classes or kinds of merchandise, DD media, DD microdisks,HD media, and HD microdisks. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We have determined the 3.5&quot; coasted DD and HD mediaand DD and HD Microdisks constitute the same class or kind of merchandise,as discussed in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Petitioner asserts that this investigation must beopen-ended with respct to future generations of 3.5&quot; microdisks. Petitionerstates that in determining whether merchandise developed after the issuanceof an antidumping order is included within that order, the Department'swell established practice is to perform a ``class or kind'' analysis. Thus,petitioner argues that any scope determination with respect to a futuregeneration of 3.5 microdisk must await the availability of the commercialand technical data necessary to such an analysis. Verbatim anticipatesthe development and commercialization of future generations of 3.5&quot; disksfeaturing greater memory capacity than 3.5&quot; formats now on the market.Verbatim further anticipates that these new formats and media will likelyfall within the product scope of the investigation, as defined by the Departmentin its Notice of Initiation product descriptions, and may well belong tothe same class or kind of merchandise as the imports subject to investigation.Therefore, it would be premature for the Department to exclude future generationmicrodisk products from the scope of the investigation before facts abouttheir development, distribution, and use are available. Respondents agree with petitioner that future generations of microdiskproducts should be left open. However, they assert that the scope of investigationlanguage as written in the initiation and preliminary determination istoo broad and would automatically include future generations of microdisks.They argue, therefore, that the Department would narrow the scope language.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree that it would be premature for the Departmentto exclude future generations of microdisks from the scope of this investigation.At this time, there exists no information about the development, distributionand use of future generation microdisk products on which the Departmentcould base such a determination. As for the issue of the scope of investigationlanguage, we determine that the description as written in the initiationand preliminary determination best describes the present product and thereforeneeds no revision. <T3>Comment 4:</T3> Respondents claimed that since petitioner did not allegeand the Department did not investigate less than fair value sales of media,media should be excluded from the scope of the investigation.Petitioner argues that it framed the petition to include both finishedmicrodisks and coated media thereof. Petitioner also states that it couldnot locate meaningful sales data pertaining to media and that the antidumpinglaws require a petitioner to include in its petition only such informationas is ``reasonably available'' to it. Moreover, petitioner claims thatthe Court of International Trade recently held that where unfinished andfinished goods belong to the same class or kind, the petitioner need notinclude in the petition ``inclusive information covering all the categoriesand subcategories for all those goods included'' in the class or kind subjectto investigation. Because media and finished microdisks belong to the sameclass or kind, Verbatim is not required to provide data on media sales.  <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with petitioner. Because the petition includesboth finished microdisks and coated media thereof and because we determinethat media and finished microdisks are the same class or kind of merchandise,it is not necessary for the petitioner to allege less than fair value saleson all the categories and subcategories of the same class or kind of merchandise(See <T3>Mitsubishi Electric Corp. v. United States, </T3>op. cit.).  <T3>Comment 5: </T3>Petitioner argues that exclusion of Japanese mediafinished in third countries from the scope of the investigation would beimproper and would result in widespread circumvention of any order issuedin this case. Petitioner also argues that any determination that finishingconstitutes substantial transformation must be made on a case-by-case basisbecause the technological sophistication involved and value-added in thecountry of finishing can vary appreciably. The Department should then include,on either a definitive or presumptive basis, imports of media from Japanfinished in third countries in the scope of this investigation.  Kao-Didak, Ltd., and respondents argue that the Department should continueto exclude Japanese media finished in third countries from the scope ofthe investigation. Kao-Didak argues that, at least, it has to be includedbecause its manufacturing operations are extensive and technically sophisticatedand account for the bulk of the value of the finished microdisks. Kao-Didakfurther argues that media is ``remanufactured'' in Canada through a ``burnishing''process that is itself a critical phase of production. Accordingly, Kao-Didak's3.5'' microdisks are properly labelled ``Made in Canada.''  <T3>Doc Position: </T3>We have verified Kao-Didak's submission, and weagree that Kao-Didak should be excluded from the scope of investigation.As for finishers in other third countries, no facts have been presentedor verified that would enable us to substantiate the allegations regardingthe operations in other third countries at this time. See the ``Scope ofInvestigation'' section of this notice.  Sony Comments  <T3>Comment 1: </T3>Sony believes the Department should treat home marketformatting as a direct expense or, alternatively, as a physical differencein merchandise. Sony states that formatting is done to specific disks forspecific customers. The cost of formatting was deducted from the sellingprice of each of these disks and this cost was verified.  Petitioner claims that the cost of formatting is a manufacturing cost andis properly treated as an indirect selling expense. Or, if Sony claimsthat formatted disks are only ``similar'' to nonformatted disks, then itcan claim an adjustment for differences in physical characteristics.  <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree that formatting should be treated as adifference in merchandise adjustment. However, because there are sufficientsales of identical merchandise in the home market to compare to the U.S.sales, we have dropped all formatted sales in the home market from ourcalculation of foreign market value.  <T3>Comment 2: </T3>Sony claims that the Department mistakenly treatedhome market technical service expenses as an indirect selling expense inits preliminary determination. Sony believes that this expense should betreated as a direct selling expense.  <T3>DOC Position: </T3>This expense was denied in the home market becauseit applies to sales prior to the period of investigation.  <T3>Comment 3: </T3>Sony believes that any deductions for warranty costson U.S. sales should also be made on the home market side. Sony statesthat it gives the same warranty on U.S. and home market microdisk salesand since the microdisks were produced at the same facility they shouldexperience the same failure rate. Sony states that, since its warrantycovers the microdisk for a lifetime, there are obviously home market warrantyexpenses incurred. However, these expenses are minimal and do not justifyelaborate recordkeeping. Sony America's (SONAM) U.S. experience is a reasonableproxy measure of the home market expense according to Sony.  Petitioner claims, however, that no data was obtained at verification tosupport Sony's claim for home market warranty expenses. According to petitioner,the information available indicates that there were no home market warrantyexpenses; therefore, the Department cannot make any assumptions about Sony'shome market warranty expenses based on Sony's experience in the U.S. market.Petitioner argues that the Department should continue to deny this adjustmentin the final determination.  <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with petitioner and have denied this expensein the home market, because Sony could not give us any data at verificationto support its claim for home market warranty.  <T3>Comment 4: </T3>Sony says that in the final determination the Departmentshould treat repackaging performed in the United States as either a packingexpense or a difference in merchandise adjustment. U.S.-side packing shouldbe treated as an adjustment to foreign market value, not as an adjustmentto U.S. price. Sony claims that repackaging performed in the United Statesis simply another part of ESP packing. <T3>DOC Position</T3>: We disagree. Repackaging is a direct selling expenseincurred in the United States on United States sales; therefore, we havededucted the expense directly from the U.S. price.<T3>Comment 5</T3>: Petitioner claims that it is the established practiceof the Department to allow adjustments for rebates only with respect tosales made during the period of investigation. According to petitioner,the verification report confirms that the microfloppy disk (MFD) rebatepaid by Sony to distributors was based on distributor resales of the productpreviously sold by Sony to the distributors. Petitioner believes that thisrebate should be allocated to those prior sales made by Sony to which therebate applies which occurred during the period of investigation. Petitionerargues that absent the information necessary to make this adjustment, theDepartment should disallow the MFD rebate to distributors.According to Sony, its rebate programs took two basic forms, payments topurchasers who purchased directly from Sony and payments to distributorsbased on the distributor's resales. For the first group, Sony could directlylink the payments with specific Sony sales. For the second group, Sonywas unable to tie distributor resales back to Sony sales to those distributorson a one-for-one basis.<T3>DOC Position</T3>: We have allowed the rebate program based on paymentsthat could be linked with specific Sony sales. However, we have deniedthe rebate program based on distributor resales. This program ended onSeptember 20, 1987, and was therefore only in effect for approximatelythree weeks during the period of investigation. Thus, distributor resalesthat took place during this three-week period were likely based on salesof the subject merchandise from Sony to its distributors prior to the periodof investigation.<T3>Comment 6</T3>: With respect to direct customer price protection, Sonycredits customers with a rebate which is based on the customer's inventoryas of a certain date. The amount of the credit is determined by reductionsin Sony's price made after the customer purchases the product at a higherprice and places the product in inventory. Petitioner argues that thisrebate cannot be allowed as an adjustment to the price of home market salesduring the period of investigation if the payment by Sony is based on salesmade prior to the period of investigation.Sony states that it took the most conservative approach and reported priceprotection paid during the period of investigation as opposed to expensesaccrued during the period. However, Sony claims that this should be changedsince the verifier apparently perferred using expenses accrued during theperiod of investigation.<T3>DOC Position</T3>: We agree with Sony and have used the verified accruedexpenses in our calculation, because the accrued expenses are those thatare directly related to sales made during the period of investigation.<T3>Comment 7</T3>: Petitioner believes that ocean freight expenses areconsiderably understated. Petitioner urges the Department to review Sony'scubic foot per microdisk figure as it claims it differs substantially fromVerbatim's actual experience.Sony claims that this expense was thoroughly verified.<T3>DOC Position</T3>: We have verified Sony's ocean freight expenses andhave used these figures in our calculation.<T3>Comment 8</T3>: Petitioner asserts that the Department should not limitthe calculation of Market Development Funds (MDFs) in the U.S. market onlyto payments made, but should also consider commitments of MDF made to customers.Petitioner believes that these amounts should be included in the adjustmentto U.S. price.Sony argues that calculating this expense on payments plus commitmentswould constitute double counting. SONAM's revised figures are based onpayments from 9/1/87-8/31/88 and are divided by sales made during the sameperiod.<T3>DOC Position</T3>: We verified Sony's MDF payments made to customersduring the period of investigation and have used these figures in our calculation.<T3>Fuji Comments</T3><T3>Comment 1</T3>: Petitioner argues that Fuji incorrectly reported theshipping dates on purchase price sales as the date the product clearedJapanese Customs, rather than the date the product was shipped from theChofu plant. The proper shipping date should be used and the time betweenshipment from Chofu and the clearance of the product through Japanese Customsshould be added to the credit period of U.S. purchase price sales.Fuji argues that the microdisks are sent from its Chofu plant to its Yokohamafacilities for assembly or export packing and are considered its inventoryassets. Only at the time the merchandise is shipped to its purchase pricecustomers from its Yokohama facility does Fuji commence credit expensesas a measure of its financing of accounts receivables. Fuji states thatit has corrected the date of shipment to the time the merchandise is shippedfrom its Yokohama factory rather than the time the merchandise clearedJapanese Customs.<T3>DOC Position</T3>: We agree with the respondents that credit expensesare incurred from the time the merchandise is shipped to its purchase pricecustomers from its Yokohama facility and not from the time it leaves theChofu plant, since part of the finishing process, <T3>i.e., </T3>assembly and packing, is done at Yolohama.<T3>Comment 2</T3>: Petitioner asserts that Fuji's reported payment dateson home market sales were often not the actual payment dates. Petitionerargues that the actual payment dates should be used, and appropriate adjustmentsfrom payment terms and credit expense should be made.Fuji states that most dates of payment were correct, some were not. Someshowed longer dates of payment, some shorter. Others indicated partialpayment on many different dates. Fuji claims that, at verification, itprovided data on the actual credit expenses incurred on sales in the homemarket.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The corrected information on credit expense wasverified, and we have used this information in our calculation.Hitachi Comments<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner states that with respect to Hitachi, theDepartment created separate subgroupings of microdisk sales in the homeand U.S. markets based solely on the presence or absence of a printed shutteror label.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department disagrees. Hitachi's methodologyfor matching its home market products with its identical U.S. productswas correct. Comparisons were made based not only on the presence or absenceof a printed shutter or label but were based on the major relevant characteristicsof 3.5andmin16;andmin16; microdisks. Furthermore, product comparisons for homemarket and U.S. products conducted at verification verified as identical.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Petitioner states that, for Hitachi's purchase pricesales, actual payment dates must be substituted for reported payment dates.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. Hitachi's purchase price sales wereestimated as net 61 days from shipment date. At verification, the Departmentverified that 61 days was a reasonable estimate as some dates of paymentwere substantially less than 61 days while other dates of payment weremore than 61 days. Furthermore, we verified that it was not possible tocorrelate particular payments with particular sales as Hitachi's paymentsfrom its customers were made on the outstanding balances rather than oneach individual sale.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>Petitioner states because Hitachi has requested thatthe Department disregard certain related sales in the home market, allrelevant home market sales data have not been provided and should be providedso that a proper review and comment can be made.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. In its May 27, 1988, response, Hitachiinitially reported a supplemental list of home market sales to unrelatedpurchasers made by its two selling subsidiaries in Japan. These supplementalsales have been used in our calculations.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Petitioner states that the verification of Hitachi'stime in inventory of product shipped from the Tsukuba factory to Hitachinoted an understatement. Petitioner claims this understatement should becorrected and inventory carrying costs should be recalculated.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>DOD disagrees. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.23(a), theunderstatement of inventory carrying costs has been determined to be insignificantin relation to the price or value of the affected transaction and may bedisregarded.<ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of 3.4andmin16;andmin16; microdisks and coated media thereoffrom Japan that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,on or after September 29, 1988, the date of publication of the preliminarydetermination in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.
