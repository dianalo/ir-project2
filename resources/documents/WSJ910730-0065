Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattandistrict attorney, said in an interview that yesterday'sindictment spanned only about one-quarter of the possiblecase involving the rogue bank. And the Fed hinted yesterdaythat &quot;additional enforcement actions&quot; are under study.</LP><TEXT>   The 12-count New York indictment charges thatscandal-plagued BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A., along withfour affiliated companies and its two Pakistani founders,drew in $20 billion of deposits from around the globe througha variety of frauds, including the payment of $3 million inbribes to top central bank officials in Peru.   Three counts of grand larceny in the indictment involvethe supposed theft of $30 million from accounts involving anAmerican Express Co. unit, while eight counts involvesuspected money-laundering. Mr. Morgenthau estimated that&quot;upwards of $5 billion has been lost&quot; through the allegedfraud at BCCI, which the Bank of England and other regulatorsseized on July 5.   In Washington, the Fed issued a 100-page order inconnection with the fine for alleged violations of U.S.banking laws. The order catalogues the dozens ofsurreptitious steps by which BCCI allegedly acquired a hiddeninterest in First American Bankshares Inc., Washington'sbiggest bank holding company.   The order contains the previously unreported finding thatBCCI controls about 60% of First American's holding company.First American, in turn, became the stepping stone in aneffort to more broadly infiltrate U.S. banking, the Fed ordersuggests.   Clark Clifford, a veteran Democratic presidential adviserand former defense secretary who serves as First American'schairman, and his law partner Robert Altman, the president ofFirst American, were not named in the New York indictment. Ata news conference yesterday, Mr. Morgenthau said the grandjury was still investigating whether Messrs. Clifford andAltman misled regulators about BCCI's ownership of FirstAmerican.   The two executives were listed in the Fed order amongthose who had a role in enabling BCCI's secret takeover ofthe bank holding company.   Messrs. Clifford and Altman maintain that, just as U.S.bank regulators were fooled by BCCI's covert ownership ofFirst American and other U.S. financial institutions, so toowere they. Both men &quot;continue to maintain they have alwaysacted honestly and in the best interests of First American,&quot;their lawyer, Robert Bennett, said yesterday. &quot;No depositorhas ever lost a penny,&quot; Mr. Bennett added. &quot;BCCI has nevercontrolled the management or decision-making at FirstAmerican.&quot;   In addition to the five BCCI companies cited in the NewYork complaint, the grand jury indicted Agha Hasan Abedi ofPakistan, who founded BCCI in 1972, and his protege SwalehNaqvi, the former chief executive officer of the bank. Thetwo built BCCI into an institution spanning theindustrialized world and the Third World -- but one thatinvestigators allege was the bank of choice formoney-launderers, arms dealers, terrorists and othernefarious characters.   In Karachi, Pakistan, Mr. Abedi yesterday told theAssociated Press that he would be exonerated. &quot;The truth willultimately prevail,&quot; he said. &quot;I have full faith in God. He'salways guided me.&quot; Mr. Naqvi, who lives in Abu Dhabi,couldn't be reached.   The indictment and the Fed order also name severalprominent Middle Eastern money men -- including, in the caseof the Fed order, leaders from the United Arab Emirates. Thegrand jury and the Fed said that through separate means,these wealthy individuals let BCCI use their names variouslyto inflate its financial standing or to hide its activities.   The grand jury named as co-conspirators, but did notindict, Ghaith R. Pharaon, a Saudi investor who often actedas BCCI's front man in investments in the U.S.; Sheik KamalAdham, a former Saudi intelligence chief and a brother-in-lawof the late King Faisal; Sayed Jawhary, an adviser to SheikAdham; and Faisal Saud al-Fulaij, a Kuwaiti businessman. Itsaid the four allowed BCCI to &quot;trade on their reputations forwealth&quot; by fraudulently using their names as shareholders.   The Fed order seeks to permanently bar from U.S. bankingthose four individuals plus A.R. Khalil, a Saudi businessman,and Khusro Elley, a BCCI official who became senior vicepresident of First American Bank of New York. None of theindividuals named in either document could immediately bereached for comment.   Contrary to the assertions by Messrs. Altman and Clifford,the Fed order asserted that BCCI did play a role in FirstAmerican's management, particularly in the selection of topofficers at its New York affiliate. The order also detailsmeetings at which BCCI officials seemingly plotted a hugecovert infiltration of the U.S. banking industry, to whichBCCI had been denied access by regulators.   &quot;Our major task in the U.S. should be to build marketshare&quot; for BCCI, one official of the bank stated at a 1985meeting in New York, according to records obtained by theFed. Added another participant in the meeting: &quot;In America weare sitting on $7 billion {in} assets, and this is just thebeginning.&quot;   The Fed also charged that BCCI used secret arrangements,acting through Mr. Pharaon and other nominees, to illegallyacquire ownership or control of National Bank of Georgia andCenTrust Savings Bank, Miami. It later arranged the sale ofNational Bank of Georgia to First American's holding company,all the while concealing its ownership from regulators, theFed said.   Whether the Fed can collect its $200 million fine fromBCCI remains to be seen -- but the authorities may have a fewpromising avenues. For one, the Fed has ordered BCCI todivest its 60% interest in First American, and could demandpayment from the proceeds as a condition of approving thesale.   In the New York case, the first and most comprehensivecriminal count that was listed -- grand larceny in the firstdegree -- would expose Messrs. Naqvi and Abedi to prisonterms of as much as 25 years. Mr. Morgenthau said at thepress conference that his office would seek the extraditionof both men, but he declined to comment on whether it islikely that they will be turned over to the U.S.   The three additional counts of grand larceny concernlosses suffered by the American Express unit when BCCI wasseized by regulators. BCCI obtained those deposits &quot;throughfraudulent means, by falsely representing BCCI's financialcondition,&quot; and &quot;the losses are thefts,&quot; Mr. Morgenthau saidin a statement.   A spokesman for American Express Bank Ltd. confirmedhaving the accounts with BCCI but said that the unit hadn'tlost any money. Under agreements with BCCI, the spokesmansaid, American Express had the right to offset its exposureagainst BCCI deposits at American Express. &quot;We're cooperatingfully,&quot; the spokesman added.   The additional eight counts in the New York indictmentinvolve the falsification of business records as a result ofBCCI's alleged failure to file currency transaction reportson deposits of more than $10,000, as required by federal law.The Manhattan district attorney said these transactions&quot;appear to be instances of money-laundering.&quot;   The indictment cites only one case of an alleged bribe --about $3 million, it said, paid in 1986 and 1987 to thePanamanian branch of a Swiss bank to &quot;the two seniorofficers&quot; of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru in exchange forcentral bank deposits from Peru.   The indictment didn't identify the supposed recipients,but at the time the two senior central bank posts were heldby Leonel Figueroa, a close associate of former Peruvianpresident Alan Garcia, and Mr. Figueroa's assistant, HectorNeyra. Mr. Figueroa was in Chile yesterday and didn't returna phone message; Mr. Neyra has been unreachable for sometime.   All told, Mr. Morgenthau said, BCCI constituted &quot;one ofthe most complex and secretive criminal organizations that wehave ever encountered.&quot; He added: &quot;BCCI was operated as acorrupt criminal organization throughout its entire 19-yearhistory.&quot;   The apparent scope of the fraud, as well as its duration,renewed attention on the U.S. Justice Department, whichprosecuted BCCI for money-laundering in the late 1980s butwhich never went beyond the relatively narrow issues in thatcase. The department has also received extensive informationfrom other authorities over the years.   &quot;At a minimum, the department took this information andlooked the other way,&quot; Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) saidin a statement. Officials of the agency have defended theirhandling of the case, citing, among other things, thecomplexity of the controversies surrounding the bank.   Meanwhile, a statement by First American Bankshares' chiefexecutive, Jack Beddow, said that the actions of the Fed andthe Manhattan district attorney &quot;have no impact on FirstAmerican or its customers.&quot; He said First American has &quot;astrong capital base&quot; and is insured by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. He added that the bank &quot;continues tocooperate with government authorities in this matter.&quot;   ---   Wade Lambert in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
