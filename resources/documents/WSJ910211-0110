Even though &quot;the climate for doing business in Poland isdifficult,&quot; the Polish-American Enterprise Fund already hascommitted more than $50 million for new joint ventures, saysRobert Faris, the fund's chief executive officer. The fund,established by Congress in 1989, plans to provide $240million in investments and loans.</LP><TEXT>   This month, the fund plans to announce a $2.3 millionjoint venture investment with Metl-Span Corp., Lewisville,Texas, and a Polish state concern to manufacture panels forcold storage facilities in Poland. The newly formed venturealso will design and construct the facilities.   Last October, the fund announced its first investment, a$6 million joint venture with Chicago's South Shore Bank andPoznan's Market Bank to provide small businesses with loansthat range from $20,000 to $300,000. Mr. Faris says thepartnership between Market and South Shore should act as amodel for other joint bank ventures as well. Otherinvestments by the fund include a joint venture developmentcompany for residential housing, a cooperative that willmarket apples, and a privately owned furniture maker.   The $60 million Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund alsohas taken off, according to Alex Tomlinson, the fund's chiefexecutive officer. The fund, which plans a combination ofinvestments and loans to small businesses, has committed toseven deals and has another eight in the pipeline. Theinvestments, mostly in joint ventures with small U.S.companies, include a broad spectrum of businesses rangingfrom software designers and computer retailing franchises toprinters and distributors of chemicals.   &quot;There's active interest in both the U.S. and Europe indoing business in Hungary,&quot; he explains. Moreover, &quot;thegovernment has created attractive tax incentives for foreigninvestors.&quot;   ---   NEW INVESTMENT BOUTIQUES provide added financing optionsfor small firms.   Even as big Wall Street firms cut back on business, smallinvestment banks are focusing on the needs of small companiesin narrow business niches. Punk, Ziegel andamp; Knoell, a New Yorkstart-up, is concentrating on companies in software,communications and health care. HKS andamp; Co., Warren, N.J., andBrenner Securities, New York, specialize in pharmaceuticaland health-care businesses.   The large Wall Street firms are &quot;consolidating andrationalizing their businesses,&quot; says Fred Ziegel, aco-founder of Punk, Ziegel andamp; Knoell. &quot;The big firms aren'taggressive in going after small and middle-sized companies.&quot;   Catering to the financing needs of small businesses, whichusually generate small fees, &quot;makes great economic sense forus,&quot; says Hemant Shah of HKS, adding, &quot;If I get a $100,000fee, that's a lot of money, given our size. That kind ofmoney won't even cover overhead at a bigger firm.&quot; Two recentfinancings arranged by Mr. Shah were turned down by biggerWall Street firms.   Sequoia Advisors Inc., Mount Vernon, N.Y., says it isconcentrating its efforts on restructuring capital forcompanies that are too small for others.   &quot;With banks pulling credit lines, or threatening to, andbusiness generally slow, a lot of small firms need toreorganize their financing,&quot; says Peter Hurst, one ofSequoia's principals.   ---   SOME PROFESSIONAL investors plan exchange to trade sharesin small firms.   Even though the National Association of Securities DealersAutomated Quotations system already caters to many smallcompanies, companies with annual sales of $20 million or lessusually fall between the cracks, contends Ralph McNeal, aventure capitalist who managed General Foods Corp.'s NorthStreet Capital investment subsidiary. He and a group ofprofessional investors plan a new exchange that will targetthese neglected companies with sales between $1 million and$20 million.   The investors soon plan to seek Securities and ExchangeCommission approval for the exchange, to be called theAmerican Small Business Stock Exchange. It will involve up to100 seats nationwide in both floor and electronic trading.There currently are applicants for more than 50 seats, Mr.McNeal says.   &quot;We are focusing on companies that are not in a positionto be listed on existing exchanges,&quot; says Clifford Gates,president of the exchange. About 40,000 firms whose sharesare quoted in the so-called pink sheets are potentialcandidates, he adds.   The investors say they plan to avoid the speculativeexcesses that hurt similar stock exchanges in Denver andVancouver by listing only operating companies. Moreover, theexchange would monitor its market-makers and trades moreclosely, they say.   ---   MORE INVESTORS place funds in &quot;socially responsible&quot;businesses.   Many of these businesses are attractive not only becausethey have a social agenda but also because they are goodbusinesses, says Artemis Joukowsky, a partner with AlterraFinancial Management Inc., Cambridge, Mass. Alterra hasinvested a total of $10 million in 10 companies, all with anenvironmental focus.   One of Alterra's investments is Aquafuture Inc., aMontague, Mass., aquaculture company. It created a system forgrowing fish that also cleans water in the process.Aquafuture's sales grew almost tenfold last year, Mr.Joukowsky notes.   While some investors are traditional mainstream concerns,others have a social purpose, too. Shaman PharmaceuticalInc., a San Carlos, Calif., biopharmaceutical firm, last weekraised $1.7 million from Calvert Social Venture Fund andthree mainstream investment funds.   Shaman is developing drugs for respiratory viralinfections using plants grown in South America. Theharvesting and selling of the plants will establish new smallbusinesses in these South American countries, says LisaConte, president of Shaman.</TEXT></DOC>
