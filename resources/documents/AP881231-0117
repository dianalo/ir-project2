Takeshita also said he wanted to expand relations with the SovietUnion and other Asian countries and hoped Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev will visit Japan in 1989.   Two of the ministers resigned in a major stock scandal that hasroiled Japan and prompted the resignations of more than a dozengovernment and business leaders.   ``I am solely to blame for four ministers resigning,'' Takeshitasaid in a New Year's news conference held Friday but embargoed untilSunday. ``Somehow we have to regain the public's trust.''   He did not make specific proposals.   Takeshita has apologized indirectly for the scandal before,saying every politican must conduct himself ethically. However, thiswas the first time he has laid the blame solely and explicitly onhimself.   Takeshita's Cabinet has taken a beating in recent weeks despitethe prime minister's success last month in pushing sweeping taxreform legislation through Parliament.   Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa resigned Friday _ only threedays after he was appointed in a Cabinet shakeup _ after it wasrevealed he received political donations from a company embroiled inthe stock-trading scandal he was appointed to investigate.   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa stepped down early Decemberafter repeatedly changing his explanation of a close aide's purchaseof unlisted shares of the company's real estate subsidiary atbargain prices.   The director of the National Land Agency stepped down in Mayafter he created a controversy by claiming Japan was not responsiblefor World War II, and the chief of the Defense Agency resigned totake responsibility for a navy submarine's collision with a fishingboat in July which left 30 people dead.   In foreign affairs, Takeshita pledged to keep U.S.-Japaneserelations at the center of his foreign policy, but he said he wouldextend Japan's diplomacy toward the Soviet Union, Asia and thePacific region.   Tokyo and Moscow never signed a peace treaty officially endinghostilities after World War II largely due to a territorial disputeover a group of Soviet-held islands off northern Japan.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited Japan lastmonth. The two sides did not reach agreement on the occupiedterritories but vowed to discuss the matter further.   Takeshita said at the news conference that he hoped SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev will come to Tokyo this year for thefirst visit to Japan by a top Soviet leader.   He also said he was looking forward to an early meeting withPresident-elect Bush in Washington but he gave no date.   Earlier plans for Takeshita to visit Washington in January werecanceled, ostensibly because of domestic political scheduling.However, the stock trading scandal and 87-year-old EmperorHirohito's prolonged illness may have been additional factors.   At his news conference, Takeshita did not mention the emperor,who has been bedridden since Sept. 19 with internal hemorrhaging.</TEXT></DOC>
