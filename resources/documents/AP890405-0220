The scale of the problem hasnot yet been identified by law enforcement.''   The thieves are primarily Colombian nationals based in LosAngeles and New York, who steal diamonds, precious gems, rarecoins, travelers checks and expensive clothes, authorities say.Ring members live under a strict code of silence and willingly jumpbail, officials say.   ``It's impossible to surveille these guys,'' said San Franciscopolice Detective Ray Kilroy. ``They're real pros. They know exactlywhat they're doing.''   This year, the ring for the first time will be included in theCalifornia Department of Justice annual report to the Legislatureon organized crime.   ``We're getting Teletypes from throughout the nation,'' aboutthe ring's thefts, said Ken Bowen, supervisor of the department'sorganized crime and criminal intelligence bureau.   Although the FBI in 1985 set up a central clearinghouse _code-named Colgem for ``Colombian Gem'' _ to gather photographs,fingerprints and rap sheets on ring members, the bureau has notmade a concerted push to go after the ring, said Robin Wright,section chief in the FBI's criminal investigative division.   In addition to Los Angeles, the Chicago, New York and Miamipolice departments have at times operated gem ring task forces. TheLos Angeles task force, created a year ago at a meeting of 16federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, was to havedisbanded in December, but is still operating.   Police estimate Los Angeles has 300 to 1,000 ring members andthat 700 to 1,200 live in New York's borough of Queens.   Gem dealers wonder when the situation will change, said Jack B.White, president of the Jeweler's Security Alliance and a formerFBI agent. The thieves ``are smart. They are successful without agun, without weapons. They have tactics that work.''</TEXT></DOC>
