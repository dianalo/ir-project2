Also dying were late attempts in the House to raise more cash for the thrift industry's insolvent insurance fund, restrict its operations, and close down its quasi-private agency that handles bad assets of failed thrifts.    A failure to legislate on the bankpowers issue this year is expected to give the Federal Reserve Board the green light to continue expanding banks' securities powers into corporate debt, and ultimately, corporate equities.    In recent weeks, chances for a broad bank-powers bill have faded as special-interest crossfire stymied the Senate and jurisdictional battles tied up the House. Lobbyists and congressional staffers yesterday said the bill's chances were all but gone.    On Tuesday night, Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) lost his best shot at a last-ditch attempt. Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) first agreed to let Sen. Proxmire take his bill to the floor, then reneged in the face of threatened delays from Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), the securities industry's chief defender in the Senate.    The Senate now is expected to move on to an anti-drug bill. That could keep the banking bill off the floor until tomorrow or later, said Kenneth McLean, staff chief for the Senate Banking Committee. With adjournment imminent, &quot;that's too late,&quot; Mr. McLean said.    Across the Capitol, Democrats from the House Banking Committee are locked in a dispute with their counterparts from the House Energy and Commerce Committee regarding who has jurisdiction over the legislation. Several rounds of meetings have failed to resolve the deadlock, and Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) has refused to mediate.    On substance, the House's commerce panel has taken a far different tack from its banking panel or the Senate. Unlike them, it would continue to prohibit banks from underwriting corporate debt or mutual funds. Instead, it would offer banks a narrow range of new powers that big banks already have obtained from regulators, but with strong restrictions.    At this point, few of the affected industry groups want a bill. Most banks turned against the legislation last August, after the House Banking Committee loaded it with consumer-service requirements. The securities industry likes the commerce panel's bill, but it has little hope that that version would survive a House-Senate conference and it is uniting against legislation. Only the insurance lobbyists are holding out hope of getting what they want: curbs on banks' sale of insurance.    (As previously reported, Chase Manhattan Corp. said this week it will seek Federal Reserve Board clearance to underwrite mutual funds and corporate debt securities if the current Congress doesn't grant such powers to commercial banks.)    With legislative time running out to draft a well-thought-out compromise, lobbyists are turning more negative. &quot;Nobody wants to gamble&quot; on a last-minute deal in which lawmakers &quot;throw all the pieces up toward the ceiling and {enact} whichever hits the floor first,&quot; said one lobbyist.    Increasingly, banking and securities-firm lobbyists say they expect Congress to tackle the bank-powers issue again next year in an omnibus bill to also resolve the problem of insolvent thrifts and revise deposit insurance.    A late effort to put more cash into the thrifts' Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. ran aground in the House Rules Committee, which refused to schedule it for floor consideration. The measure would have allowed the FSLIC's parent, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to issue $15.8 billion in bonds at will. Currently, its bond authority is limited to $10.8 billion, with no more than $3.75 billion issued per year.    The thrift industry, whose fees would have to pay off the added bonds, lobbied hard to kill the bill. The Bank Board and the Reagan administration also opposed the bill because it would have imposed restrictions on the FSLIC, such as barring assistance to acquirers of insolvent thrifts unless they contributed capital of at least 1% of assets.    The House also failed to clear a measure mandating the dissolution of a quasiprivate Bank Board unit designed to manage and unload bad assets of many failed thrifts. The House voted 247-130 in favor of the measure, falling short of the two-thirds vote needed on this legislation.    The Federal Asset Disposition Association has been criticized for allegedly tolerating conflicts of interest, paying high salaries and failing to perform effectively. But the FADA has been defended by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and many Republicans. </TEXT></DOC>
