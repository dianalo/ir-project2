CLEMENS, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis is running for president on brains, big bucks and baklava. He'd like to add blue-collar voters.    Michigan's Democratic caucuses tomorrow give him a chance, but the Massachusetts governor must first overcome challenges by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt. Mr. Jackson, who could win the popular vote, draws huge crowds and taps the emotional loyalty of the state's black voters. Here in the white, working-class towns of Macomb County, Mr. Gephardt shows strength with a last-ditch appeal to auto and steel workers hurt by foreign imports.    It is a fight of importance beyond Michigan. Gov. Dukakis's well-financed campaign has kept him in the lead among Democrats, but outside his native New England he has had trouble reaching working-class voters. He is dogged by the same self-contained, suburban image that has marked him throughout his career. Now as the potential nominee, he needs more than ever to touch and motivate this blue-collar constituency so critical to Democrats in the fall.    &quot;He passed the regional test by winning Florida and Texas,&quot; says Democratic strategist Kirk O'Donnell. &quot;Now he has to pass the income test by winning blue-collar voters.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis has downplayed his liberal image and toughened his tone on trade. After months of saying new legislation isn't needed, he shifted this week and made a show of embracing a Senate-passed amendment to expedite the U.S. response to unfair practices by foreign nations.    &quot;He moved more in line with the mainstream Democratic congressional position on trade,&quot; says Michigan Rep. Bob Traxler. Just as quickly, Michigan Sen. Donald Riegle, one of the provision's sponsors, endorsed the governor in a bit of political intrigue that provoked Mr. Gephardt to accuse his rival of undergoing a &quot;battlefield conversion.&quot;    Moving blue-collar voters into the Dukakis camp requires more, but Michigan offers him an attractive opportunity. This is a state where unions advertise their prowess from billboards, and the children of immigrants respond to the ethnic appeal of a Greek-American running for president.    Where he lacks passion, Mr. Dukakis finds proxies. The booming voice of Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy introduces him in union halls. The white-haired, Irish face of former House Speaker Thomas O'Neill is his champion in a televised pitch to retirees on Social Security.    Polls show the governor doing well, but in the past week he has devoted less time to the state than his two chief rivals. While Mr. Gephardt plods from one factory gate to the next, Mr. Dukakis has seen little of the workers he is courting. He returns to Michigan today, but since two union rallies with Sen. Kennedy last Friday in Flint and Bay City, he has appeared almost entirely at campuses and community centers.    The distance between those audiences underscores his potential vulnerability. A short, slightly built man, Mr. Dukakis began as an outsider in the tribal politics of Massachusetts, and remains more suburban Brookline than urban Boston.    &quot;Brookline finds him or he finds Brookline in every state he goes into,&quot; says Prof. Ralph Whitehead of the University of Massachusetts. Beginning in Iowa, television exit polls tend to bear this out.    Except in Texas, where he ran well among Hispanics, Mr. Dukakis often drew far more support from professionals and managers than from blue-collar voters on Super Tuesday. While winning Maryland, he got 26% of the blue-collar vote, according to NBC News surveys, compared with 44% of the professionals. In North Carolina, he won 16% of the blue-collar vote compared with 28% among professionals.    Winning the support of more blue-collar Democrats has a high priority in the Dukakis campaign. One reason that Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden was an early target of the Dukakis forces was evidence that he was beginning to draw blue-collar voters.    If Mr. Gephardt can be eliminated in Michigan -- the congressman must decide by Tuesday whether to file to run for his House seat -- it would greatly strengthen the governor's hand. Besides the Rev. Jackson, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore would be the only major rival left, and he has yet to show he can appeal to Northern working-class voters with the same success he enjoyed in the South.    This is an issue Gov. Dukakis has confronted before. His bitter defeat in 1978 owed much to his loss of working-class Democrats. In his comeback four years later, Mr. Dukakis rode a wave of support not only in the suburbs, but in the cities he lost previously to Edward King. Massachusetts election records show Mr. King actually increased his vote in Boston, Worcester and Fall River almost 13%, but the Dukakis vote rose 64%.    In the years since, Mr. Dukakis has built strong ties to labor. These are crucial now in blunting Mr. Gephardt's ability to mobilize the United Auto Workers union.    Despite Rep. Gephardt's strong support for the union's trade platform, the UAW hasn't officially endorsed any candidate, and its leadership is dispersed among the different camps in a struggle sometimes reflecting the union's internal politics.    President Owen Bieber is personally a Gephardt partisan, even as his predecessor Douglas Fraser is featured in new television ads for Mr. Dukakis this week. Donald Ephlin, a UAW vice president and potential Bieber rival, is known to favor Mr. Dukakis. The governor has cast himself as a more viable alternative to Mr. Gephardt on the trade message.    The Rev. Jackson is a force himself within the UAW ranks. The black preacher drew hundreds of workers to a rally this week in Dearborn and is expected to easily ride over whatever support Detroit Mayor Coleman Young generates in the black community for Mr. Dukakis. Mr. Jackson has limited appeal to white voters in counties like Macomb, but whatever the outcome, his populist message has touched a chord among blue-collar workers of both races that Mr. Dukakis has yet to find.    The governor's strongest bond lies in his own ethnicity. Even as he ran behind on blue-collar voters in the South, he captured much of the Catholic vote.    Carl Marlinga, the Macomb county prosecutor, backs Mr. Gephardt, but from remarks in his own Polish-American family, he knows the calm demeanor and Greek heritage of Mr. Dukakis are important assets. &quot;It's a way of expressing a coming of age of your own ethnic group,&quot; he says, &quot;to say this Greek-American is going to make it.&quot;    These ties are sure to be invoked when the campaign ends tonight with a rally in the small Polish-American city of Hamtramck. But missing from the story of Mr. Dukakis's family is any sense of the failure so many immigrants have encountered. Before students in Ann Arbor this week, Mr. Dukakis spoke proudly of his parents' achievements soon after coming to this country, and the son gives the impression of someone who has rarely lost.    His very sureness and control seem to make it harder for him to convey an understanding of the insecurity felt by many workers.    When Mr. Dukakis was heading for college in the 1950s, George Watts was starting at the then-promising McLouth steel mill south of Detroit. Today the mill is threatened and neither of Mr. Watts's sons can find work there. &quot;I wish he had a little bit more care for the people,&quot; Mr. Watts says of the governor.    Michigan's Democratic caucuses amount to an abbreviated primary in which votes are cast for each candidate and then delegates awarded in May. A total of 138 are at stake, 90 of which will be distributed according to the vote in individual congressional districts. Thus the Rev. Jackson could generate enough support to win the popular vote but end up behind -- as he did in Illinois -- in captured delegates.    Mr. Dukakis's switch on trade coincides with a harder line on crime. Surrounded by a display of confiscated weapons Wednesday, he vowed a war on drugs with Michigan law-enforcement officers. At home this week, he announced he wouldn't veto a bill restricting furloughs for Massachusetts prison inmates.    The core of his message remains jobs and hope, but those who listen seem more drawn by the winning image than by the man himself. &quot;Our hearts are more with a Gephardt or Jackson,&quot; says Max Grider, 36 years old, an unemployed auto worker at Buick's Flint plant.    David Pichey is a bit older, 42, and has enough seniority to keep his job. &quot;Right now I have to vote for him,&quot; he says of Mr. Dukakis. &quot;My feeling is I have to put a Democrat in there and he can win.&quot;    ---                Dukakis's Blue-Collar Support   Here is how Michael Dukakis fared with blue-collar votersand voters in professional and managerial jobs in some of this year's primary elections, according to NBC News exit polls:                                              Percentage of                          Percentage of       Professional                          Blue-Collar         And Managerial                          Voters              Voters    Maryland                   26%                 44%    North Carolina             16                  28    Virginia                   20                  30    Missouri                    9                  18    Massachusetts              54                  57</TEXT></DOC>
