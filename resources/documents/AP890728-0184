Dmitri Yazov, addressing London's Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs, said a proposal to replace the Lance with alonger-range version violated the 1987 Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty.   He was winding up a four-day official visit, the first by aSoviet defense minister to a NATO country since World War II.   ``Why should we continue liquidating our Okas if NATO will notrenounce the modernization of Lance?'' said Yazov, referring to themissile by a Soviet name.   Under the treaty, all Soviet and U.S. land-based missile withranges of between 300 and 3,000 miles must be eliminated by 1991.   Yazov said later that if ``the Americans begin to build Lanceswith a range up to 500 kilometers (300 miles), we will be forced toagain make this Oka.''   He said the Soviet Union believed the United States ``does nothave the right to build such a missile.''   In Washington, a Bush administration official said SS-23s areclearly covered by the INF treaty and that Lance missiles are not.``It would be absurd for the Soviets to suggest that while we're incompliance with the accord, they would have reason to violate it,''the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   NATO, at a summit meeting in May, deferred a decision onmodernizing the Lance missiles. A proposal calls for tripling therange of the current missiles, to just under 300 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
