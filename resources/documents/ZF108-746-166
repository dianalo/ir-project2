Grochow, avice president of American Management Systems, Inc. (AMS), Arlington, Va.,andO;has queried over 2,500 people at up to 500 organizations over the last threeyears.andP;  He found that few IT organizations are quantitatively measuringproductivity or quality.andM;Said Grochow, &quot;As an industry, we have a dismal performance in this area.andO;There is no other industry that knows so little about itself in a qualitativeway.&quot;andM;The organizations measuring, or just getting into measurement, are primarilydoing it for the same reasons.andP;  Software is becoming more complex and userdemands and expectations are increasing.andP;  The need to develop bettersoftware, faster, translates to a need to quantify the project's progress andthe system's attributes.andM;A variety of productivity/quality metrics are available; choosing the mostappropriate one can be as tricky is picking winning lottery numbers.andP;  (SeeFigure 1.)andM;Measuring does have its detractors.andP;  Many &quot;artists&quot; still refuse to bemeasured.andP;  Ironically, measuring often produces the unusual effect ofincreasing productivity in just the areas that are measured.andM;In most situations, the term &quot;metrics&quot; is used in conjunction with theprogramming process only.andP;  But programming is the smallest part of thesystems development life cycle.andP;  For an effective measurement program, eachcomponent of the life cycle must include its own measures -- or a measuremust be used that encompasses the entire spectrum of development.andM;The software development process is one of the most complex processes a humancan perform, according to T. Capers Jones, chairman of Software ProductivityResearch (SPR) in Burlington, Mass.andP;  Software development includes numerousformidable tasks.andP;  Although variations abound in the number of executablesteps in a life cycle, most IT organizations perform the same functionality.andM;Metrics must consider several esoteric items, such as user involvement, whichis positively correlated with productivity increases.andP;  Human factors mustalso be taken into account, such as the square footage allocated perprogrammer.andP;  (Jones' research has shown that a full 78 square feet of floorspace increases programmer productivity more than any Case tool.)andP;  Design,programming and quality factors must also be weighed.andM;Quality measurements are frequently overlooked in the race to implement on orbefore deadline.andP;  However, no matter what the time pressure, certain measuresundertaken seriously can enhance the quality of output of any softwareinvestment.andP;  (See Figure 2.)andM;Measurement of quality is often thought of as a manufacturing process.andP;  Butthis is changing, and the hardware manufacturers are leading the way.andO;Geoffrey Roach, a marketing executive in the Marlboro, Mass., office ofdigital Equipment Corporation (DEC), described the automated methodology usedto run the 22,000 quality checks on the VAX Cobol compiler.andM;With 22,000 tests, it is impossible to test the compiler thoroughly, so DECwrote VaxScan, which looks at many micro-oriented measures such as rate ofchange and how much the program was tested.andP;  It also measures theintroduction of new errors, plus performs many other tests.andM;Roach tells the story of W.E.andP;  Deming, who fought unsuccessfully for qualitymeasurements within the automabile industry.andP;  Deming took his message to theJapanese, who listened.andP;  The rest is history.andM;Deming's message is being taken seriously by the likes of Roach and others onthe hardware side.andP;  That message is slowly getting through to mainstreamcorporation data centers.andM;THE ORIGINAL METRICandM;Those who measure most often use a simple source-lines-of-code (SLOC) metric.andO;With this metric, however, there is room for variation.andP;  In their 1986 bok,Software Engineering Metrics and Models, published by the Benjamin/CummingsPublishing Company, the authors Conte, Dunsmore and Shen proposed thisdefinition of SLOC:andM;&quot;A line of code is any line of program text that is not a comment or blankline, regardless of the number of statements or fragments of statements onthat line.andP;  This specifically includes all lines containing program headers,declarations and executable and nonexecutable statements.&quot;andM;The SLOC metric is often further redefined into distinguishing the number ofnoncomment source lines of code (NCSLOC) from the lines of code containingcomment statements (CSLOC).andM;Along with SLOC measurements, the weekly time sheet provides other grossstatistics often used for productivity measurements.andP;  The total number oflabor hours expended, divided by the total number of NCSLOC, provides anoverall statistic that can be used to compared productivity from project toproject.andM;One problem with this SLOC measurement is that it does not take into accountthe complexity of the code being developed or maintained.andP;  &quot;Lines of code andman-months hide some very important things,&quot; said AMS' Grochow.andP;  For example,the SLOC measurement for a name and address file update program might be 600lines of code per day.andM;On the other hand, the output for software that tracked satellites might bein the range of 40 to 50 lines of code per day.andP;  To look at this output on apurely gross statistical level, one would conclude that the name and addressproject was more productive and efficient than the satellite project.andP;  Thisconclusion would be wrong.andM;So starting from this base, two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology's Center for Information Systems Research in Cambridge, Mass.,andO;examined this complexity issue.andP;  Chris F. Kemerer and Geoffrey K. Gillstudied the software development projects undertaken by an aerospace defensecontracting firm from 1984 to 1989.andM;The Kemerer and Gill team began their research by reviewing the originalmeasure for complexity as developed by Thomas Mccabe, now president of McCabeandamp; Associates, a Columbia, Md., consulting group, in his article, &quot;AComplexity Measure&quot; [IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 1976].andO;McCabe proposed that a valid measurement of complexity would be the number ofpossible paths in a software module.andP;  In 1978, W.J.andP;  Hansen in his article,&quot;Measurement of Program Complexity by the Pair (Cyclomatic number, OperatorCount)&quot; [ACM SIGPLAN Notices, March], interpreted McCabe's mathematicalformula into four simple rules that would produce a numerical measure ofcomplexity (i.e., the higher the number, the more complex):andM;* Add 1 for every IF, Case or other altrenate execution construct.andM;* Add 1 for every iterative DO, DO-WHILE or other repetitive construct.andM;* Add 2 less than the number of logical alternatives in a Case.andM;* Add 1 for each AND or OR in an IF statement.andM;The results of the Kemerer and Gill study showed that increased softwarecomplexity leads to reduced productivity.andP;  They recommended the use of moreexperienced staff and a reduction of the complexity of the individualsoftware module.andP;  To reduce complexity, they suggest the establishment of acomplexity measure that could be in use as the code is written, and adherenceto this present standard.andM;According to Kemerer, &quot;The goal of these studies is to transfer the generallyaccepted processes of measurement from the manufacturing arena to thesoftware arena.andP;  The problem with the software industry is that we thinkeverything we're doing is new.&quot;andM;One way software managers are dealing with complexity is through the use ofCase tools, specifically reengineering tools.andM;Before reverse engineering became a buzzword, this would mean sitting aprogrammer down to read through the &quot;old code&quot; and write some new code.andP;  Butwith the advent of reverse engineering toolsets, this task has become easierand more structured.andM;Brunswick Data Inc. (BDI) of Saint John, New Brunswick, has used reverseengineering successfully.andP;  BDI was originally a Cobol shop.andP;  When managementdecided to move to the &quot;C&quot; platform, they needed more than just a good&quot;how-to&quot; book.andP;  To make this rather difficult transition of programmers andprograms, BDI enlisted the help of the Software Engineering and EnhancementCenter, Inc. (SEEC) in Pittsburgh.andM;SEEC assisted BDI with a two-step process.andP;  The team first selected a Casetool, Information Engineering Workbench (IEW) from Atlanta-basedKnowledgeWare, for the task of representing dataflow diagrams and structurecharts.andP;  SEEC provided consulting assistance and the all-important reusablelibraries.andM;Reusable components are key to enhancing productivity.andP;  These software&quot;chunks&quot; can be dropped into a system to jump-start the project.andP;  SEEC's Ctools consist of a screen handler, an Isam file handling facility for Unixand a report writer.andM;The BDI project's goal was to reengineer a budgetary financial system fromCobol to C using these SEEC C tools and reusable libraries.andP;  According toRavi Koka, president of SEEC, &quot;It is possible to achieve high productivityusing reusable software components.&quot;andP;  Upon completion, the team found that ithad achieved great productivity gains due to the fact that 40% of the codegenerated was reused.andM;The productivity metric utilized was this reusability percentile (40% in thiscase) and SLOC, which hovered around the 130 to 250 mark.andM;The benefits of Case and reverse engineering tools are prompting morecompanies to invest in the technology for a variety of platforms.andP;  CGISystems, Pearl River, N.Y., markets some 25 Case software packages which,according to a company spokesman, accounted for a 30% increase in revenue in1989, for a total of $205 million.andM;CGI's pivotal product, Pacbase, is a total engineering environment withfunctions of Case tools, reverse engineering and a repository.andM;CGI, SEEC and other Case tool suppliers maintain that the productivity curvegreatly increases as users begin to rely more on this stored and reusableinformation.andM;THE HEWLETT-PACKARD WAYandM;Quality and productivity have been an explicit part of Cupertino,Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard's (HP) corporate objectives.andP;  But only withinthe last two years has this filtered into the world of software development.andO;To help develop and utilize metrics company-wide, HP created the SoftwareMetrics Council.andP;  Today, 80 productivity and quality managers within HPperform a variety of functions, from training to communicating the bestsoftware engineering practices to establishing productivity and qualitymetrics.andM;HP has adopted a methodology called Total Quality Control (TQC).andP;  Afundamental principle of TQC is that all company activities can bescrutinized in terms of the processes involved; metrics can be assigned toeach process to evaluate effectiveness.andP;  HP has developed numerousmeasurements.andP;  (See Figure 3.)andM;The TQC approach places software quality/productivity assessment high on thelist of software development tasks.andP;  When projects are first defined, alongwith understanding and evaluating the process to be automated, the teamdefines the metrics that are to be used to measure the process.andM;When HP decided to revolve the future of the company around Risc-basedarchitecture, software reliability was deemed critical.andP;  The development ofthe systems software was the largest development effort in HP's history, andthe first that required multiple divisions to produce software that would becombined into a single software system.andM;Charles A. Krueger, a professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison,points out the productivity paradox of budget versus getting to market: Is itmore important to stay within the targeted confines of money allocated, or toget the product out on time?andP;  He quotes a McKinsey andamp; Co. study whichindicates that going over budget by 50% and getting a product out on timereduces profits by only 4%.andP;  But staying on budget and getting to market fivemonths late reduces profits to a third.andP;  Said Krueger, &quot;Productivity isreally a measure of how successful you are in achieving your results.&quot;andM;Hewlett-Packard came to the same conclusion as Krueger, and the companyinsisted on reliable software and delivery on time.andP;  HP established theSystems Software Certification program to ensure measurable, consistent,high-quality software through defining metrics, setting goals, collecting andanalyzing data, and certifying products for release.andP;  This program developedfour metrics for the Risc project:andM;* Breadth--measures the testing coverage of user-accessible and internalfunctionality of the product.andM;* Depth--measures the proportion of instructions or blocks of instructionsexecuted during testing.andM;* Reliability--measures the stability and robustness of a product and itsability to recover gracefully from error conditions.andM;* Defect density--measures the quantity and severity of reported defects anda product's readiness.andM;HP's results were impressive.andP;  Defects were caught and corrected early, whencosts to find and fix are lower.andP;  Less time was spent in the costly systemtest and integration phases, and on maintenance.andP;  This resulted in loweroverall support costs and higher productivity.andP;  It also increased quality forHP's customers.andM;HP's success demonstrates what a corporate-wide commitment to productivityand quality measures can achieve.andP;  The commitment to these gains was sostrong that HP invested in full-time productivity and quality managers, whichis indeed unique.andM;Perhaps the brightest spot on the measurement horizon is a concept called&quot;function points.&quot;andP;  Jones of Software Productivity Research is an authorityon the history and current usage of these newest measures.andM;In 1983, A.J.andP;  Albrecht, with IBM at that time, first proposed thefunction-point concept in a paper for IEEE Transactions on SoftwareEngineering called &quot;Software Function, Source Lines of Code and DevelopmentEffort Prediction: A Software Science Validation.&quot;andP;  This metric is acombination of metrics that assesses the functionality of the developmentprocess.andP;  It first counts the number of unique input types, output types,logical files, external interface files and external queries handled by anapplication.andM;Next, these counts are weighted depending on difficulty and further modifiedby 14 &quot;complexity factors,&quot; as defined by Albrecht.andM;As MIT's Kemerer points out, function points capture the magnitude andcomplexity of the analysis and design task.andP;  The concept has been given avote of confidence by a number of Fortune 500 firms.andP;  In fact, many of thesesame firms are voting members of a new user organization called theInternational Function Point User Group (IFPUG).andM;Most people are using function points because it is the only metric thatcomes close to matching the economic definition of productivity, which iscosts or services produced per unit of labor and expense.andP;  Using Jones' SPRresearch base of 400 studied companies, the national average was calculatedto be five function points per person-month; IT groups averaged eightfunction points per person-month.andM;These numbers can dramatically increase with Case tool usage to the degreethat it is possible to achieve 65 function points per person-month with afull Case environment and reusable code.andP;  As Jones points out, this metricwill decrease when the development environment is new, but will regainmomentum when familiarity with the toolset increases.andM;AMS' Grochow was an early believer in the function-point concept.andP;  With over2,200 systems professionals and supporting 28 product lines.andP;  AMS needed amethodology that worked.andP;  The company has been measuring productivity forover 10 years.andP;  The firm found that its traditional metrics of lines of codeand work-months was hiding some very important information: Not allwork-months are created equal.andM;According to Grochow, there are &quot;experienced people and not so experiencedpeople, expensive people and not so expensive people.&quot;andP;  If the company couldfind a way of optimizing this mix, then AMS would find increasedproductivity.andP;  To this end, AMS needed a measure that would foster economicproductivity.andP;  Function points filled the bill.andM;According to Grochow, this approach has some drawbacks.andP;  For instance, noteveryone counts function points in the same way, even though IFPUG haspublished an accounting practices manual to achieve standardization.andP;  Infact, Kemerer has been called in from MIT to review and update this process.andM;MOVING TO FUNCTION POINTSandM;There are advantages to moving from SLOC to function points.andM;The U.S.andP;  Air Force currently uses SLOC as the primary form of measurement.andO;Deputy Commander Robert Majors is in charge of four IT centers that supplydata processing services for everything from accounts payable to nonembeddeddefense systems.andP;  Their metrics are based on the Air Force Systems CommandMetric, which was developed under Department of Defense sponsorship byCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh.andP;  But with 2,200 on his payroll,Majors felt he needed a better measurement.andM;The Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, with the help of consultant andauthor James Martin, who is well-known in the IT field, suggested theutilization of function-point analysis.andP;  Using a financial accounting systemfor retrospective analysis, they determined that this particular project wasdeveloped with an average of 7 to 7.5 function points per work-month.andP;  Majorssaid he was pleased with these results and said he &quot;felt we were in theballpark range of acceptable productivity.&quot;andM;The idea of using function-point analysis in future development work isreceiving attention within the Air Force.andP;  So, too, is the idea of using Caseand reusable code.andM;First Data Resources, in Omaha, Neb., provides computer data processingservices to the credit card industry.andP;  With more than 30 million cardholderson file, First Data needs to get the systems out on time and with the highestquality.andP;  Vic Schwinghamer, director of quality assurance, admits to beingpart of the huge group of companies that was not using any measurementsystem.andP;  But that soon changed.andP;  First Data wanted to be able to measurequality, so Schwinghamer was charged with researching methodologies to dojust that.andM;Schwinghamer enlisted the help of Jones and SPR.andP;  He also obtained SPR'stoolset because he said &quot;It seemed like SPR had the most advancedmethodology.&quot;andM;During a nine-month project with SPR, where the methodologies of assessingproductivity and analysis are reviewed and taught, Schwinghamer used aproduct called Checkpoint.andP;  Running on a PC, Checkpoint uses a database ofover 4,000 projects.andP;  It is used to compare on organization's tools,environment, defect-removal technique and systems development methodologywith industry norms.andM;On the PC, the user is confronted with questions that include: What is thenature of the project?andP;  What is the scope of the project?andP;  What are theproject goals?andP;  How many steps of system methodology do you use?andP;  What arethe constraints you are operating under?andP;  What tools are you using?andP;  Inaddition, Checkpoint must be fed with a profile of the systems analyst(s)doing the work.andP;  The net result is a comparison of one firm's methodologywith the industry.andM;Schwinghamer is a great fan of function points and the Checkpoint product, inparticular.andP;  He said that &quot;function points are a measure of the output, whilewith lines of code you're just going around in circles.&quot;andM;EXPANDED VIEWPOINTandM;The IT viewpoint has expanded as software development has migrated from &quot;out&quot;to &quot;science.&quot;andP;  Software is no longer a myriad of independent program modulesthat satisfy a given user at a given time.andP;  Now, a broader view looks at afirm's software as a single entity that represents a large capital andoperating investment.andM;In moving toward this new perspective, IT groups will, according to Kemerer,have to not only &quot;build systems right, but will also have to build the rightsystems.&quot;andM;Keyes is president of New Art Inc., a New York-based consulting firmspecializing in high-tech solutions to business problems.andP;  She is the authorof the New Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence in Financial Services(Harper and Row), which is due out this fall.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
