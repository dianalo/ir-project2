Using the combined solarwind plasma and magnetic field data from ISEE 3 for the interval fromAugust 1978 through February 1980 we have identified several examplesof such shock pairs at 1 AU. Two of these shock pair events were clearlyassociated with transient disturbances rather than with corotating streams.Strong bidirectional electron heat flux events, which we identify asthe coronal mass ejecta (CME) driving the shocks, were detected duringboth of these disturbances. In the stronger of the two disturbances thereverse shock was found within the CME and was separated from the forwardshock by {similar_to}0.2 AU; the pressure was nearly constant betweenthe two shocks. On the other hand, in the weaker of the two disturbancesthe reverse shock had propagated entirely through the CME and trailedthe forward shock by {similar_to}0.3--0.4 AU; the pressure declined substantiallyand monotonically between the two shocks. The overall disturbance profilesfor these two events compare favorably with the results of previouslypublished numerical simulations. On the basis of those simulations wesuggest that these two events are prototypes of ''driven'' and ''blast''distrubances, wherein the time scale of the initial velocity perturbationnear the Sun is, or is not, short compared to the transit time to 1 AU.Our observations support the notion that reverse shocks in disturbancesare most likely to be found near the central axes of such disturbances.copyright American Geophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
