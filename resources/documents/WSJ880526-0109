Rose (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AEG BA </CO><IN> CEO AIR ARO </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Allegis Corp. plans to sharply increase capital spending on new aircraft and other equipment during the next two years in an attempt to regain lost market share.    Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said the company plans to spend $1.6 billion this year and the same amount in 1989. That would be an increase of 62% from 1987 spending of $987 million for aircraft and facilities.    Part of that effort may be disclosed at the company's annual meeting today, when the parent of United Airlines is expected to confirm that it will acquire 60 Boeing 757 aircraft, including both firm orders and options. The acquisitions are expected to be in the form of operating leases, the expense of which would be included in capital spending plans.    Although some of those new planes would replace aging aircraft at the company, the orders are expected to mean a substantial net addition to the airline's current fleet of 387 airplanes. Delivery isn't expected to start until at least next year.    Mr. Wolf, who is also chairman and chief executive of United, wouldn't discuss the aircraft orders in an interview yesterday. But he said he isn't sure that even the $1.6 spending billion plan is adequate. &quot;I'm going through life trying to figure how to escalate that,&quot; he said.    United's market share had fallen to 16.2% as of the end of last year from an industry-leading 19.6% in 1978. Now, not only has Texas Air Corp. pushed United to second place, but the American Airlines unit of AMR Corp. is rapidly gaining.    Even this year, when industry growth is projected at 5%, United expects to manage only a 2% increase in capacity. &quot;I think I'm a competitive fellow,&quot; Mr. Wolf said. &quot;I don't like to lose market share.&quot;    United officials hope that faster growth will boost earnings and revenue, and also help alleviate employee criticism, because it would increase their chances for promotion and higher pay. That is of particular concern to pilots, who now wait far longer to earn their captain's stripes than those at competitors such as American Airlines.    Mr. Wolf, although he wouldn't make specific predictions, indicated that he wouldn't quarrel with estimates that 1988 earnings from continuing operations could be as high as $7 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
