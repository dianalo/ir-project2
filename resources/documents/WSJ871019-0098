A company spokeswoman said the oil concern would &quot;explore&quot; the proposal, but another source close to Texaco said any such preferred issue was unlikely. Issuing preferred stock in lieu of dividends has never been done in a Chapter 11 proceeding, bankruptcy-law experts say.    Dennis O'Dea, counsel for the Committee of Equity Security Holders, said the proposal calls for the preferred issue to cover the two dividend payments Texaco has already missed as well as future dividends that Texaco would skip while in bankruptcy-law proceedings. Common shareholders dependent on dividends for income could then sell the preferred to raise cash, he said.    Texaco filed last April 12 for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgment against it awarded to Pennzoil Co. by a Texas jury in December 1985. That judgment arose from Pennzoil's claim that Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. had illegally interfered with a prior Pennzoil contract to acquire part of Getty.    Mr. O'Dea said the shareholders committee proposal doesn't state -- and he couldn't suggest -- the value at which the preferred stock would trade, the value of dividends already missed or how many dividends may be missed before Texaco comes out of bankruptcy-law proceedings. Last year, White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco paid $3 a share, or $722 million, in dividends to its 278,000 holders of common stock.    Texaco's board already has the authority to issue 22 million shares of preferred stock, Mr. O'Dea said. The shareholders proposal suggests that one share of preferred be issued for every 20 shares of common.    So far, the shareholders committee hasn't received any response from Texaco's board, Mr. O'Dea said. But a spokeswoman for the company didn't rule out a special issue of preferred stock. She said Texaco will &quot;explore&quot; the proposal and &quot;other thoughts&quot; with the shareholders committee.    &quot;If it's true that Texaco is preparing to make an interim payment to creditors, then it can do something for the shareholder,&quot; Mr. O'Dea said.    Texaco recently confirmed that it is considering making interim payments to most of its creditors. Such a plan could be submitted to the bankruptcy court for approval by the end of this month, sources close to the case say.    However, a source close to Texaco said that it's unlikely the company will issue a preferred-stock dividend and that the board hasn't considered the proposal. Texaco &quot;has no legal obligation to pay dividends, but it does have a legal obligation to pay creditors,&quot; the source said. &quot;Texaco would have to know beyond a doubt that all creditors would receive everything they're entitled to before it issued a preferred stock, and it's too early in the bankruptcy process to know that.&quot;    Separately, the shareholders committee petitioned the bankruptcy court for permission to hire Rothschild Inc., an investment banking firm, and the accounting firm of Peterson andamp; Co. Texaco has filed an objection to those motions, Mr. O'Dea said.    So far, none of the committees have been granted permission to hire investment bankers, explained Harvey Miller, Texaco's bankruptcy counsel. And, he added, the oil company needed additional time &quot;to review&quot; the application of the accounting firm. </TEXT></DOC>
