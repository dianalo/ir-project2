He implicitly acknowledged that the decision iscertain to ignite controversy among lawmakers unhappy withChina's human-rights and arms-control record and its tradepolicies, which have helped produce a $10 billion U.S. tradedeficit with China.   But he argued that one way to change China's performancein these areas is to maintain a healthy trade relationship.Continuing China's status as a most-favored-nation tradingpartner &quot;is a means to bring the influence of the outsideworld to bear on China,&quot; he said. &quot;Critics who attack MFNtoday act as if the point is to punish China, as if hurtingChina's economy will somehow help the cause of privatizationand human rights.&quot;   That argument won the day in Congress at this time lastyear, when China's favorable trade status was extendeddespite acute unhappiness over its 1989 crackdown onpro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Butcongressional anger toward China is just as high this year,if only because another year of favorable trade status hasn'tproduced the loosening in internal Chinese policies thatcritics demand to see.   The decision means Mr. Bush will formally notify Congressthis week that he is renewing China's MFN status for anotheryear, which would guarantee Beijing the best possibletreatment on duties and quotas available under U.S. law. Mr.Bush is required to notify Congress of his intention by June3.   Congress then will have 90 days in which it can pass aresolution blocking the trade status. If Congress doesn'tact, the preferable trade status will go into effect. IfCongress passes a resolution to block the trade status or toattach conditions to it, Mr. Bush could veto the measure andlawmakers will have to muster a two-thirds vote in bothhouses to override the veto.   The president, a former American envoy to Beijing who haslong argued against isolating China, had signaled earlierthis month that he wanted to continue China's MFN status. Butthere had been a debate inside his administration on whetherto attach some conditions on the renewal requiring that Chinaimprove its humanrights and arms-proliferation record or loseits preferential trade treatment.   In the end, Mr. Bush decided against attaching anyconditions on the MFN renewal, perhaps because he suspects hemay have to accept some imposed by Congress anyway. Already,administration officials said, lawmakers have introduced fivedifferent congressional resolutions attaching conditions toextension of MFN status.   In his speech and a lengthy background paper distributedby the White House, Mr. Bush offered a long series ofrationales for extending China's trade status.   Mr. Bush maintained that restrictive trade policies wouldparticularly hurt areas in southern China where free-marketreforms are taking hold and that they would deal a &quot;bodyblow&quot; to neighboring Hong Kong, &quot;the bastion of freedom andfree trade in the Far East.&quot;   But the most persuasive administration steps in sellingthe decision to Congress may prove to be the moves to blockmilitarily sensitive high-technology exports to China untilthe U.S. is satisfied China isn't aiding in the proliferationof missiles and nuclear weapons technology in the ThirdWorld. Mr. Bush himself didn't announce those moves; theywere disclosed to reporters by an administration official,who asserted the moves weren't specifically designed tooffset the MFN decision.   Those steps will stop the shipment of supercomputers toChina, blocking for now 20 pending licenses for the export ofsome $30 million in equipment, the official said. The U.S.also is blocking the export of militarily sensitive equipmentto a Chinese company, the Chinese Precision MachineryImport-Export Corp. U.S. officials said those steps are beingtaken directly out of concern that China has been using suchequipment to advance the sale of long-range missiles,particularly to Pakistan. The administration believes Chinais in the process of selling Pakistan the M-11, a new missilecapable of carrying nuclear warheads.   In addition, the U.S. won't issue new licenses fordelivery of satellites to China. The U.S. worries thattechnology also could be useful for long-range missiles. Asenior State Department official, Reginald Bartholomew, willtravel to China next month to discuss American concerns aboutnuclear proliferation, the official said.</TEXT></DOC>
