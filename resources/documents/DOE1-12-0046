With the aim of establishing the correlation between explosivepulse parameters and potential elastic energy for rocks during failure,the problem was set for determining the critical value of loading occurringduring explosion of a blast-hole charge and the satisfactory conditionof developing the failure process in a quasistatic approximation notleading to critical dynamic phenomena.</TEXT></DOC>
