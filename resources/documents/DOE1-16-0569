<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-0569 </DOCNO><TEXT>British Nuclear Fuels plc (BNFL) provides a comprehensive range of nuclearfuel cycle services, ie the purification and processing of uranium oreconcentrates, the enrichment of uranium, the manufacture of uranium andplutonium based fuels, the reprocessing of irradiated fuel, and the conditioningand storage of nuclear materials and radioactive wastes. Some of theseactivities give rise to discharges of radioactive isotopes to the environment.This annual report follows the pattern established in 1977 in that itgives information on radioactive discharges, through authorised and scheduledoutlets, and on environmental monitoring for all of the Company's Worksand sites, ie Sellafield Site and the Drigg Storage and Disposal Site;Chapelcross Works; Springfield Works and the Ulnes Walton Disposal Site;and Capenhurst Works. Where a site also encompasses laboratories of theUnited Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) reference is made to thesignificance of the discharges from the latter. It also includes assessmentof radiation doses to representative members of the most highly exposedgroup of the general population (the critical group) for the most importantenvironmental pathways in the vicinity of each site. Information forthe period 1971-76 inclusive has also been published by BNFL and priorto 1971, the year in which BNFL was formed, information was publishedby the UKAEA. An appendix contains certificates of Authorisation grantedby the DOE, MAFF and Scottish Office imposing limits and conditions relatingto methods of disposal and quantities to be discharged.</TEXT></DOC>
