Carlton Coleman of New Providence Church, member of the PeopleUnited to Lead the Struggle for Equality, or PULSE.   The group called for a speedy investigation into the Monday nightshooting, firing the police officer who did the shooting,first-degree murder charges against him, removal of the heavyconcentration of police officers from Overtown, and formation of acountywide Citizens Independent Review Panel.   The FBI announced Tuesday that it would investigate Mondaynight's shooting to determine whether there were civil rightsviolations, Miami bureau spokesman George Kiszynski said. He saidthe investigation would be completed ``as promptly as possible.''   The Rev. Nathaniel Graham, pastor of St. Stephen AME Church and aPULSE member, called the shooting ``nothing new. ... We knew it wasgoing to erupt. It was only a matter of time. The same thing couldhappen tomorrow. The atmosphere is out there.''   PULSE, which has representatives from some 50 groups, most ofthem black community churches, has been alleging heavy-handedtreatment by police against blacks for years. Clarence Pendleton,the late U.S. Civil Rights Commission chairman, said last year thathe would look into their complaints, but the group never receivedany results, members said.   PULSE listed 17 earlier incidents, six of them resulting indeaths, in which Miami or Metro-Dade police allegedly used excessiveviolence against blacks, starting with the 1979 beating of blackinsurance executive Arthur McDuffie. The acquittal of the whiteMetro-Dade officers charged in McDuffie's death sparked Miami's 1980riots that claimed 18 lives.   City and police officials have said PULSE has made unfairallegations. The group leaders, in a news conference joined byrelatives of some of the listed victims, said this week'sdisturbances should show it's time for their advice to be taken.   ``They (police) have turned a deaf ear,'' said the Rev. VanceEubanks of Greater New Bethelem Church. ``It's as if we're throwingwords to the wind. Now we're going to reap the whirlwind.''   They said they wanted police to do their jobs, but to besensitive to the community mood and not appear so heavy-handed.   ``We have stood side-by-side with the police force. We would bethe first ones to ask for law and order,'' Eubanks said.</TEXT></DOC>
