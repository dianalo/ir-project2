Separately, Amerada Hess Corp.'s second-quarter net more than quadrupled, helped by a one-time gain.    Despite the strong results, the stocks of both companies fell yesterday along with those of other major oil companies, apparently on uncertainty about world oil prices. Arco closed at $94, off $2. Amerada Hess ended the day at $38.875, down $1.875. Both stocks are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.    Los Angeles-based Arco's net income totaled $330 million, or $1.80 a share, up from $150 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15%, to $4.1 billion from $3.55 billion a year earlier.    Lodwrick M. Cook, Arco's chairman and chief executive officer, said the earnings jump reflected both higher crude-oil prices and lower operating costs because of restructuring.    Arco's latest-period profit includes a net gain of $35 million from settlement of disputes over natural gas and coal contracts, offset in part by nonrecurring charges that the company declined to disclose. The year-earlier quarter included a $12 million gain from a change in pension accounting.    Profit from Arco's oil and gas operations was $243 million compared with a loss of $1 million a year earlier on the strength of higher prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids. The latest result also includes $30 million of the net gain from settlements of contract disputes. The company's average price for domestic crude was $12.68 a barrel compared with $7.02 a year earlier.    Profit from refining and marketing operations tumbled 63%, to $45 million in the latest period from $121 million a year earlier, as profit margins narrowed. Product prices failed to rise as quickly as crude prices, Arco said.    The company's profit for the first six months totaled $569 million, or $3.11 a share, a 27% increase from the $449 million, or $2.47 a share, a year earlier. Revenue was little changed at $7.85 billion against $7.84 billion in the year-earlier period.    New York-based Amerada Hess's profit surged in the latest quarter to $89.4 million, or $1.06 a share, from $19.7 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 25%, to $1.16 billion from $927.1 million.    The earnings gain includes an extraordinary credit of $28.1 million, or 34 cents a share, reflecting net operating loss carry-forwards applicable to U.S. operations and certain foreign units, Hess said. Income tax benefits and charges relating to domestic operations and foreign subsidiaries weren't recorded last year, the company said.    Hess's exploration and production businesses were particularly strong, reflecting an industry trend that followed a rebound in crude oil prices. Exploration and production profit nearly tripled, to $44 million, from $15.3 million a year ago. Last year's second-quarter results included a nonrecurring gain of $12 million from the settlement of a gas sales contract.    The company's refining and marketing operations posted net earnings of $55.7 million for the quarter, up from $8.8 million a year ago.    For the six months, Hess reported profit of $270.9 million, or $3.21 a share, compared with a loss of $319.6 million a year earlier. The six-month results include a credit of $111.9 million, or $1.33 a share, reflecting net operating loss carry-forwards. Last year's loss stemmed from the drastic decline in prices of crude oil and products. </TEXT></DOC>
