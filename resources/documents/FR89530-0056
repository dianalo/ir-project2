The proposed technology develops stress dataon the above-ground drive unit with a very reliable strain gauge and aninclinometer, both placed in a unitized package with a computer at thefulcrum of the drive. The computer uses these above-ground data in well-knownand accepted formulas to continually determine forces on the pump at thebottom of the well. When these forces become too great, the computer stopsthe drive unit to prevent damage from pump-off or other causes. The computeralso continuously adjusts pumping time as a function of down-time to continuouslyreoptimize pumping economics. Mr. Glenn Albert has a licensing agreementwith the University of Oklahoma, to whom the patent was assigned to Dr.John Purcupile, the inventor, who was involved in the initial grant proceedingswith the DOE before his death.Mr. Albert has a degree in Computer Sciences. The Office of Oil and Gasin Fossil Energy of DOE believes this technology is needed, especiallyif it is reliable. They believe that pumping economics are important tothe entire oil industry and especially to the stripper-well segment.<T3>Eligibility: </T3>Based on receipt of an unsolicited application, eligibilityof this award is being limited to Mr. Albert of Albert Engineering. Themarket for this technology is the approximately 1 million operating wellsin the United States, as mentioned in the evaluation report of the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST), formerly the National Bureauof Standards.The term of this grant shall be two years from date of award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Procurement Operations, Attn: Rosemarie H.
