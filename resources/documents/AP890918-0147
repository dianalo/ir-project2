The commission, saying that Intercambio of San Jose, Calif., hadnot provided any persuasive reason why it should not be fined,ordered the company to pay the penalty within 30 days or facecriminal prosecution.   The commission, in reaffirming a July 6, 1988, notice of apparentliability, said Intercambio had raised no new material questions offact to support its contention that it had not ``violated FCCregulations'' and that the fine was ``both unjustified andunlawful.''   The FCC said the law allows for fines of $50,000 a day for eachof 70 days' violations.   The FCC on Dec. 7, 1987, first notified Intercambio that it wascontemplating action following a complaint from a mother who saidher 16-year-old son was hearing pornographic messages fromIntercambio. The woman said the boy was seeing a psychiatrist afterplacing more than 280 calls to various dial-a-porn providers duringa 2{-month period.   Intercambio told the FCC that its service was intended to beavailable only within California, that it had attempted to restrictaccess to adults and that the law regarding pornographic phonemessages and FCC rules on the subject were unconstitutional.   But the firm refused to provide any evidence to back up itsclaims, said FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis.   The commission said it had conducted a four-month investigationand found Intercambio was placing no restrictions to prevent minorsfrom dialing in. Nor did it find any restrictions in place toprevent interstate calls, the FCC said. Interstate dial-a-porn callsto minors are banned under federal law.   ``As a result of its investigation, the staff found the evidenceconclusive that Intercambio's messages were obscene and that it hadin fact operated and was continuing to operate in violation of'' thelaw, the commission said.   There was no phone number listed for Intercambio in San Jose andattempts to locate a number for Intercambio's president, DanGlassoff, were unsuccessful Monday.   Congress last year, in an attempt to wipe out the dial-a-pornindustry, outlawed the sale of indecent phone messages. But theSupreme Court in June said that only obscene material _ patentlyoffensive, sexual and without redeeming value _ may be banned.   Congress acted because of complaints from outraged parents whoincurred heavy phone bills from children dialing 976 numbers tolisten to sexually oriented material.   But the Supreme Court said that recent technological advancessuch as call blocking by phone companies assured that children couldbe kept from reaching dial-a-porn services and that the governmenthad no compelling reason to ban such calls for adults.   Another California company that also had faced a $600,000 finefor allegedly providing obscene phone messages agreed last Novemberto stop selling sexual phone messages and paid a smaller amount tothe government without admitting liability.   Mary Beth Hess, chief of the FCC's enforcement division, saidMonday that Audio Enterprises of Mill Valley, Calif., paid thegovernment $50,000 and is out of the phone sex business.   A third company, 2001 Enterprises of Reseda, Calif. agreed tostop its sexually oriented message business and paid the government$25,000, Hess said.</TEXT></DOC>
