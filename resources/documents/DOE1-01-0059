As the culminationof a 9-yr development program, this engine, designated the Mod II, alsonullifies arguments that Stirling engines are heavy, expensive, unreliable,and demonstrate poor performance. Installed in a General Motors 1985Chevrolet Celebrity car, this engine has a predicted combined fuel economyon unleaded gasoline of 17.5 km/L (41 mi/gal) - a value 50% above thecurrent vehicle fleet average.
