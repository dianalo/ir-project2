AB Volvo of Sweden, DAF Trucks B.V. of the Netherlands and MAN AG of West Germany are among several firms that have made offers for the Spanish trucks producer, the INI spokesman said.    Enasa, which makes trucks, buses and armored military vehicles, was created in 1946 from the remnants of the defunct Hispano Suiza auto company. After years of heavy losses and various unsuccessful attempts to find a purchaser, Enasa recently has shown a financial improvement, owing to cost-cutting and a more aggressive commercial strategy. Last year, Enasa reduced its loss to 5.5 billion pesetas ($45 million) from a year-earlier deficit of 12.1 billion pesetas. Revenue rose to 116 billion pesetas from 104 billion pesetas. This year, Enasa expects a further narrowing of its loss or a small profit. </TEXT></DOC>
