Shamir and Bush are to confer in Washington on April 6.   Israel radio and Arab sources said two Palestinians died ofwounds suffered earlier, and Arab reports said Israeli soldierswounded 25 Palestinians during protests in nine towns and refugeecamps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   One of the wounded was said to be a 4-month-old girl hit in thehead by a rubber bullet.   The two deaths raised to 407 the number of Palestinians killedsince an uprising began in the occupied territories more than 15months ago. Eighteen Israelis have been slain.   Seven moderate Palestinian leaders in Nablus, the West Bank'slargest city, have been threatened with death if they continuemeeting with Israeli officials about peace, Arab sources reported.   Friday's survey by the independent Modain Ezrahi organizationsaid 56 percent of 1,251 Israeli Jews chosen at random said ``no''when asked: ``Do you believe there is room for negotiating with thePLO and if so, toward what end?'' The survey's margin of error wasgiven as plus or minus 2 percent.   A survey conducted in December indicated 54 percent of Israelisfavored talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, oncondition it ceased attacking Israeli targets.   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism in December andrecognized Israel's right to exist. The United States initiatedcontacts after Arafat's public declaration and the second formalmeeting was held Wednesday in Tunis.   Rachel Israeli of Modain Ezrachi attributed the change inresponse between December and March to the fact that organizationasked only about talks without mentioning an end to terrorism orany other condition.   ``Many people do not believe the PLO has stopped their terroractivities,'' she said.   Bush was quoted in an interview published Friday in theWashington Times as saying of his forthcoming meeting with Shamir:``I will tell him that the talks that we ... are having with thePLO representatives there in Tunis are good things'' and would tryto persuade the Israeli leader ``something good might come out ofthis kind of discussion.''   Asked whether he would urge Shamir to join the talks, the papersaid, Bush replied: ``I don't know what I'll say to him about that,but I'll say to him that we have got to move the peace processforward. We may, by then, be ready with some specific ideas.''   Israeli news reports have said Bush planned to propose a firststage of negotiations with Palestinians in the occupiedterritories, with the PLO joining talks later on the final statusof the territories.   Arab sources, speaking privately, said the death threatsinvolved two masked Arab youths from a dissident PLO faction whovisited the Palestinian moderates March 17.   They identified the faction as the Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine, led by Dr. George Habash and based inSyria.   The Jerusalem Post said the men were threatened at knifepoint.It said supporters of Arafat were among them, including Dr. HatemAbu Ghazaleh, a former member of the Nablus city council.   Abu Ghazaleh was reached by telephone and denied receivingthreats.   A leaflet circulated in Arab East Jerusalem urged Palestiniansto freeze contacts with Israeli officials to prevent Shamir frompursuing plans to circumvent the PLO in peace talks, Israeltelevision reported.   In an interview with the daily Maariv, Shamir was quoted assaying he would pursue secret talks with non-PLO Palestinians.   ``There are among them wise people, intellectuals,'' Shamirsaid. ``I am not going to reveal their names because it may bringthem harm.''   Hadashot, another daily, said he might have the Shin Bet secretpolice investigate a leak last week of a secret military reportthat concluded there were no non-PLO Palestinians with whom Israelcould negotiate peace. A Shamir aide denied the report.   Marwan Abu Taman, 19, of Tulkarem in the West Bank, died Fridayof chest wounds suffered in a confrontation with soldiers two daysearlier, Arab reports said. Israel radio said Mohammed Aziz Nasser,23, died at a hospital in Arab east Jerusalem the day after anexplosive device went off in his hands.</TEXT></DOC>
