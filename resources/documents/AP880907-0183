Scattered, fragmentary reports indicated that storms killed atleast 39 people in less than a week and left tens of thousandshomeless. Many communities are without electricity, telephones ordrinking water.   As relief work went on in such hard-hit states as Veracruz,Oaxaca, Chiapas and Guerrero, Tropical Storm Florence churned inthe southern Gulf about 125 miles north-northwest of Merida on theYucatan Peninsula.   Florence's 45 mph winds strengthened Wednesday night as thestorm swirled in a stationary position. Forecasters at the NationalHurricane Center in Miami said they could not predict whatdirection it would take.   ``It's out in the open waters of the Gulf right now,''forecaster Noel Risynchok said. ``The only current threat would beto marine interests.''   The storm was expected to remain in place through Thursday, hesaid.   Florence is the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic Hurricaneseason. Only one, Debby, had winds exceeding 74 mph, making it ahurricane.   Debby hit Veracruz state Friday night. While Debby was drenchingone side of Mexico, another tropical weather system, Kristy, wassoaking the Pacific Coast.   Both spawned heavy rains that sent rivers over their banks,downed power lines, washed out roads and rail lines and forcedevacuation of tens of thousands.   Veracruz state officials said Wednesday an undetermined numberof people was still missing in flooded areas. The also said majorGulf ports and some roads were still closed.   Officials in southern Oaxaca state on the Pacific reported fivemore deaths Wednesday, raising the state toll to at least 12 andthe national toll to 39.   Veracruz officials confirmed 16 dead and Chiapas state officialsconfirmed five. Central Hildalgo state reported four dead and twodeaths were reported in Guerrero, on the Pacific.   At least half the corn crop in northern Veracruz was wiped out,a month before harvest, said state spokeswoman Guadalupe Lopez.   ``Some of the worst damage was in the orchards: citrus andbananas,'' she said, adding that flooding also damaged coffee andbeans.   Nationwide, crop damage was minimal, said Pascacio Taboada ofthe Agriculture Ministry. Most orchards will survive the flooding,he predicted.   Taboada estimated flood waters covered less than 150,000 acres,less than 1 percent of Mexico's cultivated land.   He said heavy rains filled most reservoirs to 70 percent ofcapacity, which could mean ample water to irrigate the fall andspring crops.</TEXT></DOC>
