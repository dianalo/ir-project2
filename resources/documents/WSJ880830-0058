RAI, Hauppauge, N.Y., is a battery separator and membrane maker. Pall is a filter maker based in Glen Cove, N.Y..    As reported earlier, Pall will swap one of its shares for each 2.75 shares of RAI. The merger is valued at $25 million.    RAI and Pall had said the closing of their merger might be postponed until at least Nov. 30, pending evaluation of chemical-waste contamination at an RAI plant in Suffolk County, N.Y. However, yesterday RAI said it had reached an agreement with the county on a cleanup program that would allow the merger to be completed Sept. 30. </TEXT></DOC>
