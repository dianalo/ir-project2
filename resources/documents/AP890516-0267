The spinoff of Seymour Cray's latest research project into aseparate company, announced late Monday, prompted Cray Researchstock to plunge $6 a share to $49.75 in heavy trading Tuesday onthe New York Stock Exchange.   Seymour Cray said he does not intend to take on additionalinvestors in forming Cray Computer Corp. The company will start asa wholly owned subsidiary of Cray Research and evolve within a yearinto a company owned by existing Cray shareholders.   The new company will receive $100 million in operating funds and$50 million in assets in the next two years from Cray Research.   ``What I'm getting is all the money I wanted,'' said Cray, whowill be chairman of the Colorado Springs, Colo., company. ``I don'tthink I can spend more than $100 million.''   In another development Tuesday, Minneapolis-based Cray Researchannounced plans to sell its supercomputers to customers of TwinCities neighbor Control Data Corp. Control Data on April 17 shutdown its fledgling ETA Systems supercomputer subsidiary after itlost $238 million in five years.   How much money Control Data will receive for selling Cray'smachines under the new joint marketing agreement is not known, saidThomas Charland, a Control Data spokesman.   Seymour Cray gave birth to the supercomputer industry in 1972after he was pushed out of Control Data _ another company he helpedfound _ because his research was getting too expensive, he said. Hehad gone to Control Data in 1957 because his role at a St. Paulcomputer maker was shrinking in an expansion fueled by hisinnovations. The company was a forerunner to Univac Corp., whichhas evolved into Unisys Corp.   ``It's been a circular career path,'' Cray told a crowdedauditorium at the company's annual shareholders' meeting. ``Onceagain I'm hearing, `You've got a nice little project there. Here'ssome money _ now go start you're own company.'''   Under the restructuring, Cray Research will be able to focus onits bread-and-butter Y-MP machines, which are produced in ChippewaFalls, Wis. Cray Chairman John Rollwagen said Tuesday that it hadbecome too costly to fund both computer projects. Cray devoted $30million last year to the Cray-3, which won't be unveiled until1990, he said.   Rollwagen also said customers were sometimes perplexed about thecompetition within the company. Some were frustrated with having tochoose between the Y-MP and the Cray-3, he said.   The textbook solution, Rollwagen said, would have been to settleon one technology and shut down the other. But such a move wouldhave stifled America's competitiveness in an industry targeted bythe Japanese, especially because of ETA's failure, he said.   ``By having two companies at least we have more odds,''Rollwagen said. ``There's a backup plan if one fails.''   Marcelo Gumucio, president and chief operating officer at Cray,said NEC Corp. is the most formidable of three Japanesecompetitors. But by Cray's calculations, Japan's threesupercomputer makers account for only about 14 percent of allinstalled central processing units in the world. Cray's 485 centralprocessing units account for 76 percent and ETA machines accountfor 10 percent, Gumucio said.   Seymour Cray said he had mixed feelings about leaving, but hedenied rumors that he was at odds with management.   ``I wasn't dissatisfied,'' Cray said. ``We both have had all theresources we needed up until now.''   He said the Cray-3, the first supercomputer to use the galliumarsenide metal alloy as a semiconductor, will be demonstrated bythe end of this year. Sales should begin by 1990, but at a slowerpace than Cray Reserach had projected, he said.   The two companies will enter cross-licensing and technologytransfer agreements involving both hardware and software. But bythe mid-1990s they should be all-out competitors, Rollwagen said.   ``I think we have two fearless organizations here,'' Cray said.``So may the best technology win. In the long-term, I thinktechnology will rule the day.''   Before the spinoff can occur, approvals on the stock offeringare needed from the Internal Revenue Service and Securities andExchange Commission. Existing Cray shareholders would receive atleast 90 percent of the stock in the new company, Rollwagen said.The rest would be held by Cray Research and officers of the newcompany.</TEXT></DOC>
