Theplant operated very successfully the first half of 1986, but encounterednumerous problems after a mid-year scheduled maintenance period, whichessentially kept the plant off line the months of September, Octoberand November. Two significant events have occurred in the contractingarea. The SDG andamp; E - DOE Cooperative Agreement was modified to reducethe demonstration period to one year, and San Diego has entered negotiationswith the heat suppliers over terms in the Heat Sales contract. The latestpreliminary schedule calls for full brine supply in November/December1987, and a one year demonstration period. If the expected economic projectionsfor the demonstration period prove accurate, SDG andamp; E is expected to placethe plant into commercial operation at the end of the demonstration period.</TEXT></DOC>
