Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui, speaking at a newsconference yesterday, declared the termination of a period ofemergency rule imposed just before the Communists tookcontrol of China in the late 1940s. That emergency froze inplace a state of war with the Communists that, despite someperiods of cooperation, extended back to the late 1920s.Until now, the Kuomintang government in Taipei has officiallyviewed the Beijing government as rebels who had usurped theKMT's rightful authority to rule mainland China.</LP><TEXT>   President Lee's proclamation, which came as aquasi-official Taiwan delegation visited Beijing for thefirst wide-ranging talks ever held with mainland officials,represents another important step in the gradual relaxationof tensions across the Taiwan straits. With Taiwaninvestments on the mainland exceeding $2.5 billion last yearand indirect trade totaling some $4 billion, many Taiwanesehave been awaiting such a shift in policy to confirm thenormalization of informal relations that has taken placesince the late 1980s.   &quot;The mainland now is under the control of the ChineseCommunists, and this is a fact we must face,&quot; the presidentsaid in answer to a question. &quot;We'll regard the ChineseCommunists as a political entity that controls the mainland,and we'll call them the `mainland authorities' or the`Chinese Communist authorities,'&quot; he added. In the past,Taipei called the Beijing government &quot;bandits&quot; or &quot;aseditious organization.&quot;   The president reiterated his government's position thatTaiwan won't attempt to regain the mainland by force -- astance that was a cornerstone of policy for years after theKuomintang was ejected from mainland China. But he alsocalled on China to renounce the use of force in pursuingreunification with Taiwan, something that the Beijinggovernment refuses to do.   &quot;If the Chinese Communist regime won't give up using forcein the Taiwan straits and keeps isolating us in theinternational community, then we can only believe them to bea hostile political entity,&quot; President Lee said. Thepresident called for Taiwan to &quot;strengthen its defensecapability.&quot;   The proclamation ending the Period of Mobilization forSuppression of the Communist Rebellion was accompanied by theimplementation of constitutional amendments passed last monthby a special session of the National Assembly. The assemblyapproved a series of amendments that abrogated an emergencydecree attached to the constitution when the period ofmobilization was declared. Other amendments set the stage forelections for a new National Assembly later this year, andinserted in the constitution certain emergency presidentialpowers originally embedded in the emergency decree.   As the president spoke, a delegation from Taiwan's StraitsExchange Foundation was holding initial discussions inBeijing on a range of practical issues that have arisen asbusiness, family and tourism ties between Taiwan and Chinahave increased. The foundation is a nongovernmentalorganization that is supervised by a cabinet-level counciland has no power to discuss political issues.   But with the Beijing talks attracting headlines, thepresident appeared to go out of his way to damp speculationof any imminent breakthrough in the political relationship.He restated the government's position that official talksbetween Taipei and Beijing must wait for a later stage afterthe Communist authorities have demonstrated their peacefulintentions. &quot;We could wait for 10 years or 20 years,&quot; hesaid.   Business leaders in Taiwan had mixed reactions to thepresident's proclamation, which had been expected since hiselection last May. Many businessmen view most governmentinitiatives toward the mainland skeptically, because theybelieve the Taiwan authorities aren't willing to addresstheir practical needs in such areas as shipping, finance andlegal protection.   &quot;This really has no significance beyond the fact that thegovernment can't any longer call someone a traitor&quot; simplyfor doing business with the mainland, one business leadersaid.   But some scholars say the end of mobilization doesrepresent an important step in fostering a new relationshipwith Beijing. &quot;This is significant in the sense that we willrenounce the fiction we clung to before that we represent thewhole of China,&quot; says Chi Su, deputy director of theInstitute of International Relations, Taiwan's mainChina-watching institution. &quot;This is pretty important bothfor developing our foreign relations and for developingrelations with China.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
