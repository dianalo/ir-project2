others, only a smattering.andP;  In most cases, though, the greatestbenefit of attending a show isn't just seeing new products, but ratheridentifying trends.andM;This summer's Macworld Expo in Boston didn't stand out (except that the airconditioning worked for a change).andP;  There were a few highlights, such asVentura Publisher on the Mac (see p. 30 of our last issue) and Caere's TypistOCR scanning system (see below).andP;  But the biggest story was the sudden rushinto digital media.andM;A year ago, few vendors had used the term &quot;multimedia.&quot;andP;  Last month atMacworld Expo, that word was plastered prominently on more booths than wecould count.andP;  This buzzword is redhot.andM;Our Digital World conference (see Vol.andP;  4, p. 12) explored the merger ofdigital technologies from diverse industries, ranging from publishing toentertainment.andP;  Macworld Expo was a gold mine of recent and forthcomingproducts that mix digital information on the desktop in all sorts offascinating ways.andM;Elsewhere in this issue, we examine the booming field of digital video (seep. 3).andP;  We'll use these pages to describe products from other fields thatcaught our eyes in Boston.andP;  Some of the products mentioned in separatestories within this Latest Word section were also on display at MacworldExpo.andM;Scanner/OCR vendorsandM;think smallandM;Like most recent trade shows, Macworld Expo featured more news about handheldscanners than about full-sized models.andP;  The lure of carrying a scanner inyour briefcase (or, in the case of the Macworld crowd, your knapsack) is amighty one.andP;  Price tags one digit shorter help too.andM;As a quick snapshot of the state of this art, here is a sampling of thevendors featuring handheld scanners.andM;* Asuka Technologies.andP;  This subsidiary of the Tokyo-based Accel Company sellsboth an 8-bit gray-scale scanner ($499 with NuBus interface, $599 withexternal SCSI interface) and a 12-bit color model ($649 NuBus, $799 SCSI).andO;It also has gained exclusive distribution of Blue Solutions' PhotoPressgray-scale and color image enhancement and retouching software, which it iscurrently offering free to dealers with each scanner purchased.andM;* Logitech.andP;  The focus here was on a new version (2.1) of software for theScanMan Model 32 ($499), a five-bit gray-scale scanner.andP;  The software'svaunted scan-merging feature looked rudimentary, merely enabling the user topush scans together and stop when they were satisfactorily merged, but therewas a nice screen memory optimizer, which expanded the active area of thescreen when necessary and reduced it when possible.andM;* Marstek.andP;  The Mac-800 (limited-time offer: $399 bundled with SiliconBeach's Digital Darkroom software) produces 800-dpi, 64-gray-level images viasoftware from a true 400-dpi scanner.andM;Caere unveils Typist.andP;  As the OCR market has mushroomed, many vendors havereleased special versions of their software for use with hand scanners.andP;  Somefirms have even developed OCR for use only with these portable input devices.andM;No matter how good the software was, though, it could only perform well witha clear image.andP;  Occasional users of hand scanners were often frustrated byproblems controlling speed or skew.andM;Caere, known for its OmniPage OCR products and for its newer high-endParallel Reader (see page 9), decided to build its own hand scannerspecifically for OCR.andP;  It unveiled this unit, dubbed the Typist, at MacworldExpo.andM;The Typist boasts impressive specs.andP;  Although its resolution of 300 dpi isn'tnoteworthy, its image clarity is bolstered by a pair of yaw-resistant rollersthat keep the scanner moving in a straight line.andP;  The Typist is alsospeed-sensitive: if the user pushes it faster (up to two inches per second),it inputs pixels faster to prevent image distortion.andP;  It can scanhorizontally or vertically.andM;The scanner's design is ergonomically friendly.andP;  Its curved shape fits thepalm easily.andP;  Its single button is easy to press.andP;  And its display window iscurved so that the user can see the image from a distance.andM;Handled through a Macintosh desk accessory (a PC version will use a TSRprogram), the Typist can produce input directly into an application program.andM;The Typist is bundled with a version of OmniPage software, so it canautomatically recognize page areas.andP;  One drawback is that the user cannotspecify zones; problems can arise if the software does not &quot;decompose&quot; a pageproperly.andM;Image capture software will enable the user to store scans in PCX, TIFF orPICT format.andM;Although Caere was demonstrating the Typist, some vital software componentswere not yet in place, including all graphics functions and the algorithm forstitching scans together (necessary for any document components wider thanfive inches).andP;  It recognized a single column of text well, but the sternesttest will come when it tries to combine multiple scans.andM;Typist for the Macintosh ($695), which will include a SCSI connector, willrun on an SE or better with at least 4 MB of RAM.andP;  The PC version ($595),available in AT- or MCA-bus configurations, will require a '286 or fastermachine with at least 2 MB of RAM above the basic 640K.andP;  The Mac version isslated for release through mass-market channels in September; the PC version,in the fourth quarter.andM;Price could be an obstacle for some customers; hand scanner/OCR combinationsare available for less money.andP;  However, none of the other current software islikely to beat Caere's for features or accuracy, and other hand scanners arenot as well designed for painless acquisition of readable-quality images.andM;Easy to carry, easy to use and relatively easy to afford, the Typist could(if it performs up to its potential) be a catalyst in pushing OCR to a newlevel of market acceptance.andP;  It can sit on a crowded desk; it can be movedeasily between offices; and it can be combined with a well-configured lap-topcomputer to form a full portable text scanning system.andP;  Watch for a Typist atyour local library--or take one there yourself.andP;  (But don't break anycopyright laws!)andM;Dest combines handheld, edgefeed.andP;  An astute vendor is always looking forunfilled market niches.andP;  Dest spied a gap between desktop scanners, which canhandle volume work but are too bulky to move easily, and handheld scanners,which are convenient but best suited for small tasks.andP;  It has filled this gapwith Personal Scan.andM;Comprising a removable scan unit and a base with an edgefeed mechanism,Personal Scan performs double duty.andP;  It scans at 300 dpi with 64 gray levels.andO;Unlike previous hand scanners, it can scan a full 8-1/2&quot; page in one pass.andO;And its edgefeed base holds a 10-page automatic document feeder.andM;We saw an identical scanner, Lightspeed Technology's Lightscan 400P, atComdex this spring (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  11, p. 32).andP;  But Dest claims to havethe exclusive North American marketing rights for this type of scanner.andM;Personal Scan could not be demonstrated at Macworld Expo, so we can't commenton its quality.andP;  Although the PC-compatible version (which includes a 16-bitinterface card) was released in July, the Mac version is not due untilOctober.andM;Personal Scan, complete with Dest's new omnifont OCR program Recognize (whichwe intend to look at soon), sells for $995.andP;  This system should be aninteresting competitor for Caere's new Typist, a combination of a handheldscanner and OCR software (see above).andP;  Personal Scan's advantages includeautomatic document feeding and the ability to scan a full page in one pass;the Typist's good points are its lower price and its easier-to-carry,swerve-resistant scan unit.andM;Dest also touted itself as the first vendor to use Claris's XTND interchangeapproach in its OCR software.andP;  As Claris adds to its programs' abilities totranslate among different file formats, Recognize will also gain thoseabilities.andM;Olduvai: omnifont and forms recognition.andP;  Olduvai, maker of the OCR programRead-It, announced and previewed a new higher-powered product, Read-It OCRPro Version 3.0.andP;  The biggest enhancements will be omnifont recognition andautomatic page definition, which separates the page into text and graphicsblocks.andM;Like its toughest omnifont OCR contenders, Pro 3.0 will support multipagedocuments and automatic document feeders.andP;  It will be able to run in thebackground under MultiFinder.andP;  The user will be able to &quot;teach&quot; it difficultcharacters to buttress its recognition ability.andM;Olduvai is not shying away from challenging such Mac OCR software leaders asOmniPage and AccuText.andP;  Although we can't rate Read-It Pro 3.0's accuracy orspeed yet, we were impressed with the breadth of the prerelease version'sfeature set.andM;Pro 3.0, scheduled for a fourth-quarter release, will list for $595.andP;  A&quot;personal&quot; version for use with handheld scanners will be released around thesame time for $295.andM;Another Olduvai program due in the fourth quarter is ReadForm, designed for&quot;forms scanning and recognition.&quot;andP;  After scanning a document, the userinteractively defines and numbers zones, telling the program what sort ofcharacters each is likely to contain.andP;  This collection of zones can be savedas a reusable template.andP;  A special feature called Marker recognizes responsesto multiple-choice questions.andM;ReadForm will list for $895 with built-in OCR capability.andP;  A version designedto work with Read-It Pro 3.0 will cost $295.andM;XIS polishes AccuText.andP;  The latest version of Xerox Imaging Systems' Mac OCRsoftware, AccuText 2.0, balances substantive improvements with cosmetic ones.andM;Clearly (but not overwhelmingly) faster processing and better dot-matrixrecognition highlight the new release.andP;  The ability to recognize and savebold text as bold fills a crucial gap.andP;  And a feature that lets the userblock out halftones prevents the program from wasting time trying to &quot;read&quot;them.andM;On the cosmetic side, scroll bars make it easier to set scanner brightnessand contrast.andP;  When the user defines a number of columns, rules are displayedover the scanned image.andP;  Other user interface features have been improved.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
