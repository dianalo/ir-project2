REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two masked men fatally stabbed a U.S.Navy lieutenant in his home near the Subic Bay Naval Base in anapparent robbery, police said Sunday.   U.S. officials ordered all personnel restricted to the naval baseimmediately following the Saturday night attack, but lifted therestrictions Sunday after determining the killing was notpolitically motivated.   Police identified the stabbing victim as Lt. Richard Brown, 33,who was assigned to the Navy Supply Depot at the base. No home townwas given for the victim.   Meanwhile, hundreds of Filipino troops drove throughCommunist-held neighborhoods in the city of Angeles near theU.S.-run Clark Air Base Saturday in a show of force after U.S.troops were restricted to the garrison for security reasons.   The Philippine military also warned foreign aid workers to watchfor terrorism. Five days ago, guerrillas suspected of belonging tothe New People's Army kidnapped a Japanese development official onthe central island of Negros.   The provincial governor of Negros Occidental province on Sundaythreatened military action to free the Japanese aid worker unlesshis abductors make contact with authorities soon.   Security has been stepped up around Subic, Clark and four otherU.S. bases following the killing of three American servicemen in thepast month.   In Olongapo, the base town near Subic, police said Brown washaving a manicure in his apartment when the two assailants forcedtheir way in around 10:45 p.m. Saturday.   The assailants, whose faces were covered with T-shirts, locked upthe three Filipino women beauticians in a room, threatening to killthem if they resisted, police said.   Police said the suspects fled after ransacking the apartment. Thewomen managed to free themselves and found Brown's bloody body inthe dining room, police said. It was not known how much money orproperty was stolen.   Suspected Communist rebels killed Marine Gunnery Sgt. JohnFredette on May 4 in Olongapo, 50 miles west of Manila. On May 13,two U.S. airmen were slain near Clark.   The Marxist New People's Army claimed responsibility for killingthe airmen but has issued no statement on the Fredette slaying.   In Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila, 500 troops and policebacked by armored personnel carriers motored through the streetsbrandishing M-16 rifles and carrying banners denouncing theCommunist rebels. The motorcade passed before Clark.   Philippine police Lt. Col. Julius Yarcia announced the formationof neighborhood vigilante groups to help fight the rebels.   ``We just want to convince the people that we are willing tofight and that we have the manpower and the firepower to fight theenemy,'' Yarcia said.   The New People's Army, the military wing of the outlawedCommunist Party of the Philippines, has waged a 21-year-oldinsurgency to establish a Marxist state.   On Friday, U.S. officials announced renewed restrictions on the20,300 troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependentsat Clark, largest of the six U.S. bases in the Philippines.   Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand said military personnelliving there were restricted to base and that those living off-postwere told to confine travel to ``essential'' business.   In a statement broadcast Saturday by the U.S. military's Far EastNetwork, Rand said there had been no incidents involving Americansbut the restrictions were ordered because of ``current threatconditions.''   He said security patrols around the sprawling base have beendoubled to protect American lives.   Because of the restrictions at Clark, the number of personneltaking part in Cope Thunder, a two-week Air Force training exercisescheduled to begin Monday, has been cut by 10 to 20 percent, said anAir Force spokesman in Hawaii.   ``I want to make it clear that we are not scaling back theexercise because of any terroristic activities,'' said Maj. JamesPasierb, public affairs officer at Pacific Air Forces headquartersat Hickam Air Force Base.   Philippine intelligence sources said on condition of anonymitythat rebel troop movements Friday prompted the restrictions on Clarkpersonnel. Angeles has been a Communist stronghold since the 1940s.   Yarcia said that in addition to the civilian vigilantes, twocompanies of troops from the elite Philippine Constabulary RegionalSpecial Action Force would be sent to Angeles to augment the threebattalions stationed in the city.   U.S. officials had imposed restrictions after rebels killed U.S.Airmen John Raven and James Green, but relaxed them 12 days later onMay 25. The two were slain outside a hotel in Angeles a day beforeU.S. and Philippine officials began talks on a new lease for theU.S. bases.   Communist rebels oppose an extension of the lease, which expiresnext year. More talks between Philippine and U.S. negotiators areexpected by July.   Eight Americans have been slain in politically motivated violencesince April 1989.   In Bacolod, 300 miles south of Manila, Brig. Gen. Raymundo Jarquesaid Saturday that rebels might target foreign government andprivate relief workers throughout the Philippines to discourageforeign assistance.   Last Tuesday, suspected rebels abducted Fumio Mizuno, 36,training director of Japan's Organization for Industrial, Spiritualand Cultural Advancement, at a silkworm farm near Bacolod.   ``The reason for the abduction of Mizuno was to stop foreign aidin the province,'' Jarque said. Military sources said they believedMizuno was alive but they had received no message from his abductors.</TEXT></DOC>
