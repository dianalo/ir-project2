The Bank of Canada's influential bank rate fell 0.27percentage point to 13.07%, its lowest level since February.The bank rate, which has declined for eight consecutiveweeks, is the levy the central bank charges on loans tofinancial institutions.</LP><TEXT>   The drop was followed by a decline in the prime lendingrates of most commercial banks to 14.25% from 14.75%, whichwas the first across-the-board prime rate cut since October1987. The Bank of Montreal lowered its prime rate to 14.25%earlier this week.   In a surprise move yesterday, the central bank failed toresist market pressures to drive three-month treasury billrates below the 13.05% level. The bank rate is set each weekat 0.25 percentage point above the average yield onthree-month bills at the Thursday auction.   Aron Gampel, senior economist with Bank of Nova Scotia,said the decline in interest rates reflected the continuingstrength of the Canadian dollar, which has been pushed up inrecent weeks to its highest level in 10 years. Mr. Gampelsaid the Canadian currency has been buoyed by wide spreadsbetween comparable Canadian and U.S. short-term interestrates and by higher oil prices.   Mr. Gampel said the Bank of Canada has lowered interestrates in recent weeks to offset the contractionary effect ofa higher Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada has estimatedthat a one percentage point rise in the Canadian dollar isroughly equivalent to a 0.50 percentage point decline inshort-term interest rates.   The Canadian dollar fell on the interest rate decline,closing in Toronto at 87.09 U.S. cents, down from 87.44 U.S.cents on Wednesday.   The Toronto Stock Exchange composite share index rose 1.91points to close at 3509.99 yesterday.   Patti Croft, an economist with the Toronto-basedsecurities firm Burns Fry Ltd., said the interest ratedecline also reflected, in part, &quot;mounting evidence ofweakness&quot; in the Canadian economy. In May, the most recentmonth for which data is available, Canada's gross domesticproduct fell 0.2% from the previous month.   Derek Jones, senior economist with Canadian Imperial Bankof Commerce, said yesterday's interest rate decline wasunlikely to prevent the onset of a &quot;mild recession&quot; inCanada. But Mr. Jones said the cut would &quot;slow the rate ofdeterioration in the Canadian economy.&quot;   Analysts predicted that short-term Canadian interest rateswill continue to decline moderately in coming weeks as longas the Canadian dollar remains firm.   Bank of Nova Scotia's Mr. Gampel said the central bankwill maintain a &quot;cautious&quot; monetary policy because it isstill concerned about inflationary pressures in the economy,including recent high wage settlements and higher energyprices.   Statistics Canada is to report today Canada's consumerprice index for July. Randall Powley, senior economist withScotia-McLeod Inc., estimated that the index rose 0.6% inJuly from a month earlier and 4.3% from a year earlier. Hesaid the year-over-year rate is likely to climb up to the 5%range in coming months, partly because of higher energycosts.   Mr. Powley predicted that Canadian short-term interestrates will level off later this year as the introduction ofthe government's proposed 7% consumption tax approaches. Thenew tax, which is to be introduced Jan. 1, if it is approvedby the Canadian Senate, is expected to boost Canada'sconsumer price index by a one-time increase of 1.25percentage points.</TEXT></DOC>
