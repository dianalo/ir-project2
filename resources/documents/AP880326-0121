The attorneys, including one involved in the New Jersey trial,said they expected the documents would lead to the first verdictagainst a tobacco company in a product-liability case. And now thatthe documents are a matter of public record, their availabilitywill substantially reduce the cost of pretrial proceedings in othercases, the attorneys said.   ``This is a product that is as dangerous as alcohol and asaddictive as heroin,'' said Professor Richard Daynard of theTobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University.``The evidence shows that.''   The project, which assists attorneys involved in suits againsttobacco companies, brought together lawyers involved in more than100 tobacco liability cases nationwide as part of its fourthanniversary conference.   A lawyer for cigarette maker Philip Morris Cos., one of thedefendants in the New Jersey case, said Daynard and other attorneysat the conference were taking the documents out of context. Theattorney, Charles R. Wall, also criticized the group for discussingthem while the New Jersey was still under way.   ``These issues will be decided in the courtroom where theyshould be decided,'' Wall said. ``We disagree that there has beenproof that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.''   Daynard and others at a Northeastern news conference said pastcases blaming smoking for deaths have failed because ofinsufficient evidence that tobacco companies knew smoking was orpossibly was a health hazard.   The documents gathered for the New Jersey trial include internaltobacco industry memos dating back to 1946 in which researchers forcigarette makers discuss growing evidence of a link between smokingand lung cancer and heart and respiratory problems.   They also include verification that cigarette makers developedless dangerous cigarettes, and memos in which the companies areadvised that marketing those products would amount to an admissionthat other cigarettes were dangerous.   Don Davis, an attorney in a Mississippi tobacco-liability casethat ended in a mistrial in January, said he hopes to use some ofthe documents as evidence at the retrial.   William Townsley, a lawyer from Beaumont, Texas, called onCongress to investigate the tobacco industry. He charged thatcigarette makers flouted laws that require manufacturers to warnconsumers of hazards or potential hazards of their products.   Wall maintained that tobacco industry documents discussingpossible health risks were part of industry reviews that containedconflicting opinions.   ``I don't believe these documents are incriminatory in anyway,'' he said. ``They show that the industry was concerned aboutthe charges against the product.''   Alan Darnell, one of the attorneys representing the estate ofRose Cipollone in the New Jersey suit against three cigarettemakers, said the tobacco industry has a history of funding newstudies of the harmful effects of smoking to create the impressionthat the link between smoking and health problems is inconclusive.   ``They did worse than doing nothing,'' he said. ``What they didwas a sham.''   The Cipollone case is expected to go to the jury in May. Shedied of lung cancer in 1984 at the age of 58 and had smoked for 40years.</TEXT></DOC>
