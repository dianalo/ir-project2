Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, ashe detailed a Pentagon budget bill approved Thursday bycongressional negotiators.   Nunn was the prime mover behind a series of committee hearingslast month at which Pentagon officials said giving them increasedanti-drug responsibilities would hurt the military's main missionof being ready to defend the nation against enemies.   The House had earlier voted to order President Reagan to havethe Pentagon essentially seal U.S. borders against drug traffickerswithin 45 days. The Senate approved arrest powers for Navy officersaboard warships which stop drug boats on the high seas.   Both proposals were dropped in the final version of the bill.   The final measure does order the Pentagon to improve and expandits role in providing anti-drug intelligence to civilian lawenforcement agencies, including more extensive tracking of shipsand planes.   The $300 billion bill also sharply reduces Reagan's Star Warsanti-missile plan, although it has money for thousands of missiles,planes, tanks and other weapons.   The measure, which authorizes Pentagon spending for the fiscalyear beginning Oct. 1, must now be passed separately by the Houseand Senate before going to the White House for Reagan's signature.   The bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion. Thetotal is a slight reduction from the $301 billion authorized in thecurrent year and marks the fourth straight year of either freezingor reducing the defense budget, following large increases duringReagan's first term.   The Pentagon spending bill authorizes $4.0 billion for theStrategic Defense Initiative, as Reagan's 5-year-old Star Wars planis formally known. Reagan had sought $4.8 billion for the program,up $900 million from the $3.9 billion this year.   The bill also sharply restricts spending for the space-basedinterceptor, the weapon planned as a first phase of an eventual SDIprogram. The Pentagon had sought $330 million for the program, butthe bill restricts the total to only $85 million.   Other highlights of the bill:</TEXT><TEXT>   PAY RAISES _ The nation's 2.1 million uniformed militarypersonnel will receive a 4.1 percent pay increase.   NUCLEAR WEAPONS _ The measure proposes $250 million each for thesingle-warhead Midgetman and the railroad version of the MX, a pairof land-based nuclear missiles. Reagan wanted only $200 million forthe Midgetman, which is strongly backed by Democrats who controlboth chambers, and $793 million for the MX. The bill containsanother $250 million that the secretary of defense in the newadministration next year can spend for either program.   ARMS CONTROL _ The measure requires withdrawal and retirement ofthree aging missile-firing Poseidon submarines as newmissile-firing boats are introduced into the fleet. That continuesthe policy of generally keeping the United States near weaponslimits imposed by the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty, a pactReagan says he won't follow.   The bill also provides that the Energy Department should preparefor a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests, a longtime goalof arms control supporters.   NAVY SHIPS _ The bill includes money for one more Tridentmissile-firing submarine, a pair of Los Angeles-class attack subs,the first of a new Seawolf-class of attack subs, three destroyers,and an amphibious assault ship.   OTHER WEAPONS _ The measure provides money for 180 F-16 jetfighters, 36 F-15 fighters, a dozen F-14 jets for the Navy, 84FA-18 jets for Navy carriers, 24 AV-8 Harrier jets, four of the newlong-range C-17 cargo planes, 669 M-1 tanks, 581 Bradley FightingVehicles for the Army, 1,310 Standard missiles and 72 Apache attackhelicopters for the Army,</TEXT></DOC>
