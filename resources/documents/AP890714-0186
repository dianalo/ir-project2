Mitchell's announcement represented a compromise between thoseseeking quick action on an amendment and those urging caution beforemodifying the Constitution. However, by scheduling a Senate vote onthe amendment, Mitchell increased pressure on a resistant HouseSpeaker Thomas S. Foley to do the same.   ``It is my belief that this is a serious matter of importance toall Americans,'' said Mitchell, D-Maine, adding that the compromiseschedule would let the Senate approach the issue ``in a serious,mature, deliberate way.''   Republican leader Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., on Tuesday willintroduce the constitutional amendment supported by President Bush.Dole said Mitchell's agreement ensures that opponents of aconstitutional amendment won't be able to use the statute to scuttlefurther action.   ``That satisfies the concerns ... that we might pass a statuteand say `Well, that's the end of it,''' Dole said.   Under the bipartisan agreement, the Senate Judiciary Committeewould hold hearings and then report both approaches to the fullSenate by Sept. 22.   Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., would bring up thestatute just before a Senate recess in early October, and theconstitutional amendment would lead the Senate schedule right afterthe recess.   A majority of the Senate, including members from both parties,has agreed to co-sponsor the constitutional amendment, said Dolespokesman Walt Riker.   Under the Constitution, a two-thirds vote in both chambers isrequired. A constitutional amendment also requires ratification bythe states.   The House constitutional law subcommittee has begun hearings andthe full House could act on a statute before the Augustcongressional recess. Statute supporters, including Foley, D-Wash.,hope passions for a constitutional amendment may cool after thesummer break.   A top aide to House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who isco-sponsoring the constitutional amendment, said Mitchell'sannouncement will ``turn up the burners here in the House.''   The aide, who spoke on the condition his name not be used, saidif House leaders block a floor vote on the constitutional amendmentthe bill would be taken out of the House Judiciary Committee by adischarge petition.   ``If the Senate passes a constitutional amendnent, I expect adischarge petition would happen pretty quick,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
