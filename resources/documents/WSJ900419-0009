DeKalb Genetics Corp., a commercial seed producer, and ajoint U.S. Department of Agriculture-Monsanto Co. team bothannounced they had successfully produced fertile, geneticallyaltered corn plants capable of passing their new genes on tosucceeding generations.</LP><TEXT>   The feat opens the way to making corn, the nation'sbiggest crop, resistant to disease, drought and herbicides,as well as to increasing its nutritional value.   A similar bioengineering claim was made in January byBioTechnica International Inc. Unlike DeKalb and theUSDA-Monsanto team, however, BioTechnica has declined to saywhat genes it inserted into corn plants and what technique itused.   Getting new genes into corn also has implications forother key grain crops such as wheat and rice. Until now,inserting new genes into plants has been successful only in aclass of plants known as &quot;dicots,&quot; those that produce twoleaf-like growths called cotyledons when their seeds firstsprout. Tomatoes, tobacco and rapeseed are among the dicotsthat have been successfully engineered genetically.   Corn, as well as wheat, rice and other cereals, is amongthe &quot;monocots&quot; that produce only a single cotyledon onsprouting and that have defied attempts at geneticengineering. While scientists have been able to get new genesinto monocot plants, the plants previously have ended upsterile and unable to pass the new genes on in their seed.   DeKalb said its scientists had used a &quot;gene gun&quot; to firemicroscopic pellets into test-tube cultured cells of the cornplant. The pellets were coated with a gene that produces aresistance to the herbicide bialaphos. Cells thatincorporated the new gene were identified by the fact thatthey survived treatment with bialaphos. The geneticallyaltered cells were then grown into full-sized corn plantsthat, in turn, produced seed resistant to the herbicide.   The bialaphos-resistance gene was used only because itserved as a &quot;marker,&quot; enabling the scientists to track thegene. The gene is of little economic importance in the U.S.,where bialaphos isn't used, though it's used in Europe,according to Thomas Rice, a DeKalb scientist.   The DeKalb research was carried out at laboratories inGroton, Conn., leased from Pfizer Inc. Earlier this year,DeKalb bought out Pfizer's 30% equity interest in what hadbeen a joint venture, DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics.   The USDA-Monsanto announcement said USDA scientists atlaboratories in Albany, Calif., had used a similar &quot;gene gun&quot;to fire new genes into corn-cell cultures developed atMonsanto's laboratories in St. Louis. The scientists insertedtwo &quot;marker&quot; genes into the corn cells: one gene that allowedthe cells to grow in the presence of an inhibitor; and asecond gene, taken from fireflies, that causes the cellsincorporating the gene to glow under a special low-lightdetector.   The cells that incorporated the two genes were grown tomature plants that were then pollinated. The resulting seedswere planted in a greenhouse where a crop of seedlings is nowgrowing. The light-detector has found that about half theseedlings have the firefly gene.   The feats are a major technological advance, butscientists cautioned it may be several years before farmerswill have genetically altered seed to plant. Not only mustscientists get the right genes into corn, but they have tomake sure the genetic alteration doesn't affect the yield andother valuable attributes of the plant. It will take severalseasons of field-testing to produce useful geneticallyengineered hybrid corn seed, Mr. Rice cautioned.</TEXT></DOC>
