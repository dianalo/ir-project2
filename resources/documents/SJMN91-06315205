By then, the man who for 25years had been a darling of the French left had swung dramatically to theright, as ready to denounce communism as to praise Ronald Reagan and MargaretThatcher.;   While he came to personify the quintessential French romantic,half-adventurer, half-intellectual, he was in fact born an Italian -- Ivo Liviby name -- at Monsummano Alto, Tuscany, on Oct. 13, 1921, just two yearsbefore the rise of fascism prompted his father to emigrate to France.;   Hewas brought up in a working-class family in Marseilles. He left school at age11 and worked in factories, bars and a hair salon while dreaming of a careerin entertainment.;   He performed for the first time on an amateur night in alocal theater when he was 17. By the time he was in his early 20s, he hadtaken the name Yves Montand and was singing in Paris.;   But the turning pointcame when he was spotted by Piaf. They fell in love and lived together for twoyears. In the meantime, she not only put his name up in lights but launchedhis movie career in 1946.;   They made several films together, but whenClouzot cast him in &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; in 1953, he became a star in his ownright.;   Soon afterward, he met and married Signoret. He continued toflourish as a singer, thanks to his skill in combining his smooth baritonevoice with appealingly poetic lyrics and light-footed dance routines. He alsomade one or more films every year.;   Such was his success on stage andtelevision that he was invited in 1960 to star in George Cukor's &quot;Let's MakeLove&quot; with Monroe.;   With Monroe's husband, Arthur Miller, and Signoret away,the two stars found themselves alone on location, and a torrid affair followed.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Paris  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911110  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  22A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  513  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 10, 199100315205,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
