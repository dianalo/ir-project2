(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Silver and turquoise jewelry adornAllyssa's tiny hands, and Indian images hang in the small houseacross from a shopping mall far from the red stone and open sky ofher Arizona reservation.   One of the rings is a gift from a Navajo elder at a recentpowwow that 11-month-old Allyssa visited with Rick and CherylPitts, who have been trying to adopt her since her birth.   The custody case has split the Navajo Nation. Many in the tribesympathized, but others vilified the Pittses and Allyssa's Navajomother, Patricia Keetso, who moved in with the couple when she waspregnant and still lives with them.   A tribal court granted the Pittses temporary custody of Allyssain April and is considering whether to grant permanentguardianship. A 1978 federal law gives tribal courts jurisdictionin adoption cases of Indian children as a way of preserving theheritage of the tribes.   ``I believe in the old traditional ways,'' the elder told thePittses. ``But seeing you, knowing how much you love that baby, youdeserve her.''   Oblivious of the legal tangle, Allyssa plays happily, a childwith two mothers and two cultures.   She has been blessed by a Navajo medicine man and a pastor ofthe Evangelical Free Church. Rather than the earthen-walled hogansand trailer homes that dot the hot, dry reservation, wood frame andstucco houses line the streets in the Pittses' busy San Joseneighborhood.   ``I think she'll have a better understanding of both worlds,''said Pitts, who with his wife agreed to take Allyssa back to thereservation frequently as she grows up and to have her learn Navajoways.   Keetso, 21 and unmarried, is working as a supermarket cashierbut has applied to join the Air Force and says she's eager to starta new life. The custody fight with her tribe, she says, has been``like an explosion in my face.''   Keetso, who has lived away from the reservation most of her lifeunder a Mormon Church education program, says tribal officials havecriticized her but many Navajos have been supportive.   She plans to see her daughter regularly, and Mrs. Pitts saysit's all right with her if Allyssa calls them both ``Mom.''   Keetso met the Pittses through an ad placed by adoptionattorneys in a Navajo newspaper. The ad read, ``Pregnant? We'rewilling to help you.'' Keetso wrote to the attorneys, saying shewanted to give her baby to a family that would provide a good homeand education off the reservation.   About a week later, the Pittses contacted the same attorneysabout their desire to adopt a baby after Mrs. Pitts had threemiscarriages trying to have a second child and then had ahysterectomy.   The birth and Keetso's immediate release of Allyssa to thePittses went smoothly, until the tribe intervened.   Following terms of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, theynotified the tribe that the adoption was pending in a non-IndianCalifornia court. In February, the tribe sought custody.   The Pittses feared they might have lost Allyssa forever whentribal officials took her away to Arizona in April. The couple hadgiven her up at the airport in San Jose on orders from a SuperiorCourt judge who ruled Indian courts had jurisdiction.   Allyssa cried as the officials walked away with her and kept herseparated from Mrs. Pitts and Keetso as they flew to Phoenix on thesame plane. From there, they expected to fly with Allyssa and theofficials to Flagstaff. Instead, the Navajos drove off to thestark, 14-million-acre reservation in northeastern Arizona, leavingMrs. Pitts and Keetso frantic about Allyssa's welfare.   ``I thought giving up the baby was hard, but when the tribeintervened that was the hardest, especially when they ran off withAllyssa,'' Keetso says. ``They said I brought shame on the Navajonation. But I am ashamed at how they mistreated her.''   When the Pittses and Keetso next saw Allyssa three days later,they say she was filthy and running a fever. Child-psychologistBarry Goodfield said she also was reacting in a way that reflectedstress and fear.   ``She'd always been a happy-go-lucky baby, and anybody couldhold her,'' Mrs. Pitts said. ``After they took her, she would onlyallow me to hold her for quite some time.''   She added, ``She's pretty much back to normal now,'' andGoodfield agreed.   Anslem Roanhorse, director of the Navajo Division of SocialWelfare, denied Allyssa was neglected or mistreated in her staywith Indian officials.   He said the baby was taken first to a hospital for an evaluationand to obtain medication for asthma, then was put in the care of anexperienced foster parent.   ``We know for a fact that she was not neglected,'' Roanhorsesaid.   The Pittses owe $13,000 in lawyers' fees. Pitts, an independentbuilding contractor, lost more than $10,000 in income whilefighting to keep Allyssa. Several Hollywood studios have showninterest in the story, but no deals have been signed.   In another month or so, perhaps by Allyssa's first birthday onJuly 20, the Pittses hope the tribal court will approve theirpermanent guardianship petition.   Even then, Pitts said, ``I don't think the experience we wentthrough, the emotions it stirred up, will ever be over.   ``We'll always be reminded of it because we're always going tocampaign against this law, as long as it's being enforced the wayit is, to help anyone else who falls into this unfortunatesituation.''   The Indian Child Welfare Act was part of an effort to stop theexodus of thousands of Indian children _ as many as 35 percent ofsome tribes' youngsters _ to non-Indian homes after their parents'rights were terminated by non-Indian courts.   Welfare agencies, using a non-Indian set of cultural values,often found fault with Indian child-rearing practices or assumedlife off the reservation would be better.   Roanhorse compared Indians to endangered species, saying theirfuture was threatened by the loss of children.   The Pittses and Keetso don't disagree with the reasons behindthe Indian Child Welfare Act. But they criticize the way Indianofficials handled their case.   ``I believe they were sincere in their concerns about theirheritage and culture, and we share their concerns,'' Pitts said.   ``It was our original arrangement with Patricia that she'd beable to see Allyssa all she wants and we'd take Allyssa out tovisit Patricia's family on the reservation,'' he said. ``That's thesame thing the tribal court said it wanted. If the Indian welfarepeople had bothered to ask before they went to court, they'd havespared all of us a lot of pain.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, June 20</NOTE></DOC>
