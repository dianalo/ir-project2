Of the 95patients in the study group, 80 underwent conventional angiography and15 underwent DSA. They analyzed the studies with regard to the type andamount of contrast agent used, the number of radiographs needed, andthe diagnostic quality of the images. Conventional angiography oftenrequires general anesthesia, magnification, and pharmaco-angiographictechniques to improve the image-based diagnosis. In comparison with conventionalangiography, intraarterial DSA is characterized by improved contrastsensitivity and inferior spatial resolution. However, DSA provides imagesas acceptable as those of conventional angiography. Smaller catheterscan be used, and the examination is performed under local anesthesia.The authors conclude that intraarterial DSA is now the technique of choicefor examining patients with chronic ischemia of the hand.</TEXT></DOC>
