This rule has also been reviewed with regard to the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Pursuant to this review,Ms. Anna Kondratas, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service,has certified that this proposed rule does not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.No new reporting and recordkeeping requirements are included in this proposedrule, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507) is therefore not required. This programis listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.559and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR Part3015, Subpart V, and final rule-related notice published at 48 FR 29114,June 24, 1983). <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The SFSP is authorized by section 13 of the National School Lunch Act (42U.S.C. 1761). Section 13(g) of that Act requires the Department to issueregulations for the program each fiscal year. Comprehensive program regulationswere last issued on February 16, 1982 (47 FR 6790). Since that time, annualreissuances and other amendments to the SFSP regulations have incorporatedcertain provisions mandated by law and other discretionary changes intendedto clarify program requirements or improve program management. This year's reissuances of the SFSP regulations, which will govern programoperations in 1989, includes a complete reorganization of 7 CFR Part 225.This reorganization is being undertaken in order to resolve any ambiguitiesor inconsistencies in the regulations; eliminate unnecessary, duplicative,and obsolete provisions; and clarify the regulations' language, style,and organization so that Part 225 is more easily understood. In addition,the Department is proposing to change the definition of ``sponsor'' toconform to the terms of Pub. L. 100-435, the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988.Finally, the Department is also proposing several discretionary changesinvolving food service management companies, weekend meal service, letterof credit procedures, overclaims against sponsors, administrative fundingreviews, and other aspects of the regulations. These changes are intendedto improve program accountability and management. I. Reorganization of Part 225 The proposed reorganization will result in a reduction in the number ofsubparts in the Part 225 regulations from five to four, and a reductionin the number of sections from twenty-four to twenty. Subpart B of thecurrent regulations (``Assistance to States'') has been eliminated andthe information contained therein now appears in the revised subpart onState agency provisions. Both Subparts B and C (``State Agency Provisions''and ``Sponsor and Site Provisions'') have been substantially re-organizedwith two primary goals in mind: (1) To organize the regulations in a roughlychronological order corresponding to the annual cycle of activities undertakenby the Department, State agencies, and sponsors in the SFSP; and (2) topresent the information in the regulations in a more logical fashion, bringingtogether all information on the same topic in the same section of the regulations.As an example of the first type of change, the section dealing with theState agency's management and administration plan (MAP) is now the firstsection in Subpart B. This change has been made because submission andapproval of the MAP is the prerequisite to all other steps (e.g., establishmentof a letter of credit from program payments, giving public notice of theProgram's availability, etc.) which occur in each State agency's annualcycle of SFSP activities. As an example of the second type of change, revisedandSection;225.6(a), which sets forth the general responsibilities of Stateagencies, now includes information which previously appeared in three differentsections of the regulations.It is, of course, impossible to describe in this preamble all of the organizationalchanges made in this proposed rulemaking. Therefore, a redesignation tablehas been included at the end of this preamble which lists both the currentand revised location of each paragraph in Part 225. This table should providereaders with a convenient overview of the reorganization and enable themto more easily locate specific parts of the old and new regulations. Accordingly, the Department proposes to revise and reorganize Part 225.II. Mandatory Change to Part 225 Section 213 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-435) mandateda change in the definition of those organizations eligible to apply forSFSP sponsorship. Since passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1981 (Pub. L. 97-35), private nonprofit organizations have not beenallowed to sponsor the SFSP unless they were residential camps or schoolfood authorities. Section 213 of the Hunger Prevention Act allows privatenonprofit colleges and universities to participate in the SFSP <T3>provided that </T3>they are currently participating in the NationalYouth Sports Program (NYSP) and meet the other requirements for Programsponsorship. Section 213 of Pub. L. 100-435 also mandated that the Department conducta pilot project to assess the feasibility of again allowing other typesof private nonprofit organizations to sponsor the SFSP. The Departmentis currently preparing to conduct the pilot project mandated by the HungerPrevention Act. Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend andSection;225.2 and currentandSection;225.18(a) [redesignated andSection;225.14(b)] to allow private collegesand universities participating in the NYSP to be SFSP sponsors. III. Substantive Changes to Part 225 <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Food Service Management Companies </ITAG>During the past two years, the Department has received numerous requestsfor clarification of several aspects of the Part 225 regulations pertainingto food service management companies (FSMCs). The questions which havebeen raised involve: The differences between ``vended'' and ``self-preparation''sponsors, especially in regard to the added administrative reimbursementearned by self-preparation sponsors; the definition of an FSMC; the practicalapplication of the regulatory prohibition on contracting out for the managementresponsibilities of the program; whether colleges and universities withyear-round FSMC contracts are required to conduct new procurements fortheir SFSP meal service; whether colleges and universities acting as FSMCsare exempt from registration requirements; and the form of the bid andperformance bonds submitted by FSMCs. Although many of these questionsoverlap to some extent, the following explanation of regulatory intentattempts to address each topic separately. <T3>1. Self-preparation sponsors and payment of the higher administrativereimbursement. </T3>It has recently come to the Department's attentionthat there is a lack of consistency among administering agencies in determiningwhen a sponsor is considered to be ``self-preparation'' and, therefore,eligible to receive a higher rate of administrative reimbursement. Theadministrative differential was established as a result of section 13(b)(4)of the National School Lunch Act (NSLA). That section of the law requiredthe Department to determine whether some SFSP sponsors incurred higheradministrative costs. The Department determined that rural and self-preparationsponsors incur higher costs related to planning, organizing, and managingtheir SFSP food service and that these sponsors should receive a higherper meal rate of administrative reimbursement. In Fiscal Year 1988, theadministrative rate differential amounted to 1.75 cents per breakfast,2.75 cents per lunch or supper, and 1 cent per supplement served.Inconsistencies in interpretation have arisen as a result of the wide rangeof food service options being employed by SFSP sponsors. While some sponsorsprepare their meals ``from scratch'' on a daily basis and should clearlybe considered ``self-preparation'' sponsors, other food service arrangementsare more complex and difficult to categorize. Some sponsors, for example,purchase pre-made components of their SFSP meals (e.g., sandwiches) froma food vendor or from an FSMC registered in that State, therefore incurringfar lower meal preparation costs than sponsors which prepare all of theirmeals ``from scratch''. Other sponsors utilize FSMC staff to run theirfood service operation (often these are schools contracting on a year-roundbasis for management of all the Child Nutrition Programs) while retainingtheir own staff to actually prepare SFSP meals. Other sponsors might contractfor <T3>all</T3> the personnel necessary to prepare meals, but continue tohave the meals prepared in the sponsor's kitchens. Finally, there are thosesponsors which contract with a management company to run the program andhave meals delivered to SFSP sites from the FSMC's own food preparationfacilities. While the latter are clearly ``vended sponsors'', the otherarrangements_purchasing a particular meal component, management services,or labor from a registered FSMC or from a food vendor_have proven far moredifficult to define as clearly ``self-preparation'' or ``vended''.The current definitions of ``self-preparation'' and ``food service managementcompany'' have not served to adequately clarify the distinction between``self-preparation'' and ``vended'' sponsors. Some State agencies believethat a sponsor should be considered ``vended'' as soon as it purchasesany food from a company registered in the State as an FSMC. Proponentsof this view base their conclusion on the current definition of ``self-preparation'',which states that the sponsor which contracts with an FSMC ``for the preparationof all or a portion of the meals'' is not a self-preparation sponsor. However,other State agencies believe that, as long as the sponsor has contractedfor a component and not for the preparation of the total meal (i.e., forall of the components of the unitized meal, with or without milk), it hasnot contracted with a FSMC, regardless of whether the company is registeredto serve as an FSMC to other sponsors in the State. These State agenciestherefore believe that the sponsor contracting for meal components, butnot the entire meal, may still be considered to be a self-preparation sponsor.Much of the confusion surrounding this issue can be resolved by consultingthe definitions of ``operating costs'' and ``administrative costs'' atandSection; 225.2 of the regulations. The former definition states that operatingcosts include the ``(i) cost of obtaining food, (ii) labor directly involvedin the preparation and service of food, (iii) cost of nonfood supplies,(iv) rental and use allowances for equipment and space, and (v) costs fortransporting children in rural areas to feeding sites in rural areas. ** * *'' ``Administrative costs'', on the other hand, are ``costs incurredby a sponsor related to planning, organizing, and managing a food serviceunder the Program. * * * *'' Given these definitions, it is clear thatthe regulations contemplate no difference in <T3>administrative</T3> costs between a sponsor preparing its meals fromscratch and a sponsor purchasing a pre-made meal component (but not theentire meal, with or without milk) from a commercial food vendor. Althoughthese two sponsors would likely incur different <T3>operating</T3> costs (due to the difference in the amount of laboreach sponsor uses to prepare its meals), their administrative costs of``planning, organizing, and managing'' the meal service could, in theory,be identical. Both sponsors would still be responsible for all of the administrativerequirements of running the Program's food service operations, includingsetting up delivery routes, procuring meals, hiring and supervising labor,setting up the meal production line, adjusting meal orders, and monitoringsite deliveries. Thus, both the sponsor which prepares its meals ``fromscratch'' and the sponsor which purchases a pre-packaged or pre-made componentfrom a company registered in the State as an FSMC or from another foodvendor should be considered ``self-preparation''. Both are therefore eligibleto receive the higher rate of administrative reimbursement.However, both the sponsor which hires an FSMC to prepare some or all ofits <T3>unitized meals</T3> (i.e., the total meal, with or without milk) andthe sponsor which hires the FSMC to manage its food service operationshave clearly lowered the cost of ``planning, organizing, and managing''their food service operation. As soon as an FSMC begins to manage any portionof the sponsor's food service operation_regardless of whether this involvesthe management of some or all of the unitized meal preparation or the managementof the sponsor's entire food service operations_it has lessened the sponsor'sadministrative responsibilities and has undercut the rationale for paymentof the higher administrative rate. Therefore, sponsors which contract witha company registered in that State as an FSMC for a pre-made component(but not the total meal, with or without milk) may still be consideredself-preparation, whereas sponsors which contract with an FSMC for managementservices or for the preparation of some or all of their unitized mealsmust always be considered ``vended'' sponsors.Accordingly, in order to clarify this distinction in the regulations, theDepartment proposes to amend the definitions of ``self-preparation sponsor''and ``food service management company'' and to add a definition of ``vendedsponsor'' at andSection; 225.2.<T3>2. Prohibition on contracting out management responsibilities.</T3>The current definition of a food service management company at andSection;225.2 states that an FSMC is an entity which ``contracts with a sponsorto manage any aspect of the food service program''. At the same time, currentandSection; 225.16(b) [redesignated andSection; 225.15(a)(3)] prohibits sponsorsfrom ``contract[ing] out for the management responsibilities of the Programsuch as monitoring, enforcing corrective action, or preparing Program applications.''Some State agencies believe that defining an FSMC as an entity which may``manage any aspect of the food service program'' conflicts with the regulatoryprohibition on contracting out the management responsibilities of the Program.The key words in the current definition of FSMC, however, are ``food service''.These words are intended to limit the FSMC's functions to purchasing food,assembling meals, delivering Program meals, or supervising these functionsfor the sponsor. The other ``management responsibilities'' of the Programintrinsically belong to the sponsor and cannot be delegated to a contractoror any other person. The Department believes that part of the confusionsurrounding this distinction results from the use of the word ``program''after ``food service'' in the definition of FSMC. Many people have confusedthe ``food service program'' with the Summer Food Service Program, whichexpands the potential management duties of the FSMC far beyond what wasintended in the regulations. In addition, the enumeration of only threeprohibited management functions at current andSection; 225.16(b) has ledsome administering agencies to believe that any other management functions<T3>may</T3> be performed by the FSMC.Accordingly, the Department proposes to change the word ``program'' to``Operations'' in the definition of FSMC at andSection; 225.2 and to describemore completely the management functions which FSMCs <T3>may not</T3> perform at redesignated andSection; 225.15.<T3>3. Food service management company procurements. </T3>Section 225.16(c)of the current regulations [redesignated andSection; 225.6(g)(9)] exemptstwo types of FSMCs from the annual requirement to register with the Stateagency in order to participate in the Program: schools or school food authoritieswhich act as an FSMC; and FSMCs which have ``an exclusive contract witha school or school food authority for year-round service (and no contractswith other sponsors) * * * *'' In addition, andSection; 225.16(d) of thecurrent regulations [redesignated andSection; 225.15(g)(5)] states that schoolsponsors with year-round FSMC contracts are not required to comply withthe bid procedures mandated in that paragraph. These two provisions ofthe regulations have generated some confusion regarding: the applicabilityof the competitive procurement requirements set forth at andSection; 225.17to year-round contracts between school sponsors and FSMCs; whether collegesor universities with year-round FSMC contracts are also exempt from thebid procedures specified at current andSection; 225.16(d); and whether collegesand universities acting as FSMCs are considered to be ``schools'' and,therefore, exempt from the registration requirements set forth at currentandSection; 225.16(c). The language of current andSection; 225.16(d) is intended to allow schoolfood authority sponsors with exclusive year-round FSMC contracts to utilizethose contractual arrangements for the SFSP without having to conduct aseparate procurement for SFSP meal service. The provision does not ``exempt''them from following the competitive procurement requirements set forthin andSection; 225.17 and 7 CFR Part 3015 (the Department's Uniform FederalAssistance Regulations). Rather, SFSP school sponsors with year-round contractshave already utilized competitive procurement procedures in obtaining theFSMC's services for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). SFSP sponsors which are colleges or universities often enter into exclusiveyear-round contracts with an FSMC, just as SFSP school sponsors do priorto the beginning of the fall semester. However, public universities currentlyparticipate in the SFSP as units of State government, and private nonprofitcolleges or universities participating in the NYSP will be eligible toparticipate in the 1989 SFSP as an entirely new category of sponsor. Thus,neither type of sponsor participates in the SFSP as a school sponsor andneither is exempt from the bid procedures set forth at current andSection;225.16(d), since this exemption is limited to SFSP ``sponsors which areschools or school food authorities [and] which have an exclusive contractwith food service management companies for year-round service * * *.''It may, however, be unreasonable to require college and university sponsorsto conduct a separate SFSP procurement as opposed to utilizing their year-roundFSMC contractor to provide Program meals. The logic which underlies theexemption for school sponsors_that they have already followed the competitiveprocurement requirements in entering into their year-round FSMC contract_mayalso be valid for the public and private colleges and universities whichare eligible to participate in the SFSP. As entities of State government,public universities and colleges are subject to their own State's procurementrequirements, many of which are more stringent than the procurement requirementsmandated in Program and Departmental regulations. Similarly, private collegesand universities participating in the NYSP are generally subject to Stateor Federal procurement requirements as well. Thus, the Department is confidentthat colleges and universities eligible to participate in the SFSP arealready required to follow competitive procurement requirements in obtainingtheir year-round FSMC contracts, just as school sponsors are under theNSLP. Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend the definition of ``schoolfood authority'' in a way which will, given the wording of current andSection;225.16(d) [redesignated andSection; 225.15(g)(5)], allow colleges and universitiesto be exempt from conducting a separate FSMC procurement for the SFSP ifthey already have a competitive procured year-round contract with an FSMC.This change will also exempt colleges or universities acting as food servicemanagement companies from the registration requirements at current andSection;225.16(c) [redesignated andSection; 225.6(g)(9)]. <T3>4. Performance and bid bonds. </T3>Over the past several years, theDepartment has received repeated questions regarding the permissibilityof ``alternatives'' to the bid and performance bonds required of FSMCsat current andSection; 225.16 (j) and (k) of the regulations. Proposed alternativesto obtaining a bond from a company listed in Treasury Circular 570 haveincluded certified checks, cash, escrow accounts, or letters of creditin an amount equal to or greater than the amount which the company wouldspend to obtain the bid for performance bond. None of these alternatives to obtaining bid or performance bonds is permissibleunder the SFSP regulations. Unlike other bonding situations, the Departmentdoes not require FSMCs to obtain bid or performance bonds solely to providea cash recourse in the event of default. Rather, the Department's primarypurpose in requiring FSMCs to secure bonds is to obtain a third-party reviewof the company's ability to provide the required number of meals for thelife of the contract. It does the Department and the sponsor little goodto hold cash in the amount of 10 percent of the contract's value if theFSMC decides not to fulfill its contract the day before Program meal serviceis to begin, or decides to stop performing half-way through the SFSP. Itwould likely be very difficult for the sponsor to find another contractorable and willing to provide the required number of meals on such shortnotice. Thus, if the FSMC's intention and ability to provide the requiredmeal service is subject to a third-party review, it minimizes the likelihoodof the type of default which would render it virtually impossible for thesponsor to provide meals to the children entitled to Program benefits.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend current andSection; 225.16(1)[redesignated andSection; 225.15(g)(8)] to clarify that there are no acceptablealternatives to the required submission of bid and performance bonds byan FSMC.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Weekend Meals </ITAG>Currently, the Part 225 regulations do not specifically address the subjectof whether sponsors may serve reimbursable Program meals on the weekend.While it is logical to expect that residential camp sponsors would haveweekend meal service, it has recently come to the Department's attentionthat a small but increasing number of non-camp sponsors are serving Programmeals on the weekends. Where this occurs, State agencies are often reluctanteither to approve or disapprove such service because of the absence ofexplicit guidance on this issue in the regulations. Section 13(a)(1) of the NSLA authorizes participation in the SFSP by sponsorswhich ``develop special summer or school vacation programs providing foodservice similar to that made available to children during the school yearunder the school lunch * * * or the school breakfast program * * *.'' Theprimary purpose of the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programsis to provide nutritious meals to children in schools. Schools normallyoperate on a Monday through Friday schedule. Although children in residentialchild care institutions which participate in the School Lunch or BreakfastPrograms may receive reimbursable meals on the weekends, such weekend mealservice is the rare exception in the School Programs. Consistent with thisfact, it is not appropriate to provide reimbursement for weekend mealsin the SFSP unless those meals are served in residential camp settings.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend current andSection; 225.20(a)[redesignated andSection; 225.16(c)] to clarify that Program reimbursementmay not be claimed for meals served at non-camp sites on the weekend.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Overclaims for Inadequate Recordkeeping</ITAG>Section 13(m) of the NSLA requires State agencies and sponsors participatingin the Program to ``keep such accounts and records as may be necessaryto enable the Secretary to determine whether there has been compliancewith this section and the regulations issued hereunder.'' The regulationsat current andSection;andSection;225.10(a) and 225.19(f) [redesignated andSection;andSection;225.8(a)and 225.15(c)(1)] require State agencies and sponsors, respectively, tokeep records which document the basis of the reimbursement they have claimedunder the Program. Moreover, current andSection;225.8(b)(13) [redesignatedandSection;225.6(e)(13)] requires the State-sponsor agreement to includea provision that sponsors agree to retain Program records for a periodof three years and to make such records available to State and Federalreviewers and auditors as necessary. In addition, current andSection;225.13(c)(4)(ii)[redesignated andSection;225.11(c)(4)(ii)] underscores the importance ofthe Program recordkeeping requirements by defining failure to maintainadequate records at a significant proportion of its sites as grounds forterminating the sponsor's participation in the Program.On numerous occasions, the Department and State agencies have used theauthority implied in these regulatory provisions to recover funds paidto sponsors which did not have records sufficient to support all or a portionof their claims for reimbursement. Recently, however, this authority hasbeen implicitly challenged in two separate court ruling's pertaining tothe Department's Child Care Food Program (CCFP). In both cases, the assessmentof overclaims against CCFP sponsors on the basis of missing or inadequaterecords was overturned on the grounds that the CCFP regulations do notspecifically authorize overclaims for these reasons.The Department firmly believes that proper and efficient administrationof the Program depends on the integrity of the claims submitted by sponsors.This integrity cannot be fully ensured unless the Department and Stateagencies are capable of assessing overclaims when records are not availableto document the accuracy of the claim. Such authority is vital if the Departmentis to meet its responsibility to deter Program fraud and abuse. Withoutproper records, it is impossible to determine whether children were fedmeals in accordance with basic Program requirements and whether Programfunds were expended in the manner envisioned by the law and the regulations.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend current andSection;andSection;225.11(c)(4),225.14(a) and 225.19(f) [redesignated andSection;andSection; 225.9(d)(4), 225.12(a)and 225.15(c)(1)] to clarify that failure to adhere to Program recordkeepingrequirements constitutes sufficient cause to assess overclaims againsta sponsor.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Letter of Credit for Program Payments</ITAG>Based on a State agency's approved Management and Administration Plan (MAP),current andSection;225.4(a)(2) [redesignated andSection;225.5(d)(2)] requiresthe Department to ensure that the State agency has at least 65 percentof its estimated Program payment needs available in its letter of credit(LOC) by May 15. Current andSection;225.6(a) [redesignated andSection;225.4(a)]requires State agencies to submit their MAPs to FNS Regional Offices nolater than February 15 of each year. Thus, FNS should have 90 days to review,ask for modification of, and approve the MAP between the time the MAP issubmitted and the time by which the State agency must have 65 percent ofits estimated Program payment needs in the LOC.However, current andSection;225.6(b) [redesignated andSection;225.4(b)] allowsState agencies to submit their MAPs after the February 15 deadline anddoes not specify a final deadline by which the State agency must submitthe MAP. At the same time, no leeway is allowed in the date by which FNSmust ensure that 65 percent of the State agency's Program payment needs,as estimated in its approved MAP, are in the LOC. Thus, regardless of whenthe State agency submits its MAP, it is guaranteed to have 65 percent ofits estimated Program payment needs in the LOC by May 15 of each year.The Department is concerned that the MAP submission and approval processwill become a mere paperwork exercise if sufficient time is not allowedfor FNS to review and approve the State agencies' MAPs. It is thereforenecessary to provide FNS with adeqate time to review and approve the MAPsin those cases where the State agency submits its MAP after the February15 deadline specified at current andSection;225.6(a) and section 13(n) ofthe NSLA.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend current andSection;225.4(a)(2)[redesignated andSection;225.5(d)(2)] to provide FNS with additional timefor ensuring the 65 percent level of LOC funding when State agencies submitMAPs after the February 15 deadline.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. MAP Requirements</ITAG>The regulations at current andSection;225.6(d) [redesignated andSection;225.4(d)]specify twelve items or topics which must be addressed in each State agency'sMAP. This list of MAP requirements is based on section 13(n) of the NSLAwhich establishes the minimum requirements for the content of the Stateagency's MAP. However, section 13(n) of the law also provides the Secretaryof Agriculture with the authority to impose additional MAP requirementsas necessary.Over the past several years, it has come to the Department's attentionthat some State agencies are not performing a number of the special monitoringfunctions relating to sponsors' food service management company (FSMC)procurements which are required by current andSection;225.16 of the SFSPregulations. Specifically, some State agencies have failed to: have a representativepresent at all FSMC bid openings where the contract is expected to exceed$100,000 in value; review and approve prior to execution all proposed contractswhich exceed $100,000 in value; and review and approve prior to executionall proposed contracts based on a bid other than the the lowest bid received.The failure to consistently perform these special monitoring functionshas resulted in a number of procurements which have not met Program requirementsthat all procurements be conducted in a manner which ensures free and opencompetition.The Department recognizes that these special FSMC monitoring responsibilitiesplace high demands on the limited resources which many State agencies haveavailable to perform SFSP monitoring functions. The Department stronglybelieves, however, that the performance of these special FSMC procurementmonitoring responsibilities is critically important to ensuring the integrityof Program operations and the accountability of Program funds. To facilitatethe efficient performance of these responsibilities, it is imperative thatState agencies carefully plan and budget for attending bid openings andreviewing and approving funding for those proposed FSMC contracts specifiedat current andSection;225.16(d)(7) [redesignated andSection;225.15(g)(5)(xiii)].Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend current andSection;225.6(d)[redesignated andSection;225.4(d)] by adding a requirement that the Stateagency's MAP include its plans for performing the special FSMC procurementmonitoring functions specified at current andSection;andSection;225.16(d)(7)and (g) [redesignated andSection;andSection;225.15(g)(5)(xiii) and 225.6(h)(4),respectively].<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Health Inspection Funds</ITAG>The current SFSP regulations at andSection;225.4(k) [redesignated andSection;225.5(f)]require FNS to make available by LOC an amount equal to one percent ofthe previous year's Program expenditures in that State. This one percentfund is earmarked for the conduct of health inspections and meal qualitytests required by the regulations. Many State agencies, however, are ableto obtain health and meal quality inspections without cost, usually byentering into an interagency agreement with State or local health departments.In some cases, the money for health inspections is set aside in the LOCbut is never used. It is than returned to FNS after the conclusion of Programoperations.The Department believes that it is wasteful and inefficient to set asideand return money from an LOC which State agencies have no intention ofusing. For those State agencies which have been receiving health and mealquality inspections without cost, it should be relatively simple to obtaina commitment which extends these arrangements early in the fiscal year.This would eliminate the need to establish a special LOC for the performanceof these inspections in States capable of obtaining these services withoutcost to the Program. Thus, by the February 15 deadline for receipt of MAPs,all State agencies should have had ample time to determine whether or notthey will need FNS funding for the conduct of health inspections and mealquality tests during the current fiscal year.Accordingly, the Department is amending current andSection;andSection;225.4(k)and 225.6(d) [redesignated andSection;andSection;225.5(f) and 225.4(d)] toprovide that FNS will not establish a one percent LOC for the performanceof health and meal quality inspections unless the State agency's MAP demonstratesthat these inspections cannot be performed without cost to the Program.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Administrative Funding Reviews</ITAG>Current andSection; 225.12(c) [redesignated andSection; 225.5(c)] states inpart that, ``FNSRO shall collect data on the need for Program and Stateadministrative funding within any State agency if the funding needs estimatedin a State's management and administration plan are no longer accurate.''Although the provision for these reviews has been located at andSection;225.12 (``Audit and management evaluation'') of the regulations, the Departmentis proposing to move the provision since the administrative funding reviewsdirectly affect the letters of credit discussed at current andSection; 225.4[redesignated andSection; 225.5], ``Payments to State agencies and use ofProgram funds''.In addition to relocating this paragraph, the Department also proposesto correct several errors pertaining to these reviews at current andSection;225.4. It is clear, for example, that administrative funding reviews arenot required by the regulations <T3>unless </T3>a State's MAP is determined to be inaccurate. Nevertheless,current andSection;andSection; 225.4(a)(3), 225.4(g)(3) and 225.4(k) [redesignatedandSection;andSection; 225.5(d)(3), (b)(3) and (f), respectively] either implyor state that such reviews are <T3>required </T3>under any circumstances. Thus, the revised regulationsstate that adjustments to the letters of credit for State administrativefunds, Program payments, and health inspection funds <T3>may </T3>be based on this administrative funding assessment if oneis conducted, but that such adjustments may also be based on other dataor other reasons if an administrative funding assessment is not conducted.Finally, the Department is proposing several substantive changes relatedto the date by which an administrative funding assessment is conductedand the timeframes for adjusting letters of credit based on the resultsof the assessment. Current andSection; 225.12(c) states that these assessmentsare to be conducted ``during the period of Program operations, but notlater than August 20.'' However, current andSection; 225.4 establishes otherdeadlines which conflict with this August 20 date. Current andSection; 225.4(a)(3),for example, requires that FNS make an adjustment to the letter of creditfor Program payments based on the administrative funding assessment <T3>no later than July 1. </T3>This deadline is impractical, given thatthe inadequacy of a State's MAP estimates might not be evident until wellafter July 1, triggering the conduct of an administrative funding assessmentat this later date. Similarly, current andSection; 225.4(g)(3) requires thatan adjustment of the State administrative funds letter of credit be made``as soon as practicable'' after the conduct of the funding assessment,but not later than September 1. Current andSection; 225.12(c), however, requiresthat adjustments to State administrative funds based on the administrativefunding assessment be made ``immediately''.In order to remedy these inconsistencies, the Department proposes to allowthe assessments to be conducted ``during the period of Program operations'';to require that adjustments based on these assessments be made ``as soonas possible'' rather than ``immediately''; and to provide that the adjustmentsmade to the letters of credit for both program and administrative fundsbe made no later than September 1.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. Definition of ``Special Account''</ITAG>The Department believes that the current definition of ``special account''at andSection; 225.2 of the regulations is in need of revision. That definitionstates in part that a special account is ``an account between a sponsorand a food service management company with a State or federally insuredbank * * *.'' The prepositional phrases ``between a sponsor and a foodservice management company'' and ``with a State or federally insured bank''leave ambiguous the nature of such accounts. In addition, the definitionat andSection; 225.2 states that the accounts hold operating cost paymentswhich may be ``released only in accordance with the terms of the specialaccount agreement.'' This, too, leaves unclear the exact method by whichfunds are authorized for release from the account.Therefore, those wishing to understand how a special account is establishedand how funds are released from the account cannot do so by referring tothe definition at andSection; 225.2. They must refer, instead, to the descriptionof such accounts at current andSection; 225.8(e) [redesignated andSection;225.6(f)], which states that: ``[T]he State agency may require any sponsorwhich contracts with a food service management company to enter into anagreement with the State agency to provide that the sponsor shall establisha special account with a State agency or Federally insured bank for operatingcosts payable to the sponsor by the State.'' Thus, the definition at andSection;225.2 would be clearer if it specified that special accounts are accountswhich the State agency sometimes requires vended sponsors to establishwith the State agency itself or with a Federally insured bank. In addition,current andSection; 225.8(e) specifies that, ``any disbursement of moniesfrom the account must be authorized by both the sponsor and the food servicemanagement company.'' This information, too, should be included in thedefinition at andSection; 225.2.Accordingly, the Department proposes to revise andSection; 225.2 to moreclearly define the nature and operation of a special account in the SFSP.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Deletion of Statistical Monitoring for Site Reviews</ITAG>Current andSection; 225.9(e)(8) of the regulations permit State agenciesto use ``statistical monitoring procedures in lieu of the site monitoringrequirements prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section * * *.'' Theintent of this provision was to reduce the regulatory burden imposed onState agencies for performing such site reviews. However, to the best ofthe Department's knowledge, no State agency is currently using ``statisticalmonitoring techniques'' to meet the site monitoring requirements set forthat andSection; 225.9(e)(2) [redesignated andSection; 225.7(d)(2)].This may be due to concern that, if reviews based on these techniques areused to establish overclaims, their findings may not be upheld on appeal.In addition, current FNS guidance on statistical monitoring is badly outof date, and would need to be revised before any State agency used statisticalmonitoring techniques. Given the apparent lack of State agency interestin exploring such techniques, the Department does not believe that it wouldbe appropriate to devote the resources necessary to make such revisions.Accordingly, the statistical monitoring option for the performance of sitereviews at current andSection; 225.9(e)(8) of the regulations has been deletedfrom this proposed regulation.<ITAG tagnum="81">J. Media Release for Camps and other Enrolled Sites</ITAG>Current andSection; 225.21(c) [redesignated andSection; 225.15(e)] requirescamps and other enrolled sites to issue media releases which announce theavailability of free Program meals to all eligible children. In addition,current andSection; 225.21 requires these releases to ``include the Secretary'sfamily-size and income standards for free and reduced-price meals'' andto ``state that meals are available without regard to race, color, nationalorigin, sex, age, or handicap.''In contrast, the applications which camps and enrolled sites distributeto the parents and guardians of enrolled children must, in accordance withsection 9(b)(2)(B) of the Act and current andSection; 225.21(d) [redesignatedandSection; 225.15(f)] of the regulations, list only the family size andincome levels for reduced price eligibility ``with an explanation thathouseholds with incomes less than or equal to these values would be eligiblefor free SFSP meals.'' This restriction is due to the fact that there isno ``reduced price'' meal eligibility, <T3>per se, </T3>in the SFSP. Rather, reduced price eligibility standardsare used to document eligibility for free SFSP meals. Thus, the Departmentbelieves that, like the application, the media release issued by campsand other enrolled sites should also list <T3>only </T3>the family size and income standards for reduced price meals.To list two sets of income standards (free and reduced price) in the mediarelease only increases the potential confusion of Program applicants whomight not understand that they would only need to meet the reduced priceeligibility standards in order to receive free meals.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend current andSection; 225.21(c)[redesignated andSection; 225.15(e)] by requiring that the media releaseissued by camps and other enrolled sites list only the Secretary's guidelinesfor reduced price eligibility and that these guidelines be labelled ``SummerFood Service Program Eligibility Standards''. In addition, the Departmentalso proposes to make a related amendment to the definition of ``documentation''at andSection; 225.2, removing the phrase ``free and reduced price application''and substituting in its place the words ``free meal application''.<ITAG tagnum="81">K. Record Retention by Food Service Management Companies</ITAG>Current regulations at andSection;andSection; 225.8(b)(13), 225.10(a) and 225.16(e)(5)[redesignated andSection;andSection; 225.6(e)(13), 225.8(a) and 225.6(h)(2)(vii),respectively] set forth the record retention requirements for sponsors,State agencies, and food service management companies. All entities arerequired to retain their Program records for three years. In addition,current andSection;andSection; 225.8(b)(13) and 225.10(a) require sponsorsand State agencies to retain Program records for longer than three yearsif there are unresolved audit or investigative findings at the end of thethree-year period. However, current andSection; 225.16(e)(5) inadvertentlyfails to mention that food service management companies are also requiredto retain their Program records for longer than three years if there areunresolved audit or investigative findings pertaining to the company orto a sponsor with which the management company contracted.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend andSection; 225.16(e)(5) [redesignatedandSection; 225.6(h)(2)(vii)] to clarify that food service management companiesare also required to retain their Program records for more than three yearswhen there are unresolved audit or investigative findings pertaining tothe company or to a sponsor with which the company contracted.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 225</ITAG>Food assistance

If emergency conditions preventa sponsor normally having a supply of milk from temporarily obtaining milkdeliveries, the State agency may approve the service of breakfasts, lunchesor suppers without milk during the emergency period. (7) <T3>Continuing unavailability of milk</T3>. The inability of a sponsorto obtain a supply of milk on a continuing basis shall not bar it fromparticipation in the Program. In such cases, the State agency may approveservice of meals without milk, provided that an equivalent amount of canned,whole dry or nonfat dry milk is used in the preparation of the milk componentsset forth in paragraph (d) of this section. In addition, the State agencymay approve the use of nonfat dry milk in meals served to children participatingin activities which make the service of fluid milk impracticable, and inlocations which are unable to obtain fluid milk. Such authorization shallstipulate that nonfat dry milk be reconstituted at normal dilution andunder sanitary conditions consistent with State and local health regulations.(8) <T3>Additional foods</T3>.

Schools, institutions, and service institutions may use a vegetableprotein product, defined in paragraph 2, as a food component meeting themeal requirements specified in andSection;andSection; 210.10, 225.16 or 226.20under the following terms and conditions: (a) The vegetable protein product must be prepared in combination withraw or cooked meat, poultry or seafood and shall resemble, as well as substitutein part for, one of these major protein foods. ``Substitute'' refers toa vegetable protein product whose presence in another food results in thepresence of a smaller amount of meat, poultry or seafood than is customarilyexpected or than appears to be present in that food. Examples of itemsin which a vegetable protein product may be used include, but are not limitedto, beef patties, beef crumbles, pizza topping, meat loaf, meat sauce,taco filling, burritos, and tuna salad. (b) Vegetable protein products may be used in the dry form (nonhydrated),partially hydrated or fully hydrated form in combination with meat, poultryor seafood. The moisture content of the fully hydrated vegetable proteinproduct shall be such that the mixture will have a minimum of 18 percentprotein by weight or equivalent amount for the dry or partially hydratedform (based on the level that would be provided if the product were fullyhydrated). (c) The quantity, by weight, of the fully hydrated vegetable protein productmust not exceed 30 parts to 70 parts meat, poultry or seafood on an uncookedbasis. The quantity by weight of the dry or partially hydrated vegetableprotein product must not exceed a level equivalent to the amount (dry weight)used in the fully hydrated product at the 30 percent level of substitution.The dry or partially hydrated product's replacement of meat, poultry orseafood will be based on the level of substitution it would provide ifit were fully hydrated. (d) A vegetable protein product may be used to satisfy the meat/meat alternaterequirement when combined with meat, poultry or seafood and when it meetsthe other requirements of this section. The combination of the vegetableprotein product and meat, poultry or seafood may meet all or part of themeat/meat alternate requirement specified in andSection;andSection; 210.10,225.16 or 226.20. (e) The contribution vegetable protein products make toward the meat/meatalternate requirement specified in andSection;andSection; 210.10, 225.16, and226.20 shall be determined on the basis of the preparation yield of themeat, poultry or seafood with which it is combined. When computing thepreparation yield of a product containing meat, poultry or seafood andvegetable protein product, the vegetable protein product shall be evaluatedas having the same preparation yield that is applied to the meat, poultryor seafood it replaces. (f) When vegetable protein products are served in a meal with other alternatefood authorized in Appendix A, each individual alternate food shall beused as specifically directed. 2. A vegetable protein product to be used to resemble, and substitute inpart for, meat, poultry or seafood, as specified in paragraph 1, must meetthe following criteria: (a) The vegetable protein product (substitute food) shall contain one ormore vegetable protein products which are defined as follows: (1) Vegetable (plant) protein products are foods which are processed sothat some portion of the nonprotein constituents of the vegetable is removed.These vegetable protein products are safe and suitable edible productsproduced from vegetable (plant) sources including, but not limited to,soybeans, peanuts, wheat, and corn.(b) The types of vegetable protein products described in paragraph 2(a)(1)of this appendix shall include flour, concentrate, and isolate as definedbelow:(1) When a product contains less than 65 percent protein by weight calculatedon a moisture-free basis excluding added flavors, colors, or other addedsubstances it is a ``<T2>XX</T2> flour'', the blank to be filled with the name of the sourceof the protein, e.g., ``soy'' or ``peanut''.(2) When a product contains 65 percent or more but less than 90 percentprotein by weight calculated on a moisture-free basis excluding added flavors,colors, or other added substances, it is a ``<T2>XX</T2> protein concentrate'', the blank to be filled with the nameof the source of the protein, e.g., ``soy'' or ``peanut''.(3) When a product contains 90 percent or more protein by weight calculatedon a moisture-free basis excluding added flavors, colors or other addedsubstances, it is a ``<T2>XX</T2> protein isolate'' or ``<T2>XX</T2> isolated protein'', the blank to be filled in with the nameof the source of the protein, e.g., ``soy'' or ``peanut''.(c) Compliance with the moisture and protein provisions of paragraph 2(b)(1), (2) and (3) of this appendix shall be determined by the appropriatemethods described in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Associationof Official Analytical Chemists'' (latest edition).(d) Vegetable protein products which are used to resemble, and substitutein part for, meat, poultry or seafood shall be labeled in conformance withthe following:(1) The common or usual names for a vegetable protein product used to resemble,and substitute in part for, meat, poultry or seafood shall include theterm ``vegetable protein product'' and may include the term ``textured''or ``texturized'' and/or a term such as ``granules'' when such term isappropriate. The term ``plant'' may be used in the name in lieu of theterm ``vegetable''; and (2) The vegetable protein products used as ingredients in the substitutefood shall be listed by source (e.g., soy or peanut) and product type (e.g.,flour, concentrate, isolate) in the ingredient state of the label. Producttype(s) listed shall comply with the appropriate definition(s) set forthin paragraph 2(b) (1), (2) and (3), and may include a term which accuratelydescribes the physical form of the product (e.g., ``granules'') when suchterm is appropriate.(e) Vegetable protein products which are used to resemble, and substitutein part for, meat, poultry or seafood shall meet the following nutritionalspecifications:(1) The biological quality of the protein in the vegetable protein productshall be at least 80 percent that of casein, such percentage to be determinedby performing a Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) assay unless FNS grantsan exception to the PER by approving an alternate test;(2) The vegetable protein product shall contain at least 18 percent proteinby weight when hydrated or formulated to be used in combination with meat,poultry or seafood. (``When hydrated or formulated'' refers to a dry vegetableprotein product and the amount of water, fat or oil, colors, flavors orany other substances which have been added in order to make the resultantmixture resemble that meat, poultry or seafood);(3) The vegetable protein product must contain the following levels ofnutrients per gram of protein:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s20,4.2</C> <H1>Nutrient</H1><H1>Amount</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Vitamin A (IU)<D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Thiamine (milligrams)<D>0.02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Riboflavin (milligrams)<D>.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Niacin (milligrams)<D>.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pantothenic acid (milligrams)<D>.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vitamin B6 (milligrams)<D>.02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vitamin B12 (micrograms)<D>.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Iron (milligrams)<D>.15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Magnesium (milligrams)<D>1.15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc (milligrams)<D>.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper (micrograms)<D>24</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Potassium (milligrams)<D>17</D></ITAG></ITAG>(4) Compliance with the nutrient provisions set forth in paragraph 2(e)(1), (2) and (3) of this appendix shall be determined by the appropriatemethods described in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Associationof Official Analytical Chemists'' (latest edition).(f) Vegetable protein products to be used in the child nutrition programsto resemble, and substitute in part for, meat, poultry or seafood thatcomply with the labeling and nutritional specifications set forth in paragraph2(d) (1) and (2) and paragraph 2(e) (1), (2) and (3) shall bear a labelcontaining the following statement: ``This product meets USDA-FNS requirementsfor use in meeting a portion of the meat/meat alternate requirement ofthe child nutrition programs.'' This statement shall appear on the principaldisplay panel area of the package.(g) It is recommended that, for vegetable protein products to be used toresemble, and substitute in part for, meat, poultry or seafood and labeledas specified in paragraph 2(f) of this appendix, manufacturers provideinformation on the percent protein contained in the dry vegetable proteinproduct (on an as is basis.).(h) It is recommended that for a vegetable protein product mix, manufacturersprovide information on (1) the amount by weight of dry vegetable proteinproduct in the package, (2) hydration instructions, and (3) instructionson how to combine the mix with meat, poultry or seafood. A vegetable proteinproduct mix is defined as a dry product containing vegetable protein productsthat comply with the labeling and nutritional specifications set forthin paragraphs 2(d)(1) and (2) and paragraph 2(e)(1), (2) and (3) alongwith substantial levels (more than 5 percent) of seasonings, bread crumbs,flavorings, etc.3. Schools, institutions, and service institutions may use a commerciallyprepared meat, poultry or seafood product combined with vegetable proteinproducts to meet all or part of the meat/meat alternate requirement specifiedin andSection;andSection; 210.10, 225.16 or 226.20 if the product bears a labelcontaining the statement: ``This item contains vegetable protein product(s)which is authorized as an alternate food in the child nutrition programs''(outlined in paragraph 2 of this appendix). This would designate that thevegetable protein product used in the formulation of the meat, poultryor seafood item complies with the naming and nutritional specificationsset forth in paragraph 2 of this appendix. The presence of this label doesnot ensure the proper level of hydration, ratio of substitution nor thecontribution that the product makes toward meal pattern requirements forthe child nutrition programs.<ITAG tagnum="52">Appendix B_[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Appendix C_Child Nutrition (CN) Labeling Program</ITAG>1. The Child Nutrition (CN) Labeling Program is a voluntary technical assistanceprogram administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) in conjunctionwith the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and Agricultural MarketingService (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and NationalMarine Fisheries Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce (USDC) forthe Child Nutrition Programs. This program essentially involves the reviewof a manufacturer's recipe or product formulation to determine the contributiona serving of a commercially prepared product makes toward meal patternrequirements and a review of the CN label statement to ensure its accuracy.CN labeled products must be produced in accordance with all requirementsset forth in this rule.2. Products eligible for CN labels are as follows:(a) Commercially prepared food products that contribute significantly tothe meat/meat alternate component of meal pattern requirements of 7 CFR210.10, 225.16, and 226.20 and are served in the main dish.(b) Juice drinks and juice drink products that contain a minimum of 50percent full strength juice by volume.3. For the purpose of this appendix the following definitions apply:(a) ``CN label'' is a food product label that contains a CN label statementand CN logo as defined in paragraph 3(b) and (c) below.(b) The ``CN logo'' (as shown below) is a distinct border which is usedaround the edges of a ``CN label statement'' as defined in paragraph 3(c).<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus 2 208</ITAG>(c) The ``CN label statement'' includes the following:(1) The product identification number (assigned by FNS);(2) The statement of the product's contribution toward meal pattern requirementsof 7 CFR 210.10, 220.8, 225.16, and 226.20. The statement shall identifythe contribution of a specific portion of a meat/meat alternate producttoward the meat/meat alternate, bread/bread alternate, and/or vegetable/fruitcomponent of the meal pattern requirements. For juice drinks and juicedrink products the statement shall identify their contribution toward thevegetable/fruit component of the meal pattern requirements.(3) Statement specifying that the use of the CN logo and CN statement wasauthorized by FNS, and(4) The approval date.For example:<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus 2 209</ITAG>(d) ``Federal inspection'' means inspection of food products by FSIS, AMSor USDC.4. Food processors or manufacturers may use the CN label statement andCN logo as defined in paragraph 3 (b) and (c) under the following termsand conditions:(a) The CN label must be reviewed and approved at the national level bythe Food and Nutrition Service and appropriate USDA or USDC Federal agencyresponsible for the inspection of the product.(b) The CN labeled product must be produced under Federal inspection byUSDA or USDC. The Federal inspection must be performed in accordance withan approved partial or total quality control program or standards establishedby the appropriate Federal inspection service.(c) The CN label statement must be printed as an integral part of the productlabel along with the product name, ingredient listing, the inspection shieldor mark for the appropriate inspection program, the establishment numberwhere appropriate and the manufacturer's or distributor's name and address.(1) The inspection marking for CN labeled non-meat, non-poultry, and non-seafoodproducts with the exception of juice drinks and juice drink products isestablished as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">Insert illus 2 210</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/>(d) Yields for determining the product's contribution toward meal patternrequirements must be calculated using the Food Buying Guide for Child NutritionPrograms (Program Aid Number 1331).5. In the event a company uses the CN logo and CN label statement inappropriately,the company will be directed to discontinue the use of the logo and statementand the matter will be referred to the appropriate agency for action tobe taken against the company.6. Products that bear a CN label statement as set forth in paragraph 3(c)carry a warranty. This means that if a food service authority participatingin the child nutrition programs purchase a CN labeled product and usesit in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, the school or institutionwill not have an audit claim filed against it for the CN labeled productfor noncompliance with the meal pattern requirements of 7 CFR 210.10, 220.8,225.16, and 226.20. If a State or Federal auditor finds that a productthat is CN labeled does not actually meet the meal pattern requirementsclaimed on the label, the auditor will report this finding to FNS. FNSwill prepare a report on the findings and send it to the appropriate divisionsof FSIS and AMS of the USDA, National Marine Fisheries Service of the USDC,Food and Drug Administration, or the Department of Justice for action againstthe company. Any or all of the following courses of action may be taken:(a) The company's CN label may be revoked for a specific period of time;(b) The appropriate agency may pursue a misbranding or mislabeling actionagainst the company producing the product;(c) The company's name will be circulated to regional FNS offices; and(d) FNS will require the food service program involved to notify the Stateagency of the labeling violation.7. FNS is authorized to issue operational policies, procedures, and instructionsfor the CN Labeling Program.
