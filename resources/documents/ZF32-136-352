MoserandM;32 Bit Software Inc. is helping programmers take a dual development path withan enhanced version of its ZBasic language that can generate both 16-bit and32-bit applications.andM;With ZBasic-PC 4.6, available now, programmers can write applications thatexploit the expanded memory capabilities of both 386- and 486-based hardware.andM;However, they can develop these programs on older, less powerful systems,then recompile the applications in 32-bit mode for the target platform,according to officials at the Dallas company.andM;In addition, the ZBasic upgrade yields as much as a 20 percent to 50 percentdecrease in program size, officials and users said.andM;&quot;I have found it to be more streamlined in command structure, which allowsfor smaller code size over previous versions of ZBasic,&quot; said Harley Bush,president of Bush Consulting Inc., a custom software development firm inRiverdale, N.Y.andM;&quot;andlsqb;The upgradeandrsqb; is substantially smaller in code size than C and much easierto work with,&quot; he said.andM;Based on speed tests of identical ZBasic and C programs, the ZBasic codeexecuted at least as fast as the C code, and sometimes as much as 15 percentfaster on 386 systems, Bush said.andM;Other features of ZBasic-PC 4.6 include device-independent drivers thatsupport all VGA and MCGA graphics cards, and enhanced communications featuressuch as the ability to run as many as four simultaneous ports running atspeeds of up to 115,200 baud.andM;The programming tools permit the simultaneous use of two monitors and offermore efficient compilation of code, officials said.andM;Founded in 1990, the privately held 32 Bit Software develops and markets16-and 32-bit applications.andM;ZBasic, which the company purchased this year from Zedcor Inc., has beenenhanced and is the company's first commercial offering.andM;32 Bit Software will offer ZBasic-PC 4.6 at an introductory price of $99.95until July 1; after that, the retail price will be $149.95.andP;  Existing ZBasicusers can upgrade to version 4.6 for $59.95.andM;32 Bit Software can be reached at (800) 322-4879.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
