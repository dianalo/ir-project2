A looping cast sends a tiny fly soundlessly into an eddying pool. The scene could be from one of those beer commercials: It doesn't get any better than this.    Until the artillery barrage begins.    Eight-inch howitzers, in a drumbeat of thuds and booms, announce their presence a few miles away. A while later, a Huey attack helicopter thunders over the treetops. Three jet fighters follow, roaring overhead. &quot;When you put the helicopters and artillery and jets together,&quot; laments Mr. Erb, water lapping around his knees, &quot;it's just too much.&quot;    Over the past two years, such scenes have occurred with increasing frequency along the AuSable, which glides through scenic stands of pine, birch and maple and forms one of the world's great trout streams. But straddling the AuSable is one of the nation's largest military training sites, the Camp Grayling National Guard post. The presence of fisherman and fighting man along this coveted stretch of water is spawning a nasty little war here in the northern woods of Michigan's Lower Peninsula.    The clash also sets longtime residents, who see the National Guard as an economic boon, against vacation-home owners and a recent influx of retirees whose idea of permissible noise is the crackle of Fourth of July fireworks. The newcomers, many of whom live north and east of town near the bombing ranges, are used to having money, and to having things their way.    &quot;Is the state of Michigan willing to have this become the artillery range for the entire Midwest?&quot; demands an angry Robert Parks, a World War II veteran. His home in the Enchanted Forest subdivision doesn't seem so enchanted when air-to-ground missiles explode two miles away, rattling the walls.    Retorts Grayling's mayor, Robert Golnick: &quot;The Guard is Grayling. They bring a lot of money in here, and that's what you survive on.&quot;    Emotions weren't so high years back, when Camp Grayling was used mainly by the Michigan National Guard, which runs the facility. But in the mid-1970s the military draft ended, and Congress began seeking cost-effective alternatives to maintaining a large standing army. So National Guardsmen and reservists got a bigger role in the nation's defense preparedness.    They started getting more training as well. More than 145,000 weekend warriors have trooped through Camp Grayling for annual training over the past five years, up 32% from the previous five-year period. Last summer, troops came from Massachusetts and Alabama, and even Italy, which sent an air force unit to blast new craters into Camp Grayling's pockmarked bombing range. Michigan was simply reciprocating, because its bombers had previously practiced in Italy, explains Lt. Col. Brian Downey, the Michigan Guard's public-information officer.    It was definitely symbolic to anglers here, who nowadays tell war stories instead of fish stories. &quot;I've seen A10s, A7s and F4s,&quot; declares Peter Koper, an English professor at nearby Central Michigan University, recounting his jet-fighter sightings. &quot;Your sense of being on a tranquil trout stream is just shattered.&quot;    Mr. Koper belongs to Anglers of the AuSable, a 650-member group that believes blasting and casting don't mix. The anglers were shellshocked on April 30, when Michigan's trout season opened to the sound of Ohio guardsmen in M-60 tanks pounding away at targets just three miles north of the AuSable's main stream.    &quot;We'll probably be more sensitive to {opening day} in the future,&quot; says Gen. Jerome Mathieu, the Michigan Guard's No. 2 man, who has a big say in the camp's training schedules. The real problem, he adds, is that the public doesn't understand the national-defense role of the Guard or of Camp Grayling, which has terrain and climate similar to the central European theater, where many guardsmen would fight in a war. &quot;But I'm not sure that would make a difference to the people who oppose us here,&quot; the general says.    It doesn't to the AuSable Manistee Action Council, a collection of fishing, conservation and homeowner groups formed last fall to limit the Guard's activities. (Manistee refers to another trout stream nearby.) The council is pressing its case in the courts both of law and of public opinion. A suit by the group, filed in state court here last November, centers on the 1913 will of a local lumber baron named Rasmus Hanson. He left the original land for Camp Grayling to the Michigan National Guard for use as a training site and, states the will, &quot;for no other purposes whatsoever.&quot;    That should make the camp off-limits to all non-Michigan troops, the AuSable Manistee council claimed in its legal action. &quot;Let other states take care of their own {military-training} obligations and devastate their own land,&quot; declares the council's executive director, Daniel Alstott, a retiree who offers tape recordings of jets screaming above his home as evidence that things have gotten out of control.    A state judge recently dismissed the council's case, saying he lacked jurisdiction; the council has appealed, and a ruling is pending. Meanwhile, Camp Grayling officials say it is appropriate to invite out-of-state troops to Michigan in return for the Michigan Guard's occasional training missions to other states.    The camp is also launching a public-opinion counteroffensive. The opening salvo came on Memorial Day, when the Guard kicked off a celebration of its 75th year at Camp Grayling. Banners around town proclaim, &quot;Camp Grayling, Guardian of Freedom&quot;; beginning a week from today, the Guard will treat Grayling to a weekend festival of parachute jumps, cavalry drills, full-dress reviews and free concerts. The military thinks the stakes are high enough that it brought in a big-league Detroit marketing man, Joseph O'Connor -- planner of Boston's U.S. Bicentennial celebration -- to organize the whole thing.    Some in Grayling think the Guard does plenty already. The town of 2,100 residents gets an estimated $30 million annually pumped into its economy from the Guard's presence here. Mayor Golnick's two brothers and a brother-in-law are among the camp's 1,150 employees (most of whom are part time).    In a lot across from city hall, a tank, a missile and a full-size jet fighter stand mounted on display. The Guard makes a point of being ever helpful; a few years ago, a rural township's fire engine, while being refilled with water, slipped into a lake. The Guard sent over a mammoth &quot;tank retriever&quot; vehicle to fish it out.    Such favors, though, don't impress Mr. Parks or other residents of the Enchanted Forest subdivision, 10 miles northeast of Grayling. One of them, William Hutala, recently got a $2,800 government check to repair his stone chimney and glass patio door that cracked from the reverberations of bombs. The damage occurred last summer when a pilot over the bombing range, fearing he was short of fuel, dumped his payload of six 500-pound bombs in a single, earth-shattering purge. &quot;Isn't there anyplace else for them to train?&quot; Mr. Hutala asks.    Gen. Mathieu notes that the bombing range predates Enchanted Forest, which, he says, should never have been built. Developer Robert Elliott retorts that after construction began in the early 1970s, the only problem was helicopter pilots &quot;hovering over the swimming pool at the clubhouse to look at girls. Now they've increased the use of the firing range by three or four times, and turned a beautiful project into a shambles.&quot;    Amid the charges and countercharges, some voices say reason will prevail. &quot;The debate is good, not bad,&quot; insists attorney William Carey, the president of the Grayling Chamber of Commerce. And Michigan Gov. James Blanchard is appointing a commission to &quot;look at how you strike the balance&quot; between the warring factions, the governor's spokesman says.    The right balance, however, may be hard to find. &quot;We haven't been able to design weapons that don't make noise,&quot; says Gen. Mathieu. &quot;There's no place to put an artillery-impact area that won't disturb the pristine experience of hearing a trout's wink.&quot;    For Mr. Erb, a World War II veteran and avid fly fisherman, that's a tragedy. &quot;I'm not a rabble-rouser,&quot; he says, gracefully flicking his fly at the edge of a ripple that seems to promise trout. &quot;You can make a lake, but you can never make a river.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
