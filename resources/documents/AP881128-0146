REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police charged five people withillegal assembly after what the military said was an attempt bysupporters of Ferdinand Marcos to stage a mass uprising like the onethat toppled their exiled leader.   President Corazon Aquino brushed aside Saturday's events, inwhich troops turned back bus and jeep convoys carrying about 1,000civilians into the city with leaflets promising a ``constitutionalmilitary government.''   Military officials said the convoy was organized by supporters ofMarcos, who has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted in a 1986popular uprising.   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National Capital RegionDefense Command, said convoy leaders planned to surround militarygarrisons in the capital, much like the February 1986 uprising thatpropelled Mrs. Aquino to power.   But he said there was no evidence any soldiers had joined theconvoys, made up mostly of civilians from agricultural areas nearManila.   ``They were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed,''Mrs. Aquino said. ``I guess people will keep on trying (to underminethe government), but I think they should realize now that the peopleare against them and they will not support them in something likethis.''   Officials said most of those in the convoy were allowed to returnhome after police questioning, but five people were charged onMonday with illegal assembly. Police were looking for the allegedringleader, Jose Ocampo.   Oxales said troops remained on alert Monday as a precaution.Troops armed with semi-automatic rifles and machine guns were seenguarding roadblocks on the eastern edge of the capital.   Oxales said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewardsof up to $200,000 for the capture of senior military officers loyalto Mrs. Aquino.   Participants were offered money to join the convoy and were toldthey would attend rallies at the presidential palace and elsewhereto protest ``economic grievances,'' Oxales said.   Participants also were given ``liberation bonds'' they were toldcould be redeemed after the new government was installed, Oxalessaid.   Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs.Aquino. The most serious took place Aug. 28, 1987, when about 2,000mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital. Atleast 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded.   Mutiny leader Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan was arrestedin December 1987 but escaped in April.</TEXT></DOC>
