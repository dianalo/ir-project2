(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mild earthquake shook west-centralIndiana early Monday, and officials said it had no connection tothe infamous New Madrid fault elsewhere in the Midwest.   No damage or injuries were reported.   The quake shortly after midnight measured 3.0 on the Richterscale, said Larry Braile, professor of geosciences at PurdueUniversity.   It was felt from Lafayette to Crawfordsville in west centralIndiana, according to the National Earthquake Information Center inGolden, Colo.   ``It was centered two or three miles northwest of Delphi, and itoccurred at a depth of 10 kilometers, which is very common in theMidwest'' said Kelly Stemnock, earthquake program manager for theState Emergency Management Agency.   Delphi is about 50 miles northwest of Indianapolis and about 12miles northeast of Lafayette.   ``Each year we record between 10 to 20 events of this magnitudein the Midwest ... For the most part, these events are random andscattered, and unrelated to any major fault zone,'' Braile said.   Two other unrelated mild earthquakes, one in California andanother in Pennsylvania, also were reported Monday.   The California quake, centered about 60 miles east of LosAngeles, registered 3.5 on the Richer scale. The Pennsylvaniaquake, centered near Erie, registered 2.5 on the Richter scale,authorities said.   The quakes came about two weeks after the date climatologistIben Browning had projected a 50-50 chance for a major quake alongthe New Madrid fault, causing concern in parts of Indiana,Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. Browning's projectionwas based on tidal changes and was dismissed by other scientists. Amajor quake didn't occur along that fault.   Indiana is not on the New Madrid fault line, but an earthquakethere could cause damage in southern Indiana, Stemnock said.</TEXT></DOC>
