There are two aspects to be considered, the productionof the biomass resources, whether it is by special cultivation, or harvestingfrom the wild or collection of waste materials, and the conversion ofthe energy into a more useable form. Biomass energy is essentially oneof local rather than national importance, although of course use of biomassreduces the demand for conventional energies provided by a grid, etc.As such, biomass plants tend to be relatively small (less than 10 MW),but should the development of biomass involve a proliferation of suchsmall plants the negative impact could be greater than the combined effectsof individual plants. The possible implications of this will be consideredas biomass energy exploitation develops.</TEXT></DOC>
