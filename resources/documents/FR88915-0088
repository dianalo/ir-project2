Type of Application Requested  </ITAG> This announcement seeks applications for projects to develop testabletheoretical models relating to national policy concerns in the area ofproblems of the underclass. Applications should focus on research issuesin the area of economic and sociological determinants of underclass behaviorsand the effects of underclass neighborhoods on residents; other, closelyrelated issues may also be included if they are shown to be relevant tothe general area of interest.   Clearly, there are many possible definitions of the term ``underclass'',and all applications should state the definition or concept being used.A broad range of methodologies is acceptable for the purpose of this grantcompetition, and researchers are encouraged to pursue new and innovativethinking. However, all proposed projects should embody a sound theoreticalbase upon which new and original empirical work could be based in the future.Models which do not lend themselves to empirical testing are unacceptable.In addition, demonstration projects, data collection, and empirical researchwill not be funded at this time, although it is possible that continuationfunds may be awarded to test the theories developed under this grant programwithout further competition. All applicants must demonstrate knowledgeof past and current research relating to the problems of the underclassand neighborhood effects.   Successful applicants must be willing to participate in an ASPE-sponsoredconference in Washington, DC, to be held in the fall or winter of 1989.The conference will serve as a forum for discussions of important issuesconcerning the underclass, and will enable researchers to share their resultswith others.   Recent research on welfare dependency has indicated that there may bea significant correlation between neighborhood characteristics and individualbehavior, often identified as socalled underclass behavior. Underclassbehavior is not easily defined, but is usually thought to encompass variousobservable individual behaviors, such as high school drop-out rates, teenagepregnancy frequencies, welfare dependency measures, criminal activity,widespread drug use, unemployment, and poverty indicators. There can belittle doubt that a careful examination of the data will reveal significantcorrelations between neighborhood variables and various indicators of underclassbehavior. However, statistical models that estimate such correlations arenot useful for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of underclass behaviorand the influence of neighborhoods on individual choices. Purely statisticalmodels cannot distinguish between competing hypotheses and do not offerany guidance regarding the underlying causes for observed individual behavior.On the other hand, carefully specified structural models, that is, modelsthat are specified by some underlying theory, can often be used to distinguishbetween competing theories which are observationally equivalent. The developmentof theoretical models on the underclass and neighborhood effects is importantto enhance our understanding of human behavior.   One central development necessary for understanding observed behavioris the creation of a theory about how neighborhoods and residents of aneighborhood constrain the choices and behaviors of individuals in thatneighborhood. While we know something about how to model individual behavior,we know virtually nothing about how individuals interact to determine neighborhoodbehavior. While individuals may pattern their behavior after others inthe community, individuals still make choices. Hence, the connection betweenpoor neighborhood role models and individual outcomes can be broken byindividual choices. Not all individuals follow the role models they areexposed to, whether they are good or bad. Parents and other authority figuresin bad neighborhoods often offer good role models, yet the bad models insome instances dominate, while in others they do not. An individual canchoose to reject poor role models, just as he can reject good ones.   Many people believe that the frequency of underclass behavior has increasedin the United States over the last 25 years. If any policy is to be successfulin reversing this trend, it is crucial that we gain an understanding ofwhat has caused the deterioration of many neighborhoods. Since the outcomemeasures we are concerned about (e.g. welfare dependence, teenage pregnancy)describe individual behavioral patterns, it is important that we attemptto understand the influences of group behavior (the neighborhood) on theindividual. As noted above, individuals have a choice of whether to complywith certain local social norms. To some degree, there is also a choiceof where to live_those who reject local social norms can and often do move.At the same time, the pressure on individuals to accept even self-destructivebehavioral norms can sometimes be very strong. Conceptually, neighborhoodnorms for social interaction seem to be ``chosen constraints''_an individualaccepts compliance with underclass norms even when alternative exists andit is obvious that the norms are risky or clearly self-destructive.   This grant announcement seeks to encourage the development of structuralmodels that can be useful in explaining the causes for the growing incidenceof underclass behavior. In general, we are interested in how neighborhoodsand neighborhood residents influence individuals' behavior, especiallythose neighborhoods where underclass behaviors are widespread. Theoreticalmodels that could be used to answer questions such as the following wouldbe helpful:   (1) Why do some residents of underclass neighborhoods choose poor rolemodels, while others manage to seek out beneficial role models?  (2) Why do some residents eschew underclass behaviors and manage to getout of the ghetto while others become trapped?  (3) When ghetto residents attempt to ``maximize their utility'', whattypes of constraints do they face? What choices do they have?  (4) What happens to groups of individuals who are ``transplanted'' tosuburban settings, that is, those who move into housing projects or whoare blended into middle class neighborhoods?  (5) What is the impact of public or private interventions? These examplesare meant only as illustrations of interesting questions and are by nomeans exhaustive. There are many other worthwhile questions that couldbe answered by developing and testing the appropriate structural models.Because the policy recommendations obtained by testing these models arethe ultimate goal, it is important that the models be structured in sucha way that they lead to testable empirical implications, and that the applicationsindicate how the models might be tested.  1. ProductsThe applicant should present a schedule for delivery of interim progressreports and a final report. The final report should discuss possible datasources for testing the model, and if new data collection would be needed,the report should so state.   2. Potential Users  Potential users of the research include policymakers at Federal, State,and local levels of government, as well as professionals in social services,demography, economics, sociology, social work, and related fields. Becausemany of those who will be interested in this research lack advanced technicaltraining, it is important that the results of projects be presented ina fashion accessible to such an audience. This will involve the submissionof a separate, non-technical executive summary.  3. Types of Projects Excluded In consideration of the intent of this announcement, application concentratingon a narrow programmatic or policy focus, or on one that is not directedto concerns of national interest, will not be considered for funding. In addition, this announcement seeks development of theoretical modelsof underclass behavior that can provide testable hypotheses for futureempirical analysis. Applications for projects involving empirical analysis,data collection, or demonstrations will not be considered. 4. Content and Organization of the ApplicationsThe application must begin with a cover sheet followed by the requiredapplication forms and an abstract (of not more than two pages) of the application.Failure to include the abstract may result in delays in processing theapplication. Each application should include a discussion of the relevantliterature, a statement of the issue(s) being examined, the probable directionmodel development will take, a discussion of some of the likely hypothesesthat the model will explain, and a discussion of possible data sourcesto test the hypotheses. Resumes of staff should be included, as shoulda full budget and a schedule of tasks for the proposed projects.<ITAG tagnum="84">B.
