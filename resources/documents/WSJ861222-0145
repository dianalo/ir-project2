Perelman, said it intends to begin a share-buyback program as early as January.    Company executives said shares may be bought back with funds drawn from a new $500 million revolving credit agreement. The plan will be proposed to directors at their board meeting next month.    Separately, Transworld shareholders approved the company's proposed plan of liquidation, under which its Hilton International Co. unit will be sold and its three other operations will be spun off to shareholders in a new company. The tentative name of the new concern is TW Services Inc., officials said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Transworld shares closed at $33.75, down 62.5 cents.    While the company said it hasn't formalized details of its buyback plan, L. Edwin Smart, Transworld chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that he may seek authorization for purchasing $50 million to $100 million of stock at prevailing market prices.    Such expenditures could buy about 1.5 million to three million shares, or between 3% and 6% of the company's 48.5 million common shares outstanding, at current prices. Another Transworld executive noted that under the company's two previous buyback programs, directors authorized purchases of more than 10% of the common stock.    &quot;We won't pay a premium to market to anyone,&quot; Mr. Smart told shareholders at a special meeting. He had been questioned about whether Transworld is considering buying out Mr. Perelman and his group.    Under the company's liquidation plan, Transworld's anti-greenmail provision would be dropped from the charter of the spun-off company. The new company will operate Transworld's Spartan Food Systems Inc., a restaurant concern; Canteen Corp., a food-service concern; and American Medical Services Inc., a nursing home operator.    The new company will be managed by current Transworld executives and directors. Mr. Perelman's group, assuming it doesn't sell its Transworld shares, will control about 15% of the new company's shares. Under a standstill agreement that expires March 15, the group can increase its stake to about 20%.    Mr. Perelman couldn't be reached for comment.    Analysts' estimates of the trading value of the new company vary widely, from about $15 to $25 a share, depending on earnings assumptions.    As previously reported, Transworld has agreed to sell Hilton International to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines of the Netherlands for $975 million in cash. Hilton International owns or operates about 90 hotels in more than 40 countries and isn't related to Hilton Hotels Corp., Beverly Hills, Calif., which operates Hilton hotels in the U.S.    Assuming approval of the transaction by KLM's board and by the U.S. government, proceeds from the sale will be distributed to shareholders. The company estimates shareholders will receive about $20 a share from the transaction.    While distribution of shares and cash from the liquidation may take place early next year, the company said proceeds from the plan would be taxable in 1986 because of the use of a special liquidating trust. The trust mechanism will allow shareholders to take advantage of tax benefits that will dissappear next year under the new tax law.    Executives estimated expenses to investment bankers, lawyers and other parties for completing the liquidation would be about $10 million. </TEXT></DOC>
