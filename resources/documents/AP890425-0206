Robertson said Vice President Sergio Ramirez also told himNicaragua would let neutral observers inspect its militaryinstallations and allow international monitors at the borders.   ``I'm not an official of the United States government, nor do Ispeak for them,'' Robertson told a news conference. ``But it wouldappear to me as a private citizen that if the Nicaraguan governmentagrees to a comprehensive arms settlement, and if such a settlementis accompanied by truly valid verification procedures, such aproposal would be warmly received by the Bush administration.''   Nicaragua's presidential press office told The Associated Pressit would seek verification from Ramirez's office of what Robertsontold reporters.   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said the embassy had no commentbecause Robertson was on a private visit.   Neither Robertson nor Ramirez issued statements when they met atRamirez's office Monday night.   When Roberton sought the Republican presidential nomination lastyear, he strongly supported U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua, knownas Contras. In 1985, he called the Contras an ``army of God.''   President Daniel Ortega left on a 10-nation European tourSaturday seeking financial help for Nicaragua, in an economiccrisis with hyperinflation and declining production.   Several European countries have said further aid depends onNicaragua's efforts toward democratization and free and fairgeneral elections next Feb. 25.   Ortega on Tuesday addressed a session of the European Parliamentin Brussels, Belgium, and invited the parliamentarians to sendobservers to monitor Nicaragua's electoral process up to andincluding the February voting.   He pledged fair and open elections and defended a new electorallaw which his foes at home denounced as undemocratic.   ``I extend a formal invitation to the European Parliament tosend a team of observers ... so they get to know the wholepolitical situation in the country,'' Ortega said.   However, a group of about 40 people, including opposition partymembers, gathered in Managua on Tuesday to protest the government'selectoral reforms.   Violeta Chamorro, publisher of the opposition daily La Prensa,said the reforms violate accords that Ortega made last Februarywith other regional leaders. ``This is a first violation of thoseaccords. This law is a fraud,'' she said.   The opposition says the new law does not give it equal access tomedia outlets. It also says the reforms give the Sandinistascontrol of the Supreme Electoral Council.   Robertson came to Nicaragua Monday for the resumption of aSpanish-language version of his evangelical TV show ``700 Club,''which last broadcast here in August 1979, a month after theSandinistas rose to power.   ``The principal reason of my visit is religious,'' Robertsonsaid. ``Nevertheless, in my meeting with the vice president, inanswer to my questions he said, speaking for the government ofNicaragua, that he was prepared to accept as part of a CentralAmerican peace initiative reductions in the Nicaraguan army to25,000 men.''   Estimates of the size of Nicaragua's armed forces run as high as123,000 men. Robertson later said Ramirez gave no time frame foreffecting these reductions.   Ramirez also said Nicaragua would accept ``internationalmonitors of Nicaragua's borders to ensure no traffic in arms orcombatants in or out of Nicaragua or any other countries in CentralAmerica,'' according to Robertson.   Washington has accused Nicaragua of supplying arms to leftistguerrillas in El Salvador, separated by only 25 miles by the Gulfof Fonseca.   ``The vice president indicated he would agree to internationalinspections by neutral observers of Nicaraguan military equipmentand installations,'' Robertson added.   ``He also indicated to me that as part of a Central Americanpeace plan, the government would agree to complete cessation byNicaragua of accepting Soviet arms and equipment.''   Ortega and the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Ricaand Guatemala signed an accord last Feb. 14 that calls forelectoral and other reforms in Nicaragua. They also agreed to comeup with a plan by May 15 to dismantle the Contras.   About 11,000 Contras and their relatives have dwelt in Honduranjungle camps since March 1988, when Contra and Sandinista leaderssigned a cease-fire. Earlier, the U.S. Congress cut off militaryaid to the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
