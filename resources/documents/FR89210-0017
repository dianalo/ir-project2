In addition, the Fair Housing Act directs the Secretary tocoordinate with State and local agencies administering fair housing lawsand to cooperate with and to render technical assistance to public or privateentities carrying out programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housingpractices.The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP), authorized in section 561of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242,approved February 5, 1988) authorizes the Secretary to provide fundingto State and local governments or their agencies, public or private nonprofitorganizations, or other public or private entities formulating or carryingout programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices.These funds will enable the recipients to carry out activities designedto obtain enforcement of the rights granted by the Fair Housing Act orby substantially equivalent State or local fair housing laws, and educationand outreach activities designed to inform the public concerning rightsand obligations under such Federal, State or local laws prohibiting discrimination.Funding for enforcement of fair housing laws includes activities involvinguse of judicial as well as administrative enforcement procedures.On July 7, 1988, HUD published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 25576) a proposed rule to implement theFHIP authority by adoption of a new Part 125 in Title 24 of the Code ofFederal Regulations. The proposed regulations provided for funding in threedistinct areas under FHIP:1. The Administrative Enforcement Initiative (Subpart B of the new Part125);2. The Education and Outreach Initiative (Subpart C of the new Part 125);and3. The Private Enforcement Initiative (Subpart D of the new Part 125).The proposal provided a 30-day period for submission of comments by thepublic, ending August 8, 1988. HUD received a total of 33 public commentson the proposed new Part 125. Nine comments were from the National Associationof Realtors (NAR) and affiliated organizations, including 5 local Boardsof Realtors, 2 State Associations of Realtors, and the NAR-affiliated Instituteof Real Estate Management (IREM). Individual Realtors submitted 6 comments,and attorneys who represent Realtors submitted 3 comments. Six commentscame from fair housing or civil rights groups, and 6 were from State orlocal enforcement agencies (including one comment from an organizationrepresenting such agencies in a four-State region). In addition, therewas a comment from the United States League of Savings Institution, onefrom a Community Housing Resource Board (CHRB), and one from an attorneyinvolved in both prosecution and defense of housing discrimination cases.Three comments generally supported the proposed rule as written, and 24commenters supported the proposal with comments on specific provisions.Two commenters were generally opposed to the proposal, and 4 commenterslimited their comments to a suggestion that real estate brokers be compensatedfor time lost as a result of testing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Requirements</ITAG>The statutory authorization for FHIP contains several requirements relatingto program administration:(1) A requirement for submitting 30-day advance notification of each proposedgrant, contract or cooperative agreement under FHIP to the House and SenateBanking Committees (section 561(b)(1));(2) A requirement for providing to the House and Senate Banking Committeesa quarterly report that summarizes the activities funded under FHIP anddescribes the geographical distribution of FHIP grants, contracts, or cooperativeagreements (section 561(b)(2)); and(3) A requirement for submitting to Congress, within 6 months after theend of the FHIP demonstration period (September 30, 1989), an evaluationof the effectiveness of the guidelines for testing activities funded underthe Private Enforcement Initiative of FHIP (section 561(c)(2)).The NAR recommended that the final regulations contain a statement of thesethree requirements. Four additional commenters made similar recommendationswith respect to the first two requirements, and two additional commentersjoined NAR with respect to the third requirement.All three of the statutory requirements apply to HUD without regard totheir inclusion in the final regulations. The thrust of the comments urgingthe insertion of those requirements into the regulations was to ensurepublic awareness of the requirements of the law. However, HUD sees no needto include these requirements in the text of the final regulations. Further,inclusion of the statutory requirement for the submission of an evaluationof the guidelines for testing contained in this regulation within 6 monthsafter the end of the demonstration period could result in confusion regardingevaluation of further testing activities should the authorization for FHIPbe extended.The NAR and two other commenters recommended that a statement be insertedin the final regulations concerning the $3,000,000 limitation (in section561(d)) on the amount which HUD may allocate to the Private EnforcementInitiative for fiscal year 1989. In addition, one commenter suggested thatguidelines for HUD's determination as to allocation of funds be providedin the final regulations. HUD considers it unnecessary to include a statementof the statutory limitation on funding in the final program regulations,since the limitation will apply to HUD in any event. Moreover, the limitationmay change if the program is extended beyond the presently scheduled terminationdate of September 30, 1989. HUD considers the addition of guidelines tobe inappropriate because it would operate to restrict HUD's future flexibilityin an area that has been left to HUD's discretion by the statute. Moreover,any notice of funding availability for the Private Enforcement Initiative,which notice would have to be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>pursuant to 24 CFR 125.104(d), will contain astatement of the statutory limitation and a discussion of HUD's allocationof funds to activities under the Private Enforcement Initiative, togetherwith the reasons for such allocation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</ITAG>Three commenters, including the NAR and IREM, stated their belief thatHUD activities under FHIP will involve a substantial number of small entities.Accordingly, they recommend that HUD prepare a regulatory flexibility analysiswhich describes the impact of the proposed rule on small entities.In response, HUD points out that, under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the requirementsfor preparation of regulatory flexibility analyses do not apply if theSecretary certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have ``a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Although theregulations may, as the commenters suggested, affect a substantial numberof small entities, HUD does not believe that there would be ``a significanteconomic impact''on any of them, except in a case in which testing confirmsan allegation of a discriminatory housing practice. Therefore, HUD believesthat a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required for this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General</ITAG>Subpart A of Part 125 contains statements of the policy and purpose ofFHIP, definitions applicable to the provisions of Part 125, and descriptionsof the method by which HUD will administer the program and make awardsof funding.Comments were received with respect to only one section of Subpart A_andSection;125.105, which lists the requirements for applications for FHIP funding.The NAR, IREM and a State Association of Realtors stated their supportfor the requirement for a description of the specific activities to beconducted with FHIP funds. The State Association also suggested that recipientsshould be monitored to assure that they are conducting their activitiesin accordance with their applications. Since procedures for monitoringprogram activities and funding are already provided for in andSection; 125.104(e),under which the Assistant Secretary will establish specific accountingcontrols and require monitoring of records on a periodic basis by HUD Fieldstaff, the suggested changes have not been made in andSection; 125.105.However, HUD has added clarification in andSection; 125.105 to the effectthat applications for FHIP funding must address each of the criteria forselection set forth in the rule and in notices of funding availabilityfor FHIP published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Administrative Enforcement Initiative</ITAG>Under the Administrative Enforcement Initiative, HUD will provide fundingto substantially equivalent State and local fair housing enforcement agenciesin support of initiatives designed to broaden the range of enforcementand compliance activities which they conduct.Only one commenter was concerned with Subpart B. A local human relationscommission noted that the regulations in Subpart B specifically providefor funding for conducting investigations of systemic discrimination butfail to mention the continuation of funding for individual housing discriminationcase processing. Funding for individual case processing by State and localagencies will be continued by HUD under the Fair Housing Assistance Program(24 CFR Part 111).This same commenter also recommended simplification of the applicationprocess for funding under Subpart B. Since the Administrative EnforcementInitiative will provide funding for specific projects, as opposed to contributionsfor processing of individual fair housing complaints on an ongoing basis,specific applications and approvals will be necessary. However, the applicationrequirements for FHIP Subpart B funding will not affect the program administrativerequirements for complaint processing contributions under the Fair HousingAssistance Program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Education and Outreach Initiative</ITAG>The Education and Outreach Initiative will provide funding to develop,implement, carry out, or coordinate education and outreach programs designedto inform the public of their rights and obligations under the Fair HousingAct and substantially equivalent State and local fair housing laws. Fundingwill be provided for educational projects which advise the general publicand housing industry groups about fair housing rights and responsibilitiesand outreach projects which promote specialized support and coordinatedmethods to provide for fair housing.The organization representing State and local agencies in a four-Stateregion and the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission criticized the regulationson education and outreach for limiting the types of activities that couldbe undertaken by State and local agencies administering substantially equivalentfair housing laws and for extending the availability of funds to groupswho may not have the same fair housing interests as the State and localenforcement agencies. These same commenters also raised the issue of conflictin strategies for fair housing efforts and recommended the establishmentby HUD of an oversight group, which would include representation from Stateand local enforcement agencies, to coordinate strategies, make recommendationsas to funding and monitor program efforts. HUD agrees that there is a needfor non-governmental applicants to coordinate activities to be funded underthe Education and Outreach Initiative with any State or local enforcementagency in jurisdictions with substantially equivalent fair housing laws.However, the responsibility for oversight has to remain with HUD. A requirementto that effect has been added to the regulations in Subpart C.Section 125.303 provides examples of the types of educational and outreachprojects which may be funded under the Education and Outreach Initiativeof FHIP. HUD received a number of comments concerning specific provisionsof this section.One commenter, an attorney who represents several Boards of Realtors, recommendedthat paragraphs (a)(1)-(3) of that section clearly provide for the developmentof informative material, education programs and educational seminars forreal estate practitioners. HUD intends that real estate practitioners beincluded among the ``housing industry groups'' and ``other groups'' forwhom education programs may be developed and educational seminars may beprovided. Therefore, no change is necessary in those provisions.With regard to paragraph (b)(3), the NAR, IREM and two local Boards ofRealtors believe that the ``outreach projects'' specifically permittedunder that paragraph could be construed to include ``benign steering''programs designed to maintain the minority population of a community ator below a ``tipping point'', and one civil rights group took a positionagainst an interpretation of the fair housing law as ``promoting integrationgoals''. In addition, the NAR, IREM and the two State Associations of Realtorsrecommended that HUD amend paragraph (b)(3) to clarify that the ``outreachprojects'' eligible for funding do not include integration maintenance,``benign steering'' or other programs designed to limit minority residencein a neighborhood or housing complex. It is not HUD's intention to construeparagraph (b)(3) as including ``benign steering'' or integration maintenanceactivities within the meaning of ``outreach projects'', and HUD does notbelieve that the language of paragraph (b)(3) as set forth in the proposedrule requires clarification on that point.Paragraph (b)(4) of andSection; 125.303 specifically permits funding of programsrelating to ``new or more sophisticated'' discriminatory housing practices.The NAR, IREM and an attorney who represents several Boards of Realtorsrecommended that the modest funding available under this Initiative shouldbe targeted exclusively at the more ``traditional'' forms of discriminationthat are acknowledged to exist and that can most easily be identified bytesting, rather than at ``sophisticated'' techniques of discrimination.In response, HUD notes that FHIP is intended to function as a program underwhich a variety of enforcement efforts can be utilized. Therefore, HUDdoes not believe that limiting FHIP funding to traditional forms of discriminationas recommended by these commenters is consistent with the purposes of theprogram.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Private Enforcement Initiative</ITAG>The Private Enforcement Initiative will provide funding, to non-profitorganizations and other private entities that are formulating or carryingout programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices,for projects designed to enhance efforts to enforce the provisions of theFair Housing Act and substantially equivalent State and local fair housinglaws.As an overall comment, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions suggestedthat the regulations for this initiative ``enumerate with some specificity''the requirments for obtaining funds. HUD believes that the requirementsset out in the general provisions of Subpart A concerning applicationsand in the more specific provisions of Subpart D already accomplish thatpurpose. Accordingly, no changes are needed in this regard.Section 125.402_Eligible ApplicantsSection 125.402 states that applicants eligible to receive assistance underthis initiative are private non-profit organizations and other privateentities that are formulating or carrying out programs to prevent or eliminatediscriminatory housing practices. A fair housing group commented that thedefinition of eligible applicants, while appropriate for the Educationand Outreach Initiative in Subpart C, is too broad for the activities describedin andSection; 125.403 (a) and (b). This group urged that the definitionof ``eligible applicants'' be revised by adding to the first sentence ofandSection; 125.402 the following phrase: ``* * * by investigating fair housingcomplaints and seeking resolution through administrative or judicial actions.''HUD believes that this additional language would unduly restrict the operationof the program under this initiative, and the suggested change has notbeen made.Section 125.403_Eligible ActivitiesSection 125.403 sets forth four examples of projects eligible for fundingunder this initiative. Paragraph (d) includes as an eligible activity ``establishingeffective means of meeting legal expenses in support of litigation of fairhousing cases.'' Seven commenters, including the NAR, IREM and the twoState Associations of Realtors, objected to the use of Federal enforcementfunds for this purpose. Four commenters, including the NAR and IREM, recommendedthat paragraph (d) be revised to make it clear that the payment of attorneys'fees for fair housing plaintiffs is not an activity eligible for funding.The Private Enforcement Initiative was designed to fund a variety of activitiesin support of fair housing enforcement through appropriate judicial oradministrative proceedings. One such activity could be the establishmentof a mechanism, such as a revolving loan fund, to assist aggrieved personsin vindicating their fair housing rights through litigation. HUD does notbelieve that providing assistance in support of private individuals seekingto vindicate protected rights is inconsistent with the purposes of FHIP.Therefore, HUD has not made any change in paragraph (d).Section 125.405_Guidelines for Private Enforcement TestingThe Guidelines contained in this section will apply to testing activitiesfunded under the Private Enforcement Initiatives. The NAR and eight othercommenters specifically stated their support for the Guidelines as written.Two commenters, both civil rights organizations, opposed the Guidelinesin their entirety (see discussion below). Most of the commenters had suggestionsor recommendations with respect to specific provisions of andSection; 125.405.Three civil rights/fair housing organizations raised the issue of the negotiationof the Guidelines by HUD and members of the real estate industry, withoutinvolvement by the private fair housing and civil rights groups who havebeen for many years proponents of testing as the major investigative methodin fair housing cases. The fair housing group merely noted that the Guidelineswere developed without taking account of the extensive experience whichthe private groups have in developing evidence which meets the high standardsof the federal courts.The two civil rights groups went further, claiming the HUD's admitted intention,prior to the enactment of the FHIP legislation, to include the Guidelinesnegotiated with the NAR into the FHIP regulations arguably representeda violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, it was arguedthat HUD's actions ``certainly raise the appearance of impropriety,'' sincethe NAR, an entity which represents both the subject of testing (Realtors)and potential FHIP grantees (Community Housing Resource Boards), was includedin private negotiations on regulations before the program was enacted.Finally, it was asserted that HUD's actions ``raise serious questions aboutthe integrity of the comment process,'' since those groups who recommendrevision or removal of parts of the Guidelines already have been informedof HUD's intention to incorporate the Guidelines in the regulations. Accordingly,the civil rights groups recommended that the Guidelines be omitted fromthe regulations.Subsection (c)(2) of section 561 of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987, the authorizing legislation for FHIP, requires the Secretaryto establish guidelines for testing activities funded under the PrivateEnforcement Initiative of FHIP. The stated purpose of these guidelinesis to ensure that investigations in support of fair housing enforcementefforts will ``develop credible and objective evidence of discriminatoryhousing practices.'' Since regulations regarding the conduct of testingin support of fair housing enforcement efforts are required by the authorizingstatute, HUD determined to include testing guidelines in the program regulations.HUD believes that the objections raised by the three civil rights/fairhousing organizations are without substance. HUD has conducted severalstudies which involved extensive fair housing testing on a nationwide basisand had sufficient experience in the area for development of proposed guidelineswhich would meet the statutory standard described above. HUD has now hadthe benefit of public comment with respect to the guidelines containedin its proposed rule and the views of all commenters have received considerationin the preparation of the final version of the testing Guidelines. A discussionof the various issues raised by these commenters with respect to specificprovisions of the Guidelines is set forth below.Section 125.405(b)_DefinitionsParagraph (b) of andSection; 125.405 contains definitions used in that section.Paragraph (b)(1) contains the definition of ``bona fide allegation''. TheNAR, IREM and 8 other commenters specifically supported the requirementthat funded tests may be undertaken only if there has been a ``bona fideallegation'' of a discriminatory housing practice. Seven commenters opposedthe requirement.Since the Private Enforcement Initiative is a demonstration program oflimited duration and with limited financial resources, HUD believes thatit should use a specifically structured testing program. FHIP was presentedto Congress as a program to support the enforcement of the fair housinglaws and not as a research effort to document whether discrimination exists.HUD therefore believes that it is reasonable to narrow the use of the limitedresources available for this initiative to cases in which there is an indicationof a violation of the fair housing laws. Accordingly, the bona fide allegationrequirement has been retained in the final rule.The NAR and four other commenters specifically supported the eliminationof tester complaints from the definition of ``bona fide allegation'' inparagraph (b)(1). Seven commenters (four fair housing or civil rights groups,two State agencies, and the regional organization representing State andlocal agencies) opposed such elimination.The proposed rule excluded allegations by testers and testing organizationsin order to ensure the ``bona fides'' of bona fide allegations. There isno doubt that testers or testing organizations can be aggrieved and canfile complaints. However, given the specific purpose of FHIP to provideassistance in support of individual cases and the limited resources available,HUD believes that the proposed limitation is reasonable and appropriate.The final rule retains this provision as proposed.HUD notes that the exclusion of tester complaints does not prevent an organizationparticipating in Private Enforcement testing from using other informationwhich is not the result of testing as a bona fide allegation for the purposeof commencing an investigation and conducting funded testing. In addition,this exclusion does not compromise the rights of testers or the organizationsparticipating in testing activities under the demonstration to seek reliefunder the Fair Housing Act and the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <T3>Havens Realty Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Coleman,</T3> 455 U.S. 363 (1962).Two commenters proposed a revision of the definition of ``bona fide allegation''.One of the fair housing groups suggested that the definition be changedto read: ``an assertion of a discriminatory housing practice unlawful underfederal fair housing law by any individual which is attributable to a specifichousing provider by an objective method.'' The Colorado Civil Rights Divisionstated that there are problems with the requirement of a statement of specificdate, time and place of a prior discrimination. The fair housing groupalso noted that the proposed provision was unclear as to whether a testcould be undertaken without knowing the address or owner before sendingout the testers.In response to the above comments, HUD has revised the definition to permitan approximation of the date, time or place of the alleged discrimination.Moreover, a sentence has been added to indicate that the definition ofbona fide allegation does not impose a requirement that all such allegationsbe reduced to writing as a condition of the conduct of testing funded underFHIP.With regard to paragraph (b)(2), a fair housing group suggested adding``42 U.S.C. 1982'' to the definition of discriminatory housing practice.Since the statute limits programs or activities under FHIP to those designedto obtain enforcement of the rights granted by the Fair Housing Act orby substantially equivalent State or local laws, HUD cannot make the suggestedaddition. However, the definition has been modified to reflect the recentamendment of the Fair Housing Act which, among other things, expanded thedefinition of ``discriminatory housing practice'' to include acts madeunlawful by section 818 of the amended act (prohibiting interference, coercionor intimidation with regard to the exercise or enjoyment of other rightsprotected by the Fair Housing Act).Paragraph (b)(3) defines ``test'' and imposes several limitations on thetypes of tests which may be funded under the Private Enforcement Initiative.Two of these limitations_the requirement for testing the same agent andthe requirement for two matched testers_were the subject of all of thecomments on paragraph (b)(3). The NAR, IREM and six other commenters specificallysupported either or both of these limitations. Five civil rights or fairhousing groups and the Colorado Civil Rights Division opposed either orboth of the limitations.HUD has considered the arguments both for and against these two limitationsand has decided to make no change in the regulations with respect to eitherof them. However, in the event that a participant in FHIP makes a goodfaith effort, in conducting a test, to comply with these requirements butfinds it impossible to meet one or both of them, HUD can nevertheless permitthe use of FHIP Funds to pay for the testing activity. Reimbursement inthese circumstances may be appropriate so that participants are not discouragedfrom conducting FHIP testing activities in response to all bona fide allegations,and it is also consistent with HUD's position that the Guidelines in thisregulation are not intended to establish the only method of obtaining credibleand objective evidence through testing in fair housing cases.HUD has made an editorial change in the introductory language of paragraph(b)(3) to make it clear that any ``test'' conducted under the Guidelinesmust be in response to a bona fide allegation.Section 125.405(c)_Eligible ActivitiesParagraph (c) provides certain procedures which must be followed in conductingeligible testing activities. Paragraph (c)(2)(i) requires the careful recordationof all relevant information, after a test, on standardized forms. An attorneysuggested adding language to require the tester to fill out the testerform in his or her own words. HUD does not believe that such a requirementis necessary; it is enough to have the tester sign the form to attest toits accuracy. Accordingly, the words ``signed by the respective testers''have been inserted in paragraph (c)(2)(i).As proposed, paragraph (c)(2)(ii) would have prohibited any contact orcommunication between pairs of testers until all information has been recordedand the testers debriefed by the testing coordinator. Four fair housingor civil rights groups took the position that there should be no prohibitionon contact between testers, only on communication of testing experiences.One of these groups asked whether the proposed language was intended toprohibit visual contacts between testers (for coordination of tests).HUD agrees with these commenters that the restriction in the proposed rulewas not intended to prohibit all communication between testers. In response,HUD has revised paragraph (c)(2)(ii) to require a prohibition on communicationbetween pairs of testers relating to the conduct of the test or to testingexperiences or results. Thus, while matters related to the conduct or coordinationof the tests would have to be handled by the testing coordinator, contactor communication between the testers themselves would be permitted forother purposes, such as sharing of transportation.A fair housing group opposed the requirement in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) thatthe same or substantially equivalent type of housing accommodations, financing,or service be requested in a test. HUD believes that this requirement isneeded for evidentiary purposes, and no change has been made.The same fair housing group recommended that a definition of the term ``systemic'',which is used in paragraph (c)(2)(iv), be included in the regulations.In response, HUD has inserted the parenthetical phrase ``a pattern or practiceof discriminatory housing practices by a housing provider or lender'' afterthe phrase ``systemic discrimination'' in the second sentence of paragraph(c)(2)(iv).In paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C), a fair housing group suggested substitutionof the word ``initiate'' for ``conduct'', to allow for trips away fromthe office to visit houses or apartments during the course of a test. HUDhas made the suggested change.A fair housing group raised several issues with respect to the ``pairedtester'' requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(A-D). First, the group tookthe position that, if a duplication of the complainant's profile is notrequired in systemic cases, there is no basis to require such duplicationin the ``individual'' testers' profiles for non-systemic cases. Further,it should not be necessary to duplicate the profile or housing needs ofthe complainant in all respects; it should be sufficient for the testersto match each other. Finally, the group noted that the proposed provisionis unclear as to which particular aspects of a complainant's profile needto be duplicated.In response, HUD notes that in the systemic testing situation a numberof tests will be conducted, while in testing for discrimination againstan individual, only one test will usually be needed. In the systemic multi-testsituation, it would not be practical to require that all testers' profilesmatch the profile of the complainant, since such a requirement would undulyrestrict the range of systemic testing that could be conducted. Moreover,such a requirement would make it obvious to the respondent that testingwas being conducted. However, in the single-test individual complaint situation,the profile-matching requirement would not cause the same problem. Nevertheless,HUD acknowledges that even in some individual complaint situations it maybe difficult or undesirable to match the testers' profiles with that ofthe complainant. For example, in a case where the person making the bonafide complaint has unusual housing needs or an unusual source of income,it may not be possible to have the testers represent that they have equivalenthousing needs or a similar income source. Accordingly, HUD has insertedlanguage in the first sentence of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) to indicate thatthe testers' profiles must match the complainant's profile only to theextent that it is practicable to do so.With respect to the last of the fair housing group's comments, HUD believesthat the proposed language concerning demographic profiles provides a degreeof flexibility which would be lost if the provision were revised to specifywhich particular aspects of a complainant's profile must be duplicated.In addition, the words ``handicap'' and ``familial status'' have been insertedin two places in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) to reflect amendments to the FairHousing Act made by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.Paragraph (c)(3)(i) prohibits testers and the testing organization fromhaving an economic interest in the outcome of the test. A fair housinggroup asked whether ``economic interest'' includes a court-ordered requirementfor management training. Also, does the provision bar fees for monitoringservices?Although a later, court-imposed provision for management training of arespondent's staff would not constitute an ``economic interest'' in theoutcome of a test, such a provision would be barred by paragraph (d)(2),under which an applicant for funding of testing activities must agree notto ``seek to provide fair housing educational services'' to a respondentorganization for compensation. With regard to the question of fees formonitoring services, HUD has revised paragraph (d)(2) to make it clearthat educational and <T3>other </T3>services would be barred if compensation were involved.There were several comments concerning paragraph (c)(3)(ii), which is designedto prevent conflicts of interest with respect to testers and testing organizations.A fair housing group asked whether that paragraph's conflict of interestprovisions would operate to bar licensed housing providers from the boardof directors of a fair housing agency. Instead, this commenter recommendedsetting a limit on the percentage of the organization's board which maybe comprised of such persons. Since the members of an organization's boardof directors are neither employees nor agents of the organization, thepresence of licensed housing providers on the board would not prevent theorganization from engaging in testing activities under FHIP. Thus, it isnot necessary to adopt the commenter's recommendation in order to allowhousing providers to serve on the board of a testing organization.The same commenter found it unclear whether the conduct of housing placementservices by a fair housing organization would disqualify it from testingas a ``licensed competitor''. This commenter also questioned whether developmentof affordable housing would disqualify a fair housing organization. Thecommenter believes that such activities should not disqualify otherwiseeligible fair housing groups from FHIP testing. If the nature of the servicesperformed by the fair housing organization requires it to obtain a license,then the organization could be a licensed competitor of a testing subject``in the listing, rental, sale or financing of real estate property,''thereby disqualifying the organization from using FHIP funds to test thatsubject. In the interest of keeping FHIP free of conflict of interest problems,HUD has not changed the regulations in response to this commenter's suggestion.The Colorado Civil Rights Divison recommended that there be an exceptionin paragraph (c)(3)(ii) for testing for Boards of Realtors and apartmentassociations that wish to do testing of their own members for self-policingor educational purposes. Under the authorizing statute, the primary purposeof the Private Enforcement Initiative demonstration is funding of programsor activities designed to obtain <T3>enforcement </T3>of the rights granted by the Fair Housing Act or substantiallyequivalent State or local laws. Therefore, HUD wishes to concentrate thelimited resources available for testing activities on testing for enforcementpurposes rather than spread the funding out to include testing of housingindustry group members for self-policing or educational purposes. Accordingly,this recommended change has not been adopted.  A fair housing group commented that paragraph (c)(3)(ii) is too broad andtoo general. This commenter felt that while it is legitimate to bar thosewho might have a direct conflict of interest, there is no good reason tobar all real estate persons from testing. This group suggested two languagechanges. First, that the provision on prior employment or affiliation berevised by adding the words ``within one year''. Second, that the languageon ``licensed competitor'' be changed to read:<ITAG tagnum="20">``* * * is an active participant in a real estate sales, rental orfinancing business in the same immediate market, except that such a personexclusively engaged in rental real estate is not barred from acting asa tester of firms or agents exclusively engaged in real estate sales andsuch a person exclusively engage in real estate sales is not barred fromacting as a tester of firms or agents exclusively engaged in real estaterentals;''</ITAG>HUD has adopted this group's first suggestion, since the provison as proposedwould be too far-reaching and could serve to insulate a particular housingindustry firm from testing if any former employee was now participatingwith a fair housing group conducting a testing program.  HUD has not adopted the second suggestion, to revise the ``licensed competitor''language. HUD believes that this suggestion would draw too fine a distinctionas to what constituted an impermissible conflict of interest for testingpurposes and would unnecessarily complicate a clear and simple rule.Section 125.405(d)_Application Requirements  Paragraph (d) of andSection; 125.405 contains special requirements for applicationsfor funding of testing activities.  The NAR, IREM and a local Board of Realtors specifically supported therequirement in paragraph (d)(1) that the applicant have at least one yearof fair housing enforcement experience. The Colorado Civil Rights Divisionrecommended an amendment to provide that an applicant agency may be acceptable,even in the absence of the required experience, if the agency can demonstratethat it will hire personnel, consultants or firms with demonstrated competencein the program proposed to be funded. HUD believed that the requirementin paragraph (d)(1) for a continuing commitment to fair housing enforcementis important as a prerequisite for participation in the testing program,and the suggested change has not been made.  A fair housing group suggested limiting the language of paragraph (d)(1)by adding the following: ``by investigating fair housing complaints andseeking resolution through administrative or judicial actions.'' HUD believesthat this additional requirement would be too restrictive and has not adoptedthe group's suggestion. However, HUD has added a requirement that the applicantshow that it has sufficient knowledge of fair housing testing to enableit to implement a testing program successfully.  Paragraph (d)(2) bans solicitation of funds or compensation for servicesby applicants from subjects of testing. The NAR, IREM and four other commentersspecifically supported this provision. Two fair housing groups opposedit. As noted in the discussion of paragraph (c)(3)(i) above, HUD has madea clarifying change in paragraph (d)(2).Section 125.405(e)_Performance Monitoring  A fair housing group recommended that the sanctions described in paragraph(e) not be applied to organizations acting in good faith. Since sanctionsare discretionary rather than mandatory, it is contemplated that HUD willconsider the ``good faith'' of an organization's actions in determiningwhether or not to impose sanctions on it.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Comments  </ITAG>The U.S. League of Savings Institutions suggested that HUD publish, onan annual basis, an accounting of how FHIP funds were used in various programareas. Since the accounting suggested by this commenter would largely duplicateinformation to be contained in the quarterly report required to be submittedto the Senate and House Banking Committees (see discussion under ``StatutoryRequirements'' above), HUD has not adopted the suggestion.  A local Board of Realtors and three individual Realtors made suggestionsfor compensation of real estate brokers for time lost as a result of testing.HUD points out that there is no provision in the authorizing legislationfor the payment of such compensation. Accordingly, these suggestions havenot been adopted.  The State of Connecticut Comprehensive Planning Division recommended thatthe regulations include a provision to allow for extensions of an agreementdue to delay caused by circumstances beyond the grantee's control, suchas loss of key personnel responsible for administration of the project.Extensions of time to perform specified activities under a contract, grantor cooperative agreement may be given by HUD on a case-by-case basis, ascircumstances may warrant. There is no need to include such a provisionin the FHIP regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters  </ITAG>Under the provisions in the FHIP authorizing legislation, the Secretary,before providing any assistance under this program, is required to issueregulations governing applications for funding. Such regulations cannotbe effective prior to the expiration of 90 calendar days from the datethose regulations are submitted to the House and Senate Banking Committees.A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection and copying during regular business hours in the Office of theRules Docket Clerk, Room 10278, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC20410. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. Under 5 U.S.C 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersignedhereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. Although the activities to beundertaken with funding under FHIP may have some economic impact on a substantialnumber of smaller entities, HUD does not expect that there will be manycases in which the economic impact will be substantial. In addition, thisrule would not significantly increase or decrease the administrative burdenon persons conducting activities relating to the sale, rental or financingof dwellings. HUD has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not havefederalism implications within the meaning of E.O. 12612_<T3>Federalism</T3>, because it does not have substantial direct effectson the States (including their political subdivisions), or on the relationshipbetween the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution ofpower and responsibilities among the various levels of government. HUD has determined that this rule is not likely to have a significant impacton family formation, maintenance, and general well-being with the meaningof E.O. 12606_<T3>The Family</T3>, because it does not affect the role or institutionof the family in society. The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review undersection 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assignedOMB Control Number 2529-0033. Sections 125.104(e), 125.105 and 125.404(d)of this final rule have been determined by the Department to contain collectionof information requirements.

These guidelines applyonly to testing activities funded under this initiative and do not limitor restrict the use of facts secured through other testing activities inany legal proceeding under Federal fair housing laws. Nothing in this sectionrestricts individuals or entities participating in the Fair Housing InitiativesProgram from pursuing any right or remedy guaranteed by Federal law, orfrom the conduct of other testing or other investigative activities notfunded under the Private Enforcement Initiative. (b) <T3>Definitions. </T3>As used in this section: (1) The term ``bona fide allegation'' means an assertion of a discriminatoryhousing practice unlawful under Federal fair housing law. For purposesof these guidelines, an allegation by a person engaged as a tester, whetheror not compensated, or by any organization, employee, or agent engageddirectly in the initiation, administration, evaluation, or conduct of testsis not a bona fide allegation. The allegation must state specifically andin detail the facts and circumstances which are believed to constitutethe discriminatory housing practice; these facts should include the date,time, and place (or an approximation of the date, time or place) of thealleged discrimination, and the name of each person or firm allegedly engagedin the discriminatory housing practice. However, while the allegation mustbe documented, it need not be reduced to writing prior to the conduct ofa test. (2) The term ``discriminatory housing practice'' means any action madeunlawful by section 804, 805, 806 or 818 of Title VIII (42 U.S.C. 3604,3605, 3606 or 3618). (3) The term ``test'' means a method of gathering credible and objectiveevidence of whether a discriminatory housing practice has occurred, conductedin response to a bona fide allegation. For purposes of tests conductedunder these guidelines: (i) In the case of a test conducted in response to an allegation involvingthe rental or financing of a home or apartment, a test must include oneor more visits by at least two individual testers to the lender, rentalagent, management firm or owner alleged to have discriminated. (ii) In the case of a test conducted in response to an allegation involvingthe purchase of a home, a test must include one or more visits by at leasttwo individual testers to the individual sales agent or owner alleged tohave discriminated; or if a firm is alleged to have engaged in discriminatoryhousing practices and if no sales agent of the firm has been identifiedas having discriminated, then the test must include one or more visitsby at least two paired testers as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of thissection to any sales agent identified by the testing program. The testrequirements specified shall not excuse any employer, broker, firm, orowner from such liability as the law imposes on them for the conduct oftheir employees or licensees affiliated with them. Nothing here shall limitthe number of test visits which can be made or funded.   (4) The term ``testers'' means individuals, who without an intent to rent,purchase, or finance a home or apartment, pose as renters, purchasers,or borrowers for the purpose of collecting evidence of discriminatory housingpractices.(c) <T3>Eligible activities. </T3>Eligible testing activities must be conductedin accordance with procedures contained in the application for assistance.These procedures shall include the following:(1) A formal recruitment process designed to obtain a pool of credibleand objective persons to serve as testers. Recruits must not have priorfelony convictions or convictions of crimes involving fraud or perjury.(2) A tester training program which will_(i) Require the careful recordation of all relevant information on standardizedforms, signed by the respective testers, following completion of the test;(ii) Prohibit any communication between pairs of testers relating to theconduct of the test or to testing experiences or results until all informationhas been recorded and the testers debriefed by the testing coordinator;(iii) Require that the same or substantially equivalent type of housingaccommodations, financing, or service be requested; and(iv) Require that, to the extent practicable, testers identify themselvesas having the same or substantially equivalent housing needs and demographicprofiles as the person who made the bona fide allegation, except for theperson's race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, nationality,or other attribute which is the basis of the alleged discrimination. Incases of testing for systemic discrimination (e.g., a pattern or practiceof discriminatory housing practices by a housing provider or lender), demographicprofiles may vary from that of the person who made the bona fide allegationso long as the test of each agent or owner is a ``paired'' test. For thepurpose of these guidelines, a ``paired test'' means that the two testerswho will conduct the ``paired test'' shall_(A) Have the same or substantially similar demographic profiles, exceptfor their race, color, religion, handicap, familial status, sex, nationality,or other attribute which is the basis of the alleged discrimination;(B) Have the same or substantially similar housing requirements;(C) Initiate the test at the same office or in the same or substantiallysimilar transactional conditions and circumstances; and(D) Conduct the test in a timely manner.(3) A tester assignment and control system which will assure that neitherthe tester, nor the organization conducting the test, including its employeesand agents_(i) Has an economic interest in the outcome of the test, without prejudiceto the right of any person or entity to recover damages for any cognizableinjury (see, <T3>Havens Realty Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Coleman, </T3>455 U.S. 363 (1982), 3 PHEOH andpara; 15,341); or(ii) Has a specific bias toward either the person who made the bona fideallegation or the respondent; is a relative of one of the parties in thecase; has had any employment or affiliation within one year with the personor organization to be tested; is a licensed competitor of such person ororganization in the listing, rental, sale, or financing of real estateproperty; or has any other specific bias or conflict or interest whichwould prevent or limit his or her objectivity or fairness.(d) <T3>Application requirements. </T3>Applications for funding of testingactivities must include, in addition to the requirements set forth in andSection;125.105:(1) Documentation that the applicant has at least one year of experiencein carrying out a program to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housingpractices and has sufficient knowledge of fair housing testing to enablethe applicant to implement a testing program successfully.(2) A certification providing that the applicant will not solicit fundsfrom or seek to provide fair housing educational or other services or productsfor compensation, directly or indirectly, to any person or organizationwhich has been the subject of testing by the applicant for a 12-month periodfollowing a test;(3) A description of the process to be used to recruit testers;(4) A description of the tester training program; and(5) Copies of forms used to document allegations and to record the experienceof testers.<ITAG tagnum="21">(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number2529-0033, expires May 31, 1991.)</ITAG>(e) <T3>Performance monitoring. </T3>An applicant failing to comply with thetesting requirements or the procedures set forth in its application forfunding shall be liable for such sanctions as may be authorized by law.These sanctions include repayment of improperly used funds, terminationof further participation in the initiative, reduction or limitation offurther funding for investigatory activities, recapture of improperly expendedfunds, and denial of further participation in programs of the Departmentor any Federal agency.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Judith Y.
