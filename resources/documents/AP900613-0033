De Maiziere addressed the club on his first trip to the UnitedStates, which may be his last as the formerly communist EastGermany hurtles toward reunification in three weeks with WestGermany, whose economy is quite healthy.   He said unity would be costly to West Germany in the short runbut that over a longer period it would bring an economic boom _especially if West Germans invest in East Germany instead of justmarketing their goods there.   If West Germany saw its eastern neighbor only as new customers,it would lead to great social tensions and reproaches, he added.   On July 2, the nearly worthless East German mark will bereplaced by highly valuable West German marks. The exchange ratewill be one-for-one. Under communism, East German black marketeerswere willing to pay seven, or even 10, to one.   Klaus Friedrich, former head of German affairs at the FederalReserve, predicted that East Germany will achieve West Germanliving standards in 10 years as a result of unification.   Friedrich, now with the Institute of International Finance, alsoforesaw East German unemployment skyrocketing from 1 percent to 11percent by the end of the year, robbing 1 million people of theirjobs. He also predicted many formerly state-run factories, unableto compete in a capitalist marketplace, would close.   But in a speech to the National Economists Club, Friedrich saidGerman prices would remain fairly stable.   ``I think that inflation, which currently runs between 2 and 3percent in West Germany, will not be the dire consequencepredicted,'' he said.   ``Even if it doubles, which is unlikely, it will still be withina tolerable range.''   Generous West German social security benefits, to be granted toEast Germans, are expected to cushion the effect of unemployment.</TEXT></DOC>
