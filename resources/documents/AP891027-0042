ATandamp;T filed a countersuit in U.S. District Court on Thursday inresponse to MCI's Oct. 10 false advertising suit.   MCI's ads for long-distance service have ``misled customersabout prices, about the quality and reach of its service and aboutits facsimile service,'' Victor Pelson, ATandamp;T group executive, toldreporters.   ``MCI, instead of cleaning up its own advertising act, had thegall to file a lawsuit,'' Pelson said. ``We stand by ouradvertising.''   MCI Chairman William McGowan said when his company filed itssuit that ATandamp;T was desperately trying to save its erodinglong-distance business and was losing 100,000 customers a week.   Pelson said McGowan's claim was ``absurd.''   MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan said Thursday that ATandamp;T failedto challenge that MCI allegation in its countersuit.   ``The most significant thing about ATandamp;T's countersuit was whatwas not in it,'' she said.   The suits are the latest chapters in MCI's long battle with ATandamp;Tthat began in the 1970s when MCI successfully broke ATandamp;T'slong-distance monopoly.   ATandamp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long-distance market,as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2with more than 10 percent.   ATandamp;T's U.S. District Court suit denies MCI's allegations andasks the court to enjoin MCI from making false or deceptiverepresentations. It also asks the court to order MCI to makecorrective ads.   ATandamp;T seeks unspecified profits ``wrongfully amassed by MCI onthe sale of its products or services during the period inquestion,'' plus treble the damages that ATandamp;T has sustained becauseof ``MCI's false and-or deceptive ads'' and legal and court costs.   MCI's suit alleged that ATandamp;T was engaged in maliciously falseand deceptive advertising. It said ATandamp;T launched a counterattack inJanuary against competitors to regain market share, and in Julybegan targeting MCI's new Primetime, cut-rate long-distance callingplan.   Merrill Tutton, ATandamp;T vice president for consumer services, citedan MCI ad that says ``MCI always saves you money.'' He said MCI wasmaking ``apples and oranges'' comparisons between its cut-ratecalling plans and ATandamp;T's standard long-distance rates.   He defended an ad, which had particularly incensed McGowan,showing a satellite picture of the earth with a quarter segment ofthe planet missing, including Europe, the Middle East and NorthAfrica. The ad copy asks: ``Is this how your worldwidelong-distance company sees the world?''   McGowan said the ATandamp;T ad implied its competitors didn't serveEurope.   ``It's not meant to be Europe,'' Tutton said, adding that MCIdoesn't serve 45 countries, including the Soviet Union and Cuba.   MCI's suit asked that ATandamp;T be enjoined from making false ordeceptive representations that any ATandamp;T service is superior or thatMCI has misrepresented its services or rates. It also seekscorrective notices, unspecified profits, interest and legal fees.</TEXT></DOC>
