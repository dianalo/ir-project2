Postal worker Patrick Henry Sherrill shot and killed 14co-workers and wounded six others on Aug. 20, 1986, before takinghis own life.   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of 11relatives of the victims and the six wounded, is the second to seekdamages in the massacre.   The suit alleges that Dale Fowlkes, postmaster at Edmond at thetime, authorized putting pressure on Sherrill in hopes of forcinghis resignation and should have known that Sherrill was unstable.   Fowlkes, who retired from the Postal Service on March 13, saidThursday he was in charge of 125 people and ``I didn't know themthat well.''   The suit also faulted the Edmond Police Department for notimmediately storming the post office during the shooting rampage,which last more than an hour.   Then-Police Chief Clent Dedek, now Oklahoma's public safetycommissioner, said Thursday he had not seen the suit and declinedcomment.   National Guard officials _ one of them an unidentifiedmarksmanship coordinator _ were accused of failing to investigateSherrill's background before giving him access to guns andammunition.   The suit alleged that the coordinator should have discoveredthat Sherrill had threatened to kill a weapons instructor.   Sherrill was a Guard marksmen authorized to check out pistolsand ammunition. The Guard said the two .45-caliber handgunsSherrill carried into the post office had been issued to him forpractice and a competition.   In December, the family of Jerry R. Pyle, who was killed in theattack, sued the National Guard, the city of Edmond and Sherrill'sestate in state court seeking unspecified damages. That case hasnot gone to trial.</TEXT></DOC>
