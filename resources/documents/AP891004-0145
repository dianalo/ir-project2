Fiftystudents were arrested.   All 8,000 students were ordered to leave the University ofZimbabwe campus by noon Thursday. Police sealed off entrances tothe campus as darkness fell. Riot squads barred students fromentering the campus.   The violence began after the arrests of student councilofficials Arthur Mutambara and Enock Chikweche. In a leafletdistributed before the start of classes, student leaders called fora meeting to discuss the arrests.   The leaflet alleged police surrounded and stormed a campusresidence and that Mutambara was ``profusely bleeding'' afterjumping from a second-floor window in an effort to escape police.   Student leaders said they believed Mutambara's arrest wasprompted by a statement he issued Oct. 2 criticizing the governmentand university authorities.   The University of Zimbabwe's vice chancellor, Walter Kamba,announced the closing at a news conference after conferring withPresident Robert Mugabe.   Kamba called the move ``regrettable and sad'' and said it was auniversity decision and not the government's.   But student leaders, who requested anonymity, told TheAssociated Press they believed Mugabe had personally ordered theshutdown because of widespread student disillusionment with theleadership over top-level corruption.   About 4,000 students boycotted classes and many fought runningbattles with baton-wielding riot squads through the day, a studentspokesman said. Rioters threw stones at police and smashed thewindows of a limousine used by Kamba.   Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day and thesemi-official Zimbabwe Inter African News Agency said more than 50protesters were arrested. They could face up to five years inprison. Students said police injured several protesters.   In the past year, college students have staged severaldemonstrations in which they accused the government of stiflingfree expression and curbing academic freedoms. They also haveprotested official corruption.   Education minister Fay Chung has called students ``hooligans anddrunkards'' who were being manipulated by political opponents toattack the government.</TEXT></DOC>
