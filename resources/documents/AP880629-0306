The deed of purchase from that deal lays the basis for thefirm's claim to be world's oldest continuously operating company.   Today, the 700-year-old firm _ Stora Kopparberg AB in Swedish _is undergoing an expansion program that is typical of theaggressive style of Swedish business facing increasing competitionfor access to European markets.   As it marks its birthday, the company is celebrating its successat shedding less productive businesses and establishing itself as aworld power in forest products.   Some 9,000 shareholders are noting the seven-century mark thissummer with parties, sporting events and a shareholders meeting inthe mine's 300-foot-deep open pit.   Stora reportedly is spending up to $16 million on the birthday,including invitations this year to its 22,000 employees to visitthe company's headquarters in this town in central Sweden.   The mine had already existed for some 200 years and had providedswords for Viking raiders when Bishop Peter bought into the companyback in the 13th century. He apparently was acting on a tip frommonks in Europe of a technological advance in water wheels thatcould be used for power in the mine and greatly increase profits.   The mine was the source of wealth for the Swedish empire duringthe 17th century. Now Stora is devoted mostly to paper and pulpproduction, and the mine in the mountains outside Falun is keptopen more for sentimental than for economic reasons.   ``After 700 years, we don't want to be the ones to close themine,'' said Tommy Forss, curator of a small company museum.   Stora owns forests half the size of Belgium, produces enoughliquid packaging board to make two milk cartons for every person inthe world, and makes newsprint for Sweden's newspapers and for someof Europe's largest dailies.   A restructuring plan begun 10 years ago disposed of thecompany's steel interests and diversified its forest-productsholdings. Since 1984, it has acquired leading manufacturers ofboard, packaging and fine papers. Stora president Bo Berggren andboard chairman Peter Wallenberg are credited with the success ofthe transformation.   In March, the company made it boldest move yet, acquiringSwedish Match AB, a multinational consumer products group, for $1billion in the largest cash and securities deal in Swedish history.Both companies are dominated by investments companies controlled bythe wealthy industrialist Wallenberg family.   The latest move was one of a series of business consolidationsby the nonaligned Swedes, who are bracing for the elimination oftrade barriers within the European Economic Community in 1992.   Sweden has remained outside the Common Market to safeguard itsneutral foreign policy, but it is bargaining for ``economicintegration'' that will protect it from discrimination once the EECdismantles internal tariffs.   In the meantime, companies have begun merging or increasingtheir holdings in EEC-based industries to keep doors ajar whichotherwise might be slammed shut in 1992.   For instance, Swedish Match, the world's leading manufacturer oflighters and wooden matches, recently bought Wilkinson Sword, amajor British producer of matches, shaving products and otherhousehold goods, and the West German flooring group Pegulan. Bothoffer Stora access to the Common Market.   ``We have to create the financial entities with strength enoughto meet the competition. That means consolidation,'' said Storapresident Berggren in an interview.   He said Stora and Swedish Match sell half their production tothe EEC, or about 20 billion kronor ($3.3 billion), making thecombined company too big to be ignored.   In similar fashion, Asea AB merged with Switzerland's BrownBoveri and Co. late last year to become the world's largest heavyelectrical engineering firm. Although both Sweden and Switzerlandare outside the EEC, the newly merged company has enough holdingsin EEC countries to give it a pipeline into the market.   Ultimately, Berggren said, Sweden will have to join the EEC toavoid isolation. As for now, ``by establishing ourselves within theCommon Market, we at least limit the disadvantage.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions July 2-3</NOTE></DOC>
