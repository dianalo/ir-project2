About a dozen major commercial banks have direct access to the New York Fed, which handles the U.S. government's foreign-currency trading. But in recent years, some investment banks -- among them Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. -- have become major currency traders as well. Now the three firms, and perhaps others, are applying for direct lines to the New York Fed.    Getting a &quot;line&quot; with the New York Fed would admit investment banks into the exclusive club of institutions that the central bank calls to gather market information.    Perhaps most importantly, the Fed also deals with these institutions when it intervenes in the foreign exchange market. Besides being profitable in itself, handling even small bits of the Fed's foreign exchange business can help a bank trade more profitably with other market participants. And the appearance of having access to such knowledge can be a big selling point with customers.    &quot;The world of foreign exchange is changing,&quot; says David Schoenthal, executive vice president and director of commodity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Co.    &quot;Banks want to become more like brokerage firms, and investment houses want to do many of the things commercial banks do,&quot; Mr. Schoenthal says. &quot;As our activities expand, we would be looking for the Fed to become more involved with us.&quot; Although some investment bankers expect a positive response to their requests soon, the Fed hasn't indicated its leanings one way or the other.    &quot;We have not historically dealt with (institutions) other than commercial banks in the foreign exchange market,&quot; a Fed spokesman says. The Fed is &quot;aware&quot; of the &quot;interest&quot; by the investment banks, he says.    The issue may pose a difficult dilemma for the Fed. By refusing the securities firms, the Fed would be limiting its own access to information from an increasingly important segment of the market. However, by granting the requests the Fed would further blur the demarcation between the businesses of commercial and investment banking.    Investment firms have jumped into the foreign exchange business with a vengeance. In a &quot;conservative&quot; estimate, Shearson Lehman's daily foreign exchange volume ranges between $2 billion and $3 billion, double the turnover five years ago, says Mr. Schoenthal, the head of trading.    Salomon Brothers' currency trading volume grew about 25% to $332 billion last year, or almost double the firm's equity trading.    Meanwhile, for the first time last year the Fed included non-bank financial institutions in its periodic survey of the U.S. foreign exchange market. While admitting that its survey may have failed to cover non-banks as thoroughly as commercial banks, the Fed's report indicated that non-bank trading volume averaged $13.9 billion a day during the survey period, or more than 20% of the total.    Investment bankers say their expansion into foreign exchange is a natural outgrowth of their increasingly global capital markets operations.    By establishing formal links to investment concerns, the Fed would benefit most from access to their firsthand knowledge of international capital flow, which plays a big part in exchange rate swings, the firms say.    &quot;We see capital flows more directly than the banks,&quot; the Fed deals with, an investment banker boasts. &quot;We can give them better insights.&quot;    The issue of direct access raises significant policy and possibly legal questions: Does the Fed have authority to deal with entities beyond its regulatory control? And if the Fed opens lines with some investment banks, must it then open its doors to all non-bank institutions? What criteria should it use for admission to its club?    &quot;They'd be reluctant to endorse some of the names that might seek lines,&quot; says an executive at a Wall Street firm seeking a tie-in. To currency traders, having &quot;a line&quot; with the Fed refers to a direct, private telephone hookup with the central bank's foreign exchange desk.    The Fed may also &quot;feel uncomfortable&quot; issuing credit lines to some investment banks, the executive says.    Commercial banks, wary of possible encroachment on their province, may be quietly lobbying the Fed to maintain the status quo, investment bankers fear. Some commercial bankers simply voice resignation, though.    &quot;Investment banks and commercial banks are moving more and more in each other's direction,&quot; says Kent Mitchell, head of foreign exchange at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.    &quot;It seems inevitable that we'll be in each other's territory.&quot;    ---   Friday Market Activity   The dollar was narrowly mixed Friday in moderate trading with a downward trend, as the currency slipped on U.S. economic news but recovered some of its losses.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7788 West German marks, down from 1.7825 Thursday. The U.S. unit climbed to 139.60 Japanese yen from 139.25. The British pound was unchanged at $1.68.    The dollar fell in early New York dealings in the wake of the announcement of a 0.7% rise in U.S. producer prices last month and a 0.4% drop in industrial production. The price rise spurred fear of inflation, and the production drop fanned concern about slow U.S. economic growth.    Economists had forecast respective rises of 0.4% and 0.1%. The producer-price gain was the largest since a 0.8% rise in October 1985, and drop in output was the largest since a 0.4% decline in May 1986.    The dollar fell to a low of about 1.772 marks with the economic report. However, several factors brought the currency up from its nadir, including unsubstantiated rumors that the Federal Reserve intervened to support the dollar.    The dollar also got a boost when major U.S. banks raised their prime rates to 8 1/4% from 8%, and talk spread through the market that the Fed would lift its discount rate.    The dollar's strength against the yen resulted from cross-buying of marks for yen, dealers said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for May delivery jumped $10.60 an ounce to $474.80 in heavy trading estimated at eight million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $477.25 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, May 15, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
