Organizers promise the show and auction will be the ``maddest,the meanest and the prettiest auction.''   Pastor David Eberhard, who also is a member of the Detroit CityCouncil, said he hopes the July 20 sale of the bad-taste pieceswill raise $10,000 for the $2 million project at the historicTrinity Lutheran Church.   Among the ugliest pieces revealed Monday were a bas-relief slabpainted in dull gold depicting what looked like the Greek godPoseidon riding a sea monster. The item once was part of a casino'sdecor.   Also available are a picture of a Hawaiian sunset encased in acheap pseudo-wood frame and a painting of a ``really ugly fish,''said Ron Hoffman, a member of the church's Ugly Art Committee,which solicited the donations.   The fish painting was donated by restaurateur Joe Muer, whosebrother Chuck, also a restaurateur, donated a flower still life,which he bought in Paris in 1964.   Perhaps the least offensive piece is a linen table napkinautographed by opera star Luciano Pavarotti, who sang in Detroitearlier this month. It was donated by committee members F. Edwardand Denise Lucas.</TEXT><DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An affluent suburb trying to spruce up itsneighborhoods is having second thoughts about a law that barspickup trucks from parking overnight in front of homes or indriveways, the mayor says.   Citing a need for ``equity for pickup owners,'' Nichols HillsMayor Mac Maguire said Monday he and other town leaders will use a90-day moratorium to review the ordinance and how it affectsresidents.   The city adopted an ordinance several years ago to prohibitpickup trucks from parking in driveways or in front of homesbetween 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.   At a recent meeting, the city council unanimously agreed to themoratorium because of complaints by residents who owned pickups andhad received tickets for parking illegally outside their homes.   ``I don't think our citizens want the city to look unattractivein any way, but they have a right to protect their property, andthey should have a place to park their vehicles,'' Maguire said.``I think the issue ought to be studied to see if there isn't someway we can achieve what the citizens want.   ``I don't believe we want to penalize citizens on this issue,and I think we should listen to what they want.''   The ordinance's original intent was to prohibit commercialvehicles from parking in front of homes overnight, Maguire said.   But it has forced some residents to ``put their pickup in theirgarage and their Cadillac in the driveway,'' Councilwoman AnnTaylor said.</TEXT></DOC>
