Traders attributed the decline of long-term bonds tohedging activity related to the large slate of corporatebonds sold in recent days, fears of rising inflation andstatements by President Bush. Mr. Bush said at a newsconference that he was more concerned about economic growththan in bringing down long-term interest rates. Bondinvestors are happier when the economy is falling apart andwhen long-term interest rates are declining.</LP><TEXT>   The bond market's bellwether security, the 30-yearTreasury bond, fell more than 5/8 point, a loss of more than$6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The benchmarkbond was quoted late at a price of 100 12/32, down from 1011/32 on Tuesday. The issue's yield, which moves in theopposite direction of its price, rose to 7.95% from 7.90%.   Some analysts believe the yield on the Treasury'slong-term bonds will rise even higher in the days ahead. &quot;Thebig news is that this market is going to shoot through {ayield level of} 8%,&quot; said Peter McTeague, a bond marketanalyst at Technical Data, a Boston research firm.   Mr. McTeague expects interest rates to rise in response totoday's report on February retail sales, which he believeswill be stronger than expected. Evidence of economic strengthis bearish for the bond market because investors assume thegrowth eventually will lead to higher inflation and interestrates.   Such fears prompted some speculators and institutionalinvestors to shed long-term bonds. A Dow Jones CapitalMarkets Report consensus of economists expects that retailsales rose 0.8% in the month and were up 0.4% when sales ofautomobiles are excluded. In January, retail sales with andwithout automobiles rose 0.6%.   &quot;We're right where we were last Thursday, poised before afairly significant economic release,&quot; notes Joseph Liro,senior vice president at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. Indeed, the yieldon the 30-year Treasury bond is close to the level on the eveof last Friday's release of February employment data. Thebond market managed to weather a surprisingly strong jobsreport and rally through Monday before falling back the nexttwo trading sessions.   &quot;Will the market {be able to repeat that performance} ifretail sales are as strong as the employment report wasrelative to expectations? It doesn't feel that way rightnow,&quot; said Mr. Liro.   George Kegler, a senior vice president at A. WebsterDougherty Co. in Philadelphia, said the huge volume ofcorporate bond issuance this week also affected the market.After several weeks of very modest issuance, the new issuevolume suddenly took off this week. According to SecuritiesData Corp., about $3 billion of nonconvertible corporatebonds have been sold so far this week.   &quot;Corporations come to market in droves,&quot; said Mr. Kegler,which sometimes swells dealer inventories. To protect thevalue of the new corporate bonds, which sometimes sit ininventory for several days until they are sold to investors,dealers often hedge their portfolios against market changes.This often is done by selling short Treasury securities.   The most notable feature of yesterday's trading action wasthe unwinding of &quot;curve-flattening&quot; positions, where dealerswere positioned to profit if the gap, called a spread,between yields on short-term and long-term securitiesnarrows. That position was profitable until yesterday. Asyields on long-term securities rose yesterday while yields onshort-term securities declined, the spread widened anddealers decided to cash out.   Traders say there were large buyers of two-year notes andsellers of 30-year bonds, booking profits that have accruedas short-term yields rose faster than long-term yields in thepast two weeks. Traders say there were also sellers offive-year notes and buyers of two-year notes.   That explains why two-year notes were among the bestperforming securities in the Treasury market yesterday. Thenotes ended trading at a price of 99 20/32 to yield 5.56%, upslightly from 99 19/32 to yield 5.58%.   Rates on Treasury bills were little changed. The discountrate on three-month bills ended at 4.01% to yield 4.09%,while the rate on six-month bills ended at 4.16% to yield4.29%.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Companies lined up to sell bonds and notes again, boostingthis week's total issuance to more than $3 billion. Thatalready exceeds the roughly $2.9 billion of newnonconvertible corporate debt issued last week, according toSecurities Data Co.   The biggest news in the high-yield market was the approvalof Revco D.S. Inc.'s bankruptcy reorganization plan, endingthe company's Chapter 11 proceedings which began in mid-1988.The news caused prices of Revco's bonds to gyrate. In earlytrading, the drug store chain's 13 1/8% senior subordinatednotes, due in 1994, were quoted at 51 bid, up 1 1/2. Butlater in the day, prices moved down to 49, due toprofit-taking, traders said.   Prices of most other junk bonds generally were down 3/8point.   In the high-grade corporate market, prices ended down 1/4to 1/2, in tandem with U.S. Treasury securities. Among majorissuers yesterday, BankAmerica Corp. sold $500 million ofnotes, priced through underwriters led by Lehman BrothersInc.   The first part of the offering, consisting of $150 millionof floating rate notes, due March 15, 1995, was priced at99.85 to float quarterly at a rate that is 0.30 percentagepoints above the London Interbank Offered Rate. Yesterday,Libor was 4.375%. The noncallable notes will be resetquarterly and will pay interest quarterly. The second part,consisting of $350 million of notes, due March 15, 1997, waspriced to yield 7.659%.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Strong demand from a mix of investors greeted theMassachusetts Convention Center Authority's $162.6 millionoffering of refunding bonds.   Meanwhile, prices of some Massachusetts general obligationbonds slipped about 1/4 point in light trading, postinglosses in line with the rest of the secondary market.Tuesday, the bonds rose as much as 1/2 point on news thatMassachusetts's improving finances could lead to a ratingupgrade later this year.   A Tucker Anthony Inc. group priced the MassachusettsConvention Center issue to yield from 3.80% in 1993 to 6.80%for zero-coupon bonds maturing in 2005.   Demand was especially high for the zero-coupon bondportion of the offering, due to a lack of those securities inthe Massachusetts market, dealers said. The bonds, priced ata deep discount to their par value, pay no interest untilmaturity.   The convention center bonds carry the same ratings asMassachusetts G.O.s: Baa by Moody's Investors Service Inc.and triple-B by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The bonds areconsidered general obligations of Massachusetts because thestate must provide payments, known as contract assistance,equal to the debt service requirements for the bonds.   Meanwhile, a rating downgrade is expected to translateinto higher yields for Monroe County, N.Y., when it sells$121 million of G.O.s in a competitive sale today. Moody'slowered its rating on the bonds to single-A-1 from double-A,citing the county's &quot;inaccurate budget estimates and afailure to take timely action to offset cuts in state aid andlower-than-budgeted sales tax revenues.&quot;                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          The real estate mortgage investment conduit sector of themarket saw one of its bigger days as underwriters announced$1.9 billion of new securities.   However, despite the four new deals and the increase ofone outstanding offering, volume of new Remics generally hasbeen declining. That is the result of a flattening Treasuryyield curve and tight spreads between mortgage securities andTreasury notes.   A flatter yield curve -- with short-term rates rising morethan bond yields -- takes some of the incentive away fromunderwriting Remics because most classes of these deals aretied to short-term Treasurys. Tighter yield spreads ofmortgage securities above Treasury notes also makes it lessadvantageous to create Remics, as the collateral for Remicdeals becomes more expensive compared with Treasurys.   With issuance more limited, the available Remic supply isbeing readily absorbed by investors, dealers say.   In secondary mortgage securities trading, GovernmentNational Mortgage Association 8% securities for Marchdelivery fell 17/32 to 99, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.Gold 8% securities dropped 15/32 to 98 21/32 and FederalNational Mortgage Association 8% securities declined 15/32 to98 23/32.</TEXT></DOC>
