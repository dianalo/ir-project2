 Thecapability of each central processing unit (CPU) to do a singletask well is at the root of client-server computing.andP;  Freed fromthe responsibilities of database management, microcomputerworkstations have the power to incorporate graphical userinterfaces with data-intensive applications.andP;  Using theclient-server model, 'decision-support systems' can be designed bysystems integrators, accessing host-driven data to provide forinter-application exchange of data.andP;  A structured query language(SQL) LAN database server combined with decision-support softwarewill also facilitate the downsizing of SQL mini/mainframeapplications.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer systems integratorsLocal Area NetworksClient/Server ArchitectureMarketing StrategyData Base Management SystemsNetwork Operating Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>If networking was the buzzword of the '80s, then database servers or, morespecifically, client-server computing is the tag line of opportunity in the90s.andM;Client-server computing will determine the success of networking in thedecade ahead.andP;  Users are turning away from resellers who supply just anetwork operating system for PC connectivity.andP;  They're looking to theirminicomputer and mainframe vendors, hoping to protect their installed systemswhile planning their enterprise models.andM;Users will look to the database management system as the vehicle forcomputing to the same extent they evaluate the features of a networkoperating system (NOS).andP;  In fact, the DBMS will often determine a customer'schoice of NOS.andM;Challenge and chanceandM;The real challenge for network systems integrators is to develop theorganizations that will offer the technical skills needed to take advantageof the DBMS and apply it to today's heterogeneous computing environment.andP;  Sofar, Fortune 500 companies are the leaders in client-server computing,primarily because of their heavy investment in mini/mainframe databasesystems and application software.andP;  Systems integrators have the opportunityto design and implement &quot;decision-support systems&quot; against the client-servermodel.andM;Decision support is the movement of critical financial data from applicationsthroughout an installed base of mini or mainframe database servers to aSQL-structured (query language) driven LAN database server.andP;  The LANknowledge worker&quot; makes SQL calls to the mini or mainframe and retrieves thequery for importation into their particular productivity-software packages.andO;Decision-support systems provide MIS (management information system)personnel a way to protect their installed base of mainframe and minicomputerapplication software, while continuing to plan for the implementation of theclient-server model.andM;The NOS vendors of the 1980s are aware of the opportunities DBMS areoffering.andP;  Novell has recently acquired an interest in Gupta; Microsoft andApple have established a relationship with Sybase; IBM is now shipping OS/2Extended Edition; and Banyan has offered hooks into its Vines NOS withOracle.andM;The focus shiftsandM;Networking in the 1980s was driven by more narrowly focused companies whobuilt the industry from their own vision of departmental and enterprisecomputing.andP;  These NOS vendors concentrated primarily in delivery anddistribution of MS-DOS files to address print, communication and file-sharingservices.andP;  It was only a few years ago that resellers were touting theirability to design, implement and install local area networks.andM;Yet, resellers mostly specialized in a single NOS.andP;  End-user applicationsconsisted primarily of WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3 or dbase III.andP;  Following thepeddling hype of the NOS vendors, the resellers marketed the specificfeatures of the NOS as if they held the solution for end-user computing.andM;Reaching oems platformsandM;The industry has matured, and driven by customer demand, it is now addressingnetworking standards and the important requirement of interoperability acrossheterogeneous computing platforms.andM;Today, many resellers who had built a computer business by narrowly focusingon networking as their niche are faced with the bigger challenge ofdeveloping and building a network systems integration business.andM;The principal behind client-server computing is to have each CPU do one taskvery well.andP;  PC-based workstations running data-intensive applications-andfreed from the heavy requirements of database management-have the horsepowerto drive intuitive and sophisticated graphical user interfaces (GUIs), whilepreserving the integrity of personal productivity packages.andM;Applying decision-support software with a SQL LAN database server willprovide the foundation for the changes we'll see as we opt for PCs as thedesktop workstation of choice.andP;  Decision-support software will be the firstimplementation end-users develop under the PC client-server model.andP;  This willbe the foundation for true downsizing of SQL mini/mainframe applications.andM;Downsizing, the movement of mini/ mainframe-based applications to the LANdatabase server, will provide the biggest challenge and opportunity fornetwork systems integrators and businessmen.andP;  Downsizing to a LAN databaseserver protects investment in PC hardware platforms, yet it offers thesecurity and performance of earlier mini/ mainframe based systems.andM;The economics of downsizing will fuel the growth of this opportunity.andO;Corporate America will find application design and development less expensivethan with COBOL-driven systems.andP;  The advent of Windows 3.0, with its DDE(dynamic data exchange), completes the picture of downsizing anddecision-support systems.andP;  End-users now have access to host-driven data andthe ability to provide for inter-application data exchange.andM;Kenneth G. Banks is founder and president of IPC Technologies Inc., anetworking systems integrator in Richmond, VA.andP;  He has served on Dest Corp.,andO;Kurzweil Computer Products Inc., NBI Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. dealerscouncils.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
