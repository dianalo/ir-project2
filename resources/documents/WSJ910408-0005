With Kuwait gearing up for a massive reconstructioneffort, U.S. lawmakers are insisting that the emir withdrawfrom the decades-old boycott, which, among other things, barsAmerican companies that do business in Israel from commercein Arab countries. Several senators circulated a lettercalling on Kuwait to make &quot;a significant gesture toward peacein the region&quot; by dropping its participation in the boycott.In just five hours, they collected signatures from 80 oftheir colleagues.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James Baker arrives in theMiddle East later today to try to coax Arabs and Israelisinto taking a series of small, so-called&quot;confidence-building&quot; measures to build a foundation forpeace talks. One proposal, which Mr. Baker broached in SaudiArabia during a trip last month, asks Arab states partiallyto end the boycott in exchange for some positive steps byIsrael concerning the Palestinian problem.   &quot;There is a general willingness, I think, on the part ofboth sides to consider confidence-building measures,&quot; Mr.Baker said as he headed for the Mideast. He added, however,that both sides must be willing to take such stepssimultaneously in order for the process to work. So far,neither side in the Arab-Israeli dispute has been willing tomake the first move.   Some of Israel's supporters here say the partial liftingof the Arab boycott would be a logical first step. &quot;It is ourfeeling that this is a particularly ripe time for moving onthe boycott issue as a confidence-building measure,&quot; assertsJess Hordes, Washington Director of the Anti-DefamationLeague, which strongly opposes the boycott.   Focusing on the boycott takes the political spotlight offIsrael, where hardliners remain unwilling to make anymeaningful gesture toward the Palestinians. But evenimpartial experts still say this would be an appropriate timeto press the issue. While previous peace-making effortsfocused on Israeli-Palestinian relations, the currentapproach places more emphasis on efforts involving Israel andArab states. That makes the boycott a relevantconfidence-building measure.   The focus on partly ending the boycott stands a betterchance than previous attempts to eliminate it entirely. Mr.Baker is proposing only that Arab states lift a secondaryboycott that prohibits U.S. and other foreign companies fromcommerce with Arab states if those companies do business withIsrael. That would leave in place the original boycott, whichforbids Arab companies from doing business in Israel and barsimports of Israeli products to Arab nations.   The current approach would provide political cover to Arabstates, as they could maintain the primary boycott until theIsraeli-Palestinian issue is totally resolved.   U.S. officials also think it is a propitious time to pressrecently liberated Kuwait. Before the Persian Gulf war,Kuwait was the boycott's strongest Arab proponent. It rankedfirst among Arab states in requests for information from U.S.companies about their activities with Israel, even though itranked only fifth among Arab states in overall trade with theU.S., according to Joe Kamalick, publisher of the Boycott LawBulletin.   During a recent visit to Kuwait, Democratic Sen. JosephLieberman of Connecticut was told that U.S. companies, whichare prohibited by U.S. law from complying with many aspectsof the boycott, wouldn't have any problems doing business inKuwait. Mr. Kamalick confirms that as Kuwait begins lettingcontracts to rebuild its country, it's ignoring boycottprocedures.   The question is, can the Kuwaitis be persuaded to make apositive, peaceful gesture by easing the boycott explicitly,or will they depart from the trade ban only for their ownconvenience?   Vincent Rocque, a Washington attorney who is an expert onboycott issues, says, &quot;I don't chalk up Kuwait's new attitudeto an anti-boycott policy. I chalk it up to expediency.&quot;Kuwaitis are eager to reconstruct their nation, and theyrealize that enforcing the boycott makes for bad publicrelations and could deprive them of desperately neededservices.   Mr. Rocque believes that the first confidence-buildingstep the Arabs could take would be to eliminate the blacklistof companies that do business with Israel.   &quot;That would help the Israelis because it . . . would helpremove the chilling effect on companies in third countries,including the U.S., from doing business or investing inIsrael,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
