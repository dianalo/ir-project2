Today, Telman Gdlyan is in trouble with the Supreme Court forjailing a scientist who died in prison. And the country's highestexecutive power said Saturday he is interfering with aninvestigation of alleged abuses of power.   But Gdlyan's fellow investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, has chargedthe two are running into trouble because their investigations aremaking high-ranking officials squirm.   The controversy gripping Gdlyan is a lesson both in rapidlychanging Soviet electoral politics and in President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's effort to make his country one ruled by law rather thanpersonal dictate.   Gdlyan, a 49-year-old senior investigator with the prosecutorgeneral's office, last year exposed a corruption scandal in therepublic of Uzbekistan that brought him national attention.   An article on the scandal, written by Gdlyan and Ivanov andpublished in Ogonyok magazine, caused uproar at the Communist Partyconference in June and turned the two into national heroes.   Several months later, a criminal investigation began and led tothe conviction of Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former Sovietleader Leonid I. Brezhnev, on charges of accepting bribes. He wassentenced to 12 years in a labor camp.   Gdlyan capitalized on his popularity in March congressionalelections _ the country's first multicandidate nationwide ballot in70 years. Voters in Moscow's Tushinsky district swept him intooffice with 86.6 percent of the vote.   The balloting was marked by a strong anti-establishment streak.Boris Yeltsin's reformist campaign garnered 89 percent of Moscowballots, and disgruntled voters in Leningrad and Kiev voted againstgovernment and party leaders.   But in a statement published Saturday, the Presidium of theSupreme Soviet, the country's highest executive body, came downhard on Ivanov and Gdlyan.   The statement in the Communist Party daily Pravda accused theprosecutors of making provocative statements in meetings and in themedia about alleged violations of law by Soviet leaders.   It said the investigtors' statements were designed to``disorient people and interfere in the work of a specially formedcommission ... to verify the numerous ... complaints of citizensabout abuses by Gdlyan and Ivanov in carrying out theirinvestigative work.''   On May 7, the Supreme Court said it found systematic abuse inGdlyan's handling of an investigation into prominent Estonianscientist, I.A. Hint. The 67-year-old scientist, who won theprestigious Lenin Prize, was convicted in 1983 of bribery, theft,and smuggling. He suffered from a cardiovascular illness and diedin jail.   Gorbachev, a lawyer by training, has encouraged the Sovietcourts to take on controversial issues that in the past they rarelytouched. He has demanded the legal system be strengthened toprevent a return to rule by personal dictate, characterized by theleadership of Josef Stalin.   The Supreme Court overturned Hint's conviction and questionedwhether Gdlyan should keep his job based upon charges he refused tohear Hint's arguments and denied him access to a lawyer. WhenHint's wife died shortly after his arrest, the scientist was nottold.   The court charged Gdlyan showed ``an anti-humanistic characteralien to Soviet criminal procedure and a cruel relation to theaccused.''   In an April 29 issue of the popular weekly, Arguments and Facts,Ivanov said high-ranking opponents were responsible for attacks onthem.   ``Efforts to shield participants, compromise investigators,endless `verifications' ... are links of the same chain, havinglittle to do with the idea of creating a a government based onlaw,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
