In opening statements at the fraud and conspiracy trial ofRecognition Equipment Inc. and two of its top officers, AssistantU.S. Attorney Joseph Valder said the firm's chief executiveofficer, William Moore, became ``obsessed'' with getting a majorpostal contract.   In an attempt to achieve his goal, said the prosecutor, Mooreand his co-defendant, REI Vice President for Marketing RobertReedy, sought help from Peter Voss, a member of the postalservice's board of governors.   At Voss' urging, REI hired a small consulting firm headed byDetroit-area businessman John Gnau, Valder said. REI arranged topay $325,000 to Gnau's firm in little more than a year, theprosecutor said, with a portion of the proceeds being funneled toVoss.   ``This case is not about aggressive-but-legal businesspractices,'' said Valder. ``It's about the fact that'' Moore andReedy ``cheated ... they lied ... they stole ... they covered up.''   ``The case is about Moore and Reedy blocking governmentfunctions by deceit,'' Valder said.   Moore and Reedy were involved in a scheme to ``defraud thegovernment by buying a governor,'' he said.   Voss, who headed Ronald Reagan's 1980 Ohio presidentialcampaign, received a four-year sentence in 1986 after pleadingguilty to taking an illegal gratuity and to expense account fraud.   Gnau, who headed Reagan's 1980 Michigan campaign, was sentencedto three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal $2,500 gratuityto Voss.   The case is being heard by U.S. District Court Judge GeorgeRevercomb because attorneys for REI, Moore and Reedy waived theirclients' constitutional right to a jury trial.   Jenny Haynes Barker, REI vice president, said the case is socomplicated that it would best be handled by a judge.   If convicted, Moore and Reedy would each face a maximum of 33years' imprisonment and $1.5 million in fines. Both men are on paidleaves of absence. They have maintained their innocence and saythey plan to return to their former jobs if exonerated.   A seven-count indictment in October 1988 followed aninvestigation by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and a federalgrand jury into details of competition for a computer automationcontract with the postal service.</TEXT></DOC>
