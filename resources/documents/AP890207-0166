Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., told the House before itvoted 380-48 to reject the 51 percent raise and the Senate followedsuit, 94-6.   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee remindedcolleagues, ``The hardest thing you do is tell your families thatthey must sacrifice year in and year out.''   ``Sure there are perquisites that come with the job,'' he said,his voice rising. ``But you know as well as I do that perks can'tmake up for the birthdays, ball games, holidays and meals that wemiss. When was the last time you skipped a town meeting for a schoolplay? If you can't remember, ask your spouse.   ``You maintain two households but you're never home.''   The House majority whip, Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., saidCongress was ``engaged in an action that is surely self-defeating.''   By not taking the raise and coupling the increase witheliminating honoraria, Coelho said, Congress would continue ``asystem of compensation that revolves around special interest money.This is no victory. It is a loss for the concept of leadership.''   ``The score is easy to read: Ralph Nader 1, national interest0,'' Coelho added, referring to the consumer advocate who was anoutspoken opponent of the raise, which had been proposed by apresidential commission and supported both by Ronald Reagan andPresident Bush.   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., joined other speakers inpredicting that federal executives and judges would leave federalservice without more money.   Countering arguments that judicial candidates are waiting in lineto be nominated, Early said, ``Our concern should be who's in line.''   He criticized colleagues for making re-election ``more importantin this House than anything else.'' The most important thing, hesaid, is ``long-range good government.''   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., introduced the resolution to reject theraise but said he did so only to ``face reality.'' He then votedagainst his own rejection resolution.   He said that despite support from Common Cause, the self-styledcitizens' lobby, ``We fell prey to the deception of the rabblerousers. We became cartoon cannon fodder for trash television andtalk radio.''   He added, ``There are Supreme Court justices who make less thantheir clerks the day after they (the clerks) retire and go intoprivate practice.''</TEXT></DOC>
