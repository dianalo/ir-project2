The first group of studies cover the handlingof alarms, surveillance and control of the reactor core, plant faultdiagnosis, reliability of software and computer-aided operator manual.As a result of those investigations, the HALO (handling of alarms usinglogic) concept was developed at Halden and the SCORPIO (surveillanceof a reactor core by picture on-line display) project was started in1979 to integrate the large volume of study results obtained from theHalden Project. Development of an early fault detection (EFD) systemhas been conducted since 1985. Efforts are under way to develop a diagnosissystem for the Halden Project by applying a fault diagnosis expert system,or DISKET, which was developed by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute.For reliability of software, studies are being performed concerning thepossibility of occurrence of a defect in a program (Project on DiverseSoftware, or PODS) and software testing and evaluation methods (STEM).For studies on man-machine interactions, an experiment control room calledHalden Man-Machine Laboratory was constructed.
