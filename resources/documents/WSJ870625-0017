Years of neglect had produced planes that couldn't fly for want of spare parts, ships that couldn't leave port, a Rapid Deployment Force that was neither rapid nor very deployable and wasn't much of a force.&quot;    --President Reagan's radio address    May 9, 1987   WASHINGTON -- Actually, the Rapid Deployment Force -- a plan to speed U.S. forces to remote crises such as in the Middle East -- is still in trouble, thanks to political pressures applied during the Reagan administration to generate military contracts for a trouble-prone company called Wedtech Corp.    Wedtech, a manufacturing concern based in the Bronx, was supposed to provide barge-like floating causeways to resupply Navy and Marine forces from offshore. But the company wasn't up to the job, which it won through help from Washington supporters including former White House adviser Lyn Nofziger and the Small Business Administration. Chronic delivery delays forced the Pentagon in 1985 to quietly downgrade Marine amphibious-landing capabilities for the Rapid Deployment Force.    &quot;The problem is not right yet,&quot; asserts Robert W. Kesteloot, a retired Navy captain who until last year headed the Navy's strategic sealift program. Capt. Kesteloot says the Navy is still chronically short of causeways, and he blames the troubles on the SBA, where officials were insisting that Wedtech should make the units, until the company filed for protection under the Bankruptcy Code last December.    &quot;It was a very frustrating time for the Navy,&quot; Capt. Kesteloot says. &quot;We just felt like our hands were tied.&quot;    Investigations now are under way into how Wedtech got both the Navy and the SBA to bend programs and policies in its favor. Documents under review by congressional investigators and Independent Counsel James McKay show that, despite the Navy's initial objections, Wedtech received noncompetitive contracts to build $135 million of the floating causeways. The first contract, in late 1983, was the largest ever given to a company under an SBA program that earmarks federal contracts for minority controlled companies. (An SBA spokesman says that none of its officials can talk about Wedtech because the company is being investigated.)    Until its bankruptcy-law filing, Wedtech seemed to have a limitless ability to overcome daunting problems. Even before the company received its first Navy contract in December 1983, it was under fire within the SBA minority program because it had gone public and no longer appeared to be under the control of John Mariotta, a man of Puerto Rican ancestry who founded the company in the early 1970s.    The problem was resolved, however, when Wedtech lawyers drew up an escrow agreement under which major stockholders put their holdings in a trust controlled by Mr. Mariotta. Although Mr. Mariotta put up no money for the deal, it was soon blessed by the SBA. Mr. Mariotta was recently charged by a federal grand jury in New York with defrauding the SBA through the arrangement, which federal prosecutors called a &quot;sham.&quot; Mr. Mariotta's attorney claims his client was used as a figurehead by other company officials in the transaction.    Wedtech's next obstacle was a much bigger one: Adm. T.J. Hughes, a deputy chief of naval operations, began complaining that Wedtech was incapable of building the causeways, which are 100-ton, bargelike units that can be connected like floating highways or pulled in series to carry freight from ships in deep water to beaches. According to shipbuilding industry executives, the causeways are the most easily built ships in the Navy.    The units were needed for the Pentagon's Rapid Deployment Force, whose purpose, as espoused by both the Carter and Reagan administrations, is to give the U.S. the capability to quickly deploy military units in the early stages of a crisis. The force would employ airborne and seaborne assault troops that would be backed up within five days by prepositioned stocks of ammunition, food, gasoline and military hardware.    The causeways are used to deliver the supplies from Navy-leased vessels, called MPS ships, that would be stationed near the area of expected conflict. But by early 1985, Adm. Hughes was complaining that the Navy had delayed deployment of the first of three squadrons of MPS ships because Wedtech had fallen a full year behind in its production schedule. That, he asserted, left the Marine Corps with half a billion dollars of newly purchased equipment that couldn't be unloaded within the critical five-day period because it didn't have enough causeways.    In a May 1985 memo to Everett Pyatt, an assistant secretary of the Navy who heads the service's shipbuilding program, Adm. Hughes stressed that the Navy was facing &quot;a very real degradation of our sealift offload capability.&quot; In order to patch together one five-ship MPS task force for the Middle East, the Navy had to delay another unit destined for Europe and also diverted causeways being sent to Marine assault units, he said. He urged Mr. Pyatt to find another company to build the causeways.    Two months later, Mr. Pyatt announced that he was awarding another causeway contract to Wedtech. According to documents later obtained by the House Small Business Committee, two lobbyists for Wedtech, Mr. Nofziger, former political counselor to President Reagan, and an associate, Mark Bragg, were frequent callers at Mr. Pyatt's office.    Lawyers for Mr. Nofziger and Mr. Bragg assert that such contacts were legal. Navy spokesmen say that neither Mr. Pyatt nor Adm. Hughes would comment because the matter is under investigation.    The Navy memos said that Mr. Pyatt had insisted &quot;on hanging in there&quot; with Wedtech and that meant Navy engineers were faced with the task of &quot;prodding, nurturing, advising, threatening a company with zero marine construction capacity . . .&quot;    Wedtech currently is being investigated by grand juries in Washington, Baltimore and New York. Among its attempts to make connections, the company is accused by a federal grand jury in Baltimore of funneling money to two nephews of the former head of the House Small Business Committee, Rep. Parren Mitchell, (D., Md.), in an effort to impede a congressional inquiry. Mr. Mitchell, who resigned from Congress last year, repeatedly prodded the SBA to investigate Wedtech, beginning in July 1984.    Two other Wedtech operatives, E. Robert Wallach, a lobbyist for the company, and W. Franklyn Chinn, a San Francisco investment counselor and former director of Wedtech, have ties to Attorney General Edwin Meese. Mr. Wallach has been a confidant of Mr. Meese since law school. Mr. Chinn established a trust, which has since been dissolved, to hold investments of Mr. Meese and his wife.    Both Mr. Wallach and Mr. Chinn, who received large amounts of stock from Wedtech, deny any wrongdoing.    Investigators haven't developed a direct tie between the Navy causeway contract and Mr. Meese, who has admitted helping Wedtech get a &quot;fair hearing&quot; on an earlier SBA-processed contract that the company was awarded by the Army. Mr. Meese recently asked that his actions regarding that contract be investigated by Mr. McKay, the independent counsel.    One early casualty of the Wedtech inquiries is likely to be the special SBA program for minority small-businesses. Congress currently is considering such changes as increasing the current $50,000 fine for defrauding the SBA and limiting the size of government contracts that the SBA can set aside for a minority owned company. &quot;I'm not interested in making minority companies Fortune 500 businesses,&quot; says House Small Business Chairman John LaFalce, (D., N.Y.).    ---             Wedtech's Military Business 1976-86         SERVICE                              AMOUNT         Navy                             $135,495,493         Army                              106,621,369         Air Force                           3,243,136   Note: All contracts were awarded noncompetitively underthe Small Business Administration's 8(a) program forcompanies owned by &quot;socially and economically disadvantagedpersons.&quot;   Source: Small Business Administration</TEXT></DOC>
