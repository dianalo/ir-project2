The streamlining by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took effectlast month and was aimed at encouraging electric utilities to buildnew nuclear stations.   No new nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978, in partbecause of a lengthy licensing process that sometimes has stretchedfor 13 years. Lando Zech Jr., the NRC chairman, has said the newprocess can cut the licensing time to six years.   Anti-nuclear groups contend the rule changes unfairly limitpublic participation in the NRC licensing process.   ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is attempting to create afuture for the nuclear industry by removing the public's voice inreactor licensing,'' said Michael Marriotte, executive director ofthe Nuclear Information and Resource Service.   Mariotte's group, which is a party to the suit filed in the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, said the NRC revisionsviolate the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, which requires the opportunityfor two public hearings _ one before issuing a construction permitand another before granting an operating license.   The NRC, which formally adopted its rule change April 18, says itadheres to the Atomic Energy Act because it allows the possibilityof a second public hearing, although only under certaincircumstances controlled by the NRC.   Bills have been introduced in Congress to put the NRC changes onthe statutes but no action appears likely this year.   Robert Polland of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which alsois a party to the lawsuit, said his group favored efforts to resolveimportant licensing issues before the start of plant construction.But he said the new NRC rule goes too far in trying to settle allissues before the public is fully aware of a plant builder's plans.   The other groups joining the lawsuit are Public Citizen, theCommittee to Bridge the Gap, the New England Coalition on NuclearPollution, the Sinnissippi Alliance for the Environment, the EnergyResearch Foundation and the Citizens for Responsible Energy.</TEXT></DOC>
