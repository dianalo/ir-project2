About 50,000 people gathered in suburban Rangoon on the westbank of Inya Lake, where opposition groups say police killed andbrutally assaulted students during demonstrations March 17.   Meanwhile, residents of a Rangoon suburb said today at least 20people, including two Buddhist monks, died during a confrontationbetween looters in a government biscuit factory and members of a``vigilence committee.''   ``Vigilence committees'' are among the informal groups formed tomaintain order and handle routine administration in areas where thegovernment has been ineffective in wake of anti-government protests.   Residents said members of the ``vigilence committee'' rushed tothe biscuit factory Sunday in South Okkalapa to stop a reportedtheft but instead were captured by the looters.   Residents surged into the factory and, discovering eight membersof the committee had been killed, set upon the thieves. The mobreportedly killed 12 people.   Also today, the All Burma Students Union printed what it saidwas an official directive to military intelligence agents and theirinformers.   ``Under prevailing conditions in the country, intelligence unitsand their informers must use various methods to cause fear andconfusion among the public,'' said the directive.   A newsletter published by the students union said the directivewas issued Aug. 22 by the head of military intelligence. Theauthenticity of the directive could not be independently verified.   Some Western diplomats in Rangoon have speculated the governmentis trying to push the country toward anarchy to justify a militarytakeover.   At least six armed officers identified as members of militaryintelligence were apprehended by protesters last month andreportedly acknowledged being ordered to carry out bombings andother sabotage to create chaos.   Meanwhile, about 400 employees of the state radio and television_ the last major media under full official control _ went on striketoday to protest the suspension of 14 colleagues.   ``Our strike can greatly disrupt normal operations, but they cango on with a skeleton staff,'' strikers in the Information andBroadcasting Department said. The department has about 650employees.   The 14 officials were suspended for taking part inanti-government protests last month.   The March violence inflamed a public already disillusioned withpolitical repression and economic deterioration. Another majordemonstration flared in June and unrest has continued over the pasttwo months.   ``My young sons and daughters whose names I had no chance toknow,'' said opposition leader Aung Gyi, addressing the studentskilled in March. ``Your courage and sacrifice for the cause ofdemocracy has been recognized, and you all will be remembered asmartyrs of democracy both in the history of Burma and abroad.''   Referring to those killed by military forces last month, theretired general said: ``Thousands from various walks of life _monks, students, workers, doctors and nurses _ have also followedyou for the same cause.''   The opposition has called for a nationwide strike Thursday topress the government for immediate democracy rather than wait for acongress of the ruling party Sept. 12. President Maung Maung haspromised the congress would pave the way for a multi-party systemafter a referendum is held.   ``The whole country has demanded immediate formation of aninterim government to ease the situation. The government has toface the reality,'' Aung Gyi told visiting Rep. Stephen Solarz,D-N.Y., in Rangoon on Sunday.   Solarz later told reporters in Bangkok, Thailand, that Burma wason the ``dawn of a new era of democracy'' but warned that hardlinegovernment and military moves could still cause a civil war.   ``I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the fate ofBurma hangs in the balance,'' he said.   Solarz suggested the exile of Ne Win, the military leader whoseized power in 1962, and other top government leaders would helpdefuse the situation.   Western diplomats say at least 100 people were killed in theMarch riots, while about 1,000 died last month in the capitalfollowing the retirement of Ne Win and his replacement by hardlinerSein Lwin.   Upon Sein Lwin's accession to power, Aung Gyi and some of hisassociates were arrested and jailed. They were released when SeinLwin was replaced on Aug. 19 by Maung Maung, the first civilianleader in Burma in 26 years.</TEXT></DOC>
