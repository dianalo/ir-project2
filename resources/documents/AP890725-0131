TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BEIT SAHUR, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A dozen Palestinians andIsraelis sat in a circle on a veranda overlooking biblicalShepherds Field, engaging in blunt conversation they hope willchange enmity to trust.   Israeli army trucks rumbled past every few minutes, lendingurgency to the unofficial meeting at the apartment of GhassanAndoni, a physics professor at Bir Zeit University.   ``There is a silent majority in the Israeli public that is notmotivated by ideology but by its fears,'' said Andoni, who had justbeen confined to a tent prison in the desert for 18 days forpolitical activism. ``This could change if we can win their trust,''   An Israeli musician named Dany interrupted to say: ``For 20years this land has been occupied by Israel, yet most Israelis donot know Palestinians and vice versa. When they do meet, it is inunequal situations like at a checkpoint.''   Dany, who is in his 50s, did not give his surname for fear hiscomments would threaten his job.   More than 30 such encounters have occurred in the past yearbetween Palestinians and Israelis, most of them intellectuals orprofessionals.   Beit Sahur, a wealthy Christian town of 10,000, has been a focalpoint of nonviolent civil disobedience. It is where the NewTestament says the birth of Jesus was revealed to shepherds.   The informal meetings are unofficial accompaniment to talksbetween prominent Palestinians and Israeli officials, includingPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, about holding elections in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for Palestinians to negotiatewith Israel.   Exchanges between Israeli leftists and Palestine LiberationOrganization officials have occurred abroad, often in academicforums. The future of such contacts depends on Israel's SupremeCourt, to which four leftists have appealed a law making contactswith the PLO punishable by three years in jail.   On Tuesday, a Palestinian lawyer known as a PLO supporter saidhe had met with Shamir, a contradiction of government claims thatthe prime minister had spoken about his peace plan only withPalestinians not connected with the PLO.   In Beit Sahur, Hebrew University lecturer Sidra Ezrachi recalledthat the conversation group organized a weekend visit by more than50 Israelis to the Arab town and the Israelis brought children,prayer books and kosher food. Palestinians later went to theIsraelis' homes and attended synagogue services.   ``My kids were playing outside, and I suddenly realized that Iwasn't worried about them being here,'' Ms. Ezrachi said.   Publicity, however, also brought two anonymous telephone fromJewish extremists who threatened to kill her family.   Members of the group try to break down each other's stereotypes.That has been difficult, even painful, especially when theconversation turns from personal to the political or from presentto past.   ``At some point we stopped talking about history, about who wasright,'' Ms. Ezrachi said. ``It was too painful.''   Andoni said Palestinians, as a result of the 19-month-olduprising against Israeli occupation, now can approach Israelis asequals and accept the idea of two states, one for Jews and one forArabs.   ``All the time we were trying to de-legitimize the other side bysaying Zionism is racism, that the existence of the Jewish statewas illegal,'' he said. ``In the same way, Israelis accused us ofbeing terrorists, disqualifying us from being a people or needing astate.   ``We realized that Israelis are not going to disappear, and theyrealized Palestinians are not going to go away.''   Many Israelis are reluctant to participate in suchconversations, feeling them inappropriate while the two peoples arein a state of war.   Palestinians fear other Palestinians will see theirparticipation as acceptance of the status quo, and also thatIsraeli officials will try to cast them as substitutes for the PLOin the territories.   Israelis and Palestinians in the Beit Sahur group have come toconsider themselves friends, but tensions linger.   Andoni, who noted with a chuckle that he read part of the JewishTorah in jail, said he was increasingly discouraged by publicopinion polls indicating more hawkish Israeli attitudes. He alsosuffers doubt.   ``I always ask myself, `Am I doing wrong speaking with myvictimizers? Should I speak with the other side while they arekilling our people?''' he said.   After reflection, Andoni added: ``Until now, though, we stillhave the strength to forgive.''   Dany said hawkish Israeli views stem from anti-Israeli violence.   ``It is easy to pull to the extremes when you see what happenedwith the bus,'' he said.   On July 6, a Palestinian seized the steering wheel of an Israelicommuter bus and forced it off the highway into a ravine, killing16 Jews. Twenty-five people were injured.   More than 520 Palestinians have died in confrontations withIsraelis since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, and 38 Israelishave been killed.</TEXT></DOC>
