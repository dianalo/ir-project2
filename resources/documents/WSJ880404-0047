Government figures released Friday showed an unexpectedly large increase in jobs last month and another drop in the nation's unemployment rate. Separately, a survey of corporate purchasing managers provided more signs that inflation remains under control.    Nevertheless, some economists and money managers fear the financial markets are heading into a rough storm because of congressional moves to enact a massive trade bill. Those fears increased late last week after congressional conferees approved most provisions of a trade package.    President Reagan still may veto the proposed legislation. Nevertheless, the bill's advance in Congress already has aroused widespread fears that Japanese investors will react by selling some of their dollar-denominated investments, or at least cutting back on new purchases of U.S. government bonds.    Many analysts agree that the U.S. needs massive infusions of foreign capital to help finance its massive budget and trade deficits. Without such huge amounts of foreign funds, U.S. interest rates will rise, they contend.    &quot;We need foreign countries' capital as much as they need our markets,&quot; said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corp. &quot;Anything that threatens the free flow of capital into this country is very dangerous under the current situation.&quot;    Mr. Soss added: &quot;Once you say to the world, we're your debtor and we need your money but we're not going to allow you to invest it freely in our country, then I think your currency value comes under pressure.&quot;    Several investment managers said protectionism usually spells higher inflation. They reasoned that protectionist measures make it tougher for foreign companies to compete in U.S. markets, thus making it easier for U.S. companies to raise prices.    Historical parallels also trouble some analysts. They say the latest congressional developments bear an eerie resemblance to the debate leading to the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which many say triggered the Great Depression.    &quot;While this trade bill isn't Smoot-Hawley, it's so open-ended that it makes me nervous,&quot; says Alan Reynolds, chief economist of Polyconomics Inc., a Morristown, N.J., consulting firm. &quot;It's open-ended in the sense that it would grant us enormous discretion to be protectionist if we want to be. If I were a foreigner, I'd be mighty scared, especially a foreigner in a country with a trade surplus.&quot;    Mr. Reynolds thinks President Reagan &quot;probably&quot; will veto the measure. But many investors also assumed President Hoover would veto Smoot-Hawley. &quot;People said Hoover would veto Smoot-Hawley because he's not stupid. Well, yes, he was,&quot; Mr. Reynolds said.    The trade bill has raised &quot;a small possibility that it will precipitate a global depression,&quot; Mr. Reynolds contended.    One provision of the trade bill that especially concerns many investment managers involves securities dealers. The provision would bar foreign companies from serving as primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless their governments allow U.S. companies to compete on an equal basis with local firms to handle their government securities.    Some U.S. executives insist this is fair and long overdue. But others are worried because it is aimed primarily at Japanese companies, which have played a major role in helping the U.S. finance its bloated deficits. If the bill is enacted as it now stands, the U.S. units of Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. could lose their highly valued primary dealer status within a year.    The proposed legislation comes at an especially bad time because the U.S. financial industry is &quot;in such disarray,&quot; said Wayne F. Wong, managing director for fixed income management at Marinvest Inc., a subsidiary of Marine Midland Banks Inc. &quot;A lot of American firms lost so much money in the crash. The only people to inject a significant amount of capital are the Japanese, so we shouldn't prohibit them&quot; from becoming primary dealers. &quot;We should welcome them.&quot;    Regardless of what happens in the legislative battle, some securities specialists predict Japanese life insurance companies will begin selling dollar bonds and stocks because of concern that the dollar will drop further.    Still, the U.S. economy's performance this year continues to impress many investors both here and abroad. The Labor Department's March survey showed the number of workers on business payrolls rose 262,000 last month. That was higher than the 200,000 estimate of many private economists. The civilian jobless rate fell to 5.6% from 5.7%.    Although the report showed more strength than had been generally expected, Mr. Reynolds of Polyconomics said there isn't any reason for concern about inflation. &quot;There are a lot of jobs out there but there is no objective evidence of inflation,&quot; he said. He added that it would be a mistake to expect the Federal Reserve to change its credit policy anytime soon.    But Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, disagreed. He predicted the Fed &quot;is going to take back the little easing&quot; move it made earlier this year in response to signs at the time that the economy looked weak.    As a result, Mr. Fine expects the federal funds rate to climb back up to about 6 3/4%, which is where it stood earlier this year before the Fed eased credit. Recently, the rate on funds, or overnight loans between banks, has averaged approximately 6 1/2% to 6 5/8%.    &quot;It's very difficult to envision any sort of weakening in the economy if construction is going to pick up, as these construction employment figures suggest,&quot; Mr. Fine said. He also contended that economic growth this quarter will be &quot;even stronger&quot; than in the first quarter. &quot;I would imagine under the circumstances the Fed would want to pull back a little.&quot;    The credit markets were closed here Friday in observance of Good Friday. Asked how the bond markets are likely to react today to the employment report, Mr. Fine replied: &quot;My guess is bonds will drop in price.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
