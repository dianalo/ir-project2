Many experts believe the current Polish unrest, coinciding with economic and political problems throughout Eastern Europe, marks the beginning of a refocusing of U.S. and Soviet interests to Europe from today's distant guerrilla conflicts. Soviet retrenchment from costly foreign adventures, signaled by the planned Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and new flexibility on Angola, will transfer Moscow's energies to the core area of its external fears, Eastern Europe, and of its foreign ambitions, Western Europe.    &quot;The U.S.-Soviet competition is shifting from the Third World to Europe,&quot; says William Griffiths, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former consultant to the U.S. Embassy in Bonn. He says unrest in East Europe poses the greatest threat to Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to open up the Soviet economy and society.    &quot;The danger the Soviets face is how do they gain Western Europe and not lose Eastern Europe,&quot; he says. Western Europe is central to Moscow's long-term goal of eroding U.S. influence and its immediate need for financing and technology.    Sensing this shift in the East-West struggle, Rep. Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat, urges a less-passive allied policy that would offer carrots to East European countries to encourage closer ties with the West.    &quot;Over the next several years, Eastern Europe will become increasingly important for American policy,&quot; he says. &quot;Poland, the most open country in Eastern Europe, faces severe problems of economic and political stability. Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany and Czechoslovakia will face leadership changes as well as strong pressures for political and economic change. Albania is likely to emerge from its isolation.&quot;    Dmitri Simes of the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace believes the U.S. should seize the opportunity and propose to the Soviets a joint declaration on European security under which both promise not to interfere militarily unless their allies are invaded. If Mr. Gorbachev refuses, it reveals Moscow's intention to continue preserving empire by military force. If he agrees, the U.S. will be lauded by East Europeans for the achievement. &quot;You are showing what Gorbachev really is,&quot; says Mr. Simes.    As so often in the past, the first round is being played out in Poland, where security forces last week stormed a steel mill near Krakow to crush a 10-day strike that had set off a wave of labor unrest. The strikes come at a sensitive time: Washington and Moscow are preparing for the Memorial Day summit and Mr. Gorbachev is already under fire from Communist Party conservatives for running too loose a ship.    Most dangerous to Mr. Gorbachev, the East European troubles aren't purely Polish. Demonstrations have occurred this year in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania. East European economies are stagnating, nationalist and religious feeling is growing and nonofficial organizations are proliferating.    &quot;This is no longer a single challenge in a single country,&quot; says Sarah Terry, an expert on East Europe at Tufts University. &quot;Gorbachev may find himself facing simultaneous challenges in several countries. The potential of unrest in Eastern Europe hangs like a sword of Damocles over Gorbachev's policies of perestroika {economic restructuring} at home.&quot;    All this has been helped along by Soviet agreement to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, which many East European dissidents read as the first sign of Soviet weakness in Moscow's efforts to spread socialism. An East European diplomat in Washington concedes the withdrawal will have &quot;a rather provocative effect&quot; on dissent throughout the region.    U.S. officials believe unrest in Eastern Europe is a far greater threat to Mr. Gorbachev than recent demonstrations in the Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Those demonstrations didn't question Soviet authority, and indeed sought Kremlin mediation.    Armenians and Azerbaijanis are among the more loyal non-Russian Soviets and haven't shown signs of wanting independence. But many East Europeans view the current period as a time to test the limits of Gorbachev's tolerance for groups that openly challenge the Communist Party's monopoly on power.    &quot;When Gorbachev speaks of democratization, East Europeans know what it means,&quot; says Prof. Terry. &quot;A lot of the Soviet population does not.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
