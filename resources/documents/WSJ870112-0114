One subject will undoubtedly be the OECD's proposed multilateral tax convention. Mr. Mentz's mission ought to be an opportunity to call a halt to this ill-thought-out initiative, which would place the taxpayers of signatory nations in harm's way before the tax collectors of those nations with the highest taxes. Unhappily, the U.S. appears to be ready to support this initiative.    The proposed treaty targets not only tax evasion but also tax avoidance. The distinction between the two is important. Tax evasion is illegal, an abhorrent form of law-breaking. Tax avoidance is legal, providing it doesn't entail fraud. It is also a fundamental process of any market system by which its participants, be they individuals or corporations, go price-shopping for government services. No one has a greater stake than the U.S. in ensuring that this process be allowed to continue, particularly now that the U.S. has enacted the lowest marginal rates in the OECD.    Word that the Reagan administration is fumbling the ball comes in the form of a State Department telegram sent late last year by Secretary of State Shultz to the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Copies are circulating in the OECD capitals. Mr. Shultz reports that Treasury expects to recommend that the U.S. sign the convention and in particular that it accept the information-exchange provisions of the proposed convention. These provisions would allow, or even require, the U.S. to pass on heretofore private tax information to foreign governments, even when no tax crime is being investigated or even alleged.    We have listened to proponents of this treaty. Mr. Shultz calls it a &quot;significant international document that will both encourage and better enable countries to work together in the enforcement of their tax laws.&quot; Its supporters contend that it isn't in the interest of any country to allow the sheltering of funds that the laws of another country would subject to a tax. That all sounds quite nice in the abstract. But we're by no means sure that it's in the interest of the U.S. -- or any other country, for that matter -- to transmit wholesale the private tax information of its residents to competing governments. This is particularly true with governments such as those of Greece and Spain, where tax enforcement is subject to notoriously widespread abuses.    Proponents stress that it wouldn't be used to move against legal tax avoidance but only against illegal activity. The history of such regulatory policing, however, suggests a tendency toward an ever-widening administrative interpretation of what constitutes illegal activity.    The existence of this proposed treaty on taxes ought to tell Europe's politicians that it's time to stand back and take a long, hard look at the economic effects of their current systems. The real problem here is high marginal tax rates in Europe, the arbitrary and politically motivated collection of taxes in some countries, and unjust, economically destructive exchange controls that cause so many people to try to shelter their money in other jurisdictions. The OECD's energies would be far better spent addressing these problems. </TEXT></DOC>
