In a bluntly worded, seven-page statement, the ex-directors reviled at claims that they reneged on a contract by selling Getty Oil twice -- first to Pennzoil Co., then to Texaco. &quot;We never broke our word,&quot; they declared.    The statement brought White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco some public-relations value but no legal assistance in its continuing $10.3 billion battle with Houston-based Pennzoil. Essentially, the statement reiterated 1985 courtroom testimony in which three Getty directors asserted that Pennzoil never reached a merger contract with Getty. Despite that testimony, a Texas state-court jury found that Texaco had improperly induced Getty to turn its back on a binding agreement with Pennzoil, in order to accept a higher-priced offer from Texaco. That history-making court judgment, in turn, moved Texaco last month to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.    But although the former directors offered no revelations about their dealings with Pennzoil and Texaco, it was unusual that they reunited to declare their sentiments about the case. The former directors include some of the nation's most prominent figures of business and academia, such as chief executive officers Laurence Tisch of CBS Inc., Henry Wendt of SmithKline Beckman Corp., John Teets of Greyhound Corp. and Graham Allison Jr., dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.    Equally significant, however, was the absence of two additional ex-directors' names from the list of signatories to the statement -- directors who between them represented 52% of Getty Oil's stock. One is Harold Williams, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who now is president of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif. It was Mr. Williams who, according to notes taken during a 25-hour directors' meeting in January 1984, &quot;moved that the board accept the Pennzoil proposal.&quot;    The other ex-director whose name is absent from the statement is Gordon Getty, trustee for the Getty family's holdings in Getty Oil. In an interview last year, Mr. Getty said that, as a layman, he considered it a &quot;close call&quot; whether Pennzoil had secured a contract.    But among the other 13 former directors, there was absolutely no doubt: &quot;Getty Oil Co. never entered into a binding contract with Pennzoil,&quot; they said.    Texaco said in a news release that the ex-directors' &quot;clear and emphatic statement bears out Texaco's contention -- from the very beginning of this case -- that no Getty-Pennzoil contract ever existed; and that Texaco's acquisition of Getty was the result of the Getty directors' efforts to secure the most favorable deal for Getty's public shareholders and Texaco's willingness to compete by offering better terms -- not tortious interference.&quot;    The 13 former Getty directors' statement wasn't provoked by any single event, but rather by &quot;a building sense of frustration,&quot; said Steven Feirson of Dechert, Price andamp; Rhoads, Philadelphia, a law firm representing most of the ex-directors.    Texaco's Chapter 11 filing did arouse deep distress among the directors, they said. In addition, the filing froze two lawsuits filed by Texaco shareholders against the former Getty directors, making them feel freer to speak publicly. The ex-directors also had their directors-and-officers liability insurance policies revoked, and are suing the carriers as a result.    The statement didn't point out that during their marathon board meeting, the directors voted 15-1 to reach some sort of accommodation with Pennzoil. (One former director is deceased.) Some directors have explained that the vote was intended to approve a merger price with Pennzoil and to continue further merger negotiations -- but not to approve a contract. &quot;We were the ones who were there,&quot; the directors said in the statement. &quot;Each one of us knows what he intended by his vote.&quot;    The directors also suggested that Pennzoil had outfoxed itself in the proceedings by trying to force through a merger at an unfairly low price -- thereby inviting a competing bid from Texaco. &quot;Pennzoil lost Getty Oil for one reason and one reason only,&quot; the statement claimed. &quot;It refused to pay a fair price.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
