Freedman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MO LTR LIG </CO><IN> TOB </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   A federal judge in Newark, N.J., said trial evidence showed the tobacco industry had engaged in a &quot;conspiracy vast in its scope, devious in its purpose and devastating in its results&quot; to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking.    But in rulings that permit the trial of a major tobacco-liability suit to continue here, the judge, H. Lee Sarokin, weakened the case against the companies by dismissing two of the plaintiff's claims.    The trial, which began in February, grew from a suit filed in 1984 against three tobacco companies by the family of the late Rose Cipollone. The suit seeks unspecified damages.    Judge Sarokin dismissed the charge that the companies should have marketed cigarettes less damaging to smokers' health than those they actually did market. Charles R. Wall, a Kansas City, Mo., attorney who represents Philip Morris Cos. and Loews Corp.'s Lorillard division in the case, said, &quot;This isn't a setback at all, but a major victory, because you have had thrown out of the case the major claim of the plaintiff.&quot;    Marc Cohen, a tobacco industry securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. in New York, also called the claims dismissals a victory for the companies. &quot;All this basically did was to strip the case down to one remaining claim against the company,&quot; he said. &quot;The safer-cigarette claim is a major course of action against the cigarette companies that the judge has essentially eliminated. . . . The judge writes very emotional language, but then he gets down into the law and knocks out the claims.&quot;    Also dismissed was the claim by the plaintiff that Philip Morris and Lorillard had failed a legal duty to warn Mrs. Cipollone of the hazards of smoking. Judge Sarokin allowed this claim to stand against a third defendant, Liggett Group Inc., whose Chesterfield and Landamp;M cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone had smoked prior to 1966. In that year federal law began requiring health warnings on cigarette packages. Mrs. Cipollone died of lung cancer in 1984.    Last year, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled that warnings on cigarette packages since 1966 protect the industry from claims that it failed to warn consumers of health hazards.    In harsh words against the companies, Judge Sarokin allowed the trial to continue on claims that the companies illegally conspired to misrepresent the facts about smoking. If the jury finds in favor of the plaintiff, he said, &quot;it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for an award of punitive damages.&quot;    Philip Morris and Lorillard issued a statement criticizing the court for having &quot;embraced the plaintiff's evidence.&quot; Their lawyer, Mr. Wall, said, &quot;I think that in a number of instances he went far beyond what he needed to and did a little editorializing.&quot; But the companies also said, &quot;We are gratified that the court has thrown out most of the plaintiff's claims, including those that go to the heart of this case. We remain confident that we will prevail.&quot;    The evidence, Judge Sarokin said, indicates that &quot;the industry . . . entered into a sophisticated conspiracy . . . organized to refute, undermine and neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical community, and at the same time, to confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence smoking.&quot;    This, he said, &quot;demonstrates a deliberate intent and purpose to challenge all adverse medical and scientific evidence regarding smoking, irrespective of its truth or validity.&quot;    As for the creation in 1954 of the Council for Tobacco Research, the industry's purported &quot;good-faith effort to search for the truth,&quot; Judge Sarokin said that this was &quot;subtle evidence of misrepresentation. . . . It was nothing but a hoax created for public relations purposes, with no intention of seeking the truth or publishing it.&quot;    Despite the dismissal of two claims against the companies, &quot;I don't think that this substantially reduces the chance of a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs in this case,&quot; said Richard Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, a Boston-based group that promotes liability suits against tobacco companies. The group isn't involved in the New Jersey case.    &quot;This may turn out to be an extremely positive development, because all of the tobacco manufacturers were involved in the alleged conspiracy,&quot; Mr. Daynard said. &quot;There is a lot of damning evidence. Now the jury can consider almost all the evidence that came in about defendants' attempts to stonewall and deny.&quot;    Tobacco companies have yet to lose a product-liability suit. About 100 cases are pending.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Philip Morris closed at $86, down 25 cents, on heavy volume of 1.3 million shares. Loews closed at $67.50, down 75 cents, on trading of 253,800 shares, and Liggett closed at $8.25, up 12.5 cents, on trading of 7,200 shares. </TEXT></DOC>
