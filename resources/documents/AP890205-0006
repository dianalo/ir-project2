The reason for dressing up old ideas is that Israel finds itselfconfronting not one, but several dilemmas.   First, Israel's army seems incapable of ending the Palestinianuprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and thegovernment does not want to concede the revolt's goal: anindependent Palestinian state.   Second, the rebellion, along with Arafat's declaration that herecognizes Israel and renounces terrorism, has aroused sympathy frommany abroad and is distancing Israel from allies whose good will anysmall nation needs. This is putting pressure on Israel to come upwith some sort of peace initiative.   Third, short of independence, there seems to be very little newin the way of peace plans that have not already been raised _ andsunk _ since Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip inthe 1967 Six-Day War.   The Rogers plan of 1969, the Begin plan of 1977, the Camp Davidaccords of 1978, the Reagan plan of 1982, the Shultz plan of 1988all have been rejected by one side, the other, or both.   David Bar-Ilan, an Israeli political analyst, outlined Israel's``unenviable position'' at a conference of political scientists andformer government officials here last week.   ``Unless (Israel) finds ways to quell the intefadeh ... it willbe reduced to choosing between two evils: maintaining the status quoand inviting political and diplomatic isolation; or withdrawing tothe '67 lines and allowing a Palestinian state to rise on theoutskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem,'' he said.   Against this background, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir andDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin both recently floated suggestionsthat center on granting autonomy, or limited self-rule, to the 1.7million Palestinians in the occupied lands.   Rabin called for election of local representatives, thenautonomy, and finally negotiations for a final settlement of thestatus of the territories, either in a confederation with Jordan orwith Israel.   Shamir, for the first time directly, said he would be willing topull out Israeli troops from some cities in the occupied lands ifPalestinians would accept autonomy. The end result also would betalks about the final status of the West Bank and Gaza.   While elections and autonomy sound like fine ideas at firstblush, they are not new. Both were brought up in former IsraeliPrime Minister Menachem Begin's peace plan of 1977 and theU.S.-sponsored Camp David accords the following year. The plan fortroop withdrawals from Palestinian cities also comes from Camp David.   The Palestinians were not party to the accords and rejected itssuggestions for autonomy and elections for what they consider goodreasons.   Elections would be for Palestinian representatives in theterritories to negotiate with Israel for a solution. This cuts outthe Palestine Liberation Organization, which most Palestiniansconsider their best representative.   Letting Palestinians run local affairs while Israel keeps controlof security means settling for much less than the Palestinians want:their own country. The word ``autonomy'' also has a bad taste forPalestinians from the way Begin introduced it.   He said that under autonomy, the Israeli army would remainstationed in the West Bank and Gaza. ``We have a right and a demandfor sovereignty over these areas of the land of Israel. This is ourland and it belongs to the Jewish nation rightfully,'' Begin said.   While Shamir and Rabin both said they revived such aged ideas inhopes of unsticking the peace process, others say the moves reallywere intended to remove the tarnish that the uprising and Arafat'snew diplomacy have put on Israel's public image.   Yehuda Litani, Middle East editor of the Jerusalem Post, labeledthe latest Israeli efforts, including meetings by Rabin aides withlocal Palestinian leaders, ``shadowboxing and smoke screens.''   ``The idea is to create the impression among the Americans andperhaps also the West Europeans that Israel is genuinely interestedin finding an interlocutor who can ... achieve agreements acceptableto the Palestinian leadership abroad,'' Litani wrote.   He added: ``The sad fact, however, is that Israel is unable andundoubtedly also unwilling to make far-reaching concessions at thisstage.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   G.G.
