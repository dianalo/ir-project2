U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng told a meeting oftrade and finance ministers from 24 leading industrial nations theU.S. government was ready to ``bite the political bullet'' onagricultural subsidies.   But he added that a U.S. proposal for banning alltrade-distorting farm subsidies by the year 2000 _ made last Juneby President Reagan _ was conditioned on all U.S. trading partnersdoing the same.   ``It is time for all of us to pay more than lip service to thereform of agricultural trade,'' Lyng told the regular springmeeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment.   He likened government use of farm subsidies to the practice ofdumping urban waste in rivers and streams.   ``The economic pollution which results causes all kinds ofinstability and distress, leading inevitably to social andpolitical turmoil,'' he said.   The U.S. farm proposal is opposed by the European EconomicCommunity, which represents 12 European countries on trade issues.   Willy De Clercq, the EEC's top trade official, told the meetingthe U.S. approach was unrealistic. He said the EEC, or CommonMarket, would not budge from its view that short-term reforms inagriculture policy are needed before the longer-term U.S. aims canbe considered.   Farm policy reforms _ including proposals put forth byWashington, the EEC, Canada and others _ are in the early stages ofnegotiation in the Uruguay Round of trade talks in the 96-nationGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The GATT sets and monitorsworld trade rules.   Lyng said the Paris meeting, while not a negotiating forum,should endorse ``a framework for action'' between now and December,when GATT trade ministers will meet to review progress onagricultural and other issues.   After Wednesday's session Lyng told reporters that experts fromthe 24 participating countries would meet overnight to seekagreement on the specific language of a Paris communique to beissued at the close of discussions Thursday.   Asked whether the Reagan administration wanted a specificcommitment from its trading partners to set a target date foreliminating farm subsidies, Lyng declined to comment directly.   ``Our position is clear. You know what our position is, what wetabled in the GATT,'' he said. ``We'd like to see that accepted, orat least a statement consistent with that in the acceptance of along-term objective.''   Jacques Poos, the treasury minister of Luxembourg, said theatmosphere of the debate on farm policy was friendly but yielded noindications that a consensus would be reached.   Michael Wilson, the Canadian finance minister, told reportershis government was pushing hard to find a middle ground betweenWashington and the Europeans.   ``We have very definite positions taken'' by the ``twoextremes,'' he said, adding that Ottawa felt frustrated at the lackof progress in the GATT on agricultural issues.   De Clercq accused the Reagan administration of souring theatmosphere in the GATT farm talks by increasing its subsidies forfarm product exporters seeking to compete with the Common Marketexporters.   An EEC position paper issued at the Paris meeting attacked U.S.farm policy on several fronts and suggested that the U.S. proposalfor eliminating subsidies was little more than a smokescreen. Itsaid the effects of U.S. farm programs were damaging to the worldeconomy.   ``They create an imbalance ... between those who are reformingtheir agricultural policy ... and those who, while parading grandambitions for a distant future, practice day after day a policywhich is likely to lead to confrontation on world markets,'' thepaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
