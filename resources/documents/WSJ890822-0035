He'd better: two of them are paying his new agency, Dick Levy andamp; Associates, largely with equity instead of cash.    Mr. Levy is taking a major gamble that the two clients, both tiny start-up companies, will grow and prosper, or at the very least survive. In the process, he is rushing headlong into a controversial method of payment that other small agencies are looking at carefully, if with some skepticism.    &quot;I think it's wholly worthwhile under the right circumstances,&quot; says Amil Gargano, chairman of ad agency Ally andamp; Gargano. &quot;It makes the agency a partner, and that is very attractive.&quot; But he warns that it doesn't work for every client: &quot;To get no revenue at all and to have everything based on the future, particularly with something that doesn't look like it has a bright future, isn't the kind of thing I'd feel particularly good about.&quot;    For Mr. Levy, the risks are certainly big. The two clients paying him partly with equity are untested companies in difficult fields. His fledgling New York agency has only five clients in total, making their contribution that much more important.    The two clients are Aqua Buoy Corp., which makes a wristwatch-sized gadget that inflates to become a flotation device; and Canadian Mountain Springs, a bottled water company that will have to tackle Evian and Perrier, among others, to be successful.    Both companies have given Mr. Levy's agency a small piece of their businesses -- 1% in one case, slightly more in the other. They also cover costs for creating and placing ads, and pay what he calls a &quot;partial fee.&quot; Says Mr. Levy: &quot;Instead of a sure thing in my pocket, I'm betting on myself and on the company, that it's going to be successful. If the clients get rich . . . I'll make a lot of money, much more than 15%,&quot; the normal agency commission.    Problems can arise, however. Ad agency Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer several years ago took on the Atari computer account in return for Atari stock options as well as a fee that only covered expenses. Messner Vetere worked for almost a year on a campaign to launch a new computer, but the product was never introduced, and the agency resigned the account. &quot;We didn't lose money, but we weren't making any money, and it was so labor- and time-intensive. It just wasn't working out as well as we had hoped,&quot; says Wally Carey, one of the agency's principals.    Still, Mr. Carey says he hasn't soured on the concept altogether. He estimates that about 40% of his agency's clients make payments based on the performance of their products. And he says that he would be happy to consider an equity arrangement with some other client: &quot;At the right time, with the right company and the right product, it can be very attractive.&quot;    Agency executives say the problem with most clients willing to give away equity is that equity is all they want to pay. Mr. Gargano, for example, says his agency turned down a client that wanted to pay only in stock, which he calls &quot;unreasonable.&quot;    Industry executives note that companies willing to pay in equity are usually the ones ad agencies want to avoid -- the ones in the riskiest businesses.    But Mr. Gargano says Ally andamp; Gargano would still like the chance to be given equity as part of payment, and says he has approached &quot;one or two clients over time,&quot; to no avail. He notes that his agency took on both the Federal Express and MCI accounts when those businesses were tiny start-ups. An equity stake in either, he points out wistfully, would have been worth a small fortune today.    ---   Ad Notes. . . .    NEW ASSIGNMENT: General Motors' Oldsmobile division awarded the ad assignment for its Owner Loyalty Direct Marketing program to Leo Burnett Co., Chicago. Billings are estimated at $15 million. The account had been handled by Grey Advertising's direct marketing subsidiary. </TEXT></DOC>
