Loss of material from the surfaces over which these materialspass is caused by the combined effects of impact abrasion, sliding abrasion,and chemical attack. Factors which affect these processes include propertiesof the conveying medium, and properties of the solids, such as particlesize, structural composition, size mix, as well as the velocity of thematerial, the bulk volume of material passing, and the frequency of plantoperation. Guidelines are given for materials selection and the use oflinings in the coal handling plant, pulverized coal pipework, and ashdisposal plant is reviewed for coal-fired power plants.</TEXT></DOC>
