An understanding of thecatalytic mechanism is necessary to provide leads towards this aim. Surfacecharacterization of intermediates in the catalytic steam gasificationof chars have been completed. Mechanisms of gasification with a potassium/nickeloxide catalyst have been illustrated by electron microscopy and kineticsderived from movies taken during the gasification in a CAEM chamber ofthe electron microscope compared with flow reactor kinetics. Comparisonsof chars with graphite have been completed and allow deductions to bemade from graphite to char. Ratios of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxideproduced along with hydrogen have been determined as a function of operatingconditions as well as catalyst and ash composition of the chars. Resultsare discussed. 3 references, 5 figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
