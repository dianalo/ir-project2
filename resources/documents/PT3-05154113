Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to a popcorn popping and dispensing apparatus      adapted for use in combination with a hot air source, the apparatus being      structured and disposed to be insulated from heat loss, be capable of      unmanned, coined operation, and allow for facilitated cleaning thereof,      thereby providing a highly effective, easy to maintain, and easily      regulated popping and dispensing apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Popcorn is a highly enjoyable and often consumed snack food. Although it      may be popped in a buttered pan or in a microwave, air popped popcorn has      been thought to be the most flavorful and low in fat popcorn. Accordingly,      there have been numerous types of home air poppers to meet this need. When      popping popcorn for commercial situations, however, large containers are      commonly employed, wherein the popcorn may be contained and dispensed by      an attendant. Unfortunately, these types of popping apparatuses require a      vendor to dispense the popcorn and, as a result of the often elevated      popping means are difficult to clean and load. As a result, it would be      highly beneficial and desirous to provide a popcorn popping and dispensing      apparatus, which while being useful for private use, may be highly useful      in a commercial situation wherein an individual may, by inserting money      and activating a solenoid switch, cause a predetermined quantity of      popcorn to be popped and dispensed. Such an apparatus will assure fresh      popcorn to the individual consumer, and will minimize the attendant      requirements. Additionally, it may be easily cleaned to maintain a high      degree of sanitary conditions and prevent non-popping kernels from      remaining in the apparatus and potentially burn. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is directed towards a popcorn popping and dispensing      apparatus adapted to be used in combination with a hot air source. The      apparatus includes primarily a popping chamber having a base, a top, and a      surrounding side wall structure. The base includes mounting means adapted      to facilitate the attachment of the hot air source therethrough. Further      included in the base is an opening which is centrally disposed      therethrough to define an air nozzle. The air nozzle is positioned to      allow passage of forced hot air therethrough from the hot air source into      an interior of the popping chamber. Extending from the top of the popping      chamber is a hollow neck portion. The hollow neck portion has an open      distal end which defines a drop chute where through popping corn kernels      may pass into the interior of the popping chamber for exposure to the      forced hot air and subsequent popping thereof. Further, the popping      chamber includes a surrounding side wall structure. Attached to and      extending angularly downward from an upper portion of the side wall      structure is a discharge chute. The discharge chute is structured and      disposed to allow passage of popped popcorn therethrough and out from an      open end thereof for dispensing to a consumer. Extending angularly upward      from a lower portion of the side wall structure is a cleaning chute. The      cleaning chute which is sealed when the apparatus is in use, is structured      and disposed to facilitate insertion of cleaning instruments, such as a      vacuum tube, therethrough and into said interior of the popping chamber      for cleaning thereof. </PAR><PAR>  It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient and      effective means of popping popcorn utilizing hot air. </PAR><PAR>  Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a popcorn popping      and dispensing means which may be coin operated, thereby eliminating the      requirement for manned dispensing. </PAR><PAR>  Still another object of the present invention is to provide a popcorn      popping and dispensing apparatus which will be easy to clean without      necessitating the disassembling of the entire apparatus. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  For a fuller understanding of the nature of the present invention,      reference should be had to the following detailed description taken in      connection with the accompanying drawings in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a detailed side view of the popcorn popping apparatus within its      housing. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the popcorn popping and dispensing      apparatus. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the popcorn popping and dispensing      apparatus housing. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an overhead view of the popcorn popping and dispensing apparatus      housing. </PAR><PAR>  Like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views of      the drawings. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  As detailed throughout FIGS. 1-4, the present invention is directed towards      a popcorn popping and dispensing apparatus, generally indicated as 10. The      popcorn popping and dispensing apparatus 10 is structured to be easily      used and cleaned, and easily adapted for unmanned, coined operation. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1, the popcorn popping and dispensing apparatus 10      includes primarily a dispensing chamber 20 and an outer housing 60, in the      preferred embodiment. The popping chamber 20, best detailed in FIGS. 1 and      2, includes primarily a top 22, a base 30, and a surrounding side wall      structure 40. The top 22 includes an angled neck portion 24 extending      herefrom which defines a drop chute which as a result of its angle will      not allow popcorn to become jammed therein. Concentrically disposed      through the drop chute 24 is an opening 25 which directs unpopped kernels      passing through the drop chute 24 into an inside 21 of the popping chamber      20. Secured atop the neck portion 24 is a funnel section 26. The funnel      section 26 and the neck portion 24 are separated from one another by a      pivotally mounted cover blade 80, thereby allowing large quantities of      unpopped kernels to be stored and then subsequently dropped into the      funnel section 26 and thereafter released upon pivotal movement of the      cover blade once the kernels have been deposited in the housing, the cover      blade moves into covering relation across the opening of the neck portion      thereby preventing the escape of hot air and popped kernels. </PAR><PAR>  The base 30 includes a centrally disposed opening 34 defining an air      nozzle. The air nozzle 34 is structured and disposed to enable hot air      directed from a hot air source connectable at a flanged collar 32 of the      base 30, to be directed into the interior 21 of the popping chamber 20,      thereby causing kernels therein to pop. </PAR><PAR>  Extending from the surrounding side wall structure 40, and attached at an      upper portion thereof, is a discharge chute 42. The discharge chute 42 is      downwardly angled such that popped popcorn may be easily directed therein      and be dispensed at a distal end 43 of the discharge chute 42. Further      attached to the surrounding side wall structure 40 is a cleaning chute 50.      The cleaning chute 50 is positioned at a lower portion of the surrounding      side wall structure 40 and is angled upwardly. The cleaning chute is      structured and disposed to keep popped popcorn from entering it and to      facilitate the insertion of a cleaning equipment such as a vacuum      therethrough to thoroughly clean the interior 21 of the popping chamber      20. Additionally, the cleaning chute 50 includes a plug 52 positioned so      as to present popcorn which may enter the cleaning chute 50 from escaping      therethrough. </PAR><PAR>  Surrounding the popping chamber 20 and supportably containing it therein is      an exterior housing 60, as best seen in FIG. 3. The exterior housing 60      includes a plurality of openings 62, 64, 66, and 68 structured and      disposed to correspondingly receive the top 22, cleaning chute 50, base      30, and dispensing chute 42 accessibly therethrough. Surrounding the top      22, cleaning chute 50, base 30, and dispensing chute 42 are a plurality of      pressed cork gaskets 63, 65, 67, and 69. These gaskets 63, 65, 67, and 69      are structured and disposed to prevent direct contact between the popping      chamber 20 and the housing 60, thereby preventing excessive heat transfer      to the housing. In order to secure the gasket 63, 65, and 69, in      appropriate positions within the housing 60, the top 22, cleaning chute      50, and dispensing chute 42 include protruding rims 23, 51, and 44 to      maintain the gaskets 62, 65, and 69 properly and securely positioned.      Further included within the housing 60 is an insulative material 90. The      insulative material 90, which may be cork or wood chips, is disposed about      the popping chamber 20 so as to isolate the popping chamber 20 from heat      loss and increase the efficiency of the popping therein, and also function      to further maintain the popping chamber 20 securely positioned within the      housing 60. </PAR><PAR>  Positioned atop the housing 60, as best seen in FIGS. 3 and 4, is a      vibrating motor 70. The vibrating motor 70 is structured so as to cause      the housing 60 and the popping chamber 20 to vibrate, thereby making      popped popcorn contained in the interior of the popping chamber to be      directed into the dispensing chute 42 for dispensing to a consumer.      Further included atop the housing 60 is a solenoid switch 74. The solenoid      switch 74 which may be coin activated is connected to a distal end 82 of      the cover blade 80. The cover blade 80 which normally includes a proximate      end 84 in covering relation over the opening 25 in the top 22, is      pivotally mounted on a mounting joint 86. When activated, the solenoid 74      causes the distal end 82 of the cover blade 80 to be pulled towards it and      pivot about the mounting joint 86, thereby uncovering the opening 25 and      causing a predetermined quantity of unpopped kernels to pass through the      opening 25 and into the interior 21 of the popping chamber 20. In order to      return the cover blade 80 into its normal covering relation over the      opening 25, a spring 88 is disposed to pull back the cover blade when the      solenoid switch 74 is disengaged. Accordingly, predetermined servings of      popcorn may be easily dispensed into the popping chamber 20 for fresh      popping and dispensing to a consumer on request. </PAR><PAR>  Now that the invention has been described, </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
