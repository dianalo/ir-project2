The 144-page book, produced by the Greater Boston Convention andVisitors Bureau, gives the wrong location for many downtownlandmarks.   Even the Prudential Center, where the book is sold for $2 fromthe tourism bureau's office, is identified on the guide's map asbeing several blocks from its actual location.   ``Unfortunately, errors like this happen,'' said Robert Cumings,president of the bureau, which receives $1 million of its $3 millionbudget from the state.   The bureau was formed to promote tourism, but visitors using the1988-89 Official Guidebook to get around Boston's Back Bay will findnearly every major landmark incorrectly located.   For example, the map places the Ritz-Carlton hotel three blocksfrom its actual location at Newbury and Arlington Streets. Touristsare told that The Four Seasons Hotel, on Boylston Street across fromthe Public Garden, is on Newbury Street.   Cumings, whose salary has risen 72 percent to $105,000 over thepast three years, told The Boston Sunday Globe that the errors havebeen corrected, although the book was still on sale last week.</TEXT><NOTE>Eds: Following item for release at 6 p.m. EST.</NOTE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parents who want their kids to grow up to bepresident should move to Virginia and give birth to a blue-eyed babyin October, according to an article published Monday.   ``Call him James. That's what six presidents' parents did,''advises the January issue of Parents magazine. ``And there's no needfor a middle name _ almost half (of all presidents) didn't haveone.''   What if James is a Jane? ``Don't despair! Last year the number ofwomen in elected office in the United States exceeded 18,000.''   The article said that while Albert Einstein and Isaac Newtonshowed early genius in their areas of expertise, few presidents were``superkids.''   More than half of all presidents had blue eyes, none was an onlychild and Virginia was the most popular birthplace.   But do you really want your child to have such a high-pressurejob?   ``When 5-year-old FDR visited the White House in 1887, PresidentGrover Cleveland patted him on the head and said, `My little man, Iam making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never bepresident of the United States,''' the article said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance for 6 p.m. EST.</NOTE><DATELINE>CHUNKY, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mississippi's frosty weather is warming thehearts of Dancer and Prancer, and they're playing reindeer games.   ``They are having a ball in this cold weather,'' Shirley May saidof two female reindeer on her family's Christmas tree farm in thegreen, rural Mississippi countryside. ``They are running out thereand having a great time, and I'm sitting here with a coat on.''   Shirley and her husband, Raburn, brought the two reindeer fromWhite Mountain, Alaska, to Mississippi in July. Actually, a trio ofreindeer were flown in, but the third died of what May called``shipping fever.''   The reindeer were brought in to add a holiday touch to May's LazyAcres Christmas Tree Farm. Families can peek at the grayish-brownanimals not seen much in these parts _ other than on Christmas Eve.   The Mays still plan to add a third reindeer _ possibly a buck _early in 1989. They hope to one day own a herd the size of Santa's.   In the meantime, they're making sure Dancer and Prancer are tunedup for Christmas Eve. ``They will be well rested for Santa,'' Maysaid.</TEXT><DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After 40 years, the thrill of the mysteryChristmas coconut is gone for Ed Clinch, but he's still a good sportabout it.   Every year since 1948, a decorated coconut has been delivered toClinch as a practical joke from an unknown prankster. The gag iswearing thin now for the 73-year-old victim, even though he stillgood-naturedly accepts the gift.   It started in 1948, with a bunch of buddies, Clinch recalled.   ``I came back from the war telling a lot of stories about thePhilippines and coconuts. I think one of my pals got an idea fromthat,'' he said.   ``The first year, I took it to a party and we were throwing itaround and singing, `I Ain't Got Nobody.'''   The coconut's delivery soon became an annual event. Coconuts havebeen delivered to Clinch via ambulance, police canine corps, pastPeoria mayors, an FBI agent and even by the Bradley Universitybasketball team.   Clinch said he has blackmailed his buddies, got mad at them andtried every means of persuasion possible to uncover the joker.   ``One time, every one of my friends admitted to it. What was Igoing to do?'' he said.   The 1988 coconut was delivered by a local radio station discjockey.   ``It's a never-ending story. I don't know what to say exceptMerry Christmas and Happy Coconut.''</TEXT></DOC>
