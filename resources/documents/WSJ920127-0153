Sadto say, he's paying a price for it.   For the past three days newspapers and television havebeen full of stories about an allegation of maritalinfidelity: Specifically, Gennifer Flowers of Little Rock hastold the Star -- a sleazy supermarket tabloid -- that she hada 12-year affair with the Arkansas governor, something hedenies.</LP><TEXT>   This story, from a dubious source who was paid money by athoroughly disreputable paper, has dominated the Clintoncampaign. The other day, the Democratic front-runner spentfour hours here huddled in private strategy sessions over howto handle this latest blast. Then last night he and his wife,Hillary, made a dramatic appearance on CBS's top-rated &quot;60Minutes&quot; TV program in front of a huge post-Super Bowlaudience.   In the process, this shabby accusation has distorted andcontaminated not only the political system but the judgmentof some in the news media. Personal and political moralityhave been confused, as has the critical distinction betweenreputable and disreputable sources.   Let's certify this up front: Bill Clinton has hadextramarital affairs. Any reporter who has done any researchknows it, and the average voter doesn't have to be a rocketscientist to figure it out. Even before his &quot;60 Minutes&quot;appearance, Gov. Clinton's response, when asked aboutinfidelity, was that he and his wife have had their share ofproblems, but that they now are fully committed to eachother.   That should have been sufficient, since no one could doubthe was acknowledging previous indiscretions. There are atleast four conditions that would make more informationpertinent about a would-be president:   One, if the candidate lies.   Two, if it's a contemporaneous situation. Gary Hart gotwhat he deserved: Under today's rules, anyone carrying on anaffair during a campaign lacks the judgment and discipline tobe president.   Three, if any extramarital sexual relationships directlyaffect a politician's public life or governing decisions.   And four, if there's blatant hypocrisy involved. Anycandidate who's running on a platform of restoring moralityin America had better be pretty pure -- just as there's agreater burden on defense hawks to explain a lack of militaryservice, or pro-busing liberals to explain sending their kidsto private schools.   If any of these conditions apply to Bill Clinton, heshouldn't be in the race. But from what we know so far, noneof them do.   Yeah, some feminists say, but it tells a lot about apolitician's attitude toward women. A much better guide ishow he governs on issues that are important to women, andwhat kind of appointments he has made. Betsey Wright orGloria Cabeboth of whom served both as chiefs of staff andcampaign chiefs to Mr. Clinton -- or Carol Rosco, his topgubernatorial aide today, would be better sources for thisquestion than Gennifer Flowers. Otherwise, we confusepersonal character and political character.   Even if one wants to apply more rigid criteria to thislatest allegation, it remains a travesty. A year ago, thesame Ms. Flowers who is making these charges had her attorneythreaten a Little Rock radio station with a lawsuit becauseone of its disc jockeys &quot;wrongfully and untruthfully&quot; allegedthat she had had an affair with Bill Clinton.   What transpired since then? The Star offered her moneywith estimates ranging from $50,000 to $200,000. (A lawyersaying he represented Ms. Flowers told the NBC TV networkthat his client might be willing to talk for $100,000.)   The Star believes in checkbook journalism if the story issaucy and salacious; it's indifferent to truth and accuracy.Yet this paper set the agenda for the Clinton story.Thursday, for instance, ABC's &quot;Nightline&quot; devoted an entireedition to the charges of infidelity against Gov. Clinton.   Usually, &quot;Nightline&quot; is the crown jewel of the televisionnetworks' public affairs programs, and anchorman Ted Koppelis one of the great journalists of our age. But theunderlying premise of this influential program was that theClinton allegation was a serious charge from a serioussource. Efforts by two of the guests, one a Clintonconsultant and the other an author of a book on mediaoverkill on scandals, were overwhelmed by the seriousnesswith which the topic was treated.   At one point, Mr. Koppel declared that Mr. Clinton &quot;hasgiven waffling answers&quot; about marital infidelity. What's hesupposed to do -- provide names, dates and techniques? Onanother occasion, Mr. Koppel asked whether, if President Bushheld a news conference to denounce Ted Koppel a pedophile anddrug dealer, news organizations should carry the story. Ofcourse they should. But does a journalistically despicable,sensationalism-seeking tabloid deserve the same credibilityand respect as a source as does the president of the UnitedStates?   There are lots of real questions about Mr. Clinton as apotential president. He sometimes seems to have more plansand programs than vision. And as Joe Klein wrote in anexcellent piece in New York magazine, there's a question ofwhat's at the core of this very smart and ambitious man.There may even be other types of personal incidents in hispast that are worthy of closer scrutiny.   But if Bill Clinton is driven out of this race by asordid, sleazy story about an alleged sexual affair, it willhurt American politics and presidential elections for yearsto come.   ---   Mr. Hunt is chief of the Journal's Washington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
