Monday announced the immediate availability of Microsoft Wordversion 5.5 for DOS systems.andM;The new version features a visual user interface that provides easier accessto all features and greater interface consistency and compatibility withother members of the Microsoft Word family.andM;&quot;The number one request from our users was to make Word for DOS even easierto use,&quot; said Jeff Raikes, vice president for office systems at Microsoft.andO;&quot;We responded by dramatically improving the user interface, making Word mucheasier to use and providing better access to its leading feature set.andP;  Weremain committed to our character-based product, which is a worldwidebest-seller, and plan to continue to provide improvements beyond version5.5.&quot;andM;The visual interface design of Microsoft Word version 5.5 is based on recentresearch which found that visual interfaces are easy to learn and use,provide better access to features, and give users expanded flexibility andpower.andP;  Microsoft has taken many of the interface innovations from itsgraphical word processing products (Word for Windows, Word for OS/2, and Wordfor Apple Macintosh systems) and is making them available in thecharacter-based DOS environment.andP;  For example, features such as pull-downmenus, dialog boxes and other visual aids used for formatting all look andwork similar to each other.andM;NEW VISUAL AND INTUITIVE INTERFACE The new interface implements on thecharacter-based DOS platform many of the benefits of the graphical interfacesfound on the Microsoft Windows, OS/2, and Macintosh environments:andM;-- Commands are now presented visually with intuitive pull-down menus and popup dialog boxes.andP;  These menus can be accessed using the mouse or thekeyboard.andP;  Many powerful features which previously were accessed solely fromthe keyboard are now easily accessible from the menus -- including glossariesand macros.andM;-- Many common formatting commands are now presented visually at the top ofthe screen through a ribbon and a ruler.andP;  The ribbon is one of the conceptsMicrosoft pioneered in its graphical word processing products, and for thefirst time is available in a character-based DOS word processor.andP;  Thesevisual tools allow the user to apply common formatting preferences such asbold, italic, and underline, and to indent margins and set tabs by a click ofthe mouse or with one keystroke.andP;  The formatting result is seen immediatelyon the screen.andM;-- Styles, a feature also pioneered by Microsoft, allows users toautomatically apply the same formatting throughout different paragraphs anddocuments.andP;  Styles are also available from the ribbon, making them mucheasier to access and use.andM;-- Microsoft Word version 5.5 is the first full-featured word processor toimplement a full windowing interface in a character-based environment.andO;Microsoft Word version 5.5 makes it extremely easy to work with several opendocuments simultaneously, including having overlapping or tiled windows.andO;Each window can be easily sized and moved using the mouse or keyboard.andO;Microsoft Word version 5.5's expanded and enhanced Help system and stylesheets can also be in separate windows, making them easily accessible whilestill viewing the primary document.andM;The resemblance of Microsoft Word version 5.5 to other products in the Wordfamily will benefit businesses that use multiple personal computer hardwareplatforms or operating systems; the common interface will reduce overalltraining and support costs.andP;  The Word family offers a convenient way totransfer files across platforms.andP;  Using the Word RTF (rich text format) fileformat, Microsoft Word version 5.5 can share files with Word for Windows,Word for OS/2 and Word for Macintosh.andM;EASY TRANSITION FOR EXISTING USERS For existing users, Microsoft Word version5.5 comes with tools and options designed to ease the transition to version5.5.andP;  A special command on the Help menu (Word version 5.0 to version 5.5)shows keystroke and terminology changes.andM;All the familiar Word commands are available, although some have taken onmore intuitive names (the Transfer Load command has been renamed &quot;File Open,&quot;for example).andP;  All files, glossaries, styles and dictionaries that werecreated in version 5.0 can be used in version 5.5 without modification.andP;  Autility is provided to help with the conversion of macros created withMicrosoft Word version 5.0 so they can be used with Microsoft Word version5.5.andP;  Additionally, users have the option of choosing either Microsoft Wordversion 5.0 or 5.5 function keys.andM;PRODUCT SUPPORT Product support is available by calling 206/462-WORD from 5a.m.andP;  to 7 p.m.andP;  Pacific Standard Time, Monday through Friday.andP;  Additionally,an automated &quot;after hours&quot; product support system, containing 358 of the mostcommonly asked questions by Word users, has been implemented to supportMicrosoft Word version 5.5.andP;
