As stock prices have dropped over the past few weeks, companies that had planned to issue common stock have been rethinking the notion. Yesterday two issuers -- CT Financial Inc., a thrift unit of Montreal-based Imasco Ltd., and Topps Co. -- announced they were postponing stock issues. More quietly, other prospective issuers are following suit, brokers said.    One, at least temporary, casualty is the expected initial public offering of Los Angeles-based MTM Entertainment Inc., which in more propitious circumstances might have been aimed for next week.    &quot;We're waiting for some semblance of stability out there,&quot; said John E. Carney Jr., syndicate manager at lead manager Lazard Freres andamp; Co.    The expected range of prices for the four million share offering is $25 to $28 a share, and Mr. Carney said the firm isn't even thinking yet about whether to adjust that.    &quot;There's no point now in putting out any price talk,&quot; he said. &quot;Almost any new issue is a dirty word now.&quot;    Topps, the New York-based maker of baseball cards and chewing gum, had planned to sell 2.5 million shares. When the company filed the offering, its stock was trading at about $20 a share. The stock, which closed Tuesday at $17.50 a share, rose sharply yesterday and closed at $19.375 in national over-the-counter trading.    Topps' chairman and chief executive officer, Arthur T. Shorin, said neither he nor other selling stockholders &quot;has any interest in selling shares at the current price, given the strong outlook we see for the business.&quot;    Topps, which was taken private in a leveraged buyout in 1984, went public again earlier this year at $13 a share.    Many offerings that have made it to market during the last couple of weeks have been scaled down in price. A Communications Transmission Inc. offering Thursday, expected at $13 a share to $16 a share, was priced at $12, and a Stage II Apparel Corp. offering the same day, expected at $10 to $12, came to market at $8.    Communications Transmission, based in Austin, Texas, provides transmission capacity to competitors of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Stage II Apparel is based in New York.    One underwriter said that on an offering he is planning to file today, he would be biting the bullet on price. Demand for the offering had been strong, he said, and &quot;we've been pushing the price up.&quot; However, in the wake of yesterday's market dive, &quot;we're recommending to the company to pull the price down a point,&quot; dropping the expected price range $1 a share.    In a rocky market, he said, there is no point pushing for the last penny.    One company that did come to market this week did so because the offering fit in with its long-term plans. B.F. Goodrich Co., which issued 1.8 million shares at $55 a share on Monday, used the proceeds mainly to reduce debt.    In a statement, the Akron, Ohio-based tire maker conceded its stock price has been higher -- it reached $65 earlier this year -- but said it was satisfied with the price of $55. Goodrich closed at $53.875, down 87.5 cents, in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.    The falling market hasn't hurt every issuer equally, and a few companies have seen offerings flourish through the worst of the market's decline.    M.A. Hanna Co., which came to market Tuesday with a $58 million offering, was able to increase the size of the issue about $7.5 million. The stock of the Cleveland-based iron ore producer, offered at $27.25 a share, closed yesterday at $27.125 on the Big Board.    From an issuer's perspective, said John F. Perkowski, head of investment banking at PaineWebber Inc., lead manager of the M.A. Hanna issue, it may make sense to come to market even in a falling market.    If a company is expanding, Mr. Perkowski said, &quot;our advice is to go ahead.&quot; After all, he said, while an issuer's price may be lower than it was two months ago, &quot;it's still higher than it was a year ago.&quot;    At least one issuer is going ahead. Because British Petroleum's #7.5 billion ($12.35 billion) offering, coordinated out of London, is being sold world-wide, its schedule is pretty well set in stone.    U.S. underwriters, led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., commit to the stock this week but won't know their allotments -- or the share price -- until the end of the month, when they will be able to sell it. </TEXT></DOC>
