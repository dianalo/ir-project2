(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Walt Disney Co. has adopted a ``poisonpill'' anti-takeover defense but says it does not know of anyprospective bids for the company.   The plan adopted by Disney's board of directors and announcedWednesday would entitle present stockholders to buy new stock athalf price in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. Such plansdilute the holdings of a potential buyer, making a buyout withoutmanagement consent prohibitively expensive.   The plan is similar to those adopted at many Americancorporations in recent years, and has been under consideration atDisney for several months, said spokesman Tom Deegan.   ``It was not as a result of anything that has happened in thelast several weeks,'' Deegan said. He was referring to the three-waybuyout battle among Paramount Communications, Time Inc. and WarnerCommunications Inc., and to a trend toward consolidation of mediagiants.   ``While we are not aware of any effort to acquire control of thecompany, the stockholder rights plan represents a sound andreasonable means of safeguarding the interests of allstockholders,'' Disney said in a news release.</TEXT></DOC>
