Two blocks from the church, where thousands of women had plannedto assemble, white extremists went ahead with twogovernment-approved rallies. Fights broke out between the khaki-cladneo-Nazis and black onlookers. Police made several arrests andchased blacks away with batons.   Downtown Pretoria resembled a militarized zone, with majorstreets closed to civilian traffic throughout normally busy morningshopping hours. Hundreds of policemen and scores of riot-controlvehicles were deployed to prevent the women's march and monitor theright-wing rallies.   The white extremists sought and received permission todemonstrate, but the women's planned march to governmentheadquarters was banned because organizers refused to seek a permit.   Authorities also said they feared simultaneous protests by suchdiverse factions might spark violence.   Zeni Tshongweni, a spokeswoman for organizers of the women'smarch, said many would-be marchers were arrested when they tried toassemble near the Union Buildings, their intended destination. Otheractivists said several people, including children and elderly women,were injured when police used clubs and dogs to disperse the crowd.   Police said 154 people were arrested, all released after beingtold to appear in court Monday. Police headquarters said most of thearrests came when officers were pelted with stones and bottles whileconfronting scores of blacks, including well-known activist WinnieMandela, at a trade union office after the march was canceled.   Police said three people were injured, but gave no details.   Mrs. Mandela, wife of imprisoned African National Congress leaderNelson Mandela, and other blacks aboard two buses later were chasedby a convoy of police vehicles and ordered to leave Pretoria.   ``We came here peacefully but they are seeking violence,'' Mrs.Mandela said.   Some of the biggest marches in South Africa's history have takenplace in the past two weeks, after new President F.W. de Klerk saidhis government would allow peaceful protests. Authorities announcedFriday that leaders of such marches must obtain advance approval.   An authorized anti-apartheid march was held Saturday in Boksburg,near Johannesburg. An estimated 2,500 mixed-race residents paradedpeacefully from their segregated neighborhood to the downtown areato protest the right-wing-controlled city council's reimposition ofstrict segregation ordinances.   In Pretoria, anti-apartheid lawyer Ismail Ayob was at St. Alban'sAnglican Cathedral when it became apparent the women would be unableto assemble there.   ``It's been a great success for the government,'' he said.``Roadblocks as far back as Soweto (a black township an hour's driveaway), barbed wire, security vehicles. The government has made itspoint.''   A notice tacked to a church door said the government had obtaineda court order banning a pre-march service and the march itself. Twotrucks mounted with tear gas cannons were parked beside the church.   ``It is the same as any other country in the world. People can'tbreak the law,'' said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, standingwith riot police outside St. Alban's.   Police briefly detained Richard Sergay, correspondent for ABCNews, and several other journalists.   March organizers said police blocked most traffic from blacktownships around Pretoria. Roadblocks were set up at entrances intothe city, with officers searching many vehicles and turning backsome.   At Church Square, the heart of the capital, about 500 whiteextremists sang Afrikaans hymns and listened to Bible readings ashundreds of blacks watched from the plaza's perimeter.   Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner ResistanceMovement, assailed de Klerk's proposals to give the black majority ashare of political power. If the government capitulates, he said,his group would use force to regain white dominance.   One neo-Nazi banner said, ``Apartheid: Solution for AIDS.''Another demanded the hanging of Nelson Mandela and freedom forBarend Strydom, a white ex-policeman sentenced to death for killingseven blacks in a shooting spree in Pretoria last year.   About 40 blacks trying to cross the square were accosted bymembers of the resistance movement, who wear kahki uniforms withswastika-like symbols.   Officers ran through the square, arresting blacks and orderingpeople out of the area. At least one white extremist also wasarrested.   Police then allowed a second rally by right-wingers who splitfrom the Afrikaner Resistance Movement earlier this year.   The right-wing rallies were convened in response to a protest inthe square last week by blacks condemning police brutality. Someblacks had climbed atop a statue of Paul Kruger, a folk hero of theDutch-descended Afrikaners who now control the government.</TEXT></DOC>
