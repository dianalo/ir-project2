But he said Western countries are ready to help Poland and if the measures are put into effect, beneficial effects would be discernible in a year. He said the government would try to soften the pain of the program by introducing such measures as unemployment benefits.    Previously exercised remedies such as price controls, ration coupons and centralized distribution would only worsen the problems and delay the cure, Mr. Balcerowicz said.    After Mr. Balcerowicz's announcement, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa warned advisers that his movement -- and he personally -- could be blamed by angry Poles for the worsening situation.    JAPANESE ACQUISITION    Yokohama Rubber Co., Japan's second largest automobile-tire maker, said it bought U.S. tire maker Mohawk Rubber Co. for $150 million. A Yokohama Rubber spokesman said the Japanese company wanted to set up a production point in the U.S. &quot;All the {Japanese} auto makers are investing abroad,&quot; he said. &quot;It's absolutely necessary to have a production base.&quot; The Tokyo-based company, whose sales increased 9.7% to 327.4 billion yen ($2.30 billion) last year, currently exports automobile tires to the U.S.    AUSTRALIAN MINING BAN    The Australian government banned mining in most of the Kakadu wilderness park, where the film &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; was shot. The move delighted environmentalists but angered mining companies, particularly Broken Hill Proprietary, or BHP, which has spent $9.2 million in exploration in the park. BHP, Australia's largest company, heads a consortium that had been planning to exploit the park's mineral deposits. BHP executive Dick Carter said the company was &quot;astounded&quot; by the ban.    IRANIAN NEGOTIATIONS    Iran is said to be negotiating with French and Japanese companies to raise more than $1 billion now in return for oil shipments to continue over a period of time. Iran needs the foreign exchange to pay for raw materials, food imports and the reconstruction of its industry after its war with Iraq, according to Persian Gulf bankers. The pre-financed oil deals are one of the few ways in which Iran can borrow on international markets without sparking a domestic debate on borrowing from the West, the bankers add.    BRAZILIAN EMERGENCY    Brazil announced emergency price controls in the wake of sharp price increases that President Jose Sarney blamed on &quot;dishonest and ambitious speculators.&quot; Top ministers and businessmen signed an agreement to limit price increases for public utilities and 135 products, ranging from coffee to cars. The agreement restricts price hikes to once a month and to a maximum of 90% of the previous month's inflation. Last year, Brazil's inflation reached 1,200%; in this September alone, it reached 36%. In a related action, Brazilian monetary authorities took steps expected to damp speculation in gold and the related free market for dollars. Investments in gold and dollars have risen sharply since mid-September because of market players' growing fears that the new cruzado is losing its value.    THE 'SPYCATCHER' CASE    The European Commission of Human Rights agreed to investigate a complaint against the British government by three national newspapers banned from printing extracts of &quot;Spycatcher.&quot;    The three papers -- the Guardian, the Observer and the Times -- took their case to the commission after the House of Lords, England's highest legal authority, banned them in July 1987 from publishing extracts of the book by former British security-services officer Peter Wright.    The government argued that the book was a threat to national security, a claim rebutted by the press on the ground it was already available in the U.S. The EC agreed to consider an appeal by the newspapers that the government ban, overturned in June 1988, constituted a breach of human rights.    The decision is the first step in a long battle that could eventually be taken to the European Court of Human Rights.    POSTSCRIPTS . . .    An official Chinese newspaper said that several thousand first-year students from six Chinese provincial universities will be sent to military camps to correct their ideological outlook. The military training &quot;would be aimed at the bad influences on schools of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion,&quot; the paper said . . . Sony Corp. has donated $3 million to the University of Illinois to endow a research and teaching position in electrical and computer engineering. </TEXT></DOC>
