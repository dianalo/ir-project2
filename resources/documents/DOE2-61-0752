Metallographic analysis reveals a high susceptibility to creepcavitation at grain boundaries perpendicular to the applied stress. Thestrong dependence of the rupture time on grain aspect ratio and stressdirection is interpreted in terms of a model in which it is assumed thatthe extent of creep constraint on damage formation governs the fracturebehaviour. It is concluded that for realizing the full potential of dispersionstrengthening, fine grain regions must be eliminated.</TEXT></DOC>
