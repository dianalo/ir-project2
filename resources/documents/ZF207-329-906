 The typical reasons for resisting CAD are that it istoo complicated, too expensive, or too difficult to learn.andP;  Potential userslament that they don't have the time to learn a CAD package, that they won'tuse it enough to justify the investment in training, or that their work isinsufficiently complex to merit it.andM;With the advent of the packages considered here, these excuses no longerapply.andP;  Low-end CAD packages for the Mac justify themselves for relativelydemanding applications as well as easy, &quot;casual&quot; use.andM;CAD is not a new tool -- it has been around for more than 20 years.andP;  As such,it is a mature and proven technology.andP;  What is news, however, is the changingnature of the CAD user.andP;  The Macintosh brings the power of CAD to thefingertips of mere mortals, even mortals pressed for time.andP;  It also makes CADaccessible and affordable.andP;  It considerably broadens not only the user basebut also the range of applications and market conduits for CAD products.andM;Starting at $100, these Macintosh CAD products are within the reach ofeveryone.andP;  You don't need to be a millionaire to afford them.andP;  You don't needto be a rocket scientist to understand them.andP;  You don't need to spend a largepercentage of your lifespan acquiring the operational skills to master them.andO;And they are available at local software stores.andP;  This is also news, as CADpackages have previously been available only through specialized CADresellers.andM;From the 40 CAD offerings now available for the Macintosh (see &quot;What YouDon't Get&quot; sidebar), we review three packages that are readily availablethrough mass-distribution channels.andP;  The three products are Claris CAD ($799)from Claris (Mountain View, California); DREAMS ($500) from Innovative DataDesign (Concord, California); and Generic CADD Level 1 ($99.95 for version1.0, $149.95 for version 1.1) from Generic Software (Bothell, Washington).andO;Our criteria for deciding which products to review were that they had to beandM;* Stocked by established networks of major software resellers.andM;* Low in price (as CAD software goes).andM;* Shrink-wrap released and available.andM;* Likely to attract a wide range of purchasers.andM;Many Macintosh CAD products meet most of these criteria, but only Claris CAD,DREAMS, and Generic CADD meet them all.andP;  Each of the companies that developedthese packages has proclaimed a strategy of bringing CAD to amassmarket--they have committed the promotional budgets, marketing resources,and technical support to make it happen.andP;  Furthermore, they have a good graspof CAD's new role as an adjunct to other engineering tasks.andM;This understanding contrasts with the view of their smaller competitors, whotend to regard CAD as the all-encompassing need of their customer base.andM;When you open a low-end CAD package, you should expect reliable,well-designed, and easily understood software; well-prepared, well-writtendocumentation; tutorials; help facilities; and perhaps a videotape.andP;  You alsoneed some things you won't find in the box: upgrade programs, usernewsletters, and a multiphone help line (as opposed to a single support line,which is often busy).andP;  The three applications examined here meet theseexpectations.andM;Test NotesandM;During our evaluations, we learned that Generic Software was working on arevision (1.1) that provides additional capabilities.andP;  We examined a betacopy of this version.andP;  It was developed enough at press time to be includedin both our Summary of CAD Features chart and in our performance timings, butbecause the package was in beta form, we stopped there.andM;As this issue went to press, VersaCAD introduced a reduced-cost,mass-distribution version of its popular high-end CAD product.andP;  At $995,VersaCAD Drafter 2.0 sells for half the price of VersaCAD/Macintosh Edition2.0($1,995).andP;  For purposes of comparison, we included VersaCAD Drafter in ourfeatures chart.andP;  We will give it a full review in an upcoming issue.andM;We included an earlier CAD product, MacDraft, from Innovative Data Design(IDD), in our features chart, although we did not test it.andP;  MacDraftwarranted inclusion because more than 65,000 copies of it are in use, it isstill being sold in quantity, and the differences between this package andDREAMS are significant.andM;Likewise, we included Claris' MacDraw II in the features chart primarilybecause of its popularity (it is among the top-ten best-selling Mac products)and to underscore the extensive differences between MacDraw II and ClarisCAD.andM;Purpose of Our TestsandM;Although the low-end products we tested don't do everything theirmore-expensive cousins do, they are real, accessible CAD products.andP;  We wantedto answer the following questions about each of these products:andM;* How accessible is it?andM;* How easy to learn and use?andM;* How fast?andM;* How reliable?andM;* How comprehensive?andM;* How powerful?andM;*How good is the documentation?andM;In short, MacUser Labs aspired to explore the viability of this new class ofCAD products.andP;  The Labs has traditionally tested peripheral and add-onhardware products, with their easily defined, easily measured performanceparameters.andP;  For CAD software, however, developing meaningful tests is not sosimple.andM;The Labs approached testing from different directions simultaneously.andP;  Weexamined learning curves, ease of use, and performance characteristics foreach package.andP;  Our goal was to provide accurate software-performancecomparisons as well as opinions on experiences with the products from a rangeof users.andM;To find out how easily beginners could learn and use the applications, weengaged 11 college students at California State University, Northridge(CSUN), to test the products.andP;  The students could provide us, we reasoned,with a viewpoint akin to that of potential CAD purchasers because they wereable to devote only part-time study to the packages and had varying degreesof exposure to and experience with CAD.andM;During a three-week period, the students had to learn the three CAD productsand produce three drawings per product: an organization chart, a dimensionedmechanical part drawing, and a floor plan of a small house.andP;  They got oneweek with each product.andP;  At the end of each week, the students were requiredto deliver the drawings and complete a detailed questionnaire beforeproceeding to the next product.andP;  We also asked them to judge the quality ofeach package.andM;To compare the students' observations, measurements, and conclusions withthose of someone with more design experience, we engaged a professionaldesigner to perform exactly the same exercises in the same time period.andM;The results from these tests are highly consistent.andP;  The testers were ingeneral agreement about the three CAD products.andP;  Our in-house performancebenchmarks were timed in the MacUser Labs by professional testers undertightly controlled conditions.andP;  The three software manufacturers were askedto participate in an advisory capacity and provided input on the Labs' TestScript.andP;  Each of the companies commented on how the tests could be mosteffectively conducted with its product.andM;For more than 20 years, how to test CAD software has been subject to debate.andO;Although many have tried to test CAD performance, no perfect way has beenfound.andP;  We wanted to measure performance as fairly as possible.andP;  To that end,MacUser Labs' staff created an identical drawing file on each of theproducts, cosisting of 100 groups of graphic elements arranged in a 10 x 10array.andP;  This approach gave us functionally identical data to use with eachproduct, although the three files were different sizes.andM;Tests were subsequently performed, product by product, using the sameMacintosh configurations.andM;We timed each program as it performed common CAD operations: redrawing,dragging/moving, zooming in and out, rotating, and ungrouping.andP;  Thesefrequently used CAD operations were selected because they are the operationsthat usually keep users waiting.andP;  We eschewed the classic benchmarkingapproach (recording the time it takes advanced users to create a certaindrawing on competing applications) because it depends largely on theoperator's skill rather than on the application's speed and performance.andM;The Lab's timing tests show a direct relationship between product cost andperformance.andP;  The most expensive CAD product we tested (Claris CAD) wasgenerally the fastest.andM;A Quick HistoryandM;In the late '60s, if your engineering department had a few million dollarsfor hardware, a few million more to develop software, and a dungeon full ofassembly-language programmers, you might have been able to generate simple2-D drawings with a mainframe computer.andP;  Such was the case at major aerospacecompanies such as Lockheed and at automotive giants such as GM.andM;That original technology has since evolved and has now migrated toMacintoshes.andP;  Today's Mac CAD products are more comprehensive and polishedthan their mainframe ancestors ever were.andP;  Today's mainframe CAD facilitiesalso evolved from the same roots, buty they are currently faster, morecapable, and more sophisticated than they were in the late '60s.andP;  They retainone link with the past, however: they're very hard to learn.andM;The few original CAD users were full-time operators.andP;  Their employers couldafford to buy only one or two CAD consoles, so the user ranks remained thin.andO;Users took months to learn CAD and then spent the balance of thier woefullives in the glow of bulky, colossally expensive display consoles.andM;The per-hour cost of CAD at that time was so huge that only the mostimportant, complex tasks were performed with computers.andP;  Overhead was highand salaries were low, so the cost of training was minute compared with thecost of implementing an entire CAD system.andP;  Hence, no one paid much attentionto training.andM;The entire CAD industry evolved with this mentality.andP;  Everyone assumed thatCAD had to be difficult, had to be a trial to learn, because -- well, that'sthe way the world worked.andP;  To get people to use their products, CAD vendorshired teachers and organized schools.andP;  But a pattern was established, andunfortunately that pattern still reigns at the high end of today's CADmarket, where training support is still badly needed.andM;Over the past 20 years, CAD hardware has become dramatically more affordable.andO;The cost per &quot;CAD seat&quot; (an industry term for what a single operatorrequires) tumbled, first down to the hundreds of thousands of dollars, thento tens of thousands, and finally -- with the advent of personal computers --to only a few thousand dollars.andM;Training costs began to rise as software remained complex, and meanwhile thecosts for engineering labor headed through the roof.andM;By about three years ago, the situation had reversed from what it was 20years ago: it became more expensive to learn CAD than to buy it.andP;  Time may berelative, but it is also money.andP;  That's why CAD on the Macintosh has grown soquickly.andM;Claris CAD, DREAMS, and Generic CADD Level 1 differ from each other like aMac Plus differs from an SE, or an SE differs from a II or IIx.andP;  Like theMacs, these CAD products share a common purpose while contrasting infeatures, performance, and price.andP;  Which Mac is the best?andP;  That depends onyour budget and your needs.andP;  Which CAD product is the best?andP;  The anser is thesame.andM;Generic CADD Level 1andM;Generic Software, developer of Generic CADD Level 1, began in the MS-DOSarena in 1985.andP;  With more than 100,000 copies shipped, Generic's DOS CADproduct is second only to AutoCAD in number of users.andP;  The company's approachin the DOS world is to provide a very-low-cost kernel product and thensurround it with add-on options to increase functionality.andM;Generic entered the Mac market in mid-1988, announcing two products: CADDLevel 1 and CADD Level 2.Level 1 was delivered before the end of the year,but, as of press time for this issue, Level 2 had not yet shipped.andM;Generic also provides optional symbol libraries.andP;  In the 26 types of symbollibraries listed in the company's catalog, 11 were available at press time.andO;The libraries include symbols for architects, landscapers, electronicdesigners, and mechanical designers.andP;  There's even a set meant forprogrammers who want to draw flowcharts.andM;At $99.95 (or $149.95 for Version 1.1), Generic CADD Level 1 is extremelyaffordable.andP;  The product falls short of its upscale rivals in our featurescomparison, but it is a capable package for the money.andP;  Its database usesprecise floating-point numbers (to 16 decimal places).andP;  You can save drawingsin either single or double precision.andP;  Some people insist that seriousdrafting requires floating-point accuracy.andP;  That degree of precision might beuseful in cases of extreme range (such as accurately locating a single riveton an entire airplane), but such cases are not common.andP;  The drawback ofdouble-precision floating-point calculations is that they usually take moretime than less-precise ones.andP;  This speed reduction is reflected in Generic'sperformance in the timing tests.andP;  In six of the eight tests on an SE, GenericCADD was slower than the other two products (which don't use floating-pointmath in their calculations).andM;Generic CADD ships in a compact package consisting of two disks.andP;  Thedocumentation is well written and generously illustrated, and it contains atutorial that quickly gets you into the swing of things.andM;One of Generic CADD's big advantages is that it is very easy to learn.andP;  Ourstudent testers averaged 2.4 hours of learning time before they were ready tostart drafting the required drawings.andP;  The professional tester took 2 hoursto get to the same point.andM;Although all the testers were able to execute the three drawings with GenericCADD, they reported that the program's sparse facilities made the draftingdifficult.andP;  Workarounds were found for unsupported tasks such as dashedcircles (they broke arcs into smaller arc segments) or dimensioning (theycreated arrowheads and constructed dimension and witness lines fromprimitives).andP;  The complexity and extra steps of these workarounds, however,made it take much longer to finish each drawing.andM;The testers praised Generic CADD for its accuracy, its ability to preciselylocate points through numeric keyboard input of coordinates and locations,and its symbol facility.andP;  But they disliked its text facilities (which cannotuse Macintosh fonts), slow zooming, and lack of built-in plotter support.andM;Generic CADD Level 1 provides an interesting set of contrasts.andP;  It isextremely inexpensive and compact, fitting easily into nearly any Mac.andP;  Twoconfigurations of Version 1.0 are supplied -- one for the SE and Plus, theother for the Mac II (to take advantage of its floating-point processor).andO;You can get right up to speed using pull-down menus, or you can use atwo-letter shortcut command for nearly every feature.andP;  The program, however,lacks many basic CAD tool -- particularly dimensioning -- and needs to makebetter use of the Mac's existing graphics facilities.andM;For users on a limited budget, Generic CADD Level 1 version 1.0, at $99.95,serves a real purpose.andP;  By the time you read this, however, Generic Softwarewill no longer distribute version 1.0 to its dealers.andP;  The newer version, 1.1(tested in beta form by the Labs), sells for $149.95 and adds some newfacilities.andP;  These include saving files as PICT or EPS, opening PICT files,translating for import/export to/from Generic's DOS version, new snaps(midpoint, object ,and intersection), select all, bulge-arc, and multilinetext placement.andP;  It should be noted that even with these additions, GenericCADD is still spare in features when compared with the other products wetested.andM;Generic CADD Level 1 allows output on standard Mac printers.andP;  Before you canpen-plot with Generic, however, you need to purchase third-partyplotter-driver software (such as MacPlot from Microspot), which will morethan double your software costs.andM;Although the newer version can handle PICT files (for importing or exportingdrawings from other Mac applications), Generic CADD Level 1's inability touse Mac fonts and fills makes it less attractive than the other products.andM;Generic's CADD Level 2 (to sell for $199.95) was announced in mid-1988 butwas unavailable during our tests.andP;  Generic claims it will add such facilitiesas associative dimensioning, full color on a Mac II, arrowhead types, andmany features missing in CADD Level 1.andP;  It won't add Mac fonts or fills,though.andP;  We'll have to wait and see how it performs.andM;DREAMSandM;Innovative Data Design (IDD) delivered its first product, MacDraft, in August1985, beginning the era of 2-d Macintosh CAD.andP;  Now, more than four years and65,000 copies of MacDraft later, we have the company's second-generation CADproduct, DREAMS.andP;  Note that the term CAD is not a part of its name -- a clearattempt by IDD to indicate the broader market this new product targets.andM;DREAMS was first announced to ship in July 1988.andP;  Delivery of DREAMS wasdelayed, however, and did not begin until the fourth quarter.andP;  A family ofoptional symbol libraries, an optional DXF and IGES file-conversion facility,and an optional pen-plotter driver were announced at the same time.andP;  As ofthis writing, a few of the promised symbol libraries were actually available.andM;IDD is aiming DREAMS at an audience wider than traditional CAD users.andP;  Thecompany sees graphic designers, desktop publishing and presentationspersonnel, technical illustrators, interior designers, artists, and educatorsas prospective DREAMS users.andP;  To that end, the company has includedfacilities you don't normally find in any CAD product.andP;  One of these is theability to design custom fill patterns on a 32-x-32 pixel array -- in color,no less -- and to save and store 255 of these patterns.andM;IDD has made a strong attempt to persuade its large base of registeredMacDraft users to upgrade by offering them the $500 DREAMS product for $200.andO;That should appeal to many MacDraft owners, and they won't be disappointed,because DREAMS provides many new capabilities.andM;What this product doesn't share with its more-expensive CAD counsins istraining drudgery.andP;  Of the three products our testers worked with, DREAMSproduced the shortest learning times.andP;  The student testers averaged only 1.7hours, and our professional tester took 2 hours.andP;  Remember, we definedlearning time as the time they spent studying the program, reading the manual(yes, some Mac users occasionally do that), and performing the tutorials togain enough product familiarity to tackel the three test drawings.andM;DREAMS requires a hard disk, because the installed program occupies 851K.andO;Installation is fast and simple.andP;  Although DREAMS can run on 1-megabytesystems, IDD recommends at least 2 megabytes of RAM if you want to use theprogram in color on a Mac II.andM;Our testers rated DREAMS the highest in ease of learning.andP;  They rated itsdocumentation as better than Generic CADD's but not quite as good as ClarisCAD's.andM;The DREAMS user interface is familiar in many ways.andP;  It contains the standardMac menu bar and offers three relocatable palettes -- Draft, Accessory, andDimension.andP;  The Draft palette has well-known tools for creating text, lines,and shapes.andP;  The Accessory palette has facilities for editing graphic objectsand image-manipulation tools for zooming and panning.andP;  The Dimensions palettesupports DREAMS' dimensioning facilities.andM;Two unique capabilities of the package are the ability to add objects to (orsubtract them from) one another and to glue edges to objects or unglue them.andM;DREAMS is far more comprehensive than Generic CADD but not as feature-rich asClaris CAD.andP;  It is a vast improvement over MacDraft (see features chart) andwill be well liked by Mac users, particularly those limited to a softwarepurchase under $500.andM;When, at the end of the test, the student testers were asked which of thethree products they would buy (with their own money, and at list price) oneindicated Generic CADD, five selected Claris CAD, and the remaining fivechose DREAMS.andP;  If we had included price in our other rating factors, DREAMSwould likely have received a better rating.andP;  Compared with Claris CAD, DREAMSscored better per dollar of cost but measurably worse in an absolute sense.andM;Claris CADandM;The third product in our affordable-CAD trilogy comes from Claris, a companyknown more for its best-selling horizontal applications than for CAD.andP;  Clarishas the distinction of being the only CAD developer (on any computerplatform) that also publishes a database program (FileMaker II), wordprocessor (MacWrite), forms product (Smart-Forms), paint program (MacPaint),drawing/graphics product (MacDraw II), and a project-management product(Mac-Project II).andP;  Should the company find a way to integrate thesedisciplines into its CAD offering, Claris would be in an enviable position.andM;Claris gives many of its programs a distinct family look, which is good forpeople learning a new application.andP;  Claris CAD benefits from thisconsistency, sharing many icons, menus, dialog boxes, and other on-screenfacilities with MacDraw II.andP;  It also shares a common pen-plotter facilitywith MacProject.andP;  Claris private-labels this version of MacPlot fromMicrospot and bundles it into each copy of Claris CAD, MacDraw II, andMacProject II.andM;It is tempting but inaccurate to think of Claris CAD as an overgrown and moreexpensive version of MacDraw II.andP;  Claris CAD is a high-quality, full-featured2-D product that will satisfy any 2-D CAD professional.andP;  What separatesClaris CAD from many of its higher-priced professional cousins is not ashortage of CAD features but the fact that you can learn it in a short time.andO;Our student testers spent an average of 2.7 hours with it before starting thethree test drawings, and our professional tester spent 3 hours.andM;A 45-minute, VHS-format videotape, &quot;Claris CAD Tutorial,&quot; is included withevery copy of Claris CAD.andP;  The tape provides a solid background for thecapabilities and operation of the application.andP;  Also included are threemanuals:  a thick User's Guide, a Tutorial Workbook, and a Getting Startedbook.andP;  All are extremely well written, well organized, and profuselyillustrated.andP;  In addition, Claris includes a durable ten-page Quick Referenceto keep beside you Mac.andM;The software ships on three disks: Clalaris CAD, Claris CAD Utilities, andClaris CAD Tutorials.andP;  Claris CAD consumes a whopping 1,060K of your harddisk.andP;  As with DREAMS, a hard disk is required.andM;Although Claris CAD can run on a 1-megabyte system, you should plan on 2megabytes or more if you plan to use color on a Mac II, if you have a largemonitor, or if you use large drawing files.andP;  Performance speed improvesmeasurably as you add RAM.andM;Claris uses a well-crafted interface design, consisting of components calledtools, methods, and modifiers.andP;  Tools are the familiar icons for text, lines,rectangles, circles, and the like.andP;  Methods are facilities for using thetools and include such things as drawing from corner to corner and fromcenter to edge.andP;  Modifiers are specific ways of handling the constructionsteps.andP;  Examples of modifiers are endpoint, center, corner, and tangent.andM;Using tools, modifiers, and methods is simple once you're familiar with theconcept.andP;  To start, you select a tool, select which method you want to usewith it, and finally select the proper modifier for each step.andP;  In this way,you learn a simple syntax that you can apply in 5,000 different combinations.andM;Within Claris CAD is a unique facility for drawing standards andspecifications.andP;  It automatically supports all the major U.S.andP;  andinternational standards for dimensioning and annotation.andP;  Simply pick the oneyou want, and everything -- including text-spacing and placement, metric andnonmetric units, and paper size -- is automatically adjusted.andP;  In addition,you can edit them to create a standard that meets your needs.andM;Our testers gave Claris CAD the highest rating in nearly every categoryacross the board.andP;  It produced the fastest times in nearly every performancetest the Labs conducted.andP;  The ratings are offset by its higher price,however, which proves that you get what you pay for.andP;  At $799 (includingplotter driver) it is the highest-priced proced product we tested but by farthe most capable and powerful.andP;  MacDraw II owners receive a $399 trade-upopportunity.andM;Despite its higher price, Claris CAD deserves careful examination.andP;  It offersmore power but doesn't sacrifices ease of learning in the process.andP;  In thisclass of CAD product, it will be tough to beat.andM;Autodesk to BuyandM;Generic CADDandM;At press time we learned that Autodesk (Sausalito, CA), maker of AutoCAD, hadsigned a letter of intent to purchase Generic Software (Bothell, WA), makerof the Generic CADD product family.andP;  The combined user base of both companiesreportedly exceeds 500,000.andM;If the deal goes through, the actual effects of the merger will bewidespread.andP;  The move would give Autodesk an instant mass-distributionchannel in the U.S.andP;  (which it now lacks) and a new low-end customer basefrom which it could lure future buyers of AutoCAD.andP;  Generic would gaintechnical and financial strength and immediate access to Autodesk'sinternational markets.andM;Both companies would reportedly maintain their separate products andidentities.andP;  Financial details of the acquisition were not released.andM;What You Don't GetandM;Generic CADD Level 1, DREAMS, and Claris CAD are relatively inexpensive andeasy to learn.andP;  At first glance, they seem quite powerful.andP;  But there arenearly 40 other CAD products on the Macintosh market, and a lot of users arepaying $3,000 and more to obtain features that Generic CADD, DREAMS, and evenClaris CAD simply can't offer.andP;  Here's a look at what you don't get.andM;Highest on the list of what you don't get in the tested products is a 3-Ddatabase.andP;  All the applications we tested have 2-D databases.andP;  And, of theseven CAD products on the large Summary of Features chart, only one, VersaCADDrafter, has a 2.5-D (x, y, and z-top/z-bottom) database.andP;  3-D CAD isn't foreveryone, but for those who need it, 2-D and 2.5-D products just won't do.andM;Several 3-D CAD products are available for the Mac.andP;  They start at $495 forMinicad from Graphsoft.andP;  Origins from Deltasoft is $595, Minicad+ $695, andPEGASYS II from IGC Technology $1,795.andP;  They provide some 3-D capability butcome up short.andP;  Let's look instead at some applications with full-blown 3-D.andM;3-D Super-CADandM;Within the past year, some products have been announced that we call 3-Dsuper-CAD.andP;  They come from some of the biggest and most established names inthe CAD industry.andP;  Why didn't we test them? For starters, all but one(Infinite Graphics' IN-CAD) were still in the beta stage.andP;  It would bepremature to review this family of CAD products based solely on ourprerelease copies, but we can share some exciting prospects with you.andM;The four new 3-D super-CAD products for the Macintosh are AutoCAD fromAutodesk ($3,000), IN-CAD from Infinite Graphics ($2,495), MacBRAVO! fromSchlumberger ($1,500 to $2,300), and MicroStation Mac from Intergraph($3,300).andM;That these products come from companies well established in the CAD industrylends credence to the Mac as a viable 3-D CAD platform.andP;  All four havefeatures and capabilities superior to those of older 3-D CAD productsavailable for the Mac and vastly superior to those of the three low-end CADproducts reviewed on these pages.andP;  For example, all have extensive 2-Ddrafting features and sophisticated 3-D modeling, which includes hidden-lineremoval and the creation of shaded 3-D renderings.andP;  In this respect, theyfall into two major 3-D modeling classes: 3-D surface modelers and 3-D solidmodelers.andM;Surface modelers build 3-D objects by defining boundary surfacecharacteristics.andP;  Objects are usually displayed as a mesh of connected linesin wire-frame depiction.andP;  Surfaces may be complex-curved (as with thecontours of an automobile) or may consist of flat or curved planes.andP;  Surfacesmay also combine complex curves with flat or curved planes.andP;  MicroStationMac, AutoCAD, and MacBRAVO! are surface modelers.andP;  MicroStation Mac canproduce shaded 3-D renderings.andP;  AutoCAD can remove hidden lines.andP;  MacBRAVO!andO;up until now has depicted only wire-frame views, although it readily movesbetween 3-D model and 2-D drafting modes.andM;Solid modelers, in contrast, build 3-D objects by using 3-D primitives(cubes, spheres, and the like) and performing Boolean operations (adding themtogether, subtracting one from another) on them to form more-complex 3-Dshapes.andP;  IN-CAD is the only solid modeler of the four Macintosh super-CADproducts.andP;  Its 3-D facilities are extremely well designed and straightforwardto learn and use.andP;  It can produce wire-frame views and fully shaded 3-Drenderings at three user-selectable degrees of precision.andM;Both methods of 3-D modeling have their devotees and critics.andP;  Each excels atcertain tasks.andP;  Airplane and automobile bodies, owing to their complex andirregular shapes, are best designed with 3-D surface modelers.andP;  Machine-partdesigners frequently favor solid modelers.andP;  Both methods work well forarchitectural design.andM;Don't expect to master any of these products in a few hours.andP;  They have morefeatures than any CAD application at your local software store, and they comewith huge manuals that bring new meaning to the word commitment.andP;  Of thefour, IN-CAD and MicroStation Mac are the most Mac-like and should proveeasiest to learn.andM;Infinite Graphics' IN-CAD has 2-D and 3-D operations that closely adhere tocommon interface conventions, letting you master them in a single sitting.andO;But you'll need more time to explore the many other capabilities of thisfeature-rich and versatile application.andP;  Mechanical designers will delight inits 3-D performance.andP;  Excellent documentation lightens the learning load.andM;Integraph's MicroStation Mac is more expensive, but it brings anunprecedented selection of 2-D and 3-D features to the Mac.andP;  It takes fulladvantage of Mac hardware facilities (such as multiple screens) and conformsto the Mac interface.andP;  Examined in prerelease form, each feature appears wellimplemented.andP;  There are so many features in MicroStation Mac that merelyrunning through each one would take more time than our testers spent learningthe low-end packages in this review.andP;  MicroStation Mac seems to be ahigh-quality product.andM;The prerelease version of Schlumberger's MacBRAVO! is far more Mac-like thanAutCAD yet has similar capabilities.andP;  Schlumberger's other MacBRAVO!andO;platforms (BRAVO3 on DEC VAX, for instance) have even more advanced featuresthat will inevitably find their way to the Mac.andM;Although AutoCAD is blessed with many features, Macintosh users will find itslook and feel unfamiliar (unless they've learned AutoCAD on other platforms).andO;But don't worry; Autodesk (creator of AutoCAD) has set up a worldwide networkof training centers, and many schools and universities offer courses on theproduct.andP;  On other platforms, it takes weeks to become familiar withAutoCAD's vast array of features and months to master them.andP;  AutoCAD on theMac seems likely to demand the same lengthy training, but apparently theeffort is worth it, as there are an estimated 200,000 AutoCAD usersworldwide.andM;KudosandM;Kudos to our advisory-panel members: Ted Peters and Lisa Saunders of GenericSoftware, Bruce N. Lee of IDD, and Craig Young and Kyle Mashima of C.A.S.E.andO;Thanks also to our testers: Joe Lewis of General Lift and the students at CalState University,  Northridge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
