Traders and analysts said the U.S. currency is being propelled by an unexpectedly robust U.S. economy and a growing belief in the market that the Federal Reserve Board won't lower U.S. interest rates anytime soon. Higher interest rates tend to increase a currency's allure to international investors.    &quot;The dollar is still in an upward direction despite central-bank intervention,&quot; said Andre Woerhoff, chief mark trader at DG Bank in Frankfurt, West Germany. When central banks sold dollars yesterday to slow the U.S. currency's rise, &quot;most people in the market took it as a chance to buy cheap dollars,&quot; he said. He predicted &quot;we will test the two-mark level&quot; for the dollar, possibly as early as this morning.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9883 marks, up from 1.9780 marks in Europe Monday and 1.9810 marks in New York late Friday before the threeday holiday weekend. The dollar rose to 146.84 yen from 146.13 yen in Tokyo Monday and 145.98 yen in New York late Friday. Meanwhile, the pound fell to $1.5385 from $1.5533 on Monday in London and $1.5500 in New York before the weekend.    The dollar stands well above the upper limits of the trading ranges of 1.70-to-1.90 marks and 120-to-140 yen within which most traders and economists say the Group of Seven major industrial countries have tried to keep the U.S. currency since February 1987. The G-7 includes the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar opened for trading at 146.90 yen, up from 146.65 yen at Tokyo's Tuesday close.    At one point in late European and early New York activity Tuesday, the dollar traded as high as 1.9938 marks and 147.25 yen before falling back on profit taking. Those are its highest levels since mid-June. In intraday trading on June 15, the dollar reached a 31-month high of 2.0475 marks and a 20-month peak of 151.85 yen.    &quot;The mood of the market is to buy dollars and wait for the dollar to go over two marks,&quot; said Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of Chase Manhattan Bank's New York foreign-exchange operations. &quot;It appears that the Germans aren't going to raise their interest rates and that the U.S. isn't going to lower its rates -- in fact, some people expect the Fed to tighten a little -- so the market has been aggressively buying dollars.&quot;    A rising dollar threatens to undermine the four-year-long effort of the U.S. and its major trading partners to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and correspondingly large Japanese and West German surpluses. That is because a higher dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and reduces the price of imports to American consumers.    On the other hand, a rising dollar helps reduce U.S. inflationary pressures. By keeping a lid on import prices, a strong U.S. currency inhibits the ability of U.S. manufacturers to raise domestic prices. Conversely, it also adds to inflationary pressures in other countries with weakening currencies.    The dollar began its climb Tuesday in early Far Eastern trading, but really shot up when European markets opened later in the day. With the dollar trading at 1.9885 marks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- which executes foreign-exchange policy for the U.S. Treasury Department -- and several European central banks began selling dollars for marks in what dealers said was a concerted effort to slow the U.S. currency's ascent.    &quot;Every minute another central bank seemed to come in,&quot; said a trader at a big West German bank.    But dollar sales by the central banks of the U.S., West Germany, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Spain had only a small effect as the dollar quickly rebounded to more than 1.99 marks. &quot;There was little impact -- a little correction -- then the market came back to buy dollars,&quot; said Mr. Woerhoff of DG Bank.    Earlier in Tokyo, when the dollar was changing hands at 145.95 yen, the Bank of Japan sold about $400 million, according to dealers. They said the Fed also sold dollars for marks and yen repeatedly during U.S. trading hours. As is its custom, the Fed declined to confirm or deny whether it had intervened. But in a rare admission, the West German, French, Austrian and Belgian central banks all confirmed they had sold dollars.    Nonetheless, traders said the intervention appeared to be more an attempt to slow the dollar's rise than cap it.    &quot;It wasn't really a decisive action, but was more or less a warning signal to damp the bullish mood,&quot; said Andrew Ruschkowski, a currency-options trader at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. &quot;The market took the dollars immediately and was able to sell them back within 15 to 30 minutes at a profit.&quot; Behind the dollar's recent strength lies a vibrant U.S. economy, relatively firm U.S. interest rates and, as a consequence, a strong appetite by foreign investors for U.S. securities.    Beginning in July, many analysts anticipated the U.S. economy would slow and that the Fed would continue to ease monetary policy. But &quot;now all the economic data coming out since {early} August suggest that the economy is more resilient than initially thought, and that pretty much wiped out any expectation of additional easing,&quot; said Nicholas P. Sargen, an international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.    Specifically, he pointed to the latest Commerce Department estimate that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7% during the second quarter, up from an earlier projection of 1.7%. He also said the latest figures for employment, consumer spending and housing starts were all stronger than analysts expected.    Some traders also mentioned a story in yesterday's Wall Street Journal that said some regional Fed banks were prepared to consider higher U.S. interest rates to combat potential inflation associated with the economy's vigor.    Despite the stronger dollar's potential to damage U.S. exports, some analysts say they believe the Bush Administration doesn't care to see the currency weaken. &quot;There's no interest in the U.S. to see it much lower, but they also don't want a wild rally,&quot; said a dealer at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.    Seiyu Nakao, chief strategist for Nomura Research Institute's U.S. unit in New York, noted that a rising dollar tempers U.S. inflationary pressures. He also said there wasn't much more to be gained from its weakening -- especially against the yen -- after the U.S. currency had already declined for the better part of 4 1/2 years.    While the U.S. is currently running a slight trade surplus with the European Community, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan remains extraordinarily large despite the dollar's 44% fall since March 1985 against the yen. Moreover, Mr. Nakao said a rising U.S. currency might lighten some of the political pressure on the administration by damping the booming foreign appetite for U.S. real estate and corporate acquisitions.    At the same time, currency traders and analysts are beginning to doubt the West German central bank will raise key interest rates at its scheduled meeting tomorrow -- despite the inflationary impact in Germany of a stronger dollar. Several noted recent comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl downplaying the need to raise West German rates.    In a television interview, Mr. Poehl said inflationary pressure in West Germany remained relatively weak despite strong economic growth and that declines in commodity prices -- West Germany is a major oil importer -- were helping to keep inflation down.    In addition, Mr. Sargen of Salomon Brothers said: &quot;Whenever the market has put the most pressure on the Bundesbank to tighten, it has resisted. Instead, it has opted to tighten when the foreign-exchange and money markets have been relatively calm.&quot;    For these reasons, many traders and analysts predict the dollar could continue to rise to about 2.03-to-2.05 marks and 149to-150 yen. But they also say its upside potential is limited.    &quot;We might test those levels, but now we've got too narrow interest-rate spreads {the difference between U.S. and foreign interest rates} to see the dollar break through&quot; them, Mr. Sargen said. Other traders also said that European portfolio managers have tended to lock in profits on their U.S. investments by selling dollars when the currency rises above two marks.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $359.60 an ounce, down $1. Estimated volume was a light 1.1 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was at $358.88 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
