Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, meantime, called thepractice of alterations routine and said changes were made by abudget official ``four or five levels down from the top.''   Dr. James Hansen on Monday told senators that OMB forced him tocontradict within his own prepared statement his finding that abuildup of ``greenhouse effect'' gases would increase thelikelihood of drought.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. praised Hansen for speaking out at theSenate hearing and warned that if administration officials``attempt any kind of retribution in return for candor, they willhave on their hands the congressional equivalent of World War III.''   Gore said this morning on NBC's ``Today'' program that hequestioned President Bush's commitment to the environment, sayingpro-environmentalists in his administration were outnumbered byothers who were pushing a ``do-nothing policy'' on global warming.   ``We should be leading instead of just dragging our feet, andthat's the fault of the president of the United States,'' Gore said.   He said the change in Hansen's testimony ``was an exercise inscience fraud in the sense that they tried to mislead the Congressinto believing that the scientific evidence was not yet good enoughto justify conclusions about the need for action on the greenhouseeffect.''   But Fitzwater said the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration scientist was free to express his own views inanswering committee questions.   ``He's never been muzzled,'' the spokesman insisted. ``He's freeto say whatever he wants.''   In testimony before Gore's science subcommittee of the SenateCommerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Hansen said hewouldn't object to a policy review by OMB. But he added: ``I don'tbelieve the scientific aspects in testimony should be altered. Idid try to get them to compromise. ... I was not successful.''   Fitzwater said scientists inside and outside the governmentdisagree on the global warming issue. He complained that Hansen'soriginal testimony gave the appearance that ``there was unanimitywithin the government on this matter. We simply wanted to point outthat there wasn't.   ``We thought we were commenting on policy, not scientificevidence,'' Fitzwater said.   Hansen complained about the alterations during his response toGore's questions about the changes following submission of thetoned-down written statement.   In the document, Hansen said it was unlikely scientists wouldalter the conclusions of computer models that greenhouse gaseswould increase drought in low and middle latitudes. But thestatement also contradicted the conclusion by saying _ in languageinserted by OMB _ that the computer models were not reliable.   Hansen said officials also added a sentence that said it wasunknown whether the buildup of greenhouse gases was from naturalforces or from human activities. Hansen and others at the hearingsaid humans were primarily responsible by burning fossil fuel,cutting down tropical rain forests and other actions.   ``Every scientist that testified here today ... and everyreputable scientist in the field supports your conclusion this isprimarily a human cause. It's not an act of God. OMB forced you tosay it may ... be just the forces of nature,'' Gore said.   ``They're acting as if they're scared of the truth,'' thesenator added. ``It's a form of scientific fraud by them. ... Theadministration does not want to act. It wants to sit still and donothing.''   The development came two days after it became known that theWhite House had rebuffed the suggestions of William Reilly, head ofthe Environmental Protection Agency, and other officials that theU.S. government call for an international convention on globalwarming.   Another government scientist, Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman of theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he had asimilar experience with the budget office in congressionaltestimony he prepared in February.   Mahlman said he successfully fought changes that would have been``embarrassing to me'' in facing his fellow scientists, and toldsenators, ``If we do not have the right to be wrong, we havesquelched the right to be creative.''   The greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earth'satmosphere trap radiant heat near the planet's surface. In additionto natural buildup, the gases have increased dramatically becauseof burning coal, oil, and gas, as well as the destruction oftropical rain forests.</TEXT></DOC>
