The wide-ranging study also hailed ``remarkable changes in theSoviet Union'' under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the pastyear.   The report criticized Israeli troops for practices that resultedin ``many avoidable deaths and injuries'' during the 14-monthuprising.   From time to time since the violence started in the occupiedterritories, the State Department has expressed criticism of Israeliefforts to bring it under control, but the report appeared to gobeyond the earlier statements.   The report said Israeli authorities in some cases prosecuted ortook disciplinary action against soldiers or settlers who had killedPalestinians.   But it added, ``Regulations were not rigorously enforced;punishments were usually lenient, and there were many cases ofunjustified killing that did not result in disciplinary actions orprosecutions.''   The Palestinian uprising, which began in December 1987, caughtthe Israeli army ``by surprise,'' the report said. The armed forces,``untrained and inexperienced in riot control, responded in a mannerwhich led to a substantial increase in human rights violations,'' itsaid.   Criticism of the Israel reaction to the uprising also was raisedon Capitol Hill today by the private human rights group AmnestyInternational and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.   In a report to the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreignoperations, Amnesty International said that while both sides haveused violence in the Palestinian uprising which began in December1987, there have been excesses on the Israeli side.   ``Demonstrators have thrown rocks and Molotov cocktails,'' thereport said. ``However, the tactics of the Israeli army haveexceeded the use of reasonable force.''   It said there have been ``hundreds of questionable killings'' byIsraeli security forces and that few have been adequatelyinvestigated.   Amnesty International and the lawyers committee questioned theuse of high velocity bullets by the Israeli forces as well as theuse of plastic bullets which the two organizations said can belethal.   Citing figures compiled by the press, Palestinians and theIsraeli government, the State Department report said ``366Palestinians were killed in 1988 as a result of the uprising, mostof the by the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces), some by Israelisettlers. ... Over 20,000 Palestinians were wounded or injured bythe IDF.''   The report found that 11 Israelis had been killed in the uprisingand approximately 1,100 injured.   The 1,560-page report on conditions in more than 160 nations wasprepared for submission to Congress and public release on Wednesday.However, some accounts appeared in newspapers today.   On the changes in the Soviet Union, the report said, ``We stillcannot say that there has been a fundamental shift in the SovietUnion's approach to human rights, but there is no doubt that thechanges in evidence in 1988 have profound implications, as advocatesof significant systemic reform appear to have gained strength.''   By the end of 1988, all Soviet citizens who had been punished forpolitical dissent or unauthorized religious activity had been setfree, the report said. It added that plans for amendment or repealof statutes limiting political and religious activity have beenannounced and that the practice of placing political dissidents inmental hospitals is being curbed.   Elsewhere, the report cited ``significant further advances'' inHungary and Poland toward a more open society, and added that theOctober plebiscite in Chile generated hope that for a peacefulreturn to democracy in that country.   The report said that some of the most significant human rightsviolations took place in Iraq, Burundi and Sudan.   ``In each of these situations, innocent civilian bystanders diedas a result of guerrilla warfare or reprisals for violence byothers,'' it said.   It accused Iraq of employing chemical warfare against Kurdishrebels, killing and injuring thousands of civilians and causing tensof thousands to flee.   An estimated 5,000 to 10,000 civilians were killed during ethnicviolence in Burundi, in East Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
