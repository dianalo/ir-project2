The company said its prescription drug sales accounted for77% of its overall sales during the year, with consumerhealth care items making up the rest. The anti-viral productsZovirax, Retrovir and Wellferon, which is increasingly beingused to treat viral hepatitis, accounted for 41% of grouprevenue, Wellcome said. Overall prescription drug salestotaled #1.23 billion during the fiscal year.   It said 44% of its sales were in the U.S. and Canada,totaling #711 million. In local currency terms, it said, U.S.sales were up 17% at $1.17 billion. European sales were #494million, or 31% of overall sales. Growth in Italy at 38% andGermany at 22% was particularly strong, Wellcome said.   Japanese sales were 20% higher at #105 million, exceeding#100 million for the first time, Wellcome said.   Wellcome said Exosurf, a drug to treat respiratorydistress syndrome in premature infants, recorded sales of #22million in its first full year on the market.   The company said its spending on research and developmentrose #9 million during the year to #230 million, and that&quot;notable progress&quot; has been made on two new antiherpeticagents, 882C and 256U, which are follow-up compounds toZovirax.   It also cited progress in a new anti-infective agent,556C, which would be used in the treatment of pneumocystiscarinii pneumonia, one of the major opportunistic infectionssuffered by people with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiencysyndrome.   The Sudafed tampering incident in the state of Washington,in which two people died, led to an extraordinary loss of#6.7 million, the company said. Wellcome's U.S. unit,Burroughs Wellcome, was forced to recall its Sudafed 12-hourcapsules for a short time in February when a small numberwere replaced on shelves with capsules containing the poisonsodium cyanide.   The loss was more than offset, however, by the disposal ofbusinesses during the year, and Wellcome reported an overallextraordinary gain of #1.4 million. It had an extraordinaryloss of #13.7 million a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
