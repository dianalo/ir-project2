Because the materialis much more tenaciously retained in the lung than ``normal'' class Ymaterial, the Hanford Internal Dosimetry Program has been referring toit as ``super'' class Y. This material poses some major challenges withregard to the design and operation of bioassay monitoring programs. Becauseof the relative completeness of their data, 10 cases that show lung retentionhalf-times in excess of 5000 days are of particular interest. However,the bioassay data for these cases span the past 30 years and involvevarious sampling methods and detection limits in vogue at the time. Furthermore,the data were collected for the purpose of determining compliance withregulations in place at the time, rather than for research or modelingof clearance pathways and rates. So from a modeling perspective, thedata have gaps, but are sufficiently complete to be convincing. 3 refs.,2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
