Separately, the convenience-store retailer said second-quarter net income fell 42%, to $47.5 million, or 93 cents a share, from $81.6 million, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier. The company attributed much of the decline to continuing costs from new marketing programs at its 7-Eleven stores and the cost of remodeling stores and opening new ones.    As part of the settlement of about 10 lawsuits filed in state district court in Dallas, Thompson Co. agreed to increase the second tier of its offer to exchange $61.32 and 0.6672 share of a new, $25 exchangeable junior preferred share in Southland, with a stated value of $16.68, for each Southland common share owned. Previously, Thompson, controlled by three sons of the company's founder, had offered 0.6272 share of the new preferred, with a stated value of $15.68.    As previously reported, Thompson has a tender offer outstanding to buy 31.5 million Southland common shares for $77 a share. The offer expires Friday. Common shares that aren't purchased will be exchanged for the combination of new preferred and cash.    The company said the sweetened offer gives the proposal a blended value of $72 cash and $5.33 in preferred stock.    The lawsuits had sought to block the offer, charging that Southland hadn't fulfilled its fiduciary duty to shareholders. The settlement is subject to court approval and completion of the merger.    In reporting its earnings, Southland said its second-quarter results include $25.6 million from its half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., a refining concern. Revenue for the quarter was $2.45 billion, up 11% from $2.21 billion a year earlier.    For the six months, Southland had net of $72.5 million, or $1.39 a share, compared with a loss of $6.9 million the year before. The first half of this year includes a $23.3 million pre-tax gain from sale of a half-interest in Citgo; the year-before period includes a $154 million pre-tax write-down of Citgo refined product inventories.    Revenue for the six months rose 7.8%, to $4.55 billion from $4.22 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
