(DEC), the world's leading manufacturer of networkedcomputer systems and peripherals, has an ambitious plan to tie together allof the major computing platforms.andP;  The company's NAS (NEtwork ApplicationSupport) strategy is a set of standards that makes it easy to exchange databetween unlike systems.andM;Although most of its key software runs on mainframes and minicomputers, NASprimarily benefits the businessperson who uses a PC.andP;  Business professionalswho are comfortable with microcomputers may know little about DEC and mayfind impenetrable the jargon that surrounds NAS.andP;  The solutions that NASprovides, however, are simple to use.andM;The Multiplatform GameandM;The principle of NAS is to draw multiple computer environments into acoherent and cohesive whole.andP;  Coherence comes from standard file formats andinterfaces that allow each application to access and manipulate data createdin other applications.andP;  Cohesiveness derives from sharing resources amongapplications, regardless of the systems on which they run.andP;  This is no smalltask, given the diversity of systems in most workplaces.andM;DEC is not alone in this market.andP;  IBM and other minicomputer vendors havejoined in.andP;  Systems Network Architecture (SNA) and Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) represent IBM's foray into multiplatform connectivity.andO;Historically, DEC has been more aggressive than IBM in encompassing othervendors' machines and operating systems.andM;For several reasons, DEC is a leader in multiplatform networking.andP;  First,most DEC machines run under a common operating system, VMS.andP;  You can freelymove an application among DEC systems.andP;  If a database application youdeveloped for eight users outgrows a small VAX minicomputer, you can easilymove it to a larger VAX or add another VAX.andP;  You can tie two or more VAXestogether in a cluster configuration without altering the application.andP;  Incontrast, IBM's AS/400 minicomputers and 370-series mainframes use differentoperating systems, so you may need to modify your applications software whenyou move it between systems.andM;Second, an increasing number of software products adhere to DEC's NASstandard.andP;  DEC has enlisted over 75 software companies to develop versions oftheir popular programs to run under NAS.andP;  These companies include LotusDevelopment Corp., Ashton-Tate Corp., and WordPerfect Corp. DEC software alsoprovides extensive support for the Macintosh environment, and Apple Computerrecently announced its CL/1 Server for VAX/VMS.andM;Third, DEC excels at both local and wide area networks.andP;  DECnet allows anyuser to access any computer across a worldwide network.andP;  This advantage hasmade VAX a leading computer environment for multinational corporations withglobal networks and strong communication needs.andM;Fourth, hooking up any device to a DEC system is easy and inexpensive.andP;  Manypopular PC communication-software packages provide VT100 or VT200 terminalemulation, which allows your PC to emulate a DEC terminal.andM;Inside NASandM;NAS is based on a client-server model.andP;  The VAX, under the VMS operatingsystem, acts as a clearinghouse for client stations that request applicationsor data.andP;  The clients are PCs, workstations, or terminals that run underMS-DOS, OS/2, Macintosh, VMS, or Ultrix (DEC's version of Unix) operatingsystems.andP;  Each client operates in its native mode.andP;  A DOS-based PC, forexample, operates as a PC, not as a dumb terminal.andM;NAS consists of a series of software toolkits, application programminginterfaces, and run-time libraries that integrate applications across anetwork of multivendor systems.andP;  The benefit of NAS to the user is directaccess to any hardware or software resource that's available on the network.andM;Conventional network services include file sharing, printing, andcommunicating through electronic bulletin boards and E-mail.andP;  To these, NASadds Compound Document Architecture (CDA) and Structured Query Language (SQL)capability.andM;CDA specifies a set of conventions, protocols, and standard file formats forcreating compound documents.andP;  The documents can include text, spreadsheets,graphics, and scanned images from many different applications.andP;  Theindividual pieces of a compound document can maintain a live link to theapplication in which they were created.andP;  This lets you automatically updatethe compound document.andM;You can display a compound document in its original format on differentsystems.andP;  The data, in the form of graphics, text, or database records,doesn't lose its original formatting or its special characteristics.andM;DEC's SQL/Services allows client applications to access and manipulatedatabase information on any mini or mainframe server via theindustry-standard query language, SQL.andP;  For example, by utilizing VAXSQL-Services and Lotus's DataLens technology, users of 1-2-3 for VAX/VMS and1-2-3 for All-In-1 will be able to pull data directly into their spreadsheetsfrom VAX Rdb/VMS databases and other VAX and IBM databases.andM;The communication between systems is handled behind the scenes by the NASsoftware.andP;  The individual user does not have to become involved in thetechnical details.andM;Integrated Office SystemsandM;Two current DEC products, PCSA and All-In-1, complement DEC's NAS software.andM;PCSA, for Personal Computing System's Architecture, is software that allowsPC and VAX users to share files that are stored on a VAX.andP;  With it, yourPC-based software can use the VAX's disk storage as if it were your PC's harddisk.andP;  For example, if you use 1-2-3 Release 3 on a PC, you can issue theFile Save command to save a worksheet file to the VAX.andP;  A user of a VAX-basedversion of 1-2-3 can then use the File Retrieve command to retrieve the file.andM;All-In-1, DEC's popular integrated office system, is a hybrid of a menu shellprogram, a macro language, and a set of office tools.andM;1-2-3 for All-In-1 supports All-In-1's keystroke and filing conventions andcan be one of the tools that you select from the All-In-1 menu.andP;  DEC recentlyannounced the All-In-1 Phase II program, which includes NAS services.andP;  Thisnew version expands All-In-1 from a single product to a group of productsthat provide a set of office applications and services for a wide variety ofdesktop devices.andM;Products in the All-In-1 Desktop family, such as All-In-1 Desktop for MS-DOS,let you run applications on your computer and simultaneously use the networkapplications that are available through the All-In-1 integrated officesystem.andM;To Market, To MarketandM;DEC has a well-earned reputation for technical excellence and for meetingcustomer challenges.andP;  But DEC has some handicaps when it comes to selling itsvision of the future.andP;  To begin with, MIS department managers may be wary oftaxing their systems with CPU-intensive applications that benefit PC users.andO;And because of IBM's overwhelming presence in the business world, MISmanagers are more likely to turn to Big Blue for guidance in corporatecomputing.andM;DEC also has a less-than-enviable track record when it comes to addressingthe needs and concerns of the microcomputer community.andP;  DEC entered the PCmarket at roughly the same time as IBM, but the DEC Rainbow and DECProfessional earned virtually no market share.andP;  DEC's current IBM-compatibleVAXmate has fared only slightly better.andP;  Add to this a marketing force thatis perceived as overly technical and reluctant to give discounts, and youhave a picture of the roadblocks that face DEC.andM;Another challenge to DEC is that PC vendors are creating systems that rivalthe minicomputer.andP;  Compaq Computer Corp. claims that its Systempro isequivalent to a small VAX in memory and storage and that it is faster than aVAX.andM;On the up side, DEC's marketing slant for NAS is clearly oriented towardbuilding bridges, not fences.andP;  NAS embraces the idea that information systemsoften grow bit by bit from a variety of vendors.andP;  Obsolescence means moneylost, so MIS managers should welcome the opportunity to extend the usefullife of their current equipment.andP;  Most large companies currently have somemixture of computing environments.andP;  DEC hopes to provide the umbrella tocover all of them.andM;Gideon Ansell is a senior design-verification engineer at Lotus DevelopmentCorp.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
