Students at three Natal province universities defied policebanning orders and held rallies to declare outlawed studentorganizations would operate openly. Eight students were held brieflyand six were charged with attending illegal gatherings.   Several hundred sturdents at each university clashed with policewho came to the campuses to halt the rallies, part of a nationalcampaign to disregard banning orders placed on organizations duringthe 3-year-old national emergency.   Police fired tear gas and turned a water cannon on students andstaff at the multiracial University of Natal-Durban, after a crowdof more than 1,000 refused several orders to disperse. A studentleader shouting over a megaphone declared the End ConscriptionCampaign and the South African National Students Congress``unbanned'' as he ran from squads of police scattering the crowd.   Students at the white University of Natal-Pietermaritzburgencountered police when they marched off-campus with placardsproclaiming the two organizations ``unbanned.'' Police alsodisrupted a rally at the mostly-Indian University ofDurban-Westville, where students danced and chanted in celebrationof the ``unbanning.''   ``The past few days have been marked by a systematic pattern ofrepression by the state against the defiance campaign,'' said CasCoovadia of the banned United Democratic Front, the country'slargest opposition coalition.   ``The detention of our leaders and the banning of our meetingsserves to strengthen our spirit of resistance,'' Coovadia said in astatement. He added that he had gone into hiding, but did not nameany others who had done so.   There have been reports of several activists dissapearing sinceFriday when police arrested Mohhamed Valli Moosa, the actingsecretary-general of the United Democratic Front and a chieforganizer of the defiance campaign. He was held under emergencyregulations that allow police to keep him in custody infefinitelywithout charge.   Leon Mellet, spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, indirectlyconfirmed that activists were hiding. ``It is ironic that they unbanthemselves and then immediately go underground,'' he said.   He said ``a number'' of people who had defied the law had beenarrested and ``when they sit alone in a police cell, they must blamethose faceless people who irresponsibly urged them to defy the law.''   The defiance campaign which began Aug. 2 has been escalating inthe days leading up to Sept. 6 parliamentary elections that excludethe 28 million-member black majority.   Police responded by breaking up several weekend anti-apartheidrallies, including a march by blacks at a ``whites-only'' beach atCape Town and a demonstration at the University of the Witwatersrandin Johannesburg. The chairman of the Johannesburg rally said majorspeakers from the UDF had not arrived Sunday because they were inhiding.   Police said an ``unsatisfactorily high'' number of unrestincidents had occurred over the weekend in the Cape Town area, andthat police would continue to use whatever action neccessary to curbsuch protests.   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu condemned the police use ofwhips, dogs, and tear gas to keep blacks off the beaches Saturday.   ``In my experience it is the police who have been creating`unrest.' Whenever they keep away from an event, it goes offpeacefully. Whenever they arrive with their quirts, tear gas andfirearms and try to prevent people from peacefully expressing theirdissent, they precipitate confrontation and violence,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
