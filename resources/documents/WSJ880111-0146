Sweeping revisions of its world-wide supply and demand figures by the International Energy Agency suggest that petroleum consumption has been widely understated by more than a million barrels a day.    In new figures officially released today, the Paris-based agency estimates that oil consumption in the non-communist world averaged 48.6 million barrels a day in 1987, up 800,000 barrels a day, or 1.7%, from the IEA's revised estimate for 1986 consumption.    More importantly, the agency's latest calculation of demand is 1.2 million barrels a day higher than the IEA had been estimating for 1987 oil consumption as recently as a month ago -- a huge adjustment in the delicately balanced oil industry. Also, the IEA is increasing an earlier forecast for consumption in the first quarter of this year to 50.2 million barrels a day.    Such major adjustments in the IEA's oil-demand estimates have broad implications for oil consumers as well as producers, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The agency's supply and demand reports are closely watched by both governments and corporations, many of which use them as the basis for their planning. Indeed, figures released by the IEA, which coordinates energy policies among 21 industrial nations, are considered the world's &quot;official&quot; petroleum statistics.    As a result of the IEA's new higher estimates of demand, some oil traders foresee a firming of petroleum prices. &quot;I'm unzipping my bear suit,&quot; said the chief trader for one major U.S. oil company.    But some oil economists maintain that the agency is simply getting its demand estimates into line with those of several major oil companies and industry consultants. &quot;It doesn't change the physical world,&quot; said Thomas Burns, manager of the economic staff at Chevron Corp. &quot;We've been typically higher&quot; on demand estimates, he noted. Chevron has been estimating that 1987 petroleum demand totaled 47.8 million barrels a day, up from 47.3 million in 1986.    In releasing its revised data, the IEA conceded that its demand figures previously had &quot;tended to be at the lower end of the wide range of publicly available estimates.&quot;    As previously reported, earlier hints of the upward revisions in the IEA's estimates already have stirred new debate over the amount of oil that OPEC will be able to produce in the months ahead, and also have raised questions about the true size of the world oil glut, as measured by petroleum inventories.    Most oil analysts and traders still maintain that the world will need far less OPEC oil in the first quarter than the volumes implied in the new IEA report. By coincidence, the agency's figures appear closely in line with current estimates of OPEC production totaling between 17.5 million and 18 million barrels a day. But because of high world-wide oil stockpiles, demand for OPEC crude in the first quarter actually will total closer to 15 million or 16 million barrels a day, according to Steven P. LaBonte, a Denver-based oil trader who bases his projection on studies of historic patterns of demand for the exporters' oil.    The IEA report doesn't specifically forecast demand for OPEC oil in the coming months. It does, however, project both world oil demand, 50.2 million barrels a day, and total non-OPEC supplies, 28.3 million barrels a day, for the first three months of 1988.    The difference of 21.9 million barrels a day would have to be met with OPEC production and by withdrawals from petroleum inventories. OPEC normally produces about 1.7 million barrels a day of natural gas liquids that are used in world petroleum demand, still leaving 20.2 million barrels a day of crude oil to be met by OPEC production and by stock drawdowns in the consuming countries in the first quarter.    According to industry estimates, inventory withdrawals averaged 1.5 million barrels a day in the comparable 1987 and 1986 periods, but that could increase by one million barrels a day this quarter. That, in turn, would leave the need for OPEC oil at 17.7 million barrels a day, as suggested by the IEA world-demand figures.    For all of 1987, the IEA's new figures show 800,000 barrels a day in inventory withdrawals -- after a zero change in 1986. &quot;If that's correct, inventories at both year-end 1986 and 1987 were lower, and the market is much tighter, than believed,&quot; one oil analyst said. The IEA noted, in fact, that the net effect of the increased historical consumption patterns indicated by its revisions is &quot;a greater decrease in global stocks than that previously shown.&quot;    Most oil economists maintain, however, that there still is a huge surplus of above-ground stocks of petroleum. &quot;Inventories are clearly high,&quot; Chevron's Mr. Burns said.    According to the latest tabulation by the Washington-based Energy Security Analysis, which monitors movements of oil world-wide, inventories of crude oil and chief petroleum products, including government stocks, totaled 3.66 billion barrels at the end of November. That was up 110 million barrels from a year earlier.    With government stocks excluded, commercial inventories at the end of November were equal to an 84-day supply, compared with 83 days a year earlier and only 79 days in November 1985 &quot;when the industry was operating hand-to-mouth,&quot; said Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis. Currently, he added, &quot;we see three to four days (of supply) more than needs to be in the system.&quot;    The IEA backdated its revisions through the year 1973, drawing particular attention to oil demand in the Third World. &quot;With developing countries accounting for a rising share of world oil consumption -- 13% in 1973, over 20% in 1986 -- increasing priority has been given to analyzing this area,&quot; the IEA noted. &quot;One conclusion from the revised data is that oil trade between the developing countries, including OPEC, was greater than previously estimated.&quot;    Production also was studied. But the estimates of consumption for recent years were increased more than estimates of supply. &quot;This is a technical adjustment,&quot; Marcel Kramer, head of the IEA's oil industry division, said in an interview. &quot;We have identified more consumption and a bit more supply.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
