As previously reported, the maker of heavy vehicles acquired a 17.2% Trico stake in November, and said then in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it might seek control of the Gardena, Calif.-based maker of oil-extraction equipment. Paccar subsequently sought SEC approval to increase its Trico stake to more than 25%.    Trico on Wednesday also granted Paccar an option to buy as many as 1.5 million newly issued shares at $7.375 each. Such options tend to lock out other potential bidders.    Paccar said the tentative agreement is subject, among other things, to signing of a definitive agreement and approval by Trico shareholders. Trico said that upon signing of a definitive agreement, it will withdraw the &quot;poison pill&quot; shareholder rights plan it adopted last month.    A Paccar spokesman said the company thinks Trico's operations will make &quot;a good fit&quot; with the company's current lines. Paccar said it has &quot;no immediate plans&quot; to change current management at Trico, which is expected to operate as an autonomous unit.    Trico said holders will vote on the plan at a special meeting &quot;in the near future.&quot;    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, Trico shares closed at $7.625, up 25 cents. Paccar shares closed in national over-the-counter trading at $46.75, off 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
