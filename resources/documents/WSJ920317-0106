In trading on New York's Commodity Exchange, gold forMarch delivery settled $3.40 an ounce lower at $343.30. Thedecline marked the third consecutive trading day of lossesfor gold futures. After dropping as low as $342.10, theactively traded April contract settled $3.40 lower at $343.90an ounce.</LP><TEXT>   Other precious metals also suffered from the sell-off ingold. Silver futures for March delivery settled at $4.062 anounce, 3.7 cents lower while the actively traded May contractfinished at $4.087, down 3.8 cents. Platinum futures forApril delivery, meanwhile, settled at $360.50 an ounce, 50cents lower.   Gold was depressed by &quot;technically based selling thatstarted out in Asia and Middle East, and then carried on toNew York,&quot; said Jeffrey M. Christian, managing director atCPM Group, a New York precious metals consulting company.   Some analysts said that producer selling was to blame foryesterday's sharp decline in prices. But other traders, whodeclined to be identified, attributed the drop in futuresprices to selling by a Middle Eastern investor who has beenquietly working to liquidate his gold holdings throughEuropean brokers.   William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at MerrillLynch andamp; Co., said the performance of gold yesterdayhighlights &quot;the inherent weakness of the metals.&quot; Mr. O'Neillnoted that gold failed to rally even though there isconsiderable uncertainty surrounding the referendum today inSouth Africa.   Instead, &quot;what we have seen is a continual series of lowerlows and lower highs&quot; in gold's performance recently, saidMr. O'Neill. He added that the two factors preventing anadvance in gold are continued selling by producers and thewidespread belief that gold is an unattractive investment ina period of low inflation. In the past, gold has attractedinvestors as a hedge against inflation.   David Lundgren, a senior technical analyst at TechnicalData, said that investors interested in profiting from therecent moves in gold should let the dust settle.   Even though the spurt of buying near the close suggeststhat this may be a &quot;sell-off low,&quot; Mr. Lundgren said &quot;itwould be wise {for investors} to sit on the sidelines and getmore information based on the price action&quot; in the next fewdays.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices rose as tradersanticipated widespread retailer beef purchases to meetgrowing consumer demand.

ENERGY: Petroleum prices were mostly flat. Crude oil waslower in U.S. futures trading, although it held above thepsychological support level of $19 a barrel reached in lastweek's rally. There was little news to affect oil marketsexcept for confirmation that the next round of talks betweenIraq and the United Nations on a possible emergency sale ofIraqi oil is scheduled to be held in a few days in Vienna. Onthe New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for Aprildelivery settled down three cents a barrel at $19.15, whilethe May contract was seven cents lower at $19.28.

Coffee for March deliveryended at 72.55 cents a pound, down 0.95 cent. The activelytraded May contract finished at 73.40 cents, down 0.50 cent.The declines came despite a report that Central Americancoffee producers were meeting with a U.S. trade official toseek Washington's support for new international coffeequotas. After seeming like an impossible goal, the idea ofsetting up an international coffee quota system has receivedsome support in recent days. This development has helped fuela run-up in coffee futures. Dario Sarmiento, director atSarmiento Group, a coffee consulting concern, said futuresprices were depressed yesterday by profit-taking. Alsoweighing on the market is uncertainty about Brazil's positionon quotas. Brazil has indicated that it will release astatement by tomorrow clarifying its stance, Mr. Sarmientosaid.</TEXT></DOC>
