The pharmaceutical company said both the stock split and the dividend are payable May 1 to stock of record April 6. On a post-split basis, the dividend will be 15 cents a share.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Upjohn stock jumped $7 a share to close at $125.    The company's stock has been rising in the past year because of Upjohn's increased profitability and investor interest in Upjohn's minoxidil hair treatment. Upjohn has asked the Food and Drug Administration to allow it to market minoxidil in the U.S. as a lotion that the company says helps treat baldness.    In all 1986, Upjohn's profit jumped 24% to $252.6 million, or $4.06 a share, from year-earlier earnings of $203 million, or $3.29 a share, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split paid May 1, 1986.    Sales in the year rose 14% to $2.28 billion from $2.01 billion.    R.T. Parfet Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said the stock split and dividend increase reflect &quot;our current performance and continued confidence in the future of Upjohn Co.&quot; He added that &quot;this action will position our stock in a trading range that makes it more accessible to the individual investor.&quot;    The company has about 62 million shares outstanding. Upjohn said its board also agreed to increase authorized common stock to 600 million shares from the current 200 million shares. Shareholders will vote on the share increase at the annual meeting in May. </TEXT></DOC>
