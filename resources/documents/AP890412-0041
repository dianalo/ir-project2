(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The ``promised land'' for HeritageMinistries lies not at the Christian retreat formerly controlled bytelevision evangelist Jim Bakker but for now across the border inNorth Carolina, its president said.   The ministry will relocate to Charlotte, N.C., but ultimatelyplans to settle in South Carolina, Sam Johnson announced Tuesday ata news conference at the Heritage USA television studios.   The ministry has made down payments on two tracts of land inNorth and South Carolina totaling more than 100 acres and worthnearly $5 million, Johnson said.   Heritage Ministries is the non-profit television ministry spunoff from the bankruptcy reorganization of the PTL ministry inAugust.   The ministry and the separate Heritage Church, of which Johnsonis pastor, are based in Fort Mill at Heritage USA, the 2,200-acreretreat Bakker once controlled.   ``Amusement is a wonderful thing,'' Johnson said. ``A familypark is a wonderful thing. Mr. Bakker had a wonderful dream but itwent awry through mismanagement and misappropriations and for thatwe have all paid and are paying dearly.''   Heritage Ministries offered to purchase some of the propertiesit leases for $80,000 a month from the former PTL corporation, suchas the television studio, following bankruptcy proceedings.   But Stephen Mernick, the Toronto businessman who bought PTL'sassets for $65 million in December, was unreceptive, Johnson said.   Johnson said he informed Mernick of the ministry's plans to moveon Monday.   The ministry will leave Heritage USA by July 1 for a nearly20-acre site of three lots in south Charlotte, Johnson said.   A church on the site will serve as the home for the HeritageChurch, which has about 600 adult members, and as the studio forthe television ministry, Johnson said.   The ministry also has made a $10,000 deposit on 88 acres ofundeveloped land in South Carolina's York County worth $2.5 million.   Johnson said the ministry also has an option to purchase anadditional 25 acres at the site.   The two sites are within miles of the ministry's currentheadquarters.   The ministry's ``more permanent home'' will be in York County,where Fort Mill is located, but it has not set a timetable fordevelopment of the site, Johnson said.   The most important concern for the ministry, Johnson said, israising the money to finance the resettlement.   One likely source is $5.5 million donated by Heritage Ministriessupporters when the ministry was considering bidding on PTL beforeMernick's purchase. The ministry plans a campaign this weekend toreach those contributors.   ``We believe that most of the money, if not all of it ... willbe released to help us relocate and cross the river Jordan andenter the promised land,'' Johnson said.   More contributions could come in from supporters who have waitedfor the ministry to announce its plans, Johnson said.   PTL filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, three months after Bakkerresigned amid revelations that he had a sexual relationship withchurch secretary Jessica Hahn and later arranged payments ofministry money to buy her silence.   Mernick began joint operation of Heritage USA, which includes ahotel and theme park, with bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Bentonon Feb. 13, but has yet to close on the sale.</TEXT></DOC>
