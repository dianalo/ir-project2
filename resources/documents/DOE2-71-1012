The measurement results allow statementson wind characteristics, in particular for large-scale wind power plantsas indicated by data obtained with the wind measurement grid in two spatialcoordinates. The majority of measurements were performed on the hub toexamine the material damage which finally resulted in a restriction ofplant operation to 500 h. The generator system featuring speed variabilityfunctioned well almost from the beginning and allowed soft coupling tothe wind power supplied. Operational management and control of the plantrevealed a level of operational safety and reliability in its first optimizationstage which was high for such a trial plant. Noise emission by the GROWIANplant was too high for permanent operation, especially at night. However,the safety systems managed functional failures at all times.</TEXT></DOC>
