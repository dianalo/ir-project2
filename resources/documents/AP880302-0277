Stevens andamp; Co., months ago a rumoredtakeover target, now finds itself fielding three rival offers froma management-led group, industry competitor West Point-PepperellInc. and an undisclosed suitor.   West Point-Pepperell said Tuesday it had offered to pay $56 ashare for Stevens, or about $867 million, in a negotiated buyout.   The textile company actually had delivered its offer to Stevenslate Monday.   On Tuesday, the J.P. Stevens management group led by ChairmanWhitney Stevens said it was increasing its own outstandingleveraged buyout offer to $55 a share in cash and securities, orabout $850 million.   Stevens also disclosed it had received a third, unidentifiedoffer.   Stevens stock jumped $6.25 a share to $54.50 Tuesday on the NewYork Stock Exchange. West Point-Pepperell was unchanged at $30.50 ashare.   The management group offered to pay $40 in cash and $15 insecurities for each of Stevens' 15.5 million common sharesoutstanding in a leveraged buyout.   The group, led by the fifth generation member of the family thatfounded Stevens in 1813, initially offered on Feb. 8 to pay a totalof $43 a share in cash and securities, or about $666.5 million.   West Point said its $56 a share cash offer was not conditionedon the availability of financing and indicated it was consideringthe sale of certain Stevens assets to avoid antitrust concerns.   Stevens indicated in a news release that its outside directorswere reviewing the revised management proposal and had authorizedthe company's financial advisers to study the two outside proposals.   Jim Franklin, a spokesman for Stevens, declined to commentbeyond the news release.   A number of industry experts had predicted higher offers wouldemerge following the management group's initial offer, which widelywas viewed as too low.   Stevens is one of the nation's biggest textile producers,concentrating on home fashion textiles such as sheets, towels andcarpets under the brand names Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley and PierreCardin. The company also makes automotive products and industrialfabrics.   West Point, based in West Point, Ga., also is a major householdfabrics maker, producing brands such a Arrow, Martex, LadyPepperell, Burberry's and Cabin Crafts.   Joseph L. Lanier Jr., chairman of West Point-Pepperell, said anacquisition of Stevens would be a natural step in his company'sshift toward consumer goods and away from commodity textiles, whichhave lower profit margins and suffer from intense foreigncompetition.   West Point-Pepperell acquired Cluett-Peabody andamp; Co. in 1986 aspart of the strategy.   Stevens undertook a similar strategy beginning in 1984, movingout of apparel fabrics and shifting its manufacturing to hometextiles such as sheets and towels. The success of that effort isone factor that made Stevens an attractive takeover target.   ``That's one of the great strengths of J.P. Stevens,'' Laniersaid in an interview. ``It's playing to our strength as we see it.''   During the quarter ended Jan. 30, Stevens posted an after-taxprofit of $12.9 million, up from $11.9 million a year earlier.Sales rose to $381.48 million from $361.67 million a year earlier.   In the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, Stevens earned $56 million onsales of $1.6 billion. This compared with a profit of $53.7 millionon revenue of $1.68 billion in 1986.   West Point-Pepperell reported a profit of $25.5 million onrevenue of $480.9 million for the fiscal first quarter, which endedDec. 26. That was up from $20.9 million in profit and $422.7million in revenue during a year earlier.   Stevens said the securities portion of the management group'soffer would include $10 in market value of junior subordinateddebentures and $5 market value of preferred stock paying a dividendin cash or additional shares.</TEXT></DOC>
