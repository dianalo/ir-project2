But at home, the reaction ranges from indifference tocriticism.   Teacher strikes in black schools, the African National Congress'rivalry with other black groups, and even the troubled marriage ofa black pop singer have all been judged more interesting by theeditors of the Sowetan, the largest black daily newspaper.   The Sowetan _ based in the Soweto township where Mandela lives _generally gives close coverage to his activities. But it has notpublished a front-page story or picture of his trip since he leftSouth Africa on June 4.   Mandela begins an eight-city U.S. visit on Wednesday, when hewill arrive in New York.   Mandela's repeated calls for continued economic sanctionsagainst South Africa have drawn criticism from another leadingblack newspaper, one that traditionally backs the ANC.   ``Sanctions cannot be prolonged any longer,'' City Press said inan editorial Sunday. ``We do not want to inherit a wasteland.''   The newspaper, South Africa's largest black weekly, argued thatit might be time for a policy reassessment by the ANC: ``In thelight of the government's reform policy, has the time not come forthe ANC to review the use of sanctions as a strategy to endapartheid?''   Mandela, released Feb. 11 after more than 27 years in prison,has received almost daily coverage in white-oriented newspapers andgovernment-run television.   Most of the reports have focused on the sanctions issue and whatthe publications perceive as uncritical adulation of the ANC leader.   ``We do not begrudge the Americans their right to fete him,''said The Citizen, a pro-government daily. ``But we do feel theyshould welcome Mr. Mandela, the man, rather than Mr. Mandela, thelegend, the god, the new Christ...''   Many South Africans _ both black and white _ believe thecountry's political and racial conflicts are largely internalmatters that will be decided by South Africans rather thanoutsiders.   That may be the reason that reports about foreigners' responseto Mandela's message has drawn little interest in the country.   During Mandela's absence from South Africa, however, hisorganization appears to have put some major decisions on hold.   Mid-level government officials and ANC members last monthproduced a joint plan designed to clear the way for black-whitenegotiations on a new constitution and ending apartheid.   De Klerk said the government has accepted the plan and is readyto implement it. The ANC has asked to wait until July 10 beforeresponding. Mandela is due back in late July.   De Klerk lifted the state of emergency in most of the countryJune 8.   ``We are on the threshold of the real negotiation process ...the ANC must now stop vacillating,'' he said then.</TEXT></DOC>
