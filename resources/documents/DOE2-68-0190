This is, the total cogenerationrevenue is greater than the cogeneration system's operating cost plusthe cost of supplemental fuel and power. Whether it is sited at an existingfacility or new construction, cogeneration systems do require an incrementalinvestment over and above that which would be required if the end userwere to utilize more conventional utility services. While the decisionas to whether or not one should invest in cogeneration may consider such&quot;intangibles&quot; as predictability of future utility costs, reliabilityof electrical supply and the quality of that supply, the decision ultimatelybecomes one of basic economics. The owner frequently must quantify theseintangibles to determine whether the added investment is justified. Inperforming such analyses, a reduction in the end user utility costs istreated as a revenue.</TEXT></DOC>
