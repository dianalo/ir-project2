The drop followeda nearly two-point fall on Friday, which analysts blamed onweak grain prices.   Analysts said lower precious metals prices weakened theindex yesterday.

April platinum fell below the important$400-an-ounce support level to end at $396.80, down $9.60.May silver finished 15 cents an ounce lower at $3.975, belowits recent support level of $4.</LP><TEXT>   The CRB Index hit its four-year low of 209.72 on Feb. 22,then soared past 220 in the following weeks on expectationsof an economic recovery as well as other factors affectingindividual commodities. But the index failed to rise abovethe critical area of technical resistance.   &quot;It looks like the market has failed the test of 223,&quot;said John J. Murphy, president of JJM Technical Advisors Inc.of Oradell, N.Y. The next important level to watch is 216, headded, which will indicate whether the recent decline is aserious breakdown or a temporary pullback.   James M. Nevler, a financial analyst at the CommodityResearch Bureau, was skeptical of the recent rise becausethere wasn't the underlying demand for physical product tojustify the increase. The index is now declining, he said,because &quot;the economy {isn't} really generating the kind ofunderlying demand that would send our index higher and keepit there.&quot;   The strong dollar also is affecting the index, analystssaid. As inflation hedges, precious metals are hurt by astrong dollar, which tends to be viewed as anti-inflationary,said Mr. Murphy. In addition, a rising dollar hurts exportmarkets for commodities such as grains, he added, because itmakes them more expensive to foreign buyers.   Most of the world pays for commodities with dollars, so ifthe dollar is extremely strong the price to a foreign buyeris higher, Mr. Nevler said. That may be a factor holding theindex down, even if it isn't sending it down by itself, hesaid.   For a while, commodities rallied even while the dollar wasrising, said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst at PaineWebber,because foreigners were rushing to lock in prices ofcommodities they needed over the short-term. As the dollarextended its rally, however, foreign buyers began backingaway from the market, he said. They refrained from buying tobuild inventories because they don't think the dollar's rallywill hold over the long-term, which would mean prices willeventually come back down, he said.   Grain markets are very export-sensitive, Mr. Savaikoadded, and the rising dollar may have been one reason --along with weather and other factors -- that grains ran intotrouble late last week, he said. As grain prices retreated,they dragged the CRB index down with them, he said.   And, a strong dollar could hurt export business ingeneral, Mr. Savaiko said, which could impede a postwareconomic recovery.   The CRB index's decline is suggesting the economy isn'tactually rebounding yet, Mr. Savaiko said.   &quot;It would appear the rally is over unless the Fed becomesconcerned about the economy and dramatically eases to bringinterest rates down,&quot; he said. A revitalized economy wouldincrease demand for raw materials and down the road spurinterest in precious metals as a hedge against inflation, hesaid.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices settled lower in lighttrading on the New York Mercantile Exchange after alackluster day that saw little movement of prices in eitherdirection. There was little news to affect crude prices.However, an announcement that the North Sea Brent oilfield,despite a shutdown in April for maintenance, would still beable to provide 600,000 barrels of oil through inventoriesduring that period was a factor in the market. The newscaught traders slightly off-guard. They had anticipated thatproduction would stop totally. They sold oil contracts as aresult and a downward price trend was set for the day.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of cattle futures contractsare expected to sink at the open of trading today in the wakeof a government report that found a larger-than-expectednumber of cattle being fattened for slaughter. After theclose of trading yesterday, the Agriculture Departmentreported that the number of cattle on feedlots in seven majorranch states on March 1 was 8% higher than a year ago. Mostanalysts had expected the government to report a 6.7%increase. The government also reported that alarger-than-expected number of young cattle in February wereplaced onto feedlots, where they are fattened for slaughter.Although the report is expected to depress prices today,traders for the past four months have managed to shrug offsimilar reports of large increases in the feedlot population,said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St.Louis. &quot;It's bearish. But it's hard to tell how long itsinfluence will be.&quot; Cattle futures prices dropped slightly intrading before the report was released. Prices of hog futurescontracts sank amid continuing signs of weakening demand fromsupermarkets and restaurant chains. According to Alan Tank,an analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc., Des Moines, Iowa, therecent rally in pork and beef prices is prompting manyretailers to shift more of their meat purchases to poultry.Mr. Tank said he expects hog futures prices to trade in achoppy range until the Agriculture Department releases a pigcrop report March 28.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices rose. The May contract ended 1.65cents a pound higher at 94.40 cents. Talk of a warehouserobbery in Laredo, Texas, of 70,000 to 120,000 bags of coffeehelped support prices, analysts said. The robbery couldn't beconfirmed. Traders are concerned the trading house that ownedthe coffee will have to replace the stolen bags by buying inthe market, said Celeste Georgakis, a senior analyst atCargill Investor Services, adding that details of the robberyare unclear. In any case, most of what was going on in themarket yesterday was technical in nature, she said. Themarket has found support at 91 cents to 92 cents, she said,and the next area of resistance is 95 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
