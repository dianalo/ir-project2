Philips agreed for the first time to supply the Soviet Union with technology.    Under a five-year contract valued at 26 million guilders ($727,000), the big Dutch electronics group will provide the Soviets with technology for the manufacture of semiconductors.    The equipment covered by the contract is for use in making consumer-electronics products, especially color televisions. A Philips spokesman said the company believes the contract won't violate rules of the multinational Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, which regulates technology transfers to Communist countries.    The transaction still must be cleared by Dutch authorities, but the Philips spokesman said, &quot;We are very confident the contract will be approved.&quot; The Dutch government has been eager to expand exports to Eastern-bloc countries, with growth in the Netherlands' small domestic market limited and exports to Western European trading partners hurt by the guilder's strength.    Up to now, Philips has exported only small volumes of finished goods and industrial and scientific parts, as well as medical systems, to the Soviets. But the company expects to complete a wide range of other trade agreements in the future. The company also has been discussing the possibility of joint ventures with the Soviets &quot;for quite some time,&quot; the Philips spokesman said, but he added that a closer relationship would have to develop before such ventures would be possible. </TEXT></DOC>
