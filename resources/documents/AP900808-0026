But the refugees appear to be finding some solace in thegenerosity shown by leaders of neighboring Persian Gulf states.   One refugee, 7-year-old Fahd, said Iraqi soldiers had forcedtheir way into his family's Kuwait city home and made them turnover everything they owned.   Ghanem al-Asimi, who worked at Kuwait International Airport,described how Iraqi troops were ``beating up people, stealing carsand forcing drivers to stop, shooting them if they disobeyed.''   Asimi and others Kuwaitis spoke Tuesday in the cafeteria of ahotel in Bahrain, to which they had fled after Thursday's invasion.   ``Everybody was hysterical,'' he said. ``We kept getting callsfrom friends saying that a few families who tried to stop Iraqisfrom entering their homes were shot dead.''   The bulk of refugees who made it out were those who fled southon the first and second days of the invasion, before the Iraqisstretched their forces along the borders. More recent arrivalsslipped through the desert.   In Dubai, the capital of the neighboring United Arab Emirates, anumber of Europeans said Tuesday that they had sneaked across theKuwaiti desert to safety, pushed by a general desperation and afear of food shortages in Kuwait.   Jeremy Upton, a 28-year-old Briton, said Iraqi artillery hittingtargets in Kuwait city persuaded him he ``had to go for it fast.   ``I was looking north to the city, and about 15 miles away sawthe shells hitting,'' he said. ``It was probably the palace andthat really brought it home.''   Upton, a shipping company employee, grabbed his 2-year-olddaughter, Hannah, and his Kuwaiti wife, Ashmahan al-Abdul Hadi andfled.   Leaving behind all personal belongings, they jumped into a smalljeep and drove 840 miles to Saudi Arabia and on to Dubai on thesouthern Persian Gulf.   Helena Von Schantz, a 31-year-old Stockholm native, and herelectronics engineer husband Mikael Wiberg fled by car with theirdaughter and son and a German technician.   They left Kuwait shortly after sunrise Sunday, driving toBahrain from Abu Halifa, a southern suburb of Kuwait City.   ``It was safer to risk our lives this way than remain behind,''said Mrs. Von Schantz said. ``Food supplies were beginning to runout in Kuwait.''   ``The soldiers in our area seemed almost apologetic anduncomfortable about having invaded Kuwait. But soldiers near theborder were different, exuding a feeling of power,'' she said.   The Kuwaitis and other nationals who escaped their occupiedoil-rich kingdom have been greeted warmly bytheir southernneighbors.   In the United Arab Emirates, the government is paying the hotelbill of 800 Kuwaitis who arrived there. Each was given more than$500 on arrival.   Kuwait had a population of some 1.8 million, of which more than60 percent were foreigners. When the invasion was launched, abouthalf the population was reportedly out of the country, escaping thegulf's burning summer.   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has issued orders to consider allKuwaitis guests of the kingdom, according to official sourcesreached by telephone from Bahrain. Saudi banks were ordered Tuesdayto purchase Kuwaiti dinars from cash-starved Kuwaitis at a higherrate than the plummeting market value after the Iraqi invasion.   In addition, Kuwait Airways has started operating out of theeastern Saudi city of Dhahran.   The sources estimated the number of refugees from Kuwait nowinside the kingdom at about 40,000. They include the emir, SheikJaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who was spirited to Saudi Arabia in thefirst hours of the invasion.   The emir has apparently taken up residence in an opulent palace.</TEXT></DOC>
