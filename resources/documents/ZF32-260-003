(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mainframe Connection In today's world, the standard approach to heterogeneousdatabase access is a vendor-supplied gateway.andP;  In addition, the gatewayalmost always requires the use of some version (i.e., common subset) of SWLto communicate between the &quot;native&quot; and the &quot;foreign&quot; database managementsystem (DBMS).andP;  Therefore, if you want to communicate between your relationalDBMS (RDBMS) and another data source, the bottom line is the following.andP;  Rule#1: If the vendor doesn't provide the gateway, you're dead.andP;  Rule #2: If thedata source you wish to access isn't SQL based, you're also dead--unless, ofcourse, the vendor has provided the gateway (see Rule #1).andP;  Examples here areexisting gateways to IBM's IMS (from Ingres) and to Digital's RMS (fromIngres and Progress).andP;  Neither IMS nor RMS understands SOL, and both requirethe translation of incoming SQL via the gateway.andM;Enter Sybase with a different approach to gateways, one that looks at theproblem from the broader perspective of supporting an entire businesstransaction.andP;  Sybase views the distributed computing environment as a set ofautonomous services that need a mechanism with which to communicate amongthemselves.andP;  To Sybase, vendor-supplied, SQL-based gateways usually solvejust part of the overal problem for the customer, focusing on databasetransactions only and requiring agreement on a common subset of SQL.andP;  Thesetypes of gateways cannot provide adequate access to the myriad non-database,non-SQL types of information present in most large computing environments.andO;In these cases, SQL simply cannot serve as a common method of communication.andM;Last fall, Sybase introduced its Open Server/Open Client APIs that allow thecustomer to integrate virtually any fron end or back end into the Sybasenetwork.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  11, News and Analysis Department.)andP;  Thecompetition emphasizes, naturally, the fact that using the Open Server/OpenClient APIs requires the customer/developer to write code to accomplish theintegration.andP;  Wouldn't it be better if the nice RDBMS vendor did all thatwork for you?andP;  Sure, depending on whether the vendor would agree to do it,how much it would cost, when it would get done, and what functionality wouldbe provided.andP;  In terms of non-SQL-based gateways, none of the RDBMS vendorswill touch one unless the market volume and interest is there (e.g., IMS,RMS).andM;Sybase is now building its own gateway products using the Open Serverarchitecture.andP;  Recently, the company announced three products that provide aplatform for integrating IBM MVS mainframes into the Sybase client/serverenvirnment.andP;  With these products--the Net-Gateway, the Open Server forCustomer Information Control System (CICS), and the Open Gateway to DB2--thecustomer can access any MVS data, applications, and services.andP;  Sybase is notjust offering a gateway for DB2, as the traditional approach would dictate,but access to all IBM MVS mainframe data and services using a single set ofAPIs.andP;  (See Illustration 1.)andP;  This first set of products is limited to accessthrough the CICS transaction monitor, but Sybase plans to provide OpenServers for other environments in the future, such as IMS/DC on the IBMmainframe.andP;  The big benefit for Sybase is that the company now has a coherentintegration solution for customers with IBM MVS mainframes.andP;  This is a keyrequirement to meeting the needs of Fortune 1000 companies.andM;NETWORK GATEWAY.andP;  Net-Gateway provides the connection and protocol conversionbetween the LAN (client/server network) and the IBM SNA/LU6.2 network.andP;  Tothe client, the Net-Gateway looks as if it were a Sybase SQL Server.andP;  It mapsdatabase remote procedure calls (RPCs) issued by the client (which can beanother SQL server or Open Server as well as any Open Client) to CICStransactions; the routing of the request is transparent to the client.andP;  Theclient can attach to multiple mainframes, multiple CICS regions within asingle mainframe, and to multiple transactions within a CICS region.andM;Sybase has paid a great deal of attention to security and controlrequirements, which are particularly important in the mainframe environment.andO;Net-Gateway includes the ability to define transaction permissions to limitusers to a list of specified transactions, and connection permissions forlimiting users to specified regions or subsystems within the mainframe.andO;Net-Gateway also interfaces to mainframe security packages, such as RACF andTop Secret.andP;  The Net-Gateway can reject a request that doesn't meet securityrequirements before it even gets to the mainframe.andM;Another critical area is system administration.andP;  Net-Gateway provides on-linemonitoring and restart capability, an accounting log to track usage (e.g.,andO;for charge-back purposes), a data trace and error log, a timeout feature, anddiagnostics for problem detection and debugging.andM;Net-Gateway currently runs on an IBM RT and will be ported to the RS/6000workstation in the future.andP;  Another potential platform for Net-Gateway isOS/2 (although Sybase must first port the Open Server to OS/2).andP;  Sybase plansto port Net-Gateway to enough platforms to support at least DECnet, TCP/IP,and PC LAN connections to the mainframe.andM;OPEN SERVER FOR CICS.andP;  The Sybase Open Server for CICS is a set of systemservices for CICS transactions.andP;  Through CICS transactions, the client canaccess any data on MVS, including VSAM, DL/1, sequential files, static anddynamic SQL access to DB2, and other DBMS data.andP;  The client can also accessMVS applications and host services such as Job Entry Subsystems (JES), CICSqueues, Intelligent Synchronous Communication (ISC) and Multi-RegionOperation (MRO).andM;A major benefit of the Open Server approach is the option to use the sametools for accessing data sources that are used currently.andP;  Thus, givingadditional clients access to mainframe data and services doesn't have toinvolve developing new paths to the data, with the concurrent headaches ofmaintaining control and security.andP;  The Open Server to CICS can be merelyanother way to access the current paths to data.andM;OPEN GATEWAY FOR DB2.andP;  The Sybase Open Gateway for DB2 provides access to DB2plus all of the functionality of the Open Server for CICS.andP;  The DB2 gatewaysupports read and write access to DB2 data via dynamic SQL.andP;  It also providesautomatic error-mapping and data type conversion (ASCII/EBCDIC conversion isdone on the Net-Gateway).andM;The Open Server for CICS component of the Open Gateway for DB2 can be used toaccess DB2 using static rather than dynamic SQL.andP;  This is very important inproduction environments, since static SQL is pre-parsed, pre-optimized, andprecompiled.andP;  Static SQL offers significant performance enhancements overdynamic SQL, which is the only option provided by competing DB2 gateways.andO;Unlike using dynamic SQL through the DB2 gateway, using static SQL though theOpen Server for CICS does require development on the part of the customer.andM;Sybase describes its gateway to DB2 as providing &quot;turnkey&quot; access to DB2.andP;  Itis important to understand what this means: While the gateway providesautomatic protocol, data type, and error code translation, the client mustsend DB2 SQL language through the gateway.andP;  The user cannot run a Sybaseapplication against DB2 as if it were a Sybase SQL server, unless, of course,the application is restricted only to those Sybase SQL statements that arecompletely DB2 compliant.andP;  The benefit is the ability to use all of DB2'sconsiderable functionality with no restrictions.andP;  The downside is the need toknow DB2 SQL.andP;  For a customer who wants a common subset of SQL forheterogeneous communication, this will obviously not be the answer.andP;  However,it is also important to realize that the client does not have to be a Sybaseclient; it can be any front end that uses the Sybase Open Client APIs.andP;  Sousing Sybase SQL, or a common subset, may be irrelevant.andP;  Another point isthat client is not necessarily synonymous with end user.andP;  A developer can puttogether a client application that accesses DB2, and the end user may neverhave to know any SQL at all, nor that the data comes from DB2.andM;Sybase does not translate Sybase SQL to DB2 SQL for two primary reasons.andP;  Thefirst is performance.andP;  Every translation step in the process takes time.andP;  Thesecond reason is functionality.andP;  Sybase does not believe the customer shouldbe forced to use a common subset of commands to access data.andP;  This is thebasic philosophical difference between Sybase and its competition: ease ofuse and development through commonality versus flexibility and functionality.andO;Sybase will maintain that its approach is the correct one and that there area lot of customers out there who agree.andP;  And we don't doubt that someenterprising software developer will fill in the gap with the necessarylanguage translation as an add-on product to the Sybase gateway.andM;AVAILABILITY.andP;  The Sybase IBM MVS connectivity products are all availablenow.andP;  Open Server for CICS is priced from $75,000 to $155,000.andP;  Open Gatewayfor DB2 (which includes Open Server for CICS) ranges in cost from $100,000 to$210,000.andP;  The Net-Gateway costs from $1,260 to $64,800.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
