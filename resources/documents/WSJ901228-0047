Environmentalists, who have criticized the new federalemissions rules as too weak, hailed Massachusetts' move asthe beginning of a trend that eventually may force the autoindustry to meet the California standards nationwide. &quot;Wehope to create a domino effect,&quot; said Jenny Carter, anattorney with the Massachusetts Public Interest ResearchGroup, an offshoot of Ralph Nader's lobbying organizations.</LP><TEXT>   The Massachusetts law, to be phased in from 1995 to 2003,requires auto makers to cut new vehicles' hydrocarbonemissions to levels 75% lower than those set by the newfederal law. It requires emission levels of other major smogingredients, nitrogen oxides, to be 50% lower than requiredunder the new federal standards. The Massachusetts law alsocopies California's provisions that require auto makers tocontinually test air-pollution control systems in randomlyselected vehicles they've previously sold and to correctfailures.   Massachusetts' adoption of the California standards&quot;increases the momentum dramatically&quot; among Northeast statesto adopt similar rules, said Michael Bradley, executivedirector of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air UseManagement, or NESCAUM, an eight-state group that coordinatesregional efforts to cut air pollution. He added that Maineand Rhode Island &quot;are close to proposing similarregulations.&quot; Illinois, Texas, Maryland, Pennsylvania,Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington and Oregon also &quot;haveexpressed interest in&quot; the California standards, he said.   &quot;At some point, it will simply be easier for carmanufacturers to make the better car for all 50 states,&quot; saidMassachusetts state Rep. David Cohen, co-sponsor of the newlaw.   The auto industry lobbied hard against the Massachusetts'law, arguing that it will increase car sticker prices by $500or more. &quot;There's no free lunch,&quot; said Thomas Joyce, a Bostonattorney representing the Motor Vehicle ManufacturersAssociation.   But supporters of the new law estimate the improvedpollution-control devices it requires will add only $100 to$300 to a new car's price. &quot;Given the industry's unfulfilleddoomsday predictions about earlier emissions standards, itscredibility is sorely lacking&quot; in predictions of fallout fromthe new standards, said Mr. Cohen.   Supporters of the Massachusetts law asserted that itrepresents the cheapest way to meet air-pollution standardsmandated by the new federal law. To attain the pollution cutsexpected under the auto-emission standards by loweringsmokestack emissions instead is estimated to cost as much asfive times what the auto standards will cost, said NESCAUM'sMr. Bradley.</TEXT></DOC>
