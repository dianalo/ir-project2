Particularattention is given to those processes which are important for an understandingof the energetics of a flare. The observations are put in the contextof outstanding questions relevant to the development of solar flare models.Eight specific measurements are selected which the author believes aregenerally applicable to large flares and which provide critical constraintson the boundary conditions for models.</TEXT></DOC>
