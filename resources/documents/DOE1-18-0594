The article explains aboutFluoro Tetra Silicic Mica (TSM) which was used as the catalyst carrier.(2) Composition of ester by reaction of olefin and methylformate. (3)Composition of {alpha} and {beta}unsaturated compound with methanol asvinylation agent. (4) Composition of diphenoquinone by oxidation couplingof phenol. Concerning the above studies, they progressed in successionas the study No. 2 was pursued based upon the data obtained during thestudy No. 1. (4 figs, 3 tabs, 22 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
