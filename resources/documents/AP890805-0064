The increased security comes amid a clamor by politicians andthe press over what they say is unfair treatment by the Westernnews media.   ``It's War Against Slanted Reports,'' said a headline inSaturday's Kenya Times, a Nairobi newspaper owned by the country'sonly legal political party.   The accompanying story reported the outraged comments of morethan half a dozen party leaders decrying news coverage of themurder of Marie Ferraro, 50, of Bethany, Conn.   Typical was that of Joseph Kamotho, secretary-general of thegoverning Kenya African National Union, who said reports of theslaying were overblown and intended to scare off tourists.   More than 700,000 visitors brought nearly $350 million intoKenya's economy last year, making tourism the country's biggestsingle source of hard currency.   In an editorial Friday, the independent Daily Nation said theAmerican press had painted ``Kenya as a benighted country ofbloodthirsty and crime-prone people.   ``Let us face it,'' the editorial continued, ``there is morecrime in that metropolis called New York than there is in'' all ofKenya, a country the size of Texas with a population of 22 million.   A gang of armed men attacked Ms. Ferraro's tour group July 28 ona dirt road between Tsavo and Amboseli national parks insouthwestern Kenya.   The killers, believed to have been poachers, have not beencaptured.   It was the latest in a series of attacks on tourists in Kenya'snational parks that began last September. Gunmen have killed threevisitors and seriously wounded three.   Nonetheless, in ordering increased ground and aerialsurveillance of the parks, Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzocalled Ms. Ferraro's slaying ``an isolated incident.''   He said police, in consultation with tour operators, willprovide armed escorts for tour groups in some of the country'slargest and most popular parks.   Tsavo, divided by Kenya's main highway into two reserves,contains more than 8,000 square miles of land, much of it remoteand nearly inaccessible.   The attacks on tourists have coincided with a crackdown on ivorypoachers, who have reduced Kenya's elephant population from 65,000in the 1970s to about 17,000 today.   Some observers have speculated that the poachers now have turnedto robbing tourists.</TEXT></DOC>
