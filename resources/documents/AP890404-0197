Comfort and prestige on aluxurious scale probably count as much, judging from a CensusBureau report.   Data from the report show that much of the new-home constructionmarket has gone upscale to a surprising extent at the very time,oddly, that pressure is growing for more affordable housing foryoung families.   The situation poses a dilemma for housing markets: How canexisting owners continue to move up to more expensive housing iffirst-time buyers cannot afford to buy the houses the more affluentowners are leaving?   Most of the demand for luxurious accommodations comes fromexisting owners who, benefiting from rising market values in thepast few years, have amassed mountains of equity that can beapplied to fulfilling their housing dreams.   Eventually, some housing people predict, the trend to moreexpensive housing could automatically abort because of weakness inthe lower end of the market, leaving a dearth of the move-up buyerswith sufficient equity.   The Census Bureau report shows that in 1988 the median size ofnew homes was 1,815 square feet, compared with 1,605 square feet in1984.   More revealing are the amenities: 42 percent with more than twobaths, compared with just 28 percent in 1984; 26 percent with fourbedrooms or more versus 18 percent in 1984; and 75 percent withcentral air, versus 71 percent.   The proportion with more than one fireplace also rose, to 65percent from 59 percent, as did the proportion with garages able toaccommodate more than two cars, 65 percent against 55 percent.   A separate survey of homeowner preferences by the NationalAssociation of Home Builders confirms that consumers seekinganother home look for more room and more amenities, and that theywon't accept stripped-down houses.   At one time, basic houses were viewed by government and industryofficials as a practical means of providing shelter at relativelylow prices, while providing the owner the option of adding spacewhen finances permitted.   Analyzing the figures, a Home Builder economist attributes atleast part of the luxury phenomenon to demographics, especially anaging of the population, and income trends, or ``a greaterinequality in the distribution of income.''   A more economical approach to housing, and perhaps more inbalance with an aging population, could be detected in figures formultifamily housing, which includes many rental units.   Those figures, from the same Census Bureau report, show themedian size of new units in 1988 was 935 square feet compared with871 square feet in 1984. Units with two baths or more rose to 41percent from 35 percent.   However, economic or demographic pressure was revealed in someof the other multifamily figures:   The percentage with two bedrooms rose only 1 percentage point,from 54 to 55, between 1984 and 1988. Units with three or morebedrooms dropped to 8 percent from 9 percent.   Moreover, the percentage of units constructed with airconditioning fell to 84 percent from 89 percent.   While these multifamily figures do suggest some leveling in thedemand for luxuries, they also remain extraordinarily high whenmatched against some of the data from another Census Bureau study,this one in 1940.   In that census, the median value of owner-occupied homes was$2,938. Thirty-one percent of existing homes had no running water,45 percent lacked complete private plumbing, and fewer than halfhad central heat.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday, April 5.</NOTE></DOC>
