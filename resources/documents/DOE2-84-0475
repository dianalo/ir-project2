The main risk in normal operation is occupational exposureclose to the radioactive products accumulation points. The accidentalrisks are mainly related to an outage of the off-gas cleaning or a tightnessfailure with radioactive products dissemination resulting from eitherinternal perturbation (filter tear, exhauster failure, ...) or externalincident (electricity cut-off, furnace disarrangements, fire or explosioninside the incinerator). In view of these risks, it is interesting toexamine the safety and protection functions of different components ofoff-gas treatment systems.</TEXT></DOC>
