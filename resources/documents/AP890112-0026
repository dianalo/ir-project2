This year, taxpayers may be asked topick up the cost of rescuing the industry _ and the price could runinto the billions of dollars.   Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about theproblem.   Q: How are depositors' savings protected?   A: The first line of defense when an institution fails is agovernment insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp. (the FSLIC).   The ultimate backing, if the fund runs out of money, is thetaxpayer. On several occasions Congress, most recently in 1987, hasreaffirmed that the full faith and credit of the federal governmentstands behind the deposits.   Q: Does that mean the government would pay the depositors if theSandamp;L went out of business?   A: Yes, as long as the Sandamp;L has federal insurance.   In most cases the insurance fund tries to avoid direct depositorpayoffs. Instead, the government ``rescues'' the institution byproviding new owners with a mixture of cash, promissory notes andother guarantees to wipe out the old losses.   The new owners also invest some of their own money and theinstitution stays open, usually under a new name. The old managerslose their jobs, the stockholders lose their investment butdepositors are protected.   Q: How does the FSLIC work?   A: The FSLIC guarantees deposit accounts up to $100,000 in nearly3,000 Sandamp;Ls. (Similarly, government insurance also protects savers incommercial banks through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC),while the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) stands behindcredit unions.)   Q: Where do the insurance funds get their money?   A: From the institutions whose deposits they insure. Sandamp;Ls, forinstance, pay a premium of 21 cents a year for every $100 indeposits. The FSLIC also has been raising money by selling 30-yearbonds, which will be paid off by the premiums from the industry.And, it sells property from failed institutions to recover some ofits costs.   Q: If Sandamp;Ls fund the insurance plan, why do people say the publicwill end up paying?   A: The Reagan administration has recently acknowledged thatincome from the industry won't be enough to cover savings accountsin failed Sandamp;Ls and, therefore, the public will have to bear much ofthe cost. Industry trade groups say healthy institutions will startgoing under if they're forced to pay higher premiums.   Q: How would the public pay?   A: This is not clear. The Treasury Department is working on aplan for President-elect Bush. Private analysts believe that in somemanner tax money will be needed.   The solution could involve a direct appropriation of taxpayerfunds. Or, Congress could authorize regulators to borrow what theyneed with the understanding that taxpayer funds will be used to paythe interest. Or, Congress could impose fees on members of thepublic, such as home buyers, who benefit from the Sandamp;L system.   Q: What is the controversy about the 1988 bailouts?   Keeping a money-losing institution alive means it could continueto lose money under new owners, eventually making another rescuenecessary.   The government protects the new owners from losing money on loansmade by the previous owners. Critics think the new owners ought toshare more of the risk as an incentive to manage the loan portfoliowisely.   Also, members of Congress are angry because in some cases privatebuyers are reaping tax breaks from the deals that are worth morethan they are paying to take possession of failed institutions. Theysay regulators ought to have been able to get more cash from thebuyers in exchange for the tax benefits.   Q: Why do regulators think the bailout approach will ultimatelysave money for the taxpayers?   A: If the government simply shuts down an institution, it has tospend enormous amounts immediately to pay off depositors _ moremoney than the regulators have. Over a period of years, it thenhopes to get back some of it by selling loans and repossessedproperty from the failed Sandamp;L.   By rescuing an institution, the government pays only for theloss, not for the entire amount of insured deposits. And, it gets tospread out the cost, typically for as long as 10 years.   Also, most institutions have a certain value as a going concern _such as a loyal customer base _ that would be destroyed if they wereliquidated. In 1988, new Sandamp;L owners pumped $3 billion into therescued institutions in exchange for this value.   In December, regulators ``resolved'' the cases of 75 Sandamp;Ls at anestimated cost of $15.5 billion to the insurance fund and $4 billionin tax breaks. The ultimate cost of liquidating those Sandamp;Ls wouldhave been $22.8 billion, however, and the insurance fund would havehad to immediately come up with $47 billion in ``up-front cash.''   Q: How did we get in this fix in the first place?   A: Inflation and high interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980sput most Sandamp;Ls in a bind. They were forced to pay more to attractdeposits than they were earning on long-term mortgages already ontheir books.   One of the ``solutions'' was to allow savings and loans to expandbeyond traditional mortgage lending and invest in commercial realestate and other projects, which earn higher rates of return andrequire only a short-term commitment by the Sandamp;L.   The new rules attracted a new class of Sandamp;L owner, now called``high-fliers.'' They were particularly prevalent in states withmore liberal Sandamp;L rules such as Texas, California and Florida.   Unfortunately, the new investments made by high-fliers wereriskier. When the Texas economy collapsed because of plummeting oilprices, borrowers stopped making payments and much of the commercialreal estate serving as collateral was worth only a fraction of itsprevious value.   At the same time Sandamp;Ls were entering unfamiliar territory, theReagan administration was cutting back on its force of examiners. Itwas only in 1985, when regulators arranged to have the examinationforce taken off budget, that Sandamp;Ls began to be more closelysupervised.   In some cases outright fraud contributed to the losses. A JusticeDepartment-led task force, operating in Texas since 1987, hasobtained indictments and convictions of Sandamp;L managers.   Also, throughout the 1980s, Congress, at the urging of industrylobby groups, consistently refused to provide regulators with enoughmoney to shut down all failed institutions. The institutions stayedopen and lost even more money. Congress also directed regulators to``forbear'' from taking action against Sandamp;Ls in economicallydistressed areas, such as Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
