Being 280 miles south of Yap, 500 miles north of the equator, 600 miles east of the Philippines, 2,500 miles south of Japan and 4,600 miles southwest of Hawaii, Palauans made do for 27 centuries without imports. Their 343 bejungled islands (totaling 192 square miles) and surrounding seas met all their needs.    When imports arrived, they proved costly. Spanish and German sailors brought diseases for which 18th century Palauans hadn't any immunity. In 1783, Palau's population was estimated at 40,000. A century later, it was only about 4,000.    Japanese colonialists, between 1914 and 1944, brought technology for concocting alcoholic beverages -- a continuing taste that is blamed for a bountiful crime rate and 2,700 traffic accidents yearly on just 16 miles of paved roads.    World War II brought a bloody battle to the island of Peleliu in September 1944. Some 11,000 Japanese, nearly 2,000 Americans and 526 Palauans died.    The U.S., under a United Nations mandate to administer the islands, brought the modern welfare state. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations plied the place with handouts of food and easy money that all but wiped out indigenous farming and fishing. Soon, nearly half the work force was on the government payroll and Palau was all but dependent on U.S. aid.    Advice was the next big import as Palau moved toward the independence the U.S. and U.N. promised. It came from Washington, Moscow, the West German &quot;Greens,&quot; American lawyers, Japanese investors, Peace Corps volunteers, environmentalists and even John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist. If anything, it left Palau deeply confused.    Today, the almost-Republic of Palau is broke, in debt, in a vexing legal bind, and surely the winner of any contest for political complications per capita. The population, estimated at between 13,500 and 15,500, mostly wants Uncle Sam's $1 billion. The government is already committed to spend a large chunk of it. But not enough Palauans are willing to pay the price.    The deal is this: Palau becomes a nation with its foreign affairs and defense looked after by the U.S. under a so-called compact of free association. The U.S. gets to build air and naval bases if it's kicked out of the Philippines within 50 years, though voters here could cancel the deal.    Palau would get $320 million in aid over the first 15 years, a $70 million investment fund it can't touch for 15 years, and other funds that add up to about $1 billion.    The catch is that in 1979, on the road to nationhood, Palau adopted a constitution that bans everything nuclear from Palau. The U.S. promises it won't use, test, store or dispose of nuclear weapons here. But it wants its nuclear-powered ships to be able to make port calls in Palau, and it refuses to say if U.S. ships or planes that come here will carry nuclear arms.    It takes a 75% vote to override Palau's constitution; voters have failed four times to do so. In 1983, 62% favored taking the money and waiving the nuclear provision. In 1984, the vote was 67% in favor. In February 1986, the favorable vote was 72.19% but slipped to 66% in December.    Anti-nuclear groups praise Palauans for standing up to a superpower. Environmentalists cheer because they don't want to see Palau's pristine islands and coral gardens disrupted by naval dredging, practice amphibious landings by Marines, or jungle-warfare training. In radio broadcasts and telexes, Moscow tells Palauans to hang on and promises aid if the pipeline from Washington is cut.    Some Palauans, including U.S.-educated young people and businessmen, argue that U.S. largess has ruined their culture and economy, and the best way to restore both is to derail the U.S. gravy train.    With U.S. grants and subsidies, Palauans are rich compared to their Asian neighbors. But about 20% of the work force is jobless while 1,000 imported Filipinos work as maids and in construction.    After the 72.19% vote last year, Palau and the U.S. decided that was good enough, and signed the compact. But the Palau courts ruled it unconstitutional.    Meanwhile, the 1985 murder of Palau's first president, Haruo I. Remeliik, continues to stir allegations of meddling by outside forces. Three Palauans were convicted in the killing, but other Palauans say the whole story hasn't come out.    The government has defaulted on a $34 million debt incurred in the construction of a 16-megawatt power plant. Banks won't lend it any more money and the U.S. refuses to bail it out.    The current president, Lazarus E. Salii, told the U.N. Trusteeship Council last month that Palau may be forced to align itself with a nation other than the U.S. if the June 23 vote fails to achieve the required 75% majority. Observers here said he was trying to scare Palauans into the prospect of an alliance with a potentially less-generous Japan.    Secretary of State George Shultz touched down here briefly last June to plug affiliation with the U.S. and to see again the place he helped liberate from the Japanese as a young Marine officer in 1944. Army and Marine units invaded the islands of Peleliu and Angaur. They now have a reputation for producing what is believed to be Palau's biggest cash export crop: marijuana. </TEXT></DOC>
