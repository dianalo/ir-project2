Gorbachev's offer to cut the Red Armyby 10 percent and withdraw 50,000 Soviet troops from Eastern Europehas not fully eased Western worries about a decisive Kremlin edge inmen, tanks and artillery.   Gorbachev's unilateral cuts and message of peace were likely tofurther enhance his soaring popularity in Western Europe, and torekindle calls in Congress and NATO member states for withdrawal ofsome of the 335,000 U.S. troops in Europe.   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other foreignministers of the Atlantic alliance quickly said Gorbachev'sstatements confirmed their view that the Soviets have enoughnon-nuclear armaments to mount a blitzkrieg offensive and tip thebalance in opening days of an East-West conflict.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in a statement issuedafter Gorbachev's U.N. speech on Wednesday, said ``the Soviet Unionitself possesses more tanks and artillery than all the other membersof the Warsaw Pact and the (NATO) Alliance combined. And they areconcentrated in a manner which raises grave concerns about thestrategy which they are intended to support.''   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said Gorbachev's move``seems to be a step in the right direction,'' but warned bigimbalances would remain.   Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez welcomedGorbachev's proposals, but said, ``The Soviets know that inconventional arms negotiations they have to reduce much more thanWestern allies.''   West German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz said Gorbachev mustfollow up with ``actual and verifiable withdrawal of troops andreduction of forces.''   NATO, which cannot afford to match the Soviets soldier forsoldier and tank for tank, has a policy of deterring a conventionalattack with the threat of nuclear weapons, an approach that wagshave summarized as ``fight like the devil for two weeks, then blowup the world.''   The NATO nuclear deterrent and the perceived will to use it hasfaded, however, with the signing last December of a U.S.-Soviettreaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons andcontinuing negotiations to sharply reduce long-range strategic arms.   The Soviets have been tinkering with their doctrine, as well,declaring that they will maintain forces adequate only to fend offan attack, not to launch one.   Gorbachev's announcement of troop cuts in Eastern Europe and anoverall reduction of 500,000 men in an armed forces totaling 5.6million soldiers are the first concrete examples of the new Kremlinpolicy, the doctrine of ``reasonable sufficiency.''   Gorbachev also said the Red Army would shed 10,000 tanks, butthose cuts are only small steps in bringing NATO and Warsaw Pactforces into balance, according to Western figures.   NATO says the Warsaw Pact has the following advantages:   _Ground forces in Europe: Warsaw Pact 3.1 million, NATO 2.2million.   _Tanks: Warsaw Pact, 51,500; NATO 16,424.   _Armored fighting vehicles: Warsaw Pact 22,400; NATO 4,135.   _Other armored vehicles: Warsaw Pact 71,000, NATO 35,351.   _Combat aircraft: Warsaw Pact 8,250, NATO 3,977.   _Helicopters: Warsaw Pact, 3,700, NATO 2,419.   _Artillery: Warsaw Pact 43,400, NATO 14,458.   _Anti-aircraft systems: Warsaw Pact 24,400, NATO 10,309.   _Armored vehicle launched bridges: Warsaw Pact, 2,550, NATO, 454.   NATO, in its statement, proposed a limit of 40,000 tanks foreither side, which Gorbachev's cuts would approach.   The Soviet Union, he said, would remove six tank divisions fromEastern Europe, out of a total of 15 tank divisions counted by theLondon-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.   Such a step could help ease NATO concerns about the offensivepotential of the Red Army.   But the Soviet president offered no specifics about easing theimbalance in other types of weapons. Moreover, pulling 50,000 Soviettroops out of Eastern Europe would not come close to balancingground forces.   According to the IISS annual report, the Soviet Union has 380,000troops stationed in East Germany, 65,000 in Hungary, 80,000 inCzechoslovakia and 40,000 in Poland.   Gorbachev said Red Army forces would be withdrawn from EastGermany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but he did not provide abreakdown.   So far, the Soviet Union has not disclosed its troop and armamentlevels, and those numbers will be at the center of debate when thetwo sides sit down to discuss conventional force cuts, a step thatU.S. officials say will probably come early next year.   Despite the continued imbalance, President Reagan,President-elect Bush and Shultz welcomed the Soviet step, which ispart of a wider opening of the Soviet Union toward the West.   Before even agreeing to resume conventional force negotiations,which had been under way for 15 years in a different format, theWest demanded improvement in Soviet human rights policies,improvements that have been reflected in greater numbers of Jews andArmenians allowed to emigrate, cessation of Soviet jamming ofWestern radio broadcasts and the release of many prisoners ofconscience from prisons and camps.</TEXT></DOC>
