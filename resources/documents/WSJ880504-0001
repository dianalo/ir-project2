The breakdown in negotiations means the U.S. will renew a request for an independent panel to hear the dispute under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based body regulating global trade. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the request would go before GATT this morning in Geneva.    Japan blocked the initial request to form such a panel in April, insisting that the issue be settled through bilateral discussions. U.S. trade officials had no assurance last night that Japan wouldn't block a new request, which it could do under a GATT tradition of decisions by consensus. If GATT does review the complaint, it could take up to six months to reach a decision.    The impasse on the beef and citrus question is a major setback for trade relations between the two countries. Previously, Japan and the U.S. have been able to finesse most disputes, including a disagreement over access to the Japanese public-works market for U.S. construction firms. Although the countries have turned to GATT on some issues, the beef and citrus question is by far the most serious.    The impasse indicates the inability of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to make concessions on agricultural issues in the face of opposition from politically powerful Japanese farmers.    The breakdown in talks could also discourage the U.S. from joining with Japan to pressure the European Community to give up its agricultural subsidies, which form one of the thorniest issues now confronting GATT.    U.S. officials have estimated that beef exports to Japan could double to $1.3 billion annually if quotas were eliminated.    Experts on both sides have said that there is little doubt GATT would rule Japan's beef quotas illegal. They also say such a decision would give Japan at most about three years to liberalize its policy.    The two countries have been in dispute over beef and citrus imports since a bilateral agreement covering the products expired March 31. The U.S. was willing to allow Japan up to three years to eliminate the quotas, but the sticking point was what was to follow. Mr. Yeutter implied in a statement last night that Japan continued to insist on imposing a surcharge on beef and citrus products after the termination of quotas.    &quot;Regrettably, the final Japanese proposal offered only a modest increase in access (to their markets), and it would have left in place provisions that the U.S. considers to be incompatible with GATT rules,&quot; Mr. Yeutter said in his statement.    A high-ranking Japanese delegation, including Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato and Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga, left the talks last night grim-faced and refused to talk to a crowd of reporters waiting at the office of the U.S. trade representative.    Mr. Sato had spent a week here talking repeatedly with Mr. Yeutter. As he entered his hotel shortly after the talks, he showed his disappointment to waiting Japanese reporters, waving his hand and saying &quot;it's all over.&quot;    Exporters in the U.S. are currently able to ship beef and citrus to Japan under temporary quotas set unilaterally by that country.    The U.S. had also sought to eliminate a Japanese practice of requiring imported orange juice to be mixed with juice made from domestically grown fruit. Mr. Yeutter says the practice is in violation of GATT rules.    U.S. negotiators were also apparently unsuccessful in persuading Japan to dismantle the Livestock Import Promotion Council, a quasi-governmental agency that sets beef prices and distributes the product in Japan. The U.S. has complained that the agency artificially inflates meat prices in Japan and hinders the growth of meat consumption.    Although Mr. Yeutter wouldn't reveal specific details of the final Japanese proposal, a member of his staff said the offer was the equivalent of allowing the U.S. to supply each Japanese consumer &quot;one Big Mac, one Quarter Pounder and two glasses of orange juice a year.&quot;    Representatives of U.S. farmers backed the Reagan administration's move to elevate the dispute to GATT. &quot;We're disappointed, but we support Mr. Yeutter's decision not to accept the Japanese offer,&quot; said Paul Drazek, assistant national affairs director of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He added that the Japanese plan to impose additional tariffs on these commodities after the scrapping of the quotas is &quot;totally unacceptable.&quot;    However, the National Cattlemen's Association was assured by Mr. Yeutter that he would continue to seek a bilateral solution even while GATT hears the U.S. complaint. &quot;Ambassador Yeutter says that door's always open,&quot; said Tom Cook, the association's industry affairs director. </TEXT></DOC>
