Dioxin is the chemical that contaminated Agent Orange, thejungle defoliant that American soldiers were exposed to inthe Vietnam War. Until its banning in 1984, tiny amounts ofdioxin, created during the manufacture of a basic chemicalknown as 2,4,5-TCP, also ended up in some weed killers andinsecticides and in the sterilizing solution,hexacholorphene.</LP><TEXT>   The new study found that cancer deaths among more than5,000 chemical plant workers exposed to dioxin were about 15%higher than expected. But the higher death rate wasconcentrated largely among workers whose jobs had exposedthem to dioxin for more than a year and who probably hadblood levels of dioxin as much as 500 times higher than seenin the general population, researchers said. Among theseworkers, the cancer death rate was 46% higher than expected.   The study, by the National Institute of OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) in Cincinnati, doesn't prove thatdioxin causes human cancer but is &quot;consistent with&quot; thatbelief, an institute epidemiological team headed by MarilynA. Fingerhut reports in this week's New England Journal ofMedicine.   &quot;The evidence is short of proof, as the authors explain,but it must be taken seriously as a flag of a probable humanrisk,&quot; declared an accompanying editorial by John C. BailarIII, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at McGillUniversity in Montreal.   &quot;Parties on both sides of the continuing debate about theregulation of dioxin exposure will no doubt cite this work insupport of their positions,&quot; Dr. Bailar wrote. &quot;Some cancerswere indeed more frequent in an exposed group than amongcontrols, but the differences were for the most part notstatistically significant,&quot; he explained.   Nevertheless, the epidemiologist added, the results &quot;do infact shift the burden of proof. There is some weakening ofthe position of those who believe that low levels of exposureto TCDD {dioxin} are entirely safe in humans.&quot;   A spokesman for one of the chemical makers involved,Monsanto Co. in St. Louis, said &quot;We agree with the editorial{by Dr. Bailar} that the study is equivocal andinconclusive.&quot; He called the new study &quot;encouraging&quot; in thatthe workers' overall death rate was about the same as in thegeneral population.   The spokesman added that the question of how much of arole cigarette smoking and exposures of the workers toasbestos and other chemicals played in the workers' cancerdeaths needs to be determined. &quot;We agree with the authorsthat further work needs to be done,&quot; he said.   Dioxin has been found to cause cancer when given tolaboratory animals in high dosages, but studies of humans,where exposures are extremely low, have been equivocal. Someof the human studies have found that some groups of cancerpatients had higher past exposures to dioxin-contaminatedchemicals than non-cancer patients of the same age, sex andbackground. But other similar studies have failed to find alink between cancer and dioxin exposure.   The new study is the result of an effort begun in 1978 byNIOSH to identify all the workers who might have been exposedto dioxin at 12 U.S. chemical plants.   At the end of 1987, the overall death rate among the 5,172male workers identified was about the same as in the generalpopulation. But 265 of the deaths, a bit more than a quarterof all deaths, were from cancer, a rate that was 15% higherthan expected among a group of males of comparable ages.   On the theory that it takes years for cancer to develop,the researchers checked a subgroup of men who had worked withdioxin-contaminated chemicals for a year or more to see whathad happened to them 20 years or longer after their firstexposure. Of 1,520 such workers, 114 had died of cancer,compared with 78 expected deaths. This indicated a 46% higherrisk of cancer for such workers.</TEXT></DOC>
