The rally has left some OPEC skeptics shaking their heads, warning that there is little basis for such optimism.    In Europe, North Sea Brent crude early yesterday traded 65 cents higher, at $16.25 a barrel. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate for May delivery gained $1.01 to close at $17.89, the highest finish since Dec. 11.    Late Saturday, the five members of OPEC's price-monitoring committee, meeting in Vienna, agreed to reconvene April 23 with non-OPEC exporters to haggle over world-wide production cutbacks. The session is to be followed by a meeting of all 13 OPEC ministers. Though many analysts and traders have little faith in OPEC's ability to cut production, the willingness of non-OPEC nations to participate in talks caught their eye.    &quot;I'm more optimistic than usual because the meeting was initiated by non-OPEC producers; it seems highly unlikely they would get together with OPEC if they didn't have something to offer,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    Still, Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said yesterday's price surge was &quot;very premature.&quot; Others described the trading with such words as &quot;hysterical.&quot;    Mr. Rothman said it is clear that the market may rally until the April 23 meeting.    &quot;If people assume this OPEC/non-OPEC cut materializes, West Texas Intermediate should gravitate toward $19 to $19.50, which represents its value if OPEC spot prices go back to the $18 level,&quot; the cartel's official benchmark, Mr. Rothman said. However, he warned there could be snags, such as &quot;one king's comment, or one minister saying we're not going to agree.&quot; In such a case, &quot;the downside is going to be enormous.&quot;    Consumers might feel the effect of these developments this summer, one energy analyst said. Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc., New York, said crude's advances yesterday and in the past month will probably add about a nickel to gasoline prices before July 4. &quot;It seems at this stage that for whatever reason oil has gotten back into the cycle where it'll be easier for it to move higher than lower,&quot; Mr. Beutel said.    Products prices on the Nymex also soared yesterday. Gasoline closed at 50.95 cents a gallon, up 2.18 cents, and heating oil at 48.75 cents a gallon, up 2.42 cents.    Some analysts who say the rally was overdone point out that many traders had &quot;shorted&quot; the market late last week, or sold contracts in anticipation that prices would fall. These traders were forced to buy yesterday to offset their positions, and the heavy buying probably made the market look more bullish than it really is.    &quot;It's hard to know how much of the public got suckered into this (OPEC) deal,&quot; said John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York. But he said not enough people realize that OPEC has lost so much power that its members are most concerned with protecting their own market share, not keeping prices higher. &quot;To me, it's still NO-PEC; that's what we've been calling them the last two months,&quot; he said.    Responding to yesterday's price surge, USX Corp.'s Marathon Petroleum unit and Du Pont Inc.'s Conoco unit each raised the price they'll pay for West Texas Intermediate by 50 cents a barrel, to $16.50 a barrel.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices plunged, though there were no fundamental developments. May delivery copper settled at $1.002 a pound, just above the low of the day, for a loss of 4.2 cents. Analysts noted that the decline took place despite a drop in warehoused stocks of copper in London and New York, normally a price-supporting factor. London Metal Exchange inventories fell a sizable 2,750 tons to 53,375 tons, while those of the Commodity Exchange were off 278 tons to 10,789 tons. Yesterday, the market opened about unchanged. Then, computer-based selling developed and found little buying interest, causing prices to skid, one analyst said. Arbitrage selling of futures in New York prompted by a stronger British pound was a factor, as it has been recently, &quot;but not enough to account for a drop of this magnitude,&quot; he said. Another analyst, Bette Raptapoulos, of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said selling was mostly technical. &quot;A firmer dollar was a factor as was a thin market, which helped accelerate the decline,&quot; she said. Some support momentarily developed in the May contract at $1.04 and $1.02 but the decline continued.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: As expected, the Agriculture Department reported after the close of trading yesterday that it trimmed its forecasts of the nation's wheat and soybean stockpiles by 50 million bushels and 25 million bushels, respectively. &quot;There were no real surprises,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. The department cited stronger-than-expected U.S. exports for cutting its forecast of the wheat stockpile May 31, the end of the crop year, to 1.231 billion bushels. The department revised its soybean stockpile forecast for the end of the crop year, Aug. 31, to 290 million bushels from its March forecast of 315 million bushels. One factor was the department's decision to cut its estimate of Brazil's soybean harvest, which is currently under way, to 18 million bushels from a March estimate of 18.5 million bushels. Brazil is a major competitor of U.S. soybean exporters. The department left unchanged its corn stockpile forecast of 4.123 billion bushels. Analysts said they don't expect traders to react strongly today to the government report. &quot;There might be some friendly bent&quot; to the report, said Jonathan Will, a grain analyst at Cargill Investor Services, Chicago. &quot;But things were pretty much as advertised.&quot;    PRECIOUS METALS: Some analysts were surprised that gold, silver and platinum prices didn't rise sharply in tandem with crude-oil prices. Soaring energy prices generally portend rising inflation and buoy precious metals. But rather than opening sharply higher, morning gold on New York's Commodity Exchange opened $2.60 lower because of the U.S. dollar's strength early yesterday. &quot;I was rubbing my eyes. I couldn't believe it,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, senior precious metals analyst at PaineWebber Inc. Gold eventually drew some strength from oil's rise, Mr. Savaiko added, closing $1.20 higher than Friday, at $452.80 an ounce. Silver closed 3.4 cents higher, at $6.444 an ounce, and platinum finished at $535.90 an ounce, up $1.90.    INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices finished lower. Early profit-taking helped set the pace for the day's decline. Bellwether Treasury bond futures for June settlement closed 11/16 lower at 90 5/16. Traders blamed much of the day's decline on the rally in crude oil prices. &quot;The bump up in oil certainly scares people,&quot; said Jeffrey Priest, a bond trader with Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co., New York. The slide in the dollar after its strength early in the day also hurt bond prices. Traders are fearful that continued declines might prompt the Federal Reserve Board to tighten short-term interest rates in an effort to shore up the currency. </TEXT></DOC>
