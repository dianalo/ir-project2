JacobsStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BCW LGLTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)AEROSPACE (ARO)MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN)PETROLEUM (PET) </IN><TEXT>   Becor Western Inc. said Davis Mining andamp; Manufacturing Inc. offered to buy Becor for an undisclosed price that doesn't appear to exceed $255 million, the amount previously bid by another company.    Under the proposal, Davis Mining would buy all of Becor, but Becor shareholders would be paid stock totaling 60% of the acquired company and Davis would hold the remaining 40%. Becor executives couldn't be reached yesterday evening for elaboration.    Also yesterday, Lynch Corp., a Fairfield, N.J.-based packaging and manufacturing concern, withdrew its $255 million offer for Becor. And Becor said it is in talks with still another suitor.    The announcements are the latest in a series of on-again, off-again bids for Becor, a South Milwaukee, Wis., company that makes aerospace, mining and offshore oil gear. In February, the company agreed to a $238.1 million leveraged buyout by a management-led group, but completion of the deal has been held up as a string of other concerns have bid for the company. With yesterday's announcements, though, Davis Mining has the only bid competing with the management group's proposal.    Becor said it is studying the Davis Mining bid. Under the proposal, Davis would pay $10.45 in cash and $3 in 12.5% debentures for each Becor share, in addition to 60% of the common stock of the surviving company. Becor's announcement said the Davis offer &quot;doesn't appear to be higher than the withdrawn bid of Lynch.&quot;    But William Roj, secretary for Davis Mining, said, &quot;We believe our offer will be worth more to shareholders than the Lynch offer.&quot;    Lynch said the company decided to withdraw its offer after talking to Becor representatives, who indicated that &quot;other bids may be coming in,&quot; according to Daniel E. Miller, Lynch's vice president and general counsel. However, Lynch isn't walking away entirely, Mr. Miller said. &quot;We're keeping a window open&quot; for possibly making another offer.    Lynch, which is controlled by its chairman, Mario Gabelli, a New York money manager and investor, holds a 12.4% stake in Becor.    Davis Mining, a Coeburn, Va., coal mining and explosives company, had earlier said it wanted to buy the Becor division that makes mining gear.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Becor closed yesterday at $15.125 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
