(Sasha Lewis, (408)982-7450); cisco Systems, Inc. (Jeff Paine, (415) 688-8291); CMC, a RockwellInternational Company (Daphne Page, (805) 561-3104); IN-NET Corporation (JohnMazzaferro, (800) 283-FDDI); Network Peripherals, Inc. (Tom Slykhouse, (408)954-8030); Proteon, Inc. (Maureen MacGregor, (508) 898-2800, ext.2439);Schneider andamp; Koch andamp; Co. Datensysteme GmbH (Agatha Feudl, 49-721-792-345);Synernetics, Inc. (Dave Manley, (508) 670-9009); and Timeplex, Inc., a Unisyscompany (Lynn Derfus, (201) 930-4641).andP;  Vendor products tested includedrouters, bridges, concentrators, and dual- and single-attachment stations.andM;The ANTC program is dedicated to certifying, for end-users of networkingproducts, that FDDI products from different vendors will successfully operatetogether on the same ring.andM;The ANTC program and facility are outgrowths of AMD's World Networkactivities:  AMD's World Network products include circuits and software formajor communications standards including Ethernet and 10BASE-T, FDDI, andISDN.andM;Information: Diane Palermo, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 901 Thompson Place,P.O.Box 3453, Sunnyvale, CA 94088-3000; (408) 982-7475.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
