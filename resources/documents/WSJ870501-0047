The indictments end a four-year investigation into U.S. Tax Planning Services Ltd., a Cayman Islands-based concern with about 13 offices in the United States.    A Justice Department spokesman said the 25-count indictment alleges that U.S. Tax Planning sold fraudulent charitable contributions to clients with college-age children, false insurance policies to doctors and fake commodities losses to wealthy clients.    For instance, the Justice Department said, one scheme called for customers to make a charitable contribution to set up a church parish. In return, the church would grant a scholarship representing 90% of the contribution to whomever the customer designated.    The spokesman said the IRS has identified more than 2,000 returns that may contain false tax deductions, ranging from $2,500 to $2.7 million, sold by U.S. Tax Planning.    Among those indicted were James G. Bryan of Portland, Ore., founder of the company, six operators of U.S. Tax Planning franchises and seven Cayman Islands residents.    As previously reported, the IRS executed search warrants in the Cayman Islands and six U.S. cities after first sending an undercover agent to the Cayman Islands in 1982. </TEXT></DOC>
