Jean-Paul Kauffmann, a French journalist held by Shiite Moslemkidnappers in Lebanon for three years, marked the anniversary of thecapture of fellow hostage Terry Anderson with a wrenching plea forrekindled interest in the captives.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was captured four years ago today and has been held longerthan any of the other 14 Western hostages in Lebanon.   In today's editions of the newspaper Le Monde, Kauffmann says thehostages are no longer objects of mass compassion, no longerbargaining chips, no longer even political symbols.   ``The truth is that the hostages in Lebanon today have become thedamned of the West,'' he wrote. ``Without hope of being saved,imprisoned in silence and darkness, deprived of the sight of theworld of the living, forgotten, they no longer represent anything.''   Hostages such as Anderson are kept blindfolded and chained,robbed of their humanity, he wrote.   ``This absence of senses is the worst punishment that one caninflict on a human being. The most tragic thing is that this tormentis administered as much from the outside by countries and peopleindifferent to their fate as on the inside by their captors, whoalso work to make them `insignificant' as men.''   The captors ``condemned us to the chain, they made us blindbetter to bend us and subjugate us. We had to become things. Ahostage is above all a package, which is logical because he is theobject of a swap.''   He said Britain and the United States also consider the hostages``as merchandise'' and ``in believing they are devaluing thehostages by abandonment and silence ... have made them non-existent... The Western hostages no longer exist for anybody except fortheir families.''   Perhaps the governments ``think the kidnappers will end up bygetting tired and letting them go,'' Kauffmann said. ``But thiscalculation has proved false.''   France won the release of its countrymen because it ``cared aboutits hostages,'' he said. ``It was the spirit of solidarity of theFrench people that provoked the political will of the government.''   Nearly all Paris dailies today devoted stories to Anderson, whoalso was the subject of numerous radio reports. Radio France networkcarried reports on Anderson nearly every half hour during prime timemorning newscasts.   Charles Glass, an American journalist who escaped after twomonths of captivity in 1987, said in London:   ``Now is the time for the kidnappers and those for whom they workto release Terry Anderson and the other hostages in Lebanon and showthe world that they believe in the mercy of God.''   Hesham el Essawy, chairman of the London-based Islamic Societyfor the Promotion of Religious Tolerance, said: ``We hope and praythat this tragic situation will end soon. We are very confident thatthis aspiration will be supported by every honest Moslem in theworld today.''   Their statements were released through Article 19, ananti-censorship organization.   Also, the Australian Journalists' Association today called on theAustralian government to take whatever steps necessary to aid in therelease of the hostages. Association federal secretary ChristopherWarren said the group also has written Syria and Iran asking them tointervene.   Kauffmann was released May 4, 1988, with French diplomats MarcelFontaine and Marcel Carton. Islamic Jihad, the group that holdsAnderson, kidnapped Kauffmann on May 22, 1985.   Kauffmann spent his last six months of captivity in the companyof American hostages, first Thomas Sutherland, then Frank Reed.   Sutherland, 57, acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, was abducted June 9, 1985. Reed 56, directorof the Lebanese International School, was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
