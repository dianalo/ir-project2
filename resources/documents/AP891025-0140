(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An earthquake-flattened freeway is withinsteps of West Oakland's Cole School, an oasis of learning in acrack-infested, crime-ridden, low-income housing project.   And as the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders trickled back toclass this week, they were encouragd to talk about their personalfears to help soothe any psychological jolts left over from thequake.   ``I thought I was going to die. At first I thought it was thewashing machine. Then we heard plates falling,'' said Jamaal Brown,10.   ``I saw cars crushed on the freeway and the bodies were inthere. It's bad,'' said one fourth-grader, sitting cross-legged ina circle of children sharing his feelings with a group.   ``My grandmother had a heart attack,'' said another.   ``My fish tank broke and all the fish died,'' one added.   ``I tried to run but I couldn't. I had to crawl,'' a studentsaid.   Psychologists throughout Northern California have encouragedschools to help children cope with the disruptions of the Oct. 17earthquake. Warning signs of anxiety are trouble sleeping, clingingto parents or being excessively quiet.   ``Children experience an earthquake differently,'' said ShirleyReece, chief social worker for child psycholology at Langley PorterPsychiatric Hospital of the University of California at SanFrancisco.   ``They feel terribly powerless. And if they see it in the papersor on TV, the earthquake happens over and over. They are simplybeing retraumatized,'' she said.   At the Cole School, which is decorated for Halloween, studentstalked, drew pictures and wrote quake-related poems. The buildingis one block away from Interstate 880 and four blocks from asection of the elevated roadway that collapsed, killing dozens ofpeople.   There were special feelings about the plight of 6-year-old JulioBerumen, who was trapped in the carnage. Firefighters had to cutthrough his dead mother's body with a chain saw so doctors couldamputate his right leg and free him.   ``They shouldn't have put that on the news about that boy. Thatwas terrible. That was personal,'' said Toral George, 10.   Edson Mejia, a sixth-grader, drew a picture in crayon of thedouble-decked roadway. It showed columns cracking in half, carssandwiched between layers of concrete and passengers in cars.   ``I felt sorry for the people stuck in there,'' said Mejia. ``Itsounded like a bomb.''   About 135 people from the neighborhood were evacuated becauseofficials feared still-standing portions of the shaky roadway couldfall. Some students require passes from police to pass under theroad, visible as the students jumped double-dutch rope and playedbasketball at recess.   ``Every time they look at the freeway, they're reminded of it.They're reminded there are still bodies out there,'' saidsixth-grade teacher Claudia Bilbao.   There are other reminders. Near the cafeteria, a seismometer wasinstalled by Columbia University to measure aftershocks. Teachersalso used the device for their science classes.   One tangible fear was aftershocks and reports that the quakethat hit, as devastating as it was, wasn't even the Big One thatscientists fear.   ``There's going to be another one. It's going to be so big, theground will open up and we'll all fall in a hole,'' said SpiritWilliams, 11.   ``Nobody sleeps. There's going to be another in the middle ofthe night,'' said Shamezo Lunukanea, 10.   ``My mother said she's going pack all her clothes and move toMississippi,'' said Tenysha Foster, 10.   Faye McHellen, a fourth-grade teacher, tried to calm fears witha group discussion.   ``It was a natural catastrophe. If you and your family werescared, it was perfectly understandable. We had no control overit,'' she told students soothingly.   She asked students to write a vertical poem, in which the firstletters of the lines spell earthquake, about their experience,including this one from Akpanabio Lumukanda:   ``Everyone frightened.   ``All suffering.   ``Rocking and cracking.   ``Taking care of their children.   ``Home destroyed.   ``Quaking house.   ``Under the freeway.   ``Allowing people to go to the Red Cross.   ``Kind people helped homeless children.   ``Earthquakes are scary.''</TEXT></DOC>
