The Navy already has begun to carry out some recommendations andhas canceled orders for 11 million small plastic bags for use incarrying purchases away from ships' stores, the committee said.   The committee was organized last year by the Keystone Center, agroup of environmental mediators based in Keystone, Colo., inanticipation of legisation passed later to implement aninternational agreement to end disposal of plastic trash at sea.   Environmentalists increasingly are concerned over the killing ofbirds, fish and marine mammals by long-lasting plastics such assix-pack rings that are eaten by or entangle sea creatures.   ``We are trying to reverse a tradition of millennia'' of trashdisposal at sea, said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., at the newsconference where the recommendations were presented.   `The Navy's initial position was that it couldn't possiblycomply; that it would take at least 20 years,'' said Studds, who ischairman of the fisheries, wildlife conservation and environmentsubcommittee of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.   The Keystone committee said such skepticism was quickly turnedinto enthusiastic cooperation, largely as a result of the work ofNancy Stehle, deputy director for the environment in the office ofthe assistant secretary of the Navy for shipbuilding and logistics.   She ``set the example and established the tone we all needed forfrankness and openness. She focused our attention on helping theNavy solve the problem,'' the committee said.   Warships pose a particular problem because space aboard them isvery limited.   The recommendations call for reducing the plastics carriedbecause that would ``greatly reduce the need for expensivetechnologies intended to facilitate storage and disposal.''   The committee said the Navy should review specifications forfood and other items to buy them in degradable, non-plasticpackaging whereever possible, support development of compactors anddegradable plastics, unload unnecessary plastics before leavingport and separate plastics for carriage home before disposing ofother trash at sea.   In addition to representatives of the Navy, congressional staffsand the Keystone Center, the committee had members from theAmerican Cetacean Society, the Animal Protection Institute ofAmerica, the Oceanic Society, Defenders of Wildlife, the Center forEnvironmental Education, the Texas Environmental Coalition, theNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Monitor Consoritum andGreenpeace.   The Navy must report to Congress in three years on its progressin complying with the international agreement on plastic disposalafter five years.</TEXT></DOC>
