The ruling by U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders faultedthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., among others, forrepaying only a fraction of funds owed by Texas American'slead bank to 13 solvent affiliates after regulators closedthe lead bank last July.</LP><TEXT>   The incomplete repayment caused a chain reaction offailures in the otherwise solvent banks, allowing the FDIC tocomplete a previously negotiated sale of Texas American'sentire bank network to a Dallas investor group.   But Judge Sanders held that, because some non-affiliatedcreditors of the lead bank received 100 cents on the dollarowed them, the FDIC's action violated a 19th century bankinglaw requiring that all creditors of a failed bank be treatedequally.   &quot;The facts of this case indicate an . . . egregious use ofthe FDIC's extensive (but not unlimited) powers bymanipulating the recovery of affiliated banks on theobligations owed to them in order to make those banksinsolvent as well,&quot; he wrote.   The FDIC's liability in the case is minimal: As part of anegotiated settlement of various legal disputes with TexasAmerican, the agency had already agreed to pay no more than$5 million if Judge Sanders ruled against it.   What's more, Judge Sanders' ruling probably won't have anyimpact on future bailouts becauses the 1989 FinancialInstitution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act gaveregulators expanded power to favor one group of creditorsover others.   The ruling represented a particularly stinging rebuke tothe FDIC, coming, as it did, in the wake of several othercourt decisions against banking regulators.   Just last week, for example, a federal bankruptcy judgehere ruled that the FDIC can't use a $1 billion claim againstFirst RepublicBank for voting purposes when creditors decidethe fate of the company's plan to emerge from bankruptctycourt proceedings.   Mark Rosen, a deputy general counsel for the FDIC, saidthe agency was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the ruling and is likely toappeal.   The decision, if upheld in other cases stemming from pastbailouts, could wind up costing the government hundreds ofmillions of dollars. For example, First RepublicBank Corp.,which lost its 40-bank network in a 1988 federal bailout withstrong parallels to Texas American's, has asserted that 35 ofits banks failed through so-called &quot;manufacturedinsolvencies.&quot; The Dallas bank holding company, which isn'trelated to First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco, claimsthat those banks were worth almost $1 billion before theywere sold to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
