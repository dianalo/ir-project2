<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-1126 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method of medical diagnosis of toxic elements, using a neutron beamfrom a mobile nuclear reactor to perform partial-body in-vivo promptgamma-ray activation technique, has been developed. Both neutron andgamma-ray dose equivalents in an irradiated phantom and around medicalresearchers were measured and evaluated. Neutron flux at various kineticenergies was measured using an activation foil technique, and the neutrondose equivalents at tissues of risk inside the irradiated phantom werecalculated by neutron transport code. Gamma-ray dose equivalents insidethe irradiated phantom and around the nuclear reactor were measured bythermoluminescent dosimeters. The risk associated with the neutron andgamma radiation dose equivalents received by both the irradiated phantomand medical researchers were evaluated in detail. The radiation safetyof the in-vivo medical diagnosis using the mobile nuclear reactor, underthe context of radiation protection guidelines, is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
