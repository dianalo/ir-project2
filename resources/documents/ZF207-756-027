I tried to experience whatit's like being a Soviet citizen, but I always had the luxury of escaping toa hard-currency shop to buy some tinned milk in extremis.andP;  (Even as ahunter-gatherer, I had access to better fields than the natives did.) Butbest of all was the knowledge that in May I'd be back in the US.andM;That knowledge was certainly shared by all the people I talked to.andP;  How canyou thank someone for an &quot;interesting&quot; conversation about his despair? Buthow can you say &quot;it's horrifying&quot; and walk away? I listened at length to ahalf-Georgian who had just returned from riot-torn Georgia, and to anotherman who had helped out after the Armenian earthquake.andP;  It's one thing tocomplain about the inefficiency with which swimming pools are run; what canyou say when people die horrible deaths because of government inefficiencyand malign neglect?andM;I interviewed no high government officials and collected few facts orstatistics.andP;  Overall, I consider most of them meaningless, and officialsdisagree enough among themselves that I'm content to rely on the press forour overviews and trust our own judgements on the reality of living andworking day to day within one small community in the Soviet Union.andP;  I don'tspend much time interviewing government or high corporate officials in the USeither.andP;  The power structure is inscrutable, the future is unknowable, andthe present is in the details people face every day.andP;  Too much clarity wouldbe deceiving.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
