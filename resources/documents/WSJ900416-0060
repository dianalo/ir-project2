The government taught them for 20years that the more obat, or pesticides, they sprayed, thehealthier their rice crops would be. It was inexpensive too:The government sold a dollar's worth for only 15 cents.   It seemed to work. With new hybrid seeds, irrigationwater, and plenty of fertilizer and obat, rice yields soared.In 1976, Indonesia was the world's biggest rice importer. By1983, it was growing enough rice to feed itself.</LP><TEXT>   Then on Nov. 5, 1986, President Suharto issued a startlingdecree: no more obat. Chemical sprays, he said, were doingmore harm than good. Specifically, they were helpingpopulations of one rice pest, the brown planthopper, toexplode. Therefore, he said, he was banning 57 highly toxicinsecticides from use on rice.   Indonesia, he declared would henceforth use the&quot;alternative agriculture&quot; techniques of integrated pestmanagement, or IPM, to control rice pests: essentially,letting good bugs control bad bugs, with milder pesticidesheld for emergencies.   The Suharto decree is only beginning to be felt, but 3 1/2years later the president remains deeply committed to cuttingback on agricultural chemicals, according to four of hiscabinet ministers.   IPM experiments have been set up in other countries, butIndonesia's is the most closely watched because of its sizeand scope. As IPM promoters point out, conversion topesticide-free agriculture has occurred among a limitednumber of specialized &quot;organic&quot; farmers in the U.S., but thisisn't that. This is the president of the world's fifthmost-populous nation and third largest rice-producing nation(after China and India) reversing a tenet on growing the foodon which its economy and stability depend.   (Last September the National Academy of Sciencesrecommended similar steps toward &quot;alternative agriculture&quot;for U.S. farmers. U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed,saying that emphasis on &quot;natural&quot; farming methods andde-emphasis on chemicals would gradually become the norm iffarmers are to reduce the high costs, erosion and pollutionproblems associated with agricultural chemicals.)   &quot;Our farmers . . . have been encouraged to use pesticidesto protect their crops,&quot; says Johannes B. Sumarlin, who asIndonesia's planning minister helped sell IPM to Suharto.&quot;Now we are telling them they cannot do this, that they areto rely primarily on the natural enemies of rice destroyingpests to control them.   &quot;The broad use of pesticides, part of the agriculturalprogram in Indonesia and other rice-growing nations for some20 years, does more harm than good because it does more toeliminate the natural enemies of pests than the peststhemselves.&quot;   Since the Suharto decree, say senior ministers, overallpesticide use has dropped, rice yields haven't suffered andmajor insect infestations haven't occurred. Test plots showthat farmers can increase yields without routine spraying. Anationwide training program is under way to train IPMteachers, pest monitors and extension agents. The goal is totrain 2.5 million of Indonesia's 10 million land-owning ricefarmers by the end of 1994.   To break farmers of the habit of routine spraying, thegovernment reduced pesticide subsidies in stages, eliminatingthem completely in January 1989. This saved the government$100 million a year in subsidies and also caused retailpesticide prices to rise, making farmers consider the cost ofa habit that was once almost free.   Suharto banned the 57 most toxic of 66 insecticides incommon use in Indonesia, all of them broad-spectrumorganophosphates. Their makers had about half of the $170million Indonesian market in crop pesticides. Although thesecompounds can still be sold for use on vegetables andplantation crops, production has plummeted. The country'sbiggest producer, P.T. Bayer Indonesia, a unit of WestGermany's Bayer AG, dropped to 6,490 tons in 1987 from 11,697tons in 1986. Other big producers reported productiondeclines averaging 50%. Cans and bottles of these pesticidesmust be labeled, &quot;Banned for use on rice,&quot; though shopkeepersinterviewed in several villages in Central Java said manyfarmers ignore the label.   Pesticide makers criticized the ban on organophosphates,saying farmers needed them to fight other harmful rice pestssuch as stemborers and leaffolders. But they generallyapplauded the new &quot;deregulated&quot; market. By eliminatingsubsidies, the government largely took itself out ofpesticide distribution, causing manufacturers to set upmarketing and promotion systems down into the villages.   The nine pesticides still allowed for use on rice fieldsare narrow-spectrum carbamates that generally kill specificinsects, and one Japanese chemical that inhibits the moltingprocess in planthopper larvae but doesn't kill planthopperpredators. Tokyo gave Indonesia $16 million to buy a year'ssupply from the Japanese company that makes it.   What compelled Suharto's 1986 reversal was a tinyrice-destroying insect called the brown planthopper, the mostserious insect pest in rice. It sucks the sap of the riceplant, weakening it, and spreads plant viruses. Planthopperepidemics struck in the late 1970s in India, Indonesia,Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, the Solomon Islands,Thailand and Vietnam.   The insect spread rapidly because modern rice varietiesare planted close together and, when fertilized andirrigated, grow lots more leaves and stalks than traditionalvarieties. Irrigation gives the ability to grow rice all yearround, so there's no fallow dry season to break theplanthopper's lifecycle.   Also, insecticide spraying killed the hopper's naturalpredators and parasites. Roughly 120 species of insects andspiders eat planthoppers or otherwise kill them. By 1986, aplanthopper outbreak threatened to make a mockery of theSuharto regime's proudest achievement: rice self-sufficiency.More and more pesticides did less and less good, and ageneral election was coming up.   Indonesian and foreign scientists convinced seniorministers who, in turn, convinced Suharto that spraying wasactually worsening the outbreaks by killing the leafhoppers'natural enemies but not leafhopper eggs. The eggs hatched,unhindered by natural enemies. Populations exploded.   U.S. entomologist Peter Kenmore, the United Nations Foodand Agricultural Organization's chief IPM promoter, praisesthe &quot;political will&quot; of Indonesia's leaders, saying they aregiving the country &quot;the most modern, flexible, andscientifically sound field pest management system of anycountry in the Third World.&quot;   Mr. Kenmore said that the contribution of pesticides tothe enormous growth in rice yields had been overrated. Heattributes 50% of yield increases to irrigation, which allowssteady water levels year round. An additional 20% to 30% ofincreased yields is due to fertilizer, he says, while the newhybrid seeds probably account for 10%.</TEXT></DOC>
