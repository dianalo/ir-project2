The Communist Party, whose members constitute 80 percent of thenew Congress of People's Deputies, convened a session of itspolicy-making Central Committee today to work out its plans for thebody, which meets in inaugural session Thursday.   But many of the 2,250 members of the new congress areindependent-minded Communists, and it was not known if they wouldfollow the party line.   Yeltsin, a one-time Moscow party boss, is himself a member ofthe party's 251-member Central Committee and at Sunday's rally heand his anti-establishment colleagues called for contestedpresidential elections and urgent action on the economy.   He demanded that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev give a publicaccounting of the first four years of his reforms during theopening session. Only then should the congress decide if Gorbachevshould be re-elected president, Yeltsin declared.   The reformers' talk of specific legislative proposals indicatedthey may try to create a congress with far greater power thanGorbachev may have intended. According to legislation approved lastfall, the body would have just one regular session a year and electfrom among its members the president as well as the smaller,working parliament, the Supreme Soviet.   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov told Sunday's rally thatthe congress itself, not the Supreme Soviet, should be the supremelegislative authority.   The congress, directly elected by the people and a number ofofficial organizations, includes hundreds of reformers.   It is not clear if the reformers constitute a large enoughfaction to win selection to the working parliament.   The party's intentions remained unclear. All 12 full members ofits ruling Politburo were elected deputies but it was not known ifthey intend to serve in the Supreme Soviet as well.   Many Soviets hope the congress will take swift action onproblems ranging from empty store shelves to the unresolved ethnicconflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.   The radical tone of Sunday's rally, which drew an estimated at30,000 people, was demonstrated by the loud cheers that greetedDeputy Alexander Tolstoukhov's suggestion that ``we should electtrue people's power with a true people's president: Yeltsin!''   Yeltsin was ousted as Moscow party boss in November 1987 andlost his seat on the party's ruling Politburo after he criticizedthe slow pace of Gorbachev's reforms.   He made a comeback in the March congressional elections,however, when his anti-establishment platform captured almost 90percent of the vote in Moscow.   Yeltsin on Sunday called for convening an ``extraordinary partycongress'' that would be empowered to replace old guard Communistson the Central Committee and Politburo.   He said a group of 39 deputies elected to represent Moscow inthe new congress has drafted its own agenda for the session anddemands ``radical decisions'' on reviving the stagnant economy,guaranteeing social justice and developing a more open society.   Yeltsin said that only after addressing that agenda andevaluating Gorbachev's performance should the congress proceed ``toelect the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet fromamong alternative candidates.''   Gorbachev was unanimously elected to that post without anopponent on Oct. 1. But that election was by the Supreme Soviet,which has until recently been a rubber stamp legislature.   Two prosecutors who have been accused of abusing their office inconducting a probe of alleged official corruption also addressedthe rally to deafening cheers.   Nikolai Ivanov, who was accused of slander after he saidpublicly the names of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev and formerPolitburo member Mikhail S. Solomentsev came up in his probe,called for a wider investigation of former high officials.   Fellow prosecutor and deputy Telman Gdlyan said the party andgovernment apparatus ``is scared by the people.'' The Soviet Union,he said, ``is in the very depths of an economic, political, moraland legal crisis.'' He demanded that apparatchiks ``give up powerto the people.''</TEXT></DOC>
