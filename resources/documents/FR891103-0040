Refuge fishing programs are reviewed annuallyto determine whether the regulations governing fishing on individual refugesshould be modified. Changing environmental conditions, state and Federalregulations and other factors affecting fish populations and habitats maywarrant such amendments. The modifications would ensure the continued compatibilityof fishing with the purposes for which the individual refuges involvedwere established and, to the extent practical, make refuge fishing programsconsistent with state regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before December 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send comments to: Assistant Director, Refuges and Wildlife,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 18th and C Streets, NW., MS 670-ARLSQ,Washington, DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Larry LaRochelle, Division ofRefuges, Fish and Wildlife Service, 18th and C Streets NW., MS 670-ARLSQ,Washington, DC 20240; Telephone 703-358-2043.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>50 CFR part 33 contains the provisionsthat govern fishing on NWRs. Fishing is regulated on refuges to (1) ensurecompatibility with primary refuge purposes, (2) properly manage the fisheryresource and (3) protect other refuge values. On many refuges, the Servicepolicy of adopting state fishing regulations is an adequate way of meetingthese objectives. On other refuges it is necessary to supplement stateregulations with refuge-specific fishing regulations which will ensurethat the Service meets its management responsibilities, as outlined underthe section entitled ``Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities,''These regulations may list the seasons, methods of taking fish, descriptionsof open areas and other provisions. The Service has previously issued refuge-specificfishing regulations in 50 CFR part 33. Refuge-specific fishing regulationsare issued only after the final publication of the opening of a wildliferefuge to fishing.This proposed rule would amend and supplement certain refuge-specific regulationsin 50 CFR part 33, andSection;andSection; 33.8 through 33.51, which pertainto fishing on individual refuges in their respective alphabetically listedstate.The policy of the Department of the Interior (Department) is, wheneverpracticable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in therulemaking process. It is, therefore, the purpose of this proposed rulemakingto seek public input regarding the proposed amendments to refuge-specificfishing regulations. Accordingly, interested persons may submit writtencomments concerning this proposal to the Assistant Director, Refuges andWildlife (address above), by the end of the comment period. All substantivecomments will be considered by the Department prior to issuance of a finalrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities</ITAG>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966,as amended (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act (RRA) of 1962(16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of NWRs. Specifically,section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior(Secretary), under such regulations as he may prescribe, to permit theuse of any area within the System for any purpose, including but not limitedto hunting, fishing, public recreation and accommodations and access whenhe determines that such uses are compatible with the major purposes forwhich such areas were established.The RRA authorizes the Secretary to administer refuge areas within theNational Wildlife Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriateincidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable andnot inconsistent with the primary purposes for which the area was established.The RRA also authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to carry outthe purposes of the Act.Fishing plans are developed for each fishing program on a refuge priorto its opening to fishing. In many cases, refuge-specific fishing regulationsare included as part of fishing plans to ensure the compatibility of thefishing programs with the purposes for which the refuge was established.Compliance with the NWRSAA and RRA is ensured when fishing plans are developedand the determinations required by these Acts are made prior to the additionof the refuge to the list of areas open to fishing in 50 CFR part 33. Continuedcompliance is ensured by annual review of fishing programs and regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires the preparation of regulatory impact analysesfor major rules. A major rule is one likely to result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in cost or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, government agencies or geographicregions; or significant adverse effects on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises. The Regulatory FlexibilityAct of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions.The proposed amendments to the codified refuge-specific fishing regulationswould make relatively minor adjustments to existing fishing programs. Theregulations are not expected to have any gross economic effect and willnot cause an increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local governments, agencies or geographic regions. Thebenefits accruing to the public are expected to exceed the costs of administeringthis rule. Accordingly, the Department has determined that this rule isnot a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 and willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Service has approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for the information collection requirements of these regulations pursuantto the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements are presently approved by OMB ascited below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,xls48</C> <H1>Type of information collection</H1><H1>OMB approval No.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Economic and public use permits <D>1018-0014</D></ITAG></ITAG>Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average six (6) minutesper response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering andmaintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form. Direct commentson the burden estimate or any other aspect of this form to: InformationCollection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington,DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork ReductionProject (1018-0014), Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543)is ensured when fishing plans are developed and the determinations requiredby these Acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the list ofareas open to sport fishing in 50 CFR part 33. Refuge-specific fishingregulations are subject to a categorical exclusion from the NEPA processif they do not significantly alter the existing use of a particular refuge.The changes proposed in this rulemaking would not significantly alter theexisting uses of the refuges involved.Information regarding the conditions that apply to individual refuge fishingprograms, any restrictions related to public use on the refuge and a mapof the refuge are available at refuge headquarters.
