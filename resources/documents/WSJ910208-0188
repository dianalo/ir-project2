Energy Secretary James Watkins, releasing an 18-monthstudy, said yesterday that the Bush administration won't makea final decision on how to reshape the complex until late1993. In the meantime, the department is studying two mainoptions: a major reorganization that would reduce thefacilities to six or seven sites from the current 13 and amodest upgrading and consolidation that would leave almostall existing sites intact.</LP><TEXT>   The scaling back reflects the post-Cold War lessening ofthe nuclear threat from the Soviet Union, the need forincreased attention to environmental and safety concerns, andbudgetary considerations. Some critics of the department havecalled for more rapid shrinking of the complex than the studyenvisions. At the same time, it remains to be seen whetherlawmakers will be willing to accept the loss of jobs expectedin their states.   The department is using different estimates of the numberof nuclear weapons that the nation will need, ranging from70% to only 15% of the current stockpile. Cost estimatesrange from $6.7 billion to $15.2 billion, with the work to becompleted by 2015.   Spending on reconfiguration would be in addition to theestimated $100 billion needed to clean up environmentaldamage at the facilities during the next 30 years.   Officials said that Mr. Watkins wants to move thenuclear-production facilities at Rocky Flats in Colorado toanother site, possibly consolidating its function withproduction facilities at Amarillo, Texas, and Oak Ridge,Tenn.   Five existing locations are being considered for housingthis consolidated manufacturing facility. These are the sitesat Amarillo and Oak Ridge, the Savannah River facility inSouth Carolina, the Hanford site in Washington and anengineering laboratory in Idaho. Some sites that aren'tcurrently part of the weapons complex may also be considered.   Another option, officials said, would be to consolidateall non-nuclear manufacturing facilities in a single site.These are currently at six sites. The department also islooking at ways to streamline and consolidate the functionsof its research laboratories.   Mr. Watkins said the department is launching a three-year,$38 million environmental-impact study that will includemeetings around the country to gauge public reaction to theoptions.</TEXT></DOC>
