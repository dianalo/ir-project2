Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin signed legislation totemporarily ban the commercial use and sale in the state of agenetically engineered hormone that increases milk productionby dairy cows.   The governor's action was claimed as a victory byopponents of the hormone, who had argued that it would hurtdairy farmers by causing a milk glut and forcing milk priceslower.</LP><TEXT>   But whether a temporary ban would delay the marketing ofthe hormone for long remained unclear, since it still mustget marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administrationanyway.   For several manufacturers -- Monsanto Co., Eli Lilly andamp;Co., Upjohn Co. and American Cyanamid Co. -- the hormone isthe first potentially big product to emerge from agriculturalbiotechnology. Some estimates of the world-wide market rangeas high as $1 billion annually.   A Monsanto spokesman said, &quot;We'll continue battling andare confident that in the long run the product's merits willcarry the day.&quot;   Mr. Thompson approved a ban on the hormone, called bovinegrowth hormone (BGH) or bovine somatotropin, until June 1,1991. At the same time, he vetoed another measure that wouldhave extended the ban until July 1, 1991, or six months afterFDA approval, whichever came later. The FDA is expected toapprove BGH this year or next.   Whether to ban BGH has been a hot issue in Wisconsin forseveral years. Mr. Thompson, a Republican who is up forre-election in November, had indicated his opposition tostronger bans but hadn't publicly disclosed until Friday howhe would respond to the latest bills to pass the statelegislature.   The governor said his action would provide &quot;sufficienttime to allow for additional farmer and consumer education onthe use&quot; of BGH &quot;without compromising Wisconsin's ability tocompete&quot; in milk markets.   Opponents of BGH have argued that any drop in milk pricesbecause of its use would particularly hurt small dairyfarmers. Among the opposition have been small-farm groups andthe Foundation on Economic Trends, which is headed by theanti-biotechnology activist Jeremy Rifkin.   State Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat who sponsoredanti-BGH bills, called the product part of a &quot;technologicaltreadmill&quot; that is forcing small farmers out of business. Inaddition to the economic issue, the opponents say, somequestions about the safety of BGH need more study.   The companies that developed the hormone maintain that itsuse wouldn't favor big farmers over small, and that itwouldn't disrupt the dairy-farm economy more than haveprevious innovations, like artificial insemination. Farmersin various states have volunteered to take part in BGHtrials.   As for safety, the companies note that FDA officials havealready said milk from BGH-treated cows is safe for humanconsumption; continuing studies focus on the health effect ondairy herds.   BGH, a protein that is nearly identical to a growthhormone that cows produce naturally, is manufactured byfermentation. The gene encoding the protein is inserted intobacteria, which then produce the protein in quantity.Injected into cows, BGH has boosted milk production 10% to25%.   Opponents of BGH said the they expect the temporary ban inWisconsin to help their efforts in other leading dairystates. For one thing, the Wisconsin law appears strongenough to activate a one-year ban in Minnesota, which wascontingent on action in Wisconsin or other states.</TEXT></DOC>
