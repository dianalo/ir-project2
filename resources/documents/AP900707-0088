The comparison may be apt. Kohl is a strong position to becomethe first chancellor of a united Germany. And as military mightrecedes as a measure of world power, Germany is certain to expandits international influence as an economic giant.   Kohl has not been shy about wielding his influence. He hasbluntly called the 1990s ``the decade of the Europeans.''   He has become a champion of economic aid for the Soviet Union, amessage he will take to the economic summit in Houston afterraising the issue at the just-ended NATO meeting in London.   In Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, the chancellor notesapprovingly, there is already talk of applying for membership inthe European Community following the collapse of communism.   For Kohl, the greater the steps toward full Europeanintegration, the greater the chances for stability that will extendthe continent's longest period without war in centuries.   The conservative Christian Democrat, 60, has been in officenearly eight years. Still, he retains many of the folksy touchesthat appeal to the solid conservative majority at home, and asimilar bloc of voters in East Germany.   During the NATO summit, Kohl sat and regaled reporters for morethan an hour late one night, mixing a keen sense of history, humorand frequent stinging barbs at the politicians he has known overthe years.   Diplomatically, Kohl strictly banned any repeat of thosecomments, but his closing news conference on Friday brought outseveral quips.   Asked the reason for his close ties with U.S. President GeorgeBush, the chancellor said: ``Well, right off, I could say it'sbecause we are such good politicians. That's the first answer thatcomes to mind.   ``Of course, that's not the answer I'll give, but I naturallylike it when people say and write that,'' the chancellor added witha smile.   Instead, Kohl said of his relationship with Bush, ``thechemistry is right, as you say in the United States.''   When asked about an apparent rift in East Berlin over NATOmembership for a united Germany, Kohl said such the dispute was ``aspecialty of the East German government.'' He quickly added thatoccasional disagreements are hallmarks of democratically electedgovernments.   A man of huge dimensions _ 6-feet-3-inches tall and 235 pounds _Kohl towers over most of his European counterparts.   Two of those leaders, 64-year-old British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand oftenbicker predictably at European summits.   That has left Kohl in charge of much of the EC's direction,guiding the community's integration on a parallel track with Germanunification.   The twofold strategy is important for a country still acutelyaware of international wariness of a powerful Germany after thecatastrophic experiences of two World Wars.   ``We have learned the lessons of history,'' Kohl told the Bushand the 14 other NATO leaders, echoing a statement he has made timeand again.   Kohl once infuriated Jews by referring to the ``mercy of thoseborn later,'' which Jewish leaders interpreted as an attempt on thepart of younger Germans to wash their hands of the Holocaust.   Despite that and other occasional gaffes, the chancellor hasheld on to power during some of the most tumultuous years in hiscountry's nearly 41-year history.   They include the massive resistance to the installation ofmedium-range nuclear missiles in West Germany in 1983 and the EastGerman unrest that broke down the Berlin Wall last November.   Earlier this year, there were predictions that Kohl could gethit by an anti-unification backlash among West Germans tired ofseeing their country awash in handout-seeking East Germans.   However, two recent public opinion polls indicate that Kohl hasregained the momentum in his bid to become the first chancellor ofa united Germany after joint elections expected in December.   A poll conducted by the respected INFAS institute and releasedFriday said Kohl enjoys a 56 percent approval rating, compared with37 percent for his Social Democratic challenger Oskar Lafontaine.   The SPD and others have criticized Kohl, saying he has beenpushing forward with unification too quickly at the risk ofcreating instability in East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
