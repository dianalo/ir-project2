<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-65-0378 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two different solids, d-camphor (molecular) and silver iodide (ionic),are investigated as a function of temperature, using positron lifetimespectroscopy (LS) and Doppler broadening of annihilation radiation lineshape(DBARL) techniques in conjunction. Substantial positronium formationis found in both matrices. In d-camphor, the reconstructive phase transitionof the plastic phase at 374 K is evidenced. However, the variations ofthe LS parameters only qualitatively agree with predictions from thefree volume model. No discontinuity in the experimental data is observedin AgI, even at the transition to the superionic conducting {alpha}-phase.This absence of effect, particularly on e/sup +/, is attributed to thevery short dynamic lifetime of the cation vacancy, not allowing for positrontrapping. Comparing the DBARL to the LS data shows that increasing thetemperature or changing the phase can result in changes not only in theLS parameters, but also in the momentum distribution of the various positronstates. In d-camphor in particular, the changes in the latter would occurroughly in proportion to those of the lifetimes.</TEXT></DOC>
