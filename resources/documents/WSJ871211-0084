LeeStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TWTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   An investor group led by Ronald O. Perelman said that it sought regulatory clearance to raise its stake in TW Services Inc. to more than 15% and that it might seek control of the company.    A TW spokesman said that the company isn't opposed to a buyout or acquisition proposal but that &quot;current market prices undervalue the company.&quot; He added that he couldn't say what price would pique the company's interest.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the Perelman group also said it requested that one or two of its &quot;designees&quot; be elected to the board of the New York-based food and vending services concern. But TW rejected the request Wednesday, the filing added.    The Perelman group, which holds 14.9% of TW, said it might increase its holding to as much as 24.9%, and said it reserves the right to buy more than 25%, subject to making another filing with federal antitrust regulators.    While the filing said the group hasn't decided whether to seek control of the company, it sets the stage for a renewal of the group's possible grab for assets formerly held by Transworld Corp. TW was formed last December as the successor to Transworld, which liquidated itself in the face of a takeover threat from the Perelman group. Mr. Perelman is chairman of Revlon Group Inc., New York.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, TW shares rose $2.50 to $15. With 48.6 million shares outstanding, it has an indicated market value of about $729 million.    In the filing, the Perelman group said it wants to increase its TW holdings &quot;based in part upon the substantial decline in the market price of the common stock in recent months.&quot; The company's shares recently has been trading just over $10 a share, down from August's high for the past year of nearly $23.    The Perelman group declined to elaborate on its SEC filing, but a person familiar with Revlon said the group has &quot;$105 million invested in the company and has been sitting by watching the stock's performance for nearly a year.&quot;    The filing said the Perelman group Wednesday petitioned the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to gain clearance to raise its holdings above 15%. By buying 345,000 shares Oct. 29 and Oct. 30 for $13.75 to $15.125 each, the group increased its stake fractionally to 7.2 million shares.    The assets TW retained from Transworld include Spartan Food Systems, a restaurant company; Canteen Corp., a food service concern; and American Medical Services, a nursing home concern. Trans World Airlines was spun off from Transworld in 1984.    TW also owns Denny's Inc., a restaurant chain acquired in September.    For 1986, TW posted net income of $15.7 million, or 27 cents a share, on revenue of $1.9 billion. Profit included a net charge of $26.8 million, primarily from the liquidation of Transworld. </TEXT></DOC>
