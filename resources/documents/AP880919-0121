About 100people were reported killed in Rangoon.   Demonstrations also broke out it other cities, includingMandalay. Witnesses and other reports said a total of about 150people, including 17 soldiers, had died in the violence that sweptBurma after Sunday's coup.   The military placed the death toll at 23 Monday, but gave nodetails.   Military commander Saw Maung engineered the newest change inpower in Burma by overthrowing civilian President Maung Maung.   Undaunted opposition leaders vowed that students, Buddhist monksand striking civil servants would continue to demonstrate fordemocracy.   Maung Maung's whereabouts remain unknown.   A Western diplomat familiar with Burma said from Bangkok,Thailand, that ``We're into possibly one of the final acts now ...a naked confrontation with the army. ... Either the students win orthe army wins.''   The soldiers were trying to enforce a ban on public gatheringsimposed immediately after the coup by Saw Maung, the defenseminister before the coup and a right-hand man of former PresidentSein Lwin. Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after riots in which hundredsof protesters reportedly died.   Protesters blame the country's sole legal party, the rulingBurma Socialist Program Party, for 26 years of repression andeconomic ruin. Other analysts believe the military may have actedto simply assert its traditional authority.   Reports indicated soldiers shot at mostly unarmed protestersnear the main government administrative building, the U.S. Embassy,Sule Pagoda and Rangoon General Hospital. An Asian diplomat said 67people were admitted Monday at Rangoon General Hospital.   Witnesses said corpses were taken away by military trucks whileresidents dragged some of the dead and wounded into their houses orput them in three-wheeled taxis to be taken to hospitals.   In Washington, the Reagan administration said it was reviewingassistance programs to Burma that total $14 million annually todetermine whether aid should be cut off in light of the coup andviolence.   ``The United States urges Burmese military authoritiesimmediately to cease shooting at demonstrators and calls upon thosedemonstrating to refrain from provocative actions,'' White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.   Military spokesman Kyaw Sann said the clashes began Sunday nightwhen ``the violent mob attacked security forces with catapaults andjinglees (metal darts) and the troops had to disperse the mob byshooting in many parts of the town.''   Kyaw Sann said crowds Monday raided two police stations,stealing rifles, pistols and ammunition. There were reportsprotesters, some carrying swords, spears and crossbows, were takingthe weapons of fallen soldiers.   Troops used cranes and forklifts to clear roadblocksdemonstrators had erected. Witnesses said one boy was killed andsix people were wounded when troops fired on youths trying toremove a tree that had been used as a barrier.   ``Many students are being mowed down. Can't anything be done?''a reporter said by telephone from the scene of one confrontationbefore begining to cry.   Witnesses said they also saw two monks fall to the ground afterbeing hit by bullets near Sule Pagoda.   In the past month, strikes, demonstrations, looting andlawlessness have paralyzed the economy and pushed the nation to theverge of anarchy. Saw Maung in a statement to Radio Rangoon vowedto restore order and to ``hold general elections under a multipartysystem'' at an unspecified later date.   Opposition leaders said on Monday they would ``continue ourstruggle for democracy by various means until the goal isachieved.'' A joint statement was issued by former militaryofficers Aung Gyi and Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter ofthe late independence hero Aung San.   Troops at one point fired Monday on a crowd outside the U.S.Embassy in Rangoon, said the embassy's public affairs officer, JohnFredenburg.   ``It wasn't fighting between the troops and the demonstrators _it was really more troops firing on the demonstrators,'' Fredenburgtold Associated Press Radio.   ``There was a small group of young people outside the embassy,not demonstrating, but waiting outside the embassy. And furtherdown the street there was a group of people marching. ...   ``They were as far as we could tell unarmed and behaving in apeaceful manner. The troops opened fire on that group ofdemonstrators and then opened fire on the small group of a hundredor so people that were standing in front of the embassy at the sametime.   ``The procession of demonstrators may have numbered one to twothousand. ``When the firing died down and the ambulance came topick up the casualties, there were two people who appeared to havebeen killed and there was one wounded still lying in front of theembassy _ a young man who was shot in the upper body and was quitebloody.''   Maung Maung on Aug. 19 became the nation's first civilian leadersince the 1962 military coup by strongman Ne Win. Ne Win resignedin July after protests against his repressive rule.</TEXT></DOC>
