Despite the 13% gain in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index so far this year, portfolio managers seem to keep coming up with an ever-changing list of complaints about dark clouds on the horizon: economic uncertainty, fears that debt-heavy companies might collapse, the possibility of higher interest rates.    One sign of caution about the stock market: Cash positions of money managers are dwindling, but not much of the cash is going to buy stocks. Balanced accounts, which hold both stocks and bonds, were 48% invested in stocks as of Oct. 21, down from 53% shortly before the crash, according to Indata, a Stamford, Conn.-based research firm that tracks 2,400 institutional investment portfolios. Meanwhile, these accounts' holdings of long-term bonds climbed to 41% from 37%.    Even in equity accounts, where managers have reduced cash holdings to 7.1% from a peak of 8.1% in May, stocks have slipped to 88% of portfolios from 90%, Indata says. It defines equity accounts as those holding at most 5% in bonds.    &quot;We've been avoiding the market because we think the current takeover frenzy could be dangerous for the economy,&quot; says Don Yarling, a partner at Lemby-Yarling Inc. in Chicago, a small investment firm that manages about $55 million for institutions and individuals. &quot;I don't think the market will tank tomorrow, but we do see cracks in the foundation.&quot;    In the past two weeks, Mr. Yarling has sold stocks and raised the cash positions in his accounts to 50% from 25%, primarily by investing in six-month Treasury securities. In Mr. Yarling's view, too many corporate giants are excessively leveraged, which would create widespread economic upheaval if they falter. In addition, he believes that takeover speculation and &quot;greed&quot; among some leveraged buy-out specialists has pushed stock prices close to their peak, at least in the short term. &quot;When greed rules, prices are too high,&quot; he says.    Some larger money managers who focus on long-term forecasts are backing away from U.S. securities to dabble in stock abroad.    GTE Corp.'s $9 billion pension fund has a policy of maintaining 65% to 75% of its portfolio in equities. Fund manager John Carroll is replacing some domestic equities with foreign securities. His goal is to increase the GTE fund's international holdings from the current level of 17% to between 20% and 30% during the next five years.    &quot;We've been concerned about the U.S.'s ability to compete relative to other countries,&quot; says Mr. Carroll. His downbeat outlook is based on what he perceives as a declining educational level of the U.S. work force.    Thomas Prappas, chief economist and portfolio manager for Clemente Capital Corp. in New York, also favors foreign equities over domestic securities -- but for different reasons. Since June, Mr. Prappas has increased Clemente's international portfolio to 35% of holdings from 20% in the belief that domestic corporate profits will fall as the economy weakens.    &quot;Foreign markets will do better than the U.S.,&quot; he says. In investing abroad, Clemente will seek possible takeover candidates among financial institutions, chemical and electronic companies in West Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France. The European Common Market has set a 1992 deadline for integrating various stock market-related services of member nations. The change is expected to trigger a rash of mergers and acquisitions among companies in those countries.    Meanwhile, Mr. Prappas is moving assets out of companies based in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, primarily because businesses in those countries ship many products to the U.S., where he expects the economy to weaken.    Mellon Equity Associates in Pittsburgh moved part of the money in its balanced accounts away from stocks and into intermediate-term bonds in August and September. Richard Siefert, president of the concern, a Mellon Bank Corp. subsidiary with about $2.7 billion under management, uses asset-allocation models. They showed that the spread between returns on equities and bonds didn't justify keeping the maximum allowable part of the accounts in stocks.    &quot;Right now, our model says there is a standoff,&quot; which means he isn't shuffling his portfolio. In coming weeks, however, Mr. Siefert will be closely monitoring interest rates. If they rise, &quot;bonds will become even more attractive and we'll take the next step to further minimize our equity position.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity:   Stock prices climbed in sluggish trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 9.06 to close at 2149.89. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 146.3 million shares. Advancing issues were ahead of decliners 858 to 595.    For the week, the Dow Jones industrials were down 33.61 points.    Traders said takeovers and rumors of takeovers drove prices higher Friday. The Dow Jones industrials surged 16 points early in the day as investors moved to take advantage of Thursday's drop of more than 24 points. But prices retreated later in the morning as trading activity waned.    Teledyne was the biggest dollar gainer on the Big Board. It rose 10 1/8 to 333 3/4 after the company's board approved a buyback of as many as one million shares.    Among takeover stocks, RJR Nabisco gained 3 to 85; Kraft rose 2 1/4 to 96 1/2; Chicago Pacific was up 1 1/2 to 55 1/8, and West Point-Pepperell climbed 1 3/8 to 45 7/8.    General Motors soared 3 3/8 to 83 7/8, one day after posting surprisingly strong third-quarter results.    Rollins Environmental, which reported lower fourth-quarter earnings, lost 2 3/4 to 10 7/8. The stock was the most active on the Big Board, with five million shares changing hands.    Other big losers included Springs Industries, off 1 3/4 to 32 1/4; Fuqua Industries, down 1 5/8 to 31 1/8; Zurn Industries, which closed at 25 3/4, down 1 1/2, and Lomas andamp; Nettleton Financial, off 1 1/2 to 14 1/2.    Among blue chips, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph gained 3/4 to 28; International Business Machines was up 1/2 to 120 3/4; Union Carbide slipped 7/8 to 25 3/4, and Sears was up 3/8 to 43 5/8. </TEXT></DOC>
