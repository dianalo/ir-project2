Between June 1986 and April 1989, Digital exported orre-exported computer equipment without the requiredauthorization 31 times, the department said. The agencyalleged that Digital knew the authorization was required butdidn't obtain it. The unauthorized exports includedworkstations, video terminals and computer parts valued at$19 million, the agency said.   Mr. Fredrickson said Digital applied for licenses in allof the cases and eventually received them in 30 of the cases.The licenses, however, weren't granted until after theshipments were made, he said.   Mr. Fredrickson said $9.8 million of shipments went tocustomers in Singapore, $1.2 million to Israel and $900,000to China, with the rest spread among nine other countries.   &quot;It would be difficult to speculate as to the motives ofthe individuals involved; they have been separated from thecompany,&quot; said Mr. Fredrickson, who added that Digitalexpects the case to &quot;have no impact on our future ability toobtain export licenses.&quot;   Digital neither admitted nor denied the allegedviolations, the department said, but agreed to pay the fineas part of a consent decree.</TEXT></DOC>
