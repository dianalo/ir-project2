The Reagan administration has said it will not negotiate directlywith groups holding Americans hostage in Lebanon, although publicinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair showed that secret dealswere made with Iranian officials who apparently had influence withthe kidnappers.   ``I've never said that you don't negotiate,'' Dukakis said in aninterview on NBC's ``Today.'' ``You talk, you make every effort toget those hostages back home, but you never make concessions to thehostage takers.''   ``Mike Dukakis is going to work as hard as he possibly can,'' hesaid. ``First to have an anti-terrorism policy that's real and,secondly, to do everything he can to get those hostages and reunitethose families, but never, never do the kind of thing that we didwhen we traded arms to the ayatollah.''   He said the decision to trade arms to Iran during the Reagan-Bushadministration was ``one of the worst things that ever happened.''   ``You can't make concessions to terrorists if you're seriousabout fighting terrorism and stopping this hostage taking,'' Dukakissaid.   Bush, in his presidential campaign, has spoken of a need tostrike back at terrorists. He said in the first presidential debatethat the administration has made ``vast improvements in ouranti-terrorism'' since the arms-for-hostages dealing.   On efforts for peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors,Dukakis said he might travel to the Middle East as president ``if Ithought it would make a difference,'' but he expressed a preferencefor leaving such talks to his secretary of state.   ``There has been no progress for eight years, since the CampDavid Accords,'' he said. ``We're going to make it a priority.''</TEXT></DOC>
