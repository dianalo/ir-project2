Zenith said it made the concessions so that shareholders &quot;will not be distracted&quot; from the fight for control of the computer and electronics company. A spokesman declined to elaborate.    The shareholder group, New York-based Brookhurst Partners Limited Partnership, owns 6.1% of Zenith's common shares and is one of Zenith's largest stockholder groups. Brookhurst, claiming that Zenith management isn't acting in all shareholders' interests, wants to break up and sell Zenith.    The group has sued Zenith in Delaware court to try and mandate several changes in so-called poison pill provisions of Zenith's bylaws that make it more difficult to acquire or break up the company.    Zenith said that it amended its bylaws so that directors will be nominated annually as of the next annual meeting, rather than its current practice of staggering the elections over several years.    The company also eliminated a bylaw provision that required unanimous written consent from shareholders in lieu of acting at a shareholder meeting. Under the revised bylaws, Zenith requires a simple majority.    Peter C. Harkins, Brookhurst general counsel, said in a prepared statement: &quot;We are still waiting for Zenith management to give us, among other things, the company's stockholder list to which we are entitled under Delaware law.&quot;    He added: &quot;More importantly, we and other concerned shareowners are still waiting for the details of a realistic management plan to achieve and maintain profitability for Zenith. Until then we are committed to pursuing our plan to assure that all Zenith shareowners have a specific alternative to management's continuing review of options to achieve profitability.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
