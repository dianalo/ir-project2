(Topologically Integrated Geographic Encodingand Referencing)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lang, Laura.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Tiger (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding andReferencing) is a national, on-line geographic database.andP;  It wascreated by the US Geologic Survey and the Census Bureau for use inconducting and tabulating the 1990 census, and will be used tocreate affordable, automated mapping products.andP;  The final versionof the Tiger files, including census geographic codes for every UScounty, will be released after Jan 1991 at a cost of $200 for thefirst county, plus $25 for additional counties in the same state.andO;When coupled with CAD, mapping or geographic information systems(GIS), these files can be valuable reference sources forgeographic and demographic data.andP;  About 150 companies now plan tooffer software to work with Tiger, and most of this will solvelogistical problems or will target market research applications.andO;Many vendors express concern about the accuracy and bulk ofTiger's data, and consider its value limited for engineeringapplications.andP;  Critical errors in Tiger data are corrected as theyare detected, and users who realize that map components areconstantly changing, tend to accept the level of accuracy.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Product:   Tiger (Utility program) (usage).andO;Topic:     Data BasesOn-LineGeographyDemographyCensus.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
