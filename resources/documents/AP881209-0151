North beganusing Iranian arms-sale proceeds to arm Nicaraguan rebels two monthsbefore he told Congress the diversion had started, Iran-Contraprosecutors said Friday.   ``A substantial quantity of weapons'' were bought for the Contrasin December 1985 from money left over from the aborted sale byIsrael of Hawk missiles to Iran in November 1985, Iran-Contraprosececutors said in filing in North's case.   The prosecution evidence contradicts North's congressionaltestimony last year that the idea of diverting arms-sale profits tothe Contras was first suggested to him in January 1986 by Iranianarms dealer Manuchar Ghorbanifar.   The weapons for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, werepurchased from what was left of a $1 million fund that North toldIsrael to place in a Swiss bank. The money was to cover the expensesthat arms dealer Richard V. Secord would incur when selling 80 Hawkmissiles to Iran.   The deal broke down after the first shipment of 18 missilesbecause the Iranians were dissatisfied with the weapons theyreceived.   As a result, ``a substantial windfall was left'' in the accountof Lake Resources, a Panamanian company controlled by Secord,independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said in the filing in U.S.District Court.   ``Aided by this infusion'' of cash, which the 1987 congressionalIran-Contra report estimated was $800,000, ``the enterprise shippeda subststantial quanity of weapons to the Contras'' in December ofthat year, Walsh said.   ``Thus, the events of November afforded North his firstopportunity to exploit arms sales to Iran in order to support theContras; the stage wa set for the diversion of 1986,'' Walsh said.   During his testimony before the House-Senate committee hearingson the Iran-Contra affair, North said the idea of using arms-saleprofits to help the Contras was mentioned by Ghorbanifar duringdiscussions held to set up the February 1986 sale of 1,000 TOWmissiles to Iran.   Recalling the Jan. 22, 1986, meeting in London, North saidGhorbanifar ``suggested several incentives to make that Februarytransaction work, and the attractive incentive for me was ... thatresiduals would flow to support the Nicaraguan resistance.''   Ghorbanifar agreed to pay $10,000 for each of the 1,000 TOWmissiles, which were to be purchased from the Defense Departmentthrough the CIA.   At a meeting in Washington the next day, North _ ``in a criticalmisrepresentation'' _ told two CIA officials and a Pentagon officerthat Secord would pay the CIA $6,000 per missile or $6 million inall _ ``when he well knew that $10 million was the negotiatedprice.''   The CIA eventually set the price at $3,700 per missile _ ``forreasons unrelated to North's statements,'' Walsh said.   In his latest summary of evidence in the case, Walsh saidprosecutors ``will demonstrate at trial that North played asignificant role in directing expenditures from the enterprisethrough witnesses such as Willard Zucker,'' an American lawyer whooperates a Swiss financial company.   North and Secord are charged along with former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim withconspiring to divert more than $14 million in arms-for-hostageprofits to the Contras. Poindexter, Secord and Hakim are to be triedseparately after North.   Walsh's filing was made as U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesellconcluded seven days of closed hearings to consder North'sobjections to censoring sensitive information from 395 prosecutionexhibits.   The independent prosecutor, in a separate filing, suggested aprocedure under which uncensored documents could be shown to jurors,the judge and the witness without revealing the contents tospectators.   The arms deals continued, but by the summer of 1986 ``fissuresbegan to develop in North's scheme'' after the Iranians learned theywere being overcharged as much as 600 percent, apparently when theyobtained a price list for spare parts.   North asked the CIA to generate a phony price list to``extinguish the complaints.''   When confronted by CIA officer Charles Allen with Ghorbanifar'scomplaints, North's reaction ``was to question the trustworthinessof Ghorbanifar.''   ``Thus, North repeatedly failed to disclose the true origin ofthe inflated prices _ his own efforts to generate a surplus for theContras. Instead, he attempted to cover his tracks and blame theproblem on Ghorbanifar,'' Walsh said.   In early October 1986, Allen warned then-CIA Director WilliamCasey and deputy director Robert Gates that he suspected North andSecord were diverting profits to the Contras. Allen also warned that``Ghorbanifar might go public with allegations concerning thepricing of the weapons.''   North was fired from the National Security Council staff andPoindexter resigned in late November 1986 after the diversion wasconfirmed in a memo unearthed by Attorney General Edwin Meese III'sinvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
