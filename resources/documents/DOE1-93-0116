The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), as the vehiclefor this shift, has become the focus of debate over implications of anew strategic policy. This study seeks to examine the strategic relationship,and the role of arms control during a transition from an offensive-dominantstrategy to a defensive-dominant strategy. The methodology for the studyis to present arguments for and against SDI, as they relate to the issuesof stability and arms control, evaluate their validity, draw conclusions,and provide recommendations that may enhance international security duringa transition period of SDI.</TEXT></DOC>
