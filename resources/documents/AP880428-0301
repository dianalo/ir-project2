LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s first-quarterearnings rose 19 percent compared with the year-ago period partlybecause of increased revenues in the transport aircraft operation,the company said Thursday.   McDonnell Douglas earned $51.2 million, or $1.33 per share, onrevenues of $3.24 billion in the first quarter. Earnings in thesame quarter last year were $43 million, or $1.06 per share, onrevenues of $3.03 billion, the company said.   Transport aircraft revenues increased sharply because thecompany delivered 24 MD-80 aircraft in the first quarter of thisyear, compared with earlier rates of 12 planes a year. Combataircraft earnings also increased, but the increase was more thanoffset by the impact of an early retirement program instituted in1987, the company said.   The voluntary early retirement program resulted in a one-time,pre-tax charge of $66 million, or 93 cents a share.   The company said it has invested heavily to deveop the MD-11tri-jet and to compete for the Air Force's advanced tacticalfighter program.   Chairman John F. McDonnell, who reported the earnings at thecompany's annual shareholders meeting, said McDonnell Douglas isconsidering a cooperative agreement with the European aircraftmanufacturer Airbus Industries to develop a family of aircraft thatcould compete successfully with Boeing Co., the current leader inthe commercial aircraft industry.   He described negotiations with Airbus as very preliminary,complicated and delicate, adding that there was ``absolutely noassurance that we will come to an agreement any time soon.''</TEXT></DOC>
