The move will force the utilities to purchase fuel oil as an alternative power supply, but that isn't expected to have a major impact on fuel costs or consumer rates since oil and natural gas prices are close.    Utilities affected by the move include Southern California Edison Co., a unit of SCEcorp, San Diego Gas andamp; Electric Co., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and several municipal utilities in California.    The switch to burning more oil could intensify the level of air pollution in Southern California, a region already choked by smog. Southern California Gas said it will deliver more natural gas if there's a &quot;smog alert,&quot; but said it expects the cutback to last through October.    Southern California Gas said the recent high level of demand for natural gas is due primarily to the drought, which has hurt supplies of hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest and caused utilities to step up their use of natural gas.    A spokesman at San Diego Gas andamp; Electric said the utility expects the price impact of the action to be &quot;negligible,&quot; but said if the cutback extends through October the utility may need to buy an additional tanker of oil at a cost of about $1 million. That, he said, could slow expected consumer rate cuts.    A spokesman at Southern California Edison also said he doesn't expect the action to have a significant impact on the utility's prices or on consumer rates.    Southern California Gas said it currently has 45 billion cubic feet of gas in storage, compared with 58 billion cubic feet at the same time last year. The company said it plans to reduce total deliveries to the utilities to about 800 million cubic feet of natural gas a day, a cut of up to 40% from recent levels.    Southern California Gas said it is the second time in eight months that it has restricted deliveries to major customers due to heavy demand. The company also trimmed deliveries in January due to high demand resulting from cold weather. </TEXT></DOC>
