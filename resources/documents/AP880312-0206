Here is a scorecard ofhis Kremlin stewardship.</TEXT><HEAD>BY JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</HEAD><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three years have been enough for Mikhail S.Gorbachev to shake his nation, break away from economic dogmas ahalf-century old and strike a new kind of arms deal with the UnitedStates.   Yet many of Gorbachev's 284 million compatriots have so far seenfew concrete results from his robust style of leadership.   The reform-minded Communist Party chief, who turned 57 thismonth, says he has just begun to reshape his country andacknowledges the toughest years lie ahead.   ``We have revived throughout the world hope for the future,''Gorbachev said in a Feb. 18 speech. ``We ought to treasure that,and to justify the trust that we feel everywhere.''   Within a week of being named Soviet leader on March 11, 1985,following the death of Konstantin U. Chernenko, Gorbachev calledfor speeding up the country's economic and social development.   There have been stirrings of change, as well as resistance, asbureaucrats are laid off, workers face more demanding standards andthe specter of price hikes looms.   Yet as Gorbachev enters his fourth year in power, the SovietUnion still must import grain to feed itself. Poor housing, amonotonous diet and hours spent waiting in line to buy low-qualitygoods remain the lot of millions.   Gorbachev has set himself an ambitious agenda, one heincreasingly says will take years to enact. Here, in Gorbachev'swords, are the goals he has fixed, and his successes and setbacksto date.      GLASNOST _ ``We must not evade the problems that have arisen ... so let us say it, loud and clear!'' (1986)   Glasnost for Soviets has meant being able to read in their pressabout prostitution, homelessness and other social ills whoseexistence was once denied.   In January, they were told for the first time of a domestic aircrash the same day it occurred.   Glasnost has breathed life into theater, films and art. BorisPasternak's masterpiece ``Doctor Zhivago'' appeared in print thisyear for the first time, and there is franker discussion of thelegacy of dictator Josef Stalin and some of his victims, includingNikolai I. Bukharin, were posthumously rehabilitated.   But, as Russians would say, ``blank spots'' in glasnost persist.A reflex seems to make the Kremlin leadership hesitate beforeissuing bad news, as during the Chernobyl disaster or the ethnicbloodshed in Azerbaijan last month.   Glasnost is not a Soviet-style First Amendment. Unsanctionedpublic gatherings are prohibited. Independent groups are barredfrom having printing presses. Newspapers toe the party line onforeign policy and defense.      LIVING STANDARDS _ ``Plans for the country's social and economicdevelopment envisage raising the people's well-being to aqualitatively new level.'' (1986)   For the Soviet worker, it means people who work well areentitled to earn more. Those who don't can be fired.   Moreover, 16 million people are expected to be laid off by theyear 2000 because of rising labor efficiency and cuts made in thegovernment bureaucracy.   Many Soviets worry the reforms may hurt their buying power.Authorities are studying a price hike to slash the $97 billionspent yearly to subsidize milk, bread and other staples.   Meat and butter are still rationed in some areas, and well-madeshoes and clothing are rare. In winter, onions and potatoes are theonly vegetables in many Moscow food stores.   One family in five lives in communal housing.   The Soviet living standard is still markedly low when comparedto the developed West, and a criticism once made by Nikita S.Khrushchev still seems apt: ``What sort of a communist society isit that has no sausage?''      PERESTROIKA _ ``The economy is a mess ... we have forgotten howto work.'' (1987)   Perestroika, the restructuring and modernization of thestate-run economy, is the linchpin of Gorbachev's program. It runscounter to more than 50 years of central control, when bureaucratsset production levels of everything from safety pins to trucks.   Factory managers are now free to contract freely with otherfirms. Citizens can drive taxis or organize in cooperatives to runa restaurant.   The bottom line, so far, has been inconclusive.   Last year, for the first time in recent memory, the entire risein production was due to greater efficiency, rather than thebuilding of new factories. The gross national product rose by 3.3percent.   However, more than one enterprise in eight lost money. Manyfactories signed contracts, then failed to deliver.   Others delivered, but no one was interested in $2.3 billionworth of goods too shoddy or outmoded to attract buyers.      AGRICULTURE _ ``Comrades, a problem that we will have to solvein the shortest time possible is that of fully supplying ourcountry with food.'' (1986)   A peasant's son and the party's former chief for agriculture,Gorbachev well knows the woes of the Soviet state-run farmingsector, and after eight months in power, he created a``superministry'' to tackle them.   But in 1987, partly because of bad weather, farm output was upby only 1.8 percent over 1986, and harvests of some crops likepotatoes actually declined.   Foreign farmers continue to feed a part of the Sovietpopulation. The 1987 grain crop was the third largest in history,but a drop in the output of good wheat has forced the Soviets toimport large quantities of grain for bread.      SUPERPOWER AND FOREIGN RELATIONS _ ``The Soviet Union isproposing a step-by-step and consistent process of ridding theearth of nuclear weapons ... before the end of this century.''(1986)   Relations with Washington had begun to warm slightly beforeGorbachev took over as Soviet leader. But his tenure has seen arebirth of optimism that reminds some of the detente days of the1970s.   Gorbachev and President Reagan are preparing a fourth summit. InDecember, they signed a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclearmissiles, the first superpower pact outlawing a class of weaponry.Negotiators are working on a treaty that would halve superpowerstrategic arsenals.   Gorbachev has proclaimed his readiness to pull out ofAfghanistan, ending an eight-year Soviet military occupation thathas damaged Kremlin prestige, cost billions of rubles and claimedthe lives of an estimated 10,000 Soviet soldiers.   He has given East bloc nations more latitude to set their owndomestic courses, and courted Asian countries and America's alliesin Europe. But irritants like concerns over Soviet human rightsviolations remain.   In February, he told a visitor: ``Western Europe is not ready sofar to understand us the way we really are. People there continueto be afraid of the Soviet Union. This is deep-rooted.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, March 14</NOTE></DOC>
