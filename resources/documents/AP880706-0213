Those television images of bloated bodies floating in thePersian Gulf fuel speculation but no answers.   On television, the bodies appeared to be nude and to be sobloated as to suggest they were in the water for some time. Howcome?   How did the Iranians have a television camera in place tocapture what Iranian televisision said were shots of the plane atthe moment it was hit? (To the viewer, the plane was a mere dot onthe screen and the pictures were too grainy to lead to thatconclusion.)   No American official has publicly suggested that Iran'srevolutionary government deliberately sent civilians on Iran Airflight 655 to their death, but terrorism expert Robert Kuppermansaid he had heard ``a few people in the Pentagon'' advance suchtheories.   ``I don't give much credence to it personally,'' said Kupperman,a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies, a think tank. ``I don't believe that anybody is going tobe able to prove that this has been a set-up.''   Neil C. Livingstone, a conservative expert on terrorism, saidthere are ``some real strange questions'' about the incident,citing television footage provided by the Iranians.   ``It's very hard to explain why someone would be taking picturesof a plane flying in the gulf,'' Livingstone said.   Dr. Charles Ruehle, the former commander of the Armed ForcesInstitute of Medical Pathology, said finding floating, bloatedbodies within a short time would not be unusual after a crash intowarm, salty water.   The gulf's sea surface temperature averages about 89 degressFahrenheit and the salinity is higher than in the Atlantic Oceanoff the Florida coast.   Ruehle said he was puzzled by why the bodies appeared to benude. ``In my experience, there has been nothing that would explainthat,'' he said.   The experts, however, all said there is not enough availableinformation to evaluate exactly what happened.   Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor and a NationalSecurity Council aide under President Carter, said he began to hearpeople suggest ``within hours'' of Sunday's attack that the Airbushad taunted the Navy warship Vincennes on purpose.   ``It is an easy explanation that takes the United States off thehook for having shot the plane down,'' Sick said. At present, theevidence does not justify that conclusion, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
