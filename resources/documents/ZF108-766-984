 &quot;InformationAge: People, Information, and Technology&quot; is the first exhibit of its kind,not only incorporating more than 700 artifacts relating to the disseminationand use of information in the last 150 years, but also interacting withvisitors to give them a unique perspective on how information affects theirlives.andM;The exhibit includes the telegraph invented by Samuel Morse and the wirelessradio invented by Guglielmo Marconi.andP;  Visitors can look at components fromthe telephone Alexander Graham Bell used to transmit his historic message.andO;And they can see a piece of the first transatlantic telephone cable.andP;  Theorigins of computing are represented by the first computer, the UNIVAC, builtin the 1960s.andP;  The exhibit also has a model of the four-story Semi-AutomaticGround Environment (SAGE) system, which was used for electronic airsurveillance during the cold war era.andM;The $10-million permanent exhibit is driven by a network that spans 14,000square feet.andP;  By the time the system integrator, Electronic Data Systems(EDS) from Plano, Texas, became involved with the project, the exhibitiondesigners knew they wanted extensive interactive components to complement theartifacts and graphics.andP;  As a result EDS designed a congruous system,connected to and managed from a single system.andP;  The interactive elementsextend to the network that drives the exhibition itself so that visitors canbe network managers as well as network users.andM;An Interactive ExhibitandM;There are three primary layers of interaction between the visitor and theSmithsonian exhibit.andP;  The first layer, not initiated by the visitor, controlsthe environmental audio/video material.andP;  At 18 different stations throughoutthe exhibit, there are Pioneer LDV 8000 video disc players, displayingcontinuously looping films.andP;  Within the exhibit space, there are both ambientnoise level and people sensors.andP;  The lighting and sound level can be adjustedin any zone, given the number of people present, as detected by the sensors.andM;The second layer of interaction involves audio/video displays that may beselected by the visitors.andP;  Using an infrared touch panel embedded inPlexiglas at a standalone monitor, visitors can select video material at sixdifferent locations in the exhibit.andP;  At each of the six stations, users canchoose to view one of four video segments about the Information Age.andM;The video, which is shown on a 26-inch Pioneer monitor, can be presented withor without captions for the hearing-impaired, depending on the visitor'sselection.andP;  The display defaults to a displayed caption, with an icon at thebottom that lets visitors remove the captions if they find them distracting.andO;&quot;This is the first exhibition to accommodate hearing-impaired people,&quot; notesLarry Lozon, EDS' technical project manager for the exhibition.andM;The touch panel communicates information about which video a user wants tosee, as well as the caption choice, over a serial link to a PS/2, which thenrelays that information to the video disc player.andP;  At the same time,information about the transaction travels across a Token Ring network and isused to update the Oracle OS/2 data-base server.andP;  The curators can then viewthis information to see which videos are popular and which are not and tailorthe exhibition accordingly.andM;Getting People InvolvedandM;The third interactive element involves users the most.andP;  The exhibitbrochures, which contain a guide and map of the exhibition, are each printedwith a unique bar code.andP;  EDS estimates 100 million unique brochures will beprinted during the exhibit's lifetime.andP;  In addition to guiding the visitors,the brochures allow the curators to gather information about visitors andgauge the popularity of various stations.andM;The visitors first encounter the brochures when they enter the exhibit.andP;  Theycan pick up one at any of five entry stations around a carousel that displayshumorous lifelike figures of people in the Information Age.andP;  Visitors passthe bar code over a reader similar to that in supermarkets and receive aresponse on the adjoining LED display, which welcomes them to the InformationAge show and thanks them for joining the exhibition's network.andP;  The show'scurators can also preconfigure certain bar codes in the database for specificmessages to welcome special tour groups.andP;  When a visitor passes or &quot;wands&quot;the brochure over a reader at the registration station, the bar code numberis appended to a database, along with the date and time that the number wasentered.andM;The visitor next uses the brochure at an interactive touch screen stationthat describes the 1890 census process.andP;  One hundred years ago, the Hollerithmachine used punchcards to record vital data about people living in America.andO;Visitors activate the interactive station by wanding the bar code over areader.andP;  The station prompts visitors for information about their age group,gender, and the area of the country from which they hail.andP;  The data is thencompared to actual 1890 census data, and visitors receive a profile, orfortune, of who they would have been had they lived in 1890.andP;  A suburbanteen-age male from Kansas in 1990, for example, would translate into a youthliving on a farm in 1890.andP;  While the system is returning this information tothe visitor, the network also attaches the personal information to theindividual's bar code number.andM;The next interactive exhibit simulates the encoding and decoding of secretmessages during World War II.andP;  The visitor enters his or her first namethrough the interactive panel, and the network appends the information to thedatabase and encodes it with the German Enigma system used by the Axis duringthe war.andP;  Visitors can then decode it using the American Bombe machine, whichwas a device actually used to decode Enigma machines during the war.andP;  TheBombe machine displayed in the exhibition is the sole survivor of more than100 similar machines that were destroyed after the war.andP;  This is the firsttime that it has been available to the public.andM;The third interactive station is encountered in the postwar section of theexhibit, circa 1960.andP;  Positioned against a screen of the first Kennedy-Nixondebate, the station educates visitors about the impact of television andcomputers on politics.andP;  It asks visitors to respond to three questions askinghow they feel about television and politics.andP;  The information is also storedin the Oracle database.andM;The first three interactive exhibits are nonthreatening and purelyinformative.andP;  The fourth, however, makes visitors aware of the fact that asthey study the exhibit, the exhibit studies them.andP;  The station is situated ina section that features the National Crime Identification Center (NCIC), abranch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation established in 1967.andP;  Visitorslearn about the NCIC's computerized, nationwide database of information aboutcriminals, including their fingerprints, that was responsible for the captureof Martin Luther King Jr.'s killer, James Earl Ray.andM;At this station, visitors can scan their own fingerprints into the networkfor analysis.andP;  The fingerprint is then stored on a separate image file thatis indexed by the database, but not actually appended to it.andP;  &quot;The ideabehind this interactive [exhibit] was to challenge people's comfort level, tosee if they would really want their fingerprints to be recorded,&quot; says Lozon.andO;&quot;We were surprised.andP;  People just line up for this interactive.&quot;andP;  Signs assurevisitors that their fingerprints will not be permanently recorded in anydatabase.andP;  The fingerprints are either erased when users receive a finalprintout of their activities, or, if they fail to pick up the printout, theprints are purged at the end of the day.andP;  Nevertheless, if you are on theFBI's 10 Most Wanted List and you want to remain at large, you should thinktwice about participating in this exhibit.andM;Three interactive exhibits toward the end of the historical part of theexhibition let visitors experienced various network control situations.andP;  Theycan simulate the activities of a 911 operator responding to incomingemergency calls, a currency trader monitoring news events to decide whichcurrencies to buy and sell, or a television news producer mixing satellitefeeds from the Beijing uprising.andM;The Gallery of NetworksandM;When visitors finally enter the interactive gallery, they can experiment withseveral interactive machines, including one that lets them design a bicycle.andO;They can also critique the exhibition by using a gestural interface machinedesigned by IBM.andP;  Armed with a lifht pen and a map that breaks the exhibitinto ten sections, visitors can check areas they liked, cross out areas theydidn't like, and circle those areas they would like to explore in moredetails.andP;  This information is fed into a database, and it allows the curatorsto tailor the exhibit to the attendees' interests.andM;The three DEC VAXstations in the interactive gallery also allow visitors tosee how the network that controls the exhibit operates.andP;  The exhibit isbroken down into geometric shapes representing the audiovisual loops andvarious visitor stations.andP;  By touching their finger to a certain object iconon the screen, the visitor can check its status.andP;  The display stationprovides, information on the last update from the station, the number ofvisitors who have used it that day, and whether or not the device isexperiencing any problems.andP;  In fact, any objects in a state of failure aredisplayed in warning colors, so visitors can select a malfunctioning stationand see exactly what went wrong.andM;The visitors see precisely the same network display that the network monitorsin the control room see.andP;  EDS used the same proprietary network managementsystem that it implements in its own private network, which is among thelargest in the world.andP;  EDS technicians can actually monitor the Smithsoniannetwork in Washington, D.C., from its headquarters in Texas.andM;The system can monitor every element of the network, right down to theperipherals.andP;  For example, if a video disc player malfunctioned, the problemwould be reported to its associated PS/2.andP;  The PS/2 would then report thecondition across a Token Ring-to-Ethernet bridge, and it would register onthe network map display of the VAXstation.andP;  The information is also reportedto the Oracle database and can be used to determine which stations, if any,are especially faulty.andP;  All stations report their status to the system onceevery 30 seconds.andM;After this final interactive gallery, visitors line up at one of two Xeroxlaser printers to receive their final printout, which chronicles theiractivities at each interactive station.andP;  It provides information on when theyjoined the network and when they left it, feedback from the 1890 censues,their first name, a printout of their fingerprint, and details theirexperiences at the network control stations.andP;  If, at the comment station, thevisitor asks for more information on a certain are of the exhibit, theprintout will incude a customized bibliography of relevant references.andM;The computer network also controls two theaters within the exhibit.andP;  Thefirst theater, right before the WWII section, features a six-minute newsreelto introduce the section.andP;  Sensors activate the opening and closing of thedoors, adjust the light level, and activate the video--a single imageprojected onto a screen.andM;The second theater, which visitors enter after leaving the main exhibit,incorporates the same passive environmental controls as the first, butrequires a more sophisticated media control.andP;  Instead of a single screen,visitors watch a 42-inch video wall, comprised of 12 Pioneer monitorsattached to 12 video players.andP;  The network synchronizes the 12 disc playersof this multimedia screen.andM;Behind the ScenesandM;The exhibit was designed by Rogow andamp; Bernstein, a design firm based in LosAngeles.andP;  A number of corporate sponsors provided funding, either in the formof money or products and services donated, including IBM, the seven RegionalBell Operating Companies (RBCOCs), Unisys, Northern Telecom, Xerox, DEC,Hewlett-Packard, ATandamp;T, NCR, Intel, Texas Instruments, Tandem Computers,Computerworld, Reuters, Apple Computer, Ungermann-Bass, Oracle, and PioneerElectronics.andP;  EDS donated their services for the installation and willcontinue to administrative the network.andM;The primary network driving the exhibit is an IBM Token Ring; however, amixture of computing devices was required.andP;  The VAXstations in the finalinteractive gallery are connected on a DECnet network, and the two arebridged together using the Ungermann-Bass Access/One 802.5Ethernet-to-EThernet Bridge.andP;  Data is collected from the machines on theToken Ring side and is used to update the live view of the network displayedon the VAXstation screens.andM;The Token Rig is mostly contained in five rack-mounted units in the controlroom.andP;  The units contain PS/2s and some Unisys 25MHz 386 computers, one ofwhich acts as the file server.andP;  Some stations are actually on the exhibitfloor, where the touch screen of an interactive module must be connected to aprocessor.andP;  Within any given rack, six machines are slaved to one computercontroller.andM;The information gathered through the bar-coded brochures and interactivestations is stored in an Oracle for OS/2 database.andP;  Other workstations on theToken Ring run DOS.andP;  EDS uses NetWare to control all the file transfer andprint services on the Token Ring.andM;The system design has three levels of redundancy.andP;  The file server ismirrored to a backup server, which must be brought online manually if theprimary server fails.andP;  If the network fails for any reason, all the stationscan switch to local control.andP;  For example, all the information collectedthrough the bar code wouldd be stored on the local workstation and passed onto the database when the network was repaired.andP;  During a serious networkproblem, the printer would also default to a generic, nonpersonalizedprintout.andM;Lozon says EDS has been pleased with the reliability of the network so farand went through an extensive testing process to ensure its no-faultoperation.andP;  It only takes two people to do floor monitoring and systemadministration.andM;EDS runs nightly backups of all the information gathered in a day, except ofcourse, the visitors' fingerprints.andP;  Despite the total volume of informationthat the exhibit will gather during its run, there is no need to keepinformation on visitors on line for more than a day.andP;  The database doesretain a total count of the number of visitors that have passed through theshow.andP;  The daily visitor count, as well as the visitor count to date, areflashed on a large LED display along with timing information for the theaterpresentations.andM;Affected by the AgeandM;Technology has obviously molded events of the past century, but for the firsttime a major museum has devoted an entire exhibit to the way American lifehas been shaped by information.andP;  The Smithsonian exhibit approaches itssubject in a unique way, interactively involving the visitors to underscorethe impact information has on everyone.andP;  And a network is an integral part ofshowing the effects.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
