The furnace was of a design amenable to extensive automation.Its most important characteristics in terms of production and fuel efficiencywere determined by an extensive study of its mode of operation and comparedwith the values of an existing tunnel kiln. It was found that in termsof output capacity the roller furnace investigated cannot replace thetunnel kiln. However, thanks to its flexibility and largely automaticoperation it can be successfully employed to reduce energy consumptionan labour costs and to respond rapidly to changing market requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
