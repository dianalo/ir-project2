The pressures of unrest and sanctions are waning, whiteofficials say, and there is time to crack down on pockets ofopposition while trying to persuade blacks to accept less thanmajority rule.   In the week since the 1988 Parliament session opened, PresidentP.W. Botha and his Cabinet have sought to turn the spotlight awayfrom black grievances and focus it on a new economic program thatadvocates a public-sector wage freeze and privatization of statemonopolies.   During a string of speeches by Cabinet ministers, scant mentionwas made of the persistent grass-roots struggle by blacks forpolitical rights.   Instead, there were generalized endorsements of democracycoupled with explanations that it could be extended to blacks onlyin a slow, circumscribed manner that would leave whites with afinal say on national policy.   ``Reform cannot take place at the same rate as one can brewinstant coffee,'' said Stoffel van der Merwe, a deputy ministerassigned by Botha to woo black leaders into negotiations. ``Thecapacity for people to digest change is limited.''   Compared with the hardline apartheid rhetoric of a decade ago,the current talk of sharing power with blacks borders on therevolutionary.   But the government also has clarified its non-negotiable bottomline _ continuation of segregated schools, hospitals and livingareas, and a political system in which whites could never bedominated by blacks.   The nation's blacks number 26 million and their populationgrowth rate is nearly triple that of the 5 million whites.   ``The (political) model we will develop is not intended to seekthe approval of the outside world,'' said one government official,speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We can't have a politicaldispensation based simply on majority rule.''   Anti-apartheid activists already have dismissed as inadequateone of the few pending pieces of reform legislation _ a proposal toallow communities the option of integrating, subject to approval byresidents and the government.   Most of the official talk about reform is now presented in termsof the new economic program, which proponents say will free largesums of capital for projects benefiting blacks.   ``Reform Costs Money'' has become an unofficial governmentslogan, with the implication that economic progress must precede amajor political shift.   Botha, in full-page newspaper advertisements Sunday, called onSouth Africans to ``tighten our belts'' to build the economicfoundation for social and political change.   But Sampie Terreblanche, a leading economist who last year quitBotha's National Party, suggested in a column in the nationallycirculated Sunday Times that the economy was being stressed ``todetract attention from the tragic failure of the government'spolitical reform.''   Extreme-right politicians have condemned the economic plan as adisguised attempt to redistribute wealth from whites to blacks.   The government's new approach contrasts with periods in the pastthree years when at least some officials indicated dramaticpolitical moves were imminent.   There were suggestions that Nelson Mandela, jailed leader of theAfrican National Congress, might be freed and that the governmentmight negotiate with the outlawed guerrilla movement.   Particularly embarrassing was Botha's highly promoted 1985speech in which he said South Africa was ``crossing the Rubicon''away from apartheid, then disappointed people who expectedspecific, momentous concessions.   Now government officials believe the ANC's military strength iswaning and claim to have triumphed over the international sanctionscampaign.   The white liberal opposition is in disarray and anti-governmentunrest in black townships is down sharply after 20 months ofstate-of-emergency detentions and security force patrols.   There is breathing space, the government believes, toconcentrate on long-term plans and confront the challenge by theextreme-right Conservative Party in three upcoming parliamentaryby-elections.   Gerrit Viljoen, minister for black education and development,told foreign journalists that the best way to counter the far-rightthreat is to promote orderly, effective reform.   But the government also is preparing an array of tough movesagainst its political foes on the left _ moves which could boostits standing on the right. The targets include:   _ Militant black trade unions. Pending legislation would make itharder for unions to stage legal strikes and easier for employersto fire strikers.   _ Universities. State subsidies are being sharply reduced thisyear, and further cuts are threatened unless university officialscrack down on anti-government campus protests.   _ The press. Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha defendedregulations that have subjected anti-government newspapers tothreat of closure, and he criticized mainstream English-languagepapers for a ``venomous vendetta'' against his censorship rules.   _ Anti-apartheid organizations. Officials indicate thatlegislation is being drafted that would prohibit the receipt offoreign funds by certain anti-government groups, a move that coulddevastate those whose supporters within South Africa are mostlypoor.   ``If one gets large amounts of money which is channeled fromoverseas into the South African political process, then one getstoo many foreign shareholders,'' said van der Merwe. ``If peoplewant to be active on the South African political front, they mustdo so with money they raise in South Africa.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   David Crary, news editor for The AssociatedPress in Johannesburg, has been reporting from Africa since 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
