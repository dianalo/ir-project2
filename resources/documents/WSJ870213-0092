One of the banks closed yesterday, First City Bank of Atoka, Atoka, Okla., is to reopen today as a branch of another institution. The FDIC decided to pay off the insured depositors of a second bank, Federated National Bank, Live Oak, Texas, because no bids were received for its purchase. Agency officials were working last night to resolve the status of the third bank, Security National Bank, Midland, Texas.    The only office of First City, closed by state banking authorities, is to become a branch of Atoka State Bank, also in Atoka. First City had assets of $12.7 million and held deposits of $12.4 million in 3,100 accounts.    The FDIC expects to begin paying off the insured deposits of Federated National, closed by the Comptroller of the Currency, tomorrow. The failed bank had assets of $13.4 million and held $11.4 million in 1,400 deposit accounts, including $127,000 in five accounts that exceed the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    Holders of those deposits will share with the FDIC proportionately in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets.    Security National, closed by the Comptroller, had assets of $7.8 million and held deposits of $7.7 million in 2,000 accounts. </TEXT></DOC>
