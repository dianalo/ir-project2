The ministers open their meeting here today alreadyconvinced they need to move quickly to prop up falling oilprices. But they are far apart on how much the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries should reduce production andon how to divide the cuts.</LP><TEXT>   In a surprise development, Celestino Armas, the Venezuelanoil minister who is generally considered a pricing moderate,called for the biggest reductions on his arrival yesterday.He predicted that demand for OPEC's oil in the second quarterwill be less than 22 million barrels a day. That wouldsuggest that OPEC would have to trim more than two millionbarrels a day from current levels of output -- estimated torange between 24 million and 24.4 million barrels a day -- tofirm up prices.   OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, however, sees second-quarterdemand at more than 23 million barrels a day. Although thekingdom seems willing to cut its own production, whichrecently has been as high as 8.5 million barrels a day, itwants OPEC to use a new production formula that wouldallocate quotas on the basis of production capacity. Andsources close to the Saudis said the kingdom now is capableof producing nine million barrels a day.   &quot;This is going to be a difficult meeting,&quot; said GinandjarKartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister. Mr. Ginandjarrecommends OPEC should reduce total output to 23 million orless.   OPEC's own economic experts will report to the oilministers today that demand for their oil should averageslightly under 22.8 million barrels a day for the secondquarter. Several of the ministers suggested similarexpectations on their arrivals.   According to Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister andOPEC's president, that could translate into production cutsof one to two million barrels a day. That is in line withseveral other suggestions of 5% to 7% reductions.   Oil experts outside OPEC also generally insist thatsubstantial production cuts are necessary to keep oil pricesfrom falling further as demand slackens seasonally in thespring. Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp., who is herebecause of the OPEC meeting, said that if the exporters don'tcut production sharply, &quot;the market will collapse in 60days.&quot; But he said a second-quarter output level of 22.5million barrels a day would result in a price rise.   Yesterday in U.S. futures trading, crude oil for Marchdelivery fell 50 cents a barrel to $19.28.   It already is agreed that Kuwait and Iraq, both sidelinedby the Persian Gulf crisis, will be excluded from anyreduction requirements. Iraq, of course, still is banned fromexporting its oil by the United Nations sanctions. ButKuwait's output continues to recover and will reach at least800,000 barrels a day by the end of the second quarter,Kuwaiti delegates said.   OPEC last operated under an official quota system in July1990, the month before Iraq invaded Kuwait. That system wasbased on an old formula that had been in place for years.Leading producers such as Saudi Arabia want the new formulato be based on current production capacities. &quot;It's a matterof trying to compromise,&quot; said Indonesia's Mr. Ginandjar.   In fact, the Saudis appear to be rejecting any attempt tomeld historical quotas and current production capacities.&quot;There's no way to go back to the old numbers,&quot; said one Gulfsource. &quot;The July 1990 quota system is neither the Bible northe Koran.&quot;   Iran, normally a pricing opponent of Saudi Arabia, may bealready attempting to arrange such a compromise. Althoughneither Saudi nor Iranian delegates wished to discuss it,OPEC sources confirmed that Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranianminister, flew to Saudi Arabia to meet with Hisham Nazer, theSaudi minister, and with King Fahd over the weekend. &quot;Thediscussions were fruitful,&quot; one OPEC delegate confirmed.</TEXT></DOC>
