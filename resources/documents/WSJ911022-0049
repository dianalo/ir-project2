The NIH move involves filing patent applications onfragments of DNA that were copied from the DNA in a humanbrain cell but are of unknown purpose. DNA, ordeoxyribonucleic acid, is the substance of which the genesare made.</LP><TEXT>   An NIH scientist is taking these DNA fragments anddetermining the sequence of short stretches of molecules thatmake up each fragment. The NIH patent office is then filing apatent application on each fragment that the scientist hassequenced.   The NIH filed a patent application in June covering 350 ofthe DNA fragments, and agency patent officials currently arepreparing an application covering 2,000 more DNA fragments.The first NIH application attracted little notice outside thefield of gene researchers until last week, when thescientific journals Nature and Science carried reports on themove.   Heretofore, companies and scientists who have isolatedgenes have received patents on the use of those genes to makeproteins with specific uses in drugs or industrial processes.What differs in the NIH patent applications, and whatdisconcerts biotechnology companies, is that many of the DNAfragments are obviously copies of genes or parts of genes,but neither the NIH scientist nor anyone else knows what thegenes are supposed to do. Hence, the NIH in effect is tryingto patent genes whose functions are unknown.   NIH officials say they are seeking to help the industryexploit the unprecedented flow of genetic discoveries comingfrom the effort to identify all 50,000 to 100,000 humangenes. The officials argue that publishing the discoverieswithout any patent protection would take away any incentivecompanies might have to exploit the discoveries forpharmaceuticals and other industrial and medical uses.   If the NIH obtained the patents it could offerbiotechnology exclusive rights to use of the patented DNAsequences.   However, patent attorneys and research executives atseveral biotechnology companies said they doubt the NIH willbe successful in obtaining the patents.   &quot;I think the U.S. Patent Office will reject theseapplications for failing to meet the utility requirement,&quot;said Scott Hallquist, general counsel for Immunex Corp. inSeattle.   &quot;To be patentable, the discovery has to have a defineduse, and from what I can see the NIH people just don't meetthat threshold,&quot; said John P. White, a patent attorneyspecializing in biotechnology at the Cooper andamp; Dunham law firmin New York.   And the companies aren't buying the federal medicalresearch agency's argument that it has the industry's bestinterests at heart.   Obtaining the patents would &quot;act as a disincentive to makeinvestments in biotechnology,&quot; said Alan Smith, senior vicepresident for research at Genzyme Corp., a Cambridge, Mass.,biotechnology company. &quot;What if we discovered a gene withincredibly useful activity, then sequenced the DNA and foundthat the NIH had already patented it? Where does that leaveus after years of work,&quot; Dr. Smith asked.   Moreover, the companies, most of which are fairly smalland funded by venture capital, could find themselves in anexpensive technology free-for-all if the NIH should obtainthe patents. &quot;If it sticks, then we'll have to do likewise&quot;in filing for patents on newfound fragments of DNA before thefunctions of the fragments' genes are known, said Immunex'sMr. Hallquist.   &quot;Unfortunately, if this became the way of the world . . .we certainly would have to follow suit,&quot; said Stephen Raines,vice president of intellectual property at Genentech Inc. inSouth San Francisco.   Biotechnology companies might have to mass-produce patentapplications, suggested Bruce Eisen, chief patent counsel atGenetics Institute Inc. in Boston. New automated techniquescan determine the molecular sequences of scores of DNAfragments a day. At $1,000 for each patent application, somecompanies could go broke if they didn't limit theirapplications to fragments they suspect might be useful, hesaid. But guessing which DNA fragments might be useful &quot;wouldbe a roulette,&quot; Mr. Eisen said.   &quot;We're already faced with a glut of patent applications,&quot;said Genentech's Mr. Raines. &quot;This would make it much worse.&quot;   What the agency is seeking to patent are &quot;edited&quot; copiesof what are probably genes or fragments of genes found inhuman cells. A gene is a piece of DNA that serves as ablueprint for the making of a protein.   The fragments of DNA that the NIH is attempting to patentare known as complementary DNA fragments or cDNA fragments.Such cDNA fragments can be produced without necessarilyknowing what genes the fragments contain, what proteins thegenes make or what the proteins are supposed to do.   The first step to finding what genes are copied in thecDNA fragments is to determine the sequence of the moleculesthat make up the fragment. It is this step that is being madeby NIH scientist Craig Venter at the National Institute forNeurological Disorders and Strokes.   Dr. Venter is determining the sequence of 50 to 150 cDNAfragments a day. &quot;The majority of the genes we're finding arebrand new genes,&quot; Dr. Venter said.   Only a short portion of the molecular sequence of thesepresumed genes is determined. It is these short sequences theNIH is attempting to patent. The full molecular sequence ofeach gene, the protein that the gene makes and the purpose ofthe protein remain unknown.   &quot;We were concerned because publishing the partialsequences without patenting them might make it difficult topatent the genes or their expression products,&quot; said ReidAdler, head of the NIH's Office of Technology Transfer. &quot;Sowe filed the application in an attempt to secure a patentincentive that might lead companies to try to developproducts based on these sequences as early as possible.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
