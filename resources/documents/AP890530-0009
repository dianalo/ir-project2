Ordered by Congress to take several steps to improve railsafety, the Federal Railroad Administration already has extendedits authority over individual railroad employees, increased finesfor safety violations, required more testing and certification oftrain control equipment, mandated automatic train controls on somelines and imposed tough punishment for tampering with safetydevices.   Most of the actions arise from the Railroad Safety ImprovementAct of 1988, which was prompted largely by the Jan. 4, 1987,collision between an Amtrak train and three Conrail freightlocomotives at Chase, Md., that killed 16 people and hurt 175others.   Conrail engineer Ricky Gates, who has become a symbol for manyof the industry's problems, is serving a five-year prison term formanslaughter after admitting he smoked marijuana shortly before thecrash and violated several safety procedures.   Congress is working on mandatory drug-testing bills for railroademployees, and the Supreme Court in March upheld post-accidenttesting. An administration order requiring random drug testing isbeing challenged in the courts.   Still to come from the railroad administration are several otherrules related to safety. The most controversial are a nationallicensing program for engineers and plans to impose federalstandards for rail-highway crossing signals.   Federal safety officials reported last week that rail crossingfatalities increased 10 percent last year to 689, while otherhighway accidents went up less than 1 percent from 1987. Otherrail-related fatalities decreased from 616 to 564.   The Association of American Railroads opposes new standards forrail crossings, saying only one of 2,857 crossing accidents lastyear was due to a faulty signal.   Licensing, required in the 1988 law, has caused concern in theindustry, partly because the railroad administration has given nohint of what it might include or how it could affect 78,000engineers and other train crew members on the nation's nearly 500railroads.   The Coast Guard licenses ships' captains. Anyone who flies hasto be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. Andeveryone from a commercial truck driver to a kid with a moped needsa state driver's license.   But railroads always have been allowed to set their ownstandards for training and hiring, and they like it that way.   ``We're terribly, terribly interested, and the FRA has beenvery, very closed-mouthed about this issue,'' said Jack Buckingham,safety director for the American Association of Railroads, whichsays the nation's railroads have adequate standards for engineers.   FRA officials said the government's licensing plans will not bedisclosed until the rule is issued early next month. It will notbecome law until after a comment period and public hearing.   The rail safety act requires the agency to set minimum trainingstandards and to consider an applicant's automobile driving recordin issuing an engineer's license. Drunken driving convictionswithin the past five years could lead to denial of an engineer'slicense unless the applicant had completed a rehabilitation program.   Buckingham said railroads follow fairly uniform standards forhiring and training engineers and any federal licensing programshould be based on existing programs run by the largest railroads.   Chicago Northwestern, which has about 950 engineers, will startto train its 100th class this week, said spokesman Fred Bloedorn.He said the five-week course includes classroom instruction onoperating rules, safety and equipment, followed by work in alocomotive simulator.   Burlington Northern has a simulator in Chicago that spokesmanMike Wenninger said can make an inexperienced rider sick from themotion. A trainee can feel the jolt of cars taking up the slack asbrakes are applied, and a movie screen shows actual track therailroad uses, he said.   Conrail, with 9,000 train and engine employees, makes 700,000spot checks annually to ensure the railroad is run safely andrequires its employees to take a class on operating procedures andpass a written exam each year, according to spokesman DonHolloschutz.   Tom Watts, a Union Pacific vice president, said he is concernedthat the licensing requirements meet the needs of an industry whererail conditions vary. Much of engineers' training involves gettingto know the track they will ride, he said.   ``We don't take a guy off the street and make him a mountainengineer,'' Watts said.</TEXT></DOC>
