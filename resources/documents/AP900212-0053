I stand here before younot as a prophet, but as a humble servant of you, the people. Yourtireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to behere today. I therefore place the remaining years of my life inyour hands.   On this day of my release, I extend my sincere and warmestgratitude to the millions of my compatriots and those in everycorner of the globe who have campaigned tirelessly for my release.I extend special greetings to the people of Cape Town, the city towhich, which has been my home for three decades. Your massmarchesand other forms of struggle have served as a constant sourceof strength to all political prisoners.   I salute the African National Congress. It has fulfilled ourevery expectation in its role as leader of the great march tofreedom.   I salute our president, Comrade Oliver Tambo for leading the ANCeven under the most difficult circumstances.   I salute the rank and file members of the ANC: You havesacrificed life and limb in the pursuit of the noble cause of ourstruggle.   I salute combatants of Umkhonto We Sizwe (the ANC's militarywing) ... who paid the ultimate price for the freedom of all SouthAfricans.   I salute the South African Communist Party for its sterlingcontribution to the struggle for democracy: You have survived 40years of unrelenting persecution. The memory of great Communistslike ... Bram Fisher and Moses Mabhida will be cherished forgenerations to come.   I salute General-Secretary Joe Slovo, one of our finestpatriots. We are heartened by the fact that the alliance betweenourselves and the partyremains as strong as it always was.   I salute the United Democratic Front, the National EducationCrisis Committee, the South African Youth Congress, the Transvaaland NatalIndian Congresses, and COSATU, and the many otherformations of the mass democratic movement.   I also salute the Black Sash, and the National Union of SouthAfrican Students. We note with pride that you have endured as theconscience of white South Africans, even during the darkest days ofthe history of our struggle: you held the flag of liberty high. Thelarge-scale mass mobilization of the past few years is one of thekey factors which led to the opening of the final chapter of ourstruggle.   I extend my greetings to the working class of our country, yourorganized strength is the pride of our movement: You remain themost dependable force in the struggle to end exploitation andoppression.

I pay tribute to the mothersand wives and sisters of our nation:you are the rock-hard foundation of our struggle. Apartheid hasinflicted more pain on you than on anyone else.   On this occasion, we thank the world, we thank the worldcommunity for their great contribution to the anti-apartheidstruggle. Without your support, our struggle would not have reachedthis advanced stage.   The sacrifice of the Front Line states will be remembered bySouth Africans forever.   My celebrations will be incomplete without expressing my deepappreciation for the strength that's been given to me during mylong and gloomy years in prison by my beloved wife and family. I amconvinced that your pain and suffering was far greater than my own.   Before I go any further, I wish to make the point that I intendmaking only a few preliminary comments at this stage. I will make amore complete statement only after I have had the opportunity toconsult with my comrades.   Today, the majority of South Africans, black and white,recognize that apartheid has no future. It has to be ended by ourown decisive mass action in order to build peace and security.   The mass campaigns of defiance and other actions of ourorganizations and people can only culminate in the establishment ofdemocracy.   The apartheid's destruction on our subcontinent is incalculable.The fabric of family life of millions of my people has beenshattered. Millions are homeless and unemployed. Our economy liesin ruins and our people are embroiled in political strife.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
