This regulatory change is necessary toinform petitioners that they must now meet the residence rather than thephysical presence criteria in order to be eligible to file a Form I-130abroad. In emergent or humanitarian cases, however, the Service and theU.S. consulates abroad may continue to use their discretionary authorityto accept relative petitions submitted by non-residents. By providing clearand consistent procedures, INS will be better able to process certain immigrantvisa petitions abroad.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Written comments must be received on or before March 23,1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS</T2>: Please submit written comments in triplicate to the Director,Policy Directives and Instructions, Immigration and Naturalization Service,Room 2011, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Yolanda Sanchez-K.

This regulation has resulted in an inconsistentpractice, and thus in confusion for would-be petitioners, since regulationsrequiring foreign residence of the petitioner have remained in effect incases where petitions are filed with overseas INS offices.Since U.S. consulates by regulation are currently permitted to accept andadjudicate visa petitions from petitioners temporarily sojourning abroad,and INS offices are not, a number of petitioners who reside in the UnitedStates have travelled abroad believing they could file petitions for beneficiariesresiding in countries where INS offices are present, only to be instructedto return to a stateside Service office to file because they do not meetthe residence criteria for acceptance by the overseas Service office. Othershave deliberately travelled to countries where petitions may be approvedby U.S. consulates, simply to avoid real or perceived longer waiting timesat stateside INS offices. This has caused heavy and unpredictable workloadsat U.S. consulates around the world.INS has determined that a consistent policy is important, and that it isappropritae and in compliance with the Attorney General's statutory authorityto accept and process relative visa petitions abroad only when the petitioneris a resident of the country over which the U.S. consulate or INS officehas jurisdiction, unless an emergent or humanitarian circumstance exists.Residence, under this section, is defined as the principal, actual dwellingplace (See 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(33)). Temporary residence or visits abroaddo not fulfill the residence requirement under this definition and, therefore,do not qualify petitioners to apply for jurisdictional acceptance by overseasINS offices or U.S. consulates for the processing of their Form I-130 abroad.These revisions clarify for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,the U.S. consulates abroad, and the public the process for filing and acceptingrelative petitions overseas.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigrationand Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a signifcantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This is not a major rulewithin the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does this rule havefederalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federal Assessmentin accordance with E.O. 12612.The information collection requisites contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act under control number andplusmin;1115-0054.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 204</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, Chapter I of Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 204_PETITION TO CLASSIFY ALIEN AS IMMEDIATE RELATIVE OF A UNITEDSTATES CITIZEN OR AS A PREFERENCE IMMIGRANT</ITAG>1.
