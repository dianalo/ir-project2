 Sphinx, developed by the West Germantelevision station Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen and Software AG, isovercoming initial wariness of reporters who did not trusttechnology to become popular with station employees.andP;  Sphinxallows for the integration of both formatted and unformatted data.andO;Sphinx is based on Software AG's Adabas database managementsystem, Text Retrieval System and Natural.andP;  Users with littledatabase experience can access Sphinx easily because it ismenu-driven.andP;

 Regardless of the formatof the data, journalists should be able to easily integrate that informationinto their own unformatted text files.andP;  Until recently, news bureaus reliedon a separate database for each type of data.andP;  These databases were slow inupdating information, difficult to search and impossible to integrate.andO;Although news organizations learned to live with the built-in deficiencies,editors and journalists hardly used the systems.andM;Guts and GloryandM;The need to overcome similar problems prompted West German television stationZweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF) located in Mainz to develop its Sphinxdatabase in cooperation with Darmstadt-based Software AG.andP;  The same demandfor information has prompted Frankfurt's newspaper Die Frankfurter AllgemeineZeitung to begin installing a database similar to Sphinx.andM;ZDF installed Sphinx on a test basis in late 1988.andP;  Systems planner HelmutKleinoeder reports that today a growing number of the station'scorrespondents are coming to understand the importance of Sphinx in relationto news-gathering activities and are &quot;overcoming their gut feelings againstand ignorance of such technologies.&quot;andM;In fact, says Guenter Alt, editor for ZDF's weekly economic program&quot;Wirtschaft Soziales&quot; (WISO), many journalists at ZDF are exploring ways touse the system to research news trends in order to anticipate stories sooner.andO;One possibility, he says, is a feature that allows the journalist to attachelectronic memos to story files.andP;  By creating an archive that records eachtime a new term or subject appears in the news, the editor or reporter isable to spot &quot;trends and megatrends,&quot; Alt says.andP;  Once a term has beenmentioned 30-odd times, he says, ZDF's staff could create a news show aroundit before the topic has been recognized by the station's competitors.andP;  &quot;It'san idea whose time is coming,&quot; Alt adds.andM;Sphinx retrieves and stores, word for word, every one of some 500 news agencyflashes produced daily by Deutsche Presse-Agentur.andP;  And it retrieves theitems within 10 seconds of them hitting the wire.andP;  (It was scheduled by presstime to have been upgraded to receive and store information from additionalnews agencies, including Reuters and the Associated Press.)andP;  The databaseruns on an IBM 3090-400 mainframe in Mainz and connects a loose SystemsNetwork Architecture (SNA) network of 1,000 terminals and workstations--themajority of which are at the station's headquarters.andP;  ZDF has on-lineconnections to its bureaus in Berlin, Bonn, Hamburg and Munich.andP;  The TVstation's goal is to provide the rest of its approximately 20 foreigncorrespondents with access to Sphinx.andM;Created on the basis of Software AG's Adabas database management system, TextRetrieval System (TRS) and Natural, Sphinx allows for the integration offormatted and unformatted data, letting a journalist combine search criteriarelating to both form and content in a single database query.andP;  TRS providesan interface that makes it possible to index the station's own unformattedtext files automatically by recording the coordinates of each word.andP;  Thus allthe facilities offered by adabas--and in particular the access to formatteddata via inverted lists--can also be used to retrieve unformatted data.andO;Sphinx is menu driven, allowing users with little database experience tosearch by entering the appropriate parameters.andP;  The same screens can bestored to allow a quick repeat or update of the search.andM;For example, 24 hours a day, an editor can search through all the station'snews reports, as well as public opinion polls, of Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sdiscussions with East German officials on the subject of currencystandardization over the last six weeks.andP;  It also allows the user toincorporate media buzzwords such as Contragate into a complex query.andM;Creative WritingandM;The freedom Sphinx gives the user in searching for information is thesystem's best feature, because it allows the user &quot;to research in a creativeway,&quot; says WISO's Alt.andP;  &quot;The journalist is a kind of detective when he usesSphinx,&quot; Alt says, adding that, ultimately, the database positively affectsthe depth and quality of the journalist's work.andP;  Kleinoeder says journalistsand editors appreciate the chance to form complex queries and searchdatabases without having to be IS experts.andM;The users also appreciate the greater timeliness and precision that Sphinxoffers.andP;  With the previous system, says Kleinoeder, you had to wait 24 hoursfor an update before running a search on today's data.andP;  Even then, he says,the parameters were so rudimentary that users were likely to &quot;come up with 10texts and a hundred misses.andP;  Now users are in control of the search.&quot;andP;  Altadds that many journalists opted to have the station's librarians searchthrough clippings rather than have to use the pre-Sphinx database.andP;  Thedrawback to that, he notes, was the uncertainty of doing research based onmaterials someone else had selected.andM;Obviously, Kleinoeder says, &quot;it was important for us to have quick access todata and use that data better.&quot;andP;  Leading a working committee of editors,archivists and IS managers, Kleinoeder conducted a needs assessment and thenwent to Software AG to discuss modifications and installation.andP;  SaysKleinoeder: &quot;Software was very eager to work with us--it was new territoryfor them.&quot;andP;  ZDF chose the configuration proposed by Software AG because it is&quot;flexible and can be expanded upon without running into astronomical costs.&quot;andO;Once Software AG had provided the basic product, he adds, &quot;ZDF made it fit.&quot;andM;Kleinoeder says ZDF will try to recover its costs by marketing Sphinx tointerested parties; the asking price is DM124,000 (without the necessarybasic software products from Software AG).andP;  Although the station has not setup a dedicated marketing arm, Kleinoeder's department is showing Sphinx toorganizations with similar information needs.andP;  &quot;It only makes sense to cometo us after you have the basic software from Software AG.andP;  First you're theircustomer, then you can be ours,&quot; he says proudly.andM;Projects like the one at ZDF reflect Software AG's goal of integratingsoftware applications.andP;  Says Ralf Meyer, product marketing manager, &quot;In thelong term, we're looking for an approach in which functions can be selectedfrom a uniform user interface.andP;  It makes good sense to transfer more and morefunctionality to lower levels.andP;  Users won't have to know where their data issituated, and programmers won't have to bother with different calls indifferent environments.&quot;andP;  Meyer says the next step in the company'sintegrated approach will be the introduction of geographical data.andP;  SoftwareAG will introduce its Adabas Geographical Information System this summer.andO;The new software, Meyer says, will allow the user to form queries thatconcentrate on specific areas and &quot;really customize the query.&quot;andP;  Meyer saysgovernment agencies, security authorities and large manufacturing firms areamong those interested in the wide range of applications.andM;Integrated InterestandM;Those organizations are not the only interested parties.andP;  According to a 1988research report prepared by International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass.,andO;the value of full-text retrieval systems shipments is expected to increasefrom $83.9 million in 1987 to nearly $680 million by 1992--equaling acompound annual growth rate of 52.3%.andP;  The same report also forecasts anincrease in the need to integrate full-text retrieval technology withword-processing and database management systems simply because textual datacontinues to come from many sources.andP;  For Frankfurt-based Diebold Germanyconsultant Oliver Berndt, reports that point to a trend are on target.andP;  SaysBerndt: &quot;The demand for systems [that integrate free and formatted data] isgrowing and will continue to grow.andP;  Before, the demand was small because thepossibilities were limited.andP;  Now the integration in a database is relativelyfast.&quot;andM;Despite the speed of integration, a number of complex bugs exist in theoverall integrated text retrieval systems on the market today, according toBerndt.andP;  &quot;There are problems in logistics, infrastructure and searchsequences--problems which won't necessarily be solved by the pace of softwaredevelopment alone.&quot;andP;  Meyer agrees that today's systems have some difficultyunderstanding the texts.andP;  Specifically, he says, the system has troubledistinguishing between the subject and object in a sentence.andP;  It is also&quot;generally helpless&quot; when trying to distinguish between elements of acomplicated sentence or a nonsensical sentence such as &quot;Peter Piper picked apeck of pickled peppers.&quot;andM;Meyer calls the difficulty in understanding complex sentences the &quot;broken armproblem.&quot;andP;  This means that, while the slight difference between a person whohas broken an arm and a person who broke his arm is for the user a merequestion of tenses, for the system is constitutes two entirely differentpieces of information.andP;  The system can thus yield results in a search thatdon't fully answer the user query.andP;  Consequently, text parsing in integratedtext retrieval systems will remain a problem for programmers to solve in thefuture.andP;  Meyer adds that integrating text retrieval and artificialintelligence is the next step toward solving the problem.andM;Peggy Trautman, a freelance journalist based in Bonn, West Germany, is afrequent contributor to DATAMATION.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
