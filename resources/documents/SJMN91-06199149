And with his 6-4 victory over the Giants, he continued to show that thisis his franchise.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AFTER TWO LOSSES, GOODEN FINDS A WAY TO BEATGIANTS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Gooden held the Giants scoreless for the first five innings and in themeantime contributed perhaps the biggest hit as the Mets built a 6-0 lead. TheGiants rallied once the hard-throwing right-hander left the game, but theyblew a chance to gain yet another game on the plummeting Los Angeles Dodgersin the National League West.;    &quot;My rhythm's been a lot better,&quot; said Gooden,who won for the fourth time in his last five decisions to improve to 9-6.&quot;This was big, because the Giants have been a tough club for me in my wholecareer.&quot;;    Gooden did not forget what the Giants did to him in May. Theybeat him twice within a week, both times behind Bud Black shutouts. The keythis time was pitching on a different night than Black, but you got the ideathat Gooden was somewhat due.;    On the other end of the spectrum was Giantsstarter Trevor Wilson (4-9), who lost for the third consecutive time. Wilsonlasted three-plus innings, because of some bad mistakes.;    The first one wasallowing Charlie O'Brien a leadoff single in the third. O'Brien had not had ahit since June 5, none at Shea since April 14. That brought up Gooden, whosquared around for the obvious bunt.;    &quot;I had a feeling at that point in thegame that Doc might swing through the pitch,&quot; Giants catcher Terry Kennedysaid. &quot;I called for a curve, and (Wilson) hung it.&quot;;    As first baseman WillClark charged in, Gooden pulled back the bat and swung away. The ball zippedpast Clark for a double just inside the bag.;    &quot;Anybody who hits a screamerthree inches down the line, I tip my hat to him,&quot; said Clark, who added thathe would play it the same way if the situation arises again. Mets Manager BudHarrelson said he did that so &quot;the next time they may not charge so hard,&quot; andadded that Gooden &quot;is one of the few guys who can do that.&quot;;    As for helpinghimself, Gooden said, &quot;Wilson was throwing well till then, and any time youget a hit like that, there's a good chance to break the game wide open.&quot;;   Which the Mets did. Wilson walked the bases full with none out. He struck outDave Magadan, but Gregg Jefferies blooped a single to right, giving the Mets a2-0 lead. Kevin McReynolds added an RBI single to left-center, and HowardJohnson completed the inning's scoring with a sacrifice fly. The Mets addedtwo more in the fourth.;    It was Wilson's second-shortest outing of theseason.;    &quot;I wasn't going to let things bother me,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;I got twostrikes on Jefferies, and he bloops it in there and I give up another hit. I'mnot pitching the way it takes to win.&quot;;    Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williamshomered, but it was not enough to undo the damage.;    &quot;I've seen Gooden pitchbetter, (but) he was pretty good,&quot; Giants Manager Roger Craig said. &quot;We hadour chances. The good thing about it is, we didn't lose any ground.&quot;;  HOWTHEY SCORED;    Mets 3rd -- O'Brien singled. Gooden doubled, moving O'Brien tothird. Carreon walked. With one out, Jefferies singled, scoring O'Brien andGooden and moving Carreon to third. McReynolds singled, scoring Carreon andmoving Jefferies to third. Johnson's sacrifice fly scored Jefferies.
