Jarvik as chairman and chief executive officer.    The company declined to give a reason for the dismissal but said, in a prepared statement, that it &quot;did not result&quot; from his opposition to a recent tender offer by two New York-based venture capital groups. Dr. Jarvik, co-inventor of the artificial heart for which Symbion is noted, couldn't be reached for comment. No successor has yet been named by the company.    The two groups, affiliated with E.M. Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co., recently completed a $3.50-a-share tender for about 2.2 million Symbion shares, gaining control of Symbion by increasing their stake to about 53% from 25.5%.    As previously reported, Dr. Jarvik initially opposed the tender offer as being too low and said Warburg Pincus had access to confidential information not generally available to shareholders. Symbion has acknowledged that Warburg Pincus had access to certain information but denied that it was &quot;material&quot; to the tender offer.    Dr. Jarvik last week abruptly dropped his opposition and agreed to tender his stake of about 8% of Symbion's 7.4 million shares outstanding. But in a previous Securities and Exchange Commission filing, he had issued a warning to directors, asserting that Symbion's continued success was &quot;substantially&quot; dependent on his future efforts.    Symbion, in a prepared statement last week, escalated the war of words by declaring that although it would &quot;regret his (Dr. Jarvik's) disassociation,&quot; the company didn't believe that its future was dependent &quot;on any one individual.&quot;    In his SEC filing, Dr. Jarvik also said he had negotiated a severance agreement with Symbion requiring the company to make certain payments to him if he was fired &quot;without cause&quot; within two years of a change in the company's control. Terms haven't been disclosed.    Symbion shares closed Friday at $3.50, up 25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
