 22nd Ave., Fort Lauderdale, FL33308; (800) 543-3511 or (305) 566-3511.andM;Version: 1.0.andM;Requires: System 4.2 or later; Finder 4.0 or later; 800K disk drive andhard-disk drive.andM;Application Size: DA, 114K; Dictionary file, 1.1 megabytes; Thesaurus file,352K.andM;Compatibility: Macintosh Plus or later.andM;Language MasterandM;You know those hand-held electronic dictionaries found in yuppie catalogssuch as that from The Sharper Image?andP;  Well, the information they contain isnow available in a DA called Language Master, a disk-based dictionary andthesaurus.andM;The original hand-held Language Master from Frank Computer is based onlinguistic code developed by Proximity Technology, the owner of theelectronic rights to Merriam-Webster's dictionaries and thesauruses.andO;Franklin Computer liked the code so much that it bought the company andfounded Franklin Software to market its programs.andP;  The code has also beenlicensed to other software vendors for inclusion in their own applications,such as Deneba's Spelling Coach Professional.andM;WHAT IT ISandM;Language Master is an ondisk dictionary and thesaurus -- not a spellingchecker.andP;  (If you want a spelling checker, see &quot;Checking Spellers,&quot; September'88.)andM;The dictionary contains definitions, hyphenation points, and informationabout parts of speech for more than 83,000 English words.andP;  The thesaurus has40,000 unique entry points with synonym information for different parts ofspeech.andM;Language Master comes on three 800K disks with a utility to install the DAand data files into the System of your choice.andP;  Because the files are solarge, a hard disk is required.andM;After you select Language Master from the Apple menu, &quot;LM&quot; appears at the farright of the menu bar.andP;  From this menu, you can look up definitions orsynonyms, change keys for commands, and specify the position of the LanguageMaster window.andM;HOW IT WORKSandM;Highlighting a word in a document and choosing Lookup Definitions from the LMmenu brings up a modal dialog box with definitions in a scrollable window sixlines deep.andP;  The dictionary and thesaurus share a fixed-sized window, so youcan't display both simultaneously or take advantage of larger screens todisplay longer entries in their entirety.andM;If a highlighted word is spelled incorrectly or can't be found in thedictionary, alternative spellings are suggested, based on phonetic andtypographic correction algorithms.andP;  To replace a suspect word in a document,you click on the replacement word and then click on the Replace button.andM;Language Master is unique in that the words in the thesaurus are properlyinflected to match the selected word's usage.andP;  For example, if you ask forsynonyms for jump, it shows you leap.andP;  If the word is jumped, the response isleapt.andP;  You can therefore rest assured that replacements make sense incontext.andM;You can also copy complete definitions and synonym lists into your documentsvia the Clipboard.andP;  For students of the English language, this feature is agodsend because you can retrieve a definition and then paste it into aword-processor file that you can print to create a simple flash card.andM;If you want to investigate further any word in the definition or synonym box,simply double-click on it and a new list appears.andP;  This cross-referencingfeature makes Language Master ideal for investigating the richness of theEnglish language.andM;Language Master has a wildcard feature that lets you search for words inwhich you've substituted question marks for any number of unknown letters.andO;Unfortunately, you're restricted to words that specifically match the numberof characters you've entered, so p???, for example, finds only four-letterwords that start with p.andM;As mentioned earlier, Language Master shares its lexicographical informationwith other programs, most notably Deneba's Spelling Coach Professional.andP;  ButCoach is a full-fledged spelling checker that costs $199, whereas LanguageMaster is an on-disk dictionary and thesaurus at half the price.andP;  If presentsinformation in a much more readable format than Coach does, and its thesaurusis more useful because it contains inflections, not just root words.andP;  On theother hand, Coach provides antonyms and Language Master doesn't.andM;With a few minor improvements, such as the addition of antonyms, resizablewindows, and a user-definable dictionary that could be particularly usefulfor businesses with specialized terms, Language Master would be a must-havefor those who work with words.andP;  As it is, this is a useful, reasonably pricedutility that's worth looking into if you're tired of constantly leaving yourMac to thumb through your old copies of Webster's.andP;  Although I doubt thatLanguage Master will ever replace the printed reference books it emulates, itmay give The Sharper Image a run for its money.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
