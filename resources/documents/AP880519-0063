The demonstrators called for an end to President Roh Tae-woo'sgovernment and demanded that the 40,000 U.S. forces based in SouthKorea under a mutual defense pact be forced to leave.   Clashes began when riot police fired volleys of tear gas tobreak up thousands of students trying to march past City Hall. Thehuge crowd fled as showers of tear-gas bombs exploded in its ranks.   Students retaliated with firebombs, rocks and bricks and battledpolice for control of the city's main shopping area. Firebombsexploded against buildings and among squads of riot police.   ``Down with the military dictatorship'' and ``Drive out theYankees,'' protesters screamed as they hurled rocks at police.   Riot police seized dozens of protesters and roughly hauled themaway. Both sides hurled rocks at and hit each other. Policedeclined to give any figures on arrests or casualties. It was theworst rioting in several months.   In the southern city of Kwangju, 3,000 students yellinganti-government slogans battled riot police with firebombs androcks today at Chonnam University. The battle began when policefired tear gas to stop the students marching into the streets.   Fighting started in Seoul after authorities allowed 25,000people to march and stage rallies for more than five hours inmemory of Cho Sung-man, a student who committed suicide on Sundayin a ritual form of anti-government protest sometimes used byradicals. His body was to be taken to Kwangju for burial.   The funeral procession marched through the center of the city,snarling traffic for miles.   ``Down with the murder regime,'' marchers shouted as musiciansin white mourning clothes beat drums and cymbals. Singers chanteddirges and dancers in white performed a ghost dance.   ``We will never end our struggle until we destroy Roh'sregime,'' said one angry woman student.   The march ended in front of City Hall, where protesters burnedan American flag as speakers denounced the government. Marcherswere to disperse under an agreement with police, but many startedto march again and police attacked.   Black police armored vans fired salvos of exploding tear gasbombs into the marchers and hundreds of cars were stranded in thesprawling City Hall square.   About 5,000 riot police in green combat fatigues poured into thestreets and chased fleeing students.   Students seized several nearby streets and set fire to part of asubway station and some shops as they hurled firebombs at police.Terrified pedestrians fled, many choking from the tear gas.Shopkeepers locked their doors and sidewalk vendors abandoned theirstalls.   Fighting swirled around several luxury hotels in the city centerand frightened foreign tourists looked on in astonishment or ranfor cover.   Firebombs set ablaze a roof garden at the Lotte Hotel and firetrucks forced their way through the fighting to extinguish the fire.   It was the third day in a row that the center of the city hadbeen hit by rioting. Protests began Tuesday to honor Cho and markWednesday's eighth anniversary of the Kwangju uprising in 1980.   Opposition leaders are pressing for an investigation into thesuppression of that anti-government uprising during which at least191 people were killed. Roh was a senior general at the time andthe opposition wants his role in the incident probed.   Protesters repeatedly denounced the United States, charging itmaintains military rule in South Korea and is responsible for thedivision of the Korean peninsula.``Unite the motherland,'' theyyelled.   The Korean peninsula was divided by Soviet and U.S. forces atthe end of clash. The south and communist north remain bitterenemies and often clash.   President Roh, who took office Feb. 25 after winning electionsin December, has introduced broad democratic and liberal reforms.But many Koreans distrust him because of his ties to pastauthoritarian regimes.</TEXT></DOC>
