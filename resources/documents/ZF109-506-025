 Grand-design AI may languish, but small adviser programs arerunning on their own or embedded in large production systems at almost everyagency.andM;Yet they number only a fraction of the expert systems being prototyped andpiloted today.andP;  Agencies desperately need simpler ways to train new workersand help them navigate the ever-growing maze of data and regulations.andP;  Whenan expert system works well, outside agencies are quick to pick it up.andM;For example, distribution began last month for Version 2.1 of anaward-winning Army expert adviser system whose knowledge base has beenadapted by the Air force and Naval Air Command.andM;The Logistics Planning and Requirements Simplification (LOGPARS) system wonan award from the American Defense Preparedness Association last March forimproving military logistics.andM;LOGPARS shows the potential for widespread, mainstream use within the DefenseDepartment.andP;  For one thing, it is supposed to remain compatible with DOD'sComputer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support standards throughout itscontinuing development.andP;  However, LOGPARS is for government use only.andO;Defense contractors cannot obtain it because of legal constraints.andM;The PC-based integrated system, developed by the Army Material Command'sMaterial Readiness Support Activity (MRSA) in Lexington, Ky., will receivePhase II and III funds from DOD's Productivity Enhancing Capital InvestmentProgram, which has given inspiration as well as money to expert systemefforts throughout DOD in the last several years.andM;MRSA is soliciting feedback from LOGPARS users on productivity and qualityimprovements in order to make a fiscal 1991 post-investment report to thefunding program.andM;This wide-ranging feedback promises to quantify the value of expert systemsmore thoroughly than the government has been able to do before.andM;According to MRSA, 491 people currently apply LOGPARS to 334 acquisitionprograms.andP;  LOGPARS has its own newsletter and electronic bulletin board fordistribution of changes and electronic mail.andM;The integrated modular system, which runs on 286-based micros like thestandard DOD Zenith Data Systems Corp. 248, offers advice on five topics.andM;The Strategy Adviser module asks the user a series of questions on programstrategy, including phases and types of acquisition.andP;  Then it recommendstasks and reports for each program element.andM;The Schedule Adviser module automatically tailors a milestone schedule basedon the program strategy.andP;  It shows dependencies and offers gaming, slipping,squeezing and flagging options to assess the impact of changes.andM;The Plan Adviser module leads the user through preparation of a baselineplan, complete with policy guidance and expert advice.andM;The Statement of Work Adviser tailors contractual requirements and itemizesdescription tasks.andM;The Warranty Adviser asks a series of question to determine legalrequirements and helps word a baseline warranty clause to go in the requestfor proposals.andM;Each module maintains an audit trail of questions and recommendations.andP;  MRSAis developing new modules to advise on costs, transportability and otherissues.andP;  The LOGPARS shell was written in the Prolog and C languages byAmerican Management Systems Inc. of Arlington, Va.andM;The Agriculture Department's National Agricultural Library has two workingexpert advisory systems that help reference librarians and end users locatematerials on nutrition and fish farming.andP;  One of the advisers has been in usefor more than 12 years.andM;A third working expert system makes it possible for agricultural analysts toreuse dozens of professionally developed on-line database search routines.andM;The three PC-based expert systems, all written with the 1st-Class shell fromAICorp Inc. of Waltham, Mass., have a payback in terms of saved staff timeand improved access to knowledge, said Gary McCone, head of the library'sDatabase Administration Branch.andM;McCone said the library also is developing a more elaborate expert systemwith the KnowledgePro shell from Knowledge Garden Inc., Nassau, N.Y.andP;  TheRegional Information System for African Aquaculture is supported by theUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and contains hypermedia suchas color maps and full-text CD-ROM searchers.andM;At the Treasury Department, which devotes more than 15 percent of its budgetto information handling larger expert systems have been in use for years.andM;Treasury's new Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), for example,was able to adapt a 1984-era expert system, originally written for theCustoms Service by Grumman Corp., to track down laundering of money.andM;FinCEN analysts consult the 500-rule expert system  at a group of ApolloComputer Inc. workstations.andP;  They search for suspicious patterns in the lasttwo years' worth of bank currency transaction records.andM;Joseph Lisnock, assistant director of FinCEN's Operations Support Division,called the expert system a major investigative tool that pays off in assetsseized criminal investigations initiated.andM;The Internal Revenue Service has two expert systems in production use, saidTed Rogers, chief of the IRS artificial intelligence lab in Washington.andP;  Athird has completed its pilot stage and is being expanded to multiple sites.andM;The first, the Magnetic Media Waiver Assistant, has been running at the IRSMartinsburg, W.Va., computer center since 1988.andP;  It allows an employee todetermine whether to waive requirements for businesses to file their taxinformation on magnetic tape rather than paper.andM;Criteria for waivers include such things as small number of workers, lack ofcomputer expertise or newness in business.andP;  Formerly, Rogers said, it tookfive employees to handle the volume of requests.andP;  And IRS granted too manywaivers, sometimes erring by giving a business more than one waiver in ayear.andM;The Waiver Assistant program, which runs on an IBM PC, makes possible moreconsistent and equitable decisions about granting waivers.andP;  Claude Archer ofRogers' staff created the program in six months with the Ops 5 version of theLisp language developed at Carnegie-Mellon University.andP;  It has been rewrittenin C.andM;Unlike many expert advisers, the Waiver Assistant has a well-defined payback.andO;Rogers said the administrative savings run about $400,000 per year.andM;Not only was the number of employees granting waivers reduced from five toone, but the service also has fewer paper filings to transcribe.andM;The second IRS expert system, known as the Actuarial Assistant, is innationwide use by IRS employee plan specialists who audit pension plans.andM;Also PC-based, the Actuarial Assistant helps the auditors determine whetheremployers have entered correct actuarial data about things such as percentageof executives in their pension plan.andM;Big ConsequencesandM;The auditor's decisions have big consequences.andP;  &quot;There are too fewactuaries,&quot; Rogers said, &quot;and too often Guesswork is involved.andP;  These planshave to hold up in court.andP;  If plans don't qualify, then the payments thatemployees have made into them are not tax-deductible.&quot;andM;The Actuarial Assistant was developed in C++ by Seth Meltzer of rogers'staff.andP;  Its payback, also well-defined, runs about $100 million a year inadditional taxes owed to the IRS by non-qualifying plans.andM;A third system, the Tax Service Expert Assistant System, has completed itspilot test in Boston and, after gaining a larger knowledge base, will move onto five more sites.andM;The Tax assistant helps employees answer taxpayers' telephone inquiries.andP;  IRShas been criticized for inaccurate responses to these queries.andP;  The servicehopes to stave off a drop in taxpayer compliance by giving better answers.andM;At the Social Security Administration, a PC-based Computer-Assisted EmployerClassification (CAEC) program went into production use last year.andP;  It assignsfour-character codes to employers according to the nature of their business.andO;Cary Green, director of the Office of Systems Planning and Integration, saidCAEC is working well.andM;A second expert system, now in prototype, will support the disabilityinsurance program.andP;  The Disability Determination Expert Systems Project isdesigned to help SSA field employees interpret the law and medical evidenceconsistently, even though they may have little experience with disabilityclaims.andM;A third program, the Overpayment Waiver System, which is undergoingvalidation, will assist claims representatives in handling beneficiaryoverpayments and will issue notices of decisions.andM;&quot;We have six full-time people in-house working on expert systems on 386 PCsin our development center,&quot; Green said.andP;  &quot;They spend some of their time onuser education.andP;  &quot;We have a number of shells available and have gotten thebest results from Knowledge Pro and 1st-Class Fusion.andP;  The newer systems havehypertext interfaces.&quot;andM;Green said he is &quot;excited about expert systems for our 1,300 field offices.andO;But we don't have many PC's in the field, so how do you get out updates?andP;  Itbecomes a fairly substantial distribution and configuration managementproblem.andP;  One expert system on one PC for one worker in a field office justwon't cut it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
