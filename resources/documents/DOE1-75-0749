While preperihelion observationsare noted to be inconsistent with most comets at the wavelengths in question,they are in approximate agreement with the visible continuum trend determinedby Newburn and Spinrad (1985) in 1980 observations. A drop in intrinsicbrightness occurring at a postperihelion heliocentric distance of 0.75AU suggests that this comet's thermal lightcurve may involve an asymmetryabout the perihelion which resembles that at visible wavelengths. 24references.</TEXT></DOC>
