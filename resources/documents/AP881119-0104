VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Iran-Contra prosecutor argued Saturday thatslightly differing views on congressional power should not cloud thecentral issues of lying and deceit in the criminal case againstOliver L. North.   Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh said a Justice Departmentbrief filed Friday in U.S. District Court did not go to the heart ofhis case against North and instead was concerned with side issues ofconstitutional law and the separation of powers.   The Justice Department, in its friend-of-the-court brief, arguedthat the case arose ``in the context of a policy dispute between theexecutive and legislative branches with respect to foreign affairs.''   However, Walsh wrote in a brief filed Saturday that thedepartment had misinterpreted his arguments.   Walsh maintained that the independent counsel was not trying toshow that ``mere mere policy disagreements with Congress arecriminal'' or ``even that open defiance of enacted congressionalrestrictions on foreign military ventures would be criminal.''   Instead, he continued, North's actions became crimes when theformer National Security Council aide lied to Congress and tried toobstruct inquiries into his activities.   ``What converts a wrongful defiance of legal restrictions intocriminal activity is the effort to defeat operation of the lawthrough deceit, craft, or trickery, or at least by means that aredishonest,'' Walsh wrote in the brief.   North is charged with conspiring illegally to divert profits fromU.S. arms sales to Iran to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Alsocharged are former national security adviser John M. Poindexter,arms dealer Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord.   North, who is to be the first of the defendants to stand trial,also is charged with 15 other felonies, including lying to Congress,obstructing a presidential investigation and pocketing $90,000 intravelers' checks from the Contras.   No trial date has been set.   Walsh minimized his differences with the department concerningthe lines of authority over foreign policy from the White House andCapitol Hill.   ``There is no substantial or relevant difference between theviews of executive power expressed by (the Justice Department) andthose advanced by the independent counsel's memorandum,'' Walshwrote.   ``To the the extent that the department's submission has assistedin clarifying those views, we hope this exchange has been helpful tothe court,'' Walsh wrote. ``We equally hope, however, that thedepartment's willingness to attribute divergent views to theprosecution has not obscured the issues in this case, or the clearfact that the department has conspicuously failed to support any ofthe defendant's constitutional claims.''   However, Walsh pointedly referred to the public manner in whichthe Justice Department aired its disagreement with the prosecutor,calling it ``well-publicized advocacy.''   ``We note that the department's memorandum was distributed to thepress for presentation at a press conference before it was served onindependent counsel or filed with the court,'' said Walsh, whoreleased his own arguments after filing them with the court anddelivering a copy to the Justice Department.</TEXT></DOC>
