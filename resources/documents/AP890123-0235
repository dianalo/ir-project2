Nosensitive secrets were penetrated. But the anguish a now-famouscomputer virus produced last November has led to soul-searchingabout computer security. The fact is that the machines arevulnerable to all sorts of interference, from playful hackers tosophisticated criminals. Second of three articles.</TEXT><NOTE>By SID MOODY</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bad news is that computers getdiseases.   The worse news is that when they do, the illness can spread atthe speed of light, leaving everything from household accounts tobusiness data to power plants to defense systems fatally stricken.   Apocalypse now? It's not just a movie.   ``There's a potential risk that matches the destructiveness of anuclear attack,'' warns Donn Parker, an authority on computer crimeat SRI International here.   In only a few short years, computers have become the bedrock ofhow the United States and, increasingly, the developed worldoperate. Computers handle half a trillion dollars in U.S. banktransfers a day. They guide planes through the air and back to land.They monitor hospital patients, predict weather, run phone systems,plant crops and check the results out of supermarkets, store anydata imaginable. Your bank balance. The national debt. When acomputer gets sniffles, a whole system can catch pneumonia.   Computer technology advances almost daily. So do the techniquesof computer security. So do the threats of someone, witting orunwitting, monkey-wrenching whole systems.   Computers get sick for the same reasons humans catch flu or VD.They interconnect. The illnesses bear the same familiar names thatattack people: worms, bugs, viruses. They work the same way,invading a system and replicating or infiltrating until the body isoverwhelmed.   A worm broadly believed to have been planted last November byCornell grad student Robert Morris within hours fouled up some 6,000interconnected computers in a defense-university network. Estimatesof the damage done and the man-hours spent to repair it run from $20to $95 million.   The origins of computer disease vary. Begin with the hacker, thecomputer junkie who spends every waking minute bopping around incomputerland exploring its fascinations. Then come the mischievous,then the malicious and then the outright criminal: the embezzler,the corporate spy. What Donn Parker fears is the arrival,eventually, of the terrorist.   Some case histories of computer illness, benign and less so:   In 1986 then Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir was about togive a speech which said:   ``Let us say yes to a great, massive, successful and victoriousHerut movement.''   Just before delivery it was discovered an otherwise-mindedemployee had wormed his way into Shamir's computer and changed thetext to read:   ``Let us say yes to a tiny, worrying and incompetent Herutmovement.''   In Fort Worth, Texas, an uneasy employee planted a ``time bomb''in his company computer. Any time his name did not appear,indicating he'd been fired, the hidden instruction would activate,destroying the firm's files.   About five years ago in New York, students at the exclusiveDalton School found their way into the computers at theSloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. They were discoveredbefore they could do any damage, intended or inadvertent, to medicalfiles.   In Hayward, Calif., a rapist used a computer to get the addressesof women he attacked by tracing their license plates through statefiles to which he had access. In the Equity Funding scandal of the'70s, a ring used computers to steal some $70 million.   Besides the federal government, 48 states have laws againstcomputer crime. The remaining two, Vermont and West Virginia, areconsidering introducing legislation this year.   ``In effect, the laws say thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not dodamage and thou shalt not trespass,'' said Jay BloomBecker, who runsthe National Institute for Computer Crime Data in Los Angeles. Heestimates computer crime may have reached the billions-a-year levelin the United States. ``The problem is getting society to treatcomputer crime as it does other crimes.''   Computers are a natural for disease and crime because they arevulnerable. They are vulnerable because their usefulness ismagnified many times over when they talk to each other to exchangenews or data or memory. Unfortunately, that means they can shareinfection.   ``A network is for exchange of information,'' says RichardKoenig, associate director of the Computer Security Institute inNorthborough, Mass. ``If it needs a lot of security, you defeat itspurpose.''   ``Any communication designed for easy access is subject totampering,'' says Bill Cunningham, head of management informationsystems for The Associated Press.   To stop tampering or worse, Koenig foresees the day when accessto computer networks will be encoded like a scrambler phone. Butthat only makes computers even more intimidating to the unpracticedlayman than they already are. It's a dilemma.   To the hacker, it's more likely a challenge. ``The more complex asystem gets, the more nooks and crannies for hackers to try and getinto,'' says Tom Mandel, a computer futurist at SRI. This is not topoint a finger at hackers. Quite the contrary. Their contribution totechnology is inestimable. They push machines beyond their designedlimits to new horizons. Their genius with software is one reason theUnited States leads the world in that technology.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
