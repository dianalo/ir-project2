At a news conference, Bush said he is appointing Thornburghbecause ``I know that he will work with me to fight drugs with everytool at our disposal'' and on other issues as well, includingattacking crime ``at every level'' and defending the civil rights ofall Americans.   Since election day Nov. 8, a number of other names had emanatedfrom the Bush camp as possible replacements for Thornburgh.   In a brief interview at the Justice Department, Thornburgh saidthat he had learned of Bush's decision to retain him at a weekendmeeting initiated by the president-elect and that ``I was extremelypleased and gratified that he made this appointment.''   Bush's decision ``gives me the opportunity to continue what Ihope will be a positive and productive course for the department,''Thornburgh said in the interview. ``My priorities will be thepresident-elect's priorities.''   In addition to fighting drugs, Thornburgh said ``our efforts in... white-collar crime, official corruption should be important toensure high ethical standards in government and our businessinstitutions.'' He singled out the environment and civil rights asother areas warranting attention.   Thornburgh, 56, has been in the Cabinet only since Aug. 12, whenhe succeeded Edwin Meese III, who resigned at the conclusion of a14-month criminal investigation of his affairs. Meese declared hehad been vindicated. But the independent counsel who conducted theprobe, while deciding not to seek an indictment, said Meese probablyhad twice broken a federal conflict-of-interest law and violated taxlaws.   Bush, asked the day after he was elected president if he wouldkeep on Thornburgh and several other Reagan Cabinet membersconsidered to be ``Bush people,'' did not answer directly.   He said that ``some people at various levels may be asked toremain,'' but that ``there is something to be said forreinvigorating the process by, with new people.''   Indeed, Bush insiders had sent mixed signals about the future ofThornburgh, who was said to be eager to keep his job. At one point,those insiders had gone out of their way to discourage reports thathis reappointment was assured.   Other names that had been tossed about as possible replacementsfor Thornburgh were William D. Ruckelshaus, a former deputy atJustice and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator,and Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson.   In taking over the Justice Department, Thornburgh, a formergovernor of Pennsylvania and U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, had vowedto ``make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1.''   Thornburgh headed the department's criminal division during theFord administration and established the agency's public integritysection, which prosecutes corrupt public officials.</TEXT></DOC>
