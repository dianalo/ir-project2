 Around the world, nearly 300,000draftsmen, architects, and designers are using its AutoCAD drafting program.andO;The company's market share is three times that of its closest competitor.andO;Its customer base is diversified.andP;  By steadily improving AutoCAD and workingclosely with its dealers and independent developers, the company has becomeone of the most profitable software publishers in personal computing, and itis still growing rapidly.andM;Yet Autodesk is making only halting progress toward design automation's nextlevel, the third dimension.andP;  The company has failed in its two-year effort tointegrate the two-dimensional AutoCAD drafting package with advancedthree-dimensional design techniques, and this inability has forced the firmto rethink its strategy for growth.andP;  Although a recently unveiled plan holdspromise, it could take up to two years to succeed.andP;  Meanwhile, competitorsaren't standing still, and Autodesk may be preparing for an unwinnable war.andM;We think the company will continue to prosper without three-dimensionalsoftware; even those who specialize in such software aren't selling a lot ofit.andP;  One reason is that, although adding a third dimension can aid designerswho need to visualize a product that doesn't yet exist, most products areactually manufactured from engineering drawings or blueprints, which aretwo-dimensional.andP;  Over the next few years, however, we believe demand for 3Dsoftware will rise rapidly as the prices continue to fall for the computersthat can run it well.andP;  Consequently, Autodesk could miss a major opportunity.andO;As yet, it's far from clear that the dominant force in the market fortwo-dimensional drafting programs will do as well when three-dimensionalprograms become more popular.andP;  That our outlook for Autodesk remainsoptimistic despite this uncertainty underscores the value of momentum indesktop software and of a publisher's deep understanding of what customersactually do with its products.andM;Autodesk rose to power in the mid-eighties as leaps in hardware and softwaretechnology altered the economics of computer-aided design and computer-aidedmanufacturing.andP;  Low-priced personal computers and workstations gavebudget-conscious engineers unprecedented access to run compute-intensive CADapplications.andM;Win, place or showandM;Although dozens of new companies set out to compete with the traditionalturnkey CAD/CAM vendors -- Computervision, Intergraph, Calma, Applicon (nowSchlumberger), and McDonnell Douglas -- Autodesk took greatest advantage ofthe movement toward so-called open systems.andP;  Autodesk wrote its program torun equally well on many different brands of computers at a time whenprograms from the traditional CAD vendors would operate on only a singlebrand.andP;  One result was a price advantage: A system from the older vendorscost between $45,000 and $75,000 for each engineer who used it; Autodesk'scost about $12,000 -- that's $3,000 for the software and about $9,000 for afully-equipped computer.andP;  In addition, Autodesk was free from worries aboutwhich brand of desktop computer would prove most popular -- writing AutoCADin the C language insured that no matter which computers won, AutoCAD wouldrun on them.andM;Lowering the sightsandM;From the customer's perspective, open systems meant one could run severalvendors' CAD software packages in addition to standard applications such asword processors, spreadsheets, database managers, and, where possible, games-- all on the same machine.andP;  As demand for the IBM PC and compatibles rose,Autodesk rode the wave.andM;Meanwhile, existing turnkey vendors were forced either to follow Autodesk'slead by making their software available on a variety of platforms, or losecustomers to open systems.andP;  Thus, the turnkey competition -- Computervision,Intergraph, McDonnell Douglas, and Applicon -- was forced to drop ambitioussoftware development plans and to focus on open platforms support.andP;  The taskwas large.andP;  At Computervision, for example, six million lines of code had tobe ported to a then untested Sun UNIX platform.andM;Digital vs.andP;  IBMandM;While the turnkey vendors were retrenching, another component of Autodesk'sstrategy, indirect sales, began to pay big dividends.andP;  Indirect sales meantthat Autodesk passed along expensive selling costs to its dealers.andP;  It alsomeant that its sales force did not compete with the principal hardwarevendors, in this case IBM and the PC compatible manufacturers.andP;  Turnkeyvendors, on the other hand, relied on hardware, advanced 3-D applications,and after-sales support for high profit margins -- all of which depended onworldwide direct sales and service organizations to reach key customers.andP;  Butthe competitive terrain was changing quickly.andP;  Dissatisfied as the largestCAD original equipment manufacturer, DEC transformed itself from board-levelsupplier to finished systems provider with a direct sales force.andP;  To leaveaccount control in the hands of the turnkey CAD/CAM sales force, DECconcluded, was to capitulate in the face of IBM's quest for domination of theFortune 500.andM;Suddenly, turnkey vendors found that DEC offered prices lower than they couldmatch, eating into their profit margins and forcing them to rethink theirstrategies.andP;  Intergraph, for example, embarked on an ambitious, internallydeveloped UNIX workstation strategy, cutting its reliance on DEC.andP;  It evenbought its own microprocessor division to control enhancements made to itsnascent RISC processor, Clipper.andM;When to fold 'emandM;In retrospect, what led to the decline (although by no means the downfall) ofthe mainstream CAD/CAM vendors was technological hubris, or the belief thatone could survive being all things to all people.andP;  Indeed, those that refusedto curtail their ambitious, unfocused agendas were quickly devoured in theensuing CAD/CAM industry consolidation: General Electric swallowed Calma thenSchlumberger swallowed Applicon.andP;  Prime took Computervision then VersaCAD andwhat was left of Calma after GE had sold Calma's electronics team to ValidLogic.andP;  In the meantime, Autodesk kept moving right along.andP;  What one AutoCADrelease lacked, the next one quickly provided.andP;  Specialized enhancements forarchitects and design engineers were added either by Autodesk or its thirdparty development team.andM;A system of one's ownandM;As 1990 unfolds, sales for Autodesk are running at an annual rate of $200million, with operating margins of 38%.andP;  To raise sales further, one obviouscourse is to sell more copies of AutoCAD to today's customers.andP;  There arestill thousands of engineers and drafters who share a single desktop computerrunning AutoCAD.andM;Existing customers are also buying improved versions of AutoCAD.andP;  Upgrades,we estimate, account for as much as 15% of the company's AutoCAD revenue, andthe proportion probably will increase.andP;  The tenth release of AutoCAD offers3-D wireframe design for the first time.andP;  AutoCAD 386 is expressly written totake advantage of the 32-bit processing power of the Intel 80386 and offerscapability beyond DOS's 640K RAM barrier.andP;  A recently released OS/2-basedversion of AutoCAD provides partial support for the Presentation Managergraphical user interface that seems likely to dominate PC-based applicationsfor several years.andM;Getting up for the upgradeandM;Of late, however, Autodesk has been tardy with some of its product upgrades.andO;So, we'll be closely watching Release 11, which could add $20 million toAutodesk sales in its first 12 months on the market.andP;  Release 11, originallyexpected in the first quarter of the year, now seems likely to ship in thethird quarter.andM;At the low end, Generic Software, a six-million-dollar acquisition completedlast year, is slowing the advance of inexpensive AutoCAD imitations for theIBM PC and Macintosh.andP;  Generic's CAD packages, priced from $200 to $500,enable Autodesk to dominate the drafting market from entry level throughfull-feature two-dimensional CAD.andM;Why bother with it?andM;Although the purchase helped Autodesk by giving it access to a new channel,retail, the union of the two product lines is something less than perfect.andO;Because Generic is intended for first-time users, such as building and spaceplanners, home renovation hobbyists and the like, there is only limitedtwo-way file compatibility with AutoCAD.andP;  Generic is run as a subsidiary withits own retail distributio channel and development team.andP;  Generic CADD issold by some independent AutoCAD dealers as more &quot;feature rich&quot; entry-levelalternative to AutoSketch, the $150 internally-developed package for line artand illustrations.andP;  The network of Autodesk dealers, however, has littleincentive to sell Generic CADD because the margins are lower.andP;  There also islittle opportunity to make money through after-sale support or follow-onsales of programs that work directly with it.andM;Not invented hereandM;In trying to protect its interest on potentially important new computingplatforms, Autodesk also sometimes misses the mark.andP;  We are, for example,very disappointed by the company's Macintosh efforts.andP;  When it moved to theMac, Autodesk adapted the DOS product rather than create a file-compatibleequivalent that could take advantage of the Mac II and compensate for itsshortcomings.andP;  As a consequence, the majority of Mac customers bought Prime'sVersaCAD program.andP;  More recently, Claris CAD has become the leading Macintoshproduct as a result of its superior interface -- which makes the product moresuitable for retail distribution -- and the apparent distraction of VersaCADdevelopers by the corporate difficulties at Prime.andP;  A startup, Ashlar, alsois attracting attention.andP;  The lesson here is that just because Autodesk leadson DOS machines doesn't mean that newcomers don't stand a chance on emergingplatforms, asuch as the UNIX workstations based on RISC microprocessors.andM;Autodesk has also not impressed us with new product development.andP;  AutoCAD isstill the core product, accounting for more than 90% of the firm's revenue.andO;Excluding a new animation package designed to tap the so-called multimediamarket, Autodesk has expanded to new areas by acquiring companies or formingalliances, not through internal development.andP;  Three-dimensional modeling forarchitectural design and mechanical engineering is the principal growthtarget.andM;Half-speed aheadandM;Three-dimensional modeling, or the ability to create, visualize, and test newproduct ideas in three-dimensional space, began appealing to Autodesk severalyears ago.andP;  Nevertheless, Autodesk's initial foray into the 3-D market hasfailed to gain even a toehold for the firm.andP;  Three years ago it acquiredCadetron, a company that developed a solids modeler for the personalcomputer.andP;  Unable to integrate this product properly into AutoCAD, Autodeskwas faced with its first embarrassment.andM;Outward from the coreandM;A key shortcoming was the link between AutoSolid and AutoCAD, which was, andremains, weak.andP;  AutoSolid runs only under the Xenix operating system, whichwas no help to AutoCAD's DOS-based customers who make up nearly the entirecustomer base.andP;  Second, the user interface was different from AutoCAD,another barrier to widespread use.andP;  Finally, the underlying AutoSolidtechnology lagged recent improvements made by the competition.andP;  Intergraph,for example, learned to integrate solids with advanced surface modeling.andO;Thus, a product design with curved surfaces could be passed to manufacturingalong with precise numerical instructions for machining operations.andO;AutoSolid, on the other hand, lacks surface modeling capability.andP;  ParametricTechnology introduced a solids modeler with an intuitive, graphical userinterface, that enabled designers to &quot;edit&quot; and change their solids models,without having to start from scratch -- another barrier to widespreadacceptance of solids technology.andP;  While none of these new products runs onpersonal computers, the rapidly falling prices of workstations, combined withdecreases in RAM pricing make the new technology widely accessible.andM;In 3-D, the linchpin in Autodesk's new strategy is the use of SpatialTechnology's solids modeling engine, a new data structure that will replaceAutoSolid.andP;  Unlike the Cadetron acquisition, which brought in a complete 3-Dapplication product, Autodesk's strategy with Spatial is to buy only the coretechnology around which solids, surfacing, and machining applications arebuilt.andM;Take your choiceandM;Rather than develop these applications internally, Autodesk will license theSpatial solids engine to its 600-plus third-party developers.andP;  The hope isthat this will produce a flood of three-dimensional applications, all linkedto AutoCAD.andM;The Spatial solids engine provides developers with the flexibility to designapplications according to their preference.andP;  Rather than mandate technologychoices for its developers, the solids engine provides the freedom toincorporate new design methodologies, such as:andM;* NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) a technology to develop precise,&quot;machinable&quot; parts,andM;* parameter or feature-based design, which allows the designer to work withdesign elements, rather than crude geometric shapes (a la ParametricTechnology), andandM;* variational, or rule-based modeling, which forbids design changes that areinconsistent with previously defined constraints (a la Structural DynamicsResearch).andM;The sooner the Spatial tools are provided to its developer base, the quicker3-D applications will be developed.andM;The hurdles aheadandM;However, when the new applications do arrive -- by all accouts sometime inlate 1991 -- Autodesk will encounter several obstacles:andM;* Limited Market Opportunity -- While new user interfaces and low-cost,albeit non-DOS, platforms make the technology more available, not everyoneneeds 3-D, Structural Dynamics Research, the larget software-only competitordedicated to the three-dimensional field, had software-related revenues ofonly $66.5 million last year.andP;  (The balance of the company's $93.6 million in1989 revenues came from consulting services.)andP;  That's less than half ofAutodesk's total and comes after twenty years in the business.andP;  Annualrevenues are less than $20 million apiece at Parametric Technology andCADKey, the two other leading three-dimensional, software-only vendors.andO;Specialists in solids modeling and animation, such as Alias Research andWaveFront, also aren't yet large.andM;* High Switching Costs -- To change from Lotus 1-2-3 to Microsoft Excel isn'tall that difficult.andP;  The file conversion process is imple and easy tounderstand, and any parts of a spreadsheet that don't convert easily -- suchas special calculations -- can usually be redone without too much effort.andO;Customers using three-dimensional systems, however, have large investments intheir databases, including design, analysis, training, and archiving.andP;  Mostdesigners -- as much as 80% of them -- base new drawings on old ones.andP;  MostCAD suppliers to offer programs that can convert files according to theInitial Graphics Exchange Specification, but a large company could spendmonths converting all its files.andP;  Even then, users would have to beretrained.andM;* Lower Switching Benefits -- In contrast to the days when two-dimensionaldrafting programs were new, customers may not save all that much byconverting to personal computers from the workstations or minicomputers theyare using now for three-dimensional work.andP;  Once the additional memory,mass-storage, and graphics acceleration requirements are taken into account,the prices of workstations and advanced PCs are comparable.andP;  In addition,some vendors of three-dimensional software for workstations offer a growthpath that PC vendors don't.andP;  At Silicon Graphics Computer, for example,software that runs on the company's $15,000 Personal Iris workstation alsoruns on its $100,000-plus systems.andP;  Vendors of CAD systems also are more&quot;open&quot; that they were in the days when Autodesk got its start.andP;  McDonnellDouglas, for example, resells Hewlett-Packard and DEC systems, both of whichcan run the UNIX operating system.andM;* Entrenched Competition -- The most obvious customers for three-dimensionalmodeling already are using such systems and work closely with such suppliersas Computervision, IBM, SDRC, McDonnel-Douglas, and Intergraph.andM;* Distribution Channel Challenges -- An indirect network of resellers isadequate for selling drafting software, but cannot substitute for theday-to-day contract provided by a direct sales force.andP;  While Autodeskrecently added a direct sales force, its strength and efficiency areuntested.andM;I summary Autodesk's success will be determined by how soon third-partydevelopers deliver new applications and how quickly 3-D technology isembraced by existing AutoCAD users.andP;  The ability to penetrate the 3-D marketthrough reliance on dealers and developers is an open question.andP;  The successof 3-D software firms SDRC and Parametric Technology underscore this point:Both rely on an extensive network of OEM customers and large accounts forsuccess.andM;And one does not quickly build relationships with aerospace, automotive, andindustrial complexes.andP;  Unless the advantage is extraordinary, engineeringdepartments won't discard what they are now using.andM;Furthermore, if a business model akin to that of an SDRC or ParametricTechnology is required what does that imply for the future of Autodesk'sprofits?andP;  The after-tax net margins at both SDRC and Parametric are less thanhalf those at Autodesk.andP;  If adding the third dimension does require a largerdirect sales forces, can Autodesk afford it?andM;It seem to us that the better strategy is to attempt gradual penetration ofthe 3-D market.andP;  If Autodesk can continue to grow a while longer at 30% to50% a year on the basis of its two-dimensional products, it can continue toresist the pressure to build a strong position in 3-D.andM;We find three-dimensional graphics compelling, and 3-D already has becomesomething of a checklist item in specifications, even for programs that willbe used two-dimensionally almost all the time.andP;  We are convinced that theZ-axis, shades, surfaces, and even motion, have an important future inscientific, medical, and engineering visualization.andP;  Software thatincorporates the third dimension in a useful way -- not merely giving theillusion of depth and substance -- will become more commonplace.andP;  But itwon't happen overnight.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
