At least the      impact surface portion of the head body is constituted by a thin plate      consisting of a thermoelastic type martensite transformation alloy. The      thickness of the impact surface portion is set in the range of 1.0 to 5.0      mm, and is smaller than that of each of the blade and sole portions of the      head body. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to an iron type golf club head having a head      impact face portion whose structure is improved and, more particularly, to      an iron type golf club head wherein the impact face portion of a head body      is constituted by a thin plate consisting of a thermoelastic type      martensite transformation alloy so as to improve directional stability      upon impact and increase a carry. </PAR><PAR>  Conventional golf club heads having various structures have been proposed.      For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 59-228874 discloses a      wood type club head having a solid or hollow structure and constituted by      a wood material such as persimmon, a metal material such as stainless      steel, and a high-modulus material obtained by using carbon fiber as a      reinforcing material, i.e., carbon fiber reinforced plastic called CFRP.      Japanese Patent Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 60 7873 discloses an iron type club      head in which the impact face portion of a head body is constituted by an      Ni-Ti alloy containing 50 to 60 wt. % of Ni with the balance of Ti, or by      a thermoelastic type martensite transformation alloy in which part of Ni      or Ti of an Ni-Ti alloy is substituted with at least one element selected      from the group consisting of Fe, Co, Zr, V, Cu, and Al. In addition,      Japanese Patent Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 60-7872 discloses a wood type club      head, in which the impact face portion of a head body is constituted by a      Cu thermoelastic type martensite transformation alloy containing at least      one element selected from the group consisting of Zn, Al, Ni, Si, Sn, Mn,      Ag, Mg, Sb, Ga, Ge, and In within the range in which a 8 brass structure      can be obtained with the balance of Cu. </PAR><PAR>  In such a golf club structure, since the impact face portion of a head body      is made of a thermoelastic type martensite transformation alloy exhibiting      thermoelastic martensite transformation within the temperature range of      -120.degree. C. to andplus;20.degree. C., super elastic behavior upon rebounding      of a ball due to flexibility based on a stress-induced martensite caused      upon impact can be utilized to increase the contact area of the head with      the ball and prolong a contact time. Therefore, so-called &quot;ball holding&quot;      is good. As a result, the directivity of the hit ball is stable, and the      carry can be increased. </PAR><PAR>  In the above-described club head, however, the impact face portion of a      head body is simply constituted by thermoelastic type martensite      transformation alloy exhibiting thermoelastic martensite transformation,      and the head body has a solid structure while the impact face portion is      backed up by another head material. In such a club head, even though the      head body has a hollow structure, if the thermoelastic type martensite      transformation alloy has a normal thickness of about 6 to 10 mm, super      elastic behavior upon rebounding of a ball due to flexibility based on a      stress-induced martensite caused upon impact cannot be efficiently      utilized. Therefore, the effects of improving energy transmission with an      increase in contact area of the head with a ball and prolonging a contact      time cannot be fully realized. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention has been made in consideration of the above      situation, and has as its object to provide an iron type golf club head      capable of efficiently utilizing super elastic behavior upon rebounding of      a ball due to flexibility based on a stress-induced martensite caused upon      impact. </PAR><PAR>  In order to achieve the above object, according to the present invention,      there is provided an iron type golf club head comprising a head body      constituted by a blade portion, a sole portion, and an impact surface      portion, wherein at least the impact surface portion of the head body is      constituted by a thin plate consisting of a thermoelastic type martensite      transformation alloy, and a thickness of the impact surface portion is set      in a range of 1.0 to 5.0 mm and is smaller than that of each of the blade      and sole portions of the head body. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention having the above-described arrangement,      since the impact face portion of the head body is constituted by a thin      plate consisting of a thermoelastic type martensite transformation alloy,      super elastic behavior upon rebounding of a ball due to flexibility based      on a stress-induced martensite caused upon impact can be efficiently      utilized. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing a main part of an iron type golf club      head according to an embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view of the club head in FIG. 1; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a sectional view showing a main part of a second embodiment of      the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail      below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 1 and 2 show an iron type golf club head according to a first      embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, reference      numeral 1 denotes a head body constituted by, e.g., a metal material such      as stainless steel, cast iron, or brass, or CFRP. The head body 1 has a      triangular sectional area obtained by increasing its thickness from a      blade portion 1b on the upper edge to a sole portion 1c on the lower edge      such that an impact face portion 1a has a predetermined degree of loft. In      addition, an opening portion 2 is formed while a portion 1A for supporting      the periphery of the impact face portion 1a is left. A thin plate 3      consisting of a thermoelastic type martensite transformation alloy is      bonded to the impact face portion 1a so as to seal the opening portion 2. </PAR><PAR>  The thickness of the thin plate 3 consisting of a thermoelastic type      martensite transformation alloy and constituting the impact face portion      1a of the head body 1 is set to be 1.0 to 5.0 mm, preferably, in the range      of 1.0 to 3.0 mm. The thickness of the thin plate 3 is set to be smaller      than that of the blade portion 1b or the sole portion 1c of the head body      1. The thin plate 3 constituted by an Ni-Ti thermoelastic type martensite      transformation alloy, an Ni-Ti thermoelastic type martensite      transformation alloy in which part of Ti of an Ni-Ti alloy is substituted      with 0.1 to 2.0 wt. % of at least one element selected from the group      consisting of Pt, Pd, Fe, Co, V, Cu, and Al, or a Cu thermoelastic type      martensite transformation alloy, each exhibiting a thermoelastic      martensite transformation in the temperature range of -120.degree. C. to      andplus;20.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows a second embodiment of the present invention, wherein a head      body 1 and a thin plate 3 consisting of a thermoelastic type martensite      transformation alloy and constituting an impact face portion 1a are      integrally formed by using the same material. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  Impact face portion samples of a head body of the present invention were      made of a 56Ni-Ti alloy as a thermoelastic type martensite transformation      alloy. Impact face portion samples of a conventional head body were made      of, e.g., a 18Cr-8Ni-Fe alloy. Carry and directional stability with      respect to changes in thickness (mm) of the impact face samples were      compared by using symbols .circleincircle., .largecircle., .DELTA., and x      respectively representing superiority which decreases in this order.
