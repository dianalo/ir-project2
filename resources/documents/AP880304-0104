The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez alsooutlawed the selling of tobacco to anyone under 16.   The ban will take effect in July, three months after itspublication in the official state bulletin. It was in keeping withdirectives issued by the European Economic Community.   Representatives of Spain's tobacco industry agreed to accept acomplete ban on television advertising and restrictions limitingoutdoor advertising to the name of their brand.   According to EEC statistics, 41 percent of Spain's 38.8 millionpeople smoke, the second highest figure in the 12-nation communityafter Greece.   The same statistics indicate about 60,000 Spaniards die eachyear from smoking-related diseases.   The decree requires cigarette and cigar packages to carry thewarning that smoking causes cancer and endangers the life of thesmoker as well as unborn babies.   It bans smoking in hospitals, department stores, elevators andplaces where pregnant women work and prohibits the sale of tobaccoproducts to minors under 16.   The decree says that the rights of non-smokers over those ofsmokers will take priority in all legal questions. It carries fineson infractions ranging from $4,400 to $880,000, but its enforcementmechanism remains unclear.   Spanish explorers who traveled to Central and South America inthe 16th century returned with string-tied rolls of tobacco leavesthat became the rage among their wealthy countrymen under the name``cigar.''   Etymologists believe the word comes from ``sik'ar,'' the termthe Mayan Indians of Central America used for smoking.   ``Cigarillos'' or ``little cigars'' were devised by streetbeggars in Seville from the butts of cast-off cigars and are theforerunners of today's cigarettes.</TEXT></DOC>
