The possibility that thesecompounds function as primary donors (P700) or acceptors (A{sub 0} orA{sub 1}) is considered by comparing their properties with those of Chla in vitro and those of P700, P700{sup +}, A{sub 0}{sup -} and A{sub1}{sup -} in vivo. The triplet zero field splittings of the chlorinatedcompounds, and the redox, optical and ESR characteristics of their anionsand cations do not differ widely from those of Chl a. These results donot offer, therefore, clear diagnostic signatures that would unambiguouslyidentify the putative chlorinated species in vivo, not do they provideobvious advantages (or disadvantages) for a biological role for chlorinatedchromophores.</TEXT></DOC>
