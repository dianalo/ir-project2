In sawtoothfree, ohmicallyheated plasmas with I/sub p/=1.5 MA, n-bar/sub e/=(2-3)x10/sup 19/m/sup-3/, q(a)=3.2, no radiation buildup is observed. The temporal evolutionof injected titanium has been measured by VUV and X-ray crystal spectrometersand PIN diodes. The spectral lines of Ti XX (259.3 A) and Ti XXI (2.6097A) are compared with one-dimensional diffusive/convective impurity transportcalculations. The transport calculations for Ohmic discharges with I/subp/=1.5-2 MA, n-bar/sub e/=(1-3)x10/sup 19/m/sup -3/, q(a)=3-3.7, showthat D/sub A/=(1-2)m/sup 2/center dots/sup -1/ and that the inward convectivevelocity is small. In neutral beam heated plasmas with I/sub p/=1.5 MA,n-bar/sub e/=4x10/sup 19/m/sup -3/, q(a)=3.6, P/sub b/=8 MW, no differenceis observed in the global time evolution of the Ti XXI line emissionsbetween co- and counter-injected discharges. The experimental observationsare well represented by choosing D/sub A/=(1-2)m/sup 2/center dots/sup-1/ and a small inward velocity. (author). 22 refs, 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
