(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The release of a woman jailed for refusingto disclose the whereabouts of her son was blocked when U.S. SupremeCourt Chief Justice William Rehnquist stayed a Maryland Court ofAppeals order.   Acting at the request of the state attorney general's office,Rehnquist stayed the appelate ruling Monday pending a response fromJacqueline Bouknight's attorneys by noon Wednesday, said SupremeCourt spokeswoman Toni House.   Maryland's highest court had ruled 5-2 earlier Monday thatCircuit Judge David B. Mitchell violated Ms. Bouknight'sconstitutional protection against self-incrimination by sending herto jail.   Mitchell found Ms. Bouknight, 21, guilty of contempt for refusingto tell social workers last April where they could find her27-month-old son, Maurice. She has remained in jail sine then.   The Department of Social Services put the child in foster careafter he was admitted to a hospital on Jan. 23, 1987, at the age ofthree months with a broken leg and several partially healedfractures.   The department returned the child to Ms. Bouknight the followingAugust when she agreed not to physically punish the boy and toundergo training in how to be a parent.   Last April, the department filed a petition saying the child hadnot been seen since September 1987 and that Ms. Bouknight hadrefused to disclose his whereabouts. The petition also said theboy's father had been shot to death and that Ms. Bouknight had ahistory of drug abuse.   The appeals court's majority opinion by Chief Judge Robert Murphynoted that prosecutors fear Maurice is dead or has been abused.   ``The state readily acknowledges that Bouknight's risk ofincriminating herself is a substantial one, encompassing, amongother possible crimes, the felony of child abuse and even murder,''Murphy said, adding that the court can't ignore her constitutionalprotection against self-incrimination.   A dissenting opinion by judges James McAuliffe and LawrenceRodowsky rejected the notion that she would be incriminating herselfby revealing her son's whereabouts.   The state's brief in the case argued that the importance ofprotecting the child outweighed Ms. Bouknight's right not toincriminate herself.</TEXT></DOC>
