Clark and try him primarily on embezzlement counts instead.    Mr. Clark, a lawyer, is one of the people who allegedly traded on inside stock information misappropriated from The Wall Street Journal in 1983 and 1984 by former Journal reporter R. Foster Winans. Mr. Clark was indicted on 55 felony counts in January.    The lead prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr., said the decision to permanently drop the insider counts was &quot;purely a scheduling decision.&quot; Federal Judge John F. Keenan had earlier ruled that the Clark trial had to be postponed -- effectively until next spring -- until the Supreme Court rules on Mr. Winans's appeal of his insider-trading conviction. With the insider-trading counts dropped, the judge said the Clark trial may proceed Oct. 5.    The remaining counts accuse Mr. Clark of defrauding clients of his law firm, perjuring himself, evading taxes, and making false statements before the Securities and Exchange Commission by denying that he received information from Mr. Winans.    Mr. Clark has pleaded innocent to all the charges. </TEXT></DOC>
