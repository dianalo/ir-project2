Police said one guerrilla was killed and another was woundedalong with his 2-year-old son. It was Israel's third air strikeagainst Palestinian targets in Lebanon since January.   The air strike came a day after guerrillas in south Lebanonfired Soviet-made Katyusha rockets into northern Israel, shatteringwindows and damaging citrus trees. No casualties were reported.   The new assault was mounted by six Israeli fighter-bombers,demolishing a two-story building used as a base by the DemocraticFront for the Liberation of Palestine with four direct shell hits,police said.   The Moscow-oriented front, headed by Nayef Hawatmeh, is one ofthe eight factions making up Yasser Arafat's PLO.   A red Mercedes-Benz was seen buried in the rubble of thestricken base in Aynab in the Chouf Mountains overlooking Beirut'sinternational airport. The base is just eight miles from Beirut.   Palls of black smoke billowed from the target and police saidall traffic at the airport was suspended for 15 minutes.   The sound of explosions could be heard across the city as thehowling jets criss-crossed the skies, drawing anti-aircraft firefrom guerrilla positions.   Pilots released balloons to deflect heat-seeking, shoulder-firedSAM-7 missiles unleashed by guerrillas. White puffs of smoke dottedthe sky around the planes, but none was hit.   Police said the jets staged repeated mock attacks on Palestinianbases in nearby Chemlan, Bayssour and Kabr Shmoun in the 10-minuteraid, sending hundreds of villagers as well as guerrillas divingfor cover.   But there were no bombing sorties against bases in thosevillages of the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command and the Fatah-Uprising, both at odds withArafat.   The Israeli army command said the targets had ``served as basesfor planning and launching attacks against Israel.''   ``All our planes returned safely and the pilots reported thedestruction of the targets,'' a short Israeli statement said.   The guerrilla who was killed was standing sentry outside thebase when the jets struck at Aynab, said the front's Choufcommander, who goes by the nom de guerre of Abu Raad.   He said the wounded child, who was identified only as Mohammed,suffered wounds in the head from flying glass shards. His father,who is a front fighter, was injured in the face and waist.Mohammed's mother was not hurt.   One guerrilla crawled out of the debris unharmed. He stood overthe rubble, flashing the ``V'' for victory sign with one hand andbrandishing a Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifle with the other.   Abu Raad said the casualties were low because the PLO hadordered all guerrillas in Lebanon to brace for air attacks inretaliation for Palestinian riots against Israel's occupation inthe West Bank and Gaza Strip. The violence began Dec. 8.   Israeli warplanes raided targets near Sidon, 25 miles south ofBeirut on Jan. 2 and March 12. Police said 25 people were killedand 40 wounded in the two attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
