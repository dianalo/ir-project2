Japan bought 12.3% of its chips from foreign companies in November, down from 12.6% in the April-June period, according to figures from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    &quot;It's not good news at all,&quot; said an official of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, who asked not to be named.    Although government and industry officials fear the decline could spark U.S. ire, they are preparing to fight accusations that Japan is the guilty party. Foreign firms, they say, often aren't able -- or willing -- to make enough of the chips Japan needs. &quot;The chips we want just aren't there,&quot; an NEC Corp. official said.    &quot;It's ridiculous to argue about market share without looking at the reasons,&quot; said Junji Yoshihara, a ministry official in charge of semiconductor trade. Any U.S. criticism over the slipping market share, he said, implies that &quot;Japan is supposed to buy 20% no matter how bad the quality or service is . . . We can't just sit here and take it forever.&quot;    In September 1985, Japan and the U.S. signed an agreement that called for Tokyo to buy more foreign chips. An unofficial understanding provided that Japan would buy about 20% of its chips from foreign makers by 1990. But market share didn't grow as much as hoped, and last April the U.S. slapped duties on selected Japanese imports in retaliation. Some of those duties remain in effect.    In response, the trade ministry urged Japanese companies to buy more foreign chips, and electronics makers kicked off crash programs to replace Japanese-made chips with foreign products. The plans worked -- for a while. Foreign chip sales grew to 12.6% of the Japanese market in early 1987 from 10.3% a year earlier.    But the growth stopped in June. Sales of foreign chips in Japan are still increasing but total sales, including Japanese chips, have grown even faster.    The ministry blames the limited number of products sold by foreign companies in Japan. &quot;There are a certain number of chips a maker can simply pull out of his product and replace with a foreign chip,&quot; said Mr. Yoshihara, the ministry official. &quot;But now everybody has already bought what they could easily use.&quot;    Big chip buyers like Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony Corp. traditionally work closely with Japanese chip makers who tailor-make semiconductors for such products as videocassette recorders and compact disk players. In the past, few American companies made these custom chips. In 1986, Sony said, U.S. companies made only 3% of the types of chips it needed for its videocassette recorders.    Japanese companies have begun working with U.S. companies to design such chips, but the ministry says it will take several years before those efforts are reflected in trade statistics.    The ministry said it has been swamped by complaints that foreign companies often rebuff the efforts of Japanese firms to buy chips. They say U.S. companies can't meet delivery schedules, only partially fill orders and sometimes refuse to design chips to Japanese specifications.    &quot;The feeling here,&quot; said Mr. Yoshihara, &quot;is that since demand in the U.S. is so good, American companies don't have anything left to sell to Japan.&quot;    Although the U.S. semiconductor industry is in the midst of a boom as a result of skyrocketing demand in this country, industry officials say the Japanese have been slow in opening their markets.    Some U.S. manufacturers, however, have made progress selling more chips to Japan since last spring. A spokesman for Texas Instruments Inc., which operates the largest foreign-owned chip plant in Japan, said, &quot;We have benefited greatly from Japan's new 'buy foreign' campaign.&quot; He said specific sales figures weren't available. </TEXT></DOC>
