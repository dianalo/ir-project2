The proposedrulemaking would establish conditions under which OTC skin protectant drugproducts for the treatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poison oak,and poison sumac as well as for the treatment and/or neutralization ofinsect bites are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded.FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking after considering thestatements on OTC drug products for poison ivy, poison oak, and poisonsumac, and for use as insect bite neutralizers of the Advisory Review Panelon OTC Miscellaneous External Drug Products, public comments on an advancenotice of proposed rulemaking that was based on those statements, and publiccomments on the notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC skin protectant drugproducts. (See the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 15, 1983; 48 FR 6820.)

The noticeswere published to allow for consideration of statements on OTC drug productsfor the prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and for useas insect bite neutralizers. The statements were prepared by the MiscellaneousExternal Panel, which was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluatingdata on the active ingredients used for these conditions. Interested personswere invited to submit comments by December 6, 1982. Reply comments inresponse to comments filed in the initial comment period could be submittedby January 5, 1983.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 28, 1982 (47 FR 57738), in responseto a request for an extension of time, the comment period and reply commentperiod for OTC skin protectant drug products were extended to February4, 1983, and to March 7, 1983, respectively. In accordance with andSection;330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on public display in the Dockets Management Branch(address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information.One trade association and five drug manufacturers submitted comments concerningthe use of skin protectant drug products for poison ivy, poison oak, poisonsumac, and insect bites (poison ivy-oak-sumac and insect bites). Some ofthese comments were submitted to both the external analgesic and skin protectantrulemakings. In those cases where the same comments were submitted to bothrulemakings, the comments will be addressed only in the appropriate amendmentto either the proposed rule for OTC skin protectant drug products or forOTC external analgesic drug products published elsewhere in this issueof the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Copies of the comments received are on publicdisplay in the Dockets Management Branch.   The Panel provided general statements on OTC drug products for the preventionof poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and for use as insect bite neutralizers.However, the Panel did not review all of the submitted individual ingredientsnor develop labeling for drug products for these indications. Also, thePanel reviewed only ingredients with labeling claims for prevention ofpoison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac, or for treatment of insect bitesby neutralization or inactivation of insect venom. However, many submissionsto the Panel were for drug products used to treat the symptoms (i.e., itching,minor irritations) of poison ivy-oak-sumac and insect bites by the mechanismof providing a physical or mechanical barrier to protect the exposed skinsurfaces from harmful or annoying stimuli. Additionally, a number of skinprotectant drug products labeled for the treatment and/or prevention ofpoison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac and for the treatment and/or neutralizationof insect bites were not submitted to the Miscellaneous External Panel.Therefore, the agency is expanding the scope of this segment of the skinprotectant rulemaking to include all OTC skin protectant drug productslabeled for any of these uses.In this document, the agency is addressing comments concerning drug productsfor the treatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, and poisonsumac and for the treatment and/or neutralization of insect bites whenthe mechanism of action for these uses involves the ingredient's abilityto neutralize or inactivate insect venom or the ingredient's ability toprovide a mechanical barrier to protect exposed skin surfaces from harmfulor annoying stimuli. In the external analgesic rulemaking (published elsewherein this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>), the agency is addressing claims for the treatmentof symptoms of poison ivy-oak-sumac and insect bites when the mechanismof action for these claims involves the depression or stimulation of cutaneoussensory receptors.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6820), the agencypublished a tentative final monograph (proposed rule) for OTC skin protectantdrug products. The agency issued this notice after considering the reportand recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Topical Analgesic,Antirheumatic, Otic, Burn, and Sunburn Prevention and Treatment Drug Products(Topical Analgesic Panel) and public comments on an advance notice of proposedrulemaking that was based on those recommendations.Interested persons were invited to submit comments by April 18, 1983, newdata by February 15, 1984, and comments on new data by April 16, 1984.In response to that notice, one manufacturer's association and five drugmanufacturers submitted comments concerning the use of skin protectantingredients for the treatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poison oak,and poison sumac as well as for the treatment and/or neutralization ofinsect bites. The agency is also addressing these comments in this noticeof proposed rulemaking. Copies of the comments received are on public displayin the Dockets Management Branch (address above).In this notice of proposed rulemaking, FDA responds to public comment andfurther discusses its position on OTC skin protectant drug products forthe treatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumacas well as for the treatment and/or neutralization of insect bites. Finalagency action on this matter will occur with the publication at a futuredate of a final rule relating to OTC skin protectant drug products forthese conditions.The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) now provide that anytesting necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerlyresulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of theresults of that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTCdrug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.Accordingly, FDA will no longer use the terms ``Category I'' (generallyrecognized as safe and effective and not misbranded), ``Category II'' (notgenerally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``CategoryIII'' (available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective,and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage, but willuse instead the terms ``monograph conditions'' (old Category I) and ``nonmonographconditions'' (old Categories II and III). This document retains the conceptsof Categories I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph stage.The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products thatare subject to this monograph would be generally recognized as safe andeffective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12months after the date of publication of the final monograph in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. On or after that date, no OTC drug product thatis subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognizedas safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unlessit is the subject of an approved application. Further, any OTC drug productsubject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effectivedate of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardlessof the date the product was initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouragedto comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date.If the agency determines that any labeling for a condition included inthe final monograph should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effectivedate, a shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety problemis identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a shorter deadlinemay be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products.All ``OTC Volumes'' cited throughout this document refer to the submissionsmade by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notices publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 16, 1973 (38 FR 31697) and August27, 1975 (40 FR 38179) or to additional information that has come to theagency's attention since publication of the advance notices of proposedrulemaking. The volumes are on public display in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>The agency has reviewed the comments submitted to this rulemaking. As notedabove, most of the comments were also submitted to the external analgesicrulemaking. The agency has addressed the general comments in the proposedrulemaking to amend the tentative final monograph for OTC external analgesicdrug products, published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. These comments are incorporated into this rulemaking.1. One comment requested that colloidal oatmeal be included in the skinprotectant monograph as a safe and effective ingredient for the claim:``For prompt temporary relief of itchy, sore, sensitive skin due to: ** * poison ivy/oak * * *.'' The comment based its request on the MiscellaneousExternal Panel's review of colloidal oatmeal as an antipruritic at thatPanel's 23d meeting on January 29 and 30, 1978. The comment noted thatthe Panel found colloidal oatmeal at all concentrations to be safe andeffective as a bath additive, cleansing bar, and soak for the symptomaticrelief and treatment of dry skin and the resultant itching (Ref. 1).The comment contended that colloidal oatmeal falls within the Topical AnalgesicPanel's definition of a skin protectant. The comment argued that, due toits physical and chemical properties, colloidal oatmeal isolates exposedskin or mucous membrane surface from harmful or annoying stimuli. (Seeproposed andSection; 347.3 at 43 FR 34628 at 34648; August 4, 1978.) Moreover,the comment added that colloidal oatmeal meets the Panel's criteria describedat 43 FR 34630 in that it protects by mechanical or other physical means,is inert, insoluble, finely subdivided, and adsorbs some moisture. Thecomment stated that colloidal oatmeal that is dispersed in water and appliedto the skin deposits particles on the skin and leaves behind an occlusivefilm barrier that is helpful in protecting skin against irritation andin soothing irritated or pruritic skin conditions. The comment added thatcolloidal oatmeal when added to water controls the osmotic pressure ofwater with respect to the skin and permits adequate water to enter intothe stratum corneum. The comment stated that the oatmeal leaves behinda thin occlusive film on the skin and this serves to hold in the adsorbedmoisture. The result of this coating is that the skin is protected againstirritation; hence, the ingredient has an antipruritic and generally soothingeffect. The comment noted that the Topical Analgesic Panel stated at 43FR 34630 that ``* * * the fluids from seeping rashes or toxic dermatoses(poison ivy, poison sumac, * * *) are absorbed or adsorbed by many of thesedrugs. Often itching is ameliorated.'' Based on the above, the commentcontended that the following claim for colloidal oatmeal is justified:``For prompt temporary relief of itchy, sore, sensitive skin due to: ** * poison ivy and oak * * *.''The Topical Analgesic Panel stated at 43 FR 34630 that well-controlledclinical studies have not been conducted for most of the skin protectantingredients. The Panel recommended that the requirement for well-controlledstudies be waived, on the grounds that clinical studies are not necessaryto support the use of mechanical barriers such as these ingredients toprotect the skin from further injury. The agency agrees with this recommendationregarding skin protectant (physical barrier type) ingredients.In addition, the agency agrees that colloidal oatmeal qualifies as a skinprotectant because of its barrier-like properties. Montebovi (Ref. 2) identifiedand evaluated a number of hydrophilic colloids including colloidal oatmealusing the ``Gold Number'' as a means of determining the protective abilityof hydrophilic solutions. The ``Gold Number'' is an in vitro physical chemicaldetermination intended to measure the protective ability of hydrophiliccolloids. Montebovi also measured and evaluated the viscosity of hydrophiliccolloids with particular reference to colloidal oatmeal and stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The colloidal adsorbents are used in dermatology primarily for theirprotective demulcent effects. On the basis of the physical properties ofthe agents commonly used for this purpose, the role of colloidal oatmealappears to be well founded. Chemically it is made up of gums, protein,and oil in a ratio which is consistent with the desirable characteristicsof the purified agents. Its high protective colloidal activity is demonstratedby the low Gold Number. The viscosity and surface tension establish a goodspreading and clinging property which would be necessary for sustainedprotective action.</ITAG>Furthermore, the agency has reviewed the data submitted by the comment(Ref. 3) in view of the Panel's recommendations and concludes there issufficient information to demonstrate that colloidal oatmeal is safe andeffective when used in a bath to relieve minor skin irritation and itchingdue to poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. The comment cited theMerck Manual (Ref. 4) which recommends that, in extensive pruritis, thepatient should soak for 10 to 20 minutes twice a day in a colloidal oatmealbath. Also, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations (Ref. 5)states that pruritus accompanying acute dermatitis or extensive exanthematouslesions is often alleviated by immersion of the part or the entire bodyin water and that colloidal substances can be added to such baths for theirsoothing and antipruritic activities. It recommends the use of colloidaloatmeal added to a tub half-filled with water.Other references submitted by the comment also describe the use of colloidaloatmeal in therapeutic baths to relieve minor skin irritation. Epstein(Ref. 6) recommended tepid colloidal oatmeal baths (250 grams in a tubof water twice daily) to ease discomfort in cases of generalized dermatitis.Lewis and Wheeler (Ref. 7) recommended the use of baths (e.g., colloidaloatmeal \1/2\ to 1 cupful to a tub of water) when dermatosis is extensiveand stated that such baths are used for their soothing or antipruriticproperties and are often the most efficient method for applying medicationto exudative surfaces. Whyte (Ref. 8) stated that, in acute (exudative)dermatitis and subacute dermatitis (less exudative), colloidal oatmealin warm water should be used to soothe and coat the inflamed skin witha bland colloid. Whyte added that a paroxysm of itching is often best treatedby a comfortable warm colloid bath once or more daily. O'Brasky (Ref. 9)described one patient with ``an erythematous, vesicular and edematous eruption,typical of a contact dermatitis (ivy) * * * .'' The investigator statedthat the patient responded well to treatment with colloidal oatmeal baths(no other medication was used), and was discharged 10 days after treatmentbegan. O'Brasky treated 111 patients with dry skin manifestations (includingone patient with multiple insect bites) and noted that the colloidal oatmealbaths had antipruritic properties because patients complained of recurrentitching when the baths were omitted. The agency agrees with the comment that the evidence is supportive of thegeneral recognition of colloidal oatmeal as a safe and effective skin protectant.Based on the available information, the agency believes that colloidaloatmeal could be classified as a Category I skin protectant when labeledwith the following claim: ``Provides temporary skin protection and relievesminor irritation and itching due to poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac,and insect bites.'' However, in order for colloidal oatmeal to be generally recognized as safeand effective as a skin protectant, the agency must have sufficient dataon the composition and concentration of the different constituents andthe quantity (range) of each that is contained in marketed products. Foran ingredient or mixture to be included in an OTC drug final monograph,it is necessary to have publicly available chemical information that canbe used by all manufacturers to determine that the ingredient is appropriatefor use in their products. The comment submitted a report by MonteBovi (Ref. 2) that describes colloidaloatmeal as a specifically milled constant fraction of the colloid-producingportion of the oat grain, having a chemical analysis of 46 percent carbohydrate,9.0 percent oil, 24.0 percent protein, 8.0 percent moisture, and 0.03 percentcrude fiber. However, the agency does not find this information to be anadequate public standard for colloidal oatmeal. The agency believes that it would be appropriate for interested partiesto develop with the United States Pharmacopeial Convention appropriatestandards for the quality and purity of colloidal oatmeal. In this tentativefinal monograph, colloidal oatmeal is proposed in Category I. However,should interested parties fail to provide necessary information so thatan appropriate standard may be established, colloidal oatmeal will notbe included in a final monograph. The comment submitted the following directions for the use of colloidaloatmeal in a bath: Turn the warm bath water on to full force, then slowlysprinkle one cupful of colloidal oatmeal into the bathtub under the faucet.Before entering the tub, stir any colloidal oatmeal that may have settledto the bottom of the tub. Bathe for 15 to 20 minutes. For infants, use2 tablespoonfuls per bath. Use once or twice daily, or as directed by yourphysician. The agency is proposing these directions for colloidal oatmeal with minorrevisions. Because it is desirable to leave a thin layer of the colloidaloatmeal on the skin after bathing, the agency is adding directions to patthe skin dry, rather than to rub it dry, after the bath. In addition, thesubmitted labeling recommends a dosage for infants, but it does not specifya particular age range, how much water to which the 2 tablespoonfuls ofcolloidal oatmeal should be added, or how it should be added to ensuredispersion of the colloidal oatmeal to make a colloidal suspension. Ingeneral, infants would be bathed in something smaller than an adult-sizedtub and the amount of water would be less. Therefore, the agency has notincluded specific directions for children under 2 years of age at thistime and requests specific comment on appropriate directions for this agegroup as well as a possible lower age limit for use of this ingredient.Based on the submitted labeling, the following directions are being proposedfor colloidal oatmeal for use as a skin protectant: Adults and children2 years of age and over: For use as a soak in a tub. Turn tub warm waterfaucet on to full force, then slowly sprinkle 1 cupful of colloidal oatmealdirectly under the faucet into the tub. Before entering the tub, stir anycolloidal oatmeal that may have settled to the bottom of the tub. Soakthe affected area for 15 to 20 minutes as needed. Do not rub area dry,but instead pat dry so that a thin layer of the colloidal oatmeal willbe left on the skin. Soak once or twice daily, or as directed by your doctor.Children under 2 years of age: consult a doctor. In addition, several references mentioned that patients should be carefulwhen using colloidal oatmeal in a bath to avoid slipping in the tub (Ref.3). Current labeling for the submitted product states: ``Take special careto avoid slipping'' (Ref. 10). The agency believes it is appropriate topropose that a statement like this be required as a warning for skin protectantdrug products containing colloidal oatmeal. The agency is expanding thestatement to read ``Take special care to avoid slipping when getting intoand out of the tub'' to make it more specific for consumers. <ITAG tagnum="73">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Summary of Minutes of the Twenty-Third Meeting of the AdvisoryReview Panel on OTC Miscellaneous External Drug Products, January 29 and30, 1978, OTC Volume 16DPA1, Docket No. 78N-0021, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) MonteBovi, A.

Two comments requested that corn starch be classified as a CategoryI skin protectant for the treatment of poison ivy, poison oak, and poisonsumac. One comment, noting that the agency had tentatively deleted cornstarch from the skin protectant tentative final monograph until diaperrash drug products are reviewed, stated that although corn starch is widelyused in diaper rash products, it is also an ingredient in skin protectantproducts for use by the general population. The second comment agreed withthe agency's proposal that the maximum Category I concentration of cornstarch be raised from 85 to 97 percent (48 FR 6820 at 6826). However, thecomment disagreed with the agency's statement in the tentative final monographthat ``at the present time none of the proposed Category I indicationsare applicable to corn starch,'' (48 FR 6820 at 6828). Accordingly, bothcomments requested that corn starch be included in the skin protectantmonograph as a general skin protectant labeled with the following indicationproposed in andSection; 347.50(b)(3) of the tentative final monograph: ``Driesthe oozing and weeping of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.''The Topical Analgesic Panel classified 10 to 85 percent corn starch asa Category I skin protectant in its report (43 FR 34628 at 34636). Oneof the skin protectant indications recommended by the Panel for corn starchin andSection; 347.50(b) reads ``For symptoms of oozing or weeping'' (optional,any or all of the following) ``due to contact dermatitis, poison oak, orpoison ivy'' (43 FR 34648). In its discussion of corn starch, the Panelmentioned that absorption by corn starch probably surpasses that of anypowder described in the official compendia. It protects the skin by absorbingmoisture, perspiration, and noxious secretions, and it soothes dermal irritationand itching (43 FR 34636). However, the Panel did not cite any studiesor literature references on the use of corn starch for the treatment ofpoison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, or other types of contact dermatitis.In the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products(48 FR 6820 at 6828), the agency stated that ``at the present time, noneof the proposed Category I indications are applicable to corn starch. Mostof the uses of corn starch discussed by the Topical Analgesic Panel arecosmetic uses. The primary OTC drug use of corn starch appears to be indiaper rash drug products.'' Therefore, the agency did not include cornstarch in the tentative final monograph, but deferred evaluation of cornstarch until its use in diaper rash drug products was reviewed. That evaluationwill be published in a future issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.In the present document, the agency is classifying topical starch in CategoryIII for the treatment of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Although ``corn starch'' has been used as the name for thisingredient, ``topical starch'' is the official title used in the UnitedStates Pharmacopeia XXI (Ref. 1).</ITAG>The comments did not submit any data on the use of topical starch for useas a treatment for poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. In addition,the submissions to the Panel do not contain any data on the use of topicalstarch as a poison ivy treatment. Several articles in one submission statethat starch is used to cover and protect the skin, mucous membranes, ulcers,and wounds, but also state that water-absorbent powders should not be usedon extensive profusely secreting raw surfaces, as they tend to cake andform adherent crusts, and that starch becomes doughy (Refs. 2 through 5).Further, although two submissions to the Panel contain information on productscontaining topical starch and include poison ivy labeling claims (e.g.,helps dry weeping of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac), the therapeuticproperties of the products were attributed to other ingredients in theproduct, and topical starch was only included as an inactive ingredient(Ref. 6). Other submissions of products containing topical starch did notcontain any poison ivy treatment labeling claims (Ref. 7). Additionally,the agency is unaware of any products that bear poison ivy treatment labelingclaims that contain topical starch as an active ingredient.The initial symptoms following exposure to poison ivy include erythemaor rash. The development of raised lesions follows, and finally vesiclesand bullae form, caused by fluid accumulation in the epidermis. The initiallesions usually are marked by mild to intense itching and burning. Theaffected area, often hot and swollen, oozes and eventually dries and crusts.Most cases of poison ivy are self-limiting and disappear in 14 to 20 days(Ref. 8). Topical starch is safe when applied topically, but should notbe used on broken skin because crusting and skin granulomas have been knownto occur when starch is applied to broken skin (Refs. 9 and 10). Thus,because of the weeping and oozing vesicles associated with poison ivy andrelated contact dermatitis, the agency believes that topical starch maynot be appropriate to treat the symptoms of poison ivy, poison oak, andpoison sumac. Further, because of a lack of data on effectiveness and asuitable concentration of topical starch for this use, and because theagency is unaware of any marketed products that contain topical starchas an active ingredient for the treatment of poison ivy, as discussed above,the agency proposes that topical starch be classified in Category III asa skin protectant drug product for the treatment of poison ivy, poisonoak, and poison sumac. Other skin protectant uses of topical starch willbe addressed in the diaper rash amendment to the tentative final monographfor OTC skin protectant drug products and in the final monograph for OTCskin protectant drug products.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) ``The United States Pharmacopeia, XXI_The National Formulary XVI,''United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD, p. 984, 1985.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Welsh, A.L., ``Powders,'' <T3>in</T3> ``The Dermatologist's Handbook,'' Charles C.

One comment requested that sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) be classifiedas a Category I skin protectant for drying the oozing and weeping of poisonivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, and for protecting and relieving theirritation associated with various skin problems, such as poison ivy andminor insect bites and stings. Referring to the tentative final monographfor OTC skin protectant drug products (48 FR 6820 at 6830), which discussedFDA's decision to transfer sodium bicarbonate from the rulemaking for OTCskin protectant drug products to the rulemaking for OTC external analgesicdrug products, the comment stated that baking soda should be consideredin both rulemakings. The comment expressed concern that sodium bicarbonatehad been placed in Category II as an insect bite neutralizer by the MiscellaneousExternal Panel in its statement on OTC insect bite neutralizer drug products,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 7, 1982 (47 FR 39448). The commentcontended that the ingredient was incorrectly categorized. The commentasked that the data on sodium bicarbonate previously submitted to the MiscellaneousExternal Panel (Ref. 1) and to the rulemakings for OTC skin protectantand external analgesic drug products (Refs. 2 through 5) be reconsideredas demonstrating that sodium bicarbonate has been used and marketed formany dermatological conditions, including for the relief, protection, andfor drying the oozing and weeping of poison ivy, poison oak, and poisonsumac, and for the relief of itching of poison ivy-oak-sumac and insectbites. The comment added that a survey (Ref. 1) indicates that many dermatologistsand other physicians routinely prescribe sodium bicarbonate for a widevariety of external drug uses, including, but not limited to, relief ofminor insect stings and bites.The comment noted that, although sodium bicarbonate has not been the subjectof double-blind clinical trials (a concept of relatively recent development,circa 1952), it has been used for a long time for its effectiveness inthe treatment of a variety of skin conditions (Ref. 6). The comment includeda ``dermatological summary of baking soda'' (sodium bicarbonate) (Ref.6) which contained references in the medical literature on the topicaluse of sodium bicarbonate (e.g., as a powder and in a bath) in a numberof dermatological conditions.The Topical Analgesic Panel classified sodium bicarbonate as safe and effectivefor use as a skin protectant (43 FR 34628 at 34640). That Panel concludedthat sodium bicarbonate is safe for use as a skin protectant with no ageor concentration limits. That Panel stated that sodium bicarbonate hasa long history of market acceptability, soothes irritated skin, and asa topical protectant is effective in the symptomatic relief of minor irritations,insect bites, and stings (43 FR 34640). That Panel stated that sodium bicarbonateis effective as a skin protectant due to its absorbent properties, butdid not include the ingredient in its table which categorized the purposes(i.e., for dryness, wetness, or lubricity) for which Category I skin protectantsare used (43 FR 34632).In the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products(48 FR 6820 at 6830), the agency stated that the Panel pointed out thatsodium bicarbonate is an effective antipruritic in relieving itching dueto nonpoisonous insect stings and bites, or due to sunburn, and that itis also used to relieve the pain of minor acid burns. Because the indication``for the temporary relief of pain and itching due to minor burns, sunburn,* * * insect bites, and minor skin irritations'' was being addressed inthe external analgesic rulemaking (December 4, 1979; 44 FR 69768), theagency transferred sodium bicarbonate to that rulemaking proceeding.Now that all of the information submitted on the uses of sodium bicarbonatehas been reviewed, the agency has determined that sodium bicarbonate shouldbe addressed in the skin protectant rulemaking, not in the external analgesicrulemaking. For reasons discussed below, the agency believes that claimsrelated to the ``relief of itching of poison ivy and insect bite'' forsodium bicarbonate should be considered under the skin protectant rulemaking.The agency has reviewed the data referred to by the comment (Refs. 1 through6), which include information on (1) the historical use of sodium bicarbonateas a paste for treatment of skin irritation, including insect bites andpoison ivy, (2) eye, skin, and oral toxicity data, which indicate thatsodium bicarbonate is relatively nontoxic, (3) a survey of dermatologistsand general practitioners in which it was concluded that one out of threeresponding dermatologists and one out of two responding general practitionershave used or recommended use of sodium bicarbonate for relief of insectbites, minor burns, and pruritis, and (4) efficacy data consisting of referencesindicating that sodium bicarbonate used as a paste, wet dressing, or ina tub bath provides relief of skin irritation and minor skin conditionssuch as mild itching, erythema, and insect bites, and because of its emollienteffect relieves skin irritation.The data show that alkaline baths (sodium bicarbonate) are useful in chronic,scaly dermatoses and urticaria, and help to soften the skin. However, forinsect bites and stings, first aid measures are not entirely effectivebecause the bite wound extends beneath the skin, although a paste madeof baking soda and cold cream provides some relief. The comment claimedthat sodium bicarbonate reduces pain by neutralizing the formic acid injectedby the insect.The agency agrees with the Topical Analgesic Panel that sodium bicarbonatecan be generally recognized as a safe and effective skin protectant (43FR 34628 at 34640). Additionally, the agency agrees with the Panel's statementin its report on skin protectant drug products that sodium bicarbonatehas antipruritic activity (43 FR 34640). Moreover, other information discussedabove indicates that sodium bicarbonate provides relief of itching (Refs.1 through 6). The Panel's discussion of sodium bicarbonate's antipruriticactivity concerned the ingredient's use as a skin protectant, not as anexternal analgesic. The relief of itching attributed to skin protectantswas based on the pharmacologic action of these drugs in providing a physicalor mechanical barrier to protect exposed skin surfaces from harmful orannoying stimuli (43 FR 34630). The pharmacological action of externalanalgesics is to depress or stimulate the cutaneous sensory receptors asa means of relieving the symptoms of pain and itching (44 FR 69768 at 69772).Thus, sodium bicarbonate's mechanism of action in relieving itching isbased on its use as a mechanical barrier (i.e., skin protectant), ratherthan on physiological or physiochemical factors (i.e., external analgesic).Therefore, the ``relief of itching'' claim for sodium bicarbonate is addressedin this rulemaking.Based on the available information, the agency believes that sodium bicarbonatecan be classified as a Category I skin protectant when labeled with thefollowing claim: ``Provides temporary skin protection and relieves minorirritation and itching due to poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, andinsect bites.'' However, the submitted data do not provide any informationon sodium bicarbonate's drying effect in conditions such as poison ivy,poison oak, and poison sumac; therefore, the indication ``Dries the oozingand weeping of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac'' is not beingproposed for sodium bicarbonate. Nor is there evidence to support the useof sodium bicarbonate as an insect bite neutralizer. Therefore, the agencyis retaining the Category II classification that was proposed for thisingredient as an insect bite neutralizer by the Miscellaneous ExternalPanel (47 FR 39436 at 39448).The Topical Analgesic Panel did not recommend any age or concentrationlimits for the use of sodium bicarbonate. The agency is not proposing anyconcentration limits for sodium bicarbonate in this amendment; however,it is including an age limitation. No data were provided on the use ofsodium bicarbonate on infants for the requested uses. The agency is awareof one report of an adverse reaction in a 4-month-old infant after treatmentof diaper rash with sodium bicarbonate (Ref. 7). The adverse reaction reportstates that liberal amounts of sodium bicarbonate and petrolatum had beenapplied to a severe diaper rash at every diaper change for more than aweek. The infant experienced hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis which theauthors attributed to excessive sodium bicarbonate absorption from thebaking soda that was applied to the diaper rash. The authors postulatedthat metabolic alkalosis occurred because the infant's immature renal systemwas not able to effectively excrete the excessive load of bicarbonate.The agency notes that a marketed product containing sodium bicarbonateprovides directions for emollient baths to relieve skin irritations (Ref.1). Regarding the use of sodium bicarbonate for such baths, the submission(Ref. 1) cites the Merck Manual (Ref. 8) as recommending that 8 ouncesof sodium bicarbonate be dissolved in about 30 gallons of warm water andthat the patient should remain in the bath for 10 to 30 minutes or longer.The skin should be patted dry rather than rubbed so that a thin film ofthe drug remains on the skin. Other submitted data (Ref. 6) indicated thatalthough there is variation regarding the recommended or optimal concentrationof sodium bicarbonate for baths and solutions, a range of 1 to 5 percentwould encompass most of the concentrations.The following directions are being proposed for sodium bicarbonate foruse as a skin protectant: ``Adults and children 2 years of age and over:Topical dosage is 1 to 100 percent sodium bicarbonate.(i) <T3>For use as a paste. </T3>Add sufficient water to the sodium bicarbonateto form a paste and apply to the affected area of the skin as needed. Childrenunder 2 years of age: Consult a doctor.(ii) <T3>For use as a soak in a tub. </T3>Dissolve 1 to 2 cupfuls of this productin a tub of warm water and soak for 10 to 30 minutes as needed. Do notrub dry, but instead pat dry so that a thin layer of the sodium bicarbonatewill be left on the skin. Children under 2 years of age: Consult a doctor.(iii) <T3>For use as a wet dressing. </T3>Add sodium bicarbonate to water tomake a solution. Use a container in which you can saturate a cloth. Saturatea clean, soft, white cloth (such as a diaper or torn sheet) in the solution,gently squeeze, and apply loosely to the affected area. Saturate the clothin the solution every 15 to 30 minutes and apply to the affected area.Repeat as often as necessary. Discard remaining solution after use.''The agency has considered the warnings proposed for skin protectants inandSection; 347.50(c) to determine which are applicable to sodium bicarbonate.In the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products(48 FR 6820 at 6830), a comment requested that sodium bicarbonate be exemptedfrom the general warning for skin protectants ``For external use only''because it is both a food and an antacid and, thus, this warning wouldconfuse consumers. The agency agrees that sodium bicarbonate can be exemptedfrom the warning ``For external use only.'' Further, the directions forusing the ingredient as a skin protectant clearly indicate that the productis for external use. The comment also requested that sodium bicarbonatebe exempted from the warning ``Avoid contact with the eyes.'' The commentcontended that the drug is nonirritating according to the Draize rabbiteye irritation test, and it is used in swimming pools and baths.The agency has reviewed the eye irritation study referred to by the comment(Ref. 1). Six rabbits were tested using sodium bicarbonate (0.086 grams)instilled into the right eye. All rabbits exhibited redness of the conjunctivabecause of sodium bicarbonate, and two exhibited a slight discharge. However,as stated by the comment, the drug would not be considered an eye irritantaccording to the standards prescribed in the Draize testing methodology.Although sodium bicarbonate is not considered an eye irritant, it causedredness of the eye in rabbits. Because any product that might be used onthe face could accidentally get into the eye and cause irritation, theagency believes that a general warning to avoid contact with the eyes isappropriate. Therefore, the warning is being retained for sodium bicarbonate.Thus, the following warnings proposed in andSection; 347.50(c) (1) and (2)are applicable to sodium bicarbonate: (1) ``Avoid contact with the eyes,''and (2) ``If condition worsens or does not improve within 7 days, consulta doctor.''The use of sodium bicarbonate for other skin protectant uses will be discussedin future issues of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volume 160032.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Comment C00027, Docket No. 78N-0021, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Comment C00050, Docket No. 78N-0021, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Comment C00047, Docket No. 78N-0301, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Comment C00085, Docket No. 78N-0301, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Eisenstat, B.A., ``Dermatological Summary of Baking Soda,'' unpublishedstudy, pp. 1-7, October 7, 1983, in OTC Volume 06PISTFM, Docket No. 78N-021P,Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Gonzalez, J., and R.J.

Two comments contended that limiting the statement of identity for differentskin protectant drug products to the one term ``skin protectant'' is toorestrictive, that other equally descriptive terms are appropriate, andthat other statements of identity should be allowed for such products.One comment stated that the statement of identity should reflect the modeof action and suggested that the term ``poison ivy and oak (dosage form)''be allowed for skin protectant drug products labeled for this use. Theother comment argued that because the tentative final monograph providesseparate and distinct indications for each group of skin protectant drugproducts, there should be equally separate and distinct statements of identityfor each group. According to the comment, the large diversity of appropriateindications justifies an equally diverse list of appropriate statementsof identity that would properly inform the consumer of the intended useof the product. The comment requested that additional statements of identitybe included in the skin protectant monograph and suggested such statementsas ``poison ivy, oak, sumac treatment,'' ``poison ivy, oak, sumac protectant,''and ``drying (dosage form)'' for ingredients proposed in andSection; 347.50(b)(3)and also for corn starch.The agency agrees with one comment that the term ``poison ivy, oak, sumactreatment'' is an appropriate statement of identity for skin protectantdrug products used for this purpose, including the ingredients colloidaloatmeal and sodium bicarbonate that are proposed for Category I statusin this document (see comments 1 and 3 above.). However, the agency doesnot find the statements ``poison ivy and oak (dosage form)'' and ``poisonivy, oak, sumac protectant'' to be as descriptive and informative to consumers.Further, the agency believes that the word ``protectant'' in the latterstatement is confusing and could be interpreted as protecting against poisonivy, oak, and sumac.In addition, the agency believes that while the statement ``drying (dosageform)'' describes the principal intended action of skin protectant drugproducts used for the proposed indication (``Dries the oozing and weepingof poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac''), it is too general if usedalone. If the concept of ``drying'' is combined with ``poison ivy, oak,and sumac,'' it would be an acceptable statement of identity. However,this statement of identity is not appropriate for the ingredients colloidaloatmeal and sodium bicarbonate, because the agency is not proposing thatthese ingredients be Category I for the indication ``Dries the oozing andweeping of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.'' (See comments 1and 3 above.) Accordingly, the agency is proposing that the statement ofidentity in andSection; 347.50(a) for skin protectant drug products usedto treat poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac be revised to read asfollows: ``(a) <T3>Statement of Identity.</T3> The labeling of the product contains theestablished names of the product, if any, and identifies the product withone or more of the following:(1) ``Skin protectant.''(2) <T3>For products containing any ingredient in andSection; 347.10 (b), (c),(g), (k), (l), or (m). </T3>``Poison ivy, oak, sumac drying'' (insert dosageform, e.g., ``cream,'' ``lotion,'' or ``ointment'').(3) <T3>For products containing any ingredient in andSection; 347.10 (b), (c),(g), (k), (l), (m), (t), or (u).</T3> ``Poison ivy, oak, sumac treatment.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Agency's Evaluation of the Submissions</ITAG>The Miscellaneous External Panel discussed only the use of OTC drug productsfor the prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac and foruse as insect bite neutralizers. The Panel recommended that the agencyconsider in appropriate rulemakings ingredients and labeling claims submittedfor treating poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and their related symptoms(47 FR 39436 at 39441).In this document, the agency discusses the use of OTC skin protectant drugproducts for the treatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poison oak,and poison sumac as well as for the treatment and/or neutralization ofinsect bites. The agency has evaluated a number of submissions (Ref. 1)that were not reviewed by the Panel. Some of the submissions include drugproducts that are no longer marketed or that have been reformulated toinclude active ingredients and/or conditions that were proposed in thetentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products (48 FR6820). The manufacturers of these drug products have requested that theirsubmissions or portions of their submissions concerning these drug productsbe withdrawn from further consideration in this rulemaking, as follows:1. Submissions (Ref. 2) concerning drug products containing stabilizedaloe vera for topical use for numerous indications including the symptomsof insect bites and poison ivy were withdrawn by the manufacturers (Refs.3 and 4).2. Submissions and portions of submissions (Ref. 5) concerning drug productscontaining zirconium oxide for the prevention and/or treatment of poisonivy, poison oak, and poison sumac were withdrawn by the manufacturers (Refs.6 and 7).<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volumes 160032, 160074, 160152, and 160186.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) OTC Volumes 160143, 160196, 160252, 160261, 160273, and 160274.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Letter from J.F.

One manufacturer submitted information to the Miscellaneous ExternalPanel requesting Category I status for a drug product containing 6 percentferric chloride solution labeled as an astringent ``for topical use onlyin prevention of ivy poisoning'' and as a ``preventative solution for poisonivy, poison oak, poison sumac'' (Refs. 1, 2, and 3).The Miscellaneous External Panel reviewed these submissions, but inadvertentlydid not cite one of them (Ref. 1) in its statement on OTC drug productsfor the prevention of poison ivy, oak, and sumac (47 FR 39412 at 39417and 39441). The agency has reviewed these submissions and determined thatthe volume not cited by the Panel contains only labeling for the manufacturer'sproducts and that one of the submissions that the Panel did review andcite (Ref. 2) contains all of the supporting information for the ferricchloride product.The Panel stated that the submissions contained no substantial data toestablish the safety and effectiveness of ferric chloride to prevent poisonivy, poison oak, or poison sumac and classified this ingredient in CategoryII (47 FR 39412 at 39417 and 39436 at 39441). No additional data have beensubmitted. The agency concurs with the Panel's determination that the manufacturer'ssubmissions do not contain substantial data in support of the safety oreffectiveness of ferric chloride and with the Panel's recommendation thatferric chloride be classified Category II for the prevention of poisonivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volume 160074.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) OTC Volume 160152.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) OTC Volume 160132.</ITAG>6. One submission (Ref. 1) contained a label for a spray product containingbenzalkonium chloride and polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymersas active ingredients claimed to be effective for the treatment of itchingand burning of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac and ``in reducingthe swelling and itching of insect bites, from chiggers, mosquitoes, bees,wasps, etc.''The submission did not contain any data to support the claims made forthese ingredients. Because no information has been submitted to the agencyon the safety and effectiveness of polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymers,the agency is classifying this ingredient in Category II in this rulemaking.The agency proposed a Category III classification for benzalkonium chlorideas a skin antiseptic and as a skin wound protectant in the tentative finalmonograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products (January 6, 1978;43 FR 1210 at 1229). This ingredient will be discussed further in the tentativefinal monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products in a futureissue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="74">Reference</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volume 160186.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">III. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions and Adoption of the Panel'sStatements</ITAG>A. Summary of Ingredient Categories and Testing of CategoryII and Category III Conditions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Summary of Ingredient Categories</ITAG>In the Miscellaneous External Panel's advance notice of proposed rulemakingfor skin protectant drug products (47 FR 39436 at 39440 and 39448), thePanel stated that, although the agency's call-for-data notices (38 FR 31697and 40 FR 38179) requested the submission of data and information for anumber of specific active ingredients (47 FR 39436 at 39440 and 39448)or any other active ingredients used in OTC poison ivy and oak remedy drugproducts and insect bites drug products, the Panel reviewed only thoseingredients with claims for preventing poison ivy, oak, or sumac or fortreating insect bites by neutralization or inactivation of insect venom.As stated above, drug products for treatment of the symptoms of poisonivy-oak-sumac and insect bites are discussed in the external analgesicrulemaking published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and will not be discussed further here.The Panel received submissions for products containing a buffered mixtureof cation and anion resins and for products containing ferric chloridethat claimed to prevent poison ivy, oak, or sumac by complexing with theplant antigen before it enters the skin. The agency concurs with the Panel'sdetermination that there are insufficient data to demonstrate the effectivenessof a buffered mixture of cation and anion resins in preventing poison ivy,poison oak, and poison sumac and agrees with the Panel's Category III classificationof these ingredients. In addition, the agency concurs with the Panel'sdetermination that there are no substantial data to support the safetyand effectiveness of ferric chloride and agrees with the Panel's CategoryII classification of this ingredient.The Panel also received submissions for products containing ammonium hydroxideand triethanolamine (trolamine) that claimed to neutralize or inactivateinsect venom. The agency concurs with the Panel's determination that thereare insufficient data to demonstrate the effectiveness of ammonium hydroxideand trolamine as insect bite neutralizers and concurs with the Panel'sCategory III classification of these ingredients.Although the Miscellaneous External Panel mentioned the use of skin protectantingredients for the prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac,and use as insect bite neutralizers, it did not review or classify allof the individual ingredients. Most of the ingredients in marketed productssubmitted to the Panel or ingredients that appeared in the call-for-datanotices were simply listed in the Panel's statements on OTC drug productsfor the prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac (47 FR 39436at 39440) and on OTC insect bite neutralizer drug products (47 FR 39448).The Panel noted at 47 FR 39440 that many of these ingredients labeled withclaims as skin protectant drug products for symptoms of oozing or weepingdue to contact dermatitis, poison ivy, or poison oak have been previouslyaddressed by another OTC panel, the Topical Analgesic Panel. The agencyhas further considered the recommendations of the Topical Analgesic Panelon OTC skin protectant drug products (43 FR 34628), the tentative finalmonograph on OTC skin protectant drug products (48 FR 6820), and the additionaldata and information available at this time. Based upon this information,the agency is adding several active ingredients to the ``Summary of IngredientCategories'' table for skin protectant active ingredients that appearedin the tentative final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products(48 FR 6820 at 6831). These ingredients are ammonium hydroxide, bufferedmixtures of cation and anion exchange resins, colloidal oatmeal, ferricchloride, polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymers, and trolamine.In addition, the agency is amending the entries for two ingredients thatwere listed as deferred and transferred to other rulemakings. These ingredients(corn starch and sodium bicarbonate) are now classified as skin protectantsin this rulemaking.

Except for theingredients listed in the table above, no information has been providedon any of the other ingredients in the Panel's list. Accordingly, all ofthose ingredients are considered Category II. The Miscellaneous External Panel also stated that it was not able to locatenor was it aware of data demonstrating the safety or effectiveness as OTCinsect bite neutralizers of a number of active ingredients listed in itsreport (47 FR 39436 at 39448) and recommended a Category II classificationfor these ingredients. The agency concurs with the Panel's Category IIclassification of these ingredients for use as insect bite neutralizers.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions </ITAG>The agency is not proposing specific testing guidelines in this document.Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submissionof data and information to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of anyskin protectant ingredient or conditions included in the review for thetreatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumacas well as for the treatment and/or neutralization of insect bites, byfollowing the procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740) and clarifiedApril 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). That policy statement includes proceduresfor the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings withindustry or other interested persons, and agency communications on submittedtest data and other information. B. Summary of the Agency's Changes FDA has considered comments submitted to the Topical Analgesic Panel andthe Miscellaneous External Panel, the submissions to the MiscellaneousExternal Panel, and other relevant information and concludes that it willtentatively adopt the substance of the Miscellaneous External Panel's statements.This Panel did not recommend a specific monograph for skin protectant drugproducts for use in the treatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poisonoak, and poison sumac or for the treatment and/or neutralization of insectbites. However, the Topical Analgesic Panel did recommend a monograph forskin protectant drug products (43 FR 34628), and the agency adopted thisrecommended monograph with some revisions in the tentative final monographfor OTC skin protectant drug products (48 FR 6820 at 6832). The agencyis amending the tentative final monograph to include conditions for thetreatment and/or prevention of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumacas well as for the treatment and/or neutralization of insect bites basedon its evaluations of the data and its responses to the comments describedabove, and the other changes described in the summary below. A summaryof the changes made by the agency follows. 1. The agency is proposing in andSection; 347.3(d) of this tentative finalmonograph the following definition for poison ivy, poison oak, or poisonsumac dermatitis: an allergic contact dermatitis (usually an intenselyitching skin rash) due to exposure to plants of the genus <T3>Rhus</T3> (poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac), which contain urushiol,a potent skin-sensitizing agent. 2. After reviewing all of the information submitted on the uses of sodiumbicarbonate, the agency has decided to address sodium bicarbonate in theskin protectant rulemaking, not in the external analgesic rulemaking. Althoughthe agency stated in the tentative final monograph for skin protectantdrug products (48 FR 6820 at 6830) that it would address this ingredientin the external analgesic rulemaking, the agency finds that, because ofits mechanism of action in relieving itching, i.e., its ability to forma mechanical barrier, it is appropriate to address sodium bicarbonate inthe skin protectant rulemaking. (See comment 3 above.)3. Based on the agency's review of data on colloidal oatmeal and the availableinformation on sodium bicarbonate, the agency is revising the tentativefinal monograph to include these two ingredients as Category I skin protectantdrug products and is proposing the following indication for these two ingredientsin andSection;347.50(b)(4): ``Provides temporary skin protection and relievesminor irritation and itching due to poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac,and insect bites.'' However, for colloidal oatmeal, the agency states thatsufficient data on the composition and concentration of the different constituentsof this ingredient need to be established before it can be included inthe final monograph. (See comments 1 and 3 above.) 4. The agency has added letter designations in andSection;347.10 <T3>Skin protectant active ingredients </T3>to include the addition ofthe ingredients colloidal oatmeal in paragraph (t) and sodium bicarbonatein paragraph (u). The agency has added these letter designations for thesetwo active ingredients in appropriate paragraphs of andSection;347.50. 5. The agency is proposing to revise the statement of identity in andSection;347.50(a)to read as follows: (a) <T3>Statement of identity. </T3>The labeling of the product contains theestablished name of the drug, if any, and identifies the product with oneor more of the following: (1) ``Skin protectant.'' (2) <T3>For products containing any ingredient in andSection;347.10 (b), (c),(g), (k), (l), or (m). </T3>``Poison ivy, oak, sumac drying'' (insert dosageform, e.g., ``cream,'' ``lotion,'' or ``ointment''). (3) <T3>For products containing any ingredient in andSection;347.10 (b), (c),(g), (k), (l), (m), (t), or (u). </T3>``Poison ivy, oak, sumac treatment.''(See comment 4 above.) As noted above, an OTC skin protectant drug product may be labeled forone or more uses. Other uses for skin protectant active ingredients willbe added to this monograph in the future, e.g., claims for the treatmentand prevention of diaper rash. When the labeling of the product containsmore than one labeled use, it must contain the appropriate statement(s)of identity, indications, warnings, and directions for each labeled use.For multiple use skin protectant drug products, the labeling appropriateto different uses may be combined to eliminate duplicate words and phrasesso that the resulting information is clear and understandable. Introductorytext to andSection;347.50 has been added in this amendment to reflect theabove labeling requirements. 6. The agency is proposing that the warning in andSection;347.50(c)(1) ``Forexternal use only'' not be required for sodium bicarbonate because thisingredient can be used orally for other purposes. (See comment 3 above.)7. Because colloidal oatmeal can be slippery in a tub of water, the agencyis proposing a warning in andSection;347.50(c)(9) when colloidal oatmealis labeled for use as a soak in a tub, to read ``Take special care to avoidslipping when getting into and out of the tub.'' (See comment 1 above.)8. The agency is proposing directions in andSection;347.50(d)(2) for theuse of colloidal oatmeal as a skin protectant, to read ``Adults and children2 years of age and over: <T3>For use as a soak in a tub. </T3>Turn tub warm water faucet on to fullforce, then slowly sprinkle 1 cupful of colloidal oatmeal directly underthe faucet into the tub. Before entering the tub, stir any colloidal oatmealthat may have settled to the bottom of the tub. Soak the affected areafor 15 to 20 minutes as needed. Do not rub area dry, but instead pat dryso that a thin layer of the colloidal oatmeal will be left on the skin.Soak once or twice daily, or as directed by your doctor. Children under2 years of age: Consult a doctor.'' (See comment 1 above.) 9. The agency is proposing directions in andSection; 347.50(d)(3) for theuse of sodium bicarbonate as a skin protectant, to read ``Adults and children2 years of age and over: Topical dosage is 1 to 100 percent sodium bicarbonate.(i) <T3>For use as a paste. </T3>Add sufficient water to the sodium bicarbonateto form a paste and apply to the affected area of the skin as needed. Childrenunder 2 years of age: Consult a doctor. (ii) <T3>For use as a soak in a tub. </T3>Dissolve 1 to 2 cupfuls of this productin a tub of warm water and soak for 10 to 30 minutes as needed. Do notrub dry, but instead pat dry so that a thin layer of the sodium bicarbonatewill be left on the skin. Children under 2 years of age: Consult a doctor.''(See comment 3 above.)   (iii) <T3>For use as a wet dressing. </T3>Add sodium bicarbonate to water tomake a solution. Use a container in which you can saturate a cloth. Saturatea clean, soft, white cloth (such as a diaper or torn sheet) in the solution,gently squeeze, and apply loosely to the affected area. Saturate the clothin the solution every 15 to 30 minutes and apply to the affected area.Repeat as often as necessary. Discard remaining solution after use. The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemakingin conjunction with other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. Ina notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat not one of these rules, including this proposed rule for OTC skinprotectant drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of poisonivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, as well as for the treatment and/orneutralization of insect bites is a major rule. The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354). That assessment included a discretionary Regulation FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC skin protectant drug products for the treatment and/or preventionof poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac as well as the treatment and/orneutralization of insect bites is not expected to pose such an impact onsmall businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule,if implemented, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The agency invited public comment in the advance notice of proposed rulemakingregarding any impact that this rulemaking would have on OTC skin protectantdrug products. No comments on economic impacts were received. Any commentson the agency's initial determination of the economic consequences of thisproposed rulemaking should be submitted by January 31, 1990. The agencywill evaluate any comments and supporting data that are received and willreassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to thefinal rule. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required. Interested persons may, on or before January 31, 1990, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments, objections, or requestsfor oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. Arequest for an oral hearing must specify points to be covered and timerequested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determinationmay be submitted on or before January 31, 1990. Three copies of all comments,objections, and requests are to be submitted, except that individuals maysubmit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identifiedwith the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this documentand may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Comments, objections,and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday. Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Interested persons, on or before October 3, 1990, may also submit in writingnew data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of those conditionsnot classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submittedon or before December 3, 1990. These dates are consistent with the timeperiods specified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural regulationsfor reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copiesof all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified withthe docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Dataand comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch. Receiveddata and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and4 p.m., Monday through Friday. In establishing a final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products,the agency will ordinarily consider only data submitted prior to the closingof the administrative record on December 3, 1990. Data submitted afterthe closing of the administrative record will be reviewed by the agencyonly after a final monograph is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, unless the Commissioner finds good cause hasbeen shown that warrants earlier consideration. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 347 </ITAG>Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Skin protectant drug products.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the AdministrativeProcedure Act, it is proposed that subchapter D of chapter I of title 21of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended in Part 347 as proposed inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6820) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 347_SKIN PROTECTANT DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER HUMANUSE </ITAG>1.
