When Mr. Andreev heard about Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's plans to double many basic food prices, his response was typical of many Soviets.    &quot;I knew it was coming,&quot; he says, looking away from the busy road that rings Moscow and showing his passenger the displeasure in his eyes. &quot;I've had it up to here,&quot; he says, drawing a finger across his neck.    Mr. Gorbachev has been selling his program for economic and social renewal on the promise of a better life. Western experts say the planned price increases and other measures, which in the view of workers contradict that promise, could spark a credibility crisis -- and even some scattered unrest -- dousing grass-roots support for Mr. Gorbachev's reform drive.    To help buy political stability among the working class, the Kremlin for decades has used huge state subsidies to keep the price of many food staples low. Now the Kremlin plans first to abolish subsidies on meat and dairy products -- totaling 60 billion rubles annually ($100 billion at the officially set exchange rate) -- and then to balance other retail food prices with the cost of food from state farms.    While an official announcement on ending the subsidies hasn't been made, senior Soviet officials, in recent interviews, confirmed plans to do so. Soviet workers, who are skilled at reading between the lines, know about the coming price increases from discussions in the official media.    The plan to double the cost of meat, milk, butter and cheese follows other decisions that have sparked noticeable public anger. To cut vodka consumption in the battle against alcoholism, a liter bottle -- a treasured solace for many Russians -- was more than doubled in price to 15 rubles, or about one-tenth of the average worker's monthly pay. Production was curbed, and half the liquor stores were closed, increasing the average wait in line to three hours.    Mr. Gorbachev has instituted three shifts in many workplaces, upsetting many people's lives. Further, stringent new quality standards have been instituted that have cut many workers' salaries by as much as 25% for failure to produce salable goods. This has lead to demonstrations at some factories, including the Kama River truck plant, the Soviet Union's largest diesel-engine plant.    To make the price increases less painful, Soviet officials are promising simultaneous measures to compensate consumers. Vladimir Chaplanov, who heads the State Committee department responsible for working out those measures, recently told a radio interviewer that any rise in food prices would be accompanied by a balanced increase in wages, pensions and student stipends. He also said the cost of some manufactured goods, such as clothing, would come down. Leonid Abalkin, director of the Institute of Economics and a close aide to Mr. Gorbachev, conceded in an interview that serious consequences might arise if this wasn't done.    Food shortages are a widespread and persistent problem in the Soviet Union, and reports of isolated demonstrations when there isn't enough to go around occasionally trickle into Moscow from provincial cities. But Western experts aren't predicting large-scale public turmoil after the price boosts. The unrest involving the Solidarity trade union in Poland got its start when meat prices were raised, but the Soviet population is generally less volatile.    Western officials say the greater threat to Mr. Gorbachev, whose pronouncements on the need to raise living standards outnumber those on any other subject, is a loss of credibility among a populace that suffers from deep-seated cynicism toward official promises and that can torpedo the reforms by passive resistance.    &quot;The only way we can build up reform momentum is if our people see a radical increase in their standard of living, an increase of several times over,&quot; says Fyodor Burlatsky, chief political commentator for the newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta and widely regarded as a confidant of the Soviet leader.    Underlining the tough dilemma Mr. Gorbachev faces as he struggles to make the centrally planned economy more efficient, Mr. Abalkin says that, although it is bound to be unpopular, the price increase &quot;can be considered a scientifically proven necessity.&quot; He stresses that the state can't any longer afford the food subsidies and says that the artificially low prices are causing &quot;severe distortions in supply and demand.&quot;    Like other Soviet officials, Mr. Abalkin insists the changes will come only after what he calls &quot;a national public discussion for the formation of public opinion,&quot; which he expects to be completed in less than a year. Many Soviet intellectuals describe the &quot;discussion&quot; as a propaganda campaign and say that popular backing for the changes is far from guaranteed.    Many Russians aren't convinced that their incomes will rise at the same time that prices go up, as promised. Says Sergei, an agricultural chemist who asks that his last name not be used, &quot;They're very cunning. They will do these things but the result will be mostly cosmetic.&quot;    To give wider importance to the price rises, the state-run media are depicting the increases as the first stage in an urgently needed overhaul of the centrally controlled pricing system. But though the pricing overhaul is the linchpin of Mr. Gorbachev's drive to make the economy more efficient, the intricacies of pricing policy are of little concern to the average Russian.    The most commonly used official argument for abolishing food subsidies, predictably garbed in ideological clothing, is that it serves &quot;social justice,&quot; that is, the subsidies most benefit people who can afford more food, not average workers.    Abel Aganbegyan, head of the Academy of Sciences' economic branch and the Kremlin's chief economic adviser, said in an interview, &quot;Beef sells for two rubles a kilo, but it costs the state four to produce. If someone buys five kilos, look at the gift they get. Is that social justice?&quot;    Economist R. Grinberg, writing in Literaturnaya Gazeta, rejects this argument. &quot;A rise in food costs would lead to a fall in the level of consumption of the least well-off population groups,&quot; he says. In a comment reflecting the situation of Stanislav the taxi driver, Mr. Grinberg adds: &quot;It mustn't be forgotten that 40% of families in our country have a monthly income of less than 100 rubles per person.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
