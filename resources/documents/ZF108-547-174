(Ben Rosen)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gilder, George; Rosen, Ben.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Esther  Dyson, EDventure Holdings: Good evening.andP;  Okay, folks, welcome to theBenediction-of-Ben Dinner.andP;  Everybody's doing these decade things, and it'sbeenandM;ten years since Ben founded  Rosen Research in January 1980.andP;  1 decided itwould be really wonderful to have a dinner honoring Ben - if you've got afamous founder, flaunt it! - and have all these people pay their respects tohim.andM;We've brought the family here to honor him.andP;  Our first speaker is GeorgeGilder, who did our semiconductor coverage for the &quot;  Rosen ElectronicsLetter&quot; - as it was at the time - after Ben left.andP;  He called the office andsaid, &quot;I'd like a couple of back issues because I'm doing a book on thesemiconductor business.&quot;andM;I said, &quot;Fine, on condition you come by so I can meet you.&quot; And that's whenthe idea arose.andM;When I retold this to George a couple of weeks ago while I was writing thelast newsletter, he said, &quot;No, that wasn't the way it was at all.andP;  I had metBen earlier, and he asked me to write for the newsletter.&quot; So in the spiritof failing memory...andM;[Laughter]andM;We're going to have George introduce Ben with a short talk and then Ben -instead of being roasted - is going to roast some of his friends.andP;  I hopeyou'll all join me in wishing Ben a happy tenth anniversary and the industryanother new decade.andM;George Gilder: Thank you,  Esther.andP;  I won't correct your memory right away,but as I proceed you win be able to detect my editorial changes.andM;[Laughter]andM;When I first ran into Ben, I thought he was a writer.andP;  Not just any writer -the only one who could explain the mysteries of microcode, DRAM, refreshcycles and could also balance a chair on his chin.andP;  I understand he was at itagain last night: He balanced a rose on his nose, and then a chair on hischin.andM;[Laughter]andM;If you ask me, Ben clearly is ready for the new age of multimedia.andM;[Laughter]andM;But more than that, Ben was a writer whose works were good enough to steal.andO;This was a time when I was preparing a book on Silicon Valley and I'd go fromone office to another around the Valley.andP;  In every one I'd go to - from BobNoyce to Andy Grove to Charlie Sporck and whoever - I'd pretend I was chieflyinterested in what they had to say rather than in their pile of  RosenElectronics Letters in the corner.andP;  Whenever they turned their backs, I wouldsneak over, take them, run to the Xerox machine and copy as many as I could.andM;[Laughter]andM;After a while I decided this didn't pay, so I would try to get them at thesource.andP;  I went and tried to steal them in bulk.andM;[Laughter]andM;I went to the Pan Am building to Ben's office and asked him for asubscription.andP;  He said, no, he couldn't give out a free subscription.andP;  Butwould I write it?andM;[Laughter]andM;At the time I was just learning the semiconductor industry, so I gulped andleft the office somewhat chagrined, but he told me to call  Esther  Dyson ifI was interested.andP;  A little while later I called  Esther and then her storywent as I said.andP;  I spent a year writing the semiconductor sections of Release1.0, which was how I've learned the industry.andP;  There's nothing like writingseven or eight pages of copy on deadline on an industry week after week.andM;Ben was a superb writer - I think he was the first to use &quot;Thanks for theMemories&quot; as the tide of a DRAM piece.andP;  Since then, it's been obligatory.andO;But he turned out to be a writer like Clark Kent was a writer.andM;[Laughter]andM;Mild-mannered, soft-spoken, bespectacled, he would step into a phone boothand quick as 1-2-3, he emerged as SuperBen, the Venture Capital Tycoon.andM;[Laughter]andM;Ben told me not to overdo it tonight, so I'll have to be careful on this nextsection.andP;  But in a sense he became the Vladimir Lenin of the personalcomputer revolution.andM;[Laughter]andM;A revolution that history will record as incomparably more important thananything that happened in the Soviet Union in 1918.andP;  A culture is alwaysinclined to accord excessive importance to the actions of politicians, ascompared with the actions of entrepreneurs and innovators.andP;  But it's reallythe innovators and entrepreneurs who move history and change the world.andM;This personal computer era has been an amazing one, but what many peopledon't understand is how totally unexpected it was.andP;  Consider the situation in1980 when Ben was still scrivening away on the Morgan Stanley ElectronicsLetter.andP;  US companies dominated the world computer industry, but the revenueswere almost all from IBM and The Bunch: Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data,Honeywell.andM;During the 1980s all these companies steadily lost market share.andP;  In otherwords, all the companies on which America's dominance in the computerindustry depended in 1980 lost market share through most of that decade.andO;Nonetheless, here we are in 1990 and the US computer industry still commandsabout 70 percent market share in the global industry.andP;  Including software,it's probably gaining share today.andP;  It's really a stunning and amazingachievement.andP;  During this period the computer industry increased revenuesabout five-fold and increased 100,000-fold the cost-effectiveness of itshardware.andP;  Despite this complete transformation of the industry, the USstayed in the lead.andM;How did it happen? It was largely the work of our Clark Kent here with alittle help from his friends like L.J.andP;  Being the mediator between thecapital markets and the innovators in the economy, the first key thing he didwas to introduce Apple to Morgan Stanley.andP;  Morgan Stanley took Apple public.andO;Then he helped launch Lotus, Compaq, Cyprus, Convex, and even Osborne.andM;[Laughter]andM;That's not entirely a joke, since Osborne must have contributed heavily tothe formation of Compaq, which became the fastest-growing company in thehistory of the industry.andP;  Anyway, it was a true revolution that was effectedby Ben and Ids friends.andP;  In 1977 virtually 100 percent of the MIPS in theworld were controlled by mainframes with dumb terminals attached.andM;Ten years later in 1987, less than I percent of the MIPS in the world wascommanded by large computers with dumb terminals attached.andP;  Ben's companiesspearheaded this change.andP;  After Apple, Compaq became the fastest-growingindustrial start-up.andP;  Then it gave forth with Conner Peripherals.andP;  With alittle help from Compaq, Conner apparently has exceeded Compaq's pace.andO;Convex is the world leader in the minisupercomputer industry, and the US hasa 100 percent market share in that important new domain.andM;Compaq and Conner offer the US the best hope of continuing its leadership aswe move into the laptop and notebook-computer era, and as servers cut intothe mainframe and mini business.andP;  It's a thrilling industry, with thrillingopportunities, but Wall Street today is almost entirely blind to itspotential.andP;  We need a new Ben  Rosen to do on the hardware side what  Estherdoes so superbly on the software side.andM;Blow away TV with multimediaandM;This year US microcomputer and microchip companies have P/E ratios well belowthe Dow Jones Industrials.andP;  Despite this, the situation today is objectivelyfar more promising than it was ten years ago.andP;  In 1980, the mainframeestablishment with its dumb terminals was vulnerable to overthrow by arevolutionary personal computer industry.andP;  Today's counterpart of themainframe is the television broadcast industry.andP;  But the TV industry doesn'teven have dumb terminals attached; it has idiot boxes.andM;[Laughter]andM;The key goal and the great challenge of the next decade is to blow away theTV with multimedia pcs interconnected by fiber-optic cables.andP;  I think it canbe done in the 1990s.andM;[Applause]andM;It's estimated the transistors on a chip win rise to about a billion.andP;  That'sequivalent - provided Danny Hillis can show you how to organize them inparallel arrays - to about 20 Cray 2 supercomputers on one chip; this isabout a million-fold rise in the potential cost-effectiveness of computinghardware.andM;Contrary to what we heard this morning, I don't see any flattening orconsolidation when I look at the industry.andP;  The 1990s will make the  80s looktame.andM;So thanks for the memories, Ben.andP;  Thanks for the company, which  Esthercarries on.andP;  And thanks for all the companies that will make this new decademore thrilling by far than the last one !andP;  [Applause]andM;Ben of the BenedictionandM;Ben  Rosen,  Sevin  Rosen Management: I'd like to thank you too, George.andP;  Idon't know how many of you know George in his other manifestation, but GeorgeGilder has been prominent in the national marketplace for a long time.andO;Starting most prominently with his book &quot;Wealth and Poverty,&quot; which caughtthe attention of Ronald Reagan and helped catalyze the conservative movementin the country - for better or worse....andM;[LaughterlandM;It had a tremendous amount of influence.andP;  Whatever our polities, we owe adebt of gratitude to George because George has been fighting a war in thelast couple of years in favor of entrepreneurship.andP;  There is a movementagainst it which has been growing, led largely - John  Doerr says and Iconcur by Charles Ferguson of MIT.andP;  Both George and I have debated CharlesFerguson.andP;  George does it on a weekly basis, and has written opposing essaysin the Harvard Business Review and other publications.andP;  Both men have writtenor are writing books about his respective positions.andP;  Ferguson contendsentrepreneurship is the disease of America, the thing that is weakening us inour international competitiveness, and must be stamped out.andM;[Laughter]andM;George is carrying the cudgels of entrepreneurship.andM;[Applause]andM;It really is a fascinating debate to watch.andP;  George is doing a terrific jobshowing what entrepreneurship has done in this country in terms ofinnovation, productivity, job creation and international competitiveness.andO;Almost aH the innovation in the computer industry in the last 30 years hascome from venture-backed, technology-based entrepreneurial companies: themicroprocessor from intel; the personal computer and its software from a hostof entrepreneurial companies; the super-computer from Cray; theminisupercomputer from Convex; the workstation from Apollo and Sun; and onand on.andM;The case is well-founded, and we have an eloquent spokesman in George.andP;  Butwe come here not to praise George, but to praise me.andM;[Laughter and applause]andM;Actually we're skating on thin ice; I have no idea what's going to happen orhow this is going to turn out.andP;  Esther said, &quot;Why don't you do something?&quot; Sohere goes.andM;Personal computers introduced interactivity to computation, so we're going tomake this an interactive session.andP;  However this turns out - as a roast or aBen Benediction - I feel a bit awkward since  Esther asked me to host thisshow myself.andM;[Laughter]andM;I know of only one way to begin it: &quot;That Ben  Rosen, what a terrific guy!&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Isn't that how all roasts begin? We go downhill from here.andM;Esther had the chronology in the current letter; which was it, the January33rd issue? That's an interesting dating which I think I pioneered.andM;The first Forum was not on personal computers.andP;  It was on semiconductors in1971 in New York City.andP;  After a pause of a few years, they were held annuallyfor every year thereafter for about 15 years.andP;  The first Personal ComputerForum was in New York City at the St. Regis Hotel - the now-defunct St. RegisSheraton Hotel - and I think there were 50 people there.andP;  Esther thinks therewere 200; anyway, it was a smaller crowd than this who also paid much lessthan you're paying.andM;[Laughter]andM;Among those figures were such luminaries as Mike Markkula, who was then CEOand vice president of marketing of Apple; Chuck Peddle of Commodore; LewKornfeld who was running Radio Shack under Charles Tandy; and Rich Melmon whowas the marketing vp of a personal computer company called Umtech VideoBrain.andM;[Laughter]andM;Originally it was called Umtech, and Rich's greatest triumph as marketingmanager was to convince the founders that Umtech really wasn't a euphoniousname.andP;  He won the battle, but he lost the war.andM;[Laughter]andM;Regis McKenna, as only Regis could do, represented both companies in publicrelations.andM;[Laughter]andM;Finally Mike Markkula went to Regis and said,  Regis, you've got to decide.andO;We're competitors.andP;  You've got to choose.andP;  &quot; Believe it or not, Regis had ahard time deciding.andM;[Laughter]andM;Almost.andM;[Laughter]andM;Should I take Apple? Who would pick a company named after a fruit? Or shouldI take Umtech Video Brain? He resigned from Umtech Video Brain and signed onwith Apple as their public relations and advertising counsel.andM;After that there were a lot of conferences.andP;  In 1979 and 1980, the PC Forumswere held in New Orleans, my hometown.andP;  Thomas Wolfe was wrong: You can gohome again.andM;In all the questionnaires I had given out, never had I had such a polarizedresponse to the question, &quot;What do you think of this site?&quot; Half therespondents said,  &quot;What a wonderful city; make New Orleans the personal homeof the PC Forum.&quot; The other half said, &quot;Don't ever hold a conference in thisdump again.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;The next year we moved it to a more elegant setting: the Playboy Club in LakeGeneva, Wisconsin.andP;  But the feminist movement was gathering steam then and wehad to deBunny the Playboy Club.andP;  The majority of the audience came expectingall of these scantily clad Bunnies and there were none.andM;The next two years we held it in Palm Springs.andP;  Then  Esther took over invarious locations in the desert and in Florida.andM;One other quick set of historical notes.andP;  The Electronics Letter began onNovember 29, 1973, at a small firm called Coleman and Company where I was fora couple of years before I moved to Morgan Stanley in 1975.andP;  It startedbecause I was bored as a securities analyst.andP;  You have to write the sameturgid prose week after week about why the earnings of all these companiesare 2 cents above expectations or in some cases, $5 below.andM;[Laughter]andM;It gave me a mechanism to be a little more free-form in my writing.andP;  Icontinued that at Morgan Stanley and then left in January 1980 to start Rosen Research.andP;  In 1981, 1 started a venture capital firm.andP;  As  Esther hasindicated and some of you have noted - including Bill Gates and Fortune - Benhad a conflict of interest.andM;I had to look around for a buyer.andP;  I talked to McGraw-Hill; I talked to PatMcGovern.andP;  Esther raised her hand and said,  I'll buy it.&quot; I said, &quot;  Esther,what are you going to buy it with?&quot; She said, &quot;I'll buy it with the assets ofthe firm.&quot; And that's how the first LBOs started in America.andM;[Laughter]andM;The letter was known for many things.andP;  We tried to provide a service to anindustry that's rapidly changing.andP;  Sometimes you have to find new units; theLetter defined one of these as the unit of BS per second, known as the Rosen.andM;[Laughter]andM;It's such a gigantic quantity one normally thinks in terms of micro  Rosensor pico  Rosens.andM;I was the first to scoop the industry in industry mergers.andP;  We were the firstto note the impending merger of Yellow Freight Lines, Outboard Marine andSchlumberger into Yellow Schlumbmarine Corporation.andM;[Laughter]andM;A new ventureandM;That's what caused me to move into venture capital in 1981.andP;  My partner L.J.andO;Sevin and I thought we were going to kill 'em.andP;  He was a successfulentrepreneur, had raised venture capital, started a company and sold it atthe peak of the semi market to an unsuspecting United Technologies.andP;  I hadhad a successful career as a securities analyst and said, &quot;Boy, this lookslike a license to steal.&quot; We talked to some investment bankers and we settledon L.F.andP;  Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin.andP;  RIP.andP;  Tom Unterberg said, &quot;We'll getyou between $30 and $100 million.&quot; We said, &quot;Well, we're conservative.andP;  We'lltry for $30 minion.&quot;andM;For six months, we literally scoured the earth - all the United States andEurope - and after six months we had raised only $25 million.andP;  We said,&quot;That's it.andP;  We're going to go with $25 million.&quot; It was tough to raisemoney, particularly if none of the principals had been in venture capitalbefore.andM;But we gathered interesting anecdotes along the way.andP;  One of the mostmemorable is that Rothschild had an office in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, aprincipality of 25,000 people, with a lot of plunder collected over theyears.andP;  We made our pitch to the crown prince, who does a lot of investing.andM;After listening to us for an hour, he said, &quot;I won't invest in your venturefirm, but I'll give you a tour of the castle.&quot; We got a wonderful tour.andP;  It'sa spectacular castle with one of the largest art collections and greatestarmor collections in the world.andP;  We saw the guillotines they used to cut theheads of subjects.andM;Anyhow, we started our venture firm in 1981, and the first two investments wemade were in Synapse Computer and as George Gilder proclaimed, OsborneComputer.andP;  But these weren't our deals; we were in the second round, George.andM;[Laughter]andM;Nonetheless it was clear shortly thereafter that those things weren't goingto be winners.andP;  We had product problems in one case; management problems inthe other.andP;  So L.J.andP;  and I regrouped toward the end of 1981.andP;  We said, &quot;Gee,people didn't give us $25 million to invest in potentially bankruptcompanies.andP;  We're going to set a new policy.andP;  We're only going to invest instrong entrepreneurs with a good business background and in companies withsound business management and specific, defensible business plans.&quot;andM;Shortly after that I got a call from a friend I'd known for three years,Mitch  Kapor.andP;  Mitch said, &quot;Ben, 1'rh thinking of starting a company; wouldyou like to talk?&quot; I said, &quot;Sure.&quot; I called L.J.andP;  and said, &quot;Guess what? Ijust got a call from a fellow I've known for several years, and he wants tostart a software company.&quot; L.J.andP;  said, &quot;That's terrific; software is one ofthe things we're interested in.andP;  Does he meet our criteria?&quot; I said,  Well,he's written a couple of programs.&quot; He said, &quot;What's his other background?&quot; Ianswered, &quot;He's taught transcendental meditation.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;&quot;He's been a successful disk jockey.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;And he was an orderly in a mental-health hospital.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Despite that sterling background and that he didn't quite meet our newstandard, we invested in what became Lotus Development Corporation.andP;  In thatsame conversation, L.J.andP;  said, &quot;By coincidence I just got a call from threefellows leaving TI.andP;  They want to start a pc hardware company.&quot; I said,&quot;Terrific.andP;  That's also in our charter.andP;  I assume they have a clear businessvision?&quot;andM;Absolutely,&quot; he said.andP;  I said, &quot;I assume because the personal computerindustry is so competitive they have a new strategy.&quot; He said,  Not exactly.&quot;andO;I said, &quot;What do you mean, not exactly? What's their strategy?&quot; He said,&quot;Their strategy's simple: They want to compete head-on with IBM.&quot;andM;This goes to show you can have no rules and fail, and you can have specificrules, not adhere to them and succeed.andP;  So much for venture capital.andM;I don't know whether this is going to be a roast.andP;  More likely an interactivereminiscence with some of you - faulty memories and all.andP;  As someone past theage of 50, 1 can tell you  Esther, as I did at our conference in 1983, thememory is the second thing to 90.andM;[Laughter]andM;Groupware takes a turnandM;I'm taking the liberty of asking a few of you to come up and reminisce.andP;  Asthey said at the end of &quot;Tea and Sympathy,&quot; please be gentle.andM;Seymour Merrin, are you in the audience? Where's Sy? Seymour is known byeveryone in the personal computer industry.andP;  He was here at the beginning.andO;In the early '80s, Newsweek called him one of the superdealers in America.andO;He had a store called Computerworks, which he sold to all the majorcorporations.andM;[Laughter]andM;I'm just checking your memory.andP;  You're going to have to draw things out ofhim because above all Sy is shy and afraid to proffer an opinion.andP;  So helphim out.andP;  Seymour?andM;[Applause]andM;Seymour Merrin, Merrin Informtion Services: Being older than Ben my memoryunfortunately may be not as good as his.andP;  But not long ago when I was sittingtalking to my wife, it struck me that my first meeting with him was longbefore he was even interested in personal computers.andM;I was working for Exxon Enterprises -it later became Exxon Office Systems -and I was involved in the start-up of a company called Zilog.andP;  Ben was veryinterested, and since his offices were downstairs in the same building heused to come up and talk to the people directly involved.andP;  Then he became adealer.andM;Honest to God, one day - this had to be late 1975, 1976 - he came up with aproduct that I thought would be  a great present for my wife.andP;  He said, &quot;I'vegot a bunch of them downstairs.&quot; I went down to his office and bought one.andO;It was a Mickey Mouse five-function calculator with a nice handle.andP;  There wasthis big pile on his desk.andP;  So help me God, he was selling them.andP;  That washis first entrepreneurial venture that I remember, Ben.andP;  Remember that?andM;[Laughter]andM;My real reminiscence is that after I started my store, I tried to sell himstuff.andP;  One day Ben called me and said he had this great idea.andP;  Would I comeby and have lunch? I went down to New York and talked to him.andP;  He showed methese fancy water-color pictures and explained this nice footprint-type thingwhich really didn't turn me on at aH.andP;  We ate lunch and I gave him a longlaundry fist of why as a dealer I didn't think the thing would ever sell.andP;  Iwent home,thought some more and called him the next morning with a biggerlaundry list of why I was sure it wouldn't sell.andM;That was Gateway Computer.andP;  Later they changed the name to Compaq.andP;  But thereal fun of the story is that the PC Forum was about three weeks later.andP;  Bensaid, &quot;Talk to this guy Rod anyway.&quot; I talked to Rod who was there with thesame pictures, but he explained them differently.andP;  When he got through, Iwent back to Ben and said, &quot;I think this thing just might work.&quot; With that, Ileave.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: I'd like to call on another early acquaintance of mine through myvarious careers, Chuck Peddle.andP;  Chuck is multi-faceted - the designer of oneof the most popular microprocessor families, the 6502, and perhaps theearliest personal computer developer with the Commodore PET which came out inmid-1977.andM;Harry Saal, Network General: One ofandM;Rosen: One of the first, Harry, and a long-time friend - Chuck Peddle.andM;[Applause]andM;Charles J. Peddle, THStyme: Ben said it had to be funny but I don't know how,so you're going to have to put up with just dull.andM;[Laughter]andM;I'd like to propose that we come up with a term for Ben tonight.andP;  I'd like toname Ben &quot;the mother of the personal computer.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Several of us have claimed the tide &quot;father of the personal computer,&quot; and wehave to remember what fathers do.andP;  They have lots of fun during conception,and if the kid does well they claim it - like Joe Montana's father.andP;  Right?andM;[Laughter]andM;There are lots of fathers.andP;  What mothers do is handle the in-between.andP;  Theygive birth to kids and make them grow up and nurture 'em.andM;In 1977, 1 went to New York and met with a bunch of financial people.andP;  I wastrying to explain what a personal computer was, and I quoted Edison talkingabout electricity: He said, &quot;What good is a baby?&quot;andM;This baby has grown up enough so that today a guy from Olivetti who wassupposed to throw us out of that business admitted we kicked Ids butt.andP;  Thepoint is that in 1977 the financial community didn't believe, didn't evenunderstand! Some of us finally got them to understand that we might competewith computer companies in office products and consumer electronics.andP;  Theydecided we would definitely fail.andP;  Companies like APF or TI were going tokill our ass in personal computers and consumer electronics, and companieslike Computer Automation, Apollo and Prime were going to kill us in theminicomputer business.andP;  It was an industry that was broke all right.andP;  None ofus had any money.andM;I remember going to a conference and Jack Tramiel giving me hell because Ididn't fly night coach.andP;  Jack Tramiel is the guy who invented the concept:Pay for your computer now; we'll ship it in 90 days or give you your moneyback.andM;[Laughter]andM;Nobody in that industry had any money except maybe John Roach, and I don'tthink they were giving him much...andM;By the way, one of the things you do with kids is discipline them and thoseof you who don't believe that we act like children should have been at Comdexrecently and heard Osborne.andP;  During 1979, 1980 and 1981, Ben brought togetherpeople who were trying to build an industry; he made us talk to one another;he made people share where we were going.andM;I met the people who started ComputerLand; I met the people who startedBusinessland at his conference.andP;  I had a chance to sit around and talk to alot of people, and the industry was stronger because we worked togetherduring that time.andP;  But we wouldn't have worked together except thatoccasionally Ben would hold out this carrot and say, &quot;If you come to myconference, I'll introduce you to people who will make you money.andP;  But if youget out of line I'm going to smack you down.&quot;andM;During that time Ben  Rosen built an industry.andP;  Since then, he's gone off tomake money out of that industry, and  Esther's done a wonderful job ofhelping us learn and do something similar with the software industry.andP;  I'mnot sure she's going to pull off this thing about making Eastern Europetotally profitable on her own, but she's going to try.andM;[Laughter]andM;Ben deserves the credit for having nurtured an industry from the time it wasnothing to what it is today.andP;  I only hope when we start the next one, we'llfind someone else like him.andP;  Thanks, Ben.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: Thanks, Chuck, that was overly generous.andP;  You mentioned Jack Tramiel,who was the long-time CEO of Commodore and now has the same role at Atari.andO;Jack has a reputation for being a tough boss.andP;  Earlier today Chuck wastelling me one of the myriad Jack Tramiel anecdotes.andP;  Would you share that?andO;Peddle: He's already given away half the punch fine - by the way, Jack andIrving  [Gould] say thank you for making them so rich.andP;  They probably weren'there to do that.andM;[Laughter]andM;When I went to work for Jack Tramiel I'd come out of a computer background.andO;One of the leading companies at this time in calculators, computers andelectronic instruments was Hewlett-Packard.andP;  Hewlett-Packard meant quality,service and support.andP;  When we were getting ready to bring the personalcomputer to market, Jack said, &quot;I want to be like Hewlett-Packard.&quot; So Istarted building this quality organization with field service and a supportorganization.andP;  And one day Jack calls me into the office and says, &quot;How comeyou're spending so much money?&quot; I said, &quot;Jack, you said you want to be likeHewlett-Packard.&quot; He said, &quot;You don't understand, stupid.andP;  What I meant waswhen they first bring a product to market they sell it directly to theend-user, and they get cash in advance.&quot;andM;Thank you very much.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: Next I'd like to ask Philippe  Kahn to come up.andP;  Philippe, are youhere? Philippe is definitely here.andP;  While Philippe is walking up, I have toteff you about my first contact with him, which was indirect.andP;  I got a callin 1983 from a broker - I believe it was Kidder, Peabody-a broker who'd justfinished the financing of Lotus and Compaq.andP;  He said, &quot;I represent anentrepreneur who wants to start another software company.andP;  Are youinterested?&quot; I said,  Tell me about it.&quot; He said, &quot;They want to start inlanguages and compete with Microsoft.andP;  &quot; I said, &quot;That's promising; whatelse?&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;the founder just came over.andP;  He's French, he doesn't speakmuch English, and he's never run a business before.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;I thanked him and went on to other things.andP;  In 1988, a company we hadfinanced called Ansa Software merged with Borland, Philippe's company.andP;  Sofive years later I did meet Philippe and I'm on Borland's board now.andP;  As someare wont to say, or as Philippe likes to say, &quot;Ben, you can pay me now or youcan pay me later.&quot; We paid him later.andM;[Laughter]andM;Tribute to a man of noteandM;Philippe  Kahn, Borland: Thanks, Ben.andP;  It's a great honor to be here.andP;  I havea few presentations for you, Ben.andP;  The first thing is the true, uneditedbiography of Ben.andP;  I wanted all of you to have this for this dinner, but Esther wouldn't let me slip it under your doors last night.andM;[Laughter]andM;I have two presentations here.andP;  One is a presentation; the other one isactually a representation - a letter from that broker.andP;  He was called BillHap, a financial advisor in Mountain View.andP;  I had contacted Ben  Rosen onApril 19, 1983.andP;  At that time, the company existed for two weeks.andP;  I'd justarrived from France and was attempting to raise money.andP;  The important wordhere is attempting.&quot; Ben declined to invest in Borland with the comment thatunsolicited deals and business plans were too time-consuming.andP;  Let me read afew lines from Bill's letter:andM;Dear Philippe,andM;You may find the enclosed copy of one of myandM;note cards to be of interest.andP;  It's from BenandM;Rosen in 1983: &quot;No on Borland.andP;  ConflictsandM;with Lotus.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Ben has everything.andP;  The only thing Ben seemed to lack to be ready for thenew decade was to become an honorary member of the Turbo Jazz Band.andM;[Laughter]andM;We looked for a musical instrument, Ben, with a simple user interface.andM;[Laughter]andM;The first instrument we came out with were the claves.andM;Rosen: I never played the claves.andM;Kahn: Okay, great, we're going to have a band here.andP;  We haven't preparedthis.andM;[Clicks]andM;Kahn: He has a number.andP;  Keep on doing that - perfect !andP;  [Applause]andM;We got it! So for a mover and shaker of the industry like Ben, let's go forit! We got a band !andP;  [Rhythm played; applause]andM;Congratulations.andP;  Thank you.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: That represents our first dividend from Borland.andM;[Laughter]andM;An analytic approachandM;I was a securities analyst for 15 years, so I'm very sympathetic to theirplight.andP;  They're trying to follow this industry and are caught in theconflicts between their firms' sales forces and the investment-bankingdepartments.andP;  I thought it would be appropriate to have an analyst reminiscetonight.andP;  I'd like to ask Michele  Preston to start moving up here.andM;[Applause]andM;Michele is one of the deans of analysis of the microcomputer industry.andP;  Shefollows microcomputers and microcomputer software for Salomon Brothers.andO;These Personal Computer Forums have changed the lives of many of us.andP;  InMichele's case, I remember precisely the change in her life.andM;She used to be an analyst with a boutique called C.J.andP;  Lawrence.andP;  At one ofthe Forums, in Palm Springs, a bunch of us were in one of these big communaljacuzzis.andP;  Michele was in there; so was Mel Lavitt, then an executive at L.F.andO;Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin.andP;  Mel started interviewing Michele and by theend of the evening, Michele had changed jobs and joined Rothschild.andM;[Applause]andM;Michele  Preston, Salomon Brothers: Thanks, Ben.andP;  Just to set the recordstraight: We were all wearing our bathing suits.andM;[Laughter]andM;Rosen: Speak for yourself !andP;  [Laughter]andM;Preston: I met Ben in 1979, when I was a retail analyst covering suchexciting things as department stores and do-it-yourself home-improvementcompanies.andP;  One of the companies I covered was Tandy.andP;  I went down to visitTandy and they were talking to me about bits and bytes and RAMS and ROMS andKs.andP;  I had learned a little bit about same-store sales, but I didn't get anyof this other stuff.andP;  I came back and put the folder away.andP;  But people keptsaying, &quot;You know, Michele, none of the other retail analysts understandsthis stuff either so go ahead and do it, and you'll be ahead of the game.&quot;andM;They also said, &quot;There's this great analyst, Ben  Rosen at Morgan Stanley,and he runs this great conference, the PC Forum.andP;  You should go to hisconference; you'll learn a lot.&quot;andM;But before the conference in 1979, Tandy introduced the Model 11 and I wentto the analysts' meeting they had.andP;  I was at the cocktail party before thedinner, and this silver-haired gentleman came up to me and said, &quot;I'm BenRosen.&quot; I was a little startled, because I was expecting someone - let's say- a little more immature than Ben.andM;[Laughter]andM;He said, &quot;I read your Tandy report.andP;  I thought it was very good.&quot; Thatelevated Ben once again in my opinion.andM;[Laughter]andM;Later that evening Ben started balancing chairs on his chin, and I was like,&quot;This is Ben  Rosen?&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;I'd like to thank Ben for a couple of favors.andP;  One was in 1980 when he leftMorgan Stanley.andP;  At the time, we all thought it was because Ben was smart andwas going to make a lot of money as a venture capitalist.andP;  Later he told methe real reason he left was he didn't want to he beaten as the leadingpersonal computer analyst by a woman.andM;I'd like to thank Ben for taking me to the hot tub that evening in 1983.andP;  I'dalso like to thank him for the first assignment I had after joiningRothschild.andP;  Almost immediately Rothschild began working on the first IPO forthe  Sevin Rosen Fund, which was Osborne Computer.andP;  Fortunately it blew upbefore it could even get a prospectus out, so I didn't ever have to cover thecompany.andP;  But in December of that year, we took Compaq public - I believe at11 - and I was fortunate enough to be the analyst covering Compaq for theensuing period when the stock went to $3.andM;Rosen protests.andM;$3.50, excuse me.andP;  In closing I'd like to thank Ben for telling me, alongwith Rod, &quot;Stick it out, Michele, you'll be glad you did.&quot; I'm certainly gladI did.andP;  So thanks, Ben.andM;[Applause]andM;Estridge in the elevatorandM;Rosen: Certain moments in the history of this industry and certainly in myrecollection are indelible.andP;  I'd like to ask JeannetteandM;Maher to come up.andP;  Jeannette? Where is Jeannette? There she is.andP;  Jeannetteused to work for Don Estridge of IBM.andP;  It's a company I've had variousrelationships with over the years, but I was always friendly with DonEstridge and with Jeannette, who did public relations for the Entry SystemsDivision.andP;  I got to know them at conferences and at trade shows.andP;  Jeannette Maher,  Maher andamp; Associates: It was 1983 that Don Estridge spoke at one of themany financial industry analysts' meetings in New York City.andP;  November of 82, thank you.andP;  So, whose memory is failing?andM;As Don was waiting to go on, Ben  Rosen just moseyed over and with a Cheshiresmile, asked, &quot;Does Don have any time to come up to my office after themeeting?&quot; I said, &quot;Gee, I think we do.andP;  Our plane is not ready to go back fora few hours.&quot;andM;We went up to the office and there was this hide machine.andP;  I believe it hadan ugly amber-colored screen.andM;Rosen: It was green.andM;Maher.andP;  It was green? There was this spreadsheet, and Don was very impressed,both by the software and the hardware, which he was examining as best hecould.andP;  As we left Ben's office and were headed down in the Pan Am elevator,Don said, &quot;Wow, the industry is not going to be the same.andP;  That piece ofsoftware is absolutely incredible.&quot;andM;There was silence.andP;  We went down a few floors more and he was just lookinginto space.andP;  Then referring to the box, he said, &quot;Competition is good..andM;[Laughter]andM;...  for everyone.&quot; At that time, I don't know if we really knew how good thecompetition was going to be.andP;  But for years you and Rod Canion have beentouting that in five years you're going to be a $3-billion corporation.andP;  Ijust want to set the record straight.andP;  I'm not with IBM anymore, but the BocaRaton people - that Boca Zone down there - and Don Estridge are near and dearto my heart.andP;  We went from zero to a $5-billion corporation in three years.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: Well, Rod, once again we're second-best.andM;A couple of notes to what Jeannette said.andP;  The timing was interesting.andO;November  82 was right after 1-2-3 was announced publicly, and right afterthe Compaq computer - the first compatible computer - was introduced.andO;Neither had been shown at Comdex.andP;  They had just had press conferences, so itwas interesting to have Don Estridge who then was running IBM's operation tosee them before their widespread dissemination.andM;The other sidelight to that is - as many of you know - he was killed in thecrash of a Delta flight in August 1985, which was tragic.andM;Opps! I just dropped all my cards, so we've done a random scramble of thesubsequent speakers.andM;[Laughter]andM;A new visionandM;The next person I'd like to ask to share some memories represents one of theimportant departures in my life, and one of the most important people in thehistory of the personal commuter industry.andP;  Dan  Bricklin, would you startwalking up?andM;[Applause]andM;Dan, with his partner Bob Frankston  [now at Lotus], developed the seminalproduct of the personal computer industry, VisiCalc, which brought theinteractive spreadsheet to personal computers.andP;  I was lucky enough through myfriendship with Dan Fylstra  [now at Frontline Systems] and subsequently withDan and Bob to be one of the beta sites for VisiCalc in early 1979.andM;At the time I had an early Apple 11 computer.andP;  As  Esther mentioned in theletter, I'd spent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours trying to learnBASIC.andP;  I wanted to get all my earnings estimates in a program where I couldhave the histolical and projected data in a format I could give to our salesforce and to clients.andM;When VisiCalc came along, I realized all of that had been wasted because itwas so easy to do in a spreadsheet.andP;  I had one Apple II and I wanted to getanother one.andP;  At Morgan Stanley, which is only the wealthiest firm on WallStreet, I had the temerity to ask if I could buy a computer the firm wouldpay for.andM;I had one at home, but I was tired of carrying it back and forth, especiallywith the monitor.andM;[Laughter]andM;But they said, &quot;You have to get the permission of the Information SystemsDivision.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;I had to justify to the head of Information Systems that there was somethingI could do on an Apple 11 computer that couldn't be done with their IBMmainframe.andP;  He came up to my office and I sat him down at the Apple II.andP;  Ishowed him what was then a beta version of VisiCalc.andP;  Of course you couldn'tdo this on a mainframe, and he was blown away.andM;Today Morgan Stanley has 3000 personal computers.andP;  Anyway, Dan Biricklin !andO;[Applause]andM;Daniel  Bricklin, Software Garden: Speaking of these extra machines, Iunderstand an the speakers today get an LTE delivered to their door byFriday...andM;[Laughter]andM;Rosen: Talk to him  [points at Canion].andM;Bricklin: Talking about Ben is very strange.andP;  I found that wherever I turned,Ben was there.andP;  It's like those movies where there's always this person inthe background.andP;  Ben made a great impression on Dan Fylstra and encouragedhim to do things in the pc business.andP;  Dan worshipped Ben and viewed him asthe person to show everything to.andM;It's Ben's copy of VisiCalc that's in the  [Boston] Computer Museum - thatfirst disk along with the first Apple I and Bin Gates' tape of BASIC.andM;For Dan to be able to show the product at Ben's conference, we had to signthe contract.andP;  We finally did so late the night before Dan got on a plane.andO;It was at Ben's conference that the product was first shown.andP;  It was Ben whowrote about it first saying, &quot;Who knows? VisiCalc for spreadsheets may soonbe the tail that wags the personal computer dog.&quot; That's what he thinks ofyour stuff, Rod !andP;  [Laughter]andM;Next thing we know Hewlett-Packard's approaching us and trying to do a deal.andO;He was in on that.andP;  He was there with Lotus when we needed to be humble andhave somebody save us.andP;  His conference was always there, where we met allthese people in the industry.andP;  I saw my first real celebrity - Muhammed Aliat a conference some time ago.andM;He's a father figure within the industry - always there at each turn, lookingforward to seeing what happens as time goes on.andP;  Of course Ben, you're notalways right.andP;  People were reminding me that you always felt that the  [DEC]Rainbow was going to be a really hot machine.andP;  So you can't always - [Laughter]andM;it was watching you that I learned how really competitive venture capital is.andO;We were playing charades -  [Laughter] - after hours at some of theseconferences.andP;  It's amazing what he's willing to do in order to win, you know?andO;Boggles the mind.andP;  But for me it's an awfully important learning experience.andO;It was a very important time in my life when Dan first introduced me to Ben,not realizing how important he was to this industry.andP;  I hope you'll keep thisup and be back for the 20th.andP;  We'll be here for your 80th birthday and whoknows who's going to come through the cake in those days?andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: Thanks to Bob Frankston, too.andM;[Applause]andM;An instrumental friendshipandM;When I was at Morgan Stanley we were the investment bankers for TexasInstruments.andP;  Investment banking firms like to maintain the sanctity of theChinese Wall between the investment banking division and the researchdivision.andP;  They tell the analysts, &quot;Even though you represent clients, youare perfectly free to say anything you want, good or bad, about that client.andO;Because we're independent; we have a Chinese wall.&quot; What I didn't pick up wasthe wink when they said that.andM;[Laughter]andM;So when TI came out with its home computer in - Wally, when was it, 1978 or'79? - I wrote one of my famous Electronic Letters which quoted from&quot;Phaedra.&quot; It was something to the effect that they labored over a mountainand brought forth a mouse.andP;  That was the old mouse, not the computer mouse.andO;I also remember one of the phrases was, &quot;Never have so many spent so much forso long to bring out so little.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Needless to say this strained not only the relationship between TexasInstruments and its investment banker, but also between me and my boss.andP;  Butone relationship that was never strained was mine with Wally Rhines.andP;  Wallywas one of the Renaissance people within Texas Instruments, very un-TI-like.andO;That's a compliment, Wally !andP;  Wally is an outstanding person, and we have arelationship going back to the beginning of my conferences.andP;  Wally, would youcome up?andM;[Applause] Wally Rhines, Texas Instruments: Many of us think of Ben as thisdynamic manager and leader of major corporations in America.andP;  We tend toforget that 10 or 15 years ago, Ben had a much better job than managing majorcorporations.andP;  He had the job of criticizing the managers of thosecorporations.andM;[Laughter]andM;He built a reputation through the industry with his newsletter, and the CEOsof the semiconductor industry feared the thought of Ben writing a bad word.andO;That was enough to kill a new product.andP;  A good word from Ben about a companywas enough to inflate the multiple of even the most undeserving ofsemiconductor companies.andM;Ben had tremendous insight in his newsletters.andP;  After aH, who else wouldchoose the Intel432 as the next generation of standard microprocessor in theindustry?andM;[Applause]andM;There were standard practices that built up in the industry.andP;  Really secureCEOs would trust their managers to advise them.andP;  In poor economic times orwhen CEOs weren't quite so secure, they might go to their trustedtechnologists or marketing people and get some advice.andP;  If they were reallyinsecure, they'd do whatever Ben  Rosen said in his newsletter.andM;[Laughter]andM;In 1976 we were engaged in the dynamic RAM business, and we had a littleproblem.andP;  It was one of these industry standards.andP;  You see our 4K dynamic RAMhad 18 pins on it.andP;  So did National's and AMD's and others.andM;But another standard was emerging.andP;  In the case of the 18-pin, obviously anon-multiplex device ought to be able to run faster.andP;  But as we've seen manytimes since - as Intel has repeatedly proven with their microprocessorsuccesses against Motorola the best technology doesn't always make it.andM;Ben showed his first alliance with entrepreneurial ventures and people.andO;There was a little company in Dallas called Mostek, run by some crazy guy.andP;  Ican't remember who it was, but the guy was building a 16-pin 4K.andP;  Ben sidedwith these folks and ganged up on us.andP;  He met with Fred Bucy, who at thattime was president of TI.andP;  Ben asked him a lot of questions, and kept tellingFred this 16-pin was going to win and what were we going to do with our18-pin 4K?andM;Ben kept harping on this, so finally Fred revealed to Ben that TI was goingto introduce a 16-pin 4K RAM.andP;  That was the real shocker for Ben.andP;  He quicklywent back and wrote a newsletter article highlighting it:  TI will introduce16-pin 4K.andP;  It will become the new standard,&quot; and so on.andP;  It was an evenbigger shock for the people at TI because Fred was the only guy who knewabout it.andM;[Laughter]andM;In fact no one had even thought about a 16-pin version because they were toobusy trying to convince people the 18-pin was better.andP;  It would be aboutequivalent to John Sculley announcing the introduction of an IBM-compatiblepc for Apple.andP;  You can imagine the joy with which it was greeted in theindustry !andP;  Because there was no product definition involved, no committee,no review, nothing else, all we had to do was design one.andP;  We quicklyintroduced it, and...andM;[Laughter]andM;...  we didn't lose a stroke.andP;  So thanks to Ben, L.J.andP;  [  Sevin] got anothercompetitor in the 16-pin 4K RAM business.andP;  Thanks to Ben, TI stayed in thedynamic RAM business, and over the next ten years lost more money than on anyother product in our history.andM;[LaughterlandM;And thanks to Ben, Compaq can build computers in Texas and use chips fromTexas today.andP;  Thank you, Ben.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: Many of you probably wonder what Umtech Video Brain really was.andP;  We'revery fortunate to have in our audience tonight the original vp of marketingof Umtech Video Brain, and one of the original speakers at the first PersonalComputer Forum.andP;  Rich Melmon.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: Rich is no longer with Umtech Video Brain.andM;[LaughterlandM;Richard Melmon, Objective Software: There are more people at this table righthere in front of me than there were at that whole first conference.andP;  Is thathotel still standing?andM;Rosen: It's gone.andM;Melmon: Hotel's gone; Video Brain is gone; nothing is sacred.andP;  I actuallyhave a reminiscence of Ben that precedes my glorious days at Video Brain.andM;[Laughter]andM;I was at Intel in the early  70s, when the microcomputer had just beeninvented.andP;  I remember this vividly - it's a story I've never told him.andP;  I'mafraid it's not funny, but it goes to the heart of the way he worked and thereason he is so successful.andM;I don't know how many in this audience have had the pleasure and theprivilege of spending any time with Bob Noyce, who in some ways started thiswhole thing many years ago.andP;  Noyce was a wonderful, charismatic fellow, whowhen you sat with him even if you were a completely unimportant youngnewcomer at Intel - made you feel every word you said was important.andM;As Intel's first corporate planner, I had a meeting with Bob.andP;  My view of myjob was that I was to help intel into the world of microcomputers and we weregoing to cause this revolution.andP;  Intel's view of my job was that I was to layout the marketing department's desks and floor plan.andM;[Laughter]andM;I was having one of these visionary conversations with Bob -you would have tohave had one to know what it felt like, particularly if you were a young manwith great ambitions - and it was wonderful.andP;  We were tan&quot; about thisrevolution with the microprocessor.andP;  I asked Bob, &quot;How many people even hereat Intel really understand the impact this is going to have?&quot; He said rathersadly, There are only two or three people in the whole world that understandthis, and one of them isn't at Intel at all.&quot; It was Ben  Rosen.andM;Noyce had great respect for Ben, and turned to him many times for advice andcounsel.andP;  We all did.andP;  Ben had a way of coming into a company and befriendingthe people in the trenches the designers, the product-marketing people, thepeople trying to define what was really going to happen but who weren't highup in management.andP;  He was genuinely interested in what we all had to say.andO;Out of that came this great intuition for this business.andP;  That led to this.andO;It took a unique personality; it was not luck, ladies and gentlemen.andP;  Thisman did not arrive at this point because he was lucky with 1-2-3 or luckywith Compaq.andP;  That stuff all happened for a very definite reason.andP;  I'mhonored to have the chance to say a kind word about my old friend.andP;  Thankyou.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: This is really getting thick.andM;[Laughter]andM;A Voice: Did you pay him off?andM;From smokestacks ...andP;  to SteveandM;Rosen: Steve Jobs? Did Steve leave or are you still here, Steve? Steve left?andO;There was a customer in Montana, potentially?andM;[Laughter]andM;I wish he were here because Steve was as influential in my life as anyone,and my early involvement with Apple pointed me in this direction starting inlate  77.andP;  One of the wonderful Steve Jobs stories occurred when I was atMorgan Stanley.andP;  I was very interested in getting Apple Computer as aninvestment-banking client so we could take them public.andP;  Morgan Stanley, togive you perspective, was the investment banker for smokestack America.andM;Our clients were General Motors, US Steel, IBM, the top three chemicalcompanies in the country and International Paper.andP;  They had the top of everybasic industry in America, and they didn't do little deals.andP;  The theory was:It's as easy to do a big deal and you get more money.andP;  We'll do big deals.andM;In the five years I was there, I kept trying to get them to do technologycompanies but to no avail.andP;  I focused most of my attention on Apple, whichwas growing rapidly.andP;  It did $8 million in sales in 1978 and $48 million in1979.andP;  It looked like it would be ready to go public by 1980.andM;But I couldn't get anywhere with the management of Morgan Stanley.andP;  Theydidn't like to do these speculative companies; the fees weren't big enough;the risks were high.andP;  I had a strategy.andP;  I went to Bob Baldwin, the presidentof the company who normally didn't get involved in things like this.andP;  But Idecided to pun out all stops.andP;  Again, to give you some perspective, theinvestment bankers of the  70s are not the yuppie investment bankers of the 90s.andP;  These were the patricians who ran the industry for most of the 1900s.andM;I asked this distinguished chairman of the firm if I could get him togetherwith Steve Jobs, because in 1979 the National Computer Conference was beingheld in New York at the Hilton Hotel.andP;  That's when the NCC was the bigcomputer conference, and Apple was showing there.andM;Believe it or not, he agreed to walk the four blocks from the Exxon Buildingto the Hilton to meet this person - who was totally unknown at the time, Ican assure you.andP;  I thought,  Boy, once they meet each other, I'm sure thatBob is going to want to sign up.&quot; There was Steve before he discovered WilkesBashford and tailored suits.andP;  It was the original Steve Jobs, virtuallybarefoot and T-shirted, demoing his computer.andM;I got the two engaged in a conversation - the strangest conversation I'veever seen.andP;  Jobs was talking about this insanely great processor and thisinsanely great computer and the bits and bytes.andP;  Baldwin is talking at thesame time and saying, &quot;We are the top investment banking firm in thecountry.&quot;andM;He had no idea what the computers were and Steve had no idea what aninvestment banker was.andP;  It was a disaster.andP;  It's too bad it wasn't onvideotape.andM;[Laughter]andM;But through perseverance, a year later Morgan Stanley did break withtradition and do an emerging growth company for the first time.andP;  Since thenit's been one of the active underwriters of technology companies.andM;Next I want to invite another of our shyer, more reticent guests.andP;  JohnDoerr, are you in the audience? Could you make your way here?andM;John is one of the partners of Kleiner Perkins Caufield andamp; Byers.andP;  What can Itell about him other than his indolence, lack of motivation, laziness, lackof interest in technology?andM;Actually that's not true because John is a member of 73 boards of directors.andM;[Laughter]andM;And in the last month has invested in 182 deals.andP;  One of my oldest friendsand closest associates in the venture industry: John  Doerr.andM;[Applause]andM;A doerr into the industryandM;John  Doerr, Kleiner Perkins Caufield andamp; Byers: Like many of you I'm a refugeefrom the semiconductor industry, and first met Ben at Intel.andP;  I was at thatPlayboy Club conference and as I recall we didn't quite deBunnify the bar,Ben.andP;  It was still well-stocked.andM;[LaughterlandM;But I do remember Dan Fylstra's impassioned thanks to Andy Grove for the kindof talent he'd trained at Intel in the form of the CEO running his company atthat time.andP;  At another conference it was Phyllis Diller who jumped out of acake.andP;  Right? For some reason, Ben wasn't very interested.andM;I do recall Ben's view of venture capital as he got into the business in1981, and this may have originated with L.J.andP;  It went something along theselines: There are general partners and limited partners.andP;  In the beginning thegeneral partners have all the experience and the limited partners have allthe money.andP;  At the end, the general partners...andM;[Laughter]andM;Of course that wasn't true of the  Sevin  Rosen Fund, which was responsiblefor such off-the-scale successes as Lotus, Cypress and Compaq.andP;  Some of theCompaq board meetings I recall most fondly - when Ben and L.J.andP;  were togetheron the board - were when Ben corrected the spelling of the slides, or L.J.andO;Sevin complained about the fajitas.andM;[Laughter]andM;Rod was completely unflappable through all this.andP;  It must have been no morethan a week - maybe it was a month - before the IPO, that TI sued Compaq forviolating patents.andP;  This didn't bother Rod at all.andP;  Then there was IBM whichregularly was going to kill the company with the XT, then the portable, andthen the jr.andP;  Do you remember all those were just going to wipe Compaq offthe face of the earth?andM;Without taking any credit away from Rod's team because they have executed asno other team has, I do think Ben deserves some credit for the observationthat the desktop market was about three times bigger than that sewing-machinemarket that we were serving.andP;  Thus was born the DeskPro.andM;And credit for the observation that with our power in the channel, we couldget into related businesses.andP;  Sure enough, Rod put together ConnerPeripherals, which was a spectacular example of collaboration betweenentrepreneurial companies.andM;In sum, the collaboration between Ben  Rosen and L.J.andP;  Sevin produced themost spectacular results we've ever seen in venture capital.andP;  They rocketedright to the top of the industry in no time at all.andP;  They must have achievedfor their limited partners certainly not for themselves - at least $500million in profits.andP;  I'd guess it's more like a billion on an as-if-heldbasis today.andM;We're all beneficiaries of the greatest legal creation of wealth and fun thatI think organized commerce and crime have ever seen.andM;[Laughter]andM;More than anything else tonight, we have to thank Ben for setting a tone thatwe don't stand on each other's feet but on each other's shoulders.andP;  We have alot of fun at these conferences.andP;  This doesn't go on in the biotech industry,I assure you.andM;[LaughterlandM;And where regularly, once a year, charades are held - in which room?andM;Rosen: The Cottonwood.andM;Doerr: The Cottonwood Room tonight probably about I 1.andP;  To Ben  Rosen! Thankyou !andP;  [Applause]andM;The medium is the misinformationandM;Rosen: Bill Davidow? I've known Bill for years starting when he was a seniorexecutive at Intel.andP;  Now he's a fellow venture capitalist and the author oftwo outstanding books on high-tech marketing and on service.andP;  That's the endof your introduction; you can come up, Bill.andM;[Applause]andM;William H. Davidow, Mohr, Davidow Ventures: I need another 75-cent royaltycheek.andP;  I knew Ben when he was poor and the author of the most influentialnewsletter in the semiconductor industry.andP;  He not only reported trends, buthe also set them.andP;  Ben's really responsible for the world being an X86 worldinstead of a 68X world.andP;  In 1976 Intel was losing the microprocessor wars,and we needed a shill or a pigeon to proclaim we were the winners.andM;[Laughter]andM;We put together the Crush Team, and it instantly identified Ben as the personwho was going to carry this message.andP;  We knew one thing: Ben lovedconfidential information.andM;[Laughter]andM;All we had to do was get that confidential information to Ben, but we had tofigure out a vehicle to carry it.andP;  We selected Regis McKenna, who was aconfidant of Ben's, and got hold of a management presentation that said&quot;Target Accounts.&quot; We crossed that out, substituted &quot;Design Wins&quot; and stampedit confidential.andM;Regis went back to New York, had dinner with Ben and left this piece of paperon the dinner table.andP;  About two weeks later Ben reported we had won thebattle.andP;  The &quot;Design Wins&quot; started pouring in.andM;What I'd like you to remember for all of us, Ben, is that we have lived witha segmented architecture for 20 years.andM;[Laughter and applause]andM;A company blossomsandM;Rosen: Mitch, could you mosey up here, please? Mitchell? I'm jealous of Mitchbecause at some conference last year  [PC Forum] they had a competition forthe best-dressed and he beat me.andM;Mitch is the author of the famous productivity tool Tiny Troll which is how Igot together with him.andP;  Marv Goldschmitt showed me Tiny Troll; I startedusing it; I was impressed.andP;  I got to know Mitch and out of that came ourrelationship, then our investment in what became Lotus Development.andM;[Applause]andM;Mitchell  Kapor, ON Technology: Thank you, Ben.andP;  Before I turn my attentionto you, I felt it would be appropriate for someone to thank George Gilder forbringing back fond memories of such previous speakers as Marvin Minsky, whosetradition George continued tonight - an in-joke for those of you who havebeen here for a few years !andP;  [Laughter]andM;I can always count on Ben to be generous in his overstatement of myqualifications at the time they invested in Lotus.andP;  While it is true I was aTM teacher and all these other things you're aware of, you have to understandthe stellar industry qualification I had at the point at which Ben and L.J.andO;decided to invest.andM;I had written a couple of programs in BASIC for the personal computer.andP;  Onewas self-published - that was Tiny Troll - and Ben used to call me up forcustomer support on weekends.andP;  I'd written another program caned VisiPlot,also in BASIC, and I didn't have any management experience at all.andP;  I hadworked for a grand total of six months in the pc industry as a productmanager at Personal Software.andM;It was not on the basis of my resume, which was somewhat mixed, that Ben andL.J.andP;  made the investment.andP;  It was that he was willing to take a risk at atime when few people were wiring to take risks.andP;  He saw something in whatJohn Sacks and I were trying to do that went quite a bit deeper than what wasapparent.andM;I'm endlessly appreciative of the risks that you took.andP;  We had a funny dancewhen it actually came time to do the investment.andP;  As Ben mentioned, Iapproached him somewhat tentatively and said I was thinking about starting asoftware company.andP;  I think what I said was, &quot;Um, if I were to, ah, write abusiness plan, would you read it?&quot; Indicating that, gee, if Ben wasn't goingto take the time to read it I certainly wasn't going to write it.andM;[Laughter]andM;Actually the first draft was a 14-page letter that started off with a coupleof pages about how I hated vulture capitalists and hard-nosed business peopleand while I was going to start a business it certainly wasn't going to be oneof those kind.andP;  He took a look at it and very, very gently, without woundingmy fragile ego, said, &quot;Do you think you could actuary write it as a businessplan?&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;I was in his office in New York, and he showed me this stack of businessplans and said, &quot;These are the plans that I have to read so try to keep itshort.&quot; He showed me this other stack and said, &quot;These are the plans I'm notgoing to read; they're over 20 pages.andP;  So keep it short.andP;  &quot;andM;We put together a business plan and we struck a deal.andM;I want to mention a couple of the ways that Ben contributed to what we did atLotus.andP;  One thing that's not well-known is that Ben was actually responsiblefor the design of several of the product's features.andM;He's always been extremely passionate about the products, sometimes to thepoint of falling in love irrationally with things and making investments he'slater regretted.andP;  We were regularly sending him beta copies down to New York,because if we didn't he would come up to Boston and steal it off the desk.andM;He would play with these things and then call me and say, &quot;No, this thingshouldn't go that way.andP;  You've got to do this and fix that.&quot; He was a veryactive partner in the design process of the original 1-2-3, and shouldreceive credit for that.andM;Something else that's important to me is that I really learned thefundamentals of public relations and corporate communications by watchingwhat Ben did with the launch of 1-2-3 from the announcement at Windows on theWorld in  82.andP;  The invitation read, &quot;Ben  Rosen invites you,&quot; and sure enoughall these people showed up from Wall Street, the financial community and thepress.andP;  It was the most amazing thing.andP;  He conned Dick Shaffer into running aquote from Sy Merrin saying that 1-2-3 was going to be the hottest softwareproduct since VisiCalc, and we were off and running.andP;  Lessons well learned.andM;Thank you for your faith in me and for helping us with 1-2-3 and all theother things you've done.andP;  Thanks much.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: A foot note to that, Mitch.andP;  As you remember our program is and washeavily used for financial forecasting.andP;  In the forecast - which was ourbasis for funding the company - Mitch was looking for first-year revenues of$3 million.andP;  They ended up with $53 million, which shows the quality of theirforecasting software.andM;[Laughter]andM;Mitch mentioned the term vulture capital.andP;  Just in passing, Rod Canion, wouldyou come up and perhaps elaborate on that from your perspective? Rod Canion.andM;[Applause]andM;The real Ben !andP;  Rod Canion, Compaq: I would like to perform a public servicetonight.andP;  Although Ben  Rosen is the chairman of Compaq and standing only afew feet behind me, I feel I owe it to the public to balance these gushypositive stories about this nice guy who's had this effect on the industry.andO;Because it wasn't always that way.andM;[Laughter]andM;Picture if you will 1981.andP;  The industry's off and rolling.andP;  Buried somewherein the bowels of Texas Instruments - this is in Houston, even farther souththan Dallas - are these three engineers, kind of tired of a big company andwith some glimmering ideas about starting a company.andP;  We worked nights andweekends and put together this business plan, which was really hard becausewe didn't know what a business plan was.andP;  It just so happened there was thisnew venture capital company in Dallas, which was closer than New York orCalifornia.andP;  So we went to Dallas and gave the plan to L.J.andP;  Sevin, whoshowed it to his partner, Ben.andM;We didn't know who Ben was, but we talked to him off and on and we feltencouraged.andP;  They indicated they were interestedandM;sort of.andP;  We got excited, got to moving and finally in December 1981, weresigned from TI.andP;  At the time we thought we left on good terms.andP;  About aweek later we exited the company.andP;  Two days after that we were at Jim Harris'house - one of the other founders.andM;Our plan wasn't for a portable computer.andP;  It was for an add-on Winchesterdisk for the IBM which at the time only had 160K floppy disks for it.andP;  Itobviously needed a Winchester disk, and we were going to give one to theworld.andP;  That was our business plan.andM;We got a call and it was Ben.andP;  &quot;How are you doing? By the way, we've decidedwe're not going to fund this idea you have.&quot; We had not only resigned; wealso were out the door and had no money.andP;  Well we had money.andP;  We had extendedour MasterCards and our loans from the local banks so we had about six monthsof money for living expenses.andM;That was the bottom.andP;  I would say that in my whole time of knowing Ben thatwas the lowest perception I can recall ever having of him.andP;  And L.J., I mightadd.andM;[Laughter]andM;Surely they didn't plan it that way, but circumstantially you could believethat they'd waited until we'd quit before they told us they weren't going tofund this thing.andP;  I believe that's what happened.andM;[Laughter]andM;There's a story there that could make a bitter old man and a street person,probably in Houston somewhere.andM;[Laughter]andM;But as these things sometimes happen, there was a spark that didn't die.andP;  Webegan to look for something to convince these hard-core venture capitaliststo invest in.andP;  We eventually came up with the idea for a portable computerthat was compatible with the IBM desktop computer.andP;  The day the idea reallycame to me, the first or second person I called was Ben  Rosen.andM;Trouble was, Ben  Rosen wasn't in his office.andP;  He was out of town for a weekor two, and it was about ten days later when we finally got hold of him.andO;They were busy, but they were going to be in Texas in a couple of weeks, andmight have a few minutes to talk to us.andP;  We met them in a motel room inHouston and showed them our business plan.andP;  It was about three pages that'swhy we got him to read it, I guess - for the Compaq portable.andP;  The rest ishistory.andP;  They did like the idea.andM;There was one more hurdle to get over.andP;  I remember L.J.andP;  saying, &quot;Shoot, ofcourse that's a good idea.andP;  We thought of that a couple months ago.andP;  Butthese are the guys who had this wild idea for a Winchester disk for the IBMPC.andP;  There's no way they could possibly go out and compete with IBM andOsborne and all of these established companies.&quot;andM;We really had a job to sell them on the possibility that these Texasengineers could put together a product that could compete.andP;  Fortunately wedid, they invested, and we did compete.andP;  Thank you.andM;[Applause]andM;A southern perspectiveandM;Rosen: That's another company that missed their business plan.andP;  They wereforecasting $20 or $30 million in the first year and did $111 million.andP;  Someof these entrepreneurs just can't forecast well.andM;I'd like to introduce my long-time partner, L.J.andP;  Sevin.andP;  I can tell you manyanecdotes about him but because this is a mixed audience I'm speechless.andM;L.J.andP;  is a fellow Louisianian.andP;  In fact, when we started our venture firm wewere the only US venture firm whose general partners were alltrombone-playing Louisianians.andP;  A dubious distinction.andP;  L.J.andP;  Sevin.andM;[Applause]andM;L.J.andP;  Sevin,  Sevin  Rosen Management: Thank you.andP;  We do go on.andP;  This is abit like &quot;This Is Your Life, Ralph Edwards.&quot;andP;  Esther told me I was supposedto recount a funny incident in our lives.andP;  A lot of funny things havehappened to us in the seven, eight, ten years we've been in business.andO;Unfortunately not many of those can I tell in this audience.andP;  But one I canand it's my favorite Ben  Rosen story.andP;  It's suitable because it's totallyirrelevant.andM;[Laughter]andM;Ben and I were scheduled to go to Houston to talk to Rod Canion and JimHarris and to get our first look at the pie-shop sketches.andP;  A couple daysbefore that John Roach of Tandy was having a big bash for industry analystsand the press in Fort Worth, Texas, which is about a 30-minute drive from myhome in Dallas.andM;Ben was still the publisher of the  Rosen Newsletter, and as such he wasinvited to that conference.andP;  He certainly wouldn't have been invited if JohnRoach had known that we were taking his money to fund a competitor.andM;The bash was held at Tandy corporate headquarters in downtown Fort Worth.andO;Ben was to come the night before and spend the evening at the AmericanaHotel, which is now the Worthington Hotel, right across the street fromcorporate headquarters.andM;Ben called me and said, &quot;Hey, why don't you come get me after the meeting atTandy? There's a party at Billy Bob's in West Fort Worth.&quot; So I decided I'dpick him up, take him back to Dallas and the next day we'd go to Houston.andM;I went to the Americana Hotel in the late afternoon about 6, and waited forBen to go to Billy Bob's.andP;  Billy Bob's is one of these places of westernentertainment and mechanical horses and all of those things.andP;  As I'm waitingfor Ben in the lobby of the Americana Hotel, the elevator opens and thisapparition appears.andM;Now you've got to visualize this with me.andP;  Here's this New York Jew steps offthe elevator.andP;  He has two-tone, elaborately decorated cowboy boots, abrand-new set of jeans, a very wide western belt with a big golden bucklewith the state of Texas on it, a Roy Rogers shirt, and a bolo, one of thosestring ties with a decorative longhorn with very long horns.andP;  Around his neckis a red bandana hanging over the side, and on his head the biggest damnedwhite 10-gallon hat.andM;[Laughter]andM;He was a kosher Tom Mix.andM;[Laughter]andM;This was the funniest thing I've ever...andP;  But I got to thinking of where wewere going, and I looked at him and said, &quot;Boy, you better get back up toyour room and change clothes.andP;  Because I don't know if you've ever been toBilly Bob's.andP;  It's in the stockyards in Fort Worth and there are some realcowboys there.andP;  One of them's going to take one look out of you and beat theshit out of you.&quot; Pardon my French.andM;[Laughter]andM;We went anyway.andP;  He survived.andP;  Actually John Roach had some security forcesthere so that nobody could touch him.andM;[Laughter]andM;Sevin: Thank you.andM;[Applause]andM;Down memory laneandM;Rosen: For nostalgia's sake I wanted to bring up one of my oldest friendswhom I've known since the mid '50s when we were both graduate students atStanford - I m electrical engineering and he in theater arts.andP;  As part ofthis Esther wanted us to try to recollect how we all met.andM;I distinctly remember how I met Jerry Weissman.andP;  Where are you, Jerry? I meta ravishing redhead named Pat London at a party.andP;  I invited her to theStanford-UCLA game, and she accepted.andP;  I neglected to tell her, however, thatthe game was 450 miles south of Stanford in UCLA.andM;I drove her down there in my Austin-Healy and we bounced the whole way.andP;  Thenext day in the stands at the stadium she saw Jerry, whom she knew.andP;  Sheintroduced me to him and said, &quot;Ben, meet Jerry.andP;  I'm flying back.andP;  You gowith him.&quot;andM;I rescued Jerry a year ago from his previous position.andP;  Having attended a lotof conferences and watched a lot of speakers, I thought it would be awonderful idea to have Jerry perform his specialty-help withpresentations-for a lot of our executives.andM;Before I met Jerry I was a wooden speaker - I spoke in just one tone.andP;  Afterone lesson from Jerry Weissman, I now speak emphatically-with HANDS THRUSTMODULATION.andM;Is that good, Jerry?andM;[Applause] Jerry Weissman, Power Presentations: Thank you, Ben.andP;  In herconference issue  Esther described Ben as having began his fife as amild-mannered engineer at Raytheon.andP;  Since I bear the dubious distinction ofhaving known him when he was an engineering student at Stanford, I thoughtI'd give you a picture of the transformation from engineer to venturecapitalist.andM;The truth is that as a graduate-student engineer at Stanford Ben wore theuniform.andP;  He had a crew cut, short-sleeved shirts, the nerd pack, chino pantsand a slide rale on the belt.andP;  The only thing he didn't have was white socks.andO;That was not as much a style choice as that Stephanie hadn't arrived on thescene to keep them clean for him.andM;They don't know about Stephanie.andP;  Okay.andM;[Applause]andM;Then Ben was transformed.andP;  He left engineering.andP;  He went on to ColumbiaGraduate School of Business, to Coleman and Company, to Morgan Stanley, andon into the venture capital community.andP;  He came out the dapper man we knowtoday.andM;From the top down, let's look at Ben.andP;  The crew cut has been replaced byblow-dried hair.andM;[Laughter]andM;Of course with the hairline the way it is I think the barber was a bit toozealous.andM;[Chuckles]andM;He traded in the short-sleeved shirts for pin stripes with such a vengeancethat Paul Stuart tripled his space on the revenues from Ben  Rosen'spurchases.andP;  Argyle notwithstanding, he traded in the chino trousers for polkadots.andP;  His suspender collection has robbed B.F.andP;  Goodrich of its rubbersupply.andM;This is the Ben we all know.andP;  This is the Ben we all love.andP;  With my view ofBen from the early part of his career, I'm a Johnny-come-lately.andP;  You allknow him in the technology industry.andP;  I've only known him for the past yearin the technology industry.andM;I have a reminiscence that talks about the transformation best of all.andP;  Benintroduced me to a small out-of-state computer company he was examining forpotential investment.andP;  He put me together with these people to attempt tohelp them make a better presentation.andM;As it happened, my session with that group was on the afternoon of the dayBen was to make his visit.andP;  We didn't cross paths; I arrived after him andentered the board room with a group of engineers who were to make theirpresentation.andP;  My job is to help them be clear and succinct.andP;  I asked them totell me their story.andM;Three of them were from India.andP;  Being engineers they had to be very thoroughand they said, &quot;The CPU has to be expressed here and it has to go through themicroprocessor.andP;  You have to explain how it goes in here and comes outthere.&quot; I said, &quot;Wait, wait, wait.andP;  Can you just net it out so that we cantell the story succinctly?&quot;andM;Then they said, &quot;Oh, no, no, no, Jerry, we can't do that.andP;  It has to be veryspecific so that everybody understands the function of the computer.&quot;andM;I worked on this gentleman for about 30 minutes, until finally he netted itdown to about a paragraph.andP;  I said, &quot;So what you're telling me is that theunique thing about your computer is that it does this and this and this?&quot; Hesaid,  Yes, that's it.andP;  You've made it so clear that even a layman like BenRosen can understand.&quot;andM;[Laughter]andM;Esther also said in her newsletter she's grateful to Ben for his generosity.andO;I'm grateful to Ben for his generosity, but I'm also grateful to Ben for hisfriendship.andP;  Having known him for 32 years, I can tell you that what I seehere is just an expression of what I've known all along.andP;  Thank you, Ben.andM;[Applause]andM;Gatesway to successandM;Rosen: The last of our 73 speakers tonight is Bill Gates.andP;  Bill didn't speakat the first conference, but he was at the second one in New Orleans in 1979and at every one since.andP;  One anecdote about the effect of the Forums onBill's life was that in 1979 he hadn't had much exposure to the financialcommunity, being a relatively obscure, privately held company at the time.andM;He said that in the 12 months after he'd appeared at the Forum in New Orleansin 1979, he had 50 venture capitalists and investment bankers visit him inSeattle.andP;  Your comment was you never knew there were so many fine restaurantsin Seattle.andM;[Laughter]andM;You have the PC Forum to thank for it.andP;  Bill?andM;[Applause] Bill Gates, Microsoft: This has really been a great roast.andP;  I'vewritten a couple new programs tonight.andM;[Laughter]andM;Ben really has done a lot of great things for the industry.andP;  One of thethings is getting people together and getting them to talk with each other.andO;in fact when Ben asked me to speak, ten years ago, I'd never given a bigpublic speech.andP;  I thought, &quot;I've got to get some real facts into thisspeech.&quot; I packed it full of facts, put a lot of energy into it, went down toNew Orleans and gave that speech.andM;Afterwards Ben mentioned to me people probably hadn't understand about halfof what I said.andP;  But he said that was okay - it gave the conference the rightflavor.andM;[Laughter]andM;It's great that Ben is oriented toward products and was always optimisticabout them.andP;  He used to talk about seeing the industry through hisRosen-colored glasses.andP;  The Texas Instruments story is not really complete,because well before they introduced their product, Ben wrote a lot ofnewsletters saying how TI was going to come in and take over the personalcomputer industry.andM;I went down to TI after I read that, volunteered to write a BASIC for themand did a lot of work for them.andP;  It didn't turn out as had been predictedearlier, and Ben was quick to recant his predictions.andP;  Ben also has livenedup the industry quite a bit - balancing chairs on his chin is only thebeginning.andP;  We used to have parties after NCC which were great parties.andP;  Butwe were careful at this one in Chicago not to have any chairs at all.andO;Because we knew Ben was coming.andM;[Laughter]andM;But sure enough, late into the party Ben took the drink trays and startedbalancing those on his nose - just one of his many talents.andP;  One of the lastthings I'll mention that I miss is that Ben did know how to give aconference, only charged  400 and made money.andM;[Laughter]andM;And I do miss that.andP;  A lot.andM;[Applause]andM;Thanks, Ben.andM;[Applause]andM;Rosen: A comment like that can only bring  Esther  Dyson up to the podium.andM;Esther, is it possible to make monet if you  charge $400?andM;I want to conclude by thanking  Esther - thanking her for tonight, thankingher for buying my company albeit at a  distress price.andP;
