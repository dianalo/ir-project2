Sincethere occurs a cancellation in the contribution of the two-nucleon mechanism,the {Delta} mechanism becomes important. Using the calculated nuclearmatrix elements, the upper limits on the effective coupling constantsof right-handed leptonic currents vertical strokeandless;{lambda}andgt;vertical strokeandless; 2 x 10/sup -3/ and vertical strokeandless;etaandgt;vertical stroke andless; 2 x 10/sup-4/ are deduced from recent experimental data.</TEXT></DOC>
