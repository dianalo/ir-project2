But industry analysts, and even someoil-company executives, caution against joining the fray.   China spends almost $10 billion annually to import about50% of its petrochemical needs. To conserve foreign exchange,Beijing unveiled an ambitious plan in February that aims tomake China self-sufficient in petrochemicals by the year2000. Although few believe that is possible, the prospect ofChina closing its market to imports as it tries to achieveits goal has spawned widespread concern among major suppliersin the region.</LP><TEXT>   These producers -- including such aspiring exporters asSouth Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia -- have been counting onChina to soak up a glut in petrochemical supplies expected toresult after several years of hectic expansion of theirproduction capacity. As a result, many foreign companies arenow considering direct investments in China to protect theircurrent market share.   &quot;Everybody has a {petrochemical} plan,&quot; says Tadao Manabe,general manager of the energy and petrochemical division atMarubeni Corp. &quot;Competition in selling to China is getting sohard that we see a need to join hands to invest.&quot; Marubeni isdoing just that with several other big Japanese tradinghouses to explore the feasibility of establishing an ethyleneplant in northeast China.   They aren't alone. Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine ofFrance recently signed a letter of intent to invest in a $2.5billion oil refinery to produce naphtha, jet fuels and otherindustrial fuels in Shanghai. This follows a Februaryannouncement that Royal Dutch/Shell Group obtained anofficial nod for a feasibility study on a proposed $2.5billion oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Guangdongprovince. Amoco Corp. of the U.S. also is negotiating for ajoint venture to build a $300 million plant to producesynthetic materials used in making polyester.   Industry analysts, however, warn of formidable barriers.The sheer scale and complexity of these projects is one majorobstacle. But most critical is the possibility that shortagesof domestically produced crude oil and naphtha will drive upproduction costs by forcing petrochemical plants to rely onimported feedstocks. Reliance on imports also could lead tosuch thorny problems as those facing Shell and Amoco in theirnegotiations on foreign-exchange earnings and market share.   &quot;Where do we get crude oil? How do we generate foreignexchange to pay for our imports? What percentage of ouroutput can we sell in the domestic market? You are talkingabout some really complicated problems in China,&quot; says anexecutive closely involved in a proposed petrochemicalproject. &quot;I won't be surprised that many of them turn out tobe empty talks, &quot; he added.   Nevertheless, the rush is on to set up high-profile,big-money petrochemical projects, providing the surest signyet that foreign direct investment in China is beginning torecover. Foreign capital inflows dropped sharply afterChinese troops crushed the pro-democracy movement in June1989, and China's economic plight contributed to the slide.   More recently, China has regained a measure of politicaland economic stability, as well as acceptance in theinternational community, thus prompting potential investorsto dust off old plans.   &quot;Our plan has been delayed because of what happened twoyears ago, but now we think it's a good time to start lookingagain,&quot; says Marubeni's Mr. Manabe. The consortium thatincludes Marubeni, Mitsubishi Corp., C. Itoh andamp; Co. and Mitsuiandamp; Co. was formed more than a year ago, but has become activeonly recently.   The logic behind China's expansion of the petrochemicalsector seems compelling. As textiles and other lightindustries have flourished, China's imports of syntheticfibers, plastics and other, higher-value petrochemicalintermediates have grown so rapidly they now represent about20% of the country's total imports.   Following Taiwan and South Korea, China now hopes toconserve foreign exchange through import substitution. The1991-1995 Five Year Plan thus calls for the construction ofmore than a dozen ethylene plants and three synthetic-fiberplants. When completed, the ethylene plants would doubleChina's annual output to three million metric tons by 2000.Ethylene, derived from crude oil, is used in plasticsproduction.   In an apparent strategy shift, China Petrochemical Corp.,or Sinopec, says it is seeking foreign equity participationto propel these petrochemical projects.   In the 1980s, Sinopec relied mainly on imported technologyto produce petrochemicals on its own, a costly exercise thathas saddled the company with an estimated $6 billion offoreign debt. That burden may be what is now promptingSinopec to seek foreign capital to pursue the country's goalsin the next century.   Until recently, many foreign oil companies and Japanesetrading houses were happy simply selling petrochemicals toChina. But as Beijing begins to work toward self-sufficiency,these companies worry that they will be left out as Chinaadjusts its import needs to lower-value-added products suchas naphtha and crude oil and away from plastics and otherpetroleum derivatives. As a result, these companies areexploring investment opportunities to maintain market share.   For the Japanese traders, China's plans also presentopportunities to sell equipment for proposed plants.According to an official close to the negotiations, theconsortium has proposed a $2 billion ethylene plant in thenortheastern province of Liaoning. It has lined up suchpowerful Chinese partners as Sinopec, China NationalPetroleum andamp; Oil Gas Corp. and the Liaoning government for theproposed 450,000-ton-a-year facility.   &quot;As trading companies, we don't want to take on too manyrisks, that's why we decided to share our risks,&quot; says theofficial, who emphasizes that negotiations are still at anearly stage.   However, skeptics speculate that the Japanese tradingcompanies' proposal could be mere posturing, either to curryfavor with Beijing or to block the entry of competitors bytying up Chinese officials in protracted negotiations. Theynote that only a few of a dozen proposed petrochemicalprojects in Asia during the past few years are on track; manyhave been stymied by political and economic barriers. InChina, analysts say, these problems tend to be magnified.</TEXT></DOC>
