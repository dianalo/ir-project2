With alarge Ge(hp) detector and a {Delta}E-E plastic scintillator telescope,{beta}{gamma}-coincidences as well as {beta}-singles and {gamma}-singlesspectra were recorded. From the {beta}{gamma}-matrices, 14 and 15 independent{beta}-spectra in coincidence with different {gamma}-transitions wereevaluated for the two isotopes respectively. The final O/sub {beta}/values are: 9790+-100 keV for /sup 91/Br and 12155+-100 keV for /sup92/Br. In addition, Q/sub {beta}/ values could also be derived from thesame {beta}{gamma}-coincidence matrices for the daughter nuclei /sup91/Kr and /sup 92/Kr. The values obtained agree well with those givenin the literature. In a plot of the one-neutron separation energies ofthe nuclei in this mass region, the subshell closure effect at N=56 isalso observed for the Br isotopes with Z=35, contrary to theoreticalpredictions. Finally, the mass excesses for /sup 91,92/Br and /sup 91,92/Krare calculated and compared with recent predictions of different massformulae.</TEXT></DOC>
