According to Robert Martin, a vice-president at Ontologic, anobject database integrates an object programming language (usually C++) withdatabase functionality, thereby fulfilling the requirements to buildhigh-performance database applications with well-structured, easilymaintained applications.andP;  Such databases save objects on the disk so thatthey can be used in future sessions and shared by many users, and they alsoprovide applications programs with an abstract interface to data, enablingprogrammers to change or reorganise the database without changing anyapplication code.andP;  Martin claims that object databases have one majoradvantage over relational databases: namely that relational databases aren'tflexible as they have to store all data in fixed-length records - allapplications data must be converted to these records making relationaldatabases slow and prone to error.andM;Abstract pointersandM;However, with Ontologic's product Ontos, the database can directly store andretrieve objects as a whole rather than trying to fit every thing intorecords as a relational system does.andP;  Furthermore, Ontos uses abstractpointers to implement relationships among objects whereas relational systemsuse keys to &quot;join&quot; operations, and while a relational system cannot get holdof an entire complex object in one query, an object database can retrieve anobject composed of many other objects as a whole.andP;  As far as Martin isconcerned, this means that object databases have three highly marketablefeatures vis a vis relational databases: they are designed to handle any typeof data (rows and columns, graphics, finite elements, bit-map imaging and soon); secondly, they can handle such complex data at high speed, being up to1,000 times faster at graphics and documentation than relational systems;thirdly, they offer high programmer productivity, since applications are easyto build and maintain using them.andP;  So far all this might sound like littlemore than vendor-hype, however, the politics of database marketing hasrecently been stirred up by the publication of the ButlerBloor report&quot;Database: An Evaluation andamp; Comparison&quot; (CI No 1,438).andM;In the report the authors Martin Butler, Robin Bloor and Paul Beach make somestriking statements about relational databases.andP;  They say that they found noevidence to suggest that many relational database management systems canoffer satisfactory solutions for the large, complex database implementationsthat are needed for an organisation's core business data processing.andM;By Katy RingandM;The software triad continues by stating: &quot;performance limitations associatedwith the relational approach may cause a backlash in the market, with there-emergence of non-relational options...andP;  object-oriented methods...andP;  willcome to dominate the database market over the next three to five years.&quot;andO;Messrs Butler, Bloor and Beach are particularly unhappy about Oracle'sdominance in the database market saying &quot;despite its dynamic marketing, manyof Oracle's products have been relatively static and in the database area ithas been overtaken in sophistication by Ingres and Sybase.andP;  If it loses itssales momentum it will find it difficult to recover.&quot; On the next page theCanadian company Cognos is discussed as follows: &quot;PowerHouse StarBase is animpressive product with a number of unique features, such as multiversioning,and could become quite popular if it acquires sufficient momentum&quot;.andP;  Whileboth these statements are very probably true, each contains an extremelylarge &quot;if&quot; qualification which centres around the marketing of databases.andO;ButlerBloor Ltd finds the concept of &quot;hard sell&quot; distasteful because it drawsattention away from the technical merits of a product, which is a perfectlyreasonable viewpoint, except when it clouds the issue of forecasting thedevelopment of a market.andP;  Will object-oriented databases really dominate themarket in three to five years time? And are relational databases about to dieout and with them a huge company such as Oracle? From talking to Ontologic'sRobert Martin the answer to both these questions would seem to be no.andP;  Totake the second question first.andP;  Most relational database vendors arebeginning to add object-oriented features to their relational databases -this is only at the front end, but with time and money there is nothingpreventing them moving to object databases.andP;  The issue is more of a religiousone than a practical one - those vendors that are adamant that the relationalmodel rules, despite a changing market, may suffer.andP;  However, ironicallyenough for the ButlerBloor scenario, top of the list of relational vendorsthat may go under in this way are the technically led companies that will,arguably, find shifting to another database paradigm more difficult thanmarket-led companies.andP;  As for the first question, although Martin describeshis company as precocious, it is largely marketing its Ontos database for thebenefit of customers that never moved to a relational database in the firstplace.andP;  In other words, Ontologic's natural constituency is thecomputer-aided design and manufacturing community that couldn't have used arelational database because its application files are too complex.andP;  They arealso confirmed Unix users who are familiar with the C language.andP;  Where Martindoes replace a relational database product it is more than likely to beSybase - a fact to be weighed when judging which relational vendors may fallprey to rival object databases.andP;  Martin argues that object databases willtake hold of the database market much faster than relational systems did inthe 1980s.andP;  Rising waveThis is because they already have a standard languageinterface in C++, they are in a position to ride the rising wave of networkcomputing because they can take advantage of graphical applications, and if,like Ontos, they support SQL then they also provide a link with pastapplications and data.andP;  However, when it comes to the business communitywhere the majority of software is sold, object databases don't look as ifthey're about to stage quite the revolution they could in the design world.andO;Although Martin argues that people are clamouring for complex graphics intheir management information systems, and that banks, stock exchanges andleading high street chain stores are all in the process of evaluatingobject-oriented technology, he admits that object databases are no fasterthan relational databases when it comes to things like on-line transactionprocessing.andP;  The one factor that may unleash object databases onto thebusiness world is the arrival (expected sometime next year) and consequentsuccess of object-oriented Cobol.andP;  But since no such language has yetappeared - and when it does it won't be compatible with previous versions ofCobol (CI No 1,427) - the speed with which object databases penetrate thebusiness world is likely to be slow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
