The vote in Parliament, after more than seven hours of sometimesbitter debate, was 43 in favor and 15 against, with 11 abstaining.But 51 legislators were absent, including some Likud members whowalked out before the vote of confidence was called.   Likud dissidents included Industry Minister Ariel Sharon andEconomy Minister Yitzhak Modai, who has called on Shamir to resign.   In the occupied territories, two Palestinians were killedWednesday and at least 14 were wounded, Arab hospital officialssaid.   Ala Jibril, 15, died of a gunshot wound to the head in Askarrefugee camp on the West Bank, the Arab report said.   The army said Omar Abu Jaber, 41, died of a bullet in the chestin nearby Jenin, but it added that no troops were operating there.Israel Radio said an Israeli civilian may have shot Jaber. An armyspokesman confirmed five wounded and said it was checking the othercasualty reports.   Wednesday's deaths brought the toll to 481 Palestinians killedsince Arabs began revolting 17 months ago against Israelioccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-one Israelisalso have been killed in the uprising, which Shamir is trying toend with a plan calling for Palestinians to elect representativesto negotiate a limited autonomy.   Gaza's 700,000 residents were confined to their homes for athird day as Israeli police continued a sweep of Israeli marketsand factories, forcing home all Gazan Arabs.   The loss of wages could cause severe hardships for 50,000 Gazaresidents who work in Israel and have few job opportunities athome. Some Israeli industries that depend on Arab labor alreadyhave sought permission to import workers from abroad.   Shmuel Goren, coordinator for the occupied lands, told aparliamentary committee Wednesday that Gazans will not be allowedto return to Israel without special permits, Army Radio reported.He said the permits also would be issued to 60,000 West Bankersemployed in Israel.   Goren said some 28,000 Gazans with criminal records would notget permits, the radio said. It was unclear if this includedPalestinians jailed without charge for anti-Israeli activities suchas organizing protests.   In presenting his peace proposal, Shamir played down itsrejection by leading Palestinians who charge it is a ploy to cheatthem out of a Palestinian state.   The plan rules out participation by the Palestine LiberationOrganization, which is outlawed in Israel but which manyPalestinians consider their rightful representative.   ``From the Arab side, there have been voices of refusal andrejection,'' Shamir said. ``We do not think these voices are thefinal word.''   Among opposing legislators was Geula Cohen of the extreme-rightTehiya party, who warned of a backlash in Israel.   ``If you fail to see the writing on the wall, then there will bean uprising that will force you, Mr. Prime Minister, to bring anentirely new proposal,'' she said. ``This uprising will be withoutstones, but it will also be without gloves.''   At a Likud meeting before the vote, opponents argued the planpaves the way for the creation of a Palestinian state.   ``The initiative states that we shall negotiate with any Arabwho is elected,'' said legislator Pessah Grupper. ``This is leadingtoward negotiations with the PLO.''   Shamir assured them that Palestinians ``involved in PLO activitywill not be able to run in elections or vote.''</TEXT></DOC>
