(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Biologists believe Florida's onlyendangered fish species is being squeezed out of its habitat byanother species descended from discarded bait fish.   Brown darters apparently were introduced into Florida Panhandlestreams years ago when fishermen cleaned out their bait buckets.   The newcomers are now out-competing native Okaloosa darters forfood and habitat, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service isconducting a study to find out why.   Only 1,500 to 10,000 of the two-inch long Okaloosa darters arebelieved to be left in streams leading into Rocky and Boggy bayous,the only places in the world where they are found.   Both fish eat worms and insects.   The Okaloosa darter is related to the Tennesse snail darter,another endangered species that was the center of a controversy in1978, delaying completion of a huge dam because of fears it wouldwipe out the last of the tiny fish.   The Okaloosa darter doesn't face such a threat. Most of itshabitat is on Eglin Air Force Base's military reservation. Weaponstesting on the reservation has not harmed the darter, saidbiologist Noel Burkhead and Jim Williams, who is heading the study.Both work out of the National Fisheries Research Center inGainesville.</TEXT></DOC>
