Fires in thefireplace, burning candles and all the combustible objects in the house --from trees to gifts -- increase the risk.;   That's why I insisted on havingsmoke detectors and heat detectors installed with my security system when myhouse was built a few years ago. Smoke detectors are by far the morerecommended of the two. Here's a little test:;   Did you know there are twobasic types of smoke detectors? They're either ionized or photoelectric.Ionized are the more sensitive. In fact, they're so sensitive that tobaccosmoke, cooking and fireplace smoke can set them off.;   Photoelectric smokedetectors might be more appropriate for the kitchen because they are set offonly by heavy smoke.;   Heat detectors are set off by a fast, hot fire, butthere are two types. A fixed type is triggered by a preset temperature-sensingdevice. A rate-of-temperature type is triggered by a fast increase in thetemperature of the room.;   Because it might take time for a fire to becomehot and large enough for a heat detector to be set off, a smoke detectoralmost always will detect a fire first. That's why the National FireProtection Association says that heat detectors should be used only inconjunction with smoke detectors.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NICK HARDER, Orange County Register  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911130  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  292  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, November 30, 199100335116,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
