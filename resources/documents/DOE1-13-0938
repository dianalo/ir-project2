<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0938 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new parametric method is present which uses a normal distribution toestimate dose modifying factors (DMF) with 90% confidence limits fromordinal radiation response data such as acute mouse skin reaction orseverity of cataract formation. Using RBE for d(22)Be neutrons for acutemouse skin response as an example, the new method gives RBE estimatessimilar to those obtained with previously published parametric and nonparametricmethods. The new method uses the experimental data directly, producingboth a value for DMF and also confidence limits, at each of several levelsof response. The method is straightforward and easy to apply.</TEXT></DOC>
