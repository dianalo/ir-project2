<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0384 </DOCNO><TEXT>The observability of the heavy Higgs boson (m/sub H/ andgt; 2m/sub W/) throughpure leptonic decays of Z pairs from Higgs and continuum processes isstudied. A bump hunt in m/sub ZZ/ is possible for m/sub H/ andless; 600 GeV.For m/sub H/ andgt; 600 GeV, precise knowledge of the background rate is essential.The following is a progress report of the Heavy Higgs Working Group forthe July 1987 Workshop on Experiments, Detectors and Experimental Areasfor the Supercollider to be held in Berkeley, CA.</TEXT></DOC>
