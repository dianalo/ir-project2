The magazine An-Nahar Arab and International said Hezbollah, orParty of God, has ``decided to release two American captives as agoodwill gesture.''   The group, composed of Shiite Moslem fundamentalists loyal toIran, is believed to be an umbrella for underground factions thathave claimed the abduction of most of the Westerners missing since1985.   The magazine, based in Christian east Beirut, quoted an unnamedHezbollah official as saying: ``The scenario is being set for therelease.'' The short report gave no other details.   The weekly Al-Shiraa reported this week that the case of theforeign hostages ``has been put on a hot burner.'' While themagazine gained international fame when it broke the story of secretU.S. arms sales to Iran in November 1987, subsequent reports on thehostages have not proved accurate.   ``This could result in releasing them ... in the light of adecision to this effect adopted by regional powers interested inthis case,'' Al-Shiraa said without elaboration.   There are 15 foreign hostages held in Lebanon, including nineAmericans.   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,1985.   The independent daily An-Nahar and the conservative Ad-Diyarreported today that the release of foreign captives in Lebanon waspart of an agreement mediated by Syria and Iran this week to end abloody inter-Shiite power struggle between Hezbollah and theSyrian-backed mainstream Amal militia.   ``Informed sources believe that the basic aim of theAmal-Hezbollah accord is to work on the release of foreign captivesheld in Lebanon,'' An-Nahar's terse report said.   Ad-Diyar, in an equally brief report, quoted an unnamed officialas saying the Amal-Hezbollah accord ``could result in the handingover of some foreign hostages to the Syrians.''   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. It has some 40,000troops controlling Moslem areas, including northern and easternprovinces as well as west and south Beirut.   The leftist daily As-Safir, which is close to the Syrian armycommand in Lebanon, said: ``Diplomatic information speaks of thepossible release of some (foreign) hostages in the next two weeks.''   The report said the issue ``will be the focus of attention in thecoming days. Recent reports about the possible release of Irishhostage Brian Keenan were indirect messages to the Americans and theBritons.'' It did not elaborate.   Keenan, of Northern Ireland, holds both Irish and Britishcitizenship.   A native of Belfast, Keenan was kidnapped April 11, 1986, as hewalked to his teaching job at the American University of Beirut.   Nabih Berri, leader of Amal, said in Damascus after the agreementwith Hezbollah was signed on Monday, ``The peace pact did not referdirectly to the hostages, but I am sure that this agreement wouldhelp (secure) the release of hostages as quickly as possible.''   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who negotiated onIran's behalf during the Damascus talks, said: ``Nobody will besatisfied with the holding of the hostages, so we do hope that allthe hostages ... will be released.''   Irish ambassador Patrick McCabe flew in from Baghdad last week toinvestigate reports that Keenan, 38, would be freed.   McCabe, who is ambassador to Lebanon and Iraq, said Wednesday hehoped the statements by Berri and Velayati would result in therelease of some foreign captives ``before too long.''   The 15 foreign captives missing in Lebanon are, in addition toKeenan and the Americans, three Britons, an Italian and a Belgian.</TEXT></DOC>
