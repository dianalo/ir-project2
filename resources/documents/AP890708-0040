(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors in the tax evasion trial ofJames and David Taggart have summoned the operators of some of theEast Coast's most exclusive shops to testify about purchases made bythe former PTL aides.   Cartier Inc. representative Gary Saage Jr. told jurors Fridaythat David Taggart bought several expensive items at the company'sNew York flagship store, including an $85,000 diamond and sapphirepin, and witnesses from other expensive shops, including Gucci,testified about other items including a $10,000 Rolex watch.   The Taggarts are charged with failing to pay $487,000 in incometaxes from 1984 to 1987. Federal prosecutors say they diverted $1.1million of ministry funds to their personal use by taking cashadvances on PTL credit cards and using blank ministry checks to paythe credit card bills.   All of the witnesses testified that their shops catered to thewealthiest U.S. consumers.   ``A person who shops in our store sort of doesn't ask theprice,'' said Frederick Bodner, who described the Taggarts asregular customers at his exclusive clothing shop in Palm Beach, Fla.   In other testimony, the former executive secretary to PTL founderJim Bakker said she once forged Bakker's signature, at the directionof David Taggart, on a memo that turned a $45,000 loan into a$45,000 bonus.   Shirley Fulbright said the memo gave her a $90,000 bonus, $45,000of which was used to pay off the loan.   David Taggart had used a similar forged memo for loans of hisown, she said.   Earlier Friday, a tax attorney testified that missing records andhuge salaries paid to PTL leaders made it difficult for him todefend the ministry's tax-exempt status in the face of InternalRevenue Service questioning.   ``I felt their tax exemption was in jeopardy,'' Michael Wigtontestified. ``I felt they needed to have some effective answers.''   He said one of his biggest concerns was excessive compensation.   ``The distinction is when insiders or controlling parties usedtheir power to use non-exempt money for their own purposes,'' hesaid.   Wigton, a former IRS specialist in exempt organizations who isnow in private practice, was retained by PTL in late 1985 to fightthe IRS's proposed revocation of PTL's tax-exempt status.   The IRS action stemmed from an audit of PTL for the years1981-1983.   Wigton testified under questioning by prosecutor David Brown thathe was unable to obtain documents on credit card cash advances andAmerican Express charges that dealt specifically with David Taggart.   He described one incident in which he was unable to get AmericanExpress receipts. A set of copies he requested from the credit cardcompany was lost at PTL, he said. A second set of copies also wasreported lost by PTL officials, he said.   ``They just disappeared,'' said Wigton.   Most of the missing records had to do with travel expenses andother charges incurred by David Taggart, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
