Well, you be the judge.    Deborah Steelman, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget, recently decided that the government needs &quot;a single word for 'slowing the rate of growth.'&quot; This is important, she explained, because OMB often gets blamed for cutting programs, when, in fact, it's just slowing the growth of spending. So, she staged a contest to pick a word.    In a memo to her staff, Ms. Steelman quickly ruled out one popular possibility -- &quot;deincrease&quot; -- as sounding too bureaucratic. Instead, she wrote in the contest description, the word &quot;should be short and easy to remember, natural to the tongue.&quot; She offered to take the person who submitted the best entry to lunch in the White House mess, which, outside of the Pentagon, is one of the best places in Washington to hear bureaucratic patois.    The entries poured in: &quot;decelerate,&quot; &quot;arrest,&quot; &quot;temper,&quot; &quot;check,&quot; &quot;curb,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;rein in,&quot; &quot;decrement,&quot; and &quot;Reaganize.&quot; The last entry, its proponent explained, is a transitive verb meaning &quot;to slow the rate of growth in a program, esp. a federal program.&quot;    Other entries included &quot;55&quot; (to reduce from a faster speed), &quot;Strog&quot; (an acronym for slowing the rate of growth), and &quot;harness.&quot; Harnessing spending has a &quot;horsy sort of ring to it, and the president likes horses,&quot; noted the entrant who submitted that word.    The contest wasn't without irony. The Reagan administration itself has played fast and loose with the word &quot;cut.&quot; Administration officials often complain that Congress &quot;cut&quot; the military budget even when they're referring to times when lawmakers approved increases that were smaller than the president had requested.    The winning word in Ms. Steelman's contest was &quot;slug,&quot; an acronym for slowing upward growth. John Schall, the OMB staffer who won, wrote in his entry: &quot;Wouldn't you love to slug your favorite federal programs?&quot;    But one of Ms. Steelman's deputies, Barbara Selfridge, still likes &quot;deincrease.&quot; &quot;It would make English-lovers cringe,&quot; she wrote, &quot;thusly meeting the criteria that determines whether the Federal Government will take it to its heart -- along with such other all-time favorites as 'negative outlays,' 'impacts,' 'at this point in time,' and 'true facts.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
