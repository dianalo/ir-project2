Lawrence Garrett III told Congress he plans to reorganize theNavy information resources management department.andM;Garrett told the House Government Operations National Security andLegislation Subcommittee he will create a new office to oversee ADPprocurements and ensure competition.andM;The Navy's top IRM official, Rear Adm.andP;  Paul E. Tobin Jr., will report to anew assistant Navy secretary for research, development and acquisitions,Garrett said.andP;  Tobin now reports to the assistant secretary for financialmanagement.andP;  No one has been named to the new position.andM;Garrett also said he has directed Navy Undersecretary J. Daniel Howard tofollow Navy ADP acquisitions personally.andM;Rep.andP;  Frank Horton (R-N.Y.), ranking minority member of the GovernmentOperations Committee, said he was impressed with Garrett's response.andP;  He saidhe believed the changes Garrett plans to make will catch most of the problemsthe hearings have brought out.andM;Garrett's testimony followed six days of hearings by the House GovernmentOperations Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security into allegationsthat Navy officials have skewed procurements to favor IBM Corp. equipment.andM;Although the hearings did not prove Navy corruption or an illegal bias towardIBM products, a committee staff member said the testimony showed the Navy'sinability to handle large acquisitions ethically and responsibly.andM;Horton asked Garrett whether the Navy had considered disbarring or suspendingIBM.andP;  Garrett said Navy officials had not considered it but would do so ifrequested by the committee.andM;After the hearing, Horton said he was unsure whether the committee would seeksuch an action.andM;The hearings, convened by committee chairman Rep.andP;  John Conyers Jr.andO;(D-Mich.), focused on contracts that the Navy has had to halt, cancel orrevise at the direction of the General Accounting Office or the GSA Board ofContract Appeals.andM;In one of the contracts, the Data Processing Installations EquipmentTransition Phase III (DPI-ET), the Navy's top IRM official went forward withthe procurement, despite advice from the Navy counsel that the buy would notstand up to protest scrutiny, according to testimony.andM;Rear Adm.andP;  Harry S. Quast, who retired last year as director of Navy IRM,approved a single procurement for six configurations of ADP equipment.andP;  MarkR. Wiener, counsel to the Source Selection Advisory Council for DPI-ET, saidhe told Quast the buy was non-competitive if left as a single acquisition.andM;&quot;My recommendation on the request for proposals as structured was that oursolicitation should be structured in a different manner than it was,&quot; Wienersaid.andP;  &quot;I believed as intended by the Naval Data Automation Command [NAVDAC]that the way it was structured should be changed.andP;  I did not believe NAVDACwould be able to succeed in defending it as competitive.&quot;andM;Quast told the subcommittee he sought advice from the ADP Selection Office(ADPSO) and the Navy competition advocate on the DPI-ET procurement.andP;  Theselection office told him the procurement should be broken up into severalparts to enhance competition.andM;ADPSO officials said some of the low-end equipment requirements mightrestrict competition.andP;  But NAVDAC wanted a single procurement because itwould make contract management easier, he said.andM;The competition advocate advised Quast that a single procurement would becompetitive, Quast said.andM;Later the GSBCA halted the procurement and directed the Navy to rewrite thespecifications and break up the acquisition.andP;  A revised requirements analysisin January showed no need for the low-end machines, Horton said.andM;GSA since has rescinded the delegation of procurement authority for DPI-ET.andM;The Navy has not acted further on DPI-ET, but a panel appointed by Garrettconcluded the buy favored IBM and should be broken up, Garrett said.andM;The competition advocate's office may not have known about the problems withDPI-ET, said Michael E. Motley, the associate director for research,development, acquisition and procurement issues in GAO's National Securityand International Affairs Division.andM;&quot;There are some instances where the advocate office offered suggestions toreduce restrictions in procurements,&quot; Motley said.andM;But the complaints system was so poor that these instances are few and theadvocate has no way of judging trends of problems or in recognizing problems,he said.andM;The Navy is working to put in a system to track complaints, Motley said.andM;The subcommittee also found that NAVDAC was unable to prepare its ownpre-solicitation documentation and used an irregular funding method to obtainhelp from an Energy Department subcontractor.andM;The Navy may have violated the Competition in Contracting Act by transferingfunds to DOE to obtain DPI-ET support services from Applied ManagementSciences Inc. of Silver Spring, Md., said James D. Watts of the Navy AuditService.andM;Watts said the Navy transferred about $325,000 to DOE to hire AppliedManagement, a subcontractor to Martin Marrietta Corp. Martin Marrietta paidApplied Management about $220,000 and kept $100,000 as a management fee,Watts said.andM;But the services Applied Management performed for te Navy were so common theNavy should have bid them competitively, Watts said, adding that the Navyalso could have saved the $100,000.andM;Further, Government Operations staff members said the assignments performedby Applied Management were intrinsic government functions that NAVDACofficials, not contract staff, should have handled.andM;The staff members also suggested the specifications were slanted because theywere based on restrictive information provided by NAVDAC.andM;One of the six vendors whose letter to then-Defense Secretary Frank Carluccispurred the investigation testified IBM had undue influence throughoutDPI-ET.andP;  The influence occurred through contacts between one of IBM's salesrepresentatives, marketing manager Peggy H. Landini, and John Siegrist, aformer NAVDAC official and member of the DPI-ET selection committee, thevendor testified.andM;Siegrist denied providing Landini with any special materials, though headmitted some information she had was sensitive but incorrect on certainpoints.andP;  Landini said she only provided the Navy with draft specifications.andM;Both Siegrist and Landini said their 1986 meetings and Siegrist's attendanceat an IBM training course occurred before he had been named to the selectioncommittee and while the Navy was doing a marker survey of available products.andM;The committee intensely scrutinized IBM training programs in San Jose, Clif.,andO;that Navy employees attended at no charge.andM;Navy officials should not have approved the training sessions and should haveconsidered them unetical gratuities under Navy and Defense Departmentstandards, said Roger R. McNamara, the Navy's assistant general counsel onethics.andM;&quot;Nevertheless, my opinion is not controlling.andP;  The Navy regulation vests thedetermination as to the best interests of the government in the hands of theapropriate supervisor,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;This is consistent with fundamental fairness, inasmuch as individuals whoproceeded to attend training in good faith pursuant to those supervisorydeterminations should not be penalized for the incorrect judgment of theirsupervisors.&quot;andM;McNamara said the training was a gratuity because it was promotional.andO;Siegrist and IBM attorneys disagreed and noted the regulations allowedpromotional training if government officials decide the training is in thebest interest of the agency.andM;The six vendors who complained to then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci inNovember of last year, and whose initial letter touched off the committeeinvestigation, are Amdahl Corp., NCR Comten, Storage Technology Corp.,andO;Memorex Telex Corp., PacifiCorp Capital Corp. and Vion Corp.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
