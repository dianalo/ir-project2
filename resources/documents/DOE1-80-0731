The effort investigated severalanomalous boiler performance areas dealing with non-steady and off-designboiler operation and included measurements of volatile and semi-volatileorganics in the flue gas as well as the fate of some heavy metals introducedinto the system. The tests were performed at pilot scale and investigatedhysteresis effects, phenomena detected during earlier full-scale testing.These hysteresis effects are defined as the propensity for a boiler toretain certain organic components of the feed material (beyond the durationto a typical sampling protocol), to be released over a longer time framein an unspecific manner. The effort attempted to identify the presenceof these effects beyond random variation, background concentration andsampling problems such as sample contamination. These tests were partiallysuccessful at characterizing hysteresis phenomena as well as establishinga qualitative significance of these effects on the accuracy of DRE andother performance measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
