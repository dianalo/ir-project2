<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0906 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method to prepare the films of the compounds of the system (AgI-Ag/sub4/P/sub 2/O/sub 7/) by electrodeposition is described. The films weredeposited by the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of (HI + H/sub 4/P/sub2/O/sub 7/). The composition and the properties of the films depositedwere found to vary with various parameters like composition of the electrolyte,temperature at which electrolysis is carried out, current density, timeof electrolysis and the pH of the electrolyte. These parameters werechanged systematically and the corresponding parameters for depositingstable-hihgly conducting films were evaluated. The activation energyfor migration of silver ion is evaluated from the conductivity studies.From the values of conductivity, activation energy for migration andthe X-ray data the composition of the film of stable and highly conductingfilm may be written as Ag/sub 16/I/sub 12/P/sub 2/O/sub 7/.</TEXT></DOC>
