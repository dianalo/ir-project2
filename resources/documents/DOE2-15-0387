<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0387 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computerized consultation service developed by the Reproductive ToxicologyCenter, Washington, DC, provides summaries of the literature on morethan 1300 chemical and physical agents. During the first five years ofoperation, the service was used to evaluate exposures in 1089 individuals.Only 3% of the exposures involved men. Of the 1053 exposed women, 85%were pregnant and 8% were planning pregnancy. In this latter group, potentiallyhazardous exposures were reported in 17%. Pregnant women were primarilyexposed to medications, although exposures to chemicals at work and inthe home constituted other important sources of inquiries. Excludingethanol and tobacco, 19% of pregnant women were exposed to agents thatare known or probable reproductive toxins. Ethanol exposure occurredin 27% of the sample and tobacco use was reported in 13%. These findingssuggest that even women concerned about exposure to agents during pregnancycommonly use known or probable reproductive toxins. Physician accessto reproductive toxicology information and patient education will benecessary to reduce these exposures.</TEXT></DOC>
