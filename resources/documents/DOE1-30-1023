This is to be achieved by using a gas-fluidized bed whose particulatefraction consists of a moist mass of microorganisms (especially speciesof Saccharomyces). The fluidized particles are sprayed with a broth offermentable carbohydrates, e.g. hydrolyzed starch and/or broths containinghydrolyzed cellulose. The fermentation conditions are controlled by thetemperature and by the oxygen partial pressure of the gas flowing continuouslyinto the fluidized bed. The ethanol/water mixture is separated from thegas released by the fluidized particles in cooling and fractionationmodules and is processed further. The biomass and the residual, non-fermentedsubstrate are removed from the fluidized bed in the form of moist granulate,and the granulate is dried to the desired residual moisture.</TEXT></DOC>
