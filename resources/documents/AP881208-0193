Armenian journalists said a Politburo commission led by PremierNikolai I. Ryzhkov received preliminary estimates that up to 50,000people died in the Wednesday earthquake, which measured 6.9 on theRichter scale. Soviet officials reported thousands of people werekilled but provided no death toll.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut short his trip to the UnitedStates and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort insouthern republic, which has a population of 3.3 million.   ``Urgent measures are being taken to help all those affected bythis terrible tragedy, and I have to be there in this effort,'' saidGorbachev, who planned to fly to Yerevan after arriving in Moscow.He canceled planned trips to Cuba and Britain.   President Reagan offered emergency humanitarian aid, CubanPresident Fidel Castro pledged to sent construction workers andBritain dispatched London firefighters to join the rescue effort.   Soviet TV showed a clock on a building in the city of Leninakan,on the Turkish border near the epicenter of the earthquake, stoppedat 11:41 _ the instant the disaster struck.   The earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Leninakan, Armenia'ssecond-largest city with a population of 250,000 people, a TVcorrespondent said.   Spitak, a town of 16,000 about 45 miles away, ``was practicallyerased from the face of the Earth,'' the correspondent said.   Tass said half the buildings in Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, hadcrumbled.   A special meeting of representatives of all 15 Soviet republicswas called in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on Friday to discussdisaster relief.   Soviet authorities dispatched doctors, engineers and food andmedical supplies to the area, and a ``helicopter bridge'' was set upto ferry the injured northward to hospitals in neighboring SovietGeorgia, the Tass news agency reported.   Tass said 2,300 people were hospitalized in Yerevan with injuriesfrom the quake and that 200 had been hospitalized across the borderin Georgia. It did not say how many of the injured were treatedelsewhere.   For a second night Thursday, millions of Soviet TV viewers sawsoldiers searching for survivors and bodies in huge piles ofconcrete rubble, either by hand or with cranes. The disastercoverage by the state-run media was unprecedented in its speed andscope.   Ryzhkov, head of an earthquake commission, told Soviet televisionthe main task before authorities is to search the rubble for theinjured and dead.   He then turned directly toward the camera and made an unusualappeal to factory and business officials nationwide not to wait tobe asked, but to start immediately sending heavy cranes, helicoptersand other equipment to the stricken area.   Friday and Saturday were declared days of mourning in Armenia.   Soviet TV and the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported fromLeninakan that preliminary estimates were that tens of thousands ofpeople were killed.   Foreign Minister spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said authorities werehaving difficulty calculating a death toll because communicationswith the region were severed.   He said the Foreign Ministry was reviewing requests by foreignreporters to visit the disaster area, but that none had beenapproved.   Komsomolskaya Pravda said soldiers were working under spotlightsin the wreckage of a Leninakan school. It said two sergeants pulledthe bodies of more than 50 children from the ruins and that only afew children had been found alive in the collapsed building.   Blood donations were being collected throughout the Soviet Unionfor quake victims. Tons of blankets, field kitchens, tents andmedicine were pouring into the region, Tass said.   Soldiers were setting up tent cities to house evacuees in thedevastated regions, and restoring electricity and water supplies,army Gen. Vladimir Arkhipov told Tass. Bonfires burned in theshattered cities to warm the homeless in the December chill.   The newspaper Izvestia reported the population of Armenia hasrisen markedly in recent weeks as settlers fled violent ethnicstrife between Armenians, who are mostly Christian, andpredominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis.   About 180,000 refugees reportedly have fled across the borderbetween the two republics in the last three weeks.   The last earthquake in the Soviet Union with a death toll in thethousands was an Oct. 5, 1948, temblor in Ashkhabad, the capital ofTurkmenia. The Soviet press _ acting under Gorbachev's policy ofglasnost, or greater openness _ recently gave the death toll for theAshkhabad quake as 110,000.   A quake of 6.9 on the Richter scale is capable of causingwidespread damage. The scale is a measure of ground motion asrecorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means atenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects anearthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.</TEXT></DOC>
