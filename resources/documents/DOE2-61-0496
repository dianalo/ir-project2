<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-0496 </DOCNO><TEXT>In conventional storage tanks for crude oil and petroleum products, thetank bottoms are generally flat, and inflow/outflow pipes are conventionallyplaced ca 0.3-0.6 m above the tank bottom. This means that the entireinventory of stored liquid is not able to be drawn off. In addition,in tankage containing a floating roof for prevention of vapor loss, theroof is equipped with legs to support the roof when the tank is takenout of service; such legs are typically at least 1.3 m high, thereforethe inventory in such tankage must be at least 1.3 m deep in order toutilize the vapor-containing feature of the floating roof. The inventorythat is thus unavailable to be pumped represents a significant value,and conventional methods for upwardly displacing such inventory withinthe tank have proved to have disadvantages. This invention overcomessuch drawbacks by providing an apparatus for displacing inventory ofstored liquid in a tank having a wall and a substantially horizontalbottom, comprising a plurality of impervious bladders. Each bladder consistsof flexible top, bottom, and wall membranes, and means for filling saidbladder with flowable displacement material, preferably a liquid containingan inorganic salt, of greater density than the stored liquid. These bladdersare disposed so as to cover substantially the entire useable bottom ofthe tank. The invention also provides a method of displacing the storedliquid inventory using the above bladders. 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
