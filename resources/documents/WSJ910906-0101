Inc., the nation's largest marketer of oliveoil, with misrepresenting the health benefits of its productsin a spate of newspaper and magazine advertisements.   Under a consent agreement announced yesterday, the companyagreed -- without admitting any wrongdoing -- to stop makingfalse, misleading and unsubstantiated statements aboutseveral varieties of olive oil. The FTC yesterday alsosettled a similar case against Pacific Rice Products Inc.,which was accused of making unsubstantiated health claims forits Vita-Fiber Rice Bran cereal.</LP><TEXT>   The enforcement actions signaled the agency's new resolveto crack down on deceptive food advertising as vigorously asthe Food and Drug Administration has been cracking down ondeceptive food labeling. At the same time, the FTC servednotice that it won't allow food processors to makeunqualified health claims on the basis of preliminary andinconclusive nutritional studies.   &quot;These cases,&quot; said FTC Chairman Janet Steiger,&quot;underscore the seriousness with which the commission viewsdeceptive and misleading food advertising.&quot;   The FTC accused Bertolli of claiming &quot;without a reasonablebasis&quot; that consuming olive oil reduces blood pressure andblood sugar levels, and of misrepresenting that medicalscience confirms such claims. In addition, the agency allegedthat the Secaucus, N.J., company misrepresented the resultsof a study published last year in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association. Among other things, the FTC charged,Bertolli made false and misleading claims:   -- That olive oil is healthier than other cooking oils,when in fact the journal article qualified that finding,saying further study is required to confirm it.   -- That study participants who consumed the most oliveoil, a monounsaturated oil, had the lowest cholesterollevels, when in fact those who had the most polyunsaturatedoil in their diet actually had the lowest levels.   Bertolli, a subsidiary of the Italian company CirioBertolli deRica Societa Generale del Conserve AlimentariS.p.A., is the leading importer of olive oil, with a nearlyone-third share of the U.S. market in 1990. Its product lineincludes Bertolli Olive Oil Classico and Extra Light OliveOil.   In a separate complaint, the FTC challenged advertisingclaims by Pacific Rice Products, a closely held company basedin Woodland, Calif., that Vita-Fiber Rice Bran reducescholesterol and helps reduce the risk of heart disease.Clinical studies, the agency said, don't substantiate suchclaims.   Robert Luke, vice president, marketing, for Pacific Rice,said the company believes Vita Fiber is &quot;a healthy foodproduct.&quot; He said fighting the government's claim didn't makesense because the company discontinued the product due to&quot;insufficient consumer demand&quot; earlier this year.   The company, as did Bertolli, settled the matter withoutadmitting any law violation. Both companies agreed to have &quot;acompetent and reliable scientific basis&quot; for any healthclaims in the future.</TEXT></DOC>
