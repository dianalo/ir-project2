The Derby it wasn't.   But as seven sisters swept along the track, the 8,000 spectatorsin a field at Trim 30 miles from Dublin shared excitement matchinganything the racegoers at Epsom will experience Wednesday duringBritain's most prestigious race.   Michael Regan, who organized the race to benefit the convents'chosen charities, had predicted, ``We'll have more nuns than `TheSound of Music.''' Sisters from more than a dozen orders around thecountry, dressed in their black and white habits and veils, cheeredas fervently as any other track fans as their favorites set off onthe one-mile course.   The racing nuns wore jodhpurs and safety helmets.   The horses, all borrowed from local owners, received temporarynames with an ecclesiastical flavor.   But despite morning prayers, things didn't go perfectly.   Sister Olive Irwin, a convent boarding school cook, had toscratch when her mount Nun Sense died a few minutes before thestart.   A horse called Mother Superior, to be ridden by Sister SebastianKennedy, didn't show up at the course at all.   Sister Annunciata McAuley tumbled off her 5-1 chance Sound ofMusic 20 yards out of the starting gate.   Eighty yards farther on, Sister Fiona Pryle from the nearby GoodShepherd Convent was left sitting on the track when Vatican Callingdecided she was too much for him.   Two more sisters hit the dirt around the back of the coursebefore the runaway leaders, Sister Ann Neylon and Sister PatrickMcDonnell, came back into sight in a neck-and-neck race.   Sister Ann, a 25-year-old Daughter of Charity from Dublin, wonby a neck over Sweet Divine, the 6-4 favorite, edging out5O-year-old Navan Mercy Convent schoolteacher Sister Patrick onDevil's Bit.   Bookmaker Michael Fitzgibbon had worked out the odds beforehandby studying the nuns rather than the horses as the ladies arrivedat the course.   ``It's one race where I am relying entirely on the weight of thejockeys for my judgment,'' he said.   ``There are some hefty sisters there who will never stay onboard,'' he predicted accurately.   Sister Ann, a stablehand before she took her vows, gave creditfor her win to the prayers of her sisters.   ``They were praying all week for me back at the convent,'' shesaid.   Sister Ann's $1,857 first prize goes to her favorite charity, aDublin inner-city youth project. A local school is to benefit fromsponsoring the event.</TEXT></DOC>
