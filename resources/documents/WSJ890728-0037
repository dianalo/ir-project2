The electronics concern said profit fell to $12.97 million, or 37 cents a share, from $52.80 million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $300.81 million from $314.87 million. Fiscal 1989 net fell 71% to $36.35 million on a 1.1% drop in revenue to $1.08 billion.    The company attributed its lackluster bottom line to its Raynet subsidiary, which had a $15 million loss in the quarter and $55.07 million in the year. Raynet, a relatively new unit that designs fiber-optics systems, had a loss because it is still developing products and markets, a spokesman said. Raychem is seeking outside investment in the unit.    Raychem also blamed slimmer profit margins caused by a shift in its sales away from military buyers to civilian aircraft and automobile customers, where profits are thinner. The shift has caused factory overcapacity in some products, it said.    Raychem's marginal effective tax rate -- 26% in fiscal 1988 -- climbed to 43% in the third quarter of 1989, which affected net income, the company said. And a strengthening dollar cut profit on overseas sales, which make up about 60% of the company's revenue, it said.    Raychem, which makes wires, cables and connectors for a broad range of industries, said it expects revenue to grow 5% to 10% in fiscal 1990. Development outlays at Raynet will reduce fiscal 1990 pre-tax profit about $60 million, it said.    Raychem's shares closed yesterday at $35.25, down 25 cents on New York Stock Exchange trading. </TEXT></DOC>
