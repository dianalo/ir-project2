As to Bulgaria, since I have no comments to makeregarding the other five countries, the author may have beenmisled because large territories of today's Yugoslavia usedto be part of Bulgaria and as late as the beginning of thiscentury the predominance of the Bulgarian ethnic elementthere was undisputed.</LP><TEXT>   As far as Bulgaria's government is concerned, however, Ican state that there have been no territorial claims madeagainst Yugoslavia. The firm belief of my governmentreflected in numerous official policy statements is that itis solely up to the Yugoslav peoples to exercise their rightsto self-determination and to decide freely upon their future.   It is trivial to say that the national and ethnic problemsof the region are deeply rooted in history. What I thinkshould not be missed is that some of them were made even morecomplicated by the policies applied by the internationalcommunist movement on the national and ethnic issues. Now,when in Bulgaria the emerging democracy is overcoming thelegacies of the totalitarian past, we are convinced that thesolution of these burning problems can be made only bypeaceful and democratic means and with due account of thehistoric realities.   I would be inclined to support the conclusion, made byChristopher Cviic, an expert at London's Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs, and quoted in your article: &quot;WhileYugoslavia used to worry about its neighbors, now itsneighbors worry about Yugoslavia.&quot;   Ognian Pishev   Ambassador   Republic of Bulgaria Washington</TEXT></DOC>
