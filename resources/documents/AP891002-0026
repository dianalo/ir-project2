ISBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>FORREST CITY, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's a body, evidence, and asuspect. But Arkansas and Tennessee authorities can't agree whoshould investigate the death of a former women's collegiatebasketball star.   The body of Joel Tillis, who played basketball at NortheastLouisiana University, was found June 11 in a ditch near ForrestCity, about 25 miles from the state line. But she may have died inMemphis.   ``I'm wondering if they are thinking of her as a nobody,'' saidMarliss Bates of Hammond, La., who last saw her daughter when shecame home for Mother's Day.   ``Had Joel been some prominent person's daughter ... would ithave made a difference then? Was Joel just another black child?''   Authorities in St. Francis County, Ark., contend Ms. Tillis, 24,was slain in a Memphis apartment and her body then dumped in theditch beside U.S. 70, halfway between Forrest City and Memphis.   ``We have simply pursued all the leads that we have, andeverything to us points back to Memphis, Tennessee,'' said SheriffDave Parkman, who forwarded the case file to police in theTennessee city in August. ``We just cannot resolve a murder here inthis county that happened someplace else.''   But Capt. Ken East, commander of the Memphis homicide division,said he isn't about to take over the investigation.   ``It is his case, it has been his case and it will continue tobe his case,'' East said. ``Unless it can be proved that a homicideoccurred here, which it cannot be proved at this time, then itstays where it is found.''   The discovery of Ms. Tillis' badly decomposed body came a littlemore than two years after the body of her best friend and formerteammate, 18-year-old Brenda Spicer, was found in a trash bin onthe Monroe, La., college campus. Both women were strangled.   Ms. Tillis' boyfriend, Ivrin Bolden, who shared a Memphisapartment with her until her disappearance in May, is a primesuspect in the Tillis case, Parkman said.   Bolden was acquitted of second-degree murder in the 1987 deathof Ms. Spicer, with Ms. Tillis testifying on his behalf.   On May 19, he reported to Memphis police that Ms. Tillis wasmissing and that he last saw her the previous day, when he droppedher off for work as an assistant manager at a Lady Foot Locker shoestore.   But Ms. Tillis' boss told police the young woman never showed upfor work that day.   Shortly after Ms. Tillis' disappearance, Bolden was questionedby Memphis police, but he since has left Tennessee and was lastreported living in Florida.   Parkman said investigators have learned Ms. Tillis and Boldenargued the day she disappeared. But Parkman said he neverquestioned Bolden.   ``I think Bolden should be interviewed,'' Parkman said. ``But Idon't think we have enough to do that in this county. I don't thinkwe have enough evidence and information on Bolden to initiatepicking him up.''   Bolden declined comment recently, saying, ``I know my name isbeing bounced around a lot up there, but my attorney has advised menot to say anything.''   St. Francis County officials know Ms. Tillis was dead when herbody was dumped in the ditch, Parkman said. They also have learnedBolden and Ms. Tillis owned rose-colored sheets like the ones foundwrapped around her body, and crime lab reports indicate fibersfound on the sheets and on Ms. Tillis' clothing matched carpetfibers in the Memphis apartment, Parkman said.   Parkman also said police have established a motive, but he wouldnot disclose it.   Memphis chief of detectives Fred Warner said his departmentwon't take the case unless there's conclusive evidence the crimeoccurred in Memphis.   He denied the mother's implication that authorities are draggingtheir feet because Ms. Tillis was black. Ninety percent of thepeople killed in Memphis this year were black, Warner said, and91.8 percent of homicides were solved.</TEXT></DOC>
