Damaging tornadoes struck in Alabama andGeorgia.   Schools were closed by snow in six states.   The weekend snowstorm developed from a cold front out of theNorthwest and sent heavy snow to the southern Plains. Today, thewintry weather stretched from eastern Oklahoma to southeastern NewYork state.   Severe thunderstorms along a cold front raked the Southeast withrain and golf ball-size hail and produced tornadoes that destroyed aGeorgia motel and killed one person in a mobile home Sunday night.   The bad weather also was blamed for 11 other deaths, includingtwo children killed in an house fire in Alabama ignited by lighting.   Heavy rain caused flooding in Tennessee and West Virginia.   The heaviest snowfall was in Oklahoma, where 16 inches fell inthe Pauls Valley area south of Oklahoma City. Pauls Valley policechief Robert Nichols said the snow had ``drifted halfway up thedoor.''   Eastern Missouri got up to 14 inches of snow, the heaviest snowsince a 10-inch snowfall in 1958 and the fourth heaviest on record.   The Missouri State Senate canceled today's session, motoristswere stranded and the roofs of four businesses collapsed in Noel,near Springfield.   Up to 11 inches fell in northern Texas and part of the roof ofthe fire station at Bowie, 70 miles northwest of Fort Worth,collapsed when wind piled the snow into drifts of up to 7 feet.   Schools were closed today in parts of Arkansas, Indiana,Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Ohio.   Heavy rain caused flooding that forced the evacuation of morethan 300 people in Tennessee, including 200 Girl Scouts who weremoved from their camp in Cheatham County as a precaution, saidCounty Executive Vernon Knight.   The rain also pushed streams out of their banks across southernWest Virginia today, closing roads in 10 counties, canceling schoolin three and forcing some evacuations in Kanawha and Lincolncounties, state and local officials said.   Temperatures dipped to record lows early today in Port Arthur,Texas, 24; Shreveport, La., 24, and Wichita Falls, Texas, 15.   Blowing snow brought traffic to a crawl or made travel nearlyimpossible in many areas.   In Ardmore, Okla., 328 motorists spent the night in the NationalGuard Armory and the city's civic auditorium after being unable totravel any further on Interstate 35, said Civil Defense DirectorJames Mercer.   ``I've got a lobby full of people wanting rooms, and I'm full andit's blowing like crazy,'' said Mary Martin of the Green CountryMotel in Sallisaw, Okla. ``They can't hold their trucks and vehicleson the highway.''   Crews worked around the clock at Dallas-Forth Worth InternationalAirport, where snow cut Sunday's air traffic by about 50 percent.Flights were being returned to normal today, said American Airlinesspokeswoman Mary O'Neil said.   At St. Louis, Mo., Trans World Airlines canceled all of itsflights, incoming and outgoing, at Lambert airport this morning.Since TWA represents more than 85 percent of the traffic at theairport, the move virtually shut it down.   Tulsa (Okla.) International Airport closed every 20 minutes soplows could clear the main runway, said operations coordinator RogerBlickensderfer.   One of three tornadoes that touched down southwest of Atlantalate Sunday heavily damaged about five houses, destroyed an EconoLodge motel in Newnan and damaged a Holiday Inn, the weather service.
