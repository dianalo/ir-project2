(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE 80386 UNIX WARSandM;It really wasn't that long ago that the phrase &quot;microcomputer UNIX&quot; elicitedstifled giggles from all but the most devoted users.andP;  Now UNIX is enteringits prime, and one element figures prominently in this resurgence: the Intel80386.andP;  This was the first Intel CPU truly suited to UNIX.andP;  Its 32-bit datapath, memory protection, and huge virtual address space went to waste underDOS, but brought smiles to those who had been waiting for a fast, affordableUNIX architecture.andM;Producing UNIX for the 80386 has become a lucrative (and crowded) field.andP;  Atlast count there were no fewer than ten companies offering UNIX or UNIX-likeoperating systems for the 80386.andP;  Two such firms have emerged from the packto establish themselves as market leaders: Interactive Systems Corp. (SantaMonica, CA) and the Santa Cruz Operation Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).andP;  For yearsSCO Xenix has been the de facto UNIX for Intel processors.andP;  With versionsspanning the entire evolutionary path from the 8088 to the 80386, the Xenixline is the veteran of this market.andM;ISC is no child, either, and managed to one-up SCO by quickly releasingATandamp;T's latest creation--System V/386 Release 3.2--as a product.andP;  Once itreached the market it proved its worth, and 3.2 was hurriedly embraced byother players, including SCO.andP;  Now this &quot;real UNIX&quot; shares the limelight withXenix at SCO.andP;  ISC, armed with 386/ix version 2.0, and SCO, with its UNIXSystem V/386, are both digging in for what promises to be a long, bloodybattle.andP;  It is these two products that will be examined in this review.andM;Details of what System V Release 3.2 is all about can be gleaned from severalsources.andP;  The purpose of this review is to compare the features thatdifferetiate the ISC and SCO products.andP;  In addition to the base operatingsystem, the following components were obtained from both vendors: a Csoftware development system, the X Windows version 11 development system, andVP/ix MS-DOS emulation.andM;The products were installed on a pair of Siva 386 computers from VNS AmericaCorp. (Marlborough, MA).andP;  The VNS machines sport 20 MHz VNS motherboards, 8MB of RAM, and 300 MB SCSI hard disks driven by Adaptec AHA-1540Acontrollers.andP;  Each system uses a Paradise VGA Plus-16 display adapter.andP;  ALogitech serial mouse and an Archive 125 MB tape drive round out each system.andM;It should be noted that the SCO product provided for review was still in itsbeta-test phase and judged (by SCO) as not yet ready for release.andP;  Readers,therefore, should keep in mind that there are typically many improvementsbetween the beta and final releases; that's what beta-testing is for.andM;Hardware ConsiderationsandM;One factor which sets these versions of UNIX apart from their predecessors isthe broad range of device support that has been added.andP;  Limits on massstorage have been keeping microcomputers out of the UNIX business for years,but that's about to change.andP;  80386 UNIX users can choose from any of MFM,RLL, ESDI, and SCSI formats, opening up a wide range of storage densities andtransfer speeds.andP;  MFM (or ST-506), the &quot;IBM XT standard&quot;, is the oldest andslowest of the lot.andP;  RLL was introduced as a stopgap, providing higherdensity and some increase in data-transfer speed.andP;  ESDI and SCSI top the&quot;most desirable&quot; list for thier combined storage density and transfer speed.andO;ESDI is quite popular these days, and is often the default format for 80386systems packaged with large drives.andP;  This aside, SCSI should not be ruledout.andP;  It is fast, device-independent (even non-disk devices like tape drives,scanners, and film printers can be connected) and highly expandable.andM;Systems using the 80386 are typically shipped with one or two megabutes ofmemory.andP;  UNIX can run in 2 MB, but most serious work (including softwaredevelopment) will go more smoothly with 4 MB or more.andP;  Likewise, users withambitious plans for their systems should count on configuring at least 60 MBof hard disk.andM;Display adapters can be of the CGA, VGA, EGA, Hercules monochrome, orIBM-compatible monochrome text variety.andP;  All standard IBM-type displayadapters are &quot;dump&quot;, that is, no intelligence exists on the card for doinganything but displaying data placed in video memory by the host.andP;  (Note: VGAcards do have some intelligence for handling panning and split screens, butthese functions are rarely used.andP;  SCO X11 is an exception; for details, seebelow.)andP;  CGA, EGA, and VGA are all color standards, but some variations arecapable of driving monochrome monitors.andP;  The CGA's low resolution (320 x 200,4 colors) has rendered it all but obsolete, and EGA cards (640 x 350, 16colors) have moved in to replace them.andM;VGA is the most modern and attractive of the lot, capable of deliveringresolutions up to 640 x 480 in 16 colors (from a palette of 256 K).andP;  Manyvendors have enhanced their VGA implementations, giving them displayresolutions as high as 1024 x 768, and expanding the choice of colors to 256for some modes.andP;  The strictly-monochrome alternatives are fast and cheap, andquite sufficient for those expecting to run nothing but text-basedapplications.andP;  Anyone wishing to tap into X11 or other graphics-orientedapplications would be well advised to shoot for the higher resolution of EGAor VGA.andP;  Beyond the standards mentioned here, buyers must tread carefully:any graphics card chosen must be capable of register-level hardware emulationof one of the accepted IBM standards--otherwise, UNIX will not boot properly.andM;Several types of tape-backup drives are supported, but while SCO ships avariety of drivers with its product, ISC provides support for Wangtek drivesonly.andP;  Other 386/ix-compatible drivers must be obtained from drivemanufacturers.andP;  This can mean frustrating delays, and not all vendors can becounted on to keep their drivers current with ISC's latest release.andP;  SCOincludes support for SCSI tape, while ISC's release notes mention that SCSItape support will be provided in the future.andM;DocumentationandM;If quality of documentation were the deciding factor for potential buyers,SCO could walk away with the market.andP;  Packaged in glossy, durable,triple-D-ring binders (8 x 9 inches), the look of the SCO manual set isimpressive, with contents to match.andP;  Virtually no element of the operatingsystem is left undescribed, and the cardstock section separators, clearcontents tables, and page-edge chapter markers make zooming in on anyspecific topic a breeze.andP;  SCO has taken text from the ATandamp;T and Berkeleymanuals and reformatted it to enhance readability.andP;  SCO-specific passageswere added directly to the appropriate pages, rather than simply lumpedtogether in a &quot;what's different&quot; section.andP;  While someone new to UNIX couldeasily be confounded by the sheer volume of information, there is very littlehere that would better have been left out.andM;True System V aficionados might be disappointed that SCO chose to stick withits Xenix-style mnemonic section names (such as ADM for administration, C forgeneral commands, and S for system calls/library functions) rather than adoptATandamp;T's &quot;1-2-3&quot; format.andP;  Even those who have worked exclusively with ATandamp;Tdocumentation will waste no time adjusting to SCO's well-thought-outabbreviations.andM;The X11 received from SCO was actually a small subset of its future OpenDesktop bundle, and wasn't yet packaged for distribution.andP;  While everythingavailable at the time from MIT and the OSF was provided, it shed no light onwhat the manuals for the released X11 would look like.andM;Only SCO includes on-line documentation in the form of man pages.andP;  Berkeleyusers have long bemoaned the absence of this useful facility in System V, soSCO is sure to win many friends with its decision to include them.andM;Shipped in compressed format, they have surprisingly little impact on storaespace.andP;  The man pages are very complete, and the installation of thedevelopment system adds its own programmer's reference volumes.andP;  This makesan already excellent manual set nearly perfect.andM;Like many vendors of ATandamp;T-based UNIX, ISC includes only scant documentationwith its release, forcing customers to pay extra for the rest.andP;  On their own,the operating system manuals provided by ISC describe only those featuresthat are different from ATandamp;T's Release 3.2.andP;  The main and supplementaloperating system documentation appears in spiral-bound, paperback form.andP;  Onlylooseleaf makes real sense--updated material can be inserted, sections can beremoved or rearranged at will, and supplemental information (such as releasenotes and configuration data) can be punched and placed where it belongs.andO;Strangely, all three volumes of ISC's programmer's manual set (easily themost frequently read) are perfect-bound and will seldom lay flat on a tableunless you're fortunate enough to be reading from the center of the book.andM;Some ISC-specific portions of the manual set are incomplete.andP;  The VP/ix(MS-DOS under UNIX) manual includes no DOS or GW BASIC references, and thesendmail guide neglects to describe the steps needed to tie it in with UNIXmail and the public-domain smail routine that ISC provides.andP;  Similarly, theOS guide's installation section is lacking, with display shots that fail tofollow along with actual operation, and no mention of the action required ifsomething should go wrong.andM;Compared to its operating system documentation, ISC's X Window System manualsare quite an improvement.andP;  Two spiral-bound ISC volumes cover commands,interclient communication, and toolkit intrinsics.andP;  Most sections arereprints (except for the installation section) from MIT's Project Athenamanuals.andP;  MIT is the only source for some of this information, so ISC can'tbe faulted because some portions are tough to get through; the intrinsicsmanual, for instance, deserves an award for obfuscation.andP;  Themeat-and-potatoes Xlib (the X11 function library) guide and reference areprovided by O'Reilly andamp; Associates, and reading them is like having aknowledgeable friend lead you through a complex maze.andP;  They cover release 2,one behind that which ISC actually ships, but the hole is plugged by a set ofreprints from the X11 release 3 documentation.andP;  It's a usable combination.andO;As with SCO, ISC provided a &quot;snapshot&quot; of OSF/Motif software, and, again, themanuals for this not-yet-released product offer mere glimpses of what will bethe finished product.andM;ISC should take a lesson from the single thorough, well-written piece in itsmanual set: Ten/Plus User Interface Guide.andP;  The manual, like the software,serves both the novice, who may use this tool as insulation from the vagariesof UNIX, and the experienced user, for whom Ten/Plus is a good editor and aconvenient way to manipulate groups of files.andP;  A keyboard chart is providedon a card, and with it I was able to find my way through this package quicklyand easily.andM;InstallationandM;UNIX is fat, and it's gaining weight rapidly.andP;  Both ISC and SCO ship theirsoftware on 5-1/4-inch, high-density floppies (PS/2 customers will get3-1/2-inch disks), and SCO's OS component alone comprises more than 20 ofthese 1.2 MB diskettes.andP;  For both products, booting the system from a bootdiskette kicks off the install procedure, and an operational hard-disk UNIXcore is only about 30 to 45 minutes away.andP;  The greatest amount of interactionrequired involves swapping diskettes, and there is a blessed lot of that.andO;ISC dangles a singularly tantalizing prospect in front of the installerduring its installation procedure, asking: &quot;Are you loading the OS fromtape?&quot;andP;  I hope users will soon be able to answer &quot;yes&quot;.andM;Unfortunately, neither installation procedure was successful in convincing methat a novice could manage it.andP;  I will agree that a perfectly configured andprepared system can be installed with relative ease, but once troubleappears, it is no longer a game for the uninitiated.andM;While every entry-level DOS course teaches users to write-protect theirimportant floppies, ISC requires that the boot floppy be writable.andP;  ISCclaims in its OS manual that the MS-DOS diskcopy command may be used to makea duplicate of the boot floppy, but only a few releases of DOS can handlethis because of the way ISC formats the first track.andP;  Most users are,therefore, forced either to find another method or install with the originaldisk.andP;  When resorting to the latter solution, interrupting the install (whichis sometimes unavoidable) usually leaves the boot diskette damaged to thepoint of uselessness.andP;  Interrupts and errors both dump the user into theshell after a brief message describing the process for restarting theinstallation.andP;  While helpful, the message doesn't mention any way to shut thesystem down.andP;  Rebooting without shutting down can, and in my case always did,trash the boot disk.andP;  Eventually, I satisfied myself that a clean shutdowncan be accomplished with uadmin, but what newcomer would have known where tofind that?andM;ISC's 386/ix can be reinstalled from scratch, even over a previouslyinstalled UNIX (an aborted attempt, say).andP;  It is also possible to do anupdate of an existing system, leaving partitions, file systems, and non-OSfiles intact.andP;  If some error is made during an SCO install, the only way toretry it is to reformat the drive, which can take hours.andP;  Under 386/ix,partition sizes can be expressed either in percentages (such as &quot;10% DOS, 90%UNIX&quot;) or disk cylinders, giving new users a familiar way to split up a freshdisk.andP;  SCO's install utilities deal only with blocks, although each queryregarding disk space allocation is preceded by information about the size ofa block.andM;Once over the hurdle of base OS installation, adding optional softwaresubsets is a breeze.andP;  Both vendors offer a system administrator's shell ofsome sort; SCO's is glossier than ISC's and uses a colorful, full-screenformat, driven by Lotus-style horizontal menus.andP;  This carries with it thedrawback that only supported cursor-addressable terminals can be used to runSCO's administration routine.andM;ISC's sysadm program comes directly from ATandamp;T and has no terminal typerequirement.andP;  It, too, is menu-driven, and despite its comparative visualblandness is quite suitable for the tasks it performs.andP;  These shells are usedto install the non-core portions of UNIX, but also serve other administrativepurposes, which will be covered in more detail below.andM;Job ControlandM;The Berkeley C shell, a common extension to System V, appears in both ISC'sand SCO's product.andP;  Since BSD process suspension is missing, the C shell'sjob control is limited to maintaining a list of background jobs, and SCO'sshell lacks even that.andP;  The only replacement for this capability takes theform of multiple virtual screens.andP;  Both ISC's 386/ix and SCO's UNIX SystemV/386 support switching between separate sessions on the console through theuse of simple key combinations.andP;  Each session has its own off-screen displaymemory, which is updated in lieu of the physical display when another sessionis visible.andP;  When visible, a session occupies the entire screen and hasexclusive control of the keyboard and mouse.andM;Both products can jump from graphics to text and back again quiteimpressively, except under X11.andP;  SCO's X11 beta often has trouble making theswitch, in my experience, and sometimes the keyboard hangs up.andP;  386/ix, inturn, has problems of its own.andP;  For example, it dumps the display switch keysequence into whatever application happens to be running.andP;  Switching too fastcan also lock up 386/ix X11, but in any case killing the X Window serverprocess from a remote terminal releases the keyboard and restores the virtualdisplay system.andM;Each session remembers its video modes, so switching out of VP/ix graphicsapplications into text and back again is no problem.andP;  SCO carries this a stepfurther, making it possible for serial terminals to support multiple virtualsessions--an implementation that works best on terminals with more than onepage of display memory.andP;  Lastly, both SCO and ISC support the System V shelllayers facility, which will work on even the dumbest of terminals, and hasspecial extensions to support multiple windows on capable ATandamp;T graphicsterminals.andP;  Berkeley users will surely miss real job control, but after aperiod of adjustment they will find that the supplied alternatives are not sobad.andM;Accommodating DOSandM;Interactive Systems co-developed VP/ix, but SCO uses it as its MS-DOSemulator of choice as well, and with good reason: it works.andP;  Both vendorsprovide release 1.1, and operation and performance are identical.andP;  Fortesting purposes, I worked briefly with the few MS-DOS applications I hadavailable.andP;  The Supercalc spreadsheet came up quickly, and graphs were drawnusing the color capability of the VGA without problems.andP;  Scrolling, bothvertical and horizontal, was managed without sluggishness, &quot;snow&quot;, or othervisual faults.andP;  R:Base System V (which is not a UNIX package despite itsname) displayed its data briskly, and in no case did I notice trouble whenperforming any of the database operations.andP;  Both Borland Turbo C 2.0 andZortech C++ ran nicely, and the Dhrystone benchmark, compiled and optimizedwith Turbo, ran at 3300 per second.andP;  Under ordinary DOS, the same binaryreported 5000, illustrating the overhead of emulation under UNIX.andP;  Of course,it was easy to make the gap even wider by adding more UNIX or DOS processes.andO;While it may handle like a souped-up IBM AT, VP/ix only provides emulation ofthe 8086, breaking those programs which use 80286 or 80386-specificinstructions.andM;VP/ix can use any combination of genuine DOS partitions,dynamically-allocated virtual disks, and UNIX filesystems.andP;  While it ispossible to run multiple VP/ix sessions simultaneously, only one user mayhave write access to any virtual disk.andP;  Accessing UNIX filesystems is lessmanageable, given the archaic DOS filename convention of eight characters, amandatory dot, and a three-character extension.andP;  Obviously, there's no rightway to squeeze longer UNIX filenames into this format.andP;  The chosen methoddoes work, and the authors of VP/ix have tried to maintain some of thefilename's original appearance while ensuring its uniqueness.andP;  The ones thatfit fit, and the ones that don't are better off with a new name if you reallywant to use them with VP/ix.andM;Printing is not as simple or reliable as it is under DOS.andP;  The defaultsetting is to run all printed output through the UNIX print spooler.andP;  Usingthis, I found it difficult to produce reliable output.andP;  There were timeswhen, after printing from an application and selecting the &quot;flush printer&quot;option from the pop-up menu, no printed output appeared at all.andM;In addition to running DOS binaries, both vendors provide UNIX tools forworking with MS-DOS-formatted media.andP;  Files can be moved to or from bothfloppy and hard disks.andP;  SCO provides a set of DOS utilities (includingdosformat, doscp, dosmkdir) for managing file manipulation, and ISC blendsits utilities into a shell called dossette.andP;  Both allow devices to beaddressed with the familiar &quot;A:&quot; scheme.andP;  ASCII files can be reformattedwhile they are copied to compensate for the difference in line-endingcharacters.andM;System AdministrationandM;One of the difficulties in wooing potential UNIX users is the reportedcomplexity of its commands and the difficulty of system administration andmaintenance.andP;  With the two products reviewed, we have two divergentapproaches to solving this problem.andM;ISC chose the ATandamp;T method, a simple, boring-looking menu system calledsysadm.andP;  Looks aren't everything, though, and once acquainted with thisutility even experienced users will take advantage of it.andP;  Each menu ispresented tersely but clearly, and every numeric option is paired with akeyword.andP;  Nearly every administrative task can be performed either bynavigating through the menu tree or by entering the unique keyword on thesysadm command line.andP;  The chosen operation is then performed by aninteractive shell script.andP;  Almost no care has been taken to ensureconsistency in these scripts, but most are workable for those with littleUNIX knowledge.andM;One of the most striking aspects of this utility is its extensibility.andO;Layered products, applications, and device drivers, once loaded, canintegrate their maintenance functions into sysadm.andP;  Once VP/ix is loaded, forinstance, a new option quietly appears in the package management menu,completely automating the tasks involved in adding users and setting upconfiguration files.andP;  X11 would have been very difficult to configure withoutthe menu items added by its installation procedure.andP;  This method's usefulnessis a product of its simplicity, and it would be hard to ask for more in asystem administration utility.andM;SCO delivers heartily on special effects in its system administration tool,sysadmsh.andP;  Its name is similar to its ISC counterpart's, but that's where thesimilarity ends.andP;  As mentioned above, this is a sexy, full-screen utilitythat purports to end the drudgery of system management.andP;  It is wonderful tolook at, granted--but on examination, I found that half of it is wellconceived and well executed, while the rest just doesn't seem to belong.andM;Here, too, the user is presented with a menu.andP;  In this case, it is arrangedas rows of keywords, with the current selection highlighted in reverse video.andO;As new selections are highlighted, a one-line description of each item'saction appears at the bottom of the display.andP;  Unlike ISC's sysadm, SCO'sshell has much more built-in intelligence and can process full-screen inputforms.andP;  While traditional administrative tasks can be performed from themenu, the preponderance of its functionality rests in more ordinary,non-administrative functions like file viewing and electronic mail.andP;  While Idon't automatically shun the use of aids for jobs such as these, thegeneral-purpose shell functions end up clogging the menu tree, making theshell's use as an administrative tool frustrating at best.andM;The shell does show several interesting design traits, though.andP;  Full-screeninput forms are implemented nicely, and a pop-up window appears if syntaxerrors are made.andP;  A context-sensitive help system exists, too, mapped to theDOS-familiar F1 key.andP;  Repeated pressing of F1 will move the user deeper intothe help system, following threads of &quot;see also&quot; references.andP;  This, too, isdone in a pop-up window, so the underlying display is restored when help isfinished.andP;  I expect the interface elements used here will appear in futureSCO products.andP;  They are well implemented and could form the basis for anyrespectable full-screen application.andM;With all this attention given to the visuals, however, something got lost inthe upper layers.andP;  Too many of the options just didn't work right, and longforms weren't filled in with sensible defaults.andP;  A great deal was missing,too, leaving administrators better off learning the necessary commands fordoing their jobs &quot;by hand&quot;.andP;  SCO also loses to ISC in extensibility.andP;  Whilethere is nothing about sysadmsh that suggests it cannot be extended, nooptions were added to its menu structure when the layered products wereloaded.andP;  They are maintained by individual shell scripts scattered throughoutthe system.andM;Cross-Environment CompatibilityandM;Before its release, System V Release 3.2 was trumpeted as beingbinary-compatible with a broad range of software.andP;  Both Xenix (80286 and80386) and UNIX (80386 only) binaries can be run unmodified on either 386/ixor SCO System V/386.andP;  Further, with VP/ix installed, DOS binaries can be runfrom the UNIX command line with full functionality.andP;  I successfullytransferred even complex programs from one system to the other withoutproblems.andP;  Binary compatibility is all it's cracked up to be, with asignificant exception: installation.andM;SCO provides one particular piece of the ATandamp;T System V sysadm utility inorder to allow installation of System V programs under SCO's operatingsystem.andP;  It didn't work at all when I tried it, however.andP;  Likewise, ISC'scustom utility, used for installing SCO Xenix or UNIX applications under386/ix, worked, but lacked the crucial brand program.andP;  This program deciphersand serializes selected executables in an SCO distribution.andP;  Without it, mostapplications will just display &quot;invalid serial number&quot; and quit.andM;Disk I/O EnhancementsandM;The simple design of the System V filesystem can be graphed on a 3 x 5notecard.andP;  Its simplicity makes it easily maintainable and repairable but, asmany have noted, it's not the fastest thing to spin on a spindle.andP;  Bothvendors have chosen to take a chance and implement a variant filesystemscheme in order to improve performance.andM;ISC's method is unexpected, utilizing as it does the standard System V 1 Kfilesystem (named for its block size) as a base.andP;  Because of this, anycompatible filesystem can be mounted and will benefit from ISC's performanceenhancements.andP;  These enhancements occur at mount time, when the OS caches thefilesystem's free block list (and who knows what else).andP;  On dismount, thecached data is written back to the drive in a steady stream.andP;  Thisdrastically extends the time it takes to mount or dismount a filesystem (90seconds on a 300 MB drive), but the I/O improvement during normal operationis dramatic too.andP;  ISC claims a 300 percent performance gain, and it's easy tobelieve this to be true.andP;  The caching is all part of an aptly-namedenhancement package called the High Performance Disk Drivers.andP;  I likedvirtually everything about HPDD, from its support for up to 4 SCSI harddrives and multiple controllers, to its clean, simple configurationinterface.andP;  I must tip my hat to ISC for finding a way to improve I/Operformance without sacrificing System V compatibility.andM;SCO System V designers chose a more common approach: they modified thefilesystem to make it faster.andP;  SCO uses AFS, the Acer Fastfile System, andalso built performance enhancements into its own disk drivers.andP;  The AFSfilesystem mounts and dismounts almost instantly but, through optimizedplacement of data, AFS achieves results nearly as good as ISC's.andP;  While thenumbers looked fairly solid, the SCSI device driver was quite new, and it wasobvious that it needed more work.andP;  A specific model SCSI drive, the CDC WrenIll, could not be used, and this version included support only for a singledrive.andP;  These issues are known to SCO and it is working to correct thembefore the product is released.andM;Of course, there had to be benchmarks.andP;  Figure 1 shows the test results froma disk benchmark.andP;  The system-call test uses a mix of common calls toexercise the link between kernel and user space.andP;  Each of the disk testsfocus on various common I/O operations, testing the driver's speed in puttingdata out to the disk, as well as the efficiency of the caching mechanismsused.andP;  The small-buffer test creates a file by writing 100,000 64-byterecords, reading them back sequentially and at the same record size.andP;  Thelarge-buffer test builds a file from 6144 records, each 5 KB in size, readingthem is as with the previous test.andP;  The filesystem tests create, read, anddestroy 1000 files, each 4 KB in size, in a new subdirectory.andM;The C Development SystemandM;UNIX is known to provide one of the most comfortable, versatile developmentenvironments around, and ISC and SCO are not exceptions to this rule.andP;  Thebase tool sets are identical and familiar.andP;  The C compiler is augmented withgarden-variety UNIX toys including lex, yacc, sdb, and awk.andP;  Several otherSystem V specialties, like cscope, are inlcuded as well.andM;The compilers produce 80386 native code, and facilities for creating sharedlibraries and device drivers are provided.andP;  Beyond this, SCO's compilerdiverges significantly from ISC's.andP;  ISC provides only ATandamp;T's C compiler.andP;  SCOalso offers, as standard, the Microsoft C compiler that is shipped withXenix.andM;The Microsoft compiler is a gadget-lover's dream.andP;  Its list of optionsoccupies eight pages in the reference manual.andP;  Mostly, the abundance ofoptions boosts the compiler's capacity as a cross-development tool.andP;  C sourcecode goes in one end and, depending on the options invoked, out comes UNIX,Xenix (8088, 80286, or 80386), MS-DOS, or OS/2 binaries.andM;There was no significant difference in performance or code size, but someUNIX programs would not link properly.andP;  The Microsoft compiler apparentlyproduces System V-format object files (COFF) by converting fromXenix/Microsoft proprietary format (OBJ).andP;  This conversion would sometimesfail, requiring the ATandamp;T compiler to be used instead.andM;The X Window SystemandM;X Windows on the 80386 is fairly new.andP;  SCO provided us with a product forreview that consists of pieces of its future X11-based Open Desktop product,and ISC's X11 shipped to customers only a week before this review wasfinished.andM;ISC's product had enough available (including documentation and utilities) tothoroughly evaluate it.andP;  As complex as it is, even someone who's never seenX11 can get it installed and running with a minimum of difficulty.andP;  Thedevelopment and runtime systems are separate, but installing only the runtimeis enough to give you a &quot;feel&quot; for the X Window System.andP;  Several standardclients, or top-level applications, are provided.andP;  Some, like xterm, theterminal emulator, are essential.andP;  Others, such as xclock and xbiff (a homelylittle mailbox whose flag pops up when you have new mail) are fluff but arehandy and help round out the desktop appearance.andM;ISC's engineering staff worked its own X11 port from the MIT publicdomainsource tapes, while SCO purchased Xsight from Locus Computing (Inglewood,CA).andP;  Both vendors have stated intentions to support OSF/Motif, and those whorequest it can obtain the latest &quot;snapshot&quot; from either.andP;  Of the components,only the Motif Window Manager (mwm) was finished enough to review.andP;  It is notso much an application as it is an application environment.andP;  Window managersin general belong to a special class of client programs that create a userinterface for X11, apart from the interface provided by indidualapplications.andP;  Without them, windows cannot be easily moved, resized, orrestacked.andP;  The Motif window manager highlights the capabilities ofHewlett-Packard's three-dimensional look, which has been adopted by the OSF(with changes to make it more compatible with DEC's programming interface).andM;Configuring ISC's X11 implementation is straightforward and is handledthrough a set of sysadm menu options.andP;  The range of supported display typesis boggling, and ISC engineers are working to implement more.andP;  Most of theseare VGA and enhanced VGA cards, with support for resolutions of up to 1024 x768.andP;  a maximum of 16 colors are supported on EGA and VGA devices, even ifthe card can support more.andP;  Other boards fall into the &quot;intelligent&quot; categoryand come from well-known vendors like Matrox and Pixelworks.andP;  These haveonboard processors, support very high resolutions, and cost a great dealmore.andP;  Most users just stepping into the X Window System will find VGA andits enhanced cousins adequate.andP;  Someone with a workstation background willlikely be annoyed by the relative slowness of VGA hardware, and may wish toconsider one of the smarter, more powerful, more costly boards.andM;SCO has taken a single-server approach, with all of the supported boardsencoded into one server.andP;  Of the high-resolution varieties, only EGA and VGAare represented, and without any of the enhanced modes.andP;  This makes SCO X11easier to run (less (preconfiguration is needed), but less versatile.andP;  If SCOstays with this approach, every time support is added for some new displaydevice the server's size will grow.andP;  One interesting feature encoded in SCO'sVGA X11 server is the capacity to allocate a larger &quot;virtual&quot; display thancan be accommodated by the physical display.andP;  On capable VGA cards, an 800 x600 virtual area is mapped onto the 640 x 480 physical screen, with real-timepanning occurring when the mouse is pushed past any edge of the screen.andP;  Thisis not very useful for text windows, but applications that place buttons andother controls along a window edge do benefit from it.andM;Assuming that many X11 users will not be using the product on a network, SCOoffers two separate client directories (and development libraries).andP;  One isfor standalone systems, and the other is for networks.andP;  The standaloneclients use shared memory to pass their requests to the server.andP;  This isfast, and most clients can open server connections and have their windowsdisplayed in a second or so.andP;  Users who know they'll never use a network candelete or archive the networkable clients and development libraries to savespace.andP;  Also, the standalone clients can be used, even on a network, whencommunicating with the host display, eliminating the overhead of &quot;talking toyourself&quot; through a network connection.andM;ISC's X11 requires that clients have networking support built in.andP;  The socketlibrary, libinet.a, must be bound in with every client because the X11 codecalls it to find out if a network exists.andP;  If TCP/IP is not installed, theserver and clients switch over to shared memory.andP;  If a network is running,even if no other machines are active, a TCP/IP connection between clients andthe server is used instead.andP;  This doesn't have any direct effect, except thatrunning TCP/IP incurs a barely noticeable overhead.andM;The SCO product was so preliminary that running benchmarks against it wouldhave been futile.andP;  Generally, though, it was faster than its ISCcounterpart--which is surprising, because all of the SCO X11 binaries(clients and servers alike) were Xenix/386 executables.andP;  Apparently, thesehave some edge in floating-point emulation performance.andP;  Running without mathco-processors, my SCO system showed vastly superior speed in wide-line andarc (circle) drawing, operations which rely heavily on floating-pointarithmetic.andP;  With co-processors installed, both X11 implementations wereroughly equivalent in performance, except that circles were still drawn veryslowly by 386/ix X11.andP;  Once SCO builds the final release version of its X11product, it, too, will presumably link with the regular System V/386floating-point emulator.andP;  When this is done, performance for both ISC's andSCO's offerings will be similarly sluggish on systems without co-processors.andO;I would recommend that all users of x11 on the 80386 plan to invest in a mathco-processor.andM;ISC supplies most of the content of the MIT tape, including a variety offun-to-run (and sometimes useful) user-contributed programs and fonts.andP;  SCO'sbeta release focused instead on providing well-rounded Motif support,including source-code examples for using Digital's User Interface Language.andO;It's too early to tell which components will actually make it into the OSF'srelease version of Motif, but both ISC and SCO have big plans for it once itcomes out.andM;SecurityandM;In addition to its reputation for unfriendliness, UNIX has also managed toget tagged as one of the most &quot;insecure&quot; operating systems around.andP;  This maynot seem true to the casual user, but the largest hole in UNIX security isthat once someone gains superuser privileges, even temporarily, he or she canarrange to keep them even after they have (apparently) been revoked.andM;ATandamp;T's System V Release 3.2 added very little in the way of tighter security.andO;The most dramatic development involved the relocation of encrypted passworddata from the world-readable /etc/ passwd to the more heavily protected /etc/shadow.andP;  Password aging exists, too, and user passwords are forced (by thepasswd program) to contain at least one special character.andP;  Users arenotified of the last time their account was used.andP;  To limit unwelcometampering from the outside, uucp optionally refuses connections to unknownhosts.andP;  ISC's 386/ix simply inherits these traits from ATandamp;T's Release 3.2,but SCO has decided they don't go far enough.andM;SCO's SecureWare package offers kernel modifications that turn SCO System Vinto what SCO claims the US government would classify as a Class C2 securesystem.andP;  Mostly, this involves the ability to selectively authorize or deny auser access to specific resources (programs, data, or devices).andP;  Each user,in addition to being stamped with user and group identification codes, has asecurity profile that determines the level of access he or she has to systemresources.andP;  Extensive audit facilities can be invoked, tracking all of auser's security-important activities down to the system-call level.andP;  Only thekernel and &quot;trusted applications&quot; have access to the audit system and itsfiles, so the opportunity for tampering is reduced.andP;  The first line ofdefense remains standard UNIX file protections, but with the securityfeatures enabled it should be very difficult for a user lacking specificauthorization to do much harm and, if someone does find a way through, theaudit trail should help identify the perpetrator and plug the hole.andM;To some, this seems all for naught, given that someone armed with thesuperuser password can still break through and do virtually anything.andP;  Manysystems have several people responsible for administration, and each onetypically requires the superuser password to gain access to programs anddevices that are (rightfully) protected from general users.andP;  What makes SCO'sSecureWare package work is that, once implemented, these global privilegescan be replaced with more restrictive, specific privileges, leaving onlyenough room for the particularly defined work to be done.andM;SCO UNIX System V/386 is shipped with security features disabled.andP;  Onceswitched on, the myriad security options are controlled through the sysadmshprogram.andP;  This portion of the interface is well devised, and users who arenot intimately familiar with secure-systems concepts should have no troublestringing the rope that separates users from sensitive resources.andM;I was only able to view those SecureWare components that help tighten up astandalone system.andP;  With care, dial-up login lines can be covered, but UUCP,TCP/IP, NFS, and X11 have the potential to open up holes through whichsensitive information can be compromised or damaged.andP;  It may be that onlythose systems which don't have outside-world connections can be consideredsecure.andM;Network Mail FacilitiesandM;Network and uucp mail are implemented differently in the ISC and SCOoperating systems.andP;  Under ATandamp;T's System V, shipping mail across networkconnections, unless they support the uucp protocols, is either not done or,at least, not gracefully done.andP;  SCO takes a stab at solving this problem byproviding a network mailer called MMDF, the Multi-channel MemorandumDistribution Facility.andP;  This set of programs works from an array ofconfiguration files.andP;  After hours of following along in the manual andplaying with MMDF, I was unable to get it to deliver any mail to my networkhost.andM;ISC, however, has chosen a more popular approach by porting in the familiarBerkeley sendmail program enhanced with smail, a utility that helps theSystem V mail and mailx programs send and receive network mail.andP;  Bothsendmail and MMDF would be difficult to configure from scratch, but thesingle configuration file required for sendmail is included, and it has theability to handle most mail-delivery requirements with only simplemodifications.andM;I've been working with multiuser PC operating systems since the first onesbecame available, and I have always hoped that, one day, a real UNIX wouldrescue me from the pit of unportability and mediocrity.andP;  I've now sampled twosuch packages, and I can honestly say I've never been more pleased with thestate of PC operating systems.andP;  While doing the research for this review, Iwas able to shape a comfortable environment for myself (with the exception ofelectronic mail) using both packages.andP;  They didn't crash unless I didsomething stupid in juggling devices between systems.andP;  Response time wasexcellent in most cases, and stayed quite respectable even under a heavyload.andM;ISC is a quicker, leaner company, and has become tremendously aggressivesince its acquisition by Kodak.andP;  It has managed to be first in many importantways, and is largely responsible for creating the market into which all thesenew players are crowding.andP;  I expect this trend will continue, and that ISCwill always be a few technological steps ahead of SCO and the others.andP;  Thisis meaningful for software developers looking to get a jump on theircompetitors and design leading-edge products.andP;  Volume purchasers and systemsintegrators will enjoy ISC's quickness as well -- it will give them room tohave fully configured systems put together when most other UNIX vendors arestill in the beta-test stage.andP;  Despite this evident drive to be first, thequality of ISC's software has not suffered.andM;ISC's documentation, as discussed earlier, is quite a different story.andP;  Withsoftware offerings this complex, manuals should not be optional.andP;  Making themso does little to dispel the popular notion that UNIX is unwieldy.andP;  Thehaphazard construction of ISC's manuals contrasts sharply with the overalltightness and attention to detail found in the rest of the product.andO;Documentations gives users their first impression of every operating system,and as ISC gains momentum the company may put the proper degree of importanceon it.andM;SCO has introduced thousands of users to UNIX, and it adopts a calmer, moreconsidered approach to new products.andP;  Every SCO customer is familiar withmissed release deadlines, and even inside the company there are people whojoke about it: &quot;They say it will be out in May, but from eperience I'dinterpret that to mean July.&quot;andP;  This makes it tough on those who need to maketime-critical decisions.andP;  On the other hand, the extra time-to-market givesSCO a chance to build in more added value, and those who tough it out willcontinue to find SCO's products more feature-laden than those of itscompetitors.andP;  This first foray into true UNIX finds SCO adding C2 security,Posix compliance (as much as has been defined, anyway), a menu-driven visualshell, and support for a broad range of tape and serial devices.andM;Retailers will have an easier time selling the sCO product because of itscompleteness and because it is better tuned for new UNIX users.andP;  While it isnot as easily extensible as ISC's 386/ix, applications-oriented users havelittle need for simple ways to modify the kernel.andP;  Much of SCO System V/386'sunique appeal derives from efforts to maintain compatibility with Xenix.andO;More BSD commands are included than in 386/ix, on-line manual pages arestandard-issue, and the compiler's ability to generate Xenix (also DOSandOS/2) binaries is a plus.andP;  DOS developers familiar with the Microsoft Ccompiler will feel right at home.andP;  Sometimes the drive to make things easyfor newcomers pushes SCO too far, though.andP;  The system administrator's shellis just too fancy, particularly since no alternate, simpler interface isoffered.andP;  I see sysadm as an integral, invaluable part of System V, and SCO'sdecision not to include it impedes portability.andM;Many users have been holding back for years now, fearing UNIX as someawesome, puzzling curiosity, but vowing to pick it up &quot;when the time comes&quot;.andO;Others figure that a small machine couldn't possibly deliver the stabilityand performance their big boxes do.andP;  These two high-quality, robustimplementations, however, show that the time has come.andP;  The intensecompetitiveness of this fledgling UNIX market will drive its players tocontinue to enhance and tune their products.andP;  There's no longer any need towait.andM;Tom Yager, this month's reviewer, is a UNIX software engineer and freelancetechnical writer.andP;  He maintains a UNIX test lab in Westboro, MA.andP;  His e-mailaddress is tyager % maxx@m2c.m2c.org.andM;Richard Morin, column editor, operates Canta Forda Computer Laboratory, aconsulting firm in San Bruno, CA.andP;
