(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker's wafflingtestimony combined with a skillful job by prosecutors to convictthe TV evangelist of defrauding thousands of loyal supporters whosent him $158 million, court observers say.   ``What the prosecutors did was masterful,'' said Charlottelawyer Mike Scofield, a former federal prosecutor who watched thetrial closely. ``They simplified and clarified what could have beena very difficult and confusing case.''   Ken Andreson, another former assistant U.S. attorney, saidprosecutors Deborah Smith and Jerry Miller did their homeworkbefore bringing Bakker to federal court.   ``They were very adept at using Bakker's own statements to theirmaximum advantage,'' he said. ``They cast him in the light theywanted the jurors to see him.''   Following a day and a half of deliberations, a jury Thursdayconvicted the former PTL leader of all 24 counts of mail fraud,wire fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors accused him of diverting$3.7 million of the $158 million sent in for PTL partnerships tohis own use.   Bakker faces maximum penalties of 120 years in prison and morethan $5 million in fines when he is sentenced Oct. 24.   The evangelist, who posted $250,000 bond and returned to hishome in Orlando, Fla., planned to address his followers at a churchservice there Sunday, Don Baldwin, acting general manager of Jimand Tammy Ministries, said Saturday.   More than 50 loyal Bakker supporters were among the 75 witnessescalled by defense attorneys Harold Bender and George T. Davis. Manyof the character witnesses acknowledged under cross-examinationthat no facts that came up in the trial could alter their view ofBakker.   Defense witness Ken Coppersmith reflected their bitterness atthe verdict: ``There's freedom and justice for all _ except JimBakker.''   Other supporters accused U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, aconservative Reagan appointee, of bias against their hero. Afterthe verdict, Potter had said he hesitated to release Bakker on bailbecause he believed some Bakker followers had a ``Jim Jonesmentality.''   Scofield and Andreson praised Potter and the prosecutors formaintaining control of a trial that often resembled a soap opera.It featured a hurricane-caused blackout, Bakker praying for afainting witness and suffering an emotional breakdown, and histearful wife, Tammy Faye, reacting to the verdict by singing gospel.   Juror Barbara Dalley said Bakker hurt himself when he took thestand as the last defense witness.   ``He contradicted so many other witnesses' testimony,'' shesaid. ``None of us believed he was telling the truth.''   Prosecutors portrayed Bakker as a con man who lied on TV to getpeople to send him money. During the nearly six-week trial, theycalled more than 100 witnesses but never strayed far from theirfocus on the fraud case's victims, PTL's faithful ``lifetimepartners.''   From 1984-87, nearly 153,000 people became partners, typicallyby sending in $1,000 in return for a promise of three free nightsof lodging each year for life at PTL's 2,400-acre Christian retreatin nearby Fort Mill, S.C.   With the help of Ms. Smith, a Justice Department fraudspecialist, and Miller, an assistant U.S. attorney, the jurors wereable to associate the specific wire and mail fraud charges withindividual victims.   One count focused on the plight of retired coal miner LamarKerstetter, who suffers from black lung disease.   Asked what he expected in return for his $1,000, the resident ofShamokin, Pa., responded: ``My four days and three nights.''   ``There was constant juxtaposition of the victims with witnesseswho testified about the extravagances of Jim Bakker,'' Scofieldsaid.   Andreson said the government was able to dispel the public imageBakker built through years of TV appearances heralding familyvalues on his Christian talk show.   ``They were able to create an identity in the courtroom Ibelieve not many people were aware of before the trial,'' he said.   ``It's hard to like someone who spent $100 on cinnamon buns justto toss them out,'' he said.   Bakker's former bodyguard testified that he once purchased $100worth of cinnamon buns because the Bakkers liked the aroma. Afterseveral days, the uneaten buns were thrown out.   Bakker's former accountant testified that the Bakkers onceearned only about $600 in interest on their bank accounts in a yearin which Bakker earned about $700,000 because the money came andwent so quickly.   The jury was shown eight hours of videotapes in which Bakker wasseen over and over hawking partnerships as he sold more than twicethe number that could be accommodated at existing PTL facilities.Only one of the hotels that he showed viewers plans for wasfinished before Bakker resigned March 19, 1987, after revelation ofhis sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn.</TEXT></DOC>
