<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-1073 </DOCNO><TEXT>The reaction /sup 114/Cd(t,p) /sup 116/Cd has been studied with a 15 MeVtriton beam, 21 energy levels in /sup 116/Cd have been identified upto approximately 3.5 MeV excitation, four of which were previously unreported.Angular distributions were measured and compared with distorted-waveBorn-approximation calculations in order to make L transfer (and henceJ {pi}) assignments. The assignments to 13 of the states are reportedfor the first time.</TEXT></DOC>
