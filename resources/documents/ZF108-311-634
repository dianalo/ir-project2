 This kind of analysis is important for anyentrepreneur, but it is almost essential if you want to attract investors toyour new business.andM;A business plan grows out of a number of underlying assumptions you makeabout your anticipated revenues, operating costs, and capital requirements.andO;Figure 1 on page 40 shows the input categories that are the basis for severalfinancial statements, which include a balance sheet (figure 2), a cash flowsummary (figure 3), and an income statement (figure 4).andP;  Together thesestatements measure a venture's financial viability and potential.andM;In the next section we'll take a look at how the model was used to analyzethe hypothetical manufacturing business depicted in the figures.andP;  It's notnecessary to build the model to understand this part of the discussion.andP;  In alater section we'll examine the model's internal relationships in greaterdetail and tell you what changes you can make to analyze a business thatyou're starting from scratch.andM;A HYPOTHETICAL CASE STUDYandM;Consider the case of a small manufacturer of specialty clothing, ArmadilloTogs, that is up for sale.andP;  Carol Armadillo, the owner of the company, hasbeen operating her business successfully for years but now she finds that shemust raise cash to pay for her son's graduate-school education.andP;  Her askingprice for the company is $250,000.andM;You think you may be interested in this deal, so you construct the followingworksheet to give yourself an idea of how profitable the investment will be,given certain assumptions.andM;The amounts in column J represent the capital you expect to invest in andwithdraw from the business.andP;  The $250,000 purchase price is a capital outflowand is entered as a negative number in cell J3.andP;  You also expect tocontribute $50,000 in working capital in the first year to expand thebusiness.andP;  This is represented as a capital outflow in cell J4.andP;  You plan tomake no capital contributions or withdrawals in the second year.andP;  In thethird, fourth, and fifth years, you plan to withdraw $100,000 in profit, andat the end of the fifth year, you plan to sell the business for $400,000.andM;In cell M3 you enter the formula @IRR(0.1,J3..J8), where the first parameterrepresents a guess of a 10% rate of return on the investment.andP;  The formulaindicates that if the investment in the clothing company works out asplanned, your rate of return will be 21.43%.andP;  You think this is worthwhilereturn.andP;  so you proceed.andM;To analyze the potential of this deal, you will use the template shown infigures 1 through 4.andP;  The template is set up to analyze financial performanceover five periods.andP;  You decide to let each period equal one year.andP;  For smaller business, you might use a shorter period of time to monitor cash flowmore accurately.andP;  If this were a business that had a unique businesscycle--say, one lasting 30 weeks--you would probably want to let one periodequal that amout of time.andM;Because Carol has done a good job of bookkeeping, you have all theinformation you need for the model's input cells (shaded in the figures).andO;The model begins with Period 0, which we use to represent the company'sperformance during the last year.andM;You begin by estimating potential sales revenue.andP;  The model assumes that pastperformance is an indicator of the future.andP;  Carol's books show that salesrevenue for the last year was $650,000.andP;  After checking prior periods to makesure this performance wasn't a fluke, you enter $650,000 in cell B8.andM;Next you must project sales revenue for the five periods covered by themodel.andP;  One reason you are attracted to this deal is that you think you canmake the company more profitable by aggressively marketing its line ofclothing.andP;  Your ambitious plan calls for a 20% period-to-period salesincrease over the next five periods.andP;  You enter 20% in cell B9, which themodel uses to calculate the revenue projections in range C8..G8.andM;ESTIMATE EXPENSESandM;For each period, the cost of purchases equals starting inventory pluspurchases of goods less ending inventory.andP;  Carol's records indicate that herpurchases of goods totaled $230,000 over the past year.andP;  A just-completedphysical inventory yielded at total of $23,000 worth of goods.andP;  You enterthese amounts in cells B14 and B15, respectively.andP;  Inventory one year ago, atthe beginning of Period 0, was $24,000, which you enter in cell B13.andP;  In cellB16 the model adds up the cost of purchases for Period 0.andP;  It uses this sameformula to add the cost of purchases for the next five periods (rangeC16..G16).andM;Cost of goods sold also includes the labor, overhead, and depreciation costsassociated with the factory.andP;  These costs are entered in range B17..B18.andO;Cell B19 sums cells B16..B18 to arrive at an overall figure for cost of goodssold for Period 0.andP;  In cell B20 the model calculates the ratio between costof goods sold and sales revenue for Period 0, a key indicator for manybusinesses.andM;This example divides operating expenses into three traditional categories:general and administrative, research and development, and sales and marketin.andO;To adapt the model to reflect a different breakdown of these expenses, changethe labels in range A24..A32 and insert or delete rows, or simply insert ordelete rows.andM;General and administrative (Gandamp;A) expenses include salaries, payroll taxes,telephone costs, utilities, postage, and building rent, to name some largeritems.andP;  These expenses are often broken out in detail in a separate schedule.andM;Carol counts her own salary as part of this category.andP;  If her business wereset up as a proprietorship rather than a corporation, the $50,000 salary shepaid herself for the year would be considered a &quot;cash draw&quot; and would becounted as capital distributed in cell B56.andP;  The same would be true for youif you intended to run the business as a proprietorship and to draw a salary.andM;The next operating-expense category is Research andamp; Development.andP;  Carol has oneemployee whom you include in this category because he develops new fashionlines.andP;  His salary and expenses total $25,000, which you enter in cell B26.andO;When you press the CALC key, the model will calculate the Period 0 ratio ofRandamp;D expense to sales revenue in cell B27 and use this ratio to estimate Randamp;Dexpenses for Periods 1 through 5.andP;  In a similar manner, the model will usethe Period 0 sales-and-marketing expense you enter in cell B28 in order toproject your sales-and-marketing expenses for Periods 1 through 5.andM;It is standard accounting practice to include depreciation as part ofoperating expense, as well.andP;  The $116,000 Gandamp;A expense for Period 0 (cell B24)includes $106,000 in cash expenditures plus the $10,000 worth of depreciationyou see in cell B30.andP;  The $10,000 worth of depreciation is an accountingconvention that represents the decline in value of the business's Gandamp;Aequipment as it grows older.andP;  For accounting and tax purposes, you areallowed to take depreciation on an item even if its value is steady orrising.andM;You can see in rows 30 through 32 that each category of operating expenses isassigned its own depreciation.andP;  However, if you purchased a new computer thatwas to be used partly for administrative work and partly for designingmarketing brochures, it would be appropriate to split the computer'sdepreciation between the Gandamp;A and Sandamp;M depreciation categories.andM;The plant and each item of equipment have individual depreciation schedules.andO;You would use a separate worksheet to calculate depreciation amounts for eachitem in each period.andP;  Then you would add them together in their propercategories and use the totals in this model.andP;  Be aware that the depreciationfigures used in this example are made-up numbers and do not represent thiskind of careful analysis.andM;ASSET ANDandM;FINANCING INPUTSandM;You enter your planned investments in plant, property, equipment, and othernoncurrent assets in the Capital Expenditures Inputs section of the model.andO;Since your initial analysis of the company will assume no new capitalinvestments during the five years, you enter zeros in all the cells of thissection.andM;In the Current Assets Inputs section of the model, you estimate how yourcurrent assets will perform.andP;  The major current asset that this sectiondoesn't track is cash, which is treated in greater detail in the cash flowschedule of figure 3.andP;  The accounts receivable figures shown in row 43 offigure 1 are ratios that are used to calculate wholenumber amounts.andP;  Theyrepresent the average amount of time it takes a customer to pay divided bythe time in the period.andP;  Carol tells you that the average time to pay is twomonths.andP;  Since there are twelve months in the period, you enter 2/12 in cellB43.andP;  You have no reason to believe that you'll be able to improve on thisrecord, so you copy cell B43 to range C43..G43.andM;In cell B44, the ending inventory you entered in cell B15 is divided by thetotal amount spent on goods in cell B14 to arrive at a ratio of .10.andP;  Thismeans that Carol's inventory of goods purchased turns over, on average, inabout one-tenth of a year.andP;  This ratio is enviable in many businesses, so youuse the Range Value(s) command to copy it to range C44..G44.andM;The vendor deposits in row 45 include the amounts you prepay to vendors aspart of placing an order or as security for doing business.andP;  You know that toget credit with a certain wholesaler, you will have to pay a two-yearsecurity deposit of $10,000 in Period 1, so you enter 10000 in cell C45.andO;Since you'll get the money back in Period 3, you enter -10000 in cell E45.andM;Rows 49 through 56 cover the business's financing inputs.andP;  The accountspayable ratios in row 49 are the inverse of the accounts receivables ratiosin row 43.andP;  You find that Carol pays her bills quickly--in an average of amonth's time.andP;  Since a month is one-twelfth of a year, you enter 1/12 in cellB49.andP;  You intend to stretch out your payments to an average of two months'time to delay cash outflows.andP;  To represent this, you enter 2/12 in cell C49and copy it to range D49..G49.andM;The customer deposits in row 50 are the flip side of vendor deposits.andP;  Inthis case they include deposits you receive from customers for orders.andP;  Caroltells you that you can count on keeping the nonrefundable $2,500 deposit ofat least one failed retailer per year, so you enter 2500 in cell B50 and copyit to C50..G50.andM;Carol has two kinds of debt outstanding: a revolving credit line and anamortizing loan.andP;  There's currently $35,000 outstanding on the credit line,so you enter 35000 in cell B51.andP;  You intend to draw another $5,000 to pay forexpenses in Period 1, then pay back the $40,000 outstanding in $10,000increments over the next four periods.andP;  You enter 5000 in cell C51 and -10000in range D51..G51.andM;The other debt is a 10-year, 12% loan of $150,000.andP;  Carol has paid exactlyhalf of the 120 monthly installments.andP;  On a separate worksheet, you figureout how much interest and principal will be repaid in each of the next fiveyears and enter these amounts in rows 52 and 53.andP;  If you aren't sure how todo this, see &quot;What You Owe: The Loan-Status Analyzer&quot; in the November issue,page 56.andM;In row 54, you enter your period cash interest rate.andP;  This is the amount youearn on your cash balances.andP;  The company's money market account has beenearning 8% annual interest during Period 0, so you enter .08 in cell B54.andO;For lack of a better guess, you assume this interest rate will remain at 8%throughout the five periods, so you copy cell B54 to range C54..G54.andM;In a similar fashion, you also need to enter in row 55 the period credit lineinterest rate, which calculates the interest on your credit line.andP;  Thecompany's credit line carries an annual interest rate of 12%, so you enter.12 in cell B55 and copy that cell to range C55.G55.andM;CAPITAL: HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?andM;The last inputs in figure 1 concern the flow of capital in and out of thebusiness.andP;  Since the model is using this cell to calculate an asset base atthe end of Period 0, you enter 0 in cell B56.andP;  Now, the hard part.andP;  Afteryou've bought the business, how much additional capital will you need to keepit solvent?andP;  This is a crucial question because entrepreneurs--especiallythose starting new businesses--sometimes find it hard to estimate thisamount.andP;  This can lead to cash flow crises early in the life of the businessand to business failures that could have been prevented.andM;You decide that you're willing to sink $50,000 worth of working capital intothe business in Period 1.andP;  Therefore, you enter 50000 in cell C56.andP;  You willmake no capital contributions or withdrawals in Period 2, so you enter 0 incell D56.andP;  In Periods 3 through 5 you intend to withdraw capital amounting to$100,000 per period, in accordance with the investment plan shown in thefigure on page 38.andP;  You enter -100000 in range E56..G56.andM;We'll soon be able to use the model to see if these expectations arereasonable.andP;  First, though, we must move to the input cells of the balancesheet, which are in the shaded areas of figure 2.andM;The current assets owned by the business are fairly easy to determine.andP;  Thereis $50,000 in the company's money market account, and you can verify $54,000worth of accounts receivable.andP;  You enter these amounts in cells B63 and B64,respectively.andM;Noncurrent assets, sometimes called fixed assets, include Carol'smanufacturing assembly line, which originally cost $250,000.andP;  Her warehouseand the land it is situated on are now worth $100,000.andP;  Other noncurrentassets include her fixtures and small equipment, which cost her a total of$75,000.andP;  These inputs go in range B71..B73.andP;  The building and the individualitems of equipment have been depreciating, each on its own schedule, duringthe time she has owned them.andP;  You use a separate worksheet to total thecumulative depreciation of all these items and find it comes to $155,000.andO;You enter -155000 in cell B75.andM;The company's liabilities and owner equity are grouped in the next section ofthe balance sheet.andP;  Carol verifies that there are currently $40,000 worth ofaccounts payable, so you enter that amount in cell B84.andP;  In row 86 you enterthe balance due on the fixed-rate loan at the end of each year.andP;  Theseamounts will come from the same worksheet you constructed to figure out theprincipal and interest on this debt, which you entered in rows 52 and 53.andM;Finally, you enter 0 in cell B92 and press the CALC key.andP;  Does thisinvestment meet your goals?andM;The bottom line of the income statement looks promising.andP;  You see in row 148that under the assumptions you have made in Figure 1, the business will posta growing profit.andM;Now look at the bottom line of figure 3, which shows ending cash.andP;  Cash flowwon't be a problem in the first two years, thanks to the $50,000 in capitalyou contributed in Period 1, which shows up in cell C106.andP;  However, your planto withdraw $100,000 in profits in Periods 3, 4, and 5 will run the company'scash balance into the red during Period 4.andM;It's time to tinker with the model.andP;  We'll see how changes in assumptions andexpectations can affect the bottom lines of the balance sheet, the cash flowstatement, and the income statement.andP;  If you wish to follow the discussion inthe next section, build the model now, using the instructions in the box onpages 44 and 45.andM;WORK WITH THE MODELandM;After researching the clothing industry, you believe that you can increaseyour workers' productivity by investing $50,000 in state-of-the-art sewingequipment.andP;  Workers who use such equipment produce more goods in less time,which holds down the cost of wages.andP;  Using this strategy, on a separateworksheet you calculate that you can reduce your factory labor and overheadto 20% of revenues.andM;To simulate this scenario, enter 50000 in cell C38.andP;  Overwrite the formula incell C17 with the formula .2*C8 and copy it to range D17..G17.andP;  Assume thatyou figured out the depreciation for this equipment on your depreciationschedule and that it raised the factory depreciation total to $25,000 foreach of the five years.andP;  Enter 25000 in cell C18 and copy it to rangeD18..G18.andP;  Then press CALC.andM;Now examine the ending cash balances for Periods 1 through 5 in row 125.andP;  Atthe end of Period 5, the company will have a cash balance of more than$108,000 if the new scenario is valid.andP;  In addition, the balance sheet willbe greatly improved.andP;  Your owner equity at the end of the fifth year (cellG95) will stand at $422,306, a marked improvement over the original scenario.andM;The importance of revenue and cost projections becomes evident if you test ascenario that isn't so optimistic.andP;  Assume the sales-growth rate is 10%rather than 20%.andP;  Enter .1 in cell B9 and press CALC.andP;  The business wouldstill be making a profit on operations (row 148).andP;  But ending cash for Period5 (cell G125) is dangerously low due to the heavy capital withdrawals inPeriods 3, 4, and 5.andP;  Thus, 10% growth, which many companies would considerhealthy, might prove disastrous in the context of your plan.andM;It is also important to consider capital-expenditures inputs.andP;  Enter .2 incell B9 and press CALC to return to the previous scenario for sales growth.andO;To sustain this 20% annual growth rate over the five-year period, it's likelythat you'll need more than a single capital outlay for new equipment.andP;  Youwould likely need to expand your plant and perhaps have to extend the size ofyour property to do it.andP;  The balance sheet shows that although total assetsduring the five-year period (row 79) are registering an increase, most of theincrease is in the form of current assets.andP;  Your noncurrent assets (row 77)show a precipitous decline.andM;Experimenting with your revenue, cost, capital, and other inputs to see howthey affect the bottom lines of the three financial statements.andP;  Be awarethat you don't have to follow the constant growth patterns set forth in thisexample.andP;  There's nothing wrong with writing over the formulas in rows 8, 14,17, 24, 26, and 28 with values in this manner.andP;  The formulas in these rangesare designed to be guides--mainly to keep you from entering impossible valuesjust to make the bottom-line numbers &quot;work&quot;.andP;  But if you have a logicalreason for substituting a value, by all means do so.andP;  For example, youshouldn't let the model estimate a 20% growth rate for all five periods ifyou really expect a lower rate in earlier periods.andM;DEPRECIATION: AandM;STICKY QUESTIONandM;The foregoing discussion was intended to give you a feel for the model--howto make inputs and what to look for in the results.andP;  The relationships withinthe model are tricky, but the formulas themselves aren't complex.andP;  With alittle time and effort, you'll be able to trace the flow of the template andsee how changing certain inputs affects the various accounting statements.andP;  Agood accounting textbook will help explain the relationships between thedifferent categories if you're still perplexed.andM;One category that can confuse almost anyone, though, is depreciation.andP;  We'vementioned it above, but since it's such a sticky question, we'll discuss itsrelationship to the different parts of the model.andP;  Enter 0 in cell C38 and20000 in range C18..G18.andP;  Then enter the formula ($B17/$B8)*C8 in cell C17,copy it to range D17..G17, and press CALC to make your spreadsheet match thefigures again for the following discussion.andM;The depreciation amounts you enter in figure 1 affect each of the accountingstatements in figures 2 through 4.andP;  Look first at row 75 of the balance sheetin figure 2.andP;  Row 75 tracks cumulative depreciation.andP;  Previously accumulateddepreciaton is added to the depreciation of each new period.andP;  This is why youmust identify depreciation as a subcategory of expenses for cost of goodssold and operating expenses for each period in rows 18, 30, 31, and 32.andM;If you look at the income statement in figure 4, you see that the expensesfor cost of goods sold (row 132) and operating expenses (rows 137 through139) come directly from the corresponding figures (range C19..G28) in figure1.andP;  These amounts include depreciation, since depreciation is a cost of doingbusiness.andP;  The bottomline result for Period1, pre-tax income, is a $6,399profit (cell C148).andM;The $6,399 profit is used in calculating your ending cash balance for Period1 in cell C107 of figure 3.andP;  To arrive at this profit amount, the incomestatement subtracted $483,400 for cost of goods sold and $279,200 foroperating expenses.andP;  However, $40,000 in depreciation was included in theseamounts, from rows 18, 30, 31, and 32.andP;  Actual cash outlays were only$463,400 and $259,200, respectively.andP;  So you must add back the $40,000depreciation amount to get an accurate cash balance.andP;  The model does this incell C108.andM;STARTUPS AND OTHER CHANGESandM;If you're starting a new business, this model makes it easier to get up andrunning.andP;  Simply enter 0 in all the input cells for Period 0 (the shadedcells in column B) in figures 1 and 2.andP;  But you must be careful.andP;  The Period0 inputs from an existing business provide a helpful track record that allowsyou to make reasonable assumptions about future periods.andP;  A business plan fora new venture, therefore, requires careful research.andM;Three sources available at most public libraries provide a number of keybusiness ratios for an array of industries: Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Industry Normsand Key Business Ratios, Robert Morse Associates' Annual Statement Studies,and the Quarterly Financial Report, published by the U.S.andP;  Department ofCommerce Bureau of Census.andM;The model uses Period 0 inputs to project sales revenue and operatingexpenses, so you'll have to make some adjustments if you enter 0 for all ofyour Period 0 inputs.andP;  You can enter revenue and expense estimates for allfive periods.andP;  Or you can enter estimates only for Period 1 (in rangeC8..C28), leave the formulas for the remaining four periods intact, and letthe model do the forecasting.andP;  If you choose the latter approach, you'll haveto change the formulas for the following cells:andM;Cell  Formula B20  +C19/C8 B25  (C24-C30)/C$8 B27  (C26-C31)/C$8 B29 (C28-C32)/C$8 D14  ($C14/$C8)*D8 D17  ($C17/$C8)*D8andM;Copy the last two formulas to ranges E14..G14 and E17..G17, respectively.andM;The adjusted formulas use Period 1 inputs rather than Period 0 inputs as abaseline for projecting performance in Periods 2 through 5.andP;  You'll also needto erase the formula in cell B44 to prevent it from displaying ERR in theworksheet.andM;If you want to use this model for a service business, set your cost of goodssold to zero by entering 0 in range B13..B15.andP;  This range tracks the tangiblematerials used in producing a company's product, so it's irrelevant if theonly input is your time.andP;  You would also enter zeros in range B17..G18.andP;  Youroverhead expenses will still be covered in the Operating Expenses part of themodel.andP;  If you're in a nonmanufacturing business, such as retailing, you'llcontinue to use the inventory inputs in range B13.B15, but you can enterzeros for the factory inputs in range B17..G18.andM;If your business has noncash operating expenses similar to depreciation,enter these amounts in the depreciation categories in rows 30 through 32.andO;Such expenses might include the depletion expense associated with naturalresources or the amortization expense associated with intangible assets, suchas copyrights and patents.andM;To extend the model so that it covers more forecasting periods, copy the lastcolumn of the model into as many additional columns as you need.andP;  Forexample, if you want to add five more periods to the model, copy rangeG1..G148 to range H1..L1.andP;  Forecasting periods don't have to equal a year;you can use any period you want as long as the periods are of equal length.andO;If fact, many startup businesses will construct their cash flow statements ona month-to-month basis to avoid unpleasant surprises.andM;If your business already has a business plan, it's unlikely that theaccounting statements presented in this article mirror the ones that youraccountant or accounting department prepared.andP;  For example, an existingincome statement might have different operating-expense categories than thethree in this model, and an existing balance sheet may group assetsdifferently.andP;  Existing statements, particularly income statements, are likelyto be supported by detailed schedules, such as the one we mentioned above fordepreciation.andP;  But these usually aren't too hard to understand.andP;  Once you'recomfortable with the accounting relationships embodied in this worksheet,you'll be able to adapt it easily to your situation.andM;Stephen L.
