(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of Episcopal bishops are seekingpenalties against a colleague for ordaining an avowed homosexual asa priest.   Bishop William Wantland of Eau Claire, Wis., said he and otherbishops plan to formally charge Newark Bishop John S. Spong withviolating the church's doctrinal teachings.   A minimum of 10 bishops is needed to support a formal chargeagainst a bishop. Wantland said he has ``far more'' than 10.   Last month, Spong ordained gay Deacon J. Robert Williams intothe priesthood at the All Saints Episcopal Church in Hoboken.   Church traditionalists said Spong violated a resolution of thechurch's General Convention that declares the ordination of apracticing homosexual to be inappropriate.   Spong has said he considers the 1979 resolution adopted by thechurch's governing body as advisory, not church doctrine.   He noted that the resolution had been opposed by 20 bishops,including Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning.   In response to the planned charges, Spong said he welcomed anyinquiry into his actions.</TEXT></DOC>
