In U.S. futures trading, the price of crude oil for Augustdelivery rose 31 cents to $18.67 a barrel. September crudesettled 50 cents higher at $19.85 a barrel.</LP><TEXT>   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, which hadset a new trading record of more than 50,000 contracts onlylast Friday, gasoil (heating oil) contracts surged whileNorth Sea Brent crude for August was up 41 cents a barrel to$17.84.   But U.S. fuel futures set the pace as expectations mountedthat the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries hascome to grips with its overproduction problem. On the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, the price of unleaded gasoline forAugust delivery surged 2.49 cents to settle at 64.44 cents agallon. The September contract was up the limit of two centsa gallon.   Among yesterday's OPEC developments: The Iranian oilminister arrived in Tripoli, where he visited the Libyan oilminister in his whirlwind campaign to gain support for anincrease of $2 a barrel to $20 in the OPEC reference price;the national oil company of Abu Dhabi, chief emirate of theUnited Arab Emirates, told its crude buyers that it intendsto reduce production some 400,000 barrels a day in August;and Kuwait reported a halt in spot sales, adding that it mayhave to buy crude from others for its refineries.   The Emirates and Kuwait, two chronic violators of OPECquotas, had pledged to reduce their production to 1.5 millionbarrels a day each under terms of last week's proposal byPersian Gulf oil exporters. The proposal, to be put beforeall 13 oil ministers at the OPEC meetings beginning in Genevanext week, is intended to lift petroleum prices by curbingrunaway production. It has improved prospects that all theoil ministers will swiftly agree to freeze the OPEC outputceiling near 22.1 million barrels a day.   As previously reported, leading Persian Gulf producers,including Kuwait, the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, are willingto hold their output down now in a trade-off for larger OPECshares later. And Kuwait confirmed yesterday that at lastweek's meeting of the five oil ministers in Jeddah, SaudiArabia, it was promised a higher production quota for thefourth quarter.   Rashid Salem Al-Ameeri, the new Kuwaiti oil minister, wasquoted by that country's news agency as saying, &quot;The Jeddahagreement affirmed the commitment to quotas and includedsupport for Kuwait to increase its oil production quota. Thiswould take effect during the fourth quarter of the currentyear, after oil prices are brought back under control and thecurrent glut on world oil markets has been absorbed.&quot;   So long as the OPEC news continues bullish, analysts saidother factors aren't having much effect on oil markets. TheAmerican Petroleum Institute's latest weekly report on U.S.oil inventories, which is due out today after futures tradingends, is likely to influence the markets. But analystsgenerally expect the institute to report another decline inU.S. crude oil inventories.   In other markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of several hog futurescontracts rose their maximum daily limit of 1.5 cents a poundamid a sudden tightening in the supply of hogs ready forslaughter. Livestock analysts weren't aware of any specificreason for the sudden shortage of mature hogs. But the hogmarket is so volatile this year that a blip in supplies cancause a wide price swing. In trading yesterday the price ofthe hog contract for July delivery settled at 62.77 cents apound, up 1.5 cents. In the spring, hog prices soared torecord highs because farmers had been reducing the size oftheir herds. In June, hog prices slipped as consumers beganresisting the high price of pork in the supermarket. So farthis month, hog prices have been swinging back and forth onmixed signals. Supermarket demand is still weak. Yetmeatpackers sometimes have to bid up prices in order to keeptheir plants supplied with enough hogs to keep operating. Hogprices may get another boost Friday. Some analysts expect theAgriculture Department to report that roughly twice thenormal rate of pork bellies was pulled out of frozen storagein June, a reflection of the tight supply of hogs ready forslaughter. Pork bellies are sliced into bacon. Also onFriday, the government is expected to report that the fewestyoung cattle in 15 years were placed onto feedlots in thesecond quarter. Among other things, the small number reflectsthe fact that an unusually wet spring improved the conditionof pastures. Through the winter, many ranchers were forced tomove their cattle to feedlots because dry weather had damagedtheir grazing lands. Feedlots rapidly fatten cattle forslaughter. Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst at ShearsonLehman Hutton, Chicago, said he expects the AgricultureDepartment's 13-state survey to find that 5.1 million cattlewere placed on feedlots in the second quarter, down 2% from ayear earlier.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices at first extended Friday'sdeclines, but they recovered in late trading to recoup mostof the day's losses. The September contract ended at $1.22 apound for a decline of 0.95 cent. Prices on Friday fellfollowing gains of almost 20 cents a pound over two weeks onproduction problems and concerns over supplies. As theselling continued yesterday, the September price dropped aslow as $1.2060. According to one analyst, &quot;Traders werelooking for a reason to sell and they found one,&quot;specifically news that workers at the Minero mine in Peru hadcalled off the strike scheduled to start yesterday. &quot;Thepotential strike in itself wasn't really very significant,but since traders wanted an excuse, the impact of itscancellation was magnified,&quot; he said. Late in the day, Reuterreported an earthquake had struck in Chile. It wasn't knownif it had any effect on copper production, but it triggeredbuying in futures that helped prices recover, analysts said.Chile is the world's biggest copper producer. An earthquakealso struck in the Philippines; the amount of damage wasn'timmediately known. The Philippines is a medium-sized producerof about 190,000 tons annually.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. August deliverygold was off $1.20 an ounce to $364.50. September silverdeclined 6.2 cents an ounce to $4.9030. October platinum fell$5 an ounce to $481.80. A stronger dollar contributed to thesetback in gold, which didn't follow through on strongadvances Thursday and Friday. Gold rose Thursday becauseFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated the centralbank was ready to ease monetary policy, and then on Fridaythe bank cut a key rate by about 1/4 percentage point toabout 8%. However, Sharon Zimian, vice president of Citibank,New York, observed that there was sufficient demand for goldcontracts to stem the decline. &quot;Gold behaved quite well,&quot; shesaid, despite the fact that &quot;the surge in the stock market toa record level surely must have drawn funds from the preciousmetals.&quot; Another element that might have minimized the dropwas that traders were awaiting the issuance today of reportson the trade deficit, industrial production and capacityutilization, she said. The setback in platinum was mostlyprofit-taking following Friday's sharp gains, said NinaLipton, research manager for Platinum Guild International, anindustry group.</TEXT></DOC>
