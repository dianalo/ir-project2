Bob Gregory, a spokesman for Rushdie's publisher, VikingPenguin, denounced the game as ``disgraceful and in bad taste.Here's a human being in hiding for fear of his life and they'remaking a game out of it. It's beyond belief.''   Rushdie has been in hiding for 11 months following the lateAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's appeal to Moslems to kill him forwriting ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel some Moslems findblasphemous.   Contacted by telephone at the lodge near Guisborough in northernEngland, Lawson said the game entailed one team chasing a man in aluminous dinner jacket who carries a shield called ``The Book,''while the opposing team defends him.   The players try to ``shoot'' him with paint guns while he triesto escape to a safe spot called ``The Publishers,'' and then toanother place called ``The Safe House,'' Lawson said.   He said he had not meant to offend anyone, and was trying tocontact Viking Penguin to apologize. He said that in view of thecriticism after the story surfaced in the local press, he mightdrop the Rushdie angle from the game.   ``Those who come to play are not coming to shoot Salman Rushdie.They come to have a fun day out and enjoy a variety of games,including this one,'' he said.   Lawson said another game being developed for the lodge is ``TheNoriega Game,'' in which one team defends a player representing theousted Panamanian dictator, while the other side tries to kidnaphim.</TEXT></DOC>
