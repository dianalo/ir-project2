In effect, the FortWashington, Pa., company has also written a survival manualfor manual products in the computer age. Its strategy forprolonging the life expectancy of its ledgers is simple: Itfocuses on selling to small businesses.   Figuring that most entrepreneurs can't afford acomputerized bookkeeping system or don't write enough checksto warrant one, Safeguard pitches its ledgers as the low-costalternative. A &quot;starter kit,&quot; with 300 checks, a ledger andenvelopes, sells for $102. Safeguard products, namedOne-Write, are bought by more than one million smallbusinesses. (Not an exclusive name, &quot;One-Write&quot; is also usedby rival makers of ledgers.)   &quot;We want to be in the small-business marketplace -- it'sthe most lucrative and fastest-growing in the country,&quot; saysVinton Bacon, who as chairman hopes to work magic inSafeguard's ledger domain. Indeed, the Small BusinessAdministration says the biggest growth in business startupsduring the past decade was among the self-employed and tinyfirms with a handful of employees. &quot;Many of them don't needautomated bookkeeping, and they can get by with one of thesecheck-writing systems,&quot; says Thomas A. Gray, the SBA's chiefeconomist.   But selling a manual accounting system in the computer ageis no easy task. Sales of Safeguard's One-Write products,which grew about 15% a year in the 1970s, have been runningflat (at approximately $120 million a year) since 1986, whenSafeguard was taken private in a buy-out by Mason Best Co., aDallas merchant bank.   Even in Safeguard's narrow niche, its competition isheavy. For example, Deluxe Corp., a big check-printingcompany in St. Paul, Minn., sells its own manual checkledgersystem through banks and a directmail operation.   Safeguard distributor John Kay concedes that getting newclients isn't easy. &quot;The problem is that you're competingagainst a computer, and so you have to rationalize with thecustomer over whether they really need that computer system,&quot;he says.   According to a survey this year by Link Resources Corp., aNew York research and consulting company, some 40% of smallbusinesses nationwide already use personal computers fortheir accounting, and about 21% have automated their payroll.The number of entrepreneurs switching to computer systems isgrowing: nearly 10% of small-business owners with computerswho don't already have automated payrolls plan to have thosein the next year.   &quot;Small-business owners say they are more likely to add anautomated-payroll function to their computers in the next 12months than any other function,&quot; says Thomas E. Miller,director of home office and small business research for Link.   Damn the computers, full speed ahead, say Safeguardofficials. If prospective clients do have computers, thecompany's sales personnel try to persuade them that One-Writeis faster and less costly to use. When a check is written,records are simultaneously created; there are no stubs,invoices or registers to fill out separarely. &quot;Just becausesomeone has a PC doesn't mean they don't need a One-Writesystem,&quot; Mr. Bacon says.   Safeguard distributor Pete Morley says some buildingcontractors in New Jersey are coming back to the One-Writesystem &quot;because they just don't have the volume of businessthey had before. A guy building 100 or 200 homes a year isnow building five or 10, and he doesn't need a computeranymore.&quot;   Safeguard also beefed up its sales force, to nearly 1,000from 750 in 1986; and the company says it will add 100distributors and associates a year for the next severalyears. The forces on the front line will allow Safeguard tofocus more on customer service -- something clients sayalready sets the company apart from competitors that sellprimarily through catalogs.   Distributors spend a considerable amount of hand-holdingtime training new clients to use the One-Write system, andthe attention seems to pay off, as 85% of new Safeguardclients are still buying the company's products a year later.   For years, much of Safeguard's new business has comethrough referrals from accountants. For example, RobertJampol of Red Bank, N.J., says he urges clients to buyOne-Write because it prevents him from getting &quot;lousy books.&quot;Now, the company is trying to get more banks' referrals in aneffort to compete with Deluxe Corp.   Since Safeguard distributors are entrepreneurs themselves(they own their distributorships and keep a 35% commission onOne-Write sales, averaging annual net income of $100,000),most try to portray themselves in sales pitches as moreattuned to small business-needs than is the competition.   Seattle distributor Dee Goedde tells &quot;true-life&quot; tales ofhow One-Write came in handy in the copy-supplies business sheused to own. &quot;I tell prospective clients that they didn't gointo business to keep books, and if they get bogged down withthe daily work of keeping books they aren't doing what theydo best,&quot; she says. Pasadena, Calif., distributor BillieRiggs reminds potential customers they'll get freeconsultation on how to fine-tune their record-keeping, &quot;aslong as they buy the system.&quot;   But all the salesmanship in the world can't stop progress.So Safeguard has gotten into the business of selling computerforms and accounting software (called One-Write Plus) thatcan be used in conjunction with its manual ledgers. Thosebusinesses represent a fraction of total sales now, but theyare growing, Safeguard says.   Says Mr. Bacon: &quot;You can't fight the technology. You'vegot to try to work with it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
