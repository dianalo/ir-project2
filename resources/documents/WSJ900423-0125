The payments move and the military revolt aren't directlyrelated, but growing internal unrest and the decision toslash interest expenses come after recent drops of more than10% in international prices for oil, which accounts for about90% of Nigeria's export revenues.</LP><TEXT>   The attempted coup, which began early yesterday, wasapparently put down after several hours of fighting forcontrol of the capital, Lagos. Troops loyal to the president,Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, fought with renegade soldiers seekingto break up Nigeria's federation of states and end Moslemdomination.   The coup attempt only adds uncertainty to Nigeria'stroubled financial situation. While bankers now know Nigeriaintends to cut interest payments, they aren't sure what rateit is prepared to pay. The Nigerian central bank, whichtelexed the country's intentions to banks last week, didn'tspecify what rate it would use to determine &quot;the reducedrate&quot; at which interest payments will be made.   In talks in London last month with foreign creditor banks,Nigerian officials apparently requested that interestpayments be set at 3% annually for 30 years on $5.4 billionof foreign bank debt. Bankers rejected this request. Nigeriapays about 10% on its foreign bank debt.   According to news agency reports, the debt immediatelyaffected by the move is $2.4 billion in trade credits thatrequire monthly interest payments. Nigeria also makesquarterly payments on $3 billion of medium-term commercialbank credit, which won't be affected until early July.   Although Nigeria hasn't specifically said so, manyanalysts say the recent fall in oil prices is an importantreason for the country's interest-payment cut. The price drop&quot;is a very important factor if Nigeria is going to pay itsoverseas debts,&quot; said Avinash Persaud, monetary economist atUBS Phillips andamp; Drew in London   Nigeria's main crude-oil export, so-called Bonny Light, isselling for about $16.15 a barrel, down almost $2 from amonth ago. Its current crude production is estimated around1.8 million barrels a day, about 200,000 barrels a day higherthan the quota set by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   According to the World Bank, Nigeria had $29.42 billion offoreign debt at the end of 1988. Of this, $11.4 billion isowed to private creditors, with the balance owed togovernments and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank.About half of the private debt is owed to banks, with thebalance consisting of suppliers' credits.   European and Mideast banks are the biggest private lendersto Nigeria, while U.S. banks account for less than one-tenthof private bank lending.</TEXT></DOC>
