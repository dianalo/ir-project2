McDermott, President ofCahners Publishing Company.andP;  Cahners publishes Datamation.andP;  Therefore,selecting him as the keynote speaker for this auspicious occasion of jointsponsorship was appropriate -- and predictable.andM;&quot;Cahners publishes 76 publications.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: They are also the organizers of a wide variety of computerconferences and exhibitions -- the significance of which may become apparentlater.andM;He began, as many keynote speakers do, by reminiscing about the history ofdata processing.andP;  (Note that today we say &quot;information systems,&quot; buthistorically, it was called &quot;data processing.&quot;andP;  Today's IS would have littlesubstance without data that is processed.)andP;  &quot;Initially, you could always seethe computer room.andP;  It was visible behind glass walls.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: How true!andP;  That was back when companies were proud to show offtheir multimillion dollar investment which was also &quot;proof&quot; of howtechnologically advanced they were.andP;  There is no point in showing offcomputers today, everybody has them!andM;&quot;The period of 1966 through 1974 was when in-depth computerization ofbusiness [occurred].&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: It began in a period of unrest and disillusionment never beforeexperienced in this country.andP;  It wasn't just the proliferation of computersthat made the glass walls disappear, it was also the very real need for solidwalls and security systems.andM;&quot;Computers have become ingrained in our daily lives.&quot;andM;&quot;You don't win anything unless you assume some risk.&quot;andP;  The information agewill change the way society looks and functions.&quot;andP;  The changes will begreater than those caused by the industrial revolution.andP;  &quot;Information is thefundamental currency!andP;  Matter is energy organized by information.&quot;andM;To impress us with the magnitude of the explosion of computing power -- notjust in MIPS, but in shear numbers of computers -- he said he had justreturned from a trip to Korea where he learned they expect to ship 2.4million (!) 386-based PCs this year.andM;CAN COMMENT: A staggening number -- especially when you consider that it isjust from Korea.andP;  The U.S., Japan, Taiwan, and others will also be shippingPCs.andP;  Of course, that number was not as staggering to those of you who readour special report on Korea that was published last February.andP;  In fact, forus, that number is just one more proof of Korea's potential to affect theworld computer market.andM;Mr.andP;  McDermott recalled that many people, including his own staff,underestimated the effect of the PC.andP;  Some thought its popularity would berestricted to hobbyists, or use as a toy.andP;  &quot;Some hobbyists were happier whentheir PC wasn't working -- then they had something to fix!&quot;andM;The speaker, bearing in mind the title of this conference, moved into therealm of forecasting.andP;  &quot;The pace of change isn't going to lessen.&quot;andP;  Heconsidered two areas:andM;1.andP;  electronic information deliveryandM;- Publishing will include electronic publishing, i.e., delivering informationdirectly to an individual screen.andM;- The publisher's computer will maintain a profile of each customer, notinginterests and needs.andP;  The computer will then select material according tothat profile -- which will be updated by comments from the customer and bytheir answers to questions from the computer.andM;- Each customer will receive a unique set of information tailored to theirprofile.andM;2.andP;  teaching machinesandM;- Most people are dissatisfied with the state of education in the U.S.andO;today.andP;  Electronic teaching will help improve the situation.andP;  &quot;It will helpto make the country more competitive.&quot;andM;- The teaching machines will utilize the (Skinner) concept of &quot;positivereenforcement.&quot;andM;- The machines will be economical.andP;  Fewer, more highly paid, teachers will berequired.andM;- Nintendo has given a grant for investigation into using their type ofpresentation as a teaching tool.andM;CAN COMMENT: IBM's impressive demonstration and DEC's stated intentions, asdocumented in CAN 262, certainly give credence to the availability ofmultimedia teaching tools.andP;  From what I saw, they will be effective,efficient, and fun -- which is the best way to learn!andP;  But I also believethey will never completely replace a good, live teacher.andM;The speaker offered a series of comments on DPMA.andP;  They would have beentotally inappropriate except that we now knew that he, as the publisher ofDatamation, is a partner of DPMA.andP;  I noted that some of the audience tookumbrage with his comments and still consider him an &quot;outsider.&quot;andP;  Hiscomments:andM;* The annual DPMA conference could be expanded to become &quot;the next NCC.&quot;andP;  Herecalled that in years past, the National Computer Conference (NCC) was thebiggest and best computer show of the year.andP;  It used to display everythingthat was new in the field.andP;  It was the focal point for new technology.andP;  Andthen it died!andP;  After a few derogatory references to COMDEX, he reiteratedthat the DPMA could expand its annual conference to become the &quot;new NCC.&quot;andM;CAN COMMENT: Recall that his company presents many computer conferences eachyear.andP;  Is he anticipating that his new association with DPMA will permitCahners to sponsor a mammoth conference that will challenge COMDEX?andM;* &quot;DPMA should consider changing its name.&quot;andP;  (The audience grumbled.andP;  Theywere not pleased with his suggestion!)andP;  &quot;Nobody has the title 'DP Manager'anymore.&quot;andM;* DPMA should expand into providing:andM;- marketing information -- gathered from its many membersandM;- product comparisons -- again, gathered from its many membersandM;- a forum on &quot;what is really happening within the industry&quot;andM;- rewards for new uses for computersandM;&quot;DPMA needs to assume a role of leadership.&quot;andM;Had he concluded his remarks before he started telling the DPMA how to runtheir association, the applause might have been more enthusiastic.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
