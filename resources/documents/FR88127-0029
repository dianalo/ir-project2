Pub.

Similarly,the law has long set aside a significant number of immigrant visas forimmediate relatives of permanent resident aliens. Because of the specialstatus accorded such alien relatives, some aliens who cannot otherwisequalify for immigration to the United States have found it expedient toengage in fraudulent marriages in order to gain an immigration benefit.Studies conducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service have revealedthat an estimated 30% of all spousal petitions for immigration involvesuspect martial relationships. Although participating in a fraudulent marriagemakes an individual subject to both criminal and administrative sanctions,in the past it has been difficult to detect such fraud, to prosecute individualsengaged in such fraud and to deport the alien beneficiaries of such fraud.Recognizing both the extent of the fraud and the difficulties which existin combatting such fraud, Congress enacted the Marriage Fraud AmendmentsAct of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-639), which addresses these problems in a numberof ways. First, section 2(a) of Pub. L. 99-639 creates a conditional basis of lawfulpermanent residence for aliens obtaining permanent residence within twoyears of marriage to a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident.It provides that the conditional basis shall be placed on the alien's permanentresidence for a period of two years, and establishes a procedure by whichthe alien may seek removal of the conditions at the end of the two-yearperiod. It further permits the revocation of an alien's permanent residentstatus under any of three conditions: (1) If it is determined within the two-year period that the marriage wasentered into for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit or hasbeen judicially annulled or terminated, or that a fee or other considerationwas given for the filing of a petition for an immigration benefit; (2) If the alien and his/her spouse fail to file a joint petition for removalof the conditional status within the 90 days immediately preceding thesecond anniversary of the alien's having obtained conditional permanentresidence, although such failure may be excused; or (3) If the petition to remove the conditional basis of the alien's residentstatus is denied. Second, section 2(b) of Pub. L. 99-639 provides for the deportation ofan alien whose permanent resident status is revoked. Third, section 4(a) of Pub. L. 99-639 precludes the approval of a petitionfiled on behalf of an alien who has conspired to engage in a fraudulentmarriage or who has attempted to obtain an immigration benefit on the basisof such marriage. Fourth, section 5 of Pub. L. 99-639 prevents an alien against whom an administrativeor judicial proceeding is pending concerning his or her right to enteror remain in the United States from obtaining an immigrant benefit on thebasis of a marriage occurring during such proceedings. Fifth, section 2(c) of Pub. L. 99-639 precludes the approval of a spousalimmigrant visa petition filed by an alien who obtained permanent residencethrough marriage unless: (1) The alien petitioner has been a permanent resident for at least fiveyears; or, (2) The alien establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the priormarriage was not entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws;or, (3) The alien's prior marriage was terminated through the death of his/herspouse.Sixth, section 2(d) of Pub. L. 99-639 provides for criminal penalties forindividuals who are convicted of having engaged in a fraudulent marriage.Seventh, section 3(a) of Pub. L. 99-639 requires that the petitioner andbeneficiary of a Petition to Classify Status of Alien Fiance or Fianceefor Issuance of Nonimmigrant Visa (Form I-129F) have met within the two-yearperiod immediately preceding the filing of the petition, unless such requirementis waived. Eighth, section 3(c) of Pub. L. 99-639 requires that an alien fiance orfiancee of a United States citizen must apply for permanent residence throughthe normal adjustment procedures contained in section 245 of the Immigrationand Nationality Act, as amended (the Act), instead of the automatic proceduresformerly contained in section 214(d) of the Act.Ninth, sections 2(e) and 3(b) of Pub. L. 99-639 create a new subsection,245(d), which precludes an alien who obtained conditional permanent residenceas the spouse of a citizen or lawful permanent resident from adjustingstatus on any other basis. It also precludes an alien who entered the UnitedStates as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(K) of the Act and failedto marry the citizen petitioner from obtaining permanent residence on anyother basis.In addition to creating new regulations, this rulemaking revises existingregulations, including those sections relating to:(1) Revocation of visa petitions to allow for revocation of petitions approvedcontrary to the provisions of Pub. L. 99-639,(2) Documentary requirements for immigrants to permit the readmission ofan otherwise eligible conditional resident,(3) Reentry permits and refugee travel documents to allow issuance of suchdocumentation to conditional residents,(4) Admission of aliens to provide procedures for the admission or readmissionof conditional residents, and(5) Deportation proceedings to provide for cancellation of an Order toShow Cause under certain circumstances and to specify the conditions underwhich an immigration judge shall grant conditional residence in a deportationhearing.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies thatthis rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This rule is not a major rule within the meaningof section 1(b) of E.O. 12291.This rule contains information collection requirements under the PaperworkReduction Act which have been or will be submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>8 CFR Part 1Administrative practice and procedure, Immigration.8 CFR Part 204Administrative practice and procedure, Immigration, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.8 CFR Part 205Administrative practice and procedure, Immigration.8 CFR Part 211Immigration, Passports and visas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.8 CFR Part 212Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Passport andvisas, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.8 CFR Part 214Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Employment, Foreign officials,Health professions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Students.8 CFR Part 216Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.8 CFR Part 223Aliens, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.8 CFR Part 223aImmigration, Refugees, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.8 CFR Part 235Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.8 CFR Part 242Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens.8 CFR Part 245Aliens, Immigration, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, Title I of Chapter 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations isproposed to be amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_DEFINITIONS</ITAG>1.

Because section 204(a)(2)(A)(ii) of theAct places the burden on the petitioner to establish ``by clear and convincingevidence'' that the prior marriage was not entered into for the purposeof evading the immigration laws, any reasonable doubts in the matter mustbe resolved by the petitioner. Failure to resolve such doubts may resultin the denial of the petition; however, such a denial will be without prejudiceto the filing of a new petition once the petitioner has acquired five yearsof lawful permanent residence. The director may choose to initiate deportationproceedings against the petitioner based upon information gained throughthe adjudication of the petition, but failure to initiate such proceedingsshall not establish that the petitioner's prior marriage was not for thepurpose of evading immigration laws. Unless the petition is approved, thebeneficiary shall not be accorded a filing date within the meaning of section203(c) of the Act based upon any spousal second preference petition filedwithin the prohibited period.(iii) The Service may not approve a visa petition filed on behalf of analien by a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, whichis based upon a marriage occurring after November 10, 1986 and while thealien is in either exclusion, deportation or rescission proceedings orjudicial proceedings relating thereto, until the alien has resided outsidethe United States for a two-year period after the date of the marriage.The period during which the alien is in such proceedings commences withthe issuance of the Order to Show Cause (Form I-221) or Notice to Applicantfor Admission Detained for Hearing before Special Inquiry Officer (FormI-122), or Notice of Intent to Rescind, as appropriate, and terminateswhen the alien departs from the United States or is found not to be excludableor deportable from the United States, or if the order to show cause orForm I-122 is cancelled by the district director of terminated by the immigrationjudge. Any petition filed during this period shall be denied without prejudiceto the filing of a new petition once the beneficiary has resided outsidethe United States for the required period of two years following the marriage.Furthermore, any such denial shall be without prejudice to the reopeningof petition proceedings should the beneficiary be found not deportableor excludable from the United States, or if the order to show cause ornotice of hearing is cancelled by the district director or immigrationjudge. The beneficiary shall not be accorded a filing date within the meaningof section 203(c) of the Act based upon any spousal petition filed withinthe prohibited period.(iv) Section 204(c) of the Act prohibits the approval of a visa petitionfiled on behalf of an alien who has attempted or conspired to enter intoa marriage for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.
