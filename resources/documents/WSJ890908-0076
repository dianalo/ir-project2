The reorganization will entail laying off about 11% of its total work force, selling numerous properties, recognizing a onetime charge of $45 million, discontinuing its regular dividend and distributing a special, one-time cash payout to shareholders.    &quot;We're going to make Dataproducts more focused, more like a start-up company, more entrepreneurial in nature,&quot; Jack Davis, the computer-printer maker's chairman and chief executive officer, said at a news conference here.    It wasn't clear, though, whether the action would mollify DPC Acquisition Partners, which has made a $15-a-share hostile bid for the company. The suitor, led by New York investment firm Crescott Inc., had no immediate comment on Dataproducts' plans.    But analysts said DPC probably won't just go away. &quot;I'm sure they're feeling quite frustrated,&quot; said William Easterbrook, of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;I don't see anything they've gotten out of this.&quot;    Mr. Davis declined to speculate on what DPC might do from here, but called its $283 million offer unacceptable. &quot;They have not been able to bring financing,&quot; he maintained.    In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Dataproduct's shares finished at $10, down $2.25.    Dataproducts, which for more than a year has been actively trying to devise a strategy to increase its value to holders, said it approached 70 concerns about purchasing the Woodland Hills, Calif., company for &quot;a premium price.&quot; But it received only two bids -- one from DPC and another from an unidentified concern -- and determined both to be inadequate.    Dataproducts and its investment bankers, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., also contacted 10 major banks to pursue a recapitalization -- an alteration in its capital structure that would have allowed for a huge payout to its investors. However, none of the banks was interested in financing such a transaction, Mr. Davis said.    Thus, Dataproducts has come up with the following blueprint instead:    --In an effort to streamline, Dataproducts will split into three sectors: printer equipment, printer supplies and solid-ink printer technology. Mr. Davis spoke most enthusiastically about the company's proprietary solid-ink color printer, expected to hit the market next summer.    --The company will phase out its domestic printer manufacturing operations, mostly in Southern California, and relocate those activities to its lower-cost plants in Hong Kong and Dublin. About 400 jobs will be cut as a result, and the company expects annual savings to be about $20 million from the move.    --It plans to sell its New England subsidiary, which provides government and military customers with data communications equipment, airborne equipment and printers. DPC is among the unit's prospective buyers. Dataproducts also has reached an agreement in principle to sell its Woodland Hills real estate holdings for $63 million.    --Assuming the company is able to complete the property sales, it expects to have enough cash on hand to declare a special dividend of about $3 a share. In addition, Dataproducts said it has decided to discontinue its eight-cent-a-share semiannual dividend.    --Dataproducts will most likely take the $45 million charge against earnings in the current quarter, which ends Sept. 23, and therefore anticipates a net loss for the period. The hit reflects the cost of moving operations overseas, severance compensation, write-offs of discontinued product lines, taxes on previously undistributed foreign earnings and legal expenses. For the year-ago quarter, the company posted profit of $1.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of $88.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
