The strike by the Writers Guild of America against the Allianceof Motion Picture and Television Producers, which began March 7,has shortened the season of several television shows, causedproduction postponement of spring replacement series and pilotshows, and could threaten next fall's television season.   In the commercial actors' strike, representatives for thecombined Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Radio andTelevision Artists met with a federal mediator Wednesday in NewYork City in a session that could lead to resumption of talks.   The 100,000 members of the two actors unions went on strikeMarch 21 against the Joint Policy Committee of the AmericanAssociation of Advertising Agencies and the Association of NationalAdvertisers.   The unions have since signed more than 550 interim contractswith companies that want to resume commercial production. Amongthem are advertising agencies for four of the presidentialcandidates _ Vice President George Bush, former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis andSen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, Screen Actors Guild spokesman MarkLocher said Wednesday.   The unions received a letter of written support from JesseJackson's campaign, which also noted that Jackson has not usedactors in his commercials.   In the writers' strike, the two sides have not met since a March10 federally mediated session, and there are no immediate prospectsof resumed negotiations. Informal talks two weeks ago between guildexecutive director Brian Walton and the producers' chiefnegotiator, Nick Counter, failed to bring results.   Meanwhile, scores of independent producers and some members ofthe alliance have requested separate negotiations with the guild.There have been no agreements reached as a result of those talks,guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said.   The majority of those seeking independent contracts with theguild are television production companies, Rhoden confirmed, butshe denied that reaching any agreement with them would create arift between working television writers and still-striking moviewriters.   ``If there were an independent agreement, and that is a very big`if,' it would have to be responsive to all our members' needs,''she said. ``Just because someone is doing a television show nowdoesn't mean they might not pick up a movie project next.''   A rift between television and movie writers during a 1985 strikeby the Writers Guild caused confusion and rancor among the members.During that strike, television writers felt they were being forcedon strike to support movie writers seeking higher residuals fromvideocassette sales.   Rhoden said there were no plans to picket next Monday's AcademyAwards show, although the guild will be monitoring it to make sureno violations occur with the guild-written script for thethree-hour broadcast on ABC-TV.   The script was about 90 percent complete when writers went onstrike. Rhoden also said the guild offered no guidelines on whetherstriking members who have received nominations should show up forthe awards.   ``We are leaving it up to them,'' she said.   Producers representatives have said several times that they arestanding by their last and final offer made at the start of thestrike. The Sherman Oaks-based alliance has said its proposal wouldraise writers' pay by $50 million over three years, despite callingfor a reduction in residual payments for some one-hour TV shows.   Writers have claimed their own analysis of the offer shows itwould result in a loss of more than $37.8 million for its 9,000members.</TEXT></DOC>
