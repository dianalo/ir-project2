Other legislators were more cautious in their reaction to theWhite House announcement that U.S. troops were being dispatched forwhat presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater termed a ``measuredresponse designed to show our staunch support to the democraticgovernment of Honduras.''   ``I just hope it's merited,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said,recalling a similar incident two years ago when the United Statesleaped to the aid of Honduras under circumstances many saw asexaggerated by the White House. ``I hope this is not anoverreaction.''   A Contra supporter, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he would``reserve judgment'' on the wisdom of Reagan's decision but thatU.S. combat involvement did not appear to be warranted.   ``I think that it's clear that the Honduran government sought ashow of support from the United States,'' McCain said. ``I believethese troops are not and must not be put into combat and to somedegree it will shift the focus from what the Sandinistras are doingto what our troops will be doing down there.''   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., appeared supportiveof the decision and said it was intended ``psychologically to givean indication that we are not just going to stand by and haveNicaragua ... make incursions into neighboring countries.''   But Byrd, D-W.VA., said the administration was going too far.   ``It's an overreaction,'' he said. ``The Sandinistas havecrossed over the border before and gone back.''   Jason Isaacson, a spokesman for Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,said the senator saw the administratoin action as an effort ``todivert attention from the Iran-Contra indictments and to turn upthe heat on Congress for more aid to the Contras.''   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said, ``I don't think the presidentreally had an alternative'' to sending the troops to Nicaragua.   ``The purpose is for them to demonstrate our commitment toregional peace and stability,'' Fields said. ``I lay the blame forthe president having no alternative at the feet of (House Speaker)Jim Wright and the Democrats who scuttled the Contra aid package.   Earlier Wednesday before the troop action was announced, Wright,D-Texas, said Nicaragua already was ordering its troops back fromthe incursion into Honduras and that plans for resumption ofcease-fire talks with the Contra rebels next week remain on track.   Wright said if those developments in fact occur, the seriousnessof the cross-border fighting will be greatly minimized and willhave little impact on the political climate in Congress towardfurther aid for the rebels.   But he said the reverse is also true, that aid prospects couldimprove if Sandinista troops do not withdraw.   Wright said word of the order for Sandinista troops to pull backhad been relayed to him by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister MiguelD'Escoto, who also said President Daniel Ortega was asking theUnited Nations to send an observer group to the border area.   At the same time, others in Congress were skeptical aboutadministration portrayal of the incursion as ``a genuine nationalsecurity problem for the United States,'' as Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz described it.   ``They have cried wolf so many times ... even supporters ofContra aid are somewhat skeptical,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,D-Vt., an aid opponent. ``It is apparently a major raid on a Contracamp in the jungles. Now, that does not pose a threat to Hondurasor its capital.''   ``I think you have to ask the question of whether 1,200Nicaraguans going across the Honduran border is a threat to U.S.national security,'' said Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.   ``In this situation there is questionable trust in theactivities of the White House and the State Department,'' Coelhosaid.   Wright said he still does not believe support exists in Congressfor any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and repeatedthat congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about a furtherpackage of purely ``humanitarian'' aid.   But he did question the judgment of Ortega in mounting themilitary action on the border. ``I would have preferred certainlythat no armed forces of any country enter into the territory ofanother country,'' Wright said.   Meanwhile, partisan warfare broke out on the House floor afterDemocrats accused Republicans of abandoning the Nicaraguan Contrarebels, and a GOP lawmaker's microphone was cut off during an angryresponse.   In a floor speech, Coelho triggered a verbal brawl when he saidthe rebels had supported a Democratic aid package which wasnarrowly defeated on March 3, but were ordered by the White Housenot to lobby in favor of it.   Republicans overwhelmingly voted against the $30 million``humanitarian'' aid bill.   ``We now know the truth,'' Coelho said. ``The Republicansabandoned the Contras to the politics of cynicism ....''   Coelho's remarks drew shouts of ``Shame! Shame!'' from theRepublican side of the chamber, and Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.,rose a few minutes later to condemn Coelho and Wright.   ``In 10 years, Jim and Tony, ... I have never heard on thisfloor so obnoxious a statement as I heard from Mr. Coelho,'' Dornansaid. ``Thanks to the radical and liberal leadership in this House,the communists are winning a major victory.''   Dornan referred to the White House assertion that Nicaraguantroops had crossed the border into Honduras seeking to destroyContra supply centers and to deal a death blow to the rebels.   Under House rules, members are allowed to speak for up to oneminute on any subject before the chamber begins its business eachday. Dornan's heated remarks continued past the two-minute mark,and Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., presiding in the speaker's chair,sought to gavel him down.   Dornan, shouting and pounding on the podium, continued to speak,however, to cheers and applause from Republican colleagues.Apparently at Ackerman's request, Dornan's microphone was cut offso that there was no longer any sound on the House televisionsystem.   That brought renewed outrage from the GOP side, which alreadyhas a long-simmering feud with the Democratic leadership over whatthey consider heavy-handed tactics used to control proceedings inthe chamber.   Rep. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., objected that Ackerman was not actingin accord with House rules and was attempting to ``close down theprocess of free speech.''   Ackerman responded that Dornan had ``greatly exceeded the limitand abused the privilege'' of one-minute speeches, and that hesimply was trying to maintain House decorum and order.</TEXT></DOC>
