Nomatter what the speed of the transmission, it has got to beat copying filesto and from diskettes to share information.andP;  When you finally give in totemptation and connect those Macs, you may want to consider the three networkoperating systems  (NOSS) offered by Dayna, Information PresentationTechnologies (IPT), and TOPS.andP;  As far as NOSS go, they are as different asapples and oranges, so deciding among them will be easy after you define yourpreferences.andM;Four things to consider before connecting your computers include: 1) who willbe installing and maintaining the network, 2) what type of security isneeded, 3) what resources will be shared and among how many users, 4) andwhat you need in the way of additional, network-specific applications.andP;  Thethree operating systems I examined-daynanet, PSN, and Tops-each seemed to bedesigned to address these questions differently.andM;One obvious difference between the three NOSS is the type of network eachoffers.andP;  PSN is a peer-to-peer network that makes use of Appletalk to enablecommunications between Macs.andP;  Peer-to-peer, or distributed, networks allowall computers in the network to act as servers to share data with the others.andO;TOPS is a peer-to-peer network that connects Macs to DOS-or Unix-basedcomputers.andP;  Daynanet also allows you to incorporate DOS-based PCs and Macsinto the same network, but does so through a network server rather thanoffering peer-to-peer communications.andM;InstallationandM;If you intend to have a single network administrator, you won't be botheredtoo much by the Daynanet installation routine, but if you want to add anetwork that everyone with a Mac on his desk can install and maintain, theneither PSN or TOPS will suit you better.andP;  The Daynanet installation is agruesome NetWare 286 lookalike that requires hours for hard drive surfacescanning and swapping between some nine disks just to get the file servergoing.andP;  Once the file server is up, the workstation installations are moresimilar to the entire installation process for either the PSN or TOPSnetwork.andM;Because Daynanet is a NetWare product by Dayna, NetWare users will becomfortable with the installation procedure.andP;  The server must be an 80286 or80386 PC-compatible computer, but at the time of this review, PS/2 platformswere not supported as servers.andP;  Daynanet includes an AppleTalk board andsoftware for the server, Macintosh workstations, and PC workstations.andP;  I wassurprised that, while the PS/2 is not supported as a server, it is supportedas a workstation.andP;  I found six bound manuals in my Daynanet package: one forinstallation, one for installation and administration, one foradministration, two for users, and a guide to familiarize me with all theother guides.andP;  The latter guide pointed me first to chapter two of aninstallation guide for instructions on installing the system.andM;That chapter turned out to be an overview, so I expected chapter three tohave the step-by-step instructions.andP;  It did, but it pointed me to appendicesA, B, and C in the first three steps.andP;  Despite this initial frustration, therest of the installation procedure seemed well organized in one chapter forthe server and one for the workstations.andM;Because I didn't have a bad block list for the hard drive in my Compaq, I hadto run COMPSURF to analyze the disk.andP;  After three hours in which no badblocks were reported for the 40MB hard drive, COMPSURF finished and the drivewas ready to be initialized.andP;  The next step, installing the software,required patient disk swapping, but reported no errors.andP;  I rebooted the newlyinstalled server system and watched as it executed an automatic configurationroutine.andP;  This routine reported two errors but concluded that theconfiguration was successful.andP;  I thought the server was ready forworkstations.andM;Loading the workstation software was as easy as you'd expect on a Macintosh.andO;I inserted the disk, executed the installation program and then copied acouple of icons and installed NetWare in the Apple menu.andP;  When I tried to login to the server, all systems seemed to work.andP;  The connection showed oneserver available.andP;  I selected that server and went through the procedure ofspecifying user name and password, as well as selecting the disk volume tomount.andP;  When I thought the procedure was complete, an error message appearedto inform me that the server volumes had minor problems that I could elect tocorrect or not.andP;  This message reappeared whether or not I attempted tocorrect the problem when prompted.andP;  I tried reinstalling the server.andP;  I readtechnical notes on the workstation utility disk.andP;  I reinstalled theworkstation.andP;  During all of my attempts, I searched through all six manualsfor information about hard drive errors.andP;  I looked for information about theerror codes that were reported during the server configuration.andP;  There didn'tseem to be any suggestion in the documentation of what to do when theseerrors occurred.andP;  I felt like I had been asked to pull weeds from a fieldthat had no above ground plant life because there was simply no indication ofwhere the problem might exist or how bad the problem might be.andM;A call to technical support seemed in order since the network wasn't.andP;  Myproblem initially stumped the technical support representative.andP;  We walkedthrough several steps that the representative thought might fix the problem,but none worked.andP;  After several attempts, the representative said that shewould call me back after talking with an engineer.andP;  She called with an answerwithin two hours of my original call.andP;  The problem turned out to be that thetwo file that reported an error code during the automatic configuration hadnot been installed properly.andP;  I actually had the network running within ashort time of her call.andP;  To avoid the problem, I made sure the two filesappeared o the original  diskette and then  used DISKCOPY rather than COPY tocreate working copies of the DaynaNet original disks.andP;  The two files were ofzero length, so DOS COPY could create them on  the working diskette.andP;  Withall the effort and time invested, I was glad to have an operational network.andM;Perhaps this seemed like a lot of effort only because the previous twoinstallations, PSN and TOPS, had been so effortless.andP;  Basically, the steps Idescribed above for loading the software on the Daynanet workstation are thesame steps required for installing the PSN and TOPS software.andP;  Yet since bothof these operating systems are for peer-to-peer networks, each workstationrequires the additional step of publishing the data that it will share.andP;  Atthat point, you have a basic network.andP;  Both of these programs include onlyone manual for network installation and operation for each network node.andO;Daynanet did not include enough copies for all possible users.andP;  TOPS alsoincludes separate e-mail and file translation manuals.andP;  Both TOPS and PSNhave well-organized documentation with good illustrations and concise steps.andM;Actually, there were additional steps for both of these operating systems.andO;Since PSN provides local security, I had to specify whether I wanted thislocal security installed.andP;  I also had to increase the limit of open files andchange the heap size in the boot block on the SE/30 to a medium systembecause of crashes I experienced.andP;  This option was only described in loosesheets that came with my documentation.andP;  For TOPS, I had to run separateinstallation programs for the print spooler, the file translation utilities,and the electronic mail application Inbox.andP;  These were installed on eachworkstation.andM;As I mentioned before, PSN and TOPS require that shared data be published oneach computer that is to act as a file server, but Daynanet does not requirethat step.andP;  That is because all volumes on a Daynanet server areautomatically accessible to the network.andP;  instead, you must define a userlist on the Daynanet server to determine which users have access to theserver's volumes.andP;  Users will then be prompted at log in to specify whichvolumes to mount locally.andP;  With the peer-to-peer networks, volumes ofpublished data must also be selected by local users to be mounted, and PSNalso supports user lists to limit who has access to published data.andP;  Ofcourse, all of the user's local information can be saved so that each time hereboots his computer he does not need to specify what volumes he would liketo mount (or publish in the case of peer-to-peer networks).andM;MaintenanceandM;While the PSN operating system is easy to install and understand, a greatpossibility exists for duplicate information.andP;  Each workstation thatpublishes data must define a user and group list and assign access rights toeach member of these lists.andP;  With multiple users entering this information ontheir own computers, problems could arise with users having multiplepasswords or being added to incorrect groups among the different servers.andO;IPT reduced the likelihood of error and improved the ease with which thesystem can be maintained by storing this information in files that can betransferred from one server to another.andP;  This method also simplifies addingusers after the network is installed.andP;  The user need only be added on onecomputer, then the appropriate files can be copied from one server to thenext.andM;Daynanet also requires that users and groups be defined, but if multipleservers are used in the network, the administrator will have to define eachuser list separately.andP;  With up to 255 servers in a network, and up to 100users per server, this is a huge undertaking.andP;  Just to add a single user to amultiserver network requires redundant effort.andP;  Daynanet does not offer anysolution to this problem, but with a separate program not provided by Dayna,you can backup user and group information by backing up only the &quot;bindery&quot;and possibly restore that information on another server.andM;Since TOPS does not require user and group lists, maintenance is somewhatsimplified.andP;  While this is certainly a benefit, it does limit security, butI'll get back to that later.andM;One useful maintenance function is provided by each of the three NOSS: allsystems provide a means of learning who is active on the network.andP;  For PSNand TOPS, any user can discover who is accessing his published data, but forDaynanet, only the system administrator can discover who is active on thenetwork.andP;  PSN provides the most limited information by allowing a user to seewho has mounted data from his computer.andP;  it does not inform him what volumesare mounted by these users.andP;  TOPS goes one step further by listing the usersaccording to which volumes they have mounted.andP;  Daynanet promises to providethe most information.andP;  It offers a utility that should allow systemadministrators to learn what activities are taking place at each workstation.andM;When I tried to access this information on the Compaq server, a user on theSE/30 was executing Word from the server directory and a user on the Mac IIwas executing Autocad with a file loaded from the server directory.andP;  Theboxes on the MONITOR screen were all blank, though.andP;  For each workstation,nothing appeared under the heading &quot;Files&quot; and nothing appeared under theheading &quot;Stat.&quot; Even when both users tried to print, the MONITOR screenappeared blank.andP;  The documentation for this option was not thorough enough toexplain what was going on; it only promised to let me  view the activity&quot; ofworkstations.andP;  The workstations appeared active to me when I looked at theirscreens, but they didn't when I looked at the server's MONITOR screen.andM;Unfortunately, none of these NOSS offer network users the opportunity to seewho else may be accessing data that they have mounted from another server.andO;If, for example, a user needs to be able to open a file and retrieveinformation from it, depending on the applications in use, he may be lockedout if another user has that file open before him.andP;  The user must wait for anindefinite time to retrieve his information because he has no way ofdiscovering who has the file open.andP;  if he could discover this, he could askthe user currently accessing the data to give him the information he needs orto relinquish it momentarily so that he can retrieve information.andP;  Networksare supposed to make it easier for people to work together with access to thesame data.andM;When a reason arises to take a server off the network, all three operatingsystems have good user notification schemes.andP;  Daynanet and PSN have fixedtime limits (one minute and three minutes, respectively) in which users withinformation mounted from the downed server are notified.andP;  After the timelimit elapses, the server is downed and other users are left to remove themounted volumes that are no longer available.andP;  TOPS provides a warning thatis active for no specific time limit.andP;  You can continue the shut down processat any time.andP;  When you continue the process, volumes are automaticallyunmounted on other users' systems and the system shuts down.andP;  If no usershave mounted PSN or TOPS data, the server will shut down without delay.andO;Oddly, Daynanet offers a message to the system administrator when users havefiles open on the server at the time of shutdown.andP;  However, this NOS does notnotify PC users on the network when the network is shutting down.andM;Of the three NOSS, TOPS offers the best notification when network errorsoccur.andP;  When the connection between an active client and server fails formore than one minute, TOPS sends a message to both computers to inform usersthat there is a problem on the network.andP;  I corrected the problem as soon asthe messages appeared, and the file transfer from server to client completedwithout error.andP;  PSN did not offer a warning message, but when a connectionfailure was corrected in just over one minute after being introduced, thefile transfer completed without error.andP;  Only the Daynanet client could notrecover when a one-minute connection failure was introduced.andP;  Under Daynanet,the client hung and file transfer was not completed.andM;Daynanet offers the most complex network maintenance scheme.andP;  BecauseDaynanet is a file server-based NOS, some utilities are available to thesystem administrator only on the file server itself, and some utilities areavailable on the network nodes.andP;  Users, groups, and security may bemaintained from the node only.andP;  The network activity monitor, login enableand disable functions, and print spooling functions are only available fromthe file server.andP;  With TOPS and PSN, whether you use only nondedicatedservers or choose to dedicate a computer to be a file server, all networkmaintenance for file servers takes place at the file server itself.andP;  You donot need two computers  for the network administration.andM;Since Daynanet  requires that a user log in to mount  server volumes, thesystem administrator must unmount server volumes and reconnect to the serverto perform maintenance functions from a computer at which another user haslogged in.andP;  Likewise PSN requires users to log in, but when the user attemptsto access maintenance functions, he need only type in the systemadministrator's ID and password.andP;  PSN employs a more graceful way ofattending to server administration functions.andM;SecurityandM;PSN offers more in the way of security than either of the other two operatingsystems because it may be configured to require users to log in not only toaccess remote information, but also to access local volumes.andP;  This preventsunauthorized users from simply turning a computer on and retrievingconfidential information from that system.andP;  if a computer is turned on and auser has logged in to mount local and network volumes, another securityfeature may be employed when that user steps away from the computer.andP;  Withouthaving to shut down the system, the user may set the computer to prompt for apassword before activity can continue.andP;  In this way, the network and thelocal computer are secure even after users have logged in.andM;in addition, with PSN, user access may be defined by the administrator(s) notonly for volumes published by the server, but also for folders and fileswithin the published volume.andP;  Privileges may be assigned separately for usersand for groups of users.andP;  PSN employs Appleshare security and so offers twobasic categories of security: rights to see an object and rights to modify anobject.andP;  Within a published volume, you may define which users have access towhich folders and files.andP;  With this you can, for example, publish a volumeand provide users with the ability to see and modify a folder containing wordprocessor files.andP;  Within that folder, you may have a separate folder for yourpersonal files and ensure that others cannot access it simply by denying themthe right to see folders within the word processor folder.andP;  Yet, if you wishto organize files within the word processor folder so that those pertainingto separate projects are stored separately, you will have to provide usersthe right to see and modify folders within the word processor folder.andP;  Inthat case, you will need to specify that users do not have rights to seefiles within your personal folder.andM;With this Appleshare security, icons indicate to users what access isavailable.andP;  Folders with contents that are not accessible to a user appear ingrey on the user's screen.andP;  I would prefer that the folder not be visible atall because it can certainly tempt someone into wanting to break security andsee what it is he cannot access.andP;  These grey folders also clutter a user'sscreen with icons that are useless to him.andP;  Files do not appear at all on auser's screen if he has no rights to see the files within a folder.andP;  Instead,an icon in the upper corner of the window associated with an open foldercontains a &quot;no files&quot; icon.andP;  Another icon may appear to indicate the user hasno rights to modify the folder's contents.andP;  These icons help users understandhow the network is organized by indicating what rights they have before theyattempt to do anything with the data they are accessing from the server.andM;I should also mention that not all grey folders are useless screen clutter.andO;Appleshare also offers a &quot;drop box&quot; folder that appears grey with an arrowabove it if users have modify rights but no rights to see the files orfolders contained within.andP;  This can act as a personal mailbox for the ownerof the folder, and other users can copy files and folders into it if theywant the owner to see them.andP;  Unfortunately, like the US Mail, once you dropsomething in the box, there is no getting it back.andP;  If you change your mind,you had better drop a retraction in the box, too.andM;Daynanet also offers AppleShare security, so it has the same problems andfeatures mentioned above.andP;  However, it also offers NetWare security levels.andO;While this makes for more flexibility in access privileges, it can get alittle confusing.andP;  AppleShare rights to see folders result in differentNetWare search rights, depending on whether the folder is private or public.andO;Once you learn both security schemes, you may even enjoy the flexibility.andM;Like PSN, Daynanet also requires users to log in for access to networkvolumes.andP;  TOPS does not require this, nor does it offer the variety ofsecurity options Daynanet and PSN offer.andP;  If you publish a volume on thenetwork, users who mount it have access to all the information within thatvolume.andP;  You may limit which users have access only by assigning a singlepassword to the published data and notifying privileged users.andP;  The volumemay be published with &quot;read only&quot; access, but this applies to all users whomount that volume.andP;  &quot;Read only&quot; access enables users to view the contents ofa volume, but not to make any changes.andP;  Users may also set the volume to&quot;read only&quot; when they mount it so that they don't have to fear inadvertentlychanging information that they do not want to change.andP;  Since this does notaddress the problem of limiting the amount of data to which users haveaccess, TOPS allows you to select individual folders to publish whenpublishing an entire volume is unwise.andP;  Folders may be published with thesame options described for volumes.andP;  In this way, network users are onlyaware of data to which they have access; there are no grey folders to clutterthe screen.andP;  Even though TOPS offers the least security, what it offers iswell implemented.andP;  Resource SharingandM;No network is worthwhile if it doesn't allow you to efficiently share theresources, be it data or peripherals, that you need to share.andP;  PSN offersonly the ability to share data; it does not facilitate peripheral sharing.andO;TOPS and Daynanet both offer the ability to share data and spool printrequests.andP;  Both of these operating systems provide some access to DOS data aswell as Macintosh data, and TOPS also provides for data exchange with Unixnodes.andP;  IPT offers a separate package to facilitate data sharing between Macsand Unix and plans to support DOS data exchange in a release later this year.andO;None of the NOSS offers a means to share modems.andM;When exchanging data among Macintosh nodes, each NOS offers basically thesame functionality.andP;  When network-aware applications such as Pagemaker andWord try to access a file that another user has open, the file cannot beopened a second time.andP;  This prevents multiple users from attempting to modifya file simultaneously and overwriting one another's work.andP;  I was disappointedto discover that you cannot even open a &quot;read only&quot; file when another userhas opened the file before you.andP;  I tried to open a Word document from twoseparate workstations, but was locked out on the second workstation.andP;  I wouldprefer that after the first user begins to modify a file, subsequent userswho attempt to open a file can read, but not modify the data.andP;  This isprobably more a function of the application than of the operating system.andM;When exchanging data among Macintosh nodes using non-networkawareapplications, such as Autocad release 10, users will not be prevented fromopening and modifying the same files simultaneously.andP;  Whoever saves hischanges first will see that they were overwritten by the second user.andP;  Noneof the NOSS offers complete protection against this, but TOPS offers a smallstep toward a solution.andP;  When publishing a volume, users may specify onewriter only.&quot; With this option, you can ensure that multiple users do not tryto open and save separate changes to the same file when non-networkawareapplications are used.andP;  Unfortunately, this option limits the f le operationsonly for users who have mounted the data; the file may be opened and modifiedon the server even when one other network user has the file open.andM;When I tested file sharing with Word, AutoCAD, and Pagemaker under all threeoperating systems, they performed the same except for TOPS'S ability to lockout a second nonserver user and PSN'S inability to load AutoCAD files frommounted volumes.andP;  The IPT technical support people attempted to contactAutodesk, but could not come up with a solution to the problem before thisarticle went to print.andP;  The print queue, publish it, and attach a printer toit.andP;  At that point, users may select the queue name rather than the printername from the Chooser menu of printers.andP;  This method worked well whether Iselected the printer queue or the printer name.andP;  If I selected the queue, theapplication printed in background mode and I could resume working.andP;  If Iselected the printer itself, the application did not print in background modeand I had to wait until the print queue cleared before my printout began.andM;TOPS works in a similar fashion, but differences arise from the fact that thespooler is specific for each workstation.andP;  To specify whether printing shouldbe spooled, users select the &quot;TOPS Spooler&quot; option from the Apple menu andmark the box &quot;Print spooled output while I work&quot; according to theirpreferences.andP;  If a user elects to spool print jobs while he continues towork, he can determine what files are still left to be printed when heaccesses the spooler option.andP;  The print jobs are listed in the order theywill be printed.andP;  If he changes his preference so that printing does not takeplace in the background, the next print job will still wait for any job thatis currently printing, but will begin immediately after that.andP;  Other printjobs are held in the queue until the preference is changed again.andP;  Thespooler offers flexibility to the network user because he can prioritize hisprint jobs in the spool and specify which one should be printed beforeothers.andP;  He can also delete spool jobs from his queue.andM;The TOPS user has more control over his print requests than Daynanet usershave, and also more feedback about the printer status.andP;  TOPS Spool offers astatus line to inform users of what is currently being printed and what statethe printer is in.andP;  If the printer jams, for example, information about whatis printing and that the printer is jammed appears in the status line.andP;  Withthe ability to see what is currently printing, users can better judge whethertheir print jobs will begin soon.andP;  If someone has just sent War and Peace tothe printer from another workstation, the TOPS user will know that it isprinting but won't know how many copies may be waiting in other users' printspools.andP;  The Daynanet user won't know that War and Peace is printing until hegoes to the printer to look for his printout.andM;For each of the three operating systems, users should be  very comfortablewith the network  no matter what their levels of computer expertise.andP;  Ifusers are not familiar enough with their computers to understand the conceptof networking, the operating systems can be installed by a more experiencedperson and quickly explained.andP;  For PSN and Daynanet, one new concept thatinexperienced users will need to have explained is logging in.andP;  For Daynanetand TOPS, the concept of print spooling will need to be explained.andP;  Usersshould find both new concepts easy to understand once they see them working.andM;With TOPS, access is basically the same for local data and data accessed overthe network.andP;  For Daynanet and PSN, the new icons associated with AppleSharesecurity must be explained to the inexperienced user.andP;  In addition, for bothPSN and Daynanet, data may not be copied from the network to the desktop.andM;A warning message appears when you attempt to copy from shared volumes undereither of these systems.andP;  This restriction is does not apply to TOPS.andM;Network Specific SoftwareandM;For a network specific application, I tested QuickMail.andP;  The SE/30 wasinstalled as the mail server and the Mac II as a client.andP;  The mailadministration program on the server generates reports and can mail them tousers.andP;  QuickMail performed equally under each operating system and reportswere generated for and mailed to a user on the client computer.andP;  TOPSincludes its own e-mail program in addition to any third-party packages thatmay work.andP;  Where to Go from HereandM;After all of my testing, I decided that the products were each suited to adifferent environment.andP;  If security was the most important factor to me, Iwould definitely install PSN to meet my security requirements for a networkof 10 users or less.andP;  I would install Daynanet on a larger EtherTalk networkwhere several users need to constantly access the same set of files.andM;If I had to incorporate DOS or Unix into the network, I would choose TOPSinstead.andP;  I would even consider TOPS for a large network if I had a computerto set aside as a file server (even though TOPS does not require it).andO;Whatever your needs might be, one of these three operating systems should beable to satisfy you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
