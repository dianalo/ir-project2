The resulting thermoremanence(M/sub R/), which decays very slowly with time, diminishes with increasingT and vanishes at T/sub N/. Thus, the long-range antiferromagnetism appearsto coexist with spin-glass ordering. Measurements of M/sub R/ with increasingT were also made for different cooling fields (H/sub c/{sub 1}) The changesof M/sub R/ with H/sub c//sub l/ and T are found to reduce to a universalrelationship between the temperature-normalized quantities, m = M/subR//M{sub 0}(T) and h = H/sub c//sub l/ /H{sub 0}(T). Setting both theinitial slope of m vs h and the saturation m at high h equal to unity,we determine that M{sub 0}(T) = M{sub 0}(0) exp (-T/T{sub 0}), with M{sub0}(0) = 0.82{mu}/sub B//Tb atom and T{sub 0} = 4.3 K, and that H{sub0}(T) varies analogously, with H{sub 0}(0) = 225 kOe and the same T{sub0}. A similar temperature scaling of M/sub R/ vs H/sub c//sub l/ , withsimilar exponential forms for M{sub 0}(T) and H{sub 0}(T), has been deducedearlier for Ag-Mn and other canonical spin glasses.</TEXT></DOC>
