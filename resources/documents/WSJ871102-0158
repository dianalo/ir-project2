GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXESTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   THE STOCK MARKET'S comedown has carried over into the market for closely held companies. Brokers and buyers of small and medium-sized concerns say purchase prices are dropping sharply. Sellers, meanwhile, are delaying in the hope that prices will rebound. As a result, many transactions are on hold, while others are being restructured.    &quot;It's clear values we ascribed to companies just a month ago have changed,&quot; says Robert S. Ehrlich, a New York investment banker who works with middle-market companies. &quot;I think prices across the board have declined 30% to 40%.&quot;    Few people are willing to predict how permanent the damage will be. Much depends on the long-term impact of the stock-market crash on the economy. But that very uncertainty is prompting buyers to proceed cautiously. &quot;Perceptions have changed dramatically,&quot; says Edward McGrath, a business broker in San Francisco. &quot;I think every deal I've heard of is on hold.&quot;    Foreign companies, which in recent years have paid handsome prices for small U.S. companies, are holding back. Some are worried about the direction of the U.S. economy, says Arthur Perrone, head of mergers and acquisitions at Geneva Cos., a business-brokerage concern in Costa Mesa, Calif. Others, he says, are having trouble raising acquisition capital in their own depressed stock markets.    PUBLICLY TRADED STOCKS often are used as a benchmark to set the price of closely held companies in similar lines of business. As publicly traded stocks soared in recent years, prices of closely held companies rose with them.    &quot;You almost didn't care what you paid, because you could sell it for more in a year,&quot; says Kurt Kamm of Kidd, Kamm andamp; Co., a leveraged-buyout group in Los Angeles. &quot;All that's changed in about a week.&quot;    Mr. Ehrlich, the New York investment banker, offers an example of how far prices have fallen and how radically the landscape has been altered. He is working on a transaction involving two electronics businesses, one a closely held California company and the other a subsidiary of a publicly traded New York concern.    Until two weeks ago, negotiators for the two sides had agreed to value the California company at $3.5 million and the New York concern's subsidiary at $1.5 million. Their plan was to have the California company acquire the subsidiary, paying for the purchase with its own shares. The California company then would go public, which would enable the New York company to cash out, if it wished, by selling those shares.    The market crash, however, has forced the negotiators to slash their appraisals of both businesses. They now value the California company at $2.5 million and the subsidiary at only $750,000.    Moreover, because the crash -- at least for now -- has made it impossible for the California company to go public, the acquisition roles have been reversed. The New York company now plans to acquire the California company, combine the operation with its own subsidiary, and then spin off the resulting business to its own shareholders through a stock dividend.    The possibility of a steep recession also is changing the nature of sought-after acquisition candidates. Businesses that sell highpriced consumer goods are falling out of fashion. &quot;Companies with proven resistence to recessions are more salable,&quot; says Steven J. Gilbert, managing general partner of Chemical Venture Partners, the leveraged-buyout arm of Chemical Bank.    In a downturn, Mr. Gilbert says, &quot;people who clean carpets are going to do better than people who sell carpets.&quot;    ---   Owners' Group Pushes for Tax Increases    Small-business owners are usually among the last people interested in a tax increase. But that's what the nation's second-largest independent small-business group is asking for.    Rattled by the stock market's plunge and the specter of recession, the 50,000-member National Small Business United last week called on Congress and the White House to trim the federal budget deficit by at least $45 billion through an equal mix of spending cuts and tax increases. A reduction of that size would be nearly twice the $23 billion minimum cut required under the Gramm-Rudman legislation.    &quot;We believe that any damage caused by higher taxes pales in comparison to the damage that will be caused if the federal deficit is allowed to continue at the current levels,&quot; said John Galles, NSBU's executive vice president.    The organization urged lawmakers to raise revenue by temporarily freezing federal income tax rates at their current levels and by imposing a surtax of up to 5%. Under last year's tax reform act, the top corporate tax rate is scheduled to drop to 34% next year from 40% this year, after being lowered from 46% last year.    Small Business United's much bigger rival, the 500,000-member National Federation of Independent Business, declined to second NSBU's recommendation of a tax increase. Instead, the federation has urged Congress to trim the federal deficit solely through spending reductions. &quot;As far as going soft on taxes, we're not going to do that,&quot; a federation spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
