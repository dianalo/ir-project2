Bush went to the annual gathering of the world's seven largestindustrial democracies last week with a bag full of ideas onreducing Third World debt, promoting democracy in Poland andHungary and cleaning up global pollution.   But he carried little in hard cash to back up the initiatives.He proposed no new money for the pollution cleanup, conceded thatthe United States was dependent on others to back his Third Worlddebt plan and offered what some thought was an embarrassingly small$125 million package of assistance to Hungary and Poland.   Despite the slim wallet, however, Bush managed to a significantdegree to control the agenda of the meeting with the leaders ofFrance, Britain, Japan, West Germany, Italy and Canada.   That was quite a feat for a nation that is now the world'slargest debtor country, a nation that must depend on $10 billion ininvestment from the rest of the world each month to finance itshuge budget and trade deficits.   The final communique issued at the end of the three-daygathering mirrored to a great extent the goals that theadministration had set coming into the meeting:   _On Third World debt, the seven summit nations gave theirblessing to the debt forgiveness plan first unveiled on March 10 byTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Japan even announced that it wasputting up more money to support the proposal, boosting itsfinancial backing to $5.5 billion. The administration wasdisappointed that negotiations between Mexico and its creditorbanks, taking place in New York, were not completed by the time thesummit ended, but officials say they believe those talks soon willprovide the first success story for the Brady initiative.   _On global pollution, the summit, as Bush had hoped, made theenvironment a top priority for the first time since thesegatherings began 15 years ago. The final communique called for anacceleration in preparations for an international conventiondesigned to draw up guidelines for dealing with the threat ofglobal warming and also addressed such issues as depletion of theozone layer, ocean pollution and loss of forest land.   _On East-West relations, Bush scored his biggest triumph. Hemanaged to seize the initiative in this area through hishistory-making trip to Poland and Hungary immediately before thestart of the summit. The other summit countries, many of whom hadearlier announced their own efforts to foster economic reforms inCommunist Eastern Europe, endorsed U.S. proposals to advance theseefforts. The final communique, however, did not contain anyspecifics on how much money the nations would be willing to put up.   Despite its success in Paris, the administration is facingquestions about America's current financial predicament and what itmeans for the country's long-run position on the world stage.   ``Because of the tight fiscal constraints, we are not in aposition to put a lot of resources to deal with (global) economicproblems,'' Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the JointEconomic Committee of Congress, said during a review of the Parissummit.   ``It seems to me the baton is passing to other nations betterable to provide financing than we are,'' Hamilton told Brady.   Brady conceded that the inability of the United States to put upresources to back its global initiatives was a ``serious worry''but he said the Paris summit demonstrated that the Western leadershad the will to work together to solve common problems.   Some observors, however, believe the Paris summit may mark thebeginning of a transition to a new world order in which the UnitedStates is now first among equals with the other summit countries.   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for InternationalEconomics, a Washington think-tank, gave Bush high marks for beingable to push U.S. initiatives in Paris while at the same timeurging other countries to foot the bill.   Bergsten said the key test will come in whether the UnitedStates is willing to share decision-making on international issuesas it seeks funding help from other countries.   ``The Paris summit could mark the first early step away from aU.S.-led world to a ... world where the United States puts up theideas and looks to others to put up the money,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Martin Crutsinger is the chief economics writerfor The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
