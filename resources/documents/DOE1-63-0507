While coalbeddegasification ahead of coal mining was already a reality in severalparts of the country, the APGA demonstration program was aimed at actualconsumer use of the gas. Emphasis was therefore placed on degasificationof coals with high methane gas content and on utilization of conventionaloil field techniques. 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
