CNW said the investor group-led by New York investment banking firm Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, and members of CNW's senior management -- revised its one-week-old bid for the transportation company's common shares outstanding to $31 a share, including $9 instead of $8 in subordinated debt, $20 in cash and $2 in stock of the acquiring company.    CNW has about 18.6 million common shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CNW's shares closed at $23.875, up 87.5 cents.    A CNW spokesman said the investment group decided to increase the $30-a-share bid after discussions last week with a special committee of outside CNW directors. Gibbons Green also agreed to extend the Sunday expiration date of the bid to today.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed mostly by borrowing. The debt is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of assets.    CNW is the holding company for Chicago andamp; North Western Transportation Co. and a snow plow maker. </TEXT></DOC>
