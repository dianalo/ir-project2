At a news conference at Kennedy International Airport upon hisreturn to the United States on Wednesday, the cardinal called histhree-day visit to Lebanon a success because it focused attentionon the fighting there.   He called for a Vatican-sponsored peace conference, supported bythe United States and other major powers, to end the fighting andsaid Pope John Paul II had agreed to support the idea.   O'Connor said he began receiving messages Saturday that ``somevery special circumstances'' had developed, making it clear itwould have been too dangerous for him to travel to west Beirut.   ``I was finally convinced at that point that it would not beworth the risk, especially of being taken hostage,'' he said.   O'Connor said stories in Lebanese newspapers that Moslem leaderswere angered by his decision to cancel the visit were inaccurate.   The cardinal said Selim Hoss, prime minister of the Moslemgovernment of Lebanon, had agreed he made the right decision. TheMoslem government is being challenged by a Christian cabinet.   O'Connor said he hoped the Bush administration would support aVatican-sponsored peace conference, and said Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir and Hoss had reacted favorably to the idea.   O'Connor said his unsuccessful attempt to find out where theWestern hostages are being held was one failure of the trip. Hesaid people who had provided information in the past could tell himnothing about the hostages.   ``They said it's as if they have vanished into thin air,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
