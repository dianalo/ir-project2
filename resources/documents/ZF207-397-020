Hodge, a consultant with Los Angeles-based Candle Corp., a companythat makes software to monitor computer performance.andM;Even DB2's QMF, which enables users to issue dynamic queries to the database, offers limited guarantees that a user query won't tie up much-neededresources, according to Hodge.andP;  He recalls one such query that took six daysto be answered.andP;  In part, such problems derive from the flexibility by whichinformation can be stored in DB2.andP;  A poorly constructed query can requestmore information than users really need, Hodge explains.andP;  For thoseprogrammers or end users kept waiting for a query to be processed, more isdefinitely not better.andM;&quot;DB2 has made it very easy functionally to produce systems.andP;  But if thesesystems are going into a production environment with a large number oftransactions, then you've got to look at performance,&quot; advises Arun Ghosh,division manager for data base services at Security Pacific Automation Co. ofLos Angeles.andM;The company, which provides information services to Security Pacific Bank,follows several guidelines to prevent unwieldy queries from impacting systemperformance.andP;  For instance, it constantly fine-tunes SQL statements andpushes developers to use indexes often.andP;  That's no small feat given that thebank's 20 DB2 applications employ tables with up to 10 million rows each.andM;In addition, Security Pacific uses Omegamon to monitor the efficiency of itsdata base usage.andP;  The services company was an early support program user ofDB2 Version 2.1 and has more than a year's experience with versions of therelational data base.andM;Planning is essential to running an effective relational data base managementsystem that doesn't consume CPU time or cause unacceptable surges in I/Oactivity, according to users such as Ray Stephenson, data base administratorat Sara Lee Direct, of Winston-Salem, N.C., a unit of food giant Sara LeeCorp.andM;Avoiding the Money PitandM;&quot;Unlike other data base management systems, DB2 is easy to use, highlyflexible, can eliminate your data base administrator and is able to workacross very large data bases,&quot; says Stephenson.andP;  However, he warns that apoor implementation can just as easily turn into a money pit.andP;  &quot;You have todo the same things as installing IMS [Information Management System], andyou've got to learn how to code SQL or performance will suffer.&quot;andM;Like many other DB2 licensees, Sara Lee Direct monitors all applicationsbefore they go into production.andP;  The company uses Insight/DB2 from DatabaseUtility Group of Federal Way, Wash.andP;  Such monitoring &quot;allows us to catchproblems in development before they ever impact production,&quot; Stephenson says.andM;Janet Weber, systems programmer at Monumental Life Insurance Co. ofBaltimore, says performance studies are turning up problems caused by a lackof planning.andP;  Monumental gave Weber a year to design standards, build DB2tables and design queries for end users to run against the data base.andM;For example, Weber brought in Insight/DB2 to determine the source of responsetime problems on a CICS DB2 application.andP;  After editing the requests, shelearned that a frequently used query was too vaguely structured to identifythe correct index.andP;  Each time it was made, the entire index was read, andthen every record in the data bases referenced by the indexes was also read.andM;&quot;This can't be corrected by the system alone.andP;  It needed special monitoring,&quot;says Weber.andP;  She used DB2's Explain facility, but all it told her was thatthe index was being searched, not that every page of data was being read, aswell.andM;Events that clobber response times can be controlled with IBM's QMF, a DB2option for processing interactive queries.andP;  DB2 and QMF each include aresource governor to control the amount of system resources a query or seriesof related queries can consume.andP;  When a query exceeds predetermined limits,it is automatically shut off.andM;Philip Morris USA uses that approach to save resources on a mass mobilizationsystem of names, addresses and other characteristics of people who have aninterest in the tobacco industry.andP;  At least 30 end users query the data baseusing QMF each day, says Cary Jones, a senior technical analyst for computerplanning at Philip Morris in Richmond, Va.andP;  However, not everyone considersthe governor to be helpful.andP;  Monumental Life's Weber says the QMF governorhas been used only in test environments.andM;Flood of QueriesandM;&quot;As we open the door to ad hoc [queries], we have to prepare for the waterthat rushes through,&quot; says Christopher Myers, a senior data base consultantwith Security Pacific.andP;  Myers' chief concern is that user queries do notnegatively impact bread-and-butter production systems now running at thebank.andM;While agreeing that end users should be advised that optimum ad hoc querystructures save resources, Ghosh of Security Pacific thinks proper SQLprogramming shouldn't be a user's first concern.andP;  &quot;Users should be focusingon the business.andP;  They know how the business runs and, as part of doing theirjob, they need to use the system to get at data.andM;&quot;On the other side of the coin, there are queries that will eat you alive,&quot;asserts Ghosh.andP;  As ad hoc queries have grown, Security Pacific has begun toexamine the most efficient way to process them.andP;  Under study are suchvariables as processor requirements and software and hardware alternatives.andO;&quot;We're talking very large data bases of maybe 30,40 and 50 gigabytes thatcould be [facing] very complex ad hoc queries,&quot; Ghosh adds.andM;Others are pursuing dual data base strategies to separate ad hoc queries fromtheir production applications.andP;  For instance, United Parcel Service ofParamus, N.J., is diverting ad hoc applications from its IMS data base to aDB2 data base, according to capacity planner David Feigenbaum.andP;  The companyassigns the more frequently requested data to DB2.andP;  In the face of some15,000 queries per day, the extraction method has prevented seriouscontention problems, Feigenbaum adds.andM;PCs Relieve HostandM;Offloading the mainframe is another strategy employed at Toronto-basedCentral Canada Grocers, one of a growing number of companies providing userswith PC/SQL from Micro Decisionware of Boulder, Colo.andP;  The package enablesend users to retrieve data from host data bases by means of menu-generatedSQL statements.andP;  Douglas Chmara, senior technical analyst with the company'sIS operations, says the product lets users do &quot;what if&quot; work without eatingup mainframe cycles.andM;PC/SQL is part of the concept of cooperative processing, where data can beextracted from host mainframes; it can be updated and then uploaded to thehost to populate DB2 data bases.andP;  About 100 installations now use the MicroDecisionware product; last year, the company was named an IBM authorizedapplication specialist for DB2.andM;As performance monitors proliferate, DB2 users may come to realize more fullythe promised elegance of what IBM calls the DBMS of the 1990s.andP;  &quot;We bought itbecause--like SAA and IBM's Cross System Product (CSP)--we were told it wasthe direction of the future,&quot; says Stephenson of Sara Lee Direct.andM;These performance measurements, however, may also lead users to question theadded resources DB2 requires and perhaps have second thoughts abouttrade-offs.andP;  One user says DB2 requires at least five times the systemresources of flat file-based applications.andP;  Users such as Biggers Brothers ofCharlotte, N.C., and Irving Oil in Saint John, New Brunswick--both of whichhave installed DB2 on 4381 class processors--are quickly having to move up to3090s.andM;&quot;I feel like I have a tiger by the tail,&quot; jokes Cary Jones of Philip Morris.andO;&quot;And I can't let it go.andP;  Too much is invested in it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
