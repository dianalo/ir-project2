<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0436 </DOCNO><TEXT>Often in a molten carbonate type fuel cell, the cell performance is impairedby the inbalance in the wetting of the electrode due to the electrolyte,because of localized position of electrolyte to either anode or cathodeside. In this invention, when the cell performance gets reduced, thereaction gas is either interrupted or feed amount decreased during theload is applied on the cell; this condition is maintained for a while;then returned to the original condition; by this, the cell performancecan be recovered. The interruption of the reaction gas or slow-down ofthe feed amount causes a potential change of anode or cathode, causingchanges in the state of the boundary between the electrode and the electrolyteplate, moving the electrochemical reaction field and improving the cellcharacteristics.
