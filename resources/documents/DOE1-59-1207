It is a daughter of Sr-90 (T1/2=28.6y) readily available at a reasonable cost and provides 1.99 gm-rad/{mu}Ci-hr.When chelated to a tumor targeting antibody, the product is capable ofdelivering a lethal radiation dose to tumor cells. Yttrium-90 is preferentiallyseparated from a 0.1 M HCl solution of Sr-90 by extraction into 1 M Di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid in dodecane. The Y-90 is back extractedinto 6 M HCl, Kd = 7.E-3, and decontamination levels in excess of 1.E-5are achievable with an overall chemical yield of 70%. Yttrium-90 chlorideis incubated with a tumor targeting antibody previously conjugated withDTPA to form a stable labelled complex. Following IV injection into tumorbearing animals or patients, the Y-90 complex is concentrated in thetumor relative to normal tissues. Tumor doses in excess of 2000 radshave been delivered with a single IV injection in hepatoma therapy atJohns Hopkins. A therapy planning system based on In-111 labelled antibodyimaging is under development, as are methods to improve tumor specificity.</TEXT></DOC>
