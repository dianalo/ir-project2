Due to lack of time and the urgent need to establishthe new NDB SIAP, and although this action was not preceded by notice andpublic procedure, comments are invited on the rule. When the comment periodends, the FAA will use the comments submitted, together with other availableinformation, to review the regulation. After the review, if the FAA findsthat changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings toamend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supportingthe views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluatingthe effects of the rule and determining whether additional rulemaking isneeded. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical,economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggestthe need to modify the rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule</ITAG>The purpose of this amendment to andSection; 71.181 of Part 71 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is to amend the Vero Beach, Florida,transition area. Section 71.181 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswas republished in FAA Handbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediateneed for a regulation to amend the Vero Beach, Florida, transition area.This action will provide additional controlled airspace for protectionof IFR aircraft executing a new NDB SIAP to the St. Lucie County InternationalAirport, Fort Pierce, Florida. This rule will facilitate early restorationof instrument operations at Fort Pierce, which were disrupted when theVero Beach, Florida, VORTAC was destroyed by fire in January 1989. Therefore,I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 F 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, Transition area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
