The tumor-host systemused was the solid mouse tumor sarcoma-180 growing on female albino mice(NMRI). A device was built which makes it possible to intravenously infusetumor bearing mice with solutions of /sup 125/IUdR for several weeks.Three or, respectively, 5 days before the onset of the infusions themice were inocculated into the right hind leg with 3x10/sup 5/ tumorcells in 0.1 ml physiological salt solution. The total activity administeredper mouse was 100 {mu}Ci infused during a period of 10 days. After terminationof the infusions tumor sizes and retained radioactivities were measuredevery 5 days until death of the animals occured. In comparison with tumorsof control animals tumors of mice infused with /sup 125/IUdR showed amean retardation in growth of about 27% of the volumes of control tumorsduring the total period of post-infusion observation (25 days). Extensionof life expectancy and an increase of the rate of final tumor regressiondid not occur. Likewise, no significant differences were observed betweentumors which were 3 or 5 days old on the first day of infusion. Aftertermination of the infusions the residual whole-body radioactivity permouse was about 1% of the total activity infused per animal. This wasin good agreement with calculations considering rates of incorporationand excretion and confirmed earlier assumptions that only about 5% ofthe administered IUdR is incorporated initially. The number further confirmedthat, during the first 10 days after incorporation, the daily loss ofactivity - due to cell death - is about 30%. Control animals withouttumors showed a faster decrease of incorporated activity or, respectively,loss of cells than tumor bearing mice. (Abstract Truncated)</TEXT></DOC>
