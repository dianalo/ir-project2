The calm before their return after Labor Day is a good time for President Bush and his advisers to sit back and look where they've been and where they're going. If they do, they might be struck by the continued deterioration of the presidency as an institution. It is weaker now than Mr. Bush found it eight months ago.    This observation may surprise some in the administration, which does have some good reasons to be pleased with its tenure so far. President Bush's popularity ratings are higher than Ronald Reagan's. To the amazement of many, some version of a capital-gains tax cut looks certain. For better or worse, President Bush got close to his savings-and-loan bailout plan. His partisan and institutional opposition suffered the embarrassment of Speaker Wright's resignation. Yet at the same time, Congress has asserted ever more power over the Executive Branch. With partisans like George Mitchell and Richard Gephardt asserting themselves in Congress, there's trouble ahead.    The most obvious new congressional assertion is denying Mr. Bush the right to hire his own staff. In its battles with President Reagan, Congress learned that criminalizing policy differences could topple key officials. Now the push is to start to eliminate President Bush's personnel before they take office.    Congress began this new separation-of-powers assault with John Tower. By last week, the Senate had stalled some 110 nominations to various agencies, departments and federal courts. One of the Senate's final acts last week was to &quot;return&quot; the names of three nominees. Fred Bush, picked to be ambassador to Luxembourg, was held up because he was a HUD consultant. Diane Morales was returned because Greenpeace and others oppose her for assistant energy secretary for environment, safety and health. Alan Cranston arranged for San Francisco lawyer Vaughn Walker to be kept on ice despite first being nominated as a judge by President Reagan. Contrary to the Constitution's mandate, this means the Senate neither advised nor consented, instead forcing President Bush to decide whether to resubmit the names.    Even conservatives joined the Congress vs. the President game. A group of Republican Senators forced Robert Fiske Jr. to withdraw his name for Deputy Attorney General, a key position that could well be vacant for the first quarter of the Bush term. Jesse Helms -- who should be made Secretary of State out of spite some day -- has blocked the nomination of the director general of the Foreign Service.    The liberals who trashed William Lucas also denied him his elemental and probably constitutional right to an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Even Robert Bork got that much. White House aides are downplaying the chances of a recess appointment for Mr. Lucas, but Senate Majority Leader Mitchell took the threat seriously enough to send a letter lecturing President Bush that a recess appointment &quot;would be a very unwise course of action.&quot; The letter is best taken as evidence of the wisdom of such a move. Yet it's true that President Bush has not laid the groundwork for such a step by enunciating a committed defense of his constitutional prerogatives. If he wants to reserve such options as recess appointments for future cases, he needs to start now.    Clearly Congress is girding for more battles ahead. For example, take the breathtakingly dangerous rider that Pat Moynihan tacked on to the Senate's $4.6 billion State Department authorization, criminalizing any discussions by government officials with third parties to help support &quot;any similar activities&quot; whose funding Congress has prohibited. This would violate the President's right to negotiate as he pleases with other countries. State and Justice already have urged a veto because otherwise Executive-Branch officials will be indicted as felons for engaging in routine negotiations.    President Bush did take a good first step last week in defending his constitutional rights. He invoked separation-of-powers grounds in vetoing the protectionist joint resolution demanding that he renegotiate the FSX fighter deal with Japan. His veto message warned Congress against any such measures that &quot;would tie my hands in the exercise of my constitutional responsibilities.&quot; This is precisely the correct test, but one that needs to be applied more broadly, consistently and vigorously.    The immediate task for President Bush is to get all his men and women on board. He needs all the help from them he can get not just to exercise his presidential responsibilities, but also to protect the powers of his branch from Congress. If he can turn back congressional efforts to hamstring the Executive Branch, there's no telling what other successes this success might create. </TEXT></DOC>
