It'sa question of culture.   ``He's an Arab, I'm an Afghan. He wears skirts, I wear this,'' hesaid, pointing to his loose cotton trousers and knee-length shirtcalled a shalwar kameez. ``And we are absolutely different fromIran.''   Karzai is a spokesman for the seven-party Islamic Unity of AfghanMujahedeen based in this ancient, dusty frontier city, and apolitical officer of the Afghan National Liberation Front.   The front is considered one of the more moderate,Western-oriented parties of mujahedeen, or ``holy warriors.'' Karzaiacknowledged that conservative groups have more power within thealliance and said there are differences on how to define an Islamicstate even within the Afghan context.   Shahruk Gran, a field commander of the moderate National IslamicFront of Afghanistan, said all the guerrillas are Moslems but thatdoes not mean they fit a specific political mold.   ``Some people misinterpret Islam _ some putting it on a narrowpath and some on a broader one,'' he said, ``but I think for all ofus it means having the right of choosing our own government.''   He and the other mujahedeen believe that right was usurped inApril 1978 when communists seized control of Afghanistan in amilitary coup. The insurrection began soon afterward.   More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country, most of themto Pakistan, the neighbor to the east, and the others to Iran, onAfghanistan's western border. The guerrillas use refugee camps asbases and most of their support comes from the United States andPakistan.   Soviet military forces intervened in December 1979 and anestimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were in Afghanistan when theybegan withdrawing May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement. All are tobe gone by Feb. 15.   Gran's reference to broad and narrow paths illustrates thedifference between the three moderate parties and the four groups ofhardliners who describe themselves as Islamic revolutionaries firstand Afghans second.   Among the most powerful conservative factions is theHezb-i-Islami faction led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar.   ``Our government should be one of Moslems, especially those whohave shed their blood for Allah against the foreign invaders andtheir puppets,'' he said in an interview last 1988. ``The future ofAfghanistan is for those who have fought for it and no one else.''   Pressure has been brought from outside, particularly the UnitedStates and Pakistan, for a softer position now that the Soviets areleaving and the Marxist regime in Kabul is expected to fall.   ``There is room for all of us, but under no circumstances will weaccept the communists, not after what they have done,'' said GhausAmer, a Hekmatyar spokesman in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan.   Whatever their differences, the mujahedeen factions agree theirgovernment should have friendly relations with neighbors, even theSoviet Union, but be free of foreign interference.   ``We have a 2,000-kilometer (1,200-mile) border with theRussians, so of course we want good diplomatic relations,'' Karzaisaid. ``There will be problems with trust, especially at thebeginning, but we will have to build those relations gradually.''   Strong as their desire for independence may be, the Afghans willbe heavily dependent on foreign aid to rebuild after a decade of warthat reduced many cities to rubble. Much of the industry andagriculture is idle or in ruins, and mines litter the landscape.   One-third of the prewar population lives in the refugee camps ofPakistan and Iran and must be repatriated. U.N. officials estimatereconstruction and resettlement will cost more than $2 billion.   Western diplomats in Islamabad expect most Afghans to bepreoccupied with rebuilding their lives.   One said: ``The question of government is relevant mainly to thepolitical leaders'' of the mujahedeen. ``The Afghans' tradition hasbeen to run their affairs locally with as little interference aspossible from Kabul.''</TEXT></DOC>
