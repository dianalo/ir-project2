In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, JWT rose $1.125 a share to close at $32.25.    As previously reported, JWT Chairman Don Johnston fired his heir apparent Friday after the executive presented what the company described as a leveraged buyout proposal from Claremont Group Ltd., a New York-based investment banking firm. Company sources said the future of two other top executives who also may have been involved with the proposal still is undecided.    Wall Street and industry sources said that eight or more groups are considering making offers for control of part or all of JWT. JWT's Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc. public relations unit has received at least two overtures.    &quot;I know of six investment companies that are keenly interested in (JWT),&quot; said Oscar Lubow, a principal with Alger Place Fund Inc., a closely held merchant banker in Larchmont, N.Y., that is familiar with ad agencies. He added, however, that none of the groups would consider making an unfriendly offer for JWT. He declined to identify the groups, which he said had been interested in JWT even before the Friday buyout proposal was disclosed.    Some analysts, however, aren't convinced that a takeover will occur, despite the interest in JWT, whose advertising clients include International Business Machines Corp. and Burger King Corp., a Pillsbury Co. unit. Moreover, industry executives point out that it is difficult to engineer a hostile takeover of an ad agency because if top executives are forced out, their clients may follow.    &quot;It's pretty clear that in this case the board sided decisively and immediately&quot; with Mr. Johnston, noted James Dougherty, an analyst with County Securities USA. &quot;My guess is the next overture would be treated the same way.&quot;    Mr. Dougherty added that he lowered his JWT earnings estimate for 1986 to $1 or less a share from $1.25 a share, compared with $2 a share in 1985, after he said the company indicated to him that there may be a fourth-quarter loss. JWT couldn't be reached to comment on its fourth-quarter results.    Wall Street sources said Claremont Group may make another proposal to the company. Claremont refused to comment on its intentions.    Claremont President John Cirigliano did say, however, that JWT's characterization of its Friday proposal as a &quot;leveraged buyout&quot; was incorrect. He said Claremont had suggested exploring a recapitalization of the company with &quot;a substantial amount of employee ownership through an ESOP,&quot; or employee stock ownership plan. Under such a proposal, employees, using retirement or other benefit plans to buy stock, would end up with a majority vote in the company.    Before making its approach to JWT, Claremont's most recent activity was an unsuccessful bid last month for Rochester, N.Y.-based Champion Products Inc., a maker of athletic and leisure wear.    A JWT spokesman said &quot;the organization is solidly behind&quot; Mr. Johnston, who also is the company's chief executive officer. Mr. Johnston fired Joseph W. O'Donnell, who was chairman and chief executive of JWT's J. Walter Thompson Co. unit, after the executive presented the Claremont proposal. Mr. O'Donnell also had suggested that Mr. Johnston relinquish his chief executive title and turn over day-to-day operating responsibilities to the unit.    But some industry executives were critical of Mr. Johnston's handling of the situation. &quot;It shows the insecurity of the man at the top,&quot; said Stephen Kahler, a Darien, Conn., consultant and former ad agency executive. Other executives, however, criticized Mr. O'Donnell for bringing the proposal before the board before lining up support from directors. Mr. Johnston couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. O'Donnell declined to comment.    The JWT spokesman said that Mr. Johnston met with Victor S. Gutierrez, J. Walter Thompson's chief financial officer, yesterday morning, and that company officials will be in contact with John E. Peters, chief operating officer, later this week. Mr. Johnston is trying to determine if the men, who couldn't be reached for comment, played a role in supporting Mr. O'Donnell. &quot;The fact that Vic hasn't left shows that it was a cordial meeting and that Don heard what he wanted to hear,&quot; the spokesman said.    Wall Street sources said investment groups interested in making an offer for JWT likely would approach some of the top executives who have left the company recently, including Mr. O'Donnell. </TEXT></DOC>
