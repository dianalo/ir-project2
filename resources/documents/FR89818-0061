As a result of Order Nos. 436 and 500 and Transco'stransition toward an unbundled, open access pipeline environment, manyof Transco's customers have permanently converted a portion of their firmsales entitlements to firm transportation entitlements, and Transco agreedto limited modifications of the GSS, LSS and LG-A tariff restrictions toenable customers to inject into storage limited quantities of gas purchasedfrom third parties. Transco states that the current entitlement to injectthird-party gas into storage is not in all instances equivalent on a percentagebasis to the percentage converted to firm transportation service. Transcoexplains that if the permanent conversion from sales to transportationoccurred on or before May 1, 1988, injection quantities purchased fromthird parties are limited, on a daily and total quantity basis, to a quantityequal to the customer's injection entitlement (daily and total) multipliedby the percentage of the customer's daily firm purchase entitlement whichhas been converted to firm transportation service. It is further explained,for conversions taking place after May 1, 1988, the customer's injectionrights for third-party gas are further limited on both a daily and totalquantity basis so as not to exceed 15% of the customer's storage injectionentitlements. Transco explains that Under Rate Schedule S-2, customerscurrently are not permitted to return to storage quantities of gas purchasedfrom third-party sellers.Transco proposes to modify the services it currently renders pursuant tothe Schedules GSS, LSS, LG-A and S-2 to permit customers unlimited rightto inject into storage (or ``return'' to Transco for storage), on a dailyand total quantity basis, quantities of gas purchased from third partiesequivalent on a percentage basis to the level which each customer has converted,either on an interim or permanent basis, from firm sales service to firmtransportation service. Transco explains that under the Revised Stipulationand Agreement customers are permitted to convert up to 100 percent firmsales service to firm transportation service on an interim basis_from thedate the Commission approves the Stipulation and Agreement through March31, 1991, with a possible one year extension. Transco proposes for theinterim period, to remove all limitations on the injection into storage(or ``return'' to storage) of third-party gas under Rate Schedules GSS,LSS, LG-A and S-2.Transco states that under Rate Schedule S-2, during the November 16 toApril 15 period, customers would designate to Transco that portion of withdrawalquantities (consistent with conversion percentages) which would be purchasedfrom Transco under Rate Schedule CD and that portion of such quantitieswhich would be returned to Transco from quantities of gas purchased underthird-party transportation arrangements, including purchases under Transco'sRate Schedule IFS. Transco explains that in regard to withdrawal quantitieswhich a customer designates would be returned under third-party arrangements(non Rate Schedule CD), at the time of withdrawal the customer would payonly the applicable delivered from storage charge. Transco further explainsthat when the customer returns gas purchased from third-party sources,Transco would charge the applicable rate under its Rate Schedule IT ofFT, as applicable, for transportation of the gas on Transco's system forredelivery to Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation under Rate ScheduleX-28 plus the return to seller charge. <T3>Comment date:</T3> August 15, 1989 in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of the notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">4.

Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP89-1883-000an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permissionand approval to abandon the Stratton Pipeline System (Stratton System)and a petition for a declaratory order which disclaims jurisdiction overthe abandoned facilities, all as more fully set forth in the applicationand petition which are on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.Tennessee states that it has entered into an Option and Agreement of Salewith Union Pacific Resources Company (UPRC) which provides, <T3>inter alia</T3>, for the conveyance by Tennessee to UPRC of the StrattonSystem. Upon receipt of the authorization requested herein, Tennessee aversit will convey such facilities to UPRC, and UPRC will continue to operatethe facilities in order to deliver gas into Tennessee's interstate pipelinesystem at Tennessee's Meter No. 1-0008. Therefore, Tennessee requests,on behalf of UPRC, that the Commission confirm that the Stratton Systemfor which abandonment is sought herein by Tennessee will be a non-jurisdictionalgathering facility when owned and operated by UPRC.It is stated that the facilities which are subject to this applicationand petition for declaratory order are located behind processing plantsor serve to deliver gas to a central point in the field at a pipeline interconnection.According to Tennessee, the primary function of these facilities is gatheringgas to the plant for processing and delivery and/or delivering the gasinto the mainlines of Tennessee and United. As such, Tennessee states thatthe realignment of the facilities when two plants were shut down for economic/operationalreasons did not modify the primary function of the subject facilities whichremains gathering.Tennessee describes states that the Stratton System as follows:Agua Dulce-Wardner Line 1B-100(1) Approximately 4.65 miles of 18-inch pipeline beginning at an 18-inchweld ell which adjoins piping on the upstream side of the Champlain WardnerCoastal Meter Station \1\<NOTE/> as detailed on Drawing TO-C1-E1-YA-102 located in the AndresDe La Fuente Survey A-111 and being situated on Tennessee fee lands.

Thence proceeding in asoutheasterly direction to a point of termination at the Coastal Plant,which is no longer operative, and being situated in the Andres De La FuenteSurvey A-111.It is stated that the Stratton System includes all additions or modificationsthereto which are used with, useful to, or required for the operation thereof.Tennessee states that the Stratton System is located near its CompressorStation No. 1 in San Patricio County, Texas and consists of three segmentsof pipeline. The Agua Dulce-Wardner line (4.65 miles of 18-inch and 3.06miles of 12-inch pipeline) extended from the discharge side of the WardnerStation Processing Plant to an interconnection with Tennessee's original24-inch main line. The Agua Dulce-Wardner-Gulf Plains lateral (0.51 mileof 10-inch pipeline) extended from the discharge side of the Gulf PlainsProcessing Plant to an interconnection with the Agua Dulce-Wardner line.The Coastal line (0.43 mile of 10-inch pipeline) extended from the dischargeside of the Coastal Station processing Plant to an interconnection withthe Agua Dulce-Wardner line near Tennessee's Meter No. 1-0008. Tennesseestates that, today, only the Gulf Plains Plant remains in operation.According the Tennessee, the Stratton System was constructed by Tennesseein 1944 (Docket No. G-230, 3 FPC 574), and has been fully depreciated forboth book and tax purposes.Tennessee avers that the three segments of the Stratton System were originallyinstalled for the receipt and transportation of gas produced in the Stratton-AguaDulce field. The gas was either purchased by Tennessee from the ChicagoCorporation (Chicago), predecessor of UPRC, or delivered to Tennessee fortransportation for the account of The Manufacturers Light and Heat Company(Manufacturers), predecessor of Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia),all as provided by an agreement between Tennessee and Chicago dated September7, 1943. The gas to be transported by Tennessee for Manufacturers was soldby Chicago to Manufacturers. It is stated that the September 7, 1943, contractprovided that the point of delivery to Tennessee for both gas sold by Chicagoto Tennessee and gas sold by Chicago to Manufacturers would be at a pointon Tennessee's system in the Agua Dulce field. Tennessee states that uponconstruction of its system, the point of delivery was established at thedischarge side of each of the three then existing processing plants.Tennessee states that the September 7, 1943, contract was superseded bya contract between Tennessee and Chicago dated August 15, 1952 (UPRC'sFERC Gas Rate Schedule No. 5). Tennessee adds that by an amendment datedMay 30, 1953, the parties agreed that the point of delivery for gas tobe purchased by Tennessee was to be at the discharge side of Chicago'sWardner Coastal Meter Station (Tennessee's Meter No. 1-0008). Further,it is stated that pursuant to the May 30, 1953, agreement, although Tennesseeretained ownership of the lines, Chicago assumed all responsibility inconnection with the maintenance and operation of the Stratton System.Tennessee further states that its Meter No. 1-0008 has also been establishedas the delivery point to Tennessee of gas purchased by Columbia from UPRCand delivered to Tennessee for transportation for Columbia's account.It is stated that Tennessee has entered into other obligations to receivegas at its Meter No. 1-0008, however, Tennessee has no obligation to receiveor deliver gas at any point on the Stratton System other than at Tennessee'sMeter No. 1-0008. Therefore, Tennessee states, the facilities proposedto be abandoned are not necessary for Tennessee's continued receipt ofgas under any gas purchase agreement or any gas transportation agreement.According to Tennessee, the Wardner and Coastal Plants ceased to operatein 1952, and operation of the Stratton System has evolved in a manner sothat it is utilized as a production and gathering facility. By conveyingthe Stratton System to UPRC, Tennessee adds, it will maintain the samegas supply dedication and the same transportation abilities while eliminatingall expenses of maintenance of such system. Accordingly, Tennessee statesthat such reduction will generate savings to Tennessee's customers. Inaddition, Tennessee avers that conveyance of such properties to UPRC anddecertification of this system will permit flexibility in operations whichwill enhance UPRC's ability to carry out its production and gathering operationsin the Agua Dulce and other nearby fields.<T3>Comment date:</T3> September 1, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">18.
