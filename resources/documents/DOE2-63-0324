We have combined a microfocal X-raygenerator with a multistep avalanche/multiwire proportional counter toproduce a digital X-ray microscope. Spatial resolution down to around10 {mu}m has been observed. The digital data sets obtained from the systemhave been used to develop and explore 3-D tomographic reconstructiontechniques.</TEXT></DOC>
