The 87-year-old emperor has been bedridden with internalhemorrhaging since Sept. 19, and his death would lead to a furtherclosing of the stock market.   Another dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo said tradingremained inactive in the afternoon as a majority of institutionalinvestors remained on the sidelines.   It was mostly individual investors' buy orders for steel,shipbuilding and financial issues that boosted the Nikkei index, hesaid, speaking on condition of anonymity.
