On August 16, 1989, the Commission released a <T3>Third Further Notice of Inquiry and Notice of Proposed Rule Making(``Third Further Notice'') </T3>in the above-captioned proceeding, solicitingcomment on an additional proposal for determining how an incumbent licenseemay obtain a renewal expectancy in a comparative renewal hearing.\1\<NOTE/> The Commission proposes to continue to award a renewal expectancybased upon an incumbent licensee's past meritorious service, but adopta new order of proof to apply this standard. The deadlines for filing commentsand reply comments in response to the <T3>Third Further Notice </T3>are currently October 10, 1989, and October25, 1989, respectively. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 4 FCC Rcd 6363 (1989), <T3>summarized </T3>at 54 Fed. Reg. 35357 (Aug. 25, 1989). 2. On September 25, 1989, a motion for extension of time for filing commentsand reply comments was filed by the National Association of Broadcasters(``NAB''). The motion requests that the deadline for filing comments beextended by 30 days to November 9, 1989, and that the deadline for filingreplies be extended by 37 days to December 1, 1989.3. NAB contends that the extension of time is necessary because of thecomplexity and importance of the issues raised in the <T3>Third Further Notice.</T3> It notes that the <T3>Third Further Notice </T3>raises questions such as the workabilityof the proposal, its consistency with the Communications Act, and its compatibilitywith other renewal expectancy reforms proposed in this proceeding. NABbelieves that such an analysis requires an in-depth consideration of themany facets of this proceeding, taken as a whole, and thus necessitatesa greater amount of time to prepare comments than has been provided. NABalleges that, by granting the requested extension, the Commission willfacilitate commenters in making a thorough analysis, thereby resultingin the development of a more complete and accurate record in this proceeding.4. Although andSection; 1.46(a) of the Commission's Rules provides that extensionsof time should not be routinely granted, we believe that, in this case,NAB has presented valid reasons for granting the requested extensions.In particular, we agree that it is of the utmost importance to developa complete record on the question of how to award renewal expectanciesin comparative renewal hearings. Indeed, even after proffering furtherproposals in the <T3>Second Further Notice of Inquiry and Notice of Proposed Rule Making</T3>(53 FR 31894, August 22, 1988) and considering the comments filedin response thereto, we determined that further study was necessary.\2\<NOTE/> We also acknowledge that devising a meaningful renewal expectancystandard and method for applying it is a complex and difficult task. Giventhe importance of this issue, we believe that an additional amount of timeto respond to the latest proposal is warranted. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See Third Further Notice, </T3>4 FCC Rcd at 6364-65.5. Accordingly, <T3>It is ordered, </T3>That the motion for extension of time filed bythe National Association of Broadcasters IS GRANTED and that the time forfiling comments and reply comments in BC Docket No. 81-742 IS HEREBY EXTENDEDto November 9, 1989, and December 1, 1989, respectively. 6.
