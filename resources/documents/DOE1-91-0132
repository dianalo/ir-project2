<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0132 </DOCNO><TEXT>Results of development and testing of high voltage pulse system HVPS forthe streamer chamber supply of the GIBS spectrometer are presented. HVPSconsists of the following basic blocks: nanosecond pulse high voltagegenerator, high voltage charging supply, trigger generator, chamber parametercontrol devices, gas-oil vacuuming supply systems, auxiliary and fire-preventiondevices. The system blocks are described. Experimental results of HVPCtesting are presented. HVPC provides a reliable (10/sup 5/ operations)of streamer chamber supply with high voltage pulse parameters: amplitude- 500 kV, amplitude instability (0.5-1.5)%, pulse duration - 12 ns, delaytime - 500 ns, delay instability (2.5-5)%, mean frequency of output asignals - 0.1 Hz. 7 refs.; 5 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
