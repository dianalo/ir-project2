It was very difficult to see it&quot; among the brush on themountainside, Allen said at a news conference.;   The RH-53D left AlamedaNaval Air Station for North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego Nov. 17 on aroutine flight to pick up equipment and passengers. The crew and helicopterbelonged to Mine Countermeasures Squadron 19.;   Allen said the crash site wasnot along the normal flight pattern, which follows the coastline over theocean. But he said it was not unusually far off course, just a few milesinland.;   &quot;To be quite frank we have no idea at this time . . . why they werewhere they were,&quot; Allen said.;   Authorities have not ruled out bad weather asthe cause of the crash, Allen said. There were clouds and intermittent rainduring the scheduled flight time, he said.;   The investigation at the crashsite was expected to last at least another week.;   The three crew memberswere carrying personal emergency radios, but there was no indication that anyof them tried to activate the radios, said Capt. Larry Duncan, commandingofficer of the Naval reserves at Alameda.;   Neither did the crew send manualradio signals to indicate they were having flight trouble, he said.;   TheRH-53D is not equipped with an emergency beacon because it is used for warpurposes and, if shot down, could be located by enemy forces, Duncan said.;  He said money hasn't been budgeted to install beacons in the RH-53Ds forpeacetime maneuvers.;   The three crewmen killed were Petty Officer 2nd ClassKevin Andrew Johnson, 25, of Walnut Creek; Lt.
