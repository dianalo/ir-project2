Sharon, now trade minister, has been challenging Shamir'sleadership of the right-wing Likud bloc. He renewed attacksThursday on the prime minister's peace plan, demanding the Cabinetfocus on crushing the 19-month-old Palestinian rebellion instead ofdebating the language of peace proposals.   The former general said on army radio: ``No personal attacks orthreats to fire me will keep me from demanding an end to the murderof Jews in the land of Israel.''   Arab reporters said Israeli soldiers fatally shot Tarik HusseinImram, 17, in the neck during a confrontation in Burin village nearNablus in the West Bank. They said a 20-year-old Palestinian waswounded in the leg.   In its confirmation, the army said one young man was killed andanother wounded during a search-and-arrest operation.   Twenty Palestinians were wounded in confrontations withstone-throwing protesters in half a dozen other towns and refugeecamps in the occupied lands, Arab reporters said.   At least 572 Palestinians have been killed since the rebellionbegan Dec. 8, 1987, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israelcaptured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. Thirty-sevenIsraelis have been slain.   Palestinians stayed home from work Thursday and closed theirshops as part of a general strike to express rejection of Shamir'sproposal for elections in the territories for Palestinian delegatesto talk peace with Israel.   About 250 Palestinian lawyers in the West Bank began amonth-long boycott of Israeli military courts to protest what theydescribe as the army's failure to notify family members and lawyerspromptly about arrests.   Brig. Gen. Amnon Strauschnow acknowledged in a recent interviewthere had been some delays, which he attributed the bureaucracy,but said the army had doubled its legal staff to clear up a casebacklog and end confusion.   In the Nablus military court, the trial of three Arab shepherdson charges of killing Frederick Steven Rosenfeld, a U.S.-bornIsraeli, a month ago opened began without their lawyer.   Jews stoned Arab-owned cars in Jerusalem and three Arabmotorists were injured, Israel radio reported. It said one washospitalized.   Police detained Rabbi Meir Peretz of Kiryat Arba, a Jewishsettlement near Hebron in the West Bank, on suspicion of damagingArab houses in Halhoul three weeks ago, the radio said.   Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Shamir, confirmed the primeminister had received a letter from President Bush condemning thebuilding of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, where70,000 settlers live among 1.7 million Palestinians.   He described the letter as ``friendly, most positive,'' however,and said it expressed support for the peace initiative.   Ahimeir would not comment on reports in two major newspapers,the liberal Haaretz and the independent Yediot Ahronot, that Shamirwas considering dismissing Sharon.   Shamir's anger erupted in a closed meeting Wednesday of Likudministers, where Sharon criticized the premier for not disclosingdetails of his talks with Palestinians about election arrangements.   Newspapers quoted this exchange:   ``I cannot tell you anything; you leak everything you get yourhands on,'' Shamir responded, and accused Sharon of ``sowing badblood and hatred among us.''   Sharon said, ``I can only laugh at your words. I have contemptfor what you say,'' and Shamir replied: ``He who laughs last laughsbest, and I don't want to speak to you.''   Several newspapers interpreted Shamir's words as a threat tofire Sharon. Yediot Ahronot said the prime minister's allies inLikud were urging him to do so.   Ahimeir suggested, however, that Shamir wanted to avoid a split.   ``The prime minister is concerned about the unity of theLikud,'' the spokesman said. ``He has a high tolerance thresholdand tries to see things in their broadest sense.''   Sharon, who won fame as an anti-guerrilla fighter and thegeneral who saved Israel from defeat in the 1973 Middle East war,favors tougher measures against the Palestinian uprising.   His popularity has grown because of such events as the July 6bus crash, when a Palestinian forced an Israeli bus off a highwayinto a ravine, killing 16 Jews and injuring 25 others.   Sharon's most convincing show of power came at a meeting of theLikud's governing committee July 5, when he succeeded in gettingharsh conditions attached to the peace plan.   The conditions demand that the uprising end before elections areheld, provide for continued buiding of settlements, prohibitresidents of Arab east Jerusalem from voting in the elections andreject Palestinian statehood.   Likud's acceptance of the conditions prompted a threat from theLabor Party to leave the coalition government and force earlyelections. Labor's governing committee is scheduled to meet on theissue Aug. 9.</TEXT></DOC>
