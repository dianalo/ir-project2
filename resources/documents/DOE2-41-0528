In this invention, a porous matrix layer andan electrode layer are integratedly formed via an intermediate layerwherein the deposited slurry continuously changes from electrode materialto matrix substance in a blending tank; therefore, these two phases realizea highly reliable junction, thus increasing the mechanical strength ofthe matrix which reduces the number of break during an operation andenhances the productivity of the cell. Performance and durability ofthe cell also improved. Laminating substance in the production unit istwo-fold, a nickel powder and a gamma-lithium-aluminate powder. Combustiblesubstance is a wood pulp.
