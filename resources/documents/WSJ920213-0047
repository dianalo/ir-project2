The announcement underscores the uncertainty that hassurrounded the company founded by supercomputer pioneerSeymour Cray. &quot;While Cray Computer has been raising a numberof red flags in recent months, the flags keep getting alittle bigger,&quot; said Gary Smaby, a computer consultant.</LP><TEXT>   In December, the company's only customer, the LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory, canceled its order for the $30million Cray-3 because of development delays. The companysaid at the time that it had other prospects.   Yesterday, however, the company said that 1992 marketopportunities didn't appear sufficient to warrant the risk ofincreasing spending to build a full-scale machine, whichwould be powered by 16 processors. Instead, Cray will try tosell four and eight-processor versions as well.   Cray stressed that it won't attempt to sell and supportsmaller systems in higher volumes, which prompted Barry F.Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., to callthis a &quot;bridge strategy.&quot; He said it appeared the company waslooking to generate some cash and get the computer in use,both to prove its capabilities and to create some potentialcustomers for larger systems. He also suggested that thecompany might be seeking to temporarily satisfy customers ofMr. Cray's Cray-2 machine, developed while he was at CrayResearch, while it seeks to leapfrog to the more advancedCray-4. &quot;It's already clear they've done some work on theCray-4,&quot; he said. &quot;The longer the development cycle for theCray-3 gets stretched out, the more limited the marketopportunity will be.&quot;   In its announcement, the Colorado Springs, Colo., companysaid it is still planning to test the next prototype versionof the Cray-3 before the end of March. That version, thecompany said, is expected to include solutions to thetechnical problems the company identified in December,problems that led to the cancellation of the Livermore order.   The company said it will seek a partner &quot;for the purposeof expanding the prospects for the sale of smallerconfigurations.&quot; Neil Davenport, president and chiefexecutive officer of Cray Computer, said he didn't knowwhether such a partnership is possible or what form it wouldtake. The company is looking for a partner that couldcomplement its technology with marketing, manufacturing,software or financing capabilities.   But, said Mr. Smaby, &quot;most of the dance partners have beenselected&quot; in the supercomputer arena.   Cray Computer officials didn't return calls seekingfurther comment.   The announcement dealt another blow to Cray Computer'sstumbling stock. The stock fell $1.875 to $7.25 in nationalover-the-counter trading yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
