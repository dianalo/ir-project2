Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson leaves the Air Force and the Star Warsprogram scarred from his battles with critics but still deeplycommitted to building defenses against nuclear missiles.   That goal has changed substantially, however, since PresidentReagan called in March 1983 for the development of a space-basedballistic missile defense system. That speech, Abrahamson said in afarewell interview, ``touched off a very significant debate on ourdeterrence policy.''   The debate, on the possibility of switching from a purelyoffensive nuclear deterrence to a mixture of offensive and defensivesystems, continued last week during Senate confirmation hearings forDefense Secretary-designate John G. Tower.   Tower noted that aides to President Bush are reviewing allstrategic weapons and told the Senate Armed Services Committee hepersonally does not ``believe that we can devise an ... umbrellathat can protect the entire American population from nuclearincineration. I think that's unrealistic.''   One member of the panel, Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., noted thatTower's account ``represents a view markedly different from thepublic's perception of President Reagan's advocacy of a perfectdefensive umbrella.''   Tower's remarks did reflect a vision of strategic defense thatAbrahamson has been advocating for several years.   ``What we are adding ... is an improved form of deterrence,''Abrahamson said in the interview. No strategic defense, he added,can provide an impermeable shield against a nuclear barrage.   ``The president gave us a daunting goal, to make it thoroughlyreliable,'' said Abrahamson. ``That means, let's reexamine thestrategy.''   Abrahamson's defense of SDI earned him a lot of enemies, and hegives himself ``the worse grades'' in garnering support for theprogram.   ``I have gotten a lot of scars ...,'' said Abrahamson, who willbe replaced by another three-star Air Force general, George L.Monahan Jr.   Abrahamson was considered for energy secretary under Bush, andhas been mentioned as a possible head of the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration. But so far his retirement plans includeonly windsurfing. ``I love it,'' he said.   SDI, which Abrahamson has headed since its start in April 1984,has spent $16 billion on research. Recently, scientists have beenconcentrating on less exotic weapons for the near term.   For instance, an early system might use land-based missiles,similar to the 100-missile system the Soviets have around Moscow.That is the limit set by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   Abrahamson listed these other upcoming tests:   _The $130 million Delta Star or Delta 183 test of a forerunner ofthe Boost Surveillance Tracking Satellite, to be launched ``sometimethis year,'' using infrared, ultraviolet and visible waves to spotboosters.   _A $520 million Airborne Optical Adjunct, a Boeing 767 fittedwith an 86-foot cupola containing an infrared sensor designed tospot warheads as they reenter the atmosphere.   _Forerunners of the High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor, tobe tested this year, and the Exoatmospheric Interceptor System, tobe tested in 1990. Both are missile systems designed to hit warheadsas they near targets.   _The first test in space of a particle beam, part of the $45million Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket, a 1.25-ton acceleratordesigned to shoot particles so that scientists can study theirbehavior in space. Researchers believe particle beams can be used todiscriminate warheads from decoys in space, and that higher-powerbeams may ultimately be able to destroy missiles in flight.   _A relay mirror experiment in which ground stations will bouncelaser beams off a satellite with a two-foot diameter that issupposed to reflect them to a point 12 miles from the point oforigin. One SDI plan calls for ``battle mirrors'' to reflectpowerful laser beams at enemy rockets.</TEXT></DOC>
