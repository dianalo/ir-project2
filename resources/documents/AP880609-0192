The bill, totalling $92 million less than President Reaganrequested, is noteworthy because it contains no money for newconstruction starts by the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau ofReclamation.   The no-new-starts posture is identical to the stand taken by theHouse last month when it approved its energy and waterappropriations bill for the year starting Oct. 1.   Hundreds of dams, harbor improvements and irrigation systemswould continue to get money for operation and maintenance and workwould continue on dozens now under construction.   The Senate and House bills would also apply the no-startsstricture to the superconducting super collider, the hugehigh-energy physics installation that would enable scientists todelve deeper into the nature of matter.   Both bills would provide $100 million to continue preliminaryresearch for the SSC, but they would bar the start of constructionon the multi-billion dollar project in fiscal 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
