One utility said the industry can easily meet the extra demandthe forecaster sees and avoid brownouts by contracting withindependent producers for power. But another company said it wouldbe foolish to rely on such a strategy.   The two views were presented at a forum for reporters sponsoredby Americans for Energy Independence, a group of energy companiesand supporters.   Already there have been predictions of brownouts by industrygroups in the Pennsylvania-Maryland-New Jersey area this summer.New York's Long Island could see similar brownouts now that thestate and Long Island Lighting Co. have agreed not to open the800-megawatt Shoreham nuclear plant.   The forecaster, John Siegel of the U.S. Council for EnergyAwareness, a nuclear industry group, said electricity demand wouldgrow 4 percent this year as manufacturing continues its export-ledboom, 4 percent again next year and in 1990 before falling back to2 percent annual growth. Growth last year was 4.5 percent.   The Energy Department originally projected 2 percent growth lastyear, and in April forecast 2 percent and 2.1 percent growth forthis year and next.   John D. Pearson, director of energy analysis and forecasting forthe department, said the department had assumed a slowdown ineconomic growth this year which isn't going to happen.   Pearson commented on Siegel's remarks: ``He has a point,especially in regard to manufacturing. We're going to take a lookat this (for the July forecast).   ``But 4 percent? He's off his gourd. We may go up, but I don'tsee going above 2{ or 3 percent.''   In the 1990s, the nation will need to add 135,000 to 210,000megawatts of generating capacity, Siegel said. Current capacity isabout 680,000 megawatts, and 11,500 megawatts are scheduled to beinstalled this year and next.   The Energy Department earlier this year said the most likelyneed in the 1990s is for 55,000 additional megawatts starting in1992.   ``I don't think the number is all that crucial,'' said WilliamW. Berry, chief executive officer of Dominion Resources Inc.,parent company of Virginia Electric Power Co.   ``The question is, where is that going to come from? First, notmuch is going to come from utility construction. Second, as much asneeded (will come) from the competitive sector.''   ``It can be built in time, provided we don't study it for thenext two years,'' Berry added.   Bruce Beam, Washington representative of American Electric PowerCo., the nation's largest private utility, noted that AEP was``vocally against'' efforts by the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission to encourage independent producers.   Beam said AEP would be ``very much in favor'' of Berry'sstrategy if regulators ``could relieve the electric utilityindustry of its obligation to serve'' all who want to be customers.</TEXT></DOC>
