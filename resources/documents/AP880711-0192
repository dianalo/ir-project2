(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Under the sunlit arch of a plasticgreenhouse, an artificial swamp of cattails and elephant grasssprouts from hydroponic troughs, soaking sustenance from a city'ssewage.   This could be the waste treatment plant of the future.   Picture it: A natural system that uses microbes and marsh plantsto transform raw sewage into sparkling clean water. Unlikeconventional sewage facilities, which cost a fortune to run, thisone makes money. It leaves no nasty sludge. It creates energy. It'sso pretty it can be used as a park.   It sounds too good to be true.   But it's already becoming a reality. Simple plant-based sewagetreatment systems are being used on a small scale in parts of theSouth. And researchers are developing more refined and efficientsystems they say could replace aging and inefficient conventionalplants on a large scale within the next decade.   ``We're looking at a whole new generation of waste treatmentthat's cheaper and much more efficient than anything that'savailable now, and produces useful resources,'' said WilliamJewell, a Cornell University agricultural engineer.   ``Our goal is to eliminate pollution at a profit,'' Jewell said.   Beside Ithaca's new $40 million conventional treatment plant,which settles, aerates and chemically treats about 5 milliongallons a day, he has set up a pilot model of his system with thecapacity to purify 10,000 gallons of sewage a day _ about what 100people would produce.   The demonstration is funded by the state energy office and theGas Research Institute, a utility-sponsored group trying to findnew sources of natural gas.   ``It's leaps and bounds ahead of anything that's been donebefore, both in terms of energy used and quality of waterdischarged,'' said Ron Isaacson, manager of renewable resources forthe Chicago-based institute.   In Jewell's two-step system, raw sewage is partially cleaned ina tankful of bacteria, then piped into long, low troughs in agreenhouse, where it provides a ``nutrient film'' on which plantsthrive.   The plants are grown hydroponically _ with no soil. Their rootsform a dense mat as they soak up the pollutants.   ``It's really a solar-powered filter,'' Jewell said on a recenttour.   In the first 4-foot-wide tank of cattails, the water is murkyand smelly. By the time it reaches the end of the 250-foot-longseries of tanks, in a few hours, it's clear as a brook and teemingwith tiny snails and other creatures.   ``These are copepods,'' said Jewell, scooping up a few flitting,flea-size crustaceans. ``Whenever you see them, you havetremendously clean water, like in a stream.''   To make the water safe to drink, however, would take furthertreatment that could be done with a more extensive outdoorhydroponic system, which he plans to build this fall, or with aconventional filtration and chlorination plant.   A bonus to plant-based sewage treatment is that methane, sold asnatural gas, is produced by the first-stage bacterial process. Morecan be made by harvesting the plants and processing them using thesame bacteria.   Jewell figures a plant with the capacity to handle the sewage of10,000 people, about a third the population of Ithaca, couldgenerate $400,000 worth of methane a year. The system could also beused to grow flowers and tree seedlings for city parks orcommercial nurseries.   But even without those products, Jewell said, his system wouldcost far less to build and operate than the plants now in use. Heestimates that for a community of 10,000, his system would costless than $1 million to build, compared to at least $5 million fora conventional plant.   ``And the quality of water produced by our system far exceedsthat achieved by conventional facilities,'' said Jewell.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has sponsoredpioneering plant-based waste treatment projects in towns inCalifornia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.   ``These are the wastewater treatment system of the future forsmall towns, especially since the federal grant money for sewagetreatment has dried up in the last few years,'' said B.C.Wolverton, at NASA's National Space Technology Laboratory in BaySt. Louis, Miss.   Wolverton's artificial marshes, which use floating plants likewater hyacinths or rooted ones like bulrushes, have treated all thechemical waste and sewage from the NASA lab for more than 12 years.``We've saved many millions of dollars by using these systems.''   Some towns are using Wolverton's sewage marshes as parks, hesaid. ``The settling tanks are underground, and they're growingcanna lilies and calla lilies in the channels.''   Most of the systems that Wolverton has designed are for towns offewer than 3,000 people. But an experimental system in operation inSan Diego, using water hyacinths to make potable water from sewage,is expected to eventually handle a million gallons a day, he said.   ``There's a desperate need to come up with a new source of waterin the Southwest,'' said Wolverton. ``This could be an answer.''   Jewell's system in central New York differs in several ways fromWolverton's. For one thing, it uses greenhouses and hardy plants,making it feasible for use in northern climes.   ``A main drawback to plant-based systems has been the climatelimitation,'' said Jim Basilico, chief of the water and pesticideresearch division of the Environmental Protection Agency, whichfunded early stages of Jewell's project. ``But if it works inIthaca, it can work anywhere.''   Another advantage of Jewell's system is that because of the typeof bacteria it uses it doesn't produce sludge like other hydroponicsystems and conventional plants do. In most systems, organicpollutants are broken down by aerobic bacteria, which need oxygen.It costs the nation half a billion dollars a year in electricity tofill that oxygen need by aerating sewage, said Jewell.   ``We spend $200 million in New York state alone just to blowbubbles through settling tanks,'' he said. ``The anaerobicalternative doesn't use any energy at all. Instead, it producesenergy.''   Because they are far more efficient at digesting waste matter,turning 90 percent of it into methane, anaerobes don't producesludge like the fast-growing and inefficient aerobic bacteria do.   ``I've begun to look at methane production as almost a magicprocess,'' said Jewell, who is also developing digesters to makemethane from garbage, agricultural wastes and crops like sorghum.   Other researchers also are looking into systems that useanaerobic bacteria to turn pollutants into profitable products.   Peter Benson, who developed the Gas Research Institute'smethane-from-biomass program, has started a venture calledRenewable Energy Systems, Inc., in Palos Park, Ill. He plans tosell a system that uses anaerobic bacteria to digest municipalgarbage as an alternative to incinerators or landfills.   ``The toughest nut to crack is inertia,'' Isaacson said. ``Itwill just take a few successful demonstrations in a real-worldsituation to prove it works and make people comfortable with it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 14</NOTE></DOC>
