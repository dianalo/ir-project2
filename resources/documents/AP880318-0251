Nicaragua claimed the sending of U.S. troops to Hondurassignaled a plot for direct U.S. military action against Nicaragua.   Nicaraguan envoy Rita Delia Casco denied Sandinista troopsentered Honduran territory. ``What they have said is mere lies,''said Ms. Casco, the Foreign Ministry's director of internationalorganizations.   ``We (Nicaraguans) can't withdraw from Nicaragua,'' she told anews conference after the emergency session ended. ``The militaryactions we have taken are limited to the defense of our territoryand sovereignty.''   The council adjourned without a resolution or a vote and was todecide whether to resume discussions at some future date.   Nicaragua's Sandinista government had asked for the meeting toprotest the sending of 3,200 U.S. military personnel to HondurasThursday and Friday.   Ms. Casco said a U.S. congressional delegation was welcome tovisit Nicaragua and would be escorted to key border areas to seethe situation.   After denouncing the United States in an address to the council,Ms. Casco shook hands and chatted with U.S. Ambassador Herbert S.Okun, who had accused Nicaragua of invading Honduras and rejectingdemocracy.   Okun, deputy chief of the U.S. mission, said sending U.S. troopsfor military exercises in Honduras was a measured responserequested by the Honduran government.   The U.S. force ``does not constitute either a threat or the useof force against Nicaragua,'' he said.   Okun also claimed the Santinistas were trying to destroyU.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, and stifle democratic debate.Many of the rebels operate from bases in Honduras, which bordersNicaragua.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is considering aNicaraguan request to send a fact-finding mission, coordinated withthe Organization of American States, to the Nicaraguan-Honduranborder.   Honduran Ambassador Jorge Ramon Hernandez told the council: ``IfNicaragua withdraws the troops which even today are in Honduras,that would be proof of its commitment to peace.   ``We denounce this invasion as the expansionistic, aggressiveattitude of Nicaragua, not only to my country but to others. It istrying to disrupt the whole, regional peace process.''   He accused Nicaragua of launching a ``broad-ranging offensive inflagrant violation of Honduran territorial integrity'' and saidHonduras had requested U.S. assistance.   Ms. Casco claimed the Reagan administration created anartificial crisis and was out to justify direct military actionagainst Nicaragua.   Okun said sending the troops was ``a measured response designedto show our staunch support for the democratic government ofHonduras at a time when its territorial integrity is being violatedby the Sandinista army.''   He said the U.S. troops would be involved in exercises away fromthe area of border hostilities.   Ms. Casco told the council Washington wants to sabotage CentralAmerican cease-fire talks and the peace plan signed in August bythe presidents of five Central American countries. The plan callsfor an end to outside aid to insurgents.   ``This is a crisis artificially created by the U.S.administration in its design to find justification for thecontinuation and extension of its warlike policy in CentralAmerica,'' she said.   ``The U.S. administration has considered a series of options,including the possibility of direct military action againstNicaragua in order to save its mercenaries (the rebels) who havebeen strategically defeated _ politically and militarily.''   In asking for the meeting, Nicaragua's acting ambassador, JulioIcaza Gallard, said the 15-member council should ``consider theserious situation created by the escalation of threats andaggression against my country and by the U.S. decision to sendAmerican troops to Honduran territory.''   Council members are the United States, Britain, China, Franceand the Soviet Union, which as permanent members have veto power,and Yugoslavia, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal,Senegal, West Germany and Zambia.</TEXT></DOC>
