Mr. Engleman is 53years old.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,UnionFed fell 25 cents to $3.375.   The agreement with regulators caps an examination lastsummer of the once-sleepy Brea, Calif., thrift that prompteda wave of loan-loss reserves and nonperforming loans.   UnionFed said Union Federal agreed to a cease-and-desistorder from the Office of Thrift Supervision. The order, whichis expected to be issued shortly, calls for Union Federal tostrengthen internal controls over, among other things,limitations on loans to individual borrowers, internal assetreview and classification, loan underwriting anddocumentation, and real estate appraisals.   A spokesman for UnionFed wouldn't disclose specifics ofregulators' objections to the thrift's past practices. Hesaid not all seven board members acceded to the individualcivil fines and emphasized that payment was deemed &quot;moreexpedient&quot; than protracted regulatory proceedings. Hedeclined to say whether Mr. Kringen is among those paying thepenalties or to disclose the amounts of the fines.   A spokeswoman for the Office of Thrift Supervision saidthe agency won't comment on its oversight of individualsavings and loans.   UnionFed, with assets of $2.4 billion and 27 branches inSouthern California, reported a net loss of $11.6 million, or$1.55 a share, for the second quarter ended Dec. 31.Provisions for losses in the period jumped to $17 millionfrom $3 million a year earlier, as a range of real estate andconstruction loans were declared nonperforming or foreclosedupon.   The write-downs and losses followed the Office of ThriftSupervision's examination but weren't explicitly linked toit.   Union Federal has risk-based capital, a measure offinancial reserves, equal to 5% of total adjusted assets --less than the 7.2% required by regulators.   Regulators recently rejected a plan by the thriftoutlining how it hoped to comply with the capitalrequirement. A new plan was filed Thursday. UnionFed said itbelieves the latest filing, which was guided by objections tothe earlier plan, will be acceptable to the Office of ThriftSupervision.</TEXT></DOC>
