However, with theexception of one Japanese survey, there have not been any recognizedforecasts suggesting a timeframe and relative economic impact for proposedhigh-Tc products. The purpose of this survey is to provide definitiveprojections of the timetable for high-Tc product development, based onthe combined forecasts of the leading U.S. superconductivity experts.The FTS panel of experts on high-Tc superconductor applications, representingboth business and research, forecast the commercialization and economicimpact for 28 classes of electronic, magnetic, communications, instrumentation,transportation, industrial, and power generation products. In most cases,forecasts predict the occurrence of developments within a 90% statisticalconfidence limit of 2-to-3 years. The report provides background informationon the 28 application areas, as well as other information useful forstrategic planners. The panel also forecast high-Tc research spending,markets, and international competitiveness, and provide insight intohow the industry will evolve.</TEXT></DOC>
