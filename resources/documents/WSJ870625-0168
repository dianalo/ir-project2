At the same time, officials of the big telecommunications company expressed optimism that they will win a two-year-old fight for Japanese government permission to invest in a planned new telephone service in Japan. Cable andamp; Wireless already runs phone services in Britain, Hong Kong and 34 other countries.    Cable andamp; Wireless said pre-tax profit in fiscal 1987 rose to #340 million ($544 million) from #295 million a year earlier. Net income, including an extraordinary charge of #9 million for losses from the closure of some U.S. subsidiaries, climbed 19%, to #215 million from #180 million. Revenue increased 0.7%, to #913 million ($1.46 billion) from #907 million.    Cable andamp; Wireless's full-year results matched analysts' expectations. Nevertheless, the company's stock fell on some bearish earnings forecasts -- including one from its own broker, Cazenove andamp; Co. In London trading yesterday, the stock fell 25 pence (40 cents), to 385 pence a share. </TEXT></DOC>
