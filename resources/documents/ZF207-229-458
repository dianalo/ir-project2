(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Gray ExpectationsandM;When the Macintosh burst onto the computer scene in 1984, it was hailed asthe electronic equivalent of a graphics studio.andP;  As long as you createdeverything from scratch, using the fonts and drawing and painting tools onthe computer, it was a brilliant conceit.andP;  But if your artistic talents werelimited to scratching out stick figures, or if you wanted to usenonelectronic artwork, your options were few.andP;  True, desktop scanners alsomade their debut in 1984, but poor image quality and high prices limitedtheir appeal.andP;  For the average user, there was no satisfactory way to bringhigh-quality drawings, photos, or text from the outside world to the digitaldesktop.andM;Fast-forward to 1989.andP;  MacUser Labs receives nearly a dozen of the trendiestperipherals in Macdom: gray-scale scanners.andP;  Recent advancements in scanningtechnology have spawned a new generation of desktop scanners with higherresolutions, expanded gray-scale capabilities, and lower prices.andP;  Today, ascanner that captures 256 levels of gray costs around $2,000 -- that'scheaper than a black-and-white model just two years ago.andM;To evaluate the current state of the gray-scale-scanner market, we put eightpopular flatbed models -- that Abaton Scan 300/S, AGFA Focus S800GS, AppleScanner, Dest PC Scan 1000, Hewlett-Packard ScanJet Plus, Microtek MSF-300QS,New Image MacScanPro, and Xerox Imaging System's Datacopy 730GS -- throughtheir paces.andP;  All the scanners, except the AGFA, have resolutions of 300 dotsper inch (dpi).andP;  We threw in AGFA's 400-dpi scanner to see how the higherresolution affected scanner performance.andM;We judged each scanner on its image sharpness, gray range, halftone quality,text-extraction capabilities, and ease of use.andP;  The results revealed eachscanner's strengths and weaknesses as well as the sophistication andversatility of the software.andP;  Overall, the scanners ranged from very basicmodels to professional publishing machines; you should choose a scanner basedon your applications and desired level of performance.andM;Popularity ExplosionandM;The recent explosion in scanner popularity was triggered by the Mac II, withits increased processing power, and the introduction of gray-scale monitorsand image-editing software such as Digital Darkroom and ImageStudio, whichlet you see and manipulate multiple levels of gray.andM;The gray-scale scanner has become the darling of the desktop-publishingworld.andP;  You can scan a photograph into your Mac, enhance it withimage-editing software, scale it for placement in a page-layout program, andprint it along with text on a camera-ready page.andP;  Although the image qualitystill doesn't match that of traditional halftone photographs, it's goodenough for most rudimentary and midlevel publishing needs.andM;Desktop publishers aren't the only ones benefitting from the scannerrevolution.andP;  Artists, engineers, and mapmakers, among others, can minimizemanual tracing and redrawing by using a scanner to input drawings, logos,blueprints, circuit diagrams, and detailed maps.andM;Anyone who processes words (or numbers) for a living will enjoy thelabor-saving benefits of a scanner coupled to anoptical-character-recognition (OCR) program.andP;  OCR turns printed words intoelectronic text files, eliminating the need for retyping.andP;  Letters, articles,books, forms, spreadsheets -- all can be input rapidly to your Mac with ascanner and OCR software.andM;Green for GraysandM;The current crop of gray-scale scanners is certainly tantalizing, but howmuch green will you have to pay for the grays?andP;  Scanner prices are droppingfast (both Microtek and New Image lowered their prices during the course ofthis report), but, in general, price and number of bits rise together.andM;Four-bit scanners with 16 grays retail for less than $1,800; 6-bit models (64grays) are about $2,000, and New Image's 8-bit MacScanPro (256 grays) goesfor $2,495.andP;  The real bargain is Hewlett-Packard's ScanJet Plus, which has 8bits (256 grays) but a price of only $2,190.andP;  On the other hand, the AGFAFocus S800GS has only 6 bits, but its 400-dpi resolution demands a hefty$5,495.andM;But before you plunk down $2,000+ for the latest model, consider your totalinvestment.andP;  A gray-scale scanner may seem expensive, but it's only thebeginning.andP;  You can't see the grays without a gray-scale monitor and videocard ($1,500 to $3,500).andP;  Gray-scale files can be several megabytes in size,so you may need to buy elusive and premium-priced RAM.andP;  And you shouldn'teven consider working with gray-scale images without a sizable hard disk.andP;  Ifyour scanner's software has limited image-editing abilities, you may needadditional software, such as Silicon Beach's Digital Darkroom ($295) orLetraset's ImageStudio ($495).andM;Does the total bill make you feel faint?andP;  If so, and if your scanning demandsare low-key, then you might consider some of the low-cost alternatives (see&quot;Scanning on the Cheap&quot; and &quot;A Scan in the Hand&quot; sidebars).andM;Flatbed or Sheetfed?andM;Scanners look and act a lot like photocopiers, except that the resultingimage is an electronic bit map rather than ink on a piece of paper.andP;  Inflatbed scanners, the light source moves across the original document;sheetfed machines hold the light steady and feed the original through a pairof rollers.andM;Sheetfed scanners are cheaper, but they accept pages of only certain sizesand thicknesses.andP;  Sheetfed models can also cause image distortions becausethey have problems with page alignment.andP;  A sheetfed scanner is a good choicefor OCR, however, since it is easily fitted with an automatic document feederfor rapidly scanning many pages.andM;Flatbed scanners, the kind we're reviewing here, provide higher-qualityimages because the original doesn't move.andP;  In general, they're a betterinvestment, in that you can precisely position artwork and scan documents ofany size and thickness: photographs, books, or oversized technical drawings.andO;Some flatbed scanners, such as the Dest and Hewlett-Packard models, can alsobe equipped with automatic sheet feeders.andM;Unlike photocopiers, scanners rarely have hardware controls; everythinghappens through software.andP;  One exception is the Apple Scanner, which offersone-touch scanning through its Remote Scan button.andP;  After setting thescanning parameters at your Mac, just press the button at the scanner, andthe software controls the scans and saves them with sequential filenames.andO;Remote scanning is handy if you're scanning a stack of photographs, forexample, or a set of papers to be read by an OCR program.andM;Under the HoodandM;Scanning technology isn't sleight of hand, but it does use lights and mirrorsto give itself a good image.andP;  Light bounces off the original image and isconveyed, via a series of mirrors, to the scanner's &quot;eyes&quot; -- the chargedcoupled device (CCD), a single row of up to 4,000 tightly packed lightsensors.andM;The CCD produces an electrical signal proportional to the amount of lightstriking it.andP;  A dark spot on the original reflects less light, so less lightfalls onto the CCD, producing a lower voltage.andP;  Likewise, a light-coloredobject produces a stronger voltage.andP;  The scanner's electronics convert thesevoltage levels into digital gray-scale values and transmit them to thecomputer.andP;  The accuracy of the gray-scale data can be affected by severalfactors, including colors, glare, dust, grease spots, and electrical noise.andM;The transport mechanism of motors, pulleys, and gears is precisely engineeredto ensure that the mirrors and lenses remain in focus by keeping the lengthof the light path constant.andP;  A vibrating transport causes image distortions,just as a shaky hand blurs a photograph.andP;  The precision required of theengine is one factor that makes scanners so expensive.andM;Of the scanner makers whose products we tested, only AGFA and Microtek maketheir own engines.andP;  Three scanners have Canon engines (Hewlett-Packardcodevelops its engines with Canon), and Abaton and Apple use a TEC engine.andO;We couldn't find any problems or discernible differences in the engines.andM;All the scanners have flat, uniform lighting provided by either incandescentor fluorescent bulbs.andP;  The ScanJet Plus automatically compensates for changesin light intensity; the MacScanPro leaves it up to the user.andP;  Light intensityis an especially important consideration for 8-bit scanners, since anydeviation can distort the gray-scale values.andM;The Resolution FactorandM;The quality of a gray-scale image depends largely on two factors: resolutionand the number of gray levels.andP;  Resolution is simply the number of pixels ascanner can cram into an inch.andP;  A pixel, or picture element, is the smallestarea the scanner &quot;sees.&quot;andP;  In scanning terminology, pixels are sometimescalled samples, because the scanner obtains data by &quot;sampling&quot; the originalimage.andP;  To confuse matters further, manufacturrs list a scanner's resolutionin dots per inch (dpi), the ubiquitous unit of measurement also used formonitors and printers.andM;In general, the higher the resolution, the more detail an image has--finerlines, smaller type, or more subtle gray transitions.andP;  Resolution isespecially important for engineering and architectural drawings, maps, andother highly detailed images in which minute features are critical.andM;Of the scanners we tested, seven have a maximum resolution of 300 dots (orpixels) per inch; the AGFA can record up to 400 dpi.andP;  A 300-dpi resolutionmatches that of most laser printers; thus, the scanned and printed imageswill be the same size and show the same amount of detail.andP;  The addedresolution of AGFA's scanner is barely noticeable on a 300-dpi printer, butit provides superior image quality for magnifying an image or sending outputto a high-resolution printer.andM;Keep in mind that if the scanned and printed resolutions don't match, theimage sizes won't be the same.andP;  For example, an image scanned at 300 dpi andprinted at 600 dpi will be only one-fourth its original size.andP;  Why?andP;  Becausea 600-dpi printer has twice as many dots per inch in both dimensions.andP;  Youcan't add more dots (pixels) to the scanned image, so two of its 300-dpiinches will fit into each of the printer's 600-dpi inches, both horizontallyand vertically.andM;You get the opposite effect when displaying a scanned image on a standard72-dpi monitor.andP;  Since the monitor can fit only one-fourth as many dots intoan inch, the image will be four times its original (scanned) size.andP;  Althoughyou won't be able to see all the image's details at 72 dpi, it will printwith its full 300-dpi resolution.andM;Super-SamplingandM;If you don't need all those extra pixels or you're short on RAM and diskspace, most scanners can do subsampling; that is, they can scan atresolutions below their maximum setting.andP;  Only the Abaton Scan 300/S locksyou into 300-dpi scans (although you can scale images, which is almost thesame thing).andM;A few scanners also claim to do super-sampling.andP;  AGFA's scanner has a nominalresolution of 400 dpi, but it provides an &quot;addressable&quot; resolution of up to800 dpi through interpolation.andP;  Its circuitry averages an image's gray-scalevalues and places new pixels between the existing ones.andP;  the ScanJet Plususes a similar scheme to create resolutions of up to 1,500 dpi -- selectablein 1-pixel increments -- although its true resolution is only 300 dpi.andM;But don't be fooled by the hype.andP;  These scanners are not true high-resolutionmachines.andP;  Interpolated images have more data, but they don't print withhigher resolutions.andM;On high-resolution printers, the added data merely performs a smoothingfunction, providing better transitions between grays and reducing the jaggieson fine diagonal lines.andM;Shades of GrayandM;The number of grays a scanner can produce, its gray scale, depends on theamount of data it can record about each pixel.andP;  The first desktop scannerssaw everything in black and white because they used only one bit of digitaldata to dexcribe each pixel.andP;  They created the illusion of grays by dithering-- turning various combinations of pixels on (black) and off (white).andP;  Thegreater the number of pixels that were turned on in a particular area, thedarker the simulated &quot;gray.&quot;andP;  In the scanner world, dithered images are alsocalled halftones, so named for their resemblance to traditional photographichalftones (see glossary).andM;Today's scanners can capture true grays because they store more informationper pixel.andP;  The Apple Scanner, for example, stores 4 bits of data per pixel;thus, the pixel can be one of 16 shades of gray.andP;  Likewise, Microtek's 6-bitscanner can display 64 grays, and New Image's 8-bit model can render imageswith 256 gray levels.andM;Gray-scale scanners still offer you the option of dithering, which can savescanning time and disk space for images that are mainly black-and-white orthat will be printed at low resolutions.andP;  Unfortunately, dithering an imageduring the scanning process locks in its resolution and dither pattern.andP;  A300-dpi halftone prints at the same resolution on a Linotronic as it does ona laser printer.andP;  Editing dithered images is virtually impossible; you can'teven adjust the contrast and brightness.andP;  Furthermore, if you resize theimage -- for placing in a page-layout program, for example -- you may wind upwith ugly moire patterns.andP;  (Actually, you can halve or double the size, butthat's about it.)andM;In comparison, working with a gray-scale image is nirvana.andP;  You can resizeand edit at will, adjust the contrast and brightness, lighten or darken(dodge or burn) selected areas, soften or sharpen, blend, smudge, or executespecial effects using posterization (limiting the number of grays) and gammacorrection (changing the brightness of selected grays).andP;  Additionally, youcan output the image at whatever resolution your printer can handle.andM;Even so, a gray-scale image usually looks better on-screen than it does onpaper, because a printer can't print grays.andP;  It has only black ink, so theimage still has to be halftoned -- that is, converted to a black-and-whitedither pattern that simulates the original grays.andP;  But dithering on theoutput end means you can manipulate the gray-scale image to your heart'scontent before you print.andM;If, for some reason, you scan an image in the halftone mode nd later want toconvert it to gray scale, all is not lost.andP;  Both ImageStudio and DigitalDarkroom can convert 1-bit, 300-dpi images into 4-bit, 75-dpi images.andP;  Youlose three-fourths of the resolution, but you gain 16 grays that can beedited for maximum effect.andP;  Other gray levels are also available, withcorrespondingly lower resolutions.andM;How Much Gray?andM;How much gray do you really need?andP;  That depends on the image and how you planto use it.andP;  For drawings, text, and other black-and-white images, a 4-bitscanner (16 grays) will probably suffice.andP;  High resolution and precisealignment are more important than gray levels for line art.andP;  Gray-scaleimages, on the other hand, need at least 64 grays (6 bits) to trick the eyeinto thinking they are continuous-tone photographs.andP;  Four-bit images have abanded, paint-by-numbers look in areas that are short on detail and long onsubtle gray transitions, such as clouds.andP;  For low-end desktop publishing suchas newsletter production, most people do fine with 1-bit dithered images.andO;Even if you use traditional photographic halftones for your publications,digital halftones can serve as placeholders to indicate scaling and cropping.andM;If you prefer the editing power of grays but are printing on a 300-dpi laserprinter, stick with a 6-bit scanner.andP;  The 64 grays it provides are more thanadequate for that resolution.andP;  Why?andP;  Because halftoning requires a trade-offbetween resolution and gray levels.andP;  The more gray levels you want tosimulate, the lower the printing resolution, and vice versa.andP;  At its defaultresolution of 53 dpi, the the LaserWriter can show only 32 grays.andP;  (For acomplete explanation of resolution, gray scale, and digital halftones, see &quot;ATouch of Gray,&quot; February '89).andP;  Using a high-resolution typesetter such asthe 2,540-dpi Linotronic 300 eliminates this consideration.andP;  If you have an8-bit scanner, you can print halftones with 256 grays at magazine-qualityresolutions (133 to 150 dpi).andP;  Even if you don't print all 256 grays (thatnumber is usually more than you need), such a scanner gives you more controlduring the image-editing process.andM;Fade to Black (and White)andM;Although gray-scale scanning can produce spectacular results, for many jobsit's neither necessary nor desirable.andP;  OCR, for example, is faster and moreaccurate in the line-art mode.andP;  Line art refers to images -- such as drawingsand text -- that are black-and-white only, with no gray tones (although theycan have dithered patterns).andM;Setting scanning parameters is simpler for line-art images, but they demandmore from the scanner's electronics than do gray-scale images.andP;  For agray-scale image, the scanner simply rounds off a voltage to the nearest graylevel.andP;  But for line art, it must decide whether each pixel should be blackor white, depending on the range of grays in the scan area.andP;  This process iscalled thresholding, and most scanners have a default value that adjustsautomatically during scanning.andP;  All pixels darker than the default are turnedblack, while lighter ones become white.andM;The Apple Scanner has a threshold control that lets you change the defaultvalue.andP;  The inclusion of this control is fortuitous, since this particularscanner has the worst default thresholding of the scanners we tested,requiring the most adjustment to produce optimum results.andM;Space and TimeandM;Once you get your hands on a gray-scale scanner, you may be tempted to scaneverything at the highest resolution and maximum number of grays.andP;  Don't.andO;You'll be sorry.andM;Huge data files are the bane of gray-scale scanning (see Table 2).andP;  An8.5-x-11-inch image scanned at 300 dpi with 64 gray levels takes up more than6 megabytes.andP;  Even a 4-x-5-inch image with a mere 16 grays claims a whopping900K.andP;  Most of the scanning programs have compression schemes that reduceTIFF-file sizes, but although compression works well on 1-bit images,compression ratios for multibit images are fairly low.andP;  You'll probably windup using shareware file-compression utilities such as StuffIt or PackIt toconserve disk space.andM;Most scanning programs can save files in other formats, such as Paint, PICT,and EPSF.andP;  These formats are accepted by more programs than are TIFF files,but they can't be edited in gray-scale applications.andP;  Furthermore, EPSFimages are even bigger than TIFF files -- up to four times as large!andP;  (Formore information on file formats, including a table of programs and theformats they accept, see &quot;Graphic Examples,&quot; April '89).andM;Obviously, you'll need a substantial hard disk to accommodate these spacehogs.andP;  It takes only three 6-megabyte images to fill a 20-megabyte hard disk.andO;Removable media are another alternative, especially if you make trips to aservice bureau.andM;You'll also need lots of RAM.andP;  Six of the scanners send images to RAM; onlythe Hewlett-Packard and Abaton models scan data directly to disk.andP;  Severalscanners ran out of RAM (on an 8-megabyte Mac II) while scanning an8.5-x-11-inch photograph.andP;  The software for the AGFA, Datacopy, and Microtekscanners avoids this pitfall by telling you how much space a given scanrequires.andP;  Datacopy's Mac-Image also shows you how long a scan will take -- anice touch.andP;  Gray-scale images also take a long time to scan, save, retrieve,edit, and print.andP;  Abaton's Scan 300/S was the the tortoise to Microtek's hareduring our testing.andP;  Dest's PC Scan 1000 fared well during scanning, but ittook an astounding seven minutes to save the 8.5-x-11-inch gray-scale imageto disk.andM;If your service bureau charges by the minute, printing gray-scale images canbankrupt you in a hurry.andP;  Most scanners let you pick the scan resolution andnumber of bits, so use the lowest resolution and fewest grays you can withoutjeopardizing image quality.andP;  Use the smallest possible image area, and cropyour images before test-printing them.andM;Soft SellandM;Since scanners are controlled entirely through software, the programs thatcome with your scanner are as important as the machine itself.andP;  Scanningsoftware is as diverse as the hardware is similar, so test-drive the scannerand software before taking the financial plunge.andM;The software we tested ranged from the minimalist offerings of Abaton andDest to the supermarket of selection in Datacopy's MacImage (see Table 1).andO;Editing power and tools vary widely from scanner to scanner.andP;  All theprograms except Abaton's PanelScan offer basic paint tools, but none has thegray-scale-editing sophistication of Digital Dark-room or ImageStudio.andO;Rather than compete, Microtek has implemented its scanner driver as plug-inmodules for both Digital Darkroom and SuperPaint, which come bundled with thescanner.andM;Some scanner companies are making it easier to scan from within otherprograms by creating their drivers as cdevs or desk accessories rather thanas stand-alone programs (see &quot;Scannectivity&quot; sidebar).andP;  Hewlett-Packard'ssoftware package, Desk Gallery Plus, consists of two DAs, DeskScan andZedcor's DeskPaint.andP;  Abaton's scanner comes with PanelScan, a cdev that canbe accessed from within any application.andP;  PanelScan scans directly to aprenamed file on disk, so it needs only about 100K of RAM.andP;  Unfortunately, ithas no postscan view or editing tools of any sort.andM;Be sure that your scanner software offers a preview -- a quick,low-resolution scan that helps you select which part of the image you wantfor the actual, full-strength scan.andP;  Typically, previews are dithered imagesthat don't work for adjusting contrast or brightness.andP;  The exception to therule is DeskScan's Live Preview, which sacrifices detail for an actualgray-scale image.andP;  If you adjust the contrast or brightness, the previewreflects the changes without requiring a rescan.andM;At the other extreme, PanelScan's previews are so poor that they arepractically worthless -- gray-scale images appear as solid black blobs.andP;  NewImage's MacScan offers no preview at all, a crippling oversight.andP;  Instead,you use rulers to guess at the location of the section you want and performrepeated scans and repositionings until you locate it precisely.andP;  If you everscan in a halftone and then wish it were gray scale, however, MacScan is theonly program you can use to convert 300-dpi halftones to 75-dpi, 4-bitgray-scale images.andM;All the scanners have settings for line art, halftones, and gray scale.andP;  TheMicrotek, Apple, and Datacopy scanners let you mix halftone and line-artmodes in a single scan for those times when text and continuous-tone graphicsshare the same page.andP;  With Microtek, you select the overall image to bescanned and then select up to three smaller areas that can be set to line artwhile the rest of the image is halftoned, or vice versa.andP;  AppleScan has twononoverlapping windows, which can have different resolutions as well asdifferent scan modes (including gray scale).andP;  Datacopy has only one window,but its Mixed Line Art mode lets you capture line art and halftones in onescan.andM;All the programs except MacScan let you scale images during the scanningprocess to match the size you need for placement in a document or forprinting -- you usually end up with better image quality than if you resizethe image later within an application.andP;  Scaling an image down also helpsconserve RAM and disk space.andP;  PanelScan is the only program lacking a zoomfeature for closeup views of scanned images.andM;Special FeaturesandM;Datacopy's MacImage and AGFA's MC View Plus have the best-rounded set offeatures, including a broad range of scan settings and dither patterns, andpostscan control over brightness, contrast, and gamma correction.andP;  (Actually,Microtek has the most powerful software, if you count Digital Darkroom.)andP;  Bycontrast, Dest's Publish Pac has no image editing and can display gray-scaleimages only as halftones.andM;Both MacImage and Apple's AppleScan let you customize dither patterns andsave scan parameters for later use.andP;  MacImage enables you to burn (darken)and dodge (lighten) selected gray regions of scans.andP;  MC View Plus knows theright output format for a variety of page-layout programs, and it's the onlypackage that continually checks for viral infections (it told us when webecame infected with nVIR).andM;If you like the auto-tracing features of programs such as Illustrator 88,you'll appreciate the Edge Detection mode of MacImage, which outlines lineart during the scanning process.andP;  MC View Plus has a more sophisticatedversion of this feature, called vectorization, which can convert line art andhalftones into object-oriented images with Bezier curves, images that can besaved as Illustrator files.andM;PanelScan is the only program that cannot print images directly.andP;  MC ViewPlus and MacImage have particularly strong printing features, includinghalftone settings and the ability to print sections of scanned views.andO;(Again, Microtek's use of Digital Darkroom gives it a leg up in this area.)andM;The Apple Scanner is bundled with AppleScan and HyperScan, which scans imagesdirectly into HyperCard stacks.andP;  You can move images from scanners intoHyperCard without it -- via the Clipboard or Scrapbook -- but HyperScan makesit easy.andP;  AppleScan lets you scan irregularly shaped areas, and an adaptivefilter converts scanned gray-scale images into halftones.andP;  Amazingly enough,AppleScan can save but not open TIFF files; it opens only PICT-format files.andM;Four scanners have optional OCR packages.andP;  Dest's Text Processor is aboard-based system that provides faster scanning times than doessoftware-based OCR.andP;  Datacopy's AccuText rivals stand-alone OCR packages; asfor the others, you're better off buying OCR software separately (see &quot;LightReading&quot; sidebar).andM;Testing, TestingandM;AGFA's Focus S800GS, with its all-metal case, is the heaviest and sturdiestscanner we tested.andP;  (It's also the noisiest, but just during scans.)andP;  TheDatacopy 730GS is the sleekest, with the smallest footprint -- a mere 222square inches, compared with AGFA's 389.andM;All the scanners connect to the Mac's SCSI port, although three -- the Dest,Hewlett-Packard, and New Image models -- require special interface boxes andcables because they come with non-SCSI connectors.andP;  Dest's interface box isparticularly cumbersome, with a 90-square-inch footprint, a separate powersupply, and a tangle of cords and plugs.andM;We evaluated the scanners in five major areas: image sharpness, gray range,half-tone quality, OCR capabilities, and ease of use (see Table 3).andP;  Allscans were at 100-percent scaling, 300-dpi resolution (400 for the AGFA), anddefault contrast and brightness values.andP;  Then, to get the best performancepossible from each scanner, we ran additional scans at optimized settings.andO;All images were saved as uncompressed TIFF files.andM;Unresolved Differences: To determine resolvability (how well the scannerspicked up details), we scanned the Image System Test Target in the line-artmode.andP;  This test sheet, available from the Patent and Trademark Office,contains a series of shapes, line pairs, and text of varying sizes.andP;  Welooked for blurring in the smallest line pairs and deformities in thefour-point type to determine the minimum feature size each scanner couldclearly see.andM;As expected, the AGFA left the other scanners in the dust; its 400-dpiresolution enabled it to resolve even the finest details of text and lineart.andP;  Hewlett-Packard's ScanJet Plus had the sharpest image of the 300-dpiscanners, and Abaton's Scan 300/S had the worst.andM;Grading the Grays: Most scanners &quot;see&quot; only a limited range of grays, so wegave them a vision test.andP;  We scanned 16 blocks of a Kodak Gray-Scale TestStrip, which has 20 blocks of gray of increasing intensity, and counted thenumber of gray levels each scanner sensed.andP;  As expected, the 4-bit scanners(Abaton, Apple, Dest) didn't see as many grays as the 6- and 8-bit units did.andO;The 6-bit Microtek scanner actually picked up more grays than did the 8-bitScanJet Plus.andM;Halftone Quality: Nearly everyone who uses a scanner scans photos, and we'reno exception.andP;  We repeatedly scanned black-and-white photos of a countrycabin and of San Francisco in both gray-scale and halftone modes to see howwell the scanners handled grays and how accurately they dithered halftones.andM;Then we printed two halftone images for each scanner, one at default settingsand the other optimized.andP;  The 300-dpi halftones were output on a LaserWriterIINTX; the AGFA's 400-dpi output went to an AGFA P3400 PS laser printer.andP;  Ina blind test, a five-person panel judged each picture's shadow detail,highlights, fine detail, and contrast.andM;The AGFA's high resolution again put it atop the heap.andP;  The Datacopy 730GSalso did well, displaying a wide range of grays and good shadow detail.andM;Text Extraction: OCR is a popular use for scanners, so we evaluated how welleach one could separate text from its background.andP;  Scanners that are betterat thresholding extract text more successfully and thus provide images thatOCR software can read more accurately.andM;We used the scanners' own software to scan newspaper articles and examples of&quot;difficult&quot; text -- poorly printed, low-contrast, and colored text on coloredbackgrounds.andP;  The scans were done in the default line-art mode and again atoptimized settings.andP;  We then read the scanned samples with Caere's OmniPageand compared its output with the actual text, using the percentage of correctwords to rate the scanner's thresholding skill.andM;The Abaton and Hewlett-Packard scanners excelled at text extraction,distinguishing even the most difficult text with ease.andP;  The AGFA's 400-dpiresolution provided superior results when picking up the fine type in a phonebook, even after it had been photocopied twice.andP;  Unfortunately, the higherresolution worked against it in the other tests, because it picked up toomany background details.andM;The Microtek and New Image scanners bottomed out in the difficult-textdepartment; they had trouble separating text from shaded or coloredbackgrounds, and there was much blurring and touching of letters.andP;  The AppleScanner actually did worse on the newsprint than on the difficult text, andwe spent more time optimizing its scans than those of the other scanners.andM;You can probably improve on these results by fiddling with the scanparameters, but we do wish scanner manufacturers would include a scan modespecifically for text extraction.andP;  Users could specify whether the printedmatter was newsprint, colored text, or background; the font size; and so on.andO;The scanner would then pick the ideal threshold and resolution settings tooptimize text extraction under those conditions.andM;Ease of Use: No mystery here -- how friendly, how easy to use, how powerfulis the software that comes with each scanner?andP;  Three first-time users ratedeach scanner on its ease of use (for controls such as brightness, contrast,scaling, and zoom), image-editing power, and helpfulness of &quot;help&quot;information.andM;The Apple Scanner was the favorite in this category for its excellent manual,tutorials, and intuitive controls.andP;  Although they pack a lot of power, boththe Datacopy 730GS and ScanJet Plus are easy to learn and use, with goodmanuals and nice interfaces.andP;  The ScanJet Plus also has an impressiveon-screen help file, and the Datacopy has a Short Menus option for users whowant to keep it simple.andM;Scanning the FutureandM;Will the scanner you buy today be obsolete six months or a year from now?andO;Since 256 levels of gray is enough for most scanning purposes, you don't haveto worry about grayer machines appearing on the scene.andP;  Instead, the trend inhigh-end scanning is toward greater and greater resolution.andP;  With higherresolution, you'll see finer detail, and jaggies will become a historicalfootnote.andP;  Siemens, which competes with AGFA and Microtek in the expensive400-dpi market, plans to have a 600-dpi scanner within a year or so.andM;Look to laser printers, not scanners, for the next revolution in desktoppublishing.andP;  Companies such as DP-Tek and Seikosha are pioneering printertechnologies that use variable dot sizes and/or true grays.andP;  Suchbreakthroughs will truly revolutionize the appearance of halftones, line art,and text printed on a 300-dpi printer -- or on a high-resolution typesetter.andM;Scanning on the CheapandM;If your wallet says &quot;no&quot; to a flatbed or sheetfed scanner, consider theselow-priced alternatives:andM;ThunderScan, from ThunderWare (Orinda, Calif.), transforms an ImageWriter Ior II (but not an LQ) into a scanner by swapping a scanning head for theprinter's ribbon cartridge.andP;  The head sweeps back and forth across the paperas it feeds through the printer's rollers, capturing information instead ofprinting it.andP;  This innovative product has shown amazing vigor against today'ssophisticated competition, given that it's as much as 100 times slower thanthe average flatbed scanner, is difficult to focus, and can scan only whatfits between the rollers.andP;  We credit its longevity to elegant simplicity, lowprice, and some surprisingly sophisticated features: 32 levels (5 bits) ofgray, a maximum resolution of 288 dpi, and respectable scan-control andimage-editing software.andP;  ThunderScan lists for $249 but drops to $199 at manydiscount outlets.andM;The VisionScan 300, from Mirror Technologies (Roseville, Minn.), resembles anoverhead projector or enlarger.andP;  Its image sensor is mounted in a motionlesshead overhanging a scanning bed.andP;  Only a mirror within the head moves,reflecting an image from the bed onto the optical sensor.andP;  The 1-bit scannertakes about ten minutes to scan a letter-size page at its full 300-dpiresolution (that's four times faster than ThunderScan).andP;  It can also objectup to 1 inch in height.andP;  Mirror bundles VisionScan's driver software withZedcor's DeskPaint.andP;  The VisionScan 300 retails for $795; an older 200-dpimodel, the VisionScan 200, is $595.andM;VisionScan and ThunderScan both transfer image data via the serial port -- aboon if your Mac lacks a SCSI port but otherwise a culprit in the tediouspace of their scans.andM;If you have a stand-alone fax machine, you may be interested in FaxScan, fromMDIdeas (Foster City, Calif.), which turns your fax machine into a scanner(line art only!).andP;  This external box connects your Mac to the fax machine.andO;Flip a switch, and when you feed a document into your fax machine, instead ofgoing out over the phone line, the data feeds into your Mac.andP;  You can cut andpaste the resulting image via the Clipboard.andP;  At $299.95, FaxScan gives you afast and inexpensive scanner for your Mac, but it's compatible with Group IIfax machines only.andM;How It WorksandM;Illuminating the OriginalandM;In a flatbed scanner, the light bulb moves across a stationary original.andP;  Thelight shines on deflectors to illuminate the original without hot spots.andP;  Thedistance the light travels from the original to the CCD must remain constantfor the image to remain in focus.andP;  The transport mechanism of motors,pulleys, and gears is built with great precision in order to maintain acostant light-path length and avoid image distortions.andM;Charged Coupled DeviceandM;The CCD is tightly packed line of 2,000 to 4,000 photoelectric cells thatproduce a voltage proportional to the amount of light striking them.andP;  Eachcell corresponds to a single pixel on the scanned image, which is read oneline at a time.andP;  In this case, the stem of the apple reflects less light thanits background.andP;  Thus, less light reaches the CCD, and a lower voltage isproduced.andP;  This low voltage translates to a darker gray.andP;  A new chargeaccumulates in the exposed cells while previous charges are collected andmeasured by the analog-to-digital (A-to-D) converter.andM;Processing the Gray ScaleandM;The A-to-D converter mesures the incoming voltage and rounds it off to thenearest digital gray-scale value.andP;  The number of bits the scanner works withdetermines the gradations in the gray scale (16 for 4 bits, 256 for 8 bits).andO;For line art and halftones, the electronics convert gray-scale data toblack-and-white values.andM;Transmitting the DataandM;The external SCSI box handles data transmission between the logic board andthe Mac.andP;  Some scanners have a built-in SCSI Interface.andM;GlossaryandM;charged coupled device (CCD) -- A single row of up to 4,000 tightly packedphotoelectric cells that serves as the scanner's &quot;eyes.&quot;andP;  The CCD produces anelectrical voltage proportional to the amount of light striking it.andP;  Thisvoltage is converted to digital gray-scale values and transmitted to thecomputer.andM;continuous-tone image -- An image, such as a photograph or charcoal drawing,that has an unbroken, nearly infinite range of gray levels between black andwhite.andM;contrast -- An image's balance of gray tones.andP;  A scanner with good contrastprovides an even distribution of highlights, dark shadows, and midrangetones.andP;  High-contrast images have white highlights, black shadows, and fewmidlevel grays.andP;  Low-contrast images look washed out because they have toomany intermediate grays.andP;  When you change the contrast, every gray in theimage is affected, not just selected shades as in gamma correction.andM;dithering -- A digital technique for simulating grays by turning variouscombinations of pixels on (black) and off (white).andP;  The more pixels (or dots)turned on in a specific area, the darker the simulated gray.andP;  This method iswhat 1-bit scanners, monochrome monitors, and laser printers use to representgrays.andM;dots per inch (dpi) -- A generic term that describes the resolution ofprinters, monitors, and scanners.andP;  The ubiquitous use of dot can beconfusing, since the smallest element depicted by a scanner or monitor iscalled a pixel, yet their resolution is expressed in dots per inch.andM;flathed -- A scanner in which the original is placed on a glass surface andthe light source moves across it.andM;gamma correction -- A technique for globally changing the displayed (orprinted) brightness of one or more selected shades of gray.andP;  For example, youcan arbitrarily transform all 40-percent grays in an image to 72-percentgrays.andP;  Gamma correction is useful for bringing out shadow details or toningdown highlighted areas and usually involves the use of a graymap, a graphthat correlates stored grays with displayed grays.andM;gray scale -- Just another way of saying &quot;gray.&quot;andP;  Gray-scale images containtrue grays, rather than dithered black-and-white patterns, because each pixelis a shade of gray.andP;  The number of grays a scanner (or monitor) can representdepends on the number of bits of digital data that describe each pixel.andP;  A4-bit scanner can capture 16 grays; an 8-bit scanner can record 256 grays.andM;halftoning -- A method for reproducing a continuous-tone image, using a gridof evenly spaced dots.andP;  Different gray levels are simulated by variation inthe size of these dots.andP;  Halftones are necessary because a printer has onlyblack ink and thus can't reproduce a continuous-tone image.andP;  Because scannersand laser printers have a fixed dot size, digital halftones are createdthrough dithering.andM;interpoiation -- A technique for increasing the amount of data in a scan byaveraging an image's gray-scale values and placing new pixels betweenexisting ones.andP;  It does not increase the printed resolution.andP;  Also calledsuper-sampling.andM;line art -- Drawings, text, and other images that are black-and-white only,with no gray tones.andM;OCR -- Optical character recognition, the conversion of printed words toelectronic text.andM;pixel -- Picture element, the smallest area a scanner can record or a monitorcan display.andP;  If just one bit of digital data describes a pixel, it can beonly black or white.andP;  If a scanner records several bits of information perpixel, the pixel can appear as a shade of gray.andM;preview -- A rapid, low-resolution scan that shows the entire imageon-screen; useful for selecting the area for the main scan and optimizingscan settings.andM;resolution -- The maximum number of pixels that a scanner can fit into aninch.andP;  The higher the resolution, the more fine details you can see in animage.andP;  Resolution is usually expressed as dots per inch (dpi).andM;sample -- The smallest area a scanner can record, also called a pixel.andP;  Thename comes from a scanner's method of obtaining data by &quot;sampling&quot; theoriginal image; that is, it records the grayness of each sampling site.andM;scan -- To digitize, or convert, a real-world image, such as a photograph ortext, into but of data on a computer.andP;  The resulting digital image is alsocalled a scan.andM;sheetfed -- A scanner with a fixed light source that feeds the originalthrough a pair of rollers.andM;TIFF -- Tag image file format, a versatile method for storing bit-mappedimages in various resolutions and numbers of grays.andP;  TIFF was createdspecifically for the storage of gray-scale data and is considered to be thestandard format for saving scanned images.andM;thresholding -- A process for eliminating gray-scale information from a scan,used mainly for line art and text.andP;  All pixels darker than a certain graylevel turn black, and lighter pixels become white.andP;  The thresh-old value isusually adjusted automatically and continuously by the scanner, depending onthe range of gray values in the scanning area.andM;vectorization -- A means of converting line art or halftones into a group ofvectors, or objects, for editing in programs such as Illustrator.andM;A Scan in the HandandM;Scanners don't have to be big, serious, high-end office equipment.andP;  Thesmall, mobile scanning wands recently introduced for the Macintosh have theMac community abuzz over their signature-scooping, clip-art-collecting, andlogo-lifting talents.andP;  These &quot;personal scanners&quot; can scan anything reasonablyflat, albeit in narrow swaths.andP;  But you have to have a steady hand, or you'llwind up seeing double.andM;LightningScan, the first Mac hand scanner, was introduced last December byThunderWare (Orinda, Calif.).andP;  It scans images of up to 4.1 inches wide at100 to 400 dpi and has three dither patterns, a line-art mode, and adjustablebrightness.andP;  The software has some image-editing tools and can save inseveral file formats.andP;  LightningScan doesn't save grays, but on a Mac II thesoftware can recover 16 gray levels from the dithered image.andP;  The scanningwand, which connects to the SCSI port, costs $549.andM;ScanMan is a similar product from Logitech (Fremont, Calif.) that scansimages up to 4.1-x-14 inches at resolutions of 100 to 400 dpi.andP;  Its DAsoftware includes various editing functions but doesn't recover grays fromhalftones.andP;  Logitech's combination of scanner head, SCSI interface box, andsoftware is $499.andM;Yet another contender, NCL America (Sunnyvale, Calif.), should be shippingits hand scanners by the time you read this.andP;  Omniscan-105 ($499) differslittle from the others, except that it offers only one resolution, 200 dpi.andO;NCL's second &quot;hand-held&quot; scanner, the gray-scale Omniscan-A4, stretches thatdefinition just a bit.andP;  You can roll the 8.5-inch-wide platform over aletter-size page or let the original do the walking by snapping the scanningwand into a motorized transport for sheetfeeding.andP;  With 64 gray levels, true400-dpi resolution (plus 200- and 300-dpi settings), and a $1,350 price tag,the Omniscan-A4 competes with stationary scanners, lacking only the precisionalignment of flatbeds.andM;Another elephantine handful, the JX-100 from Sharp Electronics (Mahway,N.J.), is a marvel of compact color scanning.andP;  You just place the 3.5-poundunit over the original (4-x-6 inches maximum), and it moves an internalscanning head across a viewing window.andP;  Color scans take three minutes or so;gray-scale images (64 levels) take 40 seconds at 200 dpi.andP;  The hardware costs$995, including a cable to connect to the modem port (not the SCSI!).andP;  Thesoftware is another $150; it saves to PICT and TIFF formats but has noediting features.andM;Scan 300/SandM;By implementing its scanner driver as a a cdev, Abaton has made scanning fromwithin applications convenient.andP;

-- can now drive theApple Scanner.andP;  On the hardware side, Abaton, Dest, Microtek, New ImageTechnology, and Xerox Imaging Systems plan scanner interfaces that followApple's specifications.andM;In theory, you should be able to mix and match these applications andscanners at will, but we haven't tested that yet--Apple-spec interfaces onnon-Apple scanners are just beginning to emerge.andM;A Chooser-selectable scanner is another potential solution -- perhaps thecleanest one--to the plethora of scanner drivers.andP;  You would select a scannerfrom the Chooser just as you do with a printer.andP;  Then, by issuing a commandfrom the menu, you'd get a Scan dialog much like the current Print dialog.andO;Unfortunately, this idea hasn't caught on, although Nuvo Labs (San LuisObispo, Calif.) is developing Chooser-selectable scanner drivers that ithopes to market to scanner manufacturers.andM;In lieu of a standard, software developers Silicon Beach and Letraset havereworked Digital Darkroom and ImageStudio to accept user-installable&quot;plug-in&quot; scanner drivers (the modules are free for the asking from thescanner makers).andP;  Once you've dropped the appropriate module into theprogram's folder, it knows how to run your scanner, and you have scanningcontrol from its menus.andP;  Digital Darkroom works with plug-in modules forApple, Microtek, Abaton, and New Image scanners.andP;  ImageStudio works with onlyone module so far, for the Apple Scanner, but it will eventually work withscanners from Microtek and Xerox Imaging Systems.andM;Light Reading with OCRandM;Man does not communicate by pictures alone--that went out with theEgyptians--but until recently, that's about all Mac users could do with theirscanners.andP;  No more.andP;  Optical character recognition (OCR) has become a hotproperty, and scanners have now become viable text-entry devices.andM;The sheer diversity of Mac OCR products now available is a clear indicationof how important this market has become.andP;  For the casual user, there'sOlduvai's Read-It! (see this month's Quick Clicks), at $495.andP;  For businessesthat input tens of thousands of pages every month, Calera (Santa Clara,Calif.) has the networkable Compound Document Processor (CDP) 9000, ahardware/software combination that offers impressive speed and goes for awhopping $29,950.andP;  The software, TopScan/Mac, is another $695.andP;  And there areat least half dozen other packages that fall between these extremes.andM;The Mac's first OCR program (Read-It!) wasn't watershed.andP;  That distinctiongoes to OmniPage from Caere (Los Gatos.andP;  Calif.).andP;  Even though the $695program had limitations -- lots of them -- it represented a major advance inMac OCR technology.andP;  It was fast and accurate and could recognize most plainfonts, so you didn't spend enormous amounts of time teaching it the alphabet(see Quick Clicks, March '89).andP;  Apple quickly saw the program's potential andjumped on the bandwagon, and that extra push got Mac OCR moving.andP;  The latestincarnation of OmniPage, version 1.1, directly drives scanners from Apple,Dest, Hewlett-Packard, and Microtek.andM;Caere's accomplishments came at a price, however, OmniPage was inflexible.andO;Not only could not recognize styled fonts or unfamiliar characters, but youcouldn't teach it either.andP;  What was missing was a high-powered, teachable OCRpackage.andP;  Enter TextPert, the $695 package from CTA (New York, N.Y.) thatreads styled fonts and foreign characters and can be taught new characters asnecessary, provided you are willing to spend 15 minutes to an hour doing so.andM;Software-based OCR such as TextPert is flexible, but the trade-off is thatit's slow.andP;  To maximize speed, developers are turning to hardware-based OCR,and Calera is a leader in this trend.andP;  Calerahs CDP 9000 has nocharacter-learning capabilities, but by using four Motorola 68000 processors,it can scan and recognize a formated, letter-size page in less than 15seconds--usually much less.andP;  Dest's Text Processor ($995) is anotherhardware-based system that trades flexibility for speed.andM;To an extent, OmniPage presaged this development too.andP;  By requiring a Mac 11and 4 megabytes of RAM, Caere was clearly pointing toward a much morepowerful level of OCR.andP;  And that's exactly where things are headed.andM;AccuText, from Xerox Imaging Systems (marketed through Datacopy), $995software package with enough built-in artificial intelligence (thus the newacronym ICR, for intelligent character recognition) that it can read andpreserve italics, underlining, type-sized changes, indents, columns -- evenskewed text and fax transmissions.andP;  AccuText can drive the Datacopy scanners(natch), plus the Apple Scanner and Hewlett-Packard's ScanJet and ScanJetPlus.andM;Although most scanners are still being used as image-entry devices.andP;  OCR'ssuccess may change that.andP;  As the Egyptians found out, sometimes words aremore powerful than pictures.andM;Tester's ChoiceandM;For the best combination of price and performance, you can't go wrong witheither the Datacopy 730GS or Hewlett-Packard's ScanJet Plus.andP;  The 6-bitDatacopy ($1,995) is a compact machine with a superior gray range andexcellent halftones, making it a good choice for most desktop-publishingneeds.andP;  Datacopy's MacImage is the best scanning software we've seen; itcontains an impressive array of features for both prescan (customizabledither patterns, mixed line art) and postcan (gamma correction, printerhalftone control) maneuvers.andM;For $250 more, you can move up to the 8 bits (256 grays) of the ScanJet Plus.andO;This versatile machine offers excellent resolvability of text and line art,equally fine text extraction, and good halftone quality.andP;  Its scanner driver,DeskScan, is implemented as a DA,  which makes scanning from withinapplications easy.andP;  It has the only gray-scale preview and the best on-linehelp.andM;If you want 64 grays and hanker for more editing power, consider Microtek'sMSF-300QS ($1,995).andP;  Its driver is a plug-in module for Digital Darkroom andSuperPaint 2.0, both of which are bundled with the scanner.andP;  Although theMSF-300QS is not in the same league as the Datacopy and ScanJet Plusmachines, its features and the power of its bundled software make it worth alook.andM;If your primary need is OCR and you don't need the bells and whistles (orprices) of the 6- and 8-bit scanners, check out Abanton's Scan 300/S orDest's PC Scan 1000.andP;  The Scan 300/S ($1,795) had the highest scores on textextraction, and its driver, PanelScan, is a cdev, which means you can scanfrom within any program.andP;  The PC Scan 1000 ($1,750) provides good textextraction, and it has an optional sheet feeder and hardware-based OCRpackage, Text  Processor, for fast, high-volume OCR.andP;  The package priceincluding Text Processor is $2,250, a combination that might hard to beat.andM;For a simple plug-and-play scanner, a no-frills unit that's easy to learn,check out the standard-because-of-its-name Apple Scanner ($1,849).andP;  Sixteengrays don't provide high-quality halftones, but it's a solid, midrangescanner.andP;  Its Remote Scan button provides one-touch scanning; you can havetwo resolutions and scan modes in a single scan; you can scan irregularlyshaped areas; and HyperScan lets you scan images directly into HyperCard.andM;We really can't recommend the New Image MacScanPro ($2,495).andP;  It has somenice features -- its MacScan software can drive other scanners, and it doespostscan editing -- but we feel its lack of a preview scan is a crippingdefect.andM;Finally, there's our 400-dpi entrant, the AGFA Focus S800GS ($6,090).andP;  Itscombination of superior resolvability, excellent halftone quality, and goodtext extraction make it the publisher's dream machine, albeit a pricey one.andO;Its professional-quality software, MC Views Plus, provides excellent scancontrol and a variety of  postscan editing effects.andP;  We can't recommend it toeveryone, but if you do high-end DTP or are scanning highly detailed imagesthat require great precesion--say, aerial photos--the AGFA may be the scannerfor you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
