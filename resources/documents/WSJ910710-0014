Liberals, having lostcontrol of the Supreme Court after years of rewriting thelaw, now discover the value of abiding by precedent.Conservatives need to remind these newcomers to the issue ofstare decisis that the only binding constitutional precedentsare rulings that are indeed constitutional. No legalprinciple carves illegitimate rulings into stone.   The vision haunting judicial activists is Clarence Thomasadding to the new conservative majority to reverse cases theWarren Court decided without benefit of grounding in theConstitution. For the first time since the racist era'sPlessy v. Ferguson (1896), there is a long list of cases thatdeserve little or no respect as binding precedent becausethey were never &quot;legal&quot; decisions in any meaningful way.</LP><TEXT>   Some definitions are in order. Stare decisis -- standingby decided rulings -- is a technique developed over thecenturies in England to help judges keep the common law ofcontracts, torts and property moving along a steady andpredictable path. There would be chaos, for example, if laterjudges changed the arbitrary but certain rule that a contractis made once a letter accepting its terms is in the mailbox.   The role of precedent is different in cases interpreting awritten Constitution. Here, adherence to prior cases is atechnique for helping judges find the link joining theFounding Fathers to the most recent judges who searched tofind their original intent. But what happens when judges didnot reflect the original intent, when they felt free tosubstitute their own view of correct public policy for thetext and structure of the Constitution? Stare decisis is amethod for finding original intent; it would be a method ofmadness if it meant being bound by precedents that ignoredoriginal intent.   This is why activist judges and their apologists now fearpayback time. One of the last cases in which Justice ThurgoodMarshall participated is a sign of legal change to come. OverJustice Marshall's bitter dissent, six justices voted lastmonth in Payne v. Tennessee to allow witnesses andprosecutors in death-penalty cases to tell juries about theeffect of murders on the relatives of the victims. Thisreversed cases the court decided in 1987 and 1989, butreturned the law to where it was for the country's first 200years. As Justice Cardozo wrote in 1934, &quot;justice, though dueto the accused, is due to the accuser also.&quot;   The opinion includes a debate among the justices overwhich cases deserve full respect as precedent. In themajority opinion, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that&quot;stare decisis is not an inexorable command,&quot; especially inconstitutional cases, where legislators cannot pass laws tooverturn court decisions. &quot;Considerations in favor of staredecisis are at their acme in cases involving property andcontract rights, where reliance interests are involved,&quot; hewrote. Precedents count for much less in cases &quot;involvingprocedural and evidentiary rules,&quot; such as this victim-impactruling.   &quot;If there was ever a case that defied reason,&quot; JusticeAntonin Scalia wrote in a separate opinion, &quot;that hadabsolutely no basis in constitutional text, in historicalpractice or in logic,&quot; it was Booth v. Maryland, one of thecases that barred victim-impact statements. Stare decisis, hesaid, is part of &quot;a more general principle that the settledpractices and expectations of a democratic society shouldgenerally not be disturbed by the courts.&quot;   The earlier Booth decision, Justice Scalia wrote,&quot;announces a novel rule, contrary to long and unchallengedpractice and pronounces it to be the Law of the Land.&quot; It was&quot; Booth and not today's decision that compromised thefundamental values underlying the doctrine of stare decisis.&quot;Justice Scalia warned that &quot;what would enshrine power as thegoverning principle of this court is the notion that animportant constitutional decision with plainly inadequaterational support must be left in place for the sole reasonthat it once attracted five votes.&quot;   Justice Marshall's dissent warned that this case &quot;sends aclear signal that scores of established constitutionalliberties are now ripe for reconsideration.&quot; He listed 10&quot;endangered precedents&quot; under what he said was a &quot;newcriteria for overruling.&quot; Litigators should consult hisFootnote 2 for this guide to cases he thinks are ready foroverruling. His list includes the Garcia case (1985) thateviscerated federalism.   Despite Justice Marshall's reference to &quot;establishedconstitutional liberties,&quot; many opinions over the past 30years discovered rights that are clearly not in theConstitution. For example, Justice Marshall along with formerJustice William Brennan consistently wrote that the deathpenalty could never be constitutional, despite theConstitution's specific guidelines for the use of capitalpunishment.   The hypocrisy here is impressive, even given the feveredpolitics against a new conservative Supreme Court nominee. AsTerry Eastland's list on the opposite page shows, the heydayfor reversing earlier cases began with the Warren Court eraof unrestrained judicial activism. The infamous Miranda andexclusionary rule cases, for example, not only reversed prioropinions, they did so without any serious claim that the newrules reflected the original intent of the Founders.   Clarence Thomas has not written on stare decisis, but theliberal senators on the Judiciary Committee announced theirstare-decisis litmus test during Justice David Souter'shearings. This is that conservative judges are supposed tofollow precedents, no matter how unprincipled the earlierrulings, while liberal judges are free to ignore even themost firmly rooted constitutional precedents. This doublestandard would, not coincidentally, lock a leftward ratchetinto the law.   The liberal view of stare decisis was captured in aninfamous 24-hour precedent. On June 27, 1990, the U.S.Supreme Court ruled that Arizona's death penalty wasconstitutional. On June 28, the liberal justices tookadvantage of the fact that two conservative justices had torecuse themselves from a similar case and ruled that thestate's death penalty was suddenly unconstitutional. Theresult was that the murderer of reporter Don Bolles escapedexecution. Former California Chief Justice Rose Bird onceshowed her disdain for precedent by reversing a contract casethe U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1876 by announcing that&quot;the very longevity of this authority exposes its weakness.&quot;   When he is asked about stare decisis, Judge Thomas mightremind the senators of the importance of consistency, clarityand predictability in court rulings. He could also tell themthat when activist courts failed to abide by the Constitutionthey put all settled law at risk. In other words, sometimesreversing cases is the best tribute to the idea of bindingprecedents. Until the Supreme Court invalidates the excessesof earlier activist courts, we will not have a jurisprudencesafe for stare decisis.</TEXT></DOC>
