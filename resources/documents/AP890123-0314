A massive federal probe into possibly widespread corruption inthe Chicago futures markets has raised key parallels to the insidertrading crackdown that has tainted the New York-based securitiesindustry for more than two years, several lawyers and tradingexperts said Monday.   One of the most important resemblances, they said, was thestrong-arm intervention of the Justice Department into areas thathistorically has been supervised largely by the business itself.   ``I think every so often you've got to shake up the system,''said Howard Schneider, a former counsel to the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission, the federal regulatory body that oversees thefutures pits. ``This is a shakeup of the system. Hopefully theself-regulators will see this and do a better job.''   The investigation of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and ChicagoBoard of Trade, which first surfaced last week, included secret FBIplants disguised as floor traders, who taped conversations ofalleged wrongdoing.   At least 100 people were subpoenaed by the Chicago U.S.attorney's office in what has become the biggest fraud crackdown inthe history of the wild Chicago futures markets.   The use of stool pigeons, surveillance and the threat ofindictment and disgrace in the Chicago probe in some ways echoes thetactics used in late 1986 to expose a massive insider trading schemeon Wall Street.   Although it is too early to measure the outcome of the Chicagoinvestigation, legal experts said the government appears to berelying on shock value, secrecy and pressure on people to cooperateor face harsh penalties.   That is the same strategy used effectively by the Manhattan U.S.attorney's office to frighten many alleged wrongdoers _ notably theinfamous speculator Ivan Boesky and the ``junk bond'' securitiesgiant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. _ to cooperate in the insidertrading scandal,   ``The Justice Department wants to make a very strong statementnot just about Chicago and New York, but about the credibility ofthe marketplace,'' said Jack Barbanel, a futures strategist at theNew York investment firm Gruntal andamp; Co. ``It's a step beyond justleaving things with the SEC and CFTC.''   At the same time, the Chicago and New York crackdowns show markeddifferences that perhaps reflect the intrinsic contrasts of thefrenzied futures pits and the clubby, more subtle relationshipsamong stock traders.   For one thing, the alleged frauds in Chicago, which includedcheating customers and masking trading income, reportedly werebrazen acts committed on the exchange floors.   The New York scandal, on the other hand, involved crimescommitted via clandestine arrangements and ferreted out afterwardvia exhaustive research work and paper-trail hunting by SEC lawyersand federal prosecutors.   ``The Wall Street stuff was the type of conduct you don't geteyewitnesses to,'' said Ira Lee Sorkin, a former SEC administratorwho now practices securities law in New York.   ``Securities cases and corruption cases are done secretly,'' hesaid. ``They're not like bank robberies, with fingerprints andbloodstains and getaway cars. They're done among only those engagedin the conduct.''   Another key difference in the New York and Chicago scandalsappears to be the level of market involvement in each probe.   The New York Stock Exchange provided information about many ofthe key trades that federal investigators have used to piecetogether their insider trading prosecutions. In Chicago, marketofficials evidently knew little or nothing about the FBI probe intheir midst until it was exposed last week.   ``There's no such thing as courtesy in law enforcement,'' saidMichael Feldberg, a defense attorney and former federal prosecutorin Manhattan. ``Why should they let the exchanges know? When youhave an undercover in place, you try to get as much information asyou can until the game's over.''</TEXT></DOC>
