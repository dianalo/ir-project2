More than $1.06 billion would be cut from President Bush'srequest for accounts covering space, housing, veterans andthe environment, and the figures ensure continued pressure topare back the already troubled National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.</LP><TEXT>   Under siege in the House, NASA has embraced a proposalthat would freeze spending for an array of space scienceinitiatives in hopes of salvaging enough votes for a costly$30 billion space station. This amendment, which is favoredto pass in a floor vote today, gambles that more money can befound in the Senate, but the figures adopted yesterdayrepresent only a marginal change.   Compared with the budget used by the House Appropriationspanel, the Senate allocations promise only $50 million morein appropriations and just $20 million in direct spending forthe same mix of domestic accounts, including space.   Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D., Md.), who heads thesubcommittee overseeing NASA, said she couldn't predict ifthe station will be funded, and Utah Sen. Jake Garn, theranking Republican and a champion of space travel, warned ofa protracted stalemate between Congress and theadministration. &quot;The allocation is wrong,&quot; said the westernconservative, who has worked behind the scenes to involvePresident Bush in the fight. &quot;I believe it is unworkable.&quot;   Space station advocates, allied with a small army ofcorporate contractors and astronauts flown in to lobby, wereincreasingly confident last night of saving the project inthe House, but the tactics used in the confrontation couldhaunt NASA in the future. Leading science organizations arecritical of the agency's willingness to jeopardize otherspace initiatives, and having agreed to freeze its budget atcurrent fiscal 1991 levels, NASA may find it more difficultto argue for more money later.   The conflicts are most clearly embodied in Rep. GeorgeBrown (D., Calif.), the new House Science Committee chairmanwho is eager to work with NASA but has historically been achampion of the very space-science programs now in jeopardy.&quot;We are engaged in a political ploy to save the station,&quot; hesaid, &quot;and we're doing this because it is the only way toensure enough money for NASA so the science programs cancontinue in the future.&quot;   Critics argue in response that rather than help futurescience funding, the station will consume what limitedresources are available to NASA. The House AppropriationsCommittee, which denied funding for the station, added $465million elsewhere to current spending for scienceinitiatives, including the Craf-Cassini exploration projectand an ambitious system of Earth-observing satellites.   &quot;I'm appalled that NASA would risk these projects for thespace station,&quot; said Robert Park of the American PhysicalSociety. Such organizations as the American Geophysical Unionhave tried to activate their members to counter the lobbyingby major contractors.   More than a half-trillion dollars in domestic, foreign-aidand military spending is covered by the Senate committee'sallocations, which are the product of behind-the-scenesnegotiations over recent weeks. Though the space stationfight has received the most attention, the figures willdemand cuts as well in agriculture and natural-resourcesprograms, and the 5% increase for health and educationaccounts is substantially below the level promised in Houseand Senate budget resolutions this spring.   Mr. Byrd's imprint is most clearly seen in the emphasis oninfrastructure accounts, where he added $560 million to priorHouse allocations for energy and water and transportationappropriations. Much of the increase would go to publicworks, but within the Energy Department's defense accounts,the West Virginia Democrat also added $200 million more thanthe House to win support from Republicans with a stake inresearch at national laboratories in Western states.   Spending available for the Justice Department would beincreased by $310 million from the House, reflecting Mr.Byrd's commitment to anti-drug initiatives in the lastCongress and his more parochial pursuit of funds for afederal fingerprint facility in his home state. His sharpestcuts from the House allocations come in agriculture andrural-development accounts and could be the most sensitive.The same accounts are overseen by House Chairman JamieWhitten (D., Miss.), and the cuts add to the pressure for newuser fees to offset the costs of operating such agencies asthe Food and Drug Administration.</TEXT></DOC>
