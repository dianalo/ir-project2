GrossmanandM;EISA hardware manufacturers will strut their stuff next month at Comdex,where at least five EISA machines and more than a dozen EISA boards areexpected to make their debut, according to industry sources.andM;Hewlett-Packard Co. will start the ball rolling this week with theannouncement of a 486 tower-style system based on the Extended IndustryStandard Architecture (EISA), said sources close to the Sunnyvale, Calif.,andO;firm.andM;Ing.andP;  C. Olivetti andamp; Co. will follow next week with its own 486 tower-styleEISA system, a spokeswoman for the Italian company confirmed.andM;Compaq Computer Corp. is readying two 486 EISA PCs, at least one of which isexpected to be shown at Comdex, according to sources close to the company.andO;(See related story, Page 1.)andM;Other firms planning to unveil EISA computers at the trade show includeAdvanced Logic Research Inc. (ALR), AST Research Inc., NEC InformationSystems Inc. and Zenith Data Systems, sources close to those firms said.andM;ALR, not a member of the original EISA consortium, which is known as the Gangof Nine, became the first firm last month to announce an EISA PC, thePowerCache 4e.andM;Between 10 and 20 EISA-specific cards will be announced at Comdex, predictedGary Stimac, vice president of product engineering at Compaq in Houston.andM;Distributed Processing Technology Inc., Seagate Technology Inc., MaxtorCorp., Adaptec Inc., Quantum Corp. and Western Digital Corp. are among thefirms planning to display EISA controllers based on a new standard forperipheral interfaces, sources said.andM;Matrox Electronics Systems Ltd. hopes to demonstrate an EISA adapter for CADapplications, according to Ray Snow, marketing manager for the Quebec-basedfirm.andM;IDEAssociates Inc. is also expected to demonstrate EISA boards, according toa source close to the company.andM;Not all of the Gang of Nine will join in the Comdex EISA parade, however.andO;Officials at Epson America Inc., for example, said the Torrance, Calif., firmwill wait until mid-1990 to introduce an EISA machine because the existingIndustry Standard Architecture (ISA) is satisfactory for currentapplications.andM;&quot;There isn't much reason to own an EISA or a Micro Channel machine today,&quot;said Ed Juge, director of market planning for Tandy Corp., of Fort Worth,Texas.andM;Juge would not reveal Tandy's EISA plans, but said, &quot;the message that EISAavailability should send to the world is that there's nothing wrong with thecurrent standard.&quot;andM;Nevertheless, systems manufacturers are working closely with each other andwith board makers to provide compatibility with existing boards and software,said Richard Archuleta, director of advanced system development atHewlett-Packard.andM;&quot;We're all testing [EISA], and we all get together on the phone once a weekand talk about any problems,&quot; Archuleta said.andM;----------Additional reporting by Kristina B.
