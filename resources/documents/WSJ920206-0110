Corporate executives, directors and other insiders haveuntil Feb. 14 to comply with revamped Securities and ExchangeCommission regulations governing public disclosure of thestock options they have been given by their companies.</LP><TEXT>   To put teeth in the rules, the SEC has ordered that ifexecutives miss the approaching deadline, their companiesmust list the names of all tardy executives in the company'sproxy, or face a hefty fine. And some insider-trading expertssay that, at the slow pace corporate insiders are complyingwith the little-known new rules, it looks like there will bea lot of these embarrassing disclosures.   Stock option grants to executives often allow them to buystock at below-market prices and sell it soon after at a bigprofit. SEC filings disclosing these grants -- or anexecutive's failure to make those filings -- will beparticularly scrutinized this year because of the growingcontroversy over lavish executive pay at some companies.   &quot;Corporate gadflys are going to have a field day withthis,&quot; predicts Jesse M. Brill, a securities lawyer andeditor of the Corporate Executive newsletter. Stockholders&quot;upset about executive compensation may try to read somethinginto these failures to file.&quot;   Mr. Brill says the Feb. 14 deadline is likely to beignored by some of the estimated 10,000 companies that arecovered by the new filing rules. &quot;It's the very first year,and a lot of companies don't have their acts together yet,&quot;Mr. Brill says. &quot;Several hundred companies,&quot; he predicts,particularly smaller companies whose shares trade in theover-the-counter market, don't have the mechanisms set up togather this data from their insiders.   Most companies and individuals seem to be waiting untilthe last minute to file information about stock optionsgrants. &quot;We're expecting to see a big explosion soon,&quot; saidRobert Gabele, president of Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla.,company that compiles insider-trading data.   The filings are required because of new insider-tradingregulations that went into effect in May. To cut paperwork,the SEC exempted many corporate insiders from filing theirtrades in company stock every month, and reduced the filingrequirements for thousands of other executives.   For executives who still must report trades to the SEC,sales and purchases of company stock must be filed by the10th of the month following the trade.   But all stock option grants, gifts or inheritances ofcompany stock, or trades in pension plans and 401(k) plans,can now be filed just once a year, either by the company orthe insider on a &quot;Form 5.&quot; It's these filings that now mustbe made by Feb. 14 for insiders at all public companies whosefiscal years end Dec. 31.   For years, corporate insiders have routinely flouted SECfiling deadlines -- the delinquency rate in recent years hasrun at about 37%. So the agency added some bite to the newrules, says William McLucas, the SEC's director ofenforcement. Companies are required to disclose in theirproxy statement and their annual 10-K financial report thename of every officer, director and owner of more than 10% ofthe company's stock who didn't meet the Feb. 14 filingdeadline. And hefty fines could be levied against companieswhich show a pattern of failure to file.   The SEC now has the power to go to federal court torequest that insiders be fined a minimum of $5,000 for eachviolation of the filing deadline, $50,000 for &quot;recklessdisregard&quot; of the law, and $100,000 if there has been &quot;actualharm to the investment public and to the markets,&quot; says Mr.McLucas. Timeliness of the filings is important becauseinsider-trading data is &quot;material&quot; to investors when theydecide &quot;whether to buy or sell a stock,&quot; Mr. McLucas says.   Some of the Form 5 filings the SEC has already receivedare riddled with errors, says Invest/Net's Mr. Gabele. &quot;Toomany people are reporting transactions they already reportedearlier in the year,&quot; he says. That means insider filings mayappear to overstate insider buying and selling at companies.</TEXT></DOC>
