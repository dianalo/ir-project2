Rustin (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR CMD NDX </IN><G> SEC CFT </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission's report on the October stock-market crash called for across-the-board tinkering with market regulation, but it may be more significant for what it omits.    The report urged better market-surveillance systems and tougher capital rules for specialists and broker-dealers. It also recommended that performance standards for specialists be set and that margin levels in the futures markets be reviewed.    According to the report, the SEC staff found no evidence of manipulation of the Major Markets Index futures during the crash. The report opposed price limits on stocks and stock-index futures, and said the exchanges' specialist system doesn't need to be overhauled.    However, the 400-page report ignored the Brady task force's recommendation that an overarching body be created to oversee intermarket regulation.    The report, reviewed but not necessarily endorsed by the SEC's five commissioners, said the 15 largest Wall Street firms had a total pretax loss in October of almost $700 million. In addition, it said that apparent instances of intermarket front-running &quot;raise significant concerns.&quot; In front-running, an investor or firm uses advance knowledge of developments in one stock or futures market to trade in another.    Taking a far narrower view of the markets than the Brady task force did in its own report, released last month, the SEC bores in on several relatively narrow issues. The presidential task force had concluded, for example, that &quot;the financial system approached breakdown&quot; Oct. 20. Much of the SEC report, by contrast, addresses questions such as restrictions on short sales and corporate stock buy-backs.    The SEC staff expressed concern that there is &quot;potential for a major financial firm failure&quot; in such nonsecurities activities as &quot;bridge&quot; loans to help finance takeovers.    Several major investment banking houses have committed their own capital for such temporary financing. Typically, a firm then underwrites debt securities in the name of the company doing the takeover. Proceeds of the debt issue are used to repay the investment banking firm's loan.    However, the report said that as a result of the crash, the ability of securities firms to market such debt instruments &quot;was temporarily reduced,&quot; demonstrating &quot;the potential exposure from unregulated financing activity.&quot; The staff urged the commission to study the matter because &quot;significant failures . . . could affect investors and financial firms.&quot;    The report also said the SEC's staff &quot;found no evidence of manipulation&quot; of Major Market Index futures on the Chicago Board of Trade on Oct. 20. In November, The Wall Street Journal reported allegations by some market participants that the MMI may have been manipulated to drive up stock prices.    The SEC report said that &quot;neither the futures trading data and reports provided by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the CBT, nor the trading data compiled by the SEC's division of market regulation, provide evidence to support allegations of manipulation of MMI futures between 12:00 and 1:00 on Oct. 20.&quot;    The report added that a review by the SEC staff of CFTC and Board of Trade surveillance information &quot;indicates that buying activity in the MMI futures was not unusually concentrated in any one entity; nor were purchases effected for the proprietary accounts of any major registered securities broker-dealer.&quot;    The SEC report added that its finding was reinforced by a review of index-related trading on the New York Stock Exchange in the same time period.    Referring to a Jan. 7 Wall Street Journal story, the SEC report said that &quot;there also have been press accounts that question the integrity of the trading data supplied to the CFTC.&quot; The report said it reviewed the CFTC data, and indicated it was satisfied that they were accurate.    But the report did express concern over a cross-market trading abuse, intermarket front-running. It said some of the trading reviewed by the SEC raised &quot;troubling questions.&quot; It also said that stock, options and futures exchanges should carefully review &quot;potential front-running transactions&quot; by their member firms.    In addition, the report said the exchanges should improve their surveillance programs &quot;to detect, on a routine basis, suspicious trading activity that may indicate manipulation or front-running.&quot;    The report came out strongly for a method in which exchanges could rate a specialist's performance in relation to other specialists. It said that the SEC has urged the Big Board to adopt such a system, but that the exchange demurred because &quot;it believes that relative standards may punish a specialist whose performance is not necessarily unsatisfactory.&quot;    However, the report said the findings of the staff and the Brady commission &quot;underscore the need for relative measures.&quot; Both studies, the report said, &quot;found a wide disparity in specialist performance&quot; during the crash. Lower-rated specialists should have their performance reviewed and, if necessary, certain of their stocks should be reallocated to others, the report said.    In another area, the report urged tougher capital rules for all types of firms, and suggested certain methods to bolster specialists' capital.    For example, the SEC staff urged the commission to review the adequacy of the current $100,000 net capital requirement for over-the-counter market makers. And it urged the commission to explore a &quot;flexible&quot; system in which specialists would be required to put up more capital when making markets in volatile stocks.    To bolster specialists' capital, the SEC staff suggested that wherever possible, such firms have bank lines of credit that can be tapped in emergencies. If a specialist can't arrange such a line, exchanges should consider tighter capital requirements on the firm, the report said.    The report also said another approach could be the creation of &quot;a private emergency fund&quot; to support specialists in volatile markets. The idea, which had been broached in Washington and on Wall Street, could be controversial. Some Wall Streeters say it could be considered a bailout for specialists, who never have attracted much sympathy because they generally make huge profits during bull markets.    The SEC acknowledged that there are several unanswered questions about how such &quot;a safety net&quot; for specialists would be financed. The money could come from exchange members, from investors through a surcharge on trades, or from companies whose shares are traded on exchanges, the report said.    However, some companies, still smarting from the handling of their stocks by certain specialists during the crash, could be expected to vigorously oppose any assessments on them.    In reviewing the specialists' performance, the report recommended that the SEC and the exchanges look into improving the systems that monitor specialist activity. And the report concluded that simply increasing the specialists' capital wouldn't provide sufficient liquidity &quot;under present trading conditions&quot; created by computerized trading strategies.    It recommended that to alleviate the impact on specialists of the blizzards of trades set off by program trading, a new specialist's post be set up on the New York Stock Exchange to handle the &quot;baskets&quot; of stocks traded by program traders.    The report conceded that any specialist making a market in a basket of stocks such as the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 would need to be &quot;extremely well-capitalized.&quot; Nonetheless, it argued that &quot;the concept of basket trading warrants consideration.&quot;    Another step the report recommended to help the market adjust to program trading is more accurate and timely reporting of program trades.    The report is also critical of the performance of the routing and execution systems of some of the regional exchanges, a topic that has received little attention until now.    Singling out the Pacific and Philadelphia exchanges for &quot;serious problems&quot; with their systems, the report suggested that the SEC consider requesting that the two exchanges refrain from adding firms to their systems until they have improved the capacities of those systems.    In San Francisco, the Pacific Stock Exchange said it has completed modifications to its automated trading system that were undertaken in direct response to problems associated with the Oct. 19 crash.    That system can now handle as many as 50,000 trades a day, double its previous capacity. &quot;At the peak of the October crash, we had about 47,000 trades,&quot; thus the exchange believes the system, even with new clients, can handle loads associated with the heaviest trading days, a spokesman said.    In Philadelphia, Nicholas A. Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, called certain conclusions of the SEC study &quot;unfair and unfounded.&quot;    He said problems identified in the report &quot;have already been solved.&quot; For example, he said trade reporting problems cited in the report were corrected Oct. 22. Mr. Giordano said the capacity of the exchange's automated trading system was &quot;nearly twice&quot; the 10,000 daily orders ascribed to it by the SEC for last October &quot;and has been further increased since.&quot;    On Jan. 6, he said, the exchange began an expansion of its automated trading systems that will boost capacity to 40,000 orders a day by the end of 1988.    ---   SEC Report Highlights   --Recommends better market surveillance, tougher capital rules for securities firms, performance standards for specialists and a review of margin levels for futures.    --Opposes price limits on stocks and stock-index futures, and an overhaul of the specialist system.    --Doesn't address the question of a single regulatory body for all financial markets.    --Expresses concern that takeover-related bridge loans could result in firm failures. </TEXT></DOC>
