 The host pauses, then tears openthe envelope.andP;  Applause.andP;  The year's biggest star walks to the podium with aproducer on each arm.andP;  One producerandM;is tall, dark, and handsome.andP;   The other is small, beige, and has aandM;handle; it's a compaq Portable 386.andM;It's not as far-fetched as it sounds.andP;  In the past five years, supportingroles of PCs have grown at an astonishing rate.andP;  Currently, the PC assists inplaying, composing, and producing everything from pop music to movie soundtracks.andM;The PC has fine-tuned the music industry in three ways.andP;  Computerizedsynthesizers and digital samplers, devices that can record and alter thequalities of any sound, allow artists to produce customized tones, pitches,and timbres to suit a particular situation.andP;  Computer-driven sequencers helparrange, compose, and produce music with greater ease.andP;  Programs cansynchronize audiotape with visual images, translate music into notes onpaper, and even indulge in the artistically controversial practice ofalgorithmic composition, which uses the computer's logic capabilities tocreate new works of music.andM;For better or worse, when you hear a tune these days, it's a good bet thatsome part of it has seen the inside of a PC.andP;  This means that the music wehear today is different from what we heard ten or even five years ago.andP;  Someof the differences are easy to hear; others exist more in the process than inthe product.andM;Designer SoundandM;Listen to the background music in a current.andP;  Hollywood film or an hour'sworth of TV commercials and you'll realize that strings, horns, and drums areonly part of a musician's arsenal of sounds these days.andP;  Computer technologyis supplementing or even replacing traditional instruments with sounds youwon't find in any orchestra.andM;Digital samplers are instruments built around microprocessors that candigitally record (or sample) any sound, then let a musician play it back fromthe sampler's piano-type keyboard in a full range of pitches.andM;When samplers first hit the street, a wail arose from those charging thatpretenders to musical royalty were sampling notes from records and stealingthe unique sounds of the world's finest instrumentalists.andP;  Current attitudestoward sampling take a more positive view of the technology's capabilities.andO;Quincy Jones, the producer for such top artists as Michael Jackson, was askedhow he felt about people sampling sounds from Jackson's records.andP;  Jonesreportedly answered: &quot;Let 'em sample the records.andP;  They can't sampleMichael.&quot;andP;  In fact, it's easier and cheaper to hire Isaac Stern to play onyour record than to sample  his notes and try to play the sampler the wayStern plays the violin.andM;Rather than attempting to snatch another musician's sound outright, peoplewith samplers and the right software tend to specialize in custom-designingnew and unusual sounds for specific applications.andM;Los Angeles-based Jeff Rona is a professional sound designer who works with aroomful of synthesizers, samplers, and a Macintosh, creating sounds for newcompositions, especially film scores.andP;  He recently completed a project forcomposer Philip Glass's score for the film Powaqqatsi.andP;  A sound crew followedthe camera crew and sampled noises on location: voices, machines, naturalsounds, and so on.andP;  Using the sampler, rona turned ambient sounds from theoriginal setting into music for the film's score.andM;&quot;I sampled the sound of a train that appears in one scene, then altered thelength and color of the sound in subtle ways,&quot; says Rona.andP;  &quot;We played themodified 'ka-chunk' of the train along with a drum in the sound track; youcan actually hear the train sound playing a drum pattern.&quot;andM;Rona develops sounds to convey the feel of the composer's music or tocomplement the film's action.andP;  His first step is to use librarian programs tolist the synthesizer sounds he already has and to load chosen sounds into hissynthesizers to check their suitability.andP;  This saves invaluable time.andP;  &quot;It'slike using a database that makes noise,&quot; says Rona.andP;  &quot;I even wrote aHyperCard librarian for my sampler; I just click and it lists the names ofall my sampler sounds by name and type.&quot;andM;If nothing sounds right, he boots an editor program that uses screen graphicsto develop completely new sounds.andP;  For the Chuck Norris  film Hero and theTerror, Rona sampled the voices of the composer and music editor pronouncingnonsense syllables: &quot;oo,&quot;andM;&quot;cha,&quot; and so forth.andP;   &quot;I spliced, reversed, and cross-faded littleandM;bits of them together to create these weird, alienish sounds that we playedas one of the instruments in the score,&quot; Rona explains.andP;  &quot;They became kind oda leitmotif, a 'soloist' who played whenever the monster was in the area.&quot;andM;Whether it is sampling great musicians or the great outdoors, the personalcomputer is a star on the rise.andP;  &quot;I could never process this material in sosophisticated a way without the computer,&quot; says Rona.andP;  &quot;It's really apowerful extension of the musical instruments.&quot;andM;But while the PC helps expand the universe of musical sounds, these soundsstill need to be arranged into music.andM;Getting the Notes RightandM;A sequencer is a kind of multitrack tape recorder in a computer, used forengineering sounds into music.andP;  You can buy a hardware sequencer--a boxhousing a computer dedicated to just that job.andP;  But software versions tend tobe more powerful by virtue of the PC's greater memory, more detailedinterface, hard disk storage potential, and  comparative ease of upgrading.andM;Sequencers use a standardized language known as the Musical InstrumentDigital Interface (MIDI), which allows them to talk to electronic musicalinstruments such as synthesizers, samplers, and drum machines.andP;  A PC loadedwith one of the two dozen or so available sequencing programs records thedata generated by someone playing a MIDI-equipped instrument.andP;  The sequencercan send the data back to the instrument on demand, making it play an almostexact duplicate  of the original performance, like a player piano.andP;  Andsequencer software turns a PC into a workstation on which you can shape,manipulate,  and otherwise edit music, much as a word processor massagestext.andM;Sequencers first caught the public's ear in the mid-1970s, and right awaythey stirred aesthetic controversy.andP;  The first sequencers had such crudetempo resolution that everything they played back sounded mechanical andstiff, lacking the rhythmic subtleties--the &quot;feel&quot;--a musician normally giveseven the most precise performance.andP;  Despite  complaints from thetradition-bound, creative bands such as a Kraftwerk and Devo felt that musicin our computerized world ought to sound this way.andP;  They pioneered a popularnew style, techno-pop, characterized by strings of precise, repeating,mechanically even sixteenth notes.andM;Sequenced music gained further acceptance as Madison Avenue moved techno-popinto the mainstream with computerized sound-tracks for advertisements.andP;  Thenext time you see a television commercial in which Ford's latest beauty comesroaring out of the distance, tracking the curves like a German racing demon,listen to the musical underlay.andP;  You'll hear that &quot;dit-dit-dit-dit&quot;techno-pop rhythm and you'll feel the high-tech power of the car.andP;  and so itgoes: limitation becomes signature.andP;  We no longer even think of mechanicalrhythms as bad music--just as a certain kind of music.andM;Meanwhile, developers have produced more powerful and flexible programs;today's sequencers are no longer limited to reproducing jackhammer rhythms.andO;Sequencers don't think in sixteenth, thirty-second, or even sixty-fourthnotes.andP;  They subdivide each beat into as many as 600 parts and can accuratelyrecord and play back incredibly subtle rhythmic nuances of a performance.andO;They will &quot;auto-correct&quot; the placement of notes in time with complexalgorithms that move the notes just far enough to sound tight, but notinhuman, and even allow a whole performance to be shifted forward or back intime be mere milliseconds to get the feel just right.andM;The New ComposerandM;Sequencers have been a boon to struggling musicians.andP;  Small bands will, forexample, sequence the drum and bass parts of a whole night's worth of musicbeforehand, then put two people onstage playing the lead parts while thesequencer plays the background.andP;  Though some musicians worry about reactionsto canned music, listeners seem not to wonder how a two-man band can soundlike a small orchestra.andM;But sequencers have an even bigger impact on music composers.andP;  Unlike itsanalog forebear, the tape deck, the sequencer records music ineasy-to-manipulate digital form.andP;  Once a line is recorded, themusician/composer can copy, transpose, or delete the data, shift its pitch orits position in time, change its tempo or volume, have it play a differentsound on the synthesizer, or play a different instrument entirely.andM;Musicians whose great ideas outstrip their skills for playing individualinstruments can record their music at a slow, easy tempo and then speedthings up on playback, or record lines of a passage one at a time, then playthem back all together.andP;  Musicians or composers with a sequencer and ahandful of synthesizers at home can hear a work as it progresses; thay canrecord bass, drum, horn, and piano parts one at a time, then play everythingback and tweak until perfect--without spending valuable studio time.andM;The uses of sequencers are as varied as the musicians who use them.andP;  To helphim write songs, Stevie Wonder carries a Compaq 386 wherever he goes.andO;According to Rob Arbittire, who writes &quot;nonvisual  software&quot; for themusician, wonder uses a Versabraille--a small pad that delivers computeroutput in braille form--and customized software that communicates with beepsand clicks.andP;  Wonder uses the sequencer Texture 2, which is particularlysuitable &quot;its user interface and keystrokes are laid out so that you're notrequired to look at the screen,&quot; says Arbittire.andM;According to Arbittire, Wonder typically writes by first sequencing, say, 16bars of a bass pattern.andP;  With that bass line playing in the background, he'llelectronically transform the keyboard into another instrument, such as anelectrin piano, and jam.andP;  Then the master songsmith can play everything back,pick and choose while he listens, and keep adding parts.andP;  Because the Textureprogram records in discrete sections, or patterns, of any length, Wonder isfree to arrange and rearrange sections of the song until he finds what helikes.andM;Sequencing HeatandM;Some of the most innovative PC music-making, however, is happening outsidethe record studios.andP;  In 1984, keyboardist/composer Jan Hammer, formerly ofthe Mahavishnu Orchestra, a rock instrumental group, got a gig scoring a newTV show called &quot;Miami Vice.&quot;andP;  His advanced sounds and sequencer-basedtechniques put the state of the art into America's living rooms and radicallychanged the way TV shows and movies are scored.andM;Hammer computer-locks a videotape of the episode he is scoring to hissequencer and audiotape deck.andP;  While watching the video, he plays hisinstruments--a drum part, a piano melody, or maybe just a rhythm figure--intohis sequencer.andP;  Then he can play back the sequence and modify tempo,orchestration, and so on.andP;  The result is a score composed directly to theonscreen action, accompanying it the way a good pianist follows a singer.andO;Within months of the debut of &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; many other new shows were copyingHammer's style and techniques.andM;Hammer uses an IBM PC-XT, a Macintosh Plus, and a Commodore 64 for everythingfrom sequncing to automating his mixing console.andP;  &quot;I can organize mythoughts, like on a word processor.andP;  Before, if I wanted to record a piece ofmusic and hear it, I had to tape it and splies different pieces of tapetogether--a very time-consuming process.andP;  Here it's instantaneous; I canaudition different themes and musical ideas and hear how they fit together.andO;I can try anything.&quot;andM;Computers don't make his music better or worse, Hammer says, just appropriatefor the era we live in: &quot;In the 1700s, when the piano was being perfected,the music sounded a certain way, which was different from the music 100 yearsbefore that.andP;  Technology can't help but shape what the artist does--and thecreative tools today are computers.&quot;andM;The Home StudioandM;This ability to edit a sequenced performance to perfection has introduced theconcept of &quot;preproduction&quot; and has made recording cheaper.andP;  The perils oftaking a band to a costly studio have been diminished enormously.andP;  Compose,sequence, and edit on your home computer, then take a floppy disk to thehigh-priced studio with the world-class synthesizers.andP;  Pop your disk into thestudio's computer and fret no more about uncooperative musicians, misplayedparts, or costly studio overtime.andP;  Just lay your sequence to tape, and hey,man, it's rock and roll.andM;If this sounds a bit lacking in social and human interaction, it is.andO;Sequenced tracks don't have the same dynamics as a good jam session.andP;  Butthen, hardly anyone has rcorded a whole band playing together at once sincemultitrack tape decks took over in the late 1960s.andP;  Still, a PC offers anadvantage:  a musician can capture h is best effort and then integrate itinto a composition with keystrokes or mouse clicks.andM;Musicians also use PCs to print what they play.andP;  William Goldstein, who wrotethe music for the TV show &quot;Fame&quot; as well as for such Hollywood films asShelley Long's Hello Again and Chuck Norris's An Eye for an Eye, uses a 386clone with Windows and a program from Ronald called MESA that does sequencingand produces a score in standard music notation.andP;  MESA gives Goldstein thedual compositional luxury of hearing his work played on his synthesizers atany point during its creation and seeing it written out, which gives him anoverview.andM;For works that will be recorded by live musicians, PC programs such asTemporai Acuity's Music Printer Plus allow a composer to write a piece on acomputer using traditional notation, and then extract and print individualparts for each musician.andP;  That saves considerable time and expense when thecomposer is ready to record.andM;Automated CreativityandM;The musical competerphobe's nightmare was perhaps best played out in theHerbert Goldstone short story, &quot;Virtuoso,&quot; in which a celebrated maestrodiscovers his new robot seated at the piano, playing Beethoven's Appassionatato perfection: &quot;creating it, breathing, it,&quot; causing  the maestro to weep.andO;&quot;Music,&quot; the character says, &quot;I may have heard it that way in my soul; I knowBeethoven did.&quot;andM;While the maestro rebounds immediately with a plan to make a few bucks offhis android protege, the reader is left with a strong image of a robotevoking passion and tears by sheet music, as he says, into &quot;my store ofdata.&quot;andM;Of all the faces of music's computerization, the one that most stronglyechoes the aesthetic discord of &quot;Virtuoso&quot; is that of algorithmiccomposition: music arising not from the human soul but from an arithmeticlogic unit.andM;Two kinds of algorithmic composers are in general use: one generates melodiesfrom random patterns constrained in certain ways by the user, the other bysupplying endless variations to a musical phrase the user plays into thecomputer.andP;  Both Jan Hammer and Jeff Rona use these programs; neither feelsthis makes a composition less his own.andM;&quot;I don't use [the algorithmic composer program] to write a whole piece,&quot; saysHammer.andP;  &quot;I lay out certain parameters--tonality, key, number of chordchanges, and so on--let the program run, and it comes up with variations ofmelodies that work within those parameters.andP;  Then I edit the ones I like andcombine with whatever I'm working on.andP;  It's only one layer in a many-layeredprocess.&quot;andM;Rona works extensively with Intelligent Music's Jam Factory, which he usesfor clues on different directions in which to take his music.andP;  &quot;I play aphrase on my MIDI keyboard, this goes to the Mac, and the software starts toplay back variations.andP;  When I hear something that points me in a newdirection, I'll load it into my sequencer and edit it until it fits the pieceI'm writing.andP;  It's a great way to get out of a corner.&quot;andM;CodaandM;The personal computer has found a home in the music world.andP;  It records,organizes, prompts, and calculates, just as it does in the office or thelaboratory.andM;But its presence in the arts raises some eyebrows.andP;  Will music become&quot;computerized&quot; and soulless?andP;  Could the PC provide musical careers for peoplewho otherwise wouldn't have cut it?andM;Clearly, someone who hasn't spent 20 years playing the violin can now use aneditor program to work up a hot sound on a synthesizer.andP;  A person lackingformal compositional training who has only a modicum of instrumental skillsnow can enter and edit music in a sequencer and, perhaps with some help froman algorithmic note generator, develop this into a composition.andP;  Likewise,the disabled--the blind, or  those physically unable to master a traditionalinstrument--can follow the example of Stevie Wonder, or of Teddy Pendergrass,the singer and composer who was seriously disabled in a car crash but todayuses an extensive computer system to help him continue to make records.andM;The computer helps us touch the muse; it's wonderful tool for getting themusic out of our heads and into the air.andP;  Like any instrument,  it overcomesbarriers and helps turn ideas into reality.andM;But the main ingredients are still inspiration.andP;  If no human conceives amusical idea and infuses it with shape, meaning, judgment, and labor, thenthere is no music.andP;  The algorithmic composer or random note generator soundslike what it is: a random compilation of noise.andP;  If the world at large comesto accept randomly played notes, without the structure and direction of humanwill, then we will have created the ultimate in least-common-denominatorculture, and the instrument will be the artist.andP;  But the choice of how we useour tools is always our own.andP;  To borrow an expression from the politicalworld:  we deserve the music we get.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
