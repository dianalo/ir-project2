(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic Party chief Ronald Browncalled on Republican counterpart Lee Atwater on Friday to join himin writing an ethics code to steer politicians away from dirtycampaigning.   Atwater said Brown should join him in supporting a proposalPresident Bush will soon send to Congress.   ``American politics is in trouble,'' said Brown, who wasattending the Association of Democratic Chairs summer meeting.``Voters are sick and tired of attacks, dirty tricks, phony phonebanks and rumor mongers.''   Brown said he sent an invitation to Atwater asking for a meetingas soon as possible.   ``I believe the two major parties can make a difference bysetting new standards of conduct in the profession of politics,'' hesaid.   Atwater, in a statement issued in Washington, did not referdirectly to Brown's call for a campaign code but said he wouldconsider meeting with him if the Democratic chairman endorsed acampaign reform proposal Bush is preparing to send to Congress.   ``The best thing Ron Brown and I can do is to work with ourrespective congressional delegations for quick passage of thislegislation,'' Atwater said. Democrats, however, are working on acampaign reform package of their own.   Atwater also said he would like any such meeting with Brown toinclude discussion of rules for congressional redistricting to takeplace following the 1990 census. Both parties are spending heavilytrying to gain control of legislatures that will redrawcongressional districts in states that lose or gain seats inCongress because of population shifts.   The indirect exchange between the party chairman came a weekafter Brown called for Atwater's resignation because of a RepublicanNational Committee memo attacking new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.   The memo compared Foley's record with that of Rep. Barney Frank,D-Mass., who is homosexual.   Mark Goodin, who sent the memo, resigned as RNC communicationsdirector and said Atwater did not see the document in advance of itsdistribution.   On Friday, Brown stood by his suggestion that Atwater resign butsaid he also believed it important for the party chairmen to discusscampaign conduct.   Brown also said, ``President Bush has to step up and lead histroops. His troops are out of control. The Republican Partyleadership has become the princes of dirty politics, dirty practicesand negative campaigning.''   He declined to say exactly which issues should be addressed inhis proposed campaign code but said a non-partisan group probablywould be needed to enforce any such guidelines.</TEXT></DOC>
