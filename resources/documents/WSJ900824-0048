The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesconfirmed that Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister andOPEC president, invited his fellow ministers to the Austriancapital to talk about possible responses to the recent lossof Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes from world markets.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are going to be consultations among some ministersSunday,&quot; a spokesman for OPEC said at its Viennaheadquarters, &quot;but we are not calling it a meeting.&quot;   Whatever it's called, the session is likely to be theclosest thing yet to the OPEC &quot;blessing&quot; that some countrieswith spare capacity have sought for their pledges to producemore oil. These countries have been turned down in a requestfor an emergency meeting of OPEC to endorse higher outputquotas.   &quot;This is a very unusual procedure,&quot; said a senior OPECdelegate from one of the countries, &quot;but let's hope itworks.&quot;   Although the promised production increases are slowlybeginning, world oil prices continue to surge. Yesterday,crude oil jumped by $1.50 to $4 a barrel, pushing more crudesbeyond $30, and fuels rose as much as six cents a gallon.   In U.S. oil fields, some refiners now are posting pricesas high as $30.75 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark crude. In U.S. futures trading, the October crudecontract rose 71 cents to $31.93 a barrel yesterday, whileunleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 4.44 cents tonearly $1.09 a gallon.   Crude oil prices now are more than double their levels asrecently as June. To calm the volatile markets, Venezuela andSaudi Arabia had been pressing for an emergency OPEC meetingto act on quotas and production levels.   That request was rejected Monday. Still, the two countrieshave begun to increase output toward a promised total ofabout 2.5 million barrels a day, with the bulk of it comingfrom Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates could produce anadditional 500,000 barrels a day. This would replacethree-fourths of the four million barrels a day of Iraqi andKuwaiti crudes removed from world markets as a result ofIraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.   It isn't clear whether all 13 member nations will haverepresentatives at the Vienna talks. Nor is it known whetheranyone will represent Kuwait, which remains occupied by Iraqitroops.   As of late yesterday, only six ministers had confirmedthey plan to attend, OPEC sources said. They are fromAlgeria, Venezuela, Indonesia, Nigeria, Gabon and Iran.   In Caracas, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez saidseven nations -- the majority required to call a specialmeeting of all 13 -- had agreed to be in Vienna for the&quot;consultative session&quot; on possible oil production increases.He didn't list the seven.   The OPEC ministers cannot take official action unless theyare in a regular or special conference. But Celestino Armas,the Venezuelan oil minister, said Venezuela's view is thatthe ministerial majority expected in Vienna could turn thetalks into an emergency session at which decisions could bemade. He told the Venezuelan Congress that the national oilcompanies already have begun pumping more, with an extra350,000 barrels a day targeted that will be stored foreventual sale abroad.   Venezuela has been coordinating its efforts with those ofSaudi Arabia for several weeks. But the attendance of SaudiArabia in Vienna is a question mark. Hisham Nazer, the Saudioil minister, has been critical of the lack of any officialOPEC response to threatened shortages and volatile oilmarkets.   Yesterday, a person close to Saudi oil policies cited twoobjections to &quot;this so-called meeting&quot; in Vienna. There wasno formal invitation to the oil ministers from Mr. Boussena,he said, and there is no agenda. &quot;What we have here is aninvitation to a Sunday barbecue party,&quot; he said.   Others suggested, however, that the Saudis can hardlyafford to ignore the talks. &quot;The only thing I can see{developing at Vienna} is that Venezuela, Saudi Arabia andthe Emirates will be given some kind of blessing to producemore,&quot; one senior OPEC delegate said.</TEXT></DOC>
