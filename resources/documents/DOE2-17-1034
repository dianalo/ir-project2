A pilot study was setup to investigate the feasibility of such a method, and the possibilityof using the measurements as an index of cumulative inhalation of radonand daughters. Three 12.5 cm diameter phoswich detectors were installedinside a lead brick enclosure in a mobile laboratory, and taken to twodifferent mines, where a total of 40 subjects was measured. No {sup 210}Pbwas detected in any of the subjects, but the level of detection was notlow enough for this result to be of great significance. This was dueto the high background counts in the areas of the surveys, and the inadequacyof the transportable shielding. Contamination of the miners with short-liveddaughter products was also a problem. It is concluded that the methodis useful only in a steel room when sufficient time has elapsed for thisshort-lived contamination to have disappeared. It is suggested that measurementof blood samples may be suitable as a monitoring or screening test.</TEXT></DOC>
