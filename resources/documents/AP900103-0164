AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of people shouting ``NoMore!'' and ``Assassin!'' marched Wednesday to the Vatican Embassy,where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was closeted with a broken TVwhile his fate was being negotiated.   A crowd estimated at 20,000 filled five blocks of Avenida Balboaleading to the embassy. U.S. soldiers and tanks at checkpoints keptthe crowd 150 yards from the embassy gates.   Noriega was said to be in ``strict isolation'' after MonsignorSebastian Laboa, the papal nuncio, told his staff not to speak tothe ousted dictator. An embassy spokesman said the television setin the room was broken.   Panamanian sources said the U.S. Southern Command was trying toconvince Noriega's longtime mistress to try to lure Noriega out theembassy.   But the sources, who asked not to be further identified, saidVicky Amado talked to Noriega for 10 minutes after her release froma U.S. military facility Tuesday and told the deposed strongman:``The decision is in your hands.''   In Washington, the Bush administration said after DeputySecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger met with Panama's newleaders that letting Noriega go to a third country was an option.   Later Wednesday however Eagleburger said U.S. policy thatNoriega should be sent to Florida to face drug trafficking chargesrather than to a third country had not changed.   ``We want Noriega in the United States. Period,'' he said.   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Panama's constitution didnot permit the general's extradition to the United States. TheVatican has said it would not deliver Noriega directly to theUnited States and would deal with Panama.   Linares threatened to break diplomatic relations with Cuba andNicaragua, which he said ``were allies of Noriega's militarydictatorship'' and had made statements that ``besmirch the goodname of Panama.''   ``If they continue to harass Panama, we will be forced to reviewour relations with them,'' he said. ``There is a strong opinion inPanama that there should be a break in relations.''   Problems appeared in President Guillermo Endara's newadministration. Col. Roberto Armijo, who had been Noriega's policechief, quit as head of the newly created public safety forces.   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said the resignation hadnothing to do with ``relations between the government and thepublic safety forces.''   Arias said Armijo stepped down after a ``financial matter thatdeserves an investigation'' was discovered. He did not elaborate,but said the investigation was under way.   One demonstrator in the Avenida Balboa crowd held a sign thatread ``No Mercy'' in six languages. Speakers went to a platform andshouted ``No more! No more!''   Vendors sold T-shirts that had ``I survived the U.S. invasion''on the front and the operation's code name ``Just Cause'' in theback. The demonstrators dispersed without incident at nightfall.   Vatican Embassy spokesman Jose Cubillas said two Noriega aideswere ``very nervous'' about the military activity around thecompound, which is ringed by barbed wire and dozens of U.S.soldiers.   Seventeen others are believed to have joined Noriega in theVatican Embassy, including Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, director ofhis secret police, and Capt. Eliezer Gaytan, chief of his personalsecurity force.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said theBush administration was sticking to its position that Noriega bedelivered to U.S. authorities to face drug trafficking charges, butadded: ``We will not rule out any and every other kind of option.''   Officials said Eagleburger had no direct role in negotitions toget Noriega out of the embassy, where he has been closeted for 10days, but his visit came while a Vatican envoy was in Panama tohelp with the negotiations   A delegation led by Eagleburger met with Endara and other newPanamanian leaders Wednesday to plan American help for economicrecovery.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the committee's rankingminority member, were in Panama to evaluate the U.S. operation.   Linares said ``Panama cannot constitutionally and juridically''extradite Noriega to the United States, even though Endara andothers have said they would prefer Noriega go there rather than toa third country where he could make trouble.   Armijo was replaced as head of the new security forces by Lt.Col. Eduardo Herrera, who was military attache in Israel at thetime of the U.S. invasion Dec. 20.   In an interview Tuesday, Armijo said many of Noriega's henchmenhad eluded capture and had sought asylum in the Vatican and otherembassies.   Unexpectedly heavy fighting between pro-Noriega forces and U.S.troops heavily damaged many parts of Panama City, once a thrivingcommercial and financial hub of 1 million. Looter plunderedhundreds of stores of merchandise ranging from food to furniture.   Eagleburger was traveling with acting Secretary of the TreasuryJohn Robson and by Mark Edelman, acting director of the U.S. Agencyfor International Development. His visit coincided with a trip byMonsignor Giacinto Berloco, a Vatican diplomat and Latin Americanspecialist.</TEXT></DOC>
