Ali Khalifa al-Sabah told reporters Kuwait has temporarily pulledout of the OPEC quota system because the cartel failed to increaseKuwait's share of total production in the last half of the year.   But he insisted, ``We will use that freedom (from the quotasystem) very, very responsibly.''   The new agreement was designed to keep a firm grip on productionin order to keep prices strong. Oil markets initially reacted withskepticsm to the cartel's ability to restrain output, but U.S. crudeprices appeared to stabilize somewhat today.   Sabah said Kuwait intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a dayin the coming months, compared to its quota of 1.09 million barrels.Its current production is estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day ormore.   Other ministers appeared to accept Kuwait's position. SaudiArabia's Hisham Nazer indicated that Kuwait's extra sales would betolerated as long as they did not exceed 1.35 million barrels a day.   After six days of bargaining, the cartel agreed to boost itsoutput ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-Decemberperiod, up a million barrels from the current level.   They agreed to divide up the extra sales proportionately amongall members.   To meet the new ceiling, some of the countries will have to cuttheir production. Analysts estimate output has picked up in recentweeks to 21 million barrels a day.   Nazer said he would have liked the production cap set at 20million barrels a day in the second half of the year, but he saidseveral producers were worried a higher ceiling might have an impacton prices.   The ministers agreed to meet again in September and decidewhether to boost their output to 20 million barrels a day, beginningOct. 1.   The cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels a dayin recent weeks, analysts say. So the producing nations would haveto turn down their taps to meet the new supply level.   ``Everybody is supposed to rein in production levels (to theirassigned quota),'' said OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman.   The members also decided to keep their benchmark price at $18 abarrel, about the current price of a basket of crudes monitored byOPEC.   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. inNew York, said the new arrangement should not ``have a signficantimpact on gasoline prices at the pump.''   Production cutbacks made early in the year by the cartel havesent U.S. gasoline prices soaring.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for WestTexas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, closed down 79cents to $19.67 a barrel on Wednesday, but the near-term contractwas up 5 cents at midday.   Mlotok said prices fell because the markets figured the nationswould continue producing at the present pace.   ``Current (output) levels,'' he said, ``are a bit high to supporta price over $20 ... so they took the price down about a dollar.''   In reaching an agreement, the organization rejected demands byKuwait, the United Arab Emirates and others for a bigger share ofthe pie.   Kuwait's insistence on a larger chunk caused talks to break downTuesday.   In pressing for a greater share of the increase, Kuwait waspitted against influential Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crudeexporter.   Saudi Arabia's Nazer wanted the increase shared on a pro-ratabasis among all members.   ``If it is found that the demand warrants an increase in theceiling, then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day orany other level agreed upon,'' said a statement released by theministers. Any adjustments would be made Oct. 1.   Prices have been much stronger than expected due to OPEC cutbacksearlier in the year and accidents in key oil-producing regionsrestricting supply.   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by thecartel exceeded the $18 reference earlier in the year.   With the recent pickup in OPEC production, prices have eased somebut are still more than 40 percent higher than late last November.   The ministers' statement said they intend to talk to independentproducing nations ``with a view to soliciting their cooperation insupport of market stability.''   Some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtailtheir output to help bolster prices.   OPEC's members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E. andVenezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
