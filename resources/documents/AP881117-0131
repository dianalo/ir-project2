The Commerce Department said construction began on new homes andapartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 millionunits last month, up 7.2 percent from September. It was the highestlevel since April and the sharpest increase since February.   ``This is yet one more sign that our economy is doing verywell,'' said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor, nowchief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.   ``The consumer is very confident. There are a lot of jobsavailable ... We've had some instability in the financial markets,but nothing to worry the consumer excessively,'' he said.   A month ago, most economists were saying the Federal Reserve'sprogram of pushing up interest rates since late March was beginningto take hold, slowing economic growth to a pace consideredsustainable without inflation.   But starting Nov. 4 with the release of the Labor Department'sreport on October employment, most signs have pointed to renewedvigor in the economy, suggesting the Federal Reserve may pushinterest rates up another notch to dampen growth.   The unemployment rate last month was at a 14-year low, retailsales registered their sharpest increase in eight months, and theoperating rate at factories, mines and utilities hit an 8{-yearhigh. Exports in September climbed to a new record.   However, excessive economic strength can be too much of a goodthing, straining manufacturers' ability to produce, leading toshortages of goods and higher prices. The goal of the FederalReserve is to check the growth through higher interest rates withoutchoking it off completely.   ``The Fed tightening since March hasn't taken a heck of a lot ofsteam out of the economy,'' said David Seiders, chief economist ofthe National Association of Home Builders and a former FederalReserve staff member.   He predicted a hike in the discount rate, the interest the Fedcharges member banks for loans, by the end of the year.   ``We know the Fed will do whatever it takes to slow the economydown, and that means slowing the housing sector down. So we're alittle worried about the future,'' he said.   The big gain in housing starts last month followed two declines:0.8 percent in September and a 1.1 percent in August.   Although the October number was strong, economists noted that thebiggest part of the increase was concentrated in the West, where theCalifornia market is booming. They also said a temporary decline inmortgage interest rates of more than half a percentage point betweenmid-August and early November bolstered activity.   ``What we're seeing is primarily a Western phenomenon,'' saidMark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions. ``I think, in retrospect, we'll see this as a littlebit of a spike. We may see this pace for another month or so, but wesurely won't see it for another six months.''   Excluding the West, where the robust economy and populationgrowth of California dominate the statistics, the overall increasewould have been a more moderate 3.9 percent.   Housing starts shot up 15 percent in the West to 498,000 units,the highest level since December 1986. Starts rose 7.6 percent inthe Midwest to 268,000 units, climbed 4.6 percent in the South to586,000 units and fell 2.4 percent in the Northeast to 202,000.   For the first 10 months of the year, housing starts were running9.6 percent behind the same period of 1987. The peak year forhousing construction during the current economic expansion was 1986,when 1.81 million units were started. Starts fell to 1.62 millionlast year and are expected to hit 1.45 million this year.   Michael Sumichrast, a private real estate economist inWashington, said rising interest rates and high home prices likelywill push starts down even further to about 1.35 million units nextyear.   Single-family homes in October were built at an annual rate of1.15 million units, up 10.0 percent, following a 3.3 percent declinea month earlier.   Apartment construction was up a scant 0.2 percent to 408,000units in October after rising 6.3 percent in September.   Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity,shot up 7.4 percent in October to an annual rate of 1.50 millionunits, the highest since September 1987. Permits had fallen 4.8percent a month earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
