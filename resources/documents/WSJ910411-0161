A steady flow of bad news of late has put the state'sbanks on the spot, and in the spotlight.</LP><TEXT>   Connecticut's banks have the highest percentage of badloans of any state in the nation, according to recentlyreleased figures. One of the state's largest independentbanks, Citytrust Bancorp Inc. in Bridgeport, this weekreported a loss that wiped out its equity. And the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. is setting up a new office in theHartford area, in part to prepare for bank failures.   As in other New England states, Connecticut's banks havebeen hurt by reckless real estate lending during the boomyears of the 1980s. And their problems have been compoundedby the state's broader economic decline. &quot;The economy hasbeen hit very hard, partly due to defense cutbacks andinsurance companies cutting back,&quot; noted Gerard Cassidy, ananalyst at Tucker Anthony Inc. &quot;Many traditional segments ofthe economy that had performed well aren't doing so well.&quot;   Because of the economic slowdown, the state faces a budgetdeficit of some $2.4 billion, and is considering adopting itsfirst-ever state income tax.   Underscoring the mounting problems facing the state'sbanks, Sheshunoff Information Services, which tracks thebanking industry, says that Connecticut banks have more than$2.4 billion in nonperforming loans -- or 10.4% of all loans.That is the worst percentage in the nation, well ahead ofWashington, D.C., with 8.6%, and Massachusetts, 8%, accordingto Sheshunoff.   The largest banks in Connecticut include: Shawmut NationalCorp., based in Hartford, which has assets of $24.5 billionand posted a loss of $133 million in 1990; the $7.2billion-asset, Hartford-based Connecticut Bank andamp; Trust unitof the failed Bank of New England, based in Boston; Bank ofBoston Corp.'s $2.4 billion-asset Bank of Boston Connecticut,based in Waterbury; and the $2.3 billion Fleet Bank ofConnecticut unit of Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. ofProvidence, R.I.   Analysts blame the overbuilding of commercial propertythroughout the state more than anything else. Hartford, forexample, has an office-vacancy rate of about 25% -- among theworst of any sizable city in the nation. That isn't likely toimprove any time soon. &quot;Insurance companies drove the marketfor the decade of the 1980s, and now that they're laying offdemand for office space is not there,&quot; said Tracey Stangle,an analyst at First Albany Corp.'s Hartford office. Heforecasts &quot;stabilization, at best&quot; near-term for the economyand the real estate sector.   In the southern part of the state, Citytrust, with assetsof $2.1 billion, figured among the most aggressive lenders.Citing &quot;plummeting real estate values in Connecticut,&quot; thecompany on Tuesday reported a loss of $122.6 million for 1990-- resulting in negative equity of $55.3 million as of Dec.31. Citytrust continues to operate while it seeks to raisecapital -- possibly a combination of federal and privateinvestment -- but its prospects aren't good. &quot;It looks to melike a black hole. Its fundamentals have deteriorated overthe last six quarters,&quot; Mr. Stangle noted.   But Citytrust is hardly alone. Indeed, analysts predictConnecticut -- which has had a half dozen or so bank failuresin the past year -- could have twice as many by the end ofthis year. And &quot;we might be on the low side,&quot; said Mr.Cassidy.   Indeed, girding for more failures, the FDIC is planning toopen a branch office of its liquidation division in theHartford area with as many as 400 employees. The office won'tconcentrate exclusively on Connecticut, but Mr. Cassidy saidthe location is noteworthy, because the agency had consideredopening the office in northern Massachusetts or southern NewHampshire.</TEXT></DOC>
