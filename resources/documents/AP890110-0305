However, Walter C. Wallace wouldn't say what he'll do aboutcompany calls for an impasse declaration or a warning from theinternational Machinists president of a potential ``nationwidedisruption of service.'' Wallace also didn't lay blame for the endof the talks.   Wallace abruptly left Key Largo, Fla., Monday on the fourth dayof intense talks he set in hopes of resolving a 15-month-oldcontract dispute between Eastern and its 8,500-member Machinistsunion.   In a statement from Washington, Wallace said he stopped thesessions ``because the prearranged conditions planned and necessaryto the success of such talks were compromised, undermining thecollective bargaining process and mediation by the (NationalMediation Board.)''   Wallace said bargaining ``in a fish bowl yields nothing. In suchsituations, the parties tend to make proposals and statements aimedat public relations objectives rather than the bargaining process.The board will continue its efforts to bring the parties togetherunder proper circumstances where a solution of the labor dispute canbe achieved.''   Mediation board officials declined comment, but gave no sign theywould declare an impasse. That would start a 30-day deadline, afterwhich the union could strike and Eastern could impose its own workconditions.   Union leaders charge that Eastern wants to provoke a strike so itcan try to break it and bust the union. Eastern says deadlinepressure is needed to get the negotiations moving.   The mediation board, which received the case in January 1988,could schedule more talks, declare an impasse, or ask both sides tosubmit to binding arbitration. Both sides would have to agree toarbitration.   Machinists District 100 leader Charles E. Bryan on Monday chargedthat the company sabotaged the talks by refusing to make any newoffers and by putting out what he called deceptive employeebulletins that were easily obtained by the news media.   Eastern officials denied they had done anything wrong.   Meanwhile, reporters obtained a Jan. 3 letter to Wallace fromWilliam W. Winpisinger, Washington-based international president ofthe Machinists.   Winpisinger's letter complained about the pressure being put onthe mediation board by Eastern, its Texas Air Corp. parent andEastern supporters. Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, the Greater MiamiChamber of Commerce and editorials in leading newspapers have calledfor declaration of an impasse.   Winpisinger countered by saying the international union wouldsupport Eastern Machinists, if necessary, with ``self-help againstEastern Airlines and ... secondary activity against a number ofother major carriers.   ``...The responsibility for a nationwide disruption of servicewill be laid at the doorstep of Eastern Airlines and its allies inthis dispute because it has adamantly refused to make anycounteroffer whatsoever to the proposals of the IAM,'' Winpisinger'sletter said.   The Machinists represent workers at Trans World Airlines, USAir,United Airlines and Northwest Airlines. Winpisinger was out of townTuesday and couldn't be reached for comment.   Eastern, meanwhile, reportedly has been trying to sell some ofits planes, its airport gates in Philadelphia and some Canadianroutes, on the heels of the recent sale of its Northeast shuttleservice to developer Donald Trump for $365 million in cash.   ``Clearly, the happenings of this last weekend will make us moveforward faster on some asset sales than perhaps we would have doneotherwise,'' Joseph B. Leonard, Eastern's senior vice president andchief operating officer, said Monday.   Also on Monday, the Internal Revenue Service gave Easternpermission to reschedule $105 million in pension payments due lastSept. 15. Eastern now has until Sept. 15 of this year to finishmaking periodic payments into the employee pension plans. Leonardsaid the payments would be financed by pending asset sales.   Eastern, saying the money-losing carrier's survival is threatenedby failure to reach a settlement with the Machinists, again calledfor declaration of a 30-day deadline. The company estimates lossesat $1 million a day.   The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, havebeen some $200 million apart. The Machinists, representing 8,500mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground service workers, ormore than one-fourth of Eastern's employees, were seeking a $50million raise, the company said.   Eastern was seeking $150 million in concessions, mostly from thenon-mechanics, but said it was offering job security and trainingprograms.   Eastern, which posted $233.7 million in losses for the firstthree quarters of 1988, has been owned 2{ years by Houston-basedTexas Air, which also owns non-union Continental Airlines.</TEXT></DOC>
