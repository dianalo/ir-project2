The gas pipeline concern said the new facilities wouldallow it to transport 152 million cubic feet of additionalnatural gas from Alberta to eastern Canada and the U.S.beginning in late 1992. About 71 million cubic feet of gaswill go to export customers in the U.S., the company said.</LP><TEXT>   If the application is filed next week, a spokesman forTransCanada PipeLines said, a hearing could take place inmid-November. Approvals could be received early in 1992,allowing the new facilities to be in place by November 1992.   Analysts said the proposal is much smaller than the C$700million plan they had expected TransCanada to announce.   &quot;Gas demand has tapered off this year, and I would expectthat given the soft demand a lot of new contract proposalshave been postponed until 1993,&quot; said Douglas Flegg, ananalyst with Midland Walwyn, a Toronto-based securitiesdealer.   Mr. Flegg said that it is likely that TransCanada'sfacilities application for 1993 will be much larger.   &quot;In Ontario, the stance of the New Democratic Party hasreally given a boost to natural gas consumption by promotingprivate power projects and cogeneration,&quot; Mr. Flegg said.   Elected last September, the NDP government of Ontario hasput a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants,the province's main energy source. Instead, it is promotingsmaller gas-fired cogeneration or combined-cycle power plantsin the province which would sell electricity to theutilities.   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,TransCanada shares sold for $15.125, unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
