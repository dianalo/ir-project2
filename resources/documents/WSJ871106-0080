The biotechnology concern added that in a federal filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, Baxter disclosed that it may buy as much as 20% of Genetics Institute's common stock, &quot;assuming the continuance of current market conditions.&quot;    Yesterday, a spokesman for Baxter said the company bought the stock because it considered it &quot;a good investment.&quot; He added that Baxter may acquire more during the next two to six months, depending on market conditions.    Like many companies, Genetics Institute experienced a recent sharp stock price decline. The company, which made a secondary public offering in June of two million shares at $34.25 each, closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $19.75, off 50 cents.    A Genetics Institute spokesman said Baxter's purchase &quot;is nothing out of the ordinary. We expect there will be a lot of interest in our stock at these prices.&quot; Gabriel Schmergel, Genetics Institute's president and chief executive officer, added that the company &quot;isn't for sale and hasn't held discussions with any party, including Baxter, in this regard.&quot;    Baxter, based in Deerfield, Ill., makes and distributes medical products and offers medical-related services. The two companies have had close relations for several years. Mr. Schmergel and other Genetics Institute executives formerly worked for Baxter, which purchased a stake in the biotechnology concern in 1982.    Baxter also has supported the development of several of the biotechnology concern's products, including Factor VIII, an experimental drug to help prevent bleeding in hemophiliacs, and tissue plasminogen activator, a drug being developed to dissolve blood clots that cause heart attacks. </TEXT></DOC>
