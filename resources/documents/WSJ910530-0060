Iranian officials confirmed that negotiations are underway with U.S. and several other Western concerns ondeveloping oil and natural gas deposits in Iran, as part of arecent National Iranian Oil Co. drive to attract foreigninvestment to boost the country's production capacity. Theinvestment overtures fit in with the more-moderate stancethat Iran has been taking of late in an attempt to end itscommercial and diplomatic isolation.</LP><TEXT>   Mehdi Hosseini, a director of National Iranian Oil, saidIran is prepared to offer long-term crude sales contracts onfavorable terms to companies that invest in exploration anddevelopment in Iran. However, he ruled out any equity orproduction sharing agreements, which he said would becontrary to Iranian law.   At present, foreign companies are involved in the Iranianoil sector only through service or construction contracts.   Mr. Hosseini declined to identify the companies holdingtalks with the Iranian oil company, but he said oil concernsfrom France, Italy, Austria, Norway and Japan were alreadyholding discussions.   Oil sources said Chevron Corp., France's Total-Cie.Francaise des Petroles, Italy's Agip S.p.A., Japan NationalOil Co., and British Petroleum Co. are among the companiesthat have expressed interest.   Chevron representatives attending an oil conference heremet officials of the National Iranian Oil Co. Tuesday nightfor preliminary talks, according to sources, who asked not tobe identified.   Chevron confirmed that it sent representatives to theindustrywide conference in Isfahan. But company officials inthe U.S. denied that the concern is involved in anydiscussions concerning the development of Iranian oil fields.The company did say, however, that it &quot;has had longrelationships with Iran and looks forward to renewing thoserelationships as conditions permit.&quot;   Late yesterday, officials of the European oil companiescouldn't be reached for comment. However, Italy's ForeignMinister Gianni De Michelis visited Tehran earlier this year,paving the way for possible contracts.   While Washington hasn't normalized relations with Iran,American companies are free to establish new business linkswith the country because most U.S. claims against Iran arealready settled. However, Iran is still one of several&quot;countries of concern&quot; that the U.S. has to treat withcaution as a destination for certain types of sensitivetechnology. Under Washington's stricter rules for tradingwith those countries, U.S. companies have to obtain exportlicenses to undertake industrial projects for those states.   Mr. Hosseini said talks mainly involve existingdiscoveries that can't afford to develop on their own,specifically the Sirri and Balal offshore fields in thePersian Gulf and offshore deposits in the Strait of Hormuz.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh reiterated thisweek that Iran plans to boost its oil output capacity to fivemillion barrels a day by 1993 from the current 3.5 millionbarrels a day. Mr. Hosseini said that goal may not be metwithout foreign help.   Oil industry sources said that there could be severalpermutations to an investment agreement that might attractforeign companies, even if they fell short of a fullproduction-sharing agreement, in which operating companiesare entitled to a share of the oil or gas produced as thoughthey own it. Radicals in the Iranian parliament would belikely to put restrictions on production agreements.   &quot;There's a whole range of possibilities between a simpleservice contract and a production sharing deal,&quot; said arepresentative of one company in talks with National IranianOil.   Mr. Hosseini said foreign companies also are interested inIranian gas development, including the offshore South Parsfield, the Iranian name for the North Field, which liesmainly in Qatari waters. Iran gave a contract in March toItaly's Technipetrol S.p.A. and a Soviet concern to developthe Iranian side of South Pars.   Participating Western companies could be repaid throughthe output of condensates from the fields, Mr. Hosseini said,while gas would be supplied to onshore oil fields forreinjection.   Mr. Hosseini also said Iran is considering various plansto invest in oil-refining assets overseas in an effort tofind new markets for its crude oil. Iran is examiningpossible investments in refineries in Thailand and Indonesia.Tentative discussions have taken place with private-sectorcompanies about refinery investments in Greece, Portugal andCuba, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
