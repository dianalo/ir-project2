Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BA BAB GE </CO><IN> AIR ARO </IN><DATELINE> SEATTLE  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Boeing Co. said British Airways signed a memorandum of understanding to buy 31 jetliners, with options for 19 more, for a total of at least $1.78 billion, including spare parts.    The order brings Boeing's total commercial-aircraft orders for the year to 548, with a value of about $25 billion. Of the British carrier's 31 firm orders, six are for 767-300s, which seat between 210 and 290 passengers, and one 757-200, which seats between 180 and 230. The remaining 24 will be Boeing 737 aircraft, with the mix of series yet to be determined.    British Airways' selection of the 737 to replace its existing fleet of smaller BAC 111 aircraft surprised Airbus Industrie, the European consortium based in Toulouse, France, that had been competing for the order. While Airbus seemed to take the decision as a slap in the face, British Airways hasn't ever bought an aircraft directly from Airbus before, so buying one now would have been a major departure for the airline. British Airways does own three A320s, with another seven on order, but it acquired those indirectly through a takeover of competitor British Caledonian.    By contract, British Airways has always bought Boeing 737s for its own shorthaul needs. The airline is one of Boeing's oldest customers, and over the years has ordered a total of 199 jetliners from the aerospace concern, including the latest order.    British Airways said it liked the flexibility in seating arrangements offered by the three 737 series, the -300, -400 and -500, compared with the single-sized, 146-seat Airbus A320.    The different series of 737s would allow British Airways to seat between 105 and 145 in its Club Europe and economy layouts. The 737-400 can provide up to 170 seats in an all-economy layout. All three types of 737 have the same flight-deck layouts and use the same engines, the CFM563 series built by CMF International, a company jointly owned by General Electric Co. and Snecma, of France.    British Airways studied &quot;all available options,&quot; including the A320, but decided on the Boeing aircraft because of the greater flexibility in seating, compatibility with its existing fleet and the commercial-aircraft maker's &quot;competitive economics,&quot; Boeing said.    &quot;The decision has thus been made on purely commercial grounds and will be in the best interests of our customers, shareholders and staff,&quot; British Airways said.    ---   E.S.
