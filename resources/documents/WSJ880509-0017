But they may be about to develop one.    &quot;The more the Tokyo market goes up, the more some Japanese institutions will take profits&quot; in that market, says Hideo Karino, a general manager at Nikko Securities Co. here. &quot;They don't want to make the same mistake as last October.&quot;    Meanwhile, U.S. equities are starting to look cheap to Mr. Karino and others in Japan. U.S. shares trade at roughly 11 times their estimated per-share earnings, with a 3.8% or 3.9% dividend yield. The Tokyo market has a price/earnings ratio of about 85 and a slim 0.5% dividend yield.    Some analysts here think the dollar is close to bottoming out, after the yen's 95% appreciation against it in the past 2 1/2 years. Nomura Securities Co.'s Yoshinari Morimoto, a general manager in the international equity department, has &quot;a gut feeling&quot; that the dollar will rise to 150 yen by year end from about 125 now. If that happened, Japanese investors in U.S. stocks would get a 20% gain from the currency change alone.    Japanese portfolios last year added $16.87 billion of foreign equities, with more than 80% of that amount going for U.S. stocks, estimates Shusei Saito, a general manager at Daiwa Securities Co. But after buying a net $2.38 billion last October, the Japanese made steadily dwindling purchases until March, when they became net sellers of foreign equities -- $830 million worth -- for the first time since December 1985.    Mr. Saito now detects technical strength. The dollar hasn't fallen below 123 yen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been able to hold on above 2000 and has stayed above its previous lows, despite a 102-point drop April 14. He also cites solid U.S. corporate earnings and signs that the U.S. is moving to shrink its budget and trade deficits.    Daiwa has begun recommending U.S. blue-chip stocks, especially those listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Sixty-three U.S. companies trade there, including 15 of the 30 that make up the Dow industrials. In particular, Mr. Saito likes International Business Machines, Intel, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard -- companies he believes have good proprietary technology.    Nomura's Mr. Morimoto also favors high-tech bets -- including Motorola and Texas Instruments -- as well as Schlumberger and the drug companies Genentech, Merck, Eli Lilly and Warner-Lambert. &quot;By nature, Japanese investors like high-technology and biotechnology or pharmaceuticals,&quot; Mr. Karino says. His recommendations include Digital Equipment, Compaq Computer and Amdahl, which he says is successfully selling computers in Japan through Fujitsu.    Many people in Tokyo admire Upjohn, which they expect to win Food and Drug Administration approval to market the hair-growing drug Rogaine. Since mid-August, Japan's Taisho Pharmaceutical has zoomed to 2270 yen from 1900 yen. Its stock closed at 2250 yen Friday. Taisho has exclusive rights to sell Rogaine in Japan, Mr. Karino notes.    Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. has decided to increase its investment in foreign equities 50% to 120 billion yen in the year that began April 1, Mr. Karino says. He expects its buying program to begin toward the end of this month, with 70% of the cash flowing to U.S. stocks. Two weeks ago, $700 million of Japanese cash raised by Nomura poured into a new mutual fund managed by Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management of Orinda, Calif.    Nomura's Mr. Morimoto is cautious. He warns that the strong U.S. economy could rekindle U.S. inflationary fears, driving up U.S. interest rates. And he worries that higher U.S. corporate earnings will be seen as an inflation harbinger, prompting stock-selling.    If long-term U.S. interest rates stay around 9% and the dollar between 123 and 128 yen, Mr. Morimoto sees the Dow industrial average below 2000 as a buy signal and one above 2100 as an opportunity to take profits. If the dollar climbs above 130 yen, he thinks the Dow could hit 2200 before profit-taking sets in.    &quot;From a fundamental aspect, the (U.S.) market outlook is good. What is needed is a resumption of investor confidence by Americans first,&quot; says Daiwa's Mr. Saito. &quot;When they resume confidence, we can follow. It's their market.&quot;    ---   Friday Market Activity   Stock prices continued their slide in one of the slowest sessions of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.77 to 2007.46, as futures-related selling late in the session wiped out the market's early gains. For the week, the average lost 24.87 points.    Big Board volume was the third lowest of the year at 129.1 million shares, compared with 171.8 million Thursday. The latest total wasn't far above the single-session low for the year of 128.7 million, set the previous Thursday.    Reaction to the government's unemployment report for April was muted. Analysts said declining stock prices reflected a downturn in bonds, where investors interpreted the data as a sign of continued economic strength.    Most oil stocks rose on a further upturn in crude-oil prices in the wake of an explosion at a Shell Oil refining plant in Louisiana. Exxon gained 1/4 to 44 1/8, Texaco added 3/4 to 52 1/8, Chevron advanced 1/4 to 48 1/4, Mobil climbed 5/8 to 46 1/8 and Amoco finished unchanged at 75 5/8. Quantum Chemical, which said it expects a production cutback at its Gulf Coast petrochemical facilities as a result of the explosion, dropped 3 1/4 to 82.    Genentech dropped 2 3/4 to 30 3/4. A company official said the company plans a sharp increase in its research and development spending.    Trans World Airlines gained 1 1/8 to 35 1/2. Chairman Carl Icahn sweetened his going-private offer to $50 a share in cash and debentures from $49, and TWA's board accepted the revised bid.    Long Island Lighting climbed 3/4 to 9 1/2. The Long Island Power Authority increased its takeover offer for the second time in two weeks, this time to $12 a share from $10.    Tandy Corp. added 5/8 to 44 7/8. The company announced plans to buy back as many as 1.6 million of its common shares for use in its planned acquisition of Grid Systems.    Chock Full O' Nuts added 1 1/4 to 10 1/8. An investor group including Pegasus Holding, a New York-based firm, said it holds a 10% stake in the company and may seek control.    Imo DeLaval fell 1 7/8 to 35 7/8. The company filed for an offering of three million common shares, which will be made following the completion of a 2-for-1 stock split.    Montedison gained 5/8 to 13 3/4 amid indications that Dow Chemical is positioning itself for possible future involvement in the company's planned joint venture with state-owned Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi. Dow Chemical owns 4% to 5% of the company's common shares and has filed for U.S. clearance to boost its stake. Its stock closed down 1/8 at 83 7/8.    Irving Bank eased 3/8 to 60 as the company and Bank of New York, its hostile suitor, both claimed victory in their proxy fight for control of the board. The final outcome won't be known until at least May 24, when Irving said it expects to receive the results of the voting. Bank of New York added 1/8 to 30 1/4. </TEXT></DOC>
