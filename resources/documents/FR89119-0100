This informationbase will also allow program cost to be made known to the lowest appropriatecost centers in order to encourage increased improvement in reducing occupationalhealth and safety program costs, accident rates and increased emphasison safe work practices and conditions. In addition, the data will be usedto facilitate the effective and efficient administration of the agency'sairman/air traffic controller health data program system. This system possessesfull security and privacy protection systems and interfaces with and collectsoccupation-related data, including personnel data and data on disabilityretirement actions, workers' compensation data, organizational and facilityidentifiers, and medical evaluations on air traffic controllers. The costdata from WCIS will further be used by managers to maintain a true accountingof the costs of job-related mishaps within their organizations. The systempermits data gathered at the local level when merged with Department ofLabor chargeback information and incorporated with DOT personnel and payrollsystems to be aggregated into a data base which provides a National andregional view of information. The system will provide for the use of standardreports and the availability of ad hoc query capabilities which will enhancemonitoring capabilities and the productivity of the human resource managementwork forces. The Department of Transportation believes the proposed systemof records is the best means of performing these functions and achievingprogram objectives as directed by the Office of Management and Budget.2. <T3>Legal Authority. </T3>The legal authority under which this system ofrecords will be maintained is found in 5 U.S.C.

This system's data may be shared with these agencies upontheir written request and approval under guidelines established by thePrivacy Act and the agency's governing regulations as necessary for achievementof the agency's assigned mission.5. <T3>Security. </T3>Magnetic tape and disc files will be kept with limitedaccessibility by agency personnel. Other files are retained in a securedwork area which is locked during non-duty hours.6. <T3>Compatibility of Routine Uses With the Purposes for Which the Recordswere Collected. </T3>Each of the routine uses of the system of recordsis related to and required for proper management and integration of theinjury compensation program with the overall DOT human resource managementresponsibilities.
