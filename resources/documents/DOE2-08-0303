Thestructures can be described only in a statistical fashion by means offractal geometry. The structures are controlled by the relative ratesof the hydrolysis reactions which generate reactive silanol groups andthe condensation reactions of those groups. Under alkaline conditions,hydrolysis tends to be slow with respect to condensation, and non-fractalcolloidal structures form by a nucleation and reaction limited growthprocess. Under acidic condition, hydrolysis tends to be fast with respectto condensation, and &quot;polymeric&quot; fractal structures with D{sub f} = 2.1are formed by reaction limited cluster aggregation. The exact structurein real systems may only approach these idealized cases. 20 refs., 4figs.</TEXT></DOC>
