Flood Insurance Studies establishingspecial flood hazard areas, risk zones, floodways and base flood elevationsfor individual flood-prone communities have been prepared by the FederalInsurance Administration (FIA). After the Flood Insurance Study is publishedthe technical and administrative support data developed during the conductof the study is microfilmed and stored for future reference within an EngineeringStudy Data Package (ESDP). Microfilm copies of this data are also routinelyprovided to the designated NFIP State Coordinating Agencies and appropriateDistrict Offices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at that time. Thedata is frequently utilized by FEMA and its Flood Insurance Study and technicalevaluation contractors. It is less frequently requested by other Federal,state and local government agencies and private engineering and consultingfirms, real estate developers and individuals.Since 1981, the Federal Insurance Administration has made the data availablefree of charge to all requestors. As the program has grown and matured,the costs associated with retrieving, reproducing, and distributing thedata have increased. Also, the number of non-FEMA related data requestsis steadily growing so that it now costs the Federal Insurance Administrationapproximately $100,000 annually to provide this service to outside requestors.The Federal Insurance Administration has decided to implement measuresto recover the costs associated with providing this service. It is proposedto assess an ESDP user fee charge effective October 15, 1989 to those organizationsand individuals not directly involved in the Flood Insurance Study process.Under this proposal, all entities except FIA's Flood Insurance Study contractors,technical evaluation contractors and Federal agencies primarily involvedin flood studies would be charged for data requests. These Federal agenciesare the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Department of the Interior,U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Oceanographic and AtmosphericAdministration, Tennessee Valley Authority, and United States GeologicalSurvey. The NFIP State Coordinating Agencies and District Offices of theCorps of Engineers will continue to rountinely receive free microfilm copiesof the ESDP information as it is produced. One copy of any technical supportinformation requested by a community during the statutory 90-day appealperiod for their flood insurance study will also be provided free of charge.The fee charge operation will also provide enhanced services such as paperand computer disk copies of data. Currently, data is transmitted to requestorsin microfilm or hardcopy form only.The proposed fee will be based on recovery of the actual costs incurredby FIA for the labor and material consumed in retrieving, reproducing,and distributing the data to the requestor as well as a prorated shareof the additional management, administrative, and operating expenses associatedwith the data retrieval and fee charge operation.Although the cost of individual requests will vary depending upon the volumeand medium of the data to be reproduced and distributed as well as thecomplexity of researching and retrieving that data, the cost of the averagerequest, based on a recent sample of data requests, should be approximately$100-$150. All requests must be submitted in writing and the requestorwill be notified of the total charge prior to incurring any financial obligation.Fee payments will be required in advance of the shipment of data. The proposedmethod of payment is prepayment by check or money order made payable tothe National Flood Insurance Program. The requestor will receive a receiptfor their records or billing purposes.The fees collected by the fee-charge operation will be deposited to theNational Flood Insurance Fund because it is the source of funding utilizedto provide these services.Anyone who has an interest in the ESDP user fee charge system should providetheir comments in accordance with the date and address listed above.<ITAG tagnum="6">Harold T.
