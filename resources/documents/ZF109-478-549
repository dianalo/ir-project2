MurieandM;Personal computers and dot-matrix form-feed printers have long been used tocreate banners.andP;  However, the arrival of sheet-fed laser printers put an endto the &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; signs strung around the office.andP;  Not only were theseprinters incapable of printing to the edges of the page, but the largest pagesize a PostScript printer could handle was an 11-by-17-inch tabloid.andP;  Page-layout programs also are generally limited to the tabloid page.andM;Enter S.H.andP;  Pierce andamp; Co.'s PosterWorks 2.0.andP;  Similar to a page-layout programbut using a single page measuring up to 100 square feet, it creates postersby &quot;tiling&quot; -- printing segments of the final page on multiple pages.andP;  Thefirst version of PosterWorks was a giant step forward from the bannerprograms, and Version 2.0 adds Encapsulated PostScript file support amongother new features.andP;  In addition to halftone and color posters, it can outputfour-color separations for the mass production of posters.andM;Creating a poster.andP;  The first step in creating a PosterWorks document is touse the Tile Setup dialog box to define its format.andP;  Among other things, youspecify whether it will be a one-color halftone, full-color printout orfour-color separation.andP;  Other information needed for accurate formattingincludes printer page size and print margins.andP;  PosterWorks shows the area ofthe poster with a gray grid indicating each tile.andM;Like a page-layout program, PosterWorks can bring together illustrations frommany sources.andP;  PosterWorks can read TIFF and Scitex image files as well asEPS graphics.andP;  No text or objects can be created within the program.andP;  When aTIFF file is placed into a poster, a lower-resolution image is created thatis used for screen display and saved in the document.andP;  When the poster isprinted, the program accesses the TIFF file on-disk to create the finaloutput.andP;  Preview mode will display the high-resolution image, but the postercannot be edited while in this mode.andM;Imported objects can be stretched and cropped.andP;  The stretching and croppingtools are contained in a toolbox area on the document itself rather than in aseparate windoid.andP;  The toolbox can be situated on the left side of a documentor across the top, depending on user preference.andP;  A pop-up menu labeled View,located in the toolbox, is used to change the magnification of the posterdisplay.andP;  The Unit pop-up menu switches measurement systems.andM;Another pop-up menu provides a list of all elements that have been importedinto the document.andP;  This is useful if one object is obscured by another.andO;When an object is selected, the width and height are displayed in fields inthe toolbox.andP;  These can be changed directly by typing a new height or widthand pressing the Apply button.andP;  The location of the objects can also bechanged by entering numerical values.andM;The Layout Options dialog box can scale and change the size of the poster aswell as help in efficiently fitting the poster to the tiles.andM;Printing.andP;  PosterWorks will create PostScript files for halftone, color orseparated posters.andP;  Additionally, a poster can be saved in EPS files.andO;Finally, a poster can be saved in Open Prepress Interface (OPI) for outputusing high-end pre-press systems.andM;One of the most important issues to consider when printing color iscalibration.andP;  PosterWorks provides a test image to calibrate your printingsystem.andP;  A hard copy of the calibration image is not provided, but standardpercentages of process colors are used, so it should be easy to find acomparison chart.andP;  Calibration is necessary for halftone and color printingas well as for separations.andP;  Our QMS ColorScript test image revealed thatcyan and magenta were too dark and tended to swamp the yellow ink.andP;  Thoseunfamiliar with color theory would be better served with more-detailedinstructions on working through the calibration steps.andM;Calibration, page size and output-format information are saved in a Settingsfile and can be reloaded at any time.andP;  Working on two posters for output ondifferent devices, we had to load the correct settings for each file.andM;PosterWorks doesn't print directly to your printer.andP;  It first creates aPostScript file on your hard disk, which is then printed using Adobe SystemsInc.'s Send PS utility, which is provided with PosterWorks.andP;  While thisprocess may seem strange at first, it makes sense if you create the poster onone machine and print it on another.andM;PosterWorks requires System 6.0.3 or later and can run on a Mac Plus.andP;  Colorposters can be created on black-and-white systems.andP;  Because PosterWorks onlyoutputs PostScript files, a PostScript interpreter such as Freedom of Pressfrom Custom Applications Inc. is needed to print to QuickDraw printers suchas Tektronix's QuickColor.andM;Output pages can be printed with crop and registration marks.andP;  To help withthe trimming and alignment of the completed poster, PosterWorks also willprint a one-eighth-inch bleed into the margin area and print page numbers tohelp in poster assembly.andM;Room for improvement.andP;  Working with large-format pages requires flexibletools, and some are missing from PosterWorks 2.0.andP;  We would like to be ableto zoom in and out using the keyboard.andP;  On-line help has been provided in acouple of places and should be extended to cover more of the color setups anddialogs.andP;  We also found it awkward to enlarge an object proportionally tocover the whole poster area.andP;  This is because an object cannot be stretchedoff the poster area, so we had to enlarge the object, crop it and enlarge itagain.andM;Conclusions.andP;  PosterWorks is a specialized program that makes creating largeposters easy.andP;  To create layouts larger than tabloid size, considerPosterWorks for its speed, ease of use and calibration controls.andP;  BroderbundSoftware Inc. recently released Bannermania, which prints long banners, butwe know of no other program for the Macintosh that offers similar featuresfor printing large tiled documents.andM;S.H.andP;  Pierce andamp; Co. is located at 1 Kendall Square, Building 600, Suite 323,Cambridge, Mass.andP;  02139; (617) 395-8350.andM;Large-format printers make creating posters a lot easier by eliminating thetiling process.andP;  But there are two technical hurdles that must be overcome inusing large-format printers with the Macintosh: connecting to andcommunicating with the printer.andP;  While PostScript is the preferredpage-description language for high-quality Mac output because it providesfont scaling and halftones, Adobe does not offer an interpreter for printerformats larger than tabloid size.andP;  Luckily, other vendors have begun to fillthe void.andM;Custom Applications Inc. offers a PostScript interface to large-formatprinters.andP;  Its Freedom of Press product runs both on Macs and IBM PCs andcompatibles.andP;  Until recently, the Macintosh version did not supportlarge-format printers, but CAI recently announced the Mac Professionalversion, which supports devices such as the Canon CLC500 through a GeneralPurpose Interface Bus (GPIB) card from National Instruments Corp.andP;  At theupcoming Seybold Computer Publishing Conference andamp; Exposition, it will showsupport for the Iris 3000 series through the MacPlot card from Microspot Ltd.andO;In the future, the company plans to add electrostatic plotters, such as thosefrom Versatec Inc. and CalComp Inc.andM;We spoke to two service bureaus offering PostScript output on large-formatprinters.andP;  Both are using the PC version of Freedom of Press to create theactual output.andP;  Medical-Legal Illustrations Inc. of Atlanta has a Versatecelectrostatic plotter.andP;  The company charges about $10 a square foot to printa poster.andP;  Synchronic Systems Inc. of St. Louis has an Iris 3024.andP;  Thisinkjet printer is capable of producing near-photographic-quality imagesthanks to its high (1400-dpi) resolution.andP;  It has a maximum page size of 2feet by 2 feet.andP;  Costs vary from $55 for an 8-by-10-inch page to $125 for a2-foot-square print, with discounts for multiple pages.andM;Medical-Legal Illustrations Inc. can be reached at (800) 755-2326; SynchronicSystems at (800) 448-0759; and Custom Applications Inc. at (508) 667-8585.andO;-- By Michael D.
