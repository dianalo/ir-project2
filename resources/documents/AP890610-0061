(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fifteen protesters against the Seabrooknuclear power plant, seeking a day in court, got themselves arrestedSaturday on a more serious charge than normal for suchdemonstrations.   ``We feel fine about that. We've been trying to do that for threeyears,'' said Lee Wheeler, a spokesman for the anti-nuclear group,Clamshell Alliance.   Twelve adults and three juveniles were arrested shortly after7:30 a.m. as they tried to block traffic at a gate to the stalled $6billion plant, police said. The adults were released on bail orpersonal recognizance and the juveniles were held until theirparents took them away.   All 15 were charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing, anoffense that carries a maximum penalty upon conviction of a $1,000fine and a year in jail.   A three-day demonstration last weekend at Seabrook resulted in734 arrests, although most of those arrested _ some more than once _were charged only with a criminal trespass violation. A violation isa summons, like a parking ticket, that carries a maximum $500 fineand does not have to go to trial.   Wheeler said the purpose of Saturday's blockade was to gettougher charges filed so the group could get a court hearing.   ``This was basically in response to some TV news shows Tuesdayand Wednesday where the police, etc., were saying that peoplewouldn't do this if the charges were more serious,'' Wheeler said.   Wheeler said the demonstrators hoped to be tried as a group andwith a jury.   A hearing was scheduled for July 10 in Hampton District Court.   The Seabrook reactor was completed nearly three years ago, butfederal regulators and objections by officials in neighboringMassachusetts help up issuance of a license for low-power testsuntil last month.   Seabrook's operators had hoped to start the first chain reactionlast week, but won't be able to do so before at least the middle ofthis week. Three faulty safety valves had to be taken out formodification by the manufacturer. They have been returned toSeabrook and were being re-installed Saturday, said Seabrookspokesman Ron Sher.</TEXT></DOC>
