Now, ChancellorHelmut Kohl has rushed back from Warsaw to keep the flood ofhumanity from turning the dream into a nightmare.   In one of the most dramatic shifts in postwar Europe, theCommunist East German government has thrown open the Berlin Walland also let people cross through the heavily fortified bordersinto West Germany. On Friday, in response to the flow of refugeesand overwhelming criticism from the public, the Communist Party'spolicy-making Central Committee also promised free elections andgreater separation of party and state.   The joy of those who came through by foot and car and even onskateboards only temporarily deflected attention from a suddenlyvolatile Central Europe.   On the human level, there is the question of what do with the200,000 East Germans who already have poured into West Germany _ tosay nothing of the 1 million more that some have predicted mayswamp one of Europe's most densely populated countries.   Mayor Walter Momper of West Berlin told a session of the upperhouse of Parliament the East German newcomers will keep causing``large and weighty problems'' for West Germans.   ``But if we never forget the suffering caused by the BerlinWall, and if we keep recalling the happy faces and joy ofyesterday, we can master this challenge together,'' Momper said,speaking the day after the borders were thrown open.   After breaking off a politically sensitive trip to Poland, Kohlplanned an emergency meeting of the Cabinet Saturday to mapstrategy. At issue is how to proceed both at home and in regard tothe breakneck pace of changes in East Germany.   The chancellor told reporters the session will consider``necessary special measures,'' without elaborating.   Government sources, speaking to The Associated Press oncondition of anonymity, said Kohl also will try to speak with newEast German Communist Party leader, Egon Krenz, by telephone withinthe next few few days.   From a military standpoint, the two nations remain at theforefront of still officially hostile military alliances. WestGermany is the base for 250,000 U.S. troops, while nearly 400,000Soviet troops are based in East Germany.   The military element is vital to the increasingly frequentpredictions the latest shifts and uncertainty in East Germany willlead to a German reunification.   Neither Washington nor Moscow is likely to give up completelyits front-line ally any time soon, and German neutrality is a riskthat many in West Germany are unlikely to take.   Still, says conservative West German lawmaker Eduard Lintner:``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it willtake 10, 15 or 20 years. We have the impression that things aremuch more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.''   Any move toward reunification would cause unease and perhapsresistance in the Soviet Union, France, Britain and some otherEuropean countries.   A reunified Germany also would mean an enormous financialsacrifice for West Germany, as tax money from Bonn flowed eastwardto modernize increasingly outmoded factories and to clean up someof Europe's worst pollution.   Perhaps as an interim measure, Kohl increasingly has beendemanding democratic reforms in East Germany in direct exchange forBonn's financial aid, to keep East Germans from leaving in droves.   Kohl said while still in Warsaw that West Germany ``could beready to offer significant economic aid if the will to reformmanifested itself in East Germany.''   At times, it seems that as Kohl talks less and less about actualreunification the more the topic goes from a nostalgic dream intothe realm of serious discussion.   Kohl and his top aides also have increasingly been painting ableak picture for the East Germans who might want to come over. Itis another sign of growing stress for the government, the strappedsocial services and problems such as lack of housing for thenewcomers.   ``Every refugee must figure that he will have to live ininadequate housing for a fairly long time, and will probably beliving much worse than if he had stayed home,'' Interior MinisterWolfgang Schaeuble told parliament Thursday.   Schaeuble repeated the same warning the following day, althoughclaiming the East Germans still are welcome.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Kevin Costelloe has covered German and EastEuropean issues since June 1985 as Frankfurt News Editor of TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
