(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CD-ROM SystemsandM;A compact audio disk is just large enough to store a continuous performanceof Beethoven's Ninth Symphony -- a specification reportedly influenced by theJapanese, who like to play the Ninth on New Year's Day.andM;By way of comparison, the same-size CD-ROM disk holds a massive 550M of dataon its continuous three-mile track.andP;  But a CD-ROM also can store audio andvideo along with text and program data, either in the current CD-ROM formator in one of the emerging multimedia formats such as CD-ROM XA (extendedarchitecture).andM;That makes CD-ROM an excellent medium for training as well as for reference,publishing or simple data storage.andP;  However, the multimedia aspects of CD-ROMstill are evolving.andP;  Most offices do not yet have video and audio systems ofthe higher quality needed for multimedia applications.andM;One popular use is for clip art files.andP;  Clip art images stored in, say,Tagged-Image File Format (TIFF), can be treated like any other files onCD-ROM.andM;Unlike magnetic storage devices, a CD-ROM cannot be written to by the user.andO;Its costlier cousin, the write-once optical disk, ignores space once it hasbeen written over and cannot write over it again.andM;Cheap to DuplicateandM;Because creation of a CD-ROM disk coincides with storage of the data, it ispossible to replicate disks at low unit cost, approaching $2 each inquantity.andM;Only severe damage will make a disk unreadable.andP;  Environmental hazards likemagnetic fields, X-rays, moderate hat or extreme humidity, as well as oldage, do not hurt CD-ROM data as they do magnetically stored data.andP;  CD-ROMdisks also are immune to infection by computer viruses.andM;But CD-ROM's most obvious advantage as a storage or publishing medium remainsits sheer capacity.andP;  One disk holds as much data s nearly 400 high-densityfloppy disks.andM;Bear in mind that few desktop computers these days have 550M of hard-drivespace free.andP;  Nor is it convenient to transfer that much data on magneticmedia.andM;When people complain about the long access times of CD-ROM drives -- 350milliseconds up to 800 milliseconds, compared with only about 20 millisecondsfor a fast hard drive -- they ignore how long it would take to search out thesame amount of data in some other format.andM;Federal agencies' interest in CD-ROM falls into to areas: producing disks andusing them.andM;Even small departments of many agencies now do CD-ROM publishing.andP;  Withquantity production costs far lower than for paper publication of the samevolume of information, it has become feasible to publish on CD-ROM what usedto be too expensive to publish at all.andM;Taking advantage of package deals, agencies can publish 100 or so CD-rOMs forless than $5,000.andP;  With each disk capable of holding all the text fromseveral sets of encyclopedias, this kind of publishing obviously iscost-effective for huge amounts of data.andM;Unfortunately, because of the complexity of CD-rOM players, the price of thehardware to get access to the data has not dropped nearly as fast as the costof publishing.andM;Slowness Is RelativeandM;The relatively slow access time presents another barrier to acceptance ofCD-rOM as the standard medium for large quantities of data.andP;  Access times areunlikely to drop by more than half, if that much.andM;But remember that the 550M on a single CD-ROM represents more than all butthe largest and most expensive hard drives can hold.andP;  For moving aroundreally large amounts of data, CD-ROM is the only practical medium.andM;Moving 500M of files, roughly the size of the 12-volume Oxford EnglishDictionary, would take about a month with a 2,400-bit/sec modem over standardtelephone lines, and longer with error correction protocols.andP;  Some companiesnow routinely produce a finished CD-ROM with that much data in only a fewdays, saving time and telecommunications charges.andM;In the past, agencies that needed to transfer large amounts of data fast hadto ship their hard drives from one site to another.andM;Obviously, mass production of half a gigabyte of data on inexpensive, durableplastic disks is preferable to shipping costly and delicate hard drives.andM;Beyond the drive cost and access speed issues, CD-ROM publishing costs tendto be hard to pin down at the beginning of a project.andP;  Data collection andformatting potentially are hte most expensive tasks, actual pressing of thedisks the least expensive.andM;Although quotes for pressing 1,000 to 10,000 disks easily are available bytelephone, it can be tough to get a firm handle on data preparation costs.andM;People who have experience keying or scanning hundreds of thousands of pagesinto computer-usable form say these costs are both high and difficult toestimate.andP;  But if the data already is in electronic form, the greatestpotential cost is eliminated.andM;Costs Can Be TrickyandM;An agency equipped with a fast microcomputer and a large hard-drive capacitymay be able to manage the data preparation in-house, turning over thepressing to a plant like that of Nimbus Information Systems nearCharlottesville, Va.andM;Service bureaus also can do whatever work is necessary to produce a finishedCD-ROM.andP;  Some, such as DataWare of Cambridge, Mass., which has worked withthe Patent and Trademark Office, have entered into joint-venture agreementswith agencies to publish certain types of CD-ROMs.andM;Meridian Data Inc. in Scotts Valley, Calif., and Reston, Va., supplies CD-ROMdevelopment and multimedia hardware and software.andM;On-Line Computer Systems Inc. of Germantown, Md., has multimedia productionfacilities and expertise in disk creation, multidisk systems and CD-ROM onlocal area networks.andM;For agencies that want to publish secure documents on CD-ROM, Optical DiskMastering in Charlotte, N.C., sells the self-contained LHH-8000 CD IntegratedManufacturing System for about $5.5 million.andM;The system permits thre employees to master and replicate up to 8,000 disksper day without exceptional skill or advanced training.andM;All they need are new materials, a water supply and floor space measuring 60by 60 feet.andP;  The system maintains a clean-room environment.andM;Creating a CD-ROM has five steps: acquiring the data, editing it, indexing,premastering and physical production, which includes mastering, replicationand packaging.andP;  A contractor normally handles the last few steps.andM;Testing and error correction is necessary at several stages duringproduction.andP;  In some cases, there may be extra steps involving selection orcreation of a search engine and a user interface.andM;Specify the StepsandM;Not everyone in the CD-ROM industry agrees on just what happens in each ofthese steps, so one vital part of contract negotiation is to make certainthat all parties know exactly what form the data will take at the beginningand end of each step, with no gaps between stages.andM;Getting the data into computer-usable form will be the biggest challenge ifit already is not stored electronically.andP;  The precise format of the files aswell as the degree of accuracy required in conversion are vital points thatmust be addressed from the beginning of a project.andM;Optical character recognition sounds like a tempting alternative to rekeyingdata by hand.andP;  However, potential CD-ROM publishers should pay carefulattention to how accurate the automated conversion process will be, howsensitive the value of the data is to small errors, and how much it will costto check every scanned character where accuracy is paramount.andM;Even if data already is electronic, there almost certainly will be costs toget it into the correct format and fix any errors in the original data.andM;Editing data so that all of it conforms to the same format is another majortask that sometimes cna be automated.andP;  But it may take a great deal of humanintervention, depending on the nature of the original data.andM;However, graphics are easy to add without worrying about new multimediastandards, simply by capturing the images as TIFF or other standard files andstoring them on CD-ROM as data files.andM;Capturing GraphicsandM;Once everything is in the same format, it goes through the &quot;authoring&quot; orindexing step.andP;  This supplies tags or formatting codes to tell the datapreparation software where paragraphcs, pages, chapters and separatedocuments begin and end.andM;Premastering places the finished material on magnetic media, usuallynine-track computer tape, ready to be shipped to the pressing plant.andM;In mastering, the actual creation of a finished CD-ROM, a polished glass diskis covered with a photosensitive material, then &quot;cut&quot; by a modulated laserbeam controlled by the master tape.andM;The exposed disk then is developed and the exposed portions of the coatingare dissolved.andP;  finally, a heavy nickel plating of the master disk is removedto produce the &quot;stamper.&quot;andM;The replication step involves pressing the required number of polycarbonateplastic blanks in a vacuum forming machine, metallizing them with gold oraluminum and overcoating them.andP;  During the packaging step, labels are appliedand the disks are placed in containers.andM;Among federal agencies, the U.S.andP;  Geological Survey took an early lead in useof CD-ROM.andP;  Through the 3,000-member Special Interest Group on CD-ROMApplications and Technology (SIGCAT) chaired by USGS computer scientist JerryMcFaul, federal and private-sector members keep abreast of the latest CD-ROMdevelopments.andM;Other federal special interest groups affiliated with SIGCAT include SIGLIT,the SIG on Library Information Technology, whoc contact person is Susan Davidat the Library of Congress; and SIGACE, the SIG on Application of CD-ROM inEducation, whose contact is Sheldon Fisher at the Education Department.andM;The Hardware ChallengeandM;However, the vast majority of people who work with CD-ROMs do not productdisks but rather use the data.andP;  One challenge for them is putting togetherthe right access hardware.andM;CD-ROM drives, although similar to audio drives, have more rugged mechanicalcomponents and extra electronics.andP;  Just connecting a drive to a microcomputeris not enough to guarantee access to CD-ROM information; access requires asoftware driver not included in MS-DOS, because the Microsoft Corp. operatingsystem predated CD-ROM by many years.andM;But Microsoft's Extensions to MS-DOS can address a single CD-ROM as if itwere a single large, write-protected hard drive.andM;Slow access time, the commonest complaint of end users, probably will notdwindle by much because of the massive amount of data on a CD-ROM and thedisk's physical characteristics.andP;  But more important for many applications isthe actual time it takes to locate data.andM;There is lots of room for improvement in CD-ROM search time.andM;The speeds of different indexing and search methods very greatly, althoughthe very slowest works much faster than physically searching through printeddata.andP;  Many kinds of searches performed by CD-ROM access software areimpossible by any other means.andM;The Search Is OnandM;Consider a full-text search.andP;  It can find every occurrence of a word ornumber on an entire disk except for stopwords such as &quot;a,&quot; &quot;all&quot; and &quot;if.&quot;andO;It also finds Boolean combination of words.andM;For example, the monthly Computer Library disk from Ziff Communications Co.andO;of New York contains about 50,000 full-text articles and abstracts on thecomputer industry.andP;  Full-text search can turn up, say, every instance where&quot;VGA&quot; and &quot;color&quot; but not &quot;IBM&quot; occur in the same paragraph.andM;Full-text search represents a powerful research tool, which any standardindexing method applied to CD-ROMs probably would cripple.andP;  However, it ispossible to search for filenames on marginally indexed CD-ROMs, such as disksof shareware and freeware, with standard MS-DOS commands.andM;Access time really starts to mount when multiple networked users try tosearch a single CD-ROM.andP;  A number of network versions appear in this BuyersGuide chart.andM;Potential buyers should be aware that network licensing problems can bethorny.andP;  The reason is that no two publishers have exactly the same policyabout putting their disks on networks, although some companies now arestarting to sell their disks with unlimited user licenses.andM;At the other end of the access spectrum is the user who wants to run multipleCD-ROM drives off a single system.andP;  Probably no single CD-ROM can meeteveryone's data access needs; people who really get much use out of CD-ROMssoon want several.andM;Although it is possible to run most CD-ROMs in a Quarterdeck Office Systems'Desqview window, there seems to be no practical way to switch betweendifferent CD-ROMs in different windows.andM;That is unfortunate because of the long wait for the software to reload afterswapping the disks.andM;Many CD-ROM disks are meant to be accessed as stand-alone databases.andP;  Others,like Microsoft Corp.'s Bookshelf, can be memory-resident and interact with aword processor.andP;  Bookshelf contains a spelling checker and Bartlett'sFamiliar Quotations.andM;It also does such handy things as automatically locating a ZIP code to matchan address typed on the screen.andM;Specialized AlternativesandM;One alternative to buying an additional external drive for an existing systemis to buy another MS-DOS computer with a built-in CD-ROM drive.andP;  It does notsave a lot of money but does reduce installation problems.andM;HeadStart of Great Neck, N.Y., recently purchased by Philips International ofthe Netherlands, has what it calls the first MS-DOS computer on the marketwith a built-in CD-ROM drive.andM;The $1,500 LX-CD computer has been available since December.andP;  It is not thefirst one for sale, but it is the first to be mass-marketed.andM;The distinction of being first on the market should go to thetouch-screen-controlled DynaVision, formerly DynaBook, from Scenario Corp. inBoston.andP;  This portable 80286 with built-in CD-ROM, hard and floppy drives hasbeen available for more than a year.andM;Another system is the 20-pound gas plasma PC 3 from CD Technology Inc. of SanJose, Calif.andP;  Recently, Tandy Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, announced the RadioShack 286-based 2500 XL with an internal CD-ROM option.andM;Other less-known MS-DOS compatibles come with CD-ROM drives as standardequipment or options.andP;  Those like the Radio Shack, which feature full audiocapability and VGA graphics, are the ones to buy because they offermultimedia capability for the future.andM;Putting sound and video on a CD-ROM disk along with text and data under theCD-ROM XA standard does not require major new hardware.andP;  But it does demandan Adaptive Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) sound processor chip in the CD-ROMplayer.andM;The chip can be added to any player with audio capability.andM;Sound EffectsandM;XA is a superset of the CD-ROM specifications.andM;The ADPCM chip does audio compression for real-time reproduction of text,animation and audio.andP;  This allows up to 16 hours of speech-quality soundrecording or makes up to 16 different tracks, each with one hour in adifferent language.andP;  Because of limited processing power, XA restrictsgraphics to partial screen size.andM;Digital video-interactive (DV-I) is Intel Corp.'s proposed multimediastandard.andP;  Not surprisingly, it takes a lot of extra micro-processor power toachieve 72 minutes of full-screen video compression.andP;  DV-I reproductionhardware costs more than XA and is aimed at government and business use.andM;Compact disk-interactive (CD-I) is the consumer-level multimedia system beingdeveloped by Philips International and Sony Corp.andP;  The CD-I system putssound, video and data on the same disk but needs no general-purpose computer.andO;It is sefl-contained for everything from entertainment and learning tointeractive tour guides.andM;While multimedia certainly will become very important, for the moment its useis limited because of the lack of standards and the expense of multimediaplatforms with full VGA color graphics and stereo sound.andM;Also, multimedia production is far more complex than simple data publishingon a CD-ROM.andP;  It takes the same techniques and skills as producing a movie orTV documentary.andM;John McCormick, a free-lance writer and computer consultant, has been workingwith computers since the early 1960s.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
