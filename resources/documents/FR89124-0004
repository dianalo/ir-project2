This actionconstitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectivenessof these regulations under those procedures. The sunset review date forthese regulations is June 1, 1993.John Marshall, Manager, FCIC, (1) has determined that this action is nota major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291 because it will not resultin: (a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) majorincreases in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,State, or local governments, or a geographical region, or (c) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets; and (2) certifies that thisaction will not increase the federal paperwork burden for individuals,small businesses, and other persons and will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.This action is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct; therefore, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.<ITAG tagnum="21">This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.450.</ITAG>This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR29115, June 24, 1983.This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an EnvironmentalAssessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.FCIC herewith adds a new Part 406 in Chapter IV of Title 7, Code of FederalRegulations to be known as the Nursery Crop Insurance Regulations (7 CFRPart 406), effective for the 1989 and succeeding crop years, to providethe provisions for insuring nursery crops. This rule authorizes the offerof insurance directly through FCIC which previously had been availableonly through an FCIC reinsured company.On Friday, September 23, 1988, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemakingin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 36985, to prescribe procedures for insuringnursery crops in counties approved by the Board of Directors of FCIC, andprovide for codification of the Nursery Crop policy of insurance in 7 CFRPart 406 in the Code of Federal Regulations.The public was given 30 days in which to submit written comments, data,and opinions on the proposed rule. Two comments were received from theAmerican Association of Nurserymen and the Florists' Mutual Insurance Company.In each case the commenters expressed concern that the insurance whichcurrently is offered to prospective insureds through companies under aReinsurance Agreement with FCIC, was proposed to be offered through companiesunder an Agency Sales and Service Contract. The major concern in all commentsreceived centers on the ability of the agency sales and service networkto properly market a very technical and complicated program. Another concernis the limitation of coverage to 75 percent of average yield as the maximumcoverage offered by FCIC.In direct communication with the commenters, FCIC has assured each thatit is aware of the wide differences between nursery crops and other cropsit insures. FCIC will train all its personnel in the intricacies of nurserycrop production, and will train, test, and certify all agents before thatare permitted to sell nursery crop insurance under the agency Sales andService Contract. With respect to the comment regarding the values of nurserycrop acreages as far exceeding the value of other crops insured by FCIC,concern was expressed that the 25 percent loss deductible (expressed asthe 75 percent maximum coverage limit on all FCIC programs) is not a viablecoverage because of the higher values mentioned above.The mandate of the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 is that FCIC willnot make available to producers any level of coverage in excess of theseventy-five percent level, thus negating the possibility of a higher levelof coverage which may be perceived as protection of the profit margin offarming, while undergirding the basic concept of the insurance proposal;to protect the investment made by the insured in producing the crop toenable such producer to keep farming in the face of unavoidable naturaldisasters.Further, the expansion of the insurance offer to producers serviced bycompanies under an Agency Sales and Service Contract fully implements theprovisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act in employing a dual deliverysystem to better serve all producers.Finally, one of the commenters referred to three dates in the proposedrule, one of which is the Sunset Review date of June 1, 1993. This dateis the 5-year projection under the procedures established by DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1. These provide that a review as to the need, currency,clarity, and effectiveness of these regulations must be conducted beforesuch date in order to permit them to continue in existence.The second date referred to, found in andSection; 406.7(b), provides theauthority for the extension of the sales closing date for accepting applicationsbeyond the September 30th deadline. This authority is a standard provisionused by FCIC under controlled circumstances and is immediately rescindedin the event of the possibility of adverse selectivity.The final date of concern to this commenter is the June 30th deadline forfiling policy changes in the service offices. The commenters expressedconcern that this date seriously hampers the activities of agents betweenJune 30 and the September 30 deadline for accepting applications on thebasis that, while this period may be adequate for other crops insured byFCIC, it is not sufficient time to consider the enormous variety of differentplants grown on a nursery farm.FCIC considered this question very carefully and verified its findingswith the Crop Hail Insurance Actuarial Association. The final determinationis that 90 days is a reasonable time in which to allow agents to completepreparations and to sell policies to prospective insureds.For the reason stated above, FCIC contemplates no changes to the rule asproposed at 53 FR 36985, and herewith adopts such rule as a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 406</ITAG>Crop insurance, Nursery crop.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop InsuranceAct, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation adds a new Part406 in Chapter IV of Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, to be knownas 7 CFR Part 406_Nursery Crop Insurance Regulations, effective for the1989 and succeeding crop years, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 406_NURSERY CROP INSURANCE REGULATIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart: Regulations for the 1989 and Succeeding Crop Years</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">406.1 Availability of nursery crop insurance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">406.2 Premium rates, amounts of insurance, and coverage levels atwhich indemnities shall be computed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">406.3 OMB control numbers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">406.4 Creditors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">406.5 Good faith reliance on misrepresentation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">406.6 The contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">406.7 The application and policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 7 U.S.C. 1506, 1516.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 406.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Availability of nursery crop insurance.</ITAG>(a) Insurance shall be offered under the provisions of this subpart onthe insured crop in counties within the limits prescribed by and in accordancewith the provisions of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended, (theAct).
