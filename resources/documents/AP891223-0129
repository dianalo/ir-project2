Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The reinforcements, including a helicopter company, were sentfrom the Army's 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif.,and joined 24,000 other U.S. soldiers, many of them bone-weary, onDay Four of the nation's largest combat operation since the VietnamWar.   It is an operation that has turned quickly from the conventionalwarfare of the initial strike, which virtually neutralized thePanamanian Defense Forces, to the more perplexing mission ofcountering guerrilla attacks and policing a nation in institutionalchaos.   The Pentagon reported that 25 U.S. servicemen, four more thanlisted Friday, had been killed in the fighting. Officials also saidtwo American dependents had been killed, 241 U.S. troops had beenwounded and one was still missing.   The military said 139 members of the PDF had been killed, and 95wounded. There was no official count of casualties among Panamaniancivilians.   U.S. forces said they had recovered 15,500 weapons, including 33armored vehicles, with an increasing number of arms laid downvoluntarily by surrendering members of the Panamanian DefenseForces, including the garrison which guarded the presidentialpalace. The number of PDF detainees totaled 2,250, according toGen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command.   Despite the massive recovery of weapons, commanders saidNoriega's ``dignity battalions'' continued to draw fresh arms andammunition for hit-ad-run attacks upon troops and civilians.   One American officer said the loyalists of the self-styled``maximum leader'' _ whose whereabouts remained undetermined _ hadused ambulances to shuttle their weaponry around Panama City.   Still, Thurman, briefing reporters in Panama, offered severalbits of ``good news'' late in the day. He said:   _Nine employees of Evergreen International Airlines, an Americancargo carrier, had been released by pro-Noriega forces andevacuated by U.S. troops to the safety of Howard AFB. According toThurman, the airline employees had been stripped to their underwearand beaten, but were not seriously hurt.   _The effort to create a new Panamanian police force under thenew, U.S.-installed government of Guillermo Endara was proceedingat an encouraging pace. ``Today we brought down 750 uniforms and1,000 people showed up,'' he said.   ``The people are cooperating with us and are beginning to laydown their weapons,'' the general said. In areas torn both bylooting and combat, he said, ``people are ... cleaning up thedebris.''   CBS News, meanwhile, reported that CBS producer JonathanMeyersohn, who had been held by pro-Noriega forces since the earlyhours of the U.S. assault, had been released.   Thurman, while stressing progress in the effort to pacify thePDF, conceded ``that does not mean we're over and done with withthe dignity battalions,'' the guerrilla-styled irregulars stillloyal to Noriega.   The Southern Command also reported that prisoners at an islandpenitentiary in the Pacific, about 60 miles from the capital,apparently had overcome their pro-Noriega guards and had radioedfor help from American forces. The prison group was said to includesome of the former Panamanian officers who led a failed coupattempt on Oct. 3.   Lt. Col. Jerry Marguila, spokesman for the Southern Command,said Saturday that the dignity battalions were ``increasing theiractivities _ of harassing attacks with small arms and mortar fire,threatening the civilian population, and hostage-taking.''   Pressed for specifics, Marguila replied ``I don't have in mymind an increase in numbers between today and yesterday ofdignity-battalion efforts. It's just that they are becoming more ofa concern, because they are taking more of our time as opposed tothe PDF.''   At the Pentagon, one military official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, conceded the ferocity of the dignity battalions hadcaught U.S. commanders off guard.   A Pentagon spokesman also said the F-117 stealth fighter-bomberwas among the new weapons used for the first time during combat inthe Panama attack. Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist said the plane, whichis designed to evade enemy radar, was used successfully on onemission, bombing a field near a PDF barracks to create ``confusionand alarm'' among the enemy.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was at his office on Saturday tokeep tabs on developments in Panama as well as the bloodyrevolution which ousted Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.President Bush was at Camp David, Md., where he worked on aChristmas Eve address to the American military men and women aroundthe globe, including a ``special message'' for those in Panama.   Bush planned to tape the Armed Services Network broadcast at thePentagon on Sunday, where he also was to receive an extendedbriefing on the Panama fighting.   Bush was briefed by telephone Saturday by national securityadviser Brent Scowcroft on both Panama and Romania.   The president plans to go to a Houston hospital on Dec. 31 tovisit soldiers wounded in Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
