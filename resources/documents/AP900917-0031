The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost177.62 points Friday, shed another 531.865 points, or 2.13 percent,to close at 24,365.60.   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-yearJapanese government bonds continued to rise. They were quoted at8.570 percent at 3:00 p.m. after Friday's 8.460-percent close, thehighest yield the bond has ever reached. The price was lower at81.17 points from 81.62.   The dollar closed at 137.00 yen, up 0.45 yen from Friday's closeof 136.55 yen. After opening lower at 136.45 yen, the currencyranged between 136.43 yen and 137.10 yen.   The yen fell against the U.S. and European currencies asinvestors sold the yen in an attempt to correct overboughtpositions, said Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New JapanSecurities Co. The dollar started lower following its downtrend inthe Sydney market, which opens earlier than Tokyo.   ``Institutional investors had bought the yen and soldsubstantial amounts of European and U.S. currencies before theirsettling their accounts for the first half of fiscal 1990,'' hesaid.   On Monday, such investors bought the dollar at around 136.40 to136.50 yen to make up their short, or oversold, positions, he said.   ``Weakness in the bond and the stock market also contributed tothe yen's weakness,'' Kanai said.   But he said the Japanese currency's weakness Monday is just abrief correction.   On the stock exchange, traders said the index fell as soon asthe market opened because investors discouraged by the weakeninggovernment bond market and began index-linked large-scale selling.   They also said announcement of a price increase by major oilwholesalers also discouraged investors.</TEXT></DOC>
