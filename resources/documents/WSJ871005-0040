BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   France appears to be moving toward a rejection of Japanese charges that a defunct French company, Ratier-Forest S.A., once sold sensitive machine tools to the Soviet Union.    If France does fail to confirm the Japanese charges, it could add fresh fuel to the controversy that began when Toshiba Corp. admitted that its machine-tool unit, in conjunction with Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS, sold equipment to the Soviets that the U.S. says helped them build quieter propellers for their nuclear submarines. The controversy touched France about a month ago, when the Japanese company said its Toshiba Machine unit had sold the equipment only after learning that the French already had sold machine tools to the Soviets in violation of Western rules.    An official at the U.S. Defense Department, where aides have expressed private concern over the charges, said the U.S. would withhold official comment until France completes its investigation, which the French hope to do within a few weeks. But privately, a U.S. official said it would be &quot;disappointing&quot; if the charges were simply rejected. Another U.S. official has told reporters that he is convinced that Ratier-Forest did export prohibited machines. To date, however, U.S. officials have said they don't themselves have any evidence.    U.S. officials so far have taken a much lower-key approach to the accusations against France than they have to the Toshiba revelations, which prompted proposals in Congress to impose tough sanctions against the Japanese company and led the Commerce Department to suspend Toshiba's license to buy U.S. high-technology products in bulk.    French officials said they have confirmed that Ratier-Forest delivered seven or eight milling machines to the Soviets from 1975 through 1977, as alleged by Toshiba. The machines are metal-working devices that can be used, among other things, to build ship parts. But French officials said these particular machines seem to have been relatively simple ones whose export isn't restricted.    The French said that because Ratier-Forest and a successor company both went bankrupt, records are spotty and incomplete. Efforts are continuing to track down executives involved, to find fuller records and to try to discover whether existing records could have been falsified. But so far, the French officials said, they aren't finding any evidence that the equipment exported was of the sophisticated sort whose export to communist countries is forbidden by agreement of the major non-communist countries.    &quot;We think this was a diversionary maneuver by the Japanese firm,&quot; to distract attention from Toshiba's sale, said a French official involved in the investigation here.    French officials said that they nevertheless are checking, machine by machine, all the machine-tool sales made to the Soviets by Ratier-Forest and its two successor companies, the latest of which -- Machines Francaises Mourdes -- is continuing to export to the Soviet Union. That, the French said, involves dozens of machines. What's more, they said they also are checking other sales, about which they don't give details, which they said also might be challenged.    Privately, some French officials say they aren't very concerned about the entire issue. Some say they aren't even persuaded of the link between the Toshiba sales and Soviet advances in propeller technology. And they maintain that even if Ratier-Forest did violate Cocom regulations in the mid-1970s, the violation probably wasn't a major one. Ratier-Forest, says another French official, never was a world leader.    &quot;I don't want to denigrate French technology,&quot; says this official, &quot;but it simply isn't at the level of what Toshiba sold.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
