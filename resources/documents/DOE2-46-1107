Low temperature waste heat resources potentialin the twenty three wards, Tokyo and their area distributions have beeninvestigated. There is an enormous potential in the heart of Tokyo andthe bay side areas, and the thermal power stations and the sewage-treatmentplants are main heat sources. Meanwhile, in case of the substations,the facilities are distributed in wide areas. However, waste heat quantityper a substation is small, even in total quantities, they are far smallerthan that of sewage-treatment plants and refuse incinerators. Possibilitiesof utilization of low temperature waste heat on heating and hot watersupply were investigated in aspect of supply and demand balance and thelocations. For the conduct of detail case study, specified areas wereselected. A system plan of the subject areas was made and the energyconservation was evaluated. As a result, About 40 % reduction of an annualconsumption of energy was estimated by waste heat supply system in comparisonwith conventional individual heating system. (6 figs, 4 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
