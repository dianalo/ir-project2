The assessment provides a basis for theconclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineered tomatoplants will not present a risk of introduction or dissemination of a plantpest and will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animaland Plant health Inspection Service has determined that an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505 BelcrestRoad, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Michael Schectman, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Department of Agriculture,Room 845, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782,(301) 436-8761.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Calgene, Inc., of Davis, California, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment, to field test genetically engineeredtomato plants modified to express an anti-sense endopolygalacturonase (PG)RNA.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tomato plant under the conditions describedin the Calgene, Inc., application. APHIS concluded that the field testingwill not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination andwill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Calgene, Inc., as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. An endopolygalacturonase gene from tomato has been modified and insertedinto a tomato chromosome in such a way as to produce anti-sense RNA. Inthis field trial none of the introduced genes can spread to another plant,because the field test plot is located at a sufficient distance from anysexually compatible plant with which an experimental tomato plant couldcross-pollinate. In nature, genetic material contained in a chromosomecan only be transferred to another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollinationand fertilization.2. Neither the modified endopolygalacturonase gene itself, nor the derivedanti-sense RNA, confers on tomato any plant pest characteristic. The tomatocultivar (UC82B) from which the endopolygalacturonase gene was obtainedis not a plant pest.3. The anti-sense PG gene does not provide the transformed tomato plantswith any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed tomato plantsin their ability to be disseminated or to become established in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the anti-sense endopolygalacturonase geneto tomato plants has been evaluated for its use in this specific experimentand does not pose a plant pest risk therein. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pathogenic potential, has been disarmed:that is, the genes that are necessary for pathogenicity have been removed.The vector has been tested and shown to be not pathogenic to a susceptibleplant.5. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium that was used to deliverthe vector DNA carrying the anti-sense endopolygalacturonase gene intoa tomato plant cell, was eliminated and is no longer associated with atransformed tomato plant.6. Horizontal movement of genetic material after insertion into the plantgenome (I.E., into chromosomal DNA) has not been demonstrated. After deliveringand inserting the DNA to be transferred into the tomato genome, the vectordoes not survive in or on the transformed plant. No mechanism is knownto exist in nature to move an inserted gene horizontally from a chromosomeof a transformed plant to any other organism.7. The field test plot will be approximately 180 feet by 780 feet, andwill be planted in part with the tomato plants described herein and inpart with other genetically engineered tomato plants for which a separatepermit is pending. The test tomato plants will be separated by a sufficientdistance (200 feet) from any other cultivated tomatoes to preclude cross-pollinationwith those plants.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384 and 44 Fr 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, D.C., this 25th day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
