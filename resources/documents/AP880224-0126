ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole was riding high todayafter twin victories over George Bush in Midwestern preludes tonext month's Super Tuesday showdowns, but Bush brushed off hislosses. Democrats Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis swappedvictories and said they were eager to carry their battle to theSouth.   Meanwhile, Democrat Paul Simon said today he would bypass theMarch 8 collection of 20 primaries and caucuses, citing a lack ofmoney and the belief that Super Tuesday would result ``in a verymixed picture.''   ``The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting inIllinois'' on March 15, the Illinois senator told reporters inWashington.   Republican Pat Robertson, campaigning in Georgia, said the newsstaff at his Christian Broadcasting Network once knew thewhereabouts of hostages in Beirut _ proving, he said, they couldhave been rescued.   The U.S. reaction to terrorism, Robertson said, ``has to bequick, and it has to be a surprise. ... We identified in our newsdepartment at CBN the location of those hostages in Lebanon veryshortly after they were taken, and they were in a position wherethey could have been rescued. They were in Beirut, and they couldhave been freed.''   Robertson, asked if he had informed the Reagan administration,said, ``I broadcast it on national television; they monitor ourprograms virtually every day.''   Bush brushed off his losses in South Dakota and Minnesota,saying today after arriving to campaign in Portland, Maine, ``Youcan't win them all.''   The vice president, who made virtually no effort in the twoupper Midwestern states, said, ``I think the result was somewhatanticipated; you can't go everywhere.'' He added, ``We've done wellout there. We've won in Michigan and in Nevada.''   Tuesday night, Dukakis said after splitting the two upperMidwestern contests with Gephardt, ``This is a marathon. It's goingto be a long one.''   The Massachusetts governor won in Minnesota on Tuesday, anddealt Simon a crushing defeat. Gephardt was the winner in SouthDakota with Dukakis a respectable second.   Dole won both states going away _ with Bush far, far behind. InMinnesota, the vice president finished fourth behind Robertson andRep. Jack Kemp. In South Dakota, with Dole winning all 18 of thedelegates at stake, Bush was narrowly edged for second place byRobertson.   The former television evangelist said today in Atlanta, ``Thishelps me enormously as I go into the Super Tuesday states.'' Headded, ``I believe that coming out of Super Tuesday I will be theacknowledged front-runner of the Republican Party with delegates.''   Wasting no time before heading for the next battleground, Dolewas flying to South Carolina today for four quick campaignappearances.   ``I hope it can help me in the South,'' Dole said of his latestvictories. ``I've got a big hill to climb in the South.''   Bush was buried in the Tuesday night returns, running third inSouth Dakota and fourth in Minnesota. After his embarrassing defeattwo weeks ago in Iowa, Bush chose to head South rather than take onDole again in the Midwest.   It was up one week and down the next in the GOP race. AfterDole's strong Iowa showing, Bush bounced back to win the NewHampshire primary a week ago. This was Dole's week again, but nowthe scene shifts to the South, where Bush is regarded as thefront-runner.   Gephardt and Dukakis were quick to hail their Midwest victories.   ``This...was a great victory that we have had in South Dakota,''said the Missouri congressman.   Dukakis, who finished second in South Dakota, said, ``I thinkit's very good news for us because we've finished strong in everyone of these states.''   Also able to claim a measure of victory was Democrat JesseJackson, who was leading Simon for second place in Minnesota.   One-time Democratic front-runner Gary Hart also had a thumbsdown for his lonely campaign to ``let the people decide.'' Hart got5 percent of the vote in South Dakota and 1 percent in Minnesota.Unable to get 10 percent of the vote in two consecutive primaries,Hart stands to lose his eligibility for federal matching funds.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee described his third-placefinish in South Dakota as a ``pleasant surprise,'' though he workedhard in the state and got just 8 percent of the vote.   In returns from all but one of South Dakota's 1,151 precincts,Dole had 51,529 or 55 percent of the vote compared to 18,275 orjust under 20 percent for Robertson and 17,416 or 19 percent forBush. Kemp trailed with 5 percent.   That meant Dole led for all of the state's 18 delegates to theRepublican National Convention in New Orleans next summer.Robertson was just short of qualifying for delegates with oneprecinct's votes uncounted.   None of the other three contests was directly allocatingdelegates, although each of the winners was getting an edge in theprocess.   With all but one of the Democratic precincts reporting in SouthDakota, Gephardt had 31,226 or 44 percent and Dukakis 22,367 or 31percent. The also rans were Gore at 8 percent, Simon at 6 percentand Hart and Jackson at 5 percent each.   In Minnesota, Republican results from 80 percent of theprecincts gave Dole 43 percent to 28 percent for Robertson. Kempwas third with 15 percent and Bush was running fourth with 11percent.   The Democratic caucus procedure in Minnesota was complicated andreturns were still trickling in well past midnight. With 74 percentof the precincts reporting, Dukakis had 34 percent of the vote.Jackson had just under 20 percent, with 19 percent uncommitted.Simon had 18 percent, while Gephardt had 7 percent. Hart and Gorehad 1 percent each.</TEXT></DOC>
