Gromyko, the stone-faceddiplomat who served Kremlin leaders from Josef Stalin to Mikhail S.Gorbachev, retired from the Politburo today in a move that likelyset the stage for his removal from the presidency.   Gromyko's retirement came on the first day of a meeting of thepolicy-making Communist Party Central Committee and one day beforea special session of the Supreme Soviet, the nation's nominalparliament.   His retirement from the president's post could clear the way forGorbachev to assume the presidency in a reorganization of CommunistParty and government functions.   The shake-up in the Kremlin hierarchy virtually removedholdovers appointed by Gorbachev's predecessors.   There was initial confusion over Gromyko's status. In his speechto the session, Gorbachev said Gromyko had requested he be allowedto retire on pension, indicating he would step down from thePolitburo and the presidency.   But it appeared that Gromyko could ask the party CentralCommittee only to relieve him of his Politburo job. The question ofwhether he will remain as head of state could be be taken up onlyby the parliament at Saturday's meeting.   Vadim A. Medvedev, Centrtal Committee spokesman, said Gromykohad been thinking of retiring for some time, and asked to berelieved of his duties.   Gorbachev lauded the ``the merits and achievements'' of Gromyko,who served as Soviet foreign minister for 27 years before becomingpresident in July 1985.   Tass, the Soviet news agency, said Gorbachev told the CentralCommittee that Gromyko had submitted a request saying that at hisage ``the only sensible decision for me is to retire.''   His statement said he wanted ``to go every day in the commonrank together with the entire party, with the entire people.''   ``Generally speaking, it has been a rich political life,''Gorbachev said. ``I would like to thank him ... for the great workand faithful service for the party and the state, and to wish himgood health.''   The 79-year-old Gromyko is a skillful and tough diplomat whorepresented the Kremlin in negotiations with Western leaders fromWinston Churchill to President Jimmy Carter.   He taught the West the meaning of the Russian word ``nyet''during the Cold War but quickly accommodated himself to detente inthe 1970s and was considered a key supporter when Gorbachev assumedthe leadership of the Communist Party in 1985.   Many have called him ``Grim Grom'' or ``Old Stoneface.'' Heoutlasted Stalin, Nikita S. Khrushchev, Leonid I. Brezhnev, Yuri V.Andropov and Kostantin U. Chernenko, all leaders of the SovietUnion.   His long tenure attests to a competence that enabled him tosurvive the political upheavals in the Soviet Union.   ``As a thoroughly professional practitioner of the diplomatictrade, he has few peers in the modern world,'' Cyrus R. Vance, thenthe U.S. secretary of state, said in 1978.   Gromyko served as a loyal foreign minister to all Sovietleaders, but during Andropov's leadership in 1982-84, Gromyko'sstar rose. In March 1983, he became first deputy premier inaddition to his post as foreign minister and member of thePolitburo.   Tass once said he took part in ``the most important foreignpolitical developments of our time.''   Gromyko held some of his government's most demanding posts andattended every U.S.-Soviet summit except the one in November 1985,between Gorbachev and President Reagan. That was because he nolonger was foreign minister.   Gromyko was named ambassador to the United States in 1943 at theage of 34.   He attended the conferences of the Allies in Tehran, Potsdam andYalta where Stalin, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime MinisterWinston Churchill of Britain and Chiang Kai-shek of China madeimportant wartime and postwar decisions.   In 1946, Gromyko was named the Soviet Union's permamentrepresentative to the United Nations, the world body he helpedfound during his years in Washington.   In his three years as a permanent representative on the U.N.Security Council, Gromyko cast 26 vetoes, sounding out his ``nyet''when it came his turn to vote.   He gained the sobriquet ``Old Stoneface'' in 1960 whenKhrushchev raucously banged his shoe on his desk during a U.N.General Assembly session, startling everyone in the hall _ exceptGromyko, who sat silently staring ahead.   In June, a delegate to the Communist Party conference bluntlycriticized Gromyko and other longtime officeholders, suggestingthere was high-level support for removing them from office.</TEXT></DOC>
