Marquis Who's Who Inc. publishes a three-volume, 4,600-page Directory of Medical Specialties listing more than 300,000 physicians certified by one or more of 14 medical specialty boards. The directory is broken down by specialty and geographic area, making it easy to find, say, all the board-certified dermatologists in Scranton, Pa., (there are two) or gynecologists in Oroville, Calif. (one).    Another directory is the American Board of Medical Specialties Compendium of Certified Medical Specialists which, in seven volumes and about 10,000 pages, lists 337,105 doctors in alphabetical order, and by specialty and geographic location.    Both publications list the doctor's age, medical school, date of certification, address of practice and hospital where staff privileges are held. The Who's Who also provides a doctor's career path, a bit of information that might be useful to those who know the relative merits of particular hospitals.    For instance, a surgeon who served at an inner-city public hospital probably has seen a variety of severe, life-threatening emergencies -- and is as qualified, perhaps more so, as the surgeon who trained at a big-name facility serving a higher-income population. On the other hand, doctors who trained at such institutions as Harvard or the Mayo Clinic can be expected to have a high level of expertise in selected areas.    Donald Langsley, executive vice president of the American Board of Medical Specialties, says that roughly 30% of doctors who claim to be specialists aren't certified by a specialty board, and thus won't be found in the directories. Although a lack of certification shouldn't necessarily disqualify a doctor, patients ought to ask why certification wasn't received. </TEXT></DOC>
