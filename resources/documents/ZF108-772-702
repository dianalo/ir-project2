T1200 8086 laptop runnign at 9.54 MHz, with 1MRAM and a 20M hard drive as the remote computer and an AST Premium 386/25from AST Research Inc. of Irvine, Calif., as the host.andP;  An internal Toshiba2,400-bit/sec modem was in the laptop, with a Hayes 2400 external on thedesktop host.andM;In addition to its logical menu-driven format, ease of installation isclearly one of Co/Session Version 4.0's brightest features.andP;  It took lessthan 10 minutes apiece to install the program on both the remote and the hostPCs.andP;  Within half an hour of opening the box, I had the program up andrunning, accessing files on the host PC.andP;  Co/Session installs on both thehost and remote PC using just five instructions.andM;Rarely is ease of installation the most important feature in a program.andO;Because remote control programs commonly are used in PC support where thesupporter is several states away from the user, this factor is magnified.andO;Co/Session gets running easier than Carbon Copy Plus from Microcom Inc. ofIrvine, Calif., the original and most popular remote controller.andM;Despite the effortless installation, I did run into a few hitches.andP;  First,the password field in the Phone Book Menu is case-sensitive.andP;  I set up thepassword in uppercase on the host, but the program did not recognize the samepassword when I entered it in lower case on the remote PC.andP;  When I changedcthe case on the password the program let me access the host PC just as if Iwere sitting right in front of it.andM;I also had a problem with scrolling and slow screen updates while runningprograms on the host.andP;  Connecting to and displaying messages on the host'selectronic mail system took more than 10 seconds and the system took evenlonger to redraw each screen on the remote.andP;  This proved troublesome whenretrieving long messages.andP;  It took 10 seconds to bring up Lotus 1-2-3 fromthe host's link to a network server, and it took eight seconds to bring upthe program from the host's hard drive.andP;  Bringing up WordPerfect 5.0 from thehost's link to a network server took about 12 seconds over the Co/Sessionlink, while it took under four seconds doing it at the host.andM;However, the trouble shooting section in the package's documentation provedvery useful in this situation.andP;  The trouble shooting documentation suppliedspecific information on configuration items to tweak.andP;  Once the fixes were inplace all the response times listed above were cut nearly in half andscrolling speed doubled.andM;File transfers were simple to do, requiring just a few menu choices, but thechoices were not obvious.andP;  It took a little fiddling to figure out how to doit the first time.andM;Co/Session application requires between 51K and 105K of memory.andP;  The Supportor remote program requires 125K of memory.andP;  It runs on IBM PCs andcompatibles uner MS-DOS 2.0 or higher and requires a Hayes orHayes-comaptibel modem.andP;  The package sells for $249 for both the remote andhost programs.andM;Co/Session Version 4.0 includes new features such as an improved, pop-upwindow user interface, EGA, VGA and Hercules graphics support, reduced memoryrequirement for the application version, expanded phone directory andoptional host screen blanking.andM;Triton Technologies Inc.
