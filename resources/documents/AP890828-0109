(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A prosecutor said today that PTL founderJim Bakker lied to his followers to cheat them out of their money,but defense lawyers said Bakker had a ``creative, religious genius''and stands unfairly accused.   ``The motive was dollars,'' prosecutor Jerry Miller told jurorsin opening statements at Bakker's federal court trial. ``The motivewas opulence. The motive was a lavish lifestyle most of you won't beable to identify with.''   As the trial opened, the leadoff prosecution witness was formerBakker aide David Taggart, who testified that Bakker was a hands-onadministrator who worked on the ministry fund-raising programs evenon vacation.   Taggart, who was convicted last month of committing tax evasionduring the time he was Bakker's personal assistant, said Bakker wasinvolved in much of the ministry's promotional activities includingfund-raising letters and brochures.   Taggart and his brother James, who was PTL's interior decoratorand was also convicted of tax evasion, each face 25 years in prisonand $1 million in fines at a Sept. 8 sentencing. David Taggart saidhe testified today because, ``I thought it might have some impact onmy sentencing in the future.''   Bakker is being tried on 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy.Prosecutors say he and other executives of the PTL televisionministry diverted for their own benefit at least $4 million of the$158 million they raised for ``lifetime partnerships'' at theministry's resort hotels.   In his 40-minute presentation to the jury, Miller said Bakker``used untruth and half-truth'' to get people to send money for thepartnerships in PTL.   ``This case is about cheating people out of their money, trickingpeople out of their money by the use of the mails, telephone andtelevision,'' Miller said.   Defense lawyer George T. Davis spoke an hour and 15 minutes,saying there was no evidence that Bakker sold anything or had anycriminal intent to defraud people.   ``We will prove that there was not a sale of one singlemembership or lifetime partnership,'' Davis said. ``What happenedwas gifts or donations. This was a church. This was an outreachprogram.   ``Whether you believe Jim Bakker was divinely inspired or not, hehad a divine inspiration and that was the Heritage Foundation. Itwas the product of a creative, religious genius. That was JimBakker's contribution to the Christian faith he believed in.''   While Bakker was in court, his wife Tammy carried on theirtelevision broadcast from Orlando, Fla., where the Bakkers movedafter their PTL empire collapsed.   ``If there was any way I could be there I would be there, but wehave a program to keep on the air,'' Mrs. Bakker said, adding thather son, Jamie Charles, started school today. ``I want Jim to havesomething to come back to.''   If convicted of all 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakkercould be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million.   ``I was a pastor, and a businessman I was not,'' said Bakker intestimony during a lawsuit last summer. Bakker, who says he isinnocent, and his attorney, Davis, have declined to discuss theirdefense strategy.   Bakker, 49, resigned from PTL in March 1987 after revelationsabout his sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and a$265,000 payoff to buy her silence. Three months after Bakkerresigned, PTL was put under bankruptcy protection.   Outside the courthouse today, about 50 journalists and cameramenwaited, hoping to get one of the two rows of seats reserved for newsmedia. Other journalists signed up for one of the 28 spectator seatsin the small courtroom.   Two men from Columbia, S.C., carried picket signs denouncingBakker and several other television evangelists.   One of the pickets, Bob Eckhardt, said he and David Hallmandidn't represent a specific denomination. ``We just want people toknow God isn't playing games. Anybody who reads the Bible knew that(PTL) wasn't right,'' Eckhardt said.   In a sentencing hearing for former PTL Vice President RichardDortch last week, prosecutors gave a glimpse at their case againstBakker.   Dortch, Bakker's top assistant from 1984 to 1987, pleaded guiltyto four fraud and conspiracy charges in a bargain that requires himto testify against Bakker. He was sentenced to eight years in prisonand fined $200,000.   At Dortch's sentencing hearing, prosecutors set up large chartsshowing PTL raised $158 million between 1984 and 1987 throughpartnerships that promised supporters who gave $1,000 three nightslodging per year for life in hotels being constructed at HeritageUSA, PTL's expansive retreat and park near here.   Money was diverted to support the Bakkers' extravagant lifestyle,the prosecutors said. During those years, Bakker and his wife,Tammy, drew $3.5 million in bonuses plus other perks, and otherfunds were used for day-to-day operations at PTL, prosecutors said.   The government contended that nearly half of the money raisedthrough lifetime partnerships _ $74.2 million _ was for the TowersHotel project, but only $11.4 million was actually spent on theunfinished 20-floor hotel.   In another lifetime partnership plan, the 1100 Club, 492,000people were offered the chance to buy partnerships and take theirchoice of ``brand new'' lodgings at Farmland USA.   According to the charts, 7,783 people bought partnerships withdonations of $1,100 each, but only one ``bunkhouse'' with 16 roomswas built. Only eight of those rooms were designated for lifetimepartners.   Tapes of PTL's television program, which were reviewed by a grandjury and will be shown to Bakker's jury, show Bakker and Dortchpromising that there was a limit of 30,000 lifetime partnerships inthe Towers project.   But government auditors said 68,755 partnerships were sold.   ``Mr. Bakker and Mr. Dortch later told viewers of theirtelevision show that 900 additional partnerships had opened upbecause of people who had not made good on their pledges,'' JusticeDepartment prosecutor Deborah Smith told U.S. District Judge RobertPotter on Thursday.   She said that sales pitch was an example of the ``calculatedattempts'' by Bakker and Dortch to mislead their viewers and the PTLboard about the ministry's financial condition.   ``Mr. Dortch presented himself as a religious leader and man ofGod while lying to them to induce them to send in their money,'' shesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
