However, longwall shearersexperience many of the same problems as continuous miners in the processof cutting coal. Chief among these are a high percentage of down timedue to vibrational wear and tear on the machines, high cutting tool wear,unacceptable dust levels, and a high percentage of product fines. Whena longwall shearer cuts coal, the cutting forces are usually more thanadequate to keep vibration to a minimum and cutting tool wear is nottoo high. However, when the shearer encounters rock bands in the coalor rock intrusions, or when rock must be cut in the roof or floor, thereis a marked increase in machine vibration and in tool wear and failure.Cutting rock also increases the quartz content of the generated dust.Research has shown that water-jet-assisted cutting, the process of usinga moderate pressure water jet to assist a mechanical cutting tool, canimprove cutting in the same harder rock types, reduce cutting tool wearand failure, reduce the percentage of product fines, and result in significantreductions in airborne respirable dust. To date, most water-jet-assistedcutting research has been done in the laboratory, often under conditionsnot representative of the underground mining environment. The U.S. Bureauof Mines, through a contact with Eichoff Corporation, has retrofitteda longwall shearer with water-jet-assisted cutting capabilities up to700 bar (10,000 psi) for testing in underground coal mines. This contractcalls for an in-mine evaluation of this machine in two mines, one inWest Germany and the second in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
