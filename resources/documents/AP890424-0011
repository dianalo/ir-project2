The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Associationsays it expects that only telecommunications equipment will buckthe trend. Global revenues of the information technology industryin 1988 totaled $604.7 billion, up 11.2 percent from the previousyear, the association says.   The figure includes computers and other electronic dataprocessing equipment, $304 billion; office equipment, $62.1billion; telecommunications equipment, $112.2 billion; as well assoftware and services, $126.4 billion.   In a global market analysis issued last week, CBEMA saidinformation industry revenues grew at an average annual rate of10.8 percent over the period 1980-88. But that growth rate, itsaid, is projected to decrease to 8.7 percent a year for the periodfrom 1988 through 1993.   Looking ahead for the next four years, ``there is a slowdown inall equipment markets except telecommunications,'' said HelgaSayadian, director of industry marketing statistics for theWashington-based association.   Ms. Sayadian said this trend ``reflects economic conditionsworldwide and the slight recession that is forecast near thebeginning of next year.''   For electronic data processing equipment, the worldwide annualgrowth rate averaged 12.3 percent in 1980-88 and is projected todrop to 8.9 percent in 1988-93.   Average annual growth for office equipment was 9.3 percent in1980-88 and is forecast to decline to 7.7 percent in 1988-93, whileyearly growth of software and services averaged 19 percent in1980-88 and is projected to drop to 11.9 percent in 1988-93.   By contrast, CBEMA said, annual growth for telecommunicationsequipment is forecast to increase slightly from 4.5 percent in1980-88 to 5.3 percent in 1988-93.   For 1988, consumption of information technology in North Americatotaled $299.4 billion; Europe, $212.4 billion; Asia, $76.7billion; South America, $8.8 billion, and the rest of the world,$7.4 billion.   Projections for 1993 are North America, $448.6 billion; Europe,$303.3 billion; Asia, $141.1 billion; South America, $16.2 billion,and the rest of the world, $12.1 billion, for a global total of$921.1 billion.   In terms of market share, the share of worldwide informationtechnology accounted for by electronic data processing equipmentwas 50.3 percent in 1988 and is forecast to edge up slightly to50.5 percent by 1993. Software and services are projected to risefrom 20.8 percent in 1988 to 24.1 percent in 1993.   However, the global market share for telecommunicationsequipment is expected to drop from 18.6 percent in 1988 to 15.7percent in 1993, while office equipment is projected to declinefrom 10.3 percent in 1988 to 9.7 percent in 1993.   The CBEMA study was prepared by the Center for Economic AnalysisInc., a consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., in cooperationwith the association's Industry Marketing Statistics Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
