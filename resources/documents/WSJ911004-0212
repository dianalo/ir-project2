For a peripatetic car-phone addict inEurope, this would mean switching cars at every border -- or,perhaps, stashing 15 phones in the trunk.   The convoluted situation in Europe, a deliberate outcomeof each country's policies, is a good example of howtelecommunications systems can develop with little regard forusers' needs. It is also typical of the hurdles facing theEuropean Community, where claims of a &quot;single market&quot; will bemeasured by how quickly standards emerge.   But muddled Europe now appears to be leading the chargeout of cellular confusion: The EC recently launched a newsystem called GSM, in which travelers will carry a plastic&quot;smart card&quot; that allows them to use advanced cellular phonesin more than 15 countries -- and have every call billed to asingle account without extra paper work. The phonesthemselves will work in any country that has signed on toGSM, a category EC officials hope will include nations fromEastern Europe to East Asia.   &quot;It looks like we might finally get rid of the patchworkquilt,&quot; says Don Burns, general manager of the Europeancellular subscriber division of Motorola Inc., which is oneof several companies planning to make GSM phones for the newmarket.   GSM uses digital technology, translating phone signalsinto a computer language of ones and zeros. That is a bigadvance from the simple radio-transmission method currentlyused by most cellular phones and allows more people to usethe system at any one time. It also makes possible newservices that may appeal to business people, such as sendingdifferent kinds of data and scrambling phone signals tothwart eavesdroppers.   The GSM concept has been in development since the early1980s and is still experiencing growing pains. Designed bymany EC committees, with input from Europeantelecommunications companies, the system has fallen behindschedule. This year's July 1 opening date, hailed by somecellular companies as the start of a new era, turned out tobe meaningless, because no GSM phones were available and veryfew areas of Europe had been hooked up to handle GSM calls.   Many of the EC's GSM-testing machines haven't even beencertified yet, meaning that prototype equipment can't begiven an official seal of approval. Without such approval --which ensures that equipment will work everywhere in Europe-- manufacturers are unlikely to begin producing largequantities of GSM telephones any time soon.   Still, GSM looks certain to be the first major digitalcellular-telephone system in the world, and several companiesare promising limited commercial service by the start of nextyear. At Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, the big Swedishtelecommunications concern, officials predict that GSM willtake off by late 1992 or early 1993, and start eclipsing theolder cellular system by 1994.   That would put Europe in the vanguard of next-generationcellular service, perhaps three years ahead of the U.S. andJapan. It also would create a uniform market with apopulation of more than 300 million, a tempting target forany major telecommunications company.   &quot;Quite frankly, I see a delay of only six months as quitean achievement,&quot; says Phil White, an analyst at PA ConsultingGroup, a U.K. market research firm. &quot;There are no fundamentalproblems here, just lots of little delays. I'm still veryoptimistic.&quot;   GSM stands for Global System for Mobile Communications, arather strained after-the-fact concoction. The lettersoriginally signified Groupe Special Mobile, the committeethat conceived the system in 1982. The decision to make the&quot;G&quot; stand instead for &quot;global,&quot; according to many industryexecutives, reflects the growing ambition of the system'splanners.   Curiously enough, the original motivation for apan-European cellular-phone system wasn't to allow users totravel more easily; it arose from the twin recognitions thatdigital systems were inevitable, and that country-by-countrystandards were hurting European telecommunications-equipmentsuppliers, who couldn't build the same economies of scale asAmerican and Japanese companies that supplied single,homogeneous home markets.   Much as Japan has used its vibrant domestic market as alaunching pad for multinational companies, the Europeansplanned to create a unified telecommunications market thatcould support the ambitions of big European technologycompanies such as France's Alcatel N.V., a unit of AlcatelAlsthom, and Germany's Siemens AG. The basic GSMspecifications, therefore, included much technology owned byEuropean companies -- proprietary technology that limited theaccess of competitors.   &quot;The fundamental advantage here is to the operators andmanufacturers,&quot; says Ian Reece of BIS Strategic Decisions, aU.K. research and consulting firm. &quot;They get standardequipment and economies of scale. I don't think you can putthe same value on the benefits to consumers. For a while, theconsumers will get no advantage at all -- they'll get moreexpensive, bulkier handsets, and less {geographical}coverage.&quot;   In fact, this point is conceded by many companies involvedin GSM. Mr. Burns of Motorola, for example, holds up hiscompany's smallest cellular phone, which works onconventional technology, and admits that &quot;we don't know,right now, how to fit GSM into this box.&quot; With much morecircuitry to be accommodated, he says, early GSM phonesprobably will resemble the brick-like cellular phones of themid-1980s.   One of Britain's two designated GSM operators, the Cellnetunit of British Telecommunications PLC, also agrees that muchremains to be done for consumers. Cellnet is building GSMtest sites at the moment and plans to offer coverage for mostof southeast England by the middle of next year. Service willthen extend up major motorways and into large cities, Cellnetsays, until about 90% of the U.K. is covered by the end of1993.   But even with such investments, &quot;we would expect markettake-up for the first couple of years will be prettyminimal,&quot; says Geoff Finch, Cellnet's director of businessdevelopment. &quot;If {the existing cellular network} issupporting the customer, why should he move off it? It may bethe late 1990s until we see that.&quot;   Mr. Finch says GSM is likely to take off faster incountries like Germany and France, which don't have strongexisting cellular networks, and in a few countries, such asBelgium, that are running out of capacity on their oldnetworks.   Competition is another factor: For many countries, GSMwill be the first telephone system that has two competingoperators. Germany, in particular, will be an interestingtest case, since the operator that isn't state-owned,Mannesmann AG, doesn't have either an existing cellularservice or a traditional telephone network to protect and isexpected to be very aggressive in its pricing.   &quot;GSM is the only thing they have,&quot; says Jan-AndersDalenstam, vice president for marketing at Ericsson RadioSystems, an Ericsson unit that is working with Mannesmann. &quot;Iwould expect Mannesmann to spearhead the entire market inEurope.&quot;   Mr. Dalenstam predicts that economies of scale in theGerman market alone will affect prices across Europe -- andmay also provide a shove for technology and coverage, makingGSM attractive to other European consumers sooner thanexpected.   The European Commission, which oversees GSM development inthe EC, is now trying to sell its digital standard to therest of the world. The U.S. and Japan definitely won't betakers, as they have started to develop their own digitalsystems. Japan, however, has offered to cooperate with the ECon a third-generation cellular standard that might emergenext century.   The commission is concentrating on Eastern Europe andfast-developing countries such as Thailand and Malaysia,where GSM's time edge over the U.S. and Japanese standards isimportant. Perhaps the biggest selling opportunity will comethis week, at the huge Telecom '91 exposition in Geneva.   &quot;It will be the first occasion world-wide for many peopleto see GSM equipment,&quot; says a commission official, who seesnon-European participation as a key to driving down costs.&quot;We will be trying very hard to give other countries anincentive to consider it as their new system.&quot;   Others, however, believe that the priority of GSM plannersshould be tending to crucial home markets such as Germany andFrance -- and then nailing down the agreements betweencellular operators that will make international roamingpossible. While only a small percentage of people may use theroaming facility regularly, most industry watchers believe itwill be a very good marketing tool for GSM, as long as itdoesn't cost too much extra. Ericsson's Mr. Dalenstam notesthat the only European countries that permit roaming acrosstraditional cellular networks -- the Nordic countries -- alsohave the world's highest rate of usage of cellular service.   Says Mr. White of PA Consulting: &quot;It's just common sensein Europe. If you're in Belgium, you get on the motorway, andbefore you know it, you're in Holland -- or France, orGermany. It's crazy not to have a cellular system that candeal with that.&quot;   ---   Mr. Hooper is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's London bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
