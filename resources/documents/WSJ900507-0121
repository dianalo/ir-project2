A railstrike, besides idling railroad workers and stranding riders,could cause more than 500,000 layoffs within two weeks inindustries served by railroads, the White House said.</LP><TEXT>   The railroads and unions are especially at odds overhealth-care costs, the stickiest issue in collectivebargaining in the past two years. The roads want to shiftmore of the cost burden to employees, which the unionsoppose.   Under the Rail Labor Act, an emergency board usually has30 days to make contract recommendations; afterward, therailroads may put their own contract terms into effect andthe unions are free to strike. But in this case both sideshave agreed to give the board until Sept. 15. They also saythey won't act until 30 days after the board reports or ifCongress isn't in session. Typically, when the parties haverejected an emergency board's recommendations, Congress hasaverted a long rail strike by putting the recommendationsinto effect by statute.</TEXT></DOC>
