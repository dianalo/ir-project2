The vessels were reported about 20 miles northeast of PointBarrow before first light in Barrow, about noon EDT, said CoastGuard spokesman Ken Freeze in Alameda, Calif. A helicopter was beingprepared to take representatives of the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration and the Coast guard to the ship, alongwith an interpreter, Freeze said.   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from Moscow, said thelarger of the two icrebreakers, the Admiral Makarov, had been slowedby heavy ice and by fog which rduced visibility to less than 200yards.   Meanwhile, ice experts were trying to find a way through thepressure ridge and rescuers were trying to coax the whales over ashoal between them and ridge. The whales retreated from the shoalMonday.   Anticipating the imminent arrival of two Soviet icebreakers, theice specialists were taking soundings Monday of the water depth oneither side of the ridge, a jumbled mass of ice chunks about 200yards wide and some 30 feet high.   The skipper of a U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker assigned to act asliaison with the Soviets and a National Weather Service analyst wereamong those looking for a place where the icebreaker could punchthrough the ridge.   The California gray whales must get through the icy tangle ifthey are to reach an open lead, or pathway, through the ice.   The whales, stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two weeksago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of Barrow, were aboutfour miles from the ice ridge. A third whale disappeared Friday andis presumed dead.   ``It's discouraging,'' federal biologist David Withrow saidMonday as the mammals, apparently spooked by a shoal that hasstymied progress for three days, retreated about 800 yards. ``Whycome back here when they know it's open up there?''   The California gray whales struggled up for air, tiring quicklyas they poked their way through large slabs of Beaufort Sea ice andthick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom.   At one point, the 27-foot-long whale _ the smaller of the two _rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice. Blood oozedfrom a raw spot on its snout, smearing the ice and staining thewater.   Biologists called a temporary halt to opening new breathing holesso the whales would have a chance to rest and perhaps seek the openwater on their own.   Rescue coordinator Ron Morris of the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration remained optimistic.   ``They always regress some before they learn,'' Morris said ofthe whales. ``They'll move.''   Meanwhile, specialists determined through soundings that there isabout 40 feet of water beneath the pressure ridge, a jumbled mass ofice chunks about 30 feet high and as wide as two football fields.   ``There is a lot of water flowing beneath the ridge, which shouldmean it will be easier (for the Soviet icebreakers) to breakthrough'' than had been expected, Morris said.   The icebreakers Admiral Makarov and Vladimir Arseniev wereexpected to arrive this morning. The Soviet help was requested bythe U.S. government and the environmental group Greenpeace.   The whales must make their way through the ridge if they are toreach a lead, or pathway, through the ice. The nearest open water is200 miles away in the Chukchi Sea.   Breaching the ridge won't do any good if the whales can't becoaxed past the shoal. The animals, stranded about 100 yardsoffshore more than two weeks ago by shifting ice 13 miles northeastof Barrow, were four miles from the ridge. A third whale, whichdisappeared Friday, is presumed dead.   A shift in tactics Monday proved disappointing.   Eskimos connected a series of breathing holes to form a singleopen channel about 600 yards long. Instead of pushing the broken iceback under the ice sheet, they used long poles to guide it towardthe rear of the slot.   The idea was to keep the whales from heading back. Initially, itworked. The whales swam back and forth between the shoal's edge andthe rear of the channel.   But when the channel behind them was nearly filled, the whalesturned back.   About 12 feet of water lies over the 125-yard-wide shoal, saidbiologist Geoff Carroll. The whales have been spending most of thetime in water 17 to 25 feet deep.   ``As it gets shallower, it feels (to the whales) like they'rebeaching themselves,'' said Jim Harvey, a biologist from theNational Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.   Officials hope at least one of the Soviet icebreakers can breachthe ridge, said Rear Adm. Sigmund R. Petersen, director of NOAA'sMarine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.   Charts indicate the water at the ridge is about 30 feet deep, andthe 443-foot-long Admiral Makarov needs about 35 feet to operate,Petersen said. The smaller Vladimir Arseniev needs about 22 feet.   ``It does seem that the Makorov would have more trouble doingthis,'' he said. ``But they may be able to assist each other. I'msure that these vessels, which have operated in the Arctic foryears, have all kinds of solutions to these things.''   Biologists have a last-ditch option: airlifting the whales toopen water. Withrow emphasized that would be a last resort becausethe whales could be injured or traumatized.   Although rescuers said they were committed to freeing the whales,the cost of the effort continues to mount.   Most of those involved in the attempt seem reluctant to talkabout the tab but it appears substantial _ at least $600,000 by lateMonday.</TEXT></DOC>
