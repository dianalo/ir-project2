Thermalaging of polyurethane foam for insulating heating pipes, extrusion-filmpipeline-insulation materials and processes, flexible expanded nitrile-rubberpipeline insulation with class 1 fire rating, and underground fiberglass-reinforcedpolyester insulated-pipeline systems are among the topics discussed.Applications in solar-heating systems, underground water, oil, and gas,interior hot water and cold water lines under seawater, and chemical-plantpipeline-system insulation are included. (This updated bibliography contains139 citations, all of which are new entries to the previous edition.)</TEXT></DOC>
