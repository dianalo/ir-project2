Since the adoptionof International Maritime Organization's rules concerning dangerous orhazardous cargoes in June, 1985, considerable information has been gatheredconcerning the specifics necessary to the proper reporting of these cargoesand the need to be consistent throughout the regulations. The proposedamendments are mainly procedural. The intent is to clarify informationfor Canal users.Further, it is proposed to revise the requirement for vessels carryingnuclear materials to provide proof of financial responsibility to establishthat such vessels msut have adequate provision for indemnity and loss comparablein general scope to the protection afforded under the United States AtomicEnergy Act or consistent with international practice and standards. Vesselswill also be required to furnish the Commission with the results of radiationsurvey reports prior to transiting.Additionally, the Commission's Marine Bureau has been reorganized. Thetitles of heads of certain units have changed and are published for thebenefit of our customers. For example, the inspection of floating equipmentis now under the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard Liaison Officer, whois also the Special Assistant to the Marine Director for Marine Safety.He heads a Marine Safety Unit consisting of four members, two of whom arefloating equipment inspectors. The main purpose served by the proposedchanges to Part 121, ``Inspection and Registration of Vessels'', is toproperly reflect the present area of responsibility and to include referencespertinent to U.S. Coast Guard Marine Inspection Regulations contained in46 CFR.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submittingwritten comments. Those desiring acknowledgement that their comments havebeen received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed post care or envelope.The Commission will evaluate all communications received and determinea course of final action on this proposal. The proposed regulations maybe changed in light of the comments received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment and Certification</ITAG>The Panama Canal Commission has determined that these proposed changesdo not constitute major rules within the meaning of Executive Order 12291dated February 17, 1981 (47 CFR 13193), inasmuch as these changes, whenimplemented, would not have an effect on the economy of $100 million ormore per year. These proposed changes would not result in a major increasein cost or prices for consumers, individual industries, local governmentagencies or geographic regions.Further, the agency has determined that implementation of the rules willhave no adverse impact on competition, employment, investment, productivityinnovation or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Finally,the Commission has determined that these rules are not subject to the requirementsof sections 603 and 604 of Title 5, United States Code, in that their promulgationwill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The drafters of this notice are Captain William Y.
