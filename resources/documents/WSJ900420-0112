Milken a deadlineof noon today to accept a plea bargain or face additionalcharges, according to people familiar with the pleanegotiations.   Lawyers for the former chief of Drexel Burnham LambertInc.'s junk-bond operations have spent nearly four monthstrying to negotiate an agreement that would enable Mr. Milkento avoid the new charges and the prospect of a lengthy trial.Mr. Milken already faces charges on 98 counts related toinsider trading and other alleged securities-law violations.</LP><TEXT>   The government is buttressing its deadline by ordering thefederal grand jury that has been investigating Mr. Milken toconvene in Manhattan today, individuals familiar with theinvestigation said. If Mr. Milken decides not to accept theplea agreement, the grand jury could vote on an expandedindictment this afternoon.   Any plea agreement would involve a settlement of civilinsider-trading charges brought by the Securities andExchange Commission in September 1988, as well as thecriminal charges -- including racketeering, conspiracy andsecurities fraud -- handed up by a federal grand jury inMarch 1989.   Under the settlement terms offered by the government, Mr.Milken would have to plead guilty to six felony counts andpay more than $650 million in fines and penalties, accordingto individuals familiar with the plea discussions. While afederal judge would decide on the length of Mr. Milken'sprison term, prosecutors would recommend a sentence totalingfive years for all the counts, the individuals said. Aspokesman for Mr. Milken declined to comment.   Lawyers familiar with the case say Mr. Milken would beunlikely to receive as attractive a settlement offer once anew indictment was issued and the government began to preparefor trial. If convicted of racketeering charges at trial, Mr.Milken could face up to 20 years in prison.   While an acceptable plea agreement seemed highly unlikelyas recently as last week, Mr. Milken's legal team, led byArthur Liman, a partner at the New York firm of Paul, Weiss,Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, has been negotiating nearlyaround the clock since last weekend with officials of theSEC.   Among the major sticking points from the standpoint of theMilken camp was the SEC's insistence that Mr. Milkencooperate in the government's continuing insider-tradinginvestigations, individuals familiar with the negotiationssay. The government is understood to have softened the termsof its cooperation requirement.   Individuals who spoke with Mr. Milken as recently as lateyesterday said that while some of his attorneys and othersrecommended that he accept the negotiated pact, Mr. Milkenhad still not made up his mind about whether to do so. Theysaid Mr. Milken was less concerned about the fines and jailterm than he was about having to cooperate with any furtherinvestigation. In addition, he was said to be worried aboutthe status of the case against his brother, Lowell Milken,who was also charged in last year's indictment.   Although Michael Milken has directed his lawyers to workout terms of an agreement, individuals who know him well saythey wouldn't be surprised if he rejected the pact at thelast minute. Before last year's indictment, Mr. Milken'sattorneys held a round of negotiations with the government.But after prosecutors relented on certain positions Mr.Milken considered key to a settlement, Mr. Milken rejectedthe offer in the end, the individuals said.   The latest government deadline was set by Roger Hayes, thedeputy U.S. attorney in Manhattan who is supervising thecase. Prosecutors last month had told U.S. District JudgeKimba Wood that a new indictment would be handed up no laterthan this week.</TEXT></DOC>
