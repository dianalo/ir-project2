(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>RELIEF AHOY!andM;The life of a database administrator (DBA) is hard no matter what databasemanagement system he directs, and the life of the Oracle DBA is no exception.andO;It sometimes seems to be a futile quest for the DBA to manage a relationaldatabase management system, because these products are often cryptic abouttheir inner workings and unfriendly in the tools they provide for dealingwith security, space utilization and structuring business applications.andP;  Tomake the best of managing an RDBMS, a DBA can use all the help he can get.andO;For users of Oracle, that help is available.andM;DBA Companion from SQL Solutions is a powerful suite of productivity toolsfor managing an installed Oracle RDBMS.andP;  A menu-driven, multilevel packagewith a uniform interface across modules, DBA Companion helps databaseadministrators grant privileges to users, improves security and gives DBAsmore ways to maximize the efficiency of their Oracle systems and delegatepart of their duties to others without abandoning their authority orcompromising system security.andP;  DBA Companion is also invaluable toapplication developers because it can scan source code and maintain a list ofcross-references.andM;Three major components make up DBA Companion's set of tools.andP;  The ApplicationManagement Facility grants end users access to applications and resourcesunder an application schema that structures these entities according to howthey are used.andP;  The Security Management Facility allows managers to createand monitor the security requirements of an application and its resources, inparticular making it easier to grant and revoke access privileges.andP;  TheSystem Management Facility provides data on Oracle's use of CPU time and diskspace, providing reports to allow optimal management of these parameters.andO;Although a DBA often will have prime responsibility for applications,security and system management, each of DBA Companion's three facilities canbe used by different administrators who are not necessarily in charge of anentire system.andM;DBA Companion uses a succession of hierarchically structured Oracle SQL*Formsscreens for data entry and retrieval; its keypad corresponds to that ofSQL*Forms, Oracle's forms package.andP;  Operations on these screens reflect thecustomary ways Oracle users interact with SQL*Forms screens.andM;All three modules of DBA Companion are based on a concept of &quot;applications&quot;that permits users to impose a structure on their database that betterreflects the way they organize their business or research.andP;  The modules allowthe DBA to partition security management responsibilities along customaryorganizational lines.andP;  Applications can include such areas as inventory,accounting, personnel and research.andP;  Each application's database may havevarying access requirements.andM;KNOW THY RESOURCESandM;Resources, which are the components that make up each application, areexecutable data processing elements that interact with the database, such asOracle SQL*Forms data entry screens and 3GL programs with embedded SQL.andP;  TheDBA sets up user classes to link a group of users to a particular group ofrelated resources.andP;  All members of a particular user class are able to invokeall resources assigned to that user class.andP;  The user-class concept imposes anorganizational structure on the resources and users of a particularapplication.andM;All three DBA Companion facilities are set up on the same multilevel menupattern.andP;  The menu system itself is a stand-alone executable that a useraccesses at the DCL level by typing MENU after the system prompt.andM;A user who has a default Oracle identification is placed directly into DBACompanion's introductory menu.andP;  A user who lacks a default Oracle ID isprompted for an Oracle user name and password.andP;  Once these are supplied, theprogram queries the database and displays only those applications that theuser is authorized to access.andM;DOWN INTO MEMORYandM;Once the user sees an initial application menu listing all accessibleapplications, he selects one by pressing the Next record key (whichcorresponds to the down-arrow key on a VT220 terminal) and the Commit key(the Do key).andP;  This displays the Resource menu, which shows all the resourcesthe user is authorized to access.andM;Resources are components that make up each application.andP;  They are executabledata processing elements that interact with the database, such as OracleSQL*Forms data entry screens and 3GL programs with embedded SQL.andP;  The DBA canbuild sumenus, which are resource menus deeper than this second level, forgeneral use.andP;  Submenus can be created on as many levels as memory willpermit.andM;DBA Companion's Application Management Facility (AMF) aids applicationdevelopers as well as DBAs.andP;  The AMF database, which is maintained on anentity relationship model, lists each entity by name, type, description, ordate of creation or modification, with options for extended documentation andrelationships.andM;The AMF provides two sets of tools for automatic information gathering.andP;  Thefirst group scans application source files (for example, SQL, Cobol, Fortranor C programs) for infomation on what tables they use.andP;  The second set tracksdata on the entities of a database system (applications, resources, sourcecode usage); Oracle database components such as space definitions, tables,users and synonyms, and interactions between entities.andM;In testing DBA Companion, we used AMF-created applications with associatedSQL*Forms input and query forms to access DR Labs' three-table Circ database.andM;There were three files per table, .FRM .INP and .SQL, that we wanted to asingto applications.andP;  The .FRM file is used by Oracle to generate the SQL *Formsscreen for initial data entry, the .INP file contains input to the screen,and the SQL file is the SQL script that created the original table.andP;  Toassign these files, we first moved them to the DBA Companion test directory,then made them known to DBA Comparison by running the AMF Scanner againstthem to determine usage of SQL and resource entity relationship(interdendencies between modules).andM;To set up an application, we ran the AMF proper.andP;  Using the CreateApplication Entity screen (Fig.andP;  1), we set up an application called ALLINFOto allow suers to access all three tables, along with three otherapplications to give users access to each table separately.andP;  We next used theAssign Application Entities screen to select from all available entities.andM;The Assign Application Entities screen, like many DBA Companion screens,displays two side-by-side block at the bottom and one or two horizontallydemarcated graphics blocks at the top of the screen.andP;  These blocks containthe same type of entities, which in our case are forms, SQL statements andtableS, but with different status within the system: Either they are assignedto an application or they are not.andM;To select records for an application, moving them from one graphical block onthe screen to another and changing their status, we invoked the TransferProcess (Fig.andP;  2).andM;We selected entities by moving the cursor to the desired item, then pressingthe Delete Record key (the Remove key).andP;  An asterisk appeared in theindicator field to show that the record had been selected for transfer.andO;After going through this process to flag all six records we wnated for theapplication, we transferred the entire group of records to the adjacentgraphical block by pressing the Commit key.andP;  We then repeated the process todefine our other three applications.andM;Using information gathered from the working of the AMF, eight AMF reportsshow developers the current status of entities, entity relationships, anddiscrepancies between usage and rules.andP;  For example, there are reports thatlist unused entities or invalid entity relationships.andM;DBA Companion's Security Management Facility helps a DBA get around nativeOracle's piecemeal approach to granting user privileges, freeing up time andclosing security loopholes along the way, as well as providing an audittrail.andP;  DBA Companion's run-time menu system assures that any end user'saccess will be restricted to applications presented on the menu the DBA setsup for him.andM;Membership in a user class not only organizers access to resources but alsoaids the DBA in setting up system security.andP;  Within a given user class, thesystem automatically grants all privileges necessary to perform databaseoperations on specified resources.andP;  Should the DBA decide to change thedatabase access requirements of a user class, the appropriate privileges areautomatically modified and assigned.andM;We used the Security Management Facility's Assign Table Usage screen toassign tables to the application ALLINFO, specifying which users had accessto which tables.andP;  Using the Transfer Process described earlier, we selectedthe three tables from DR Labs' Circ database, called Users, Sys and Mach(Fig.andP;  3).andP;  The three tables contain a subject of an Old database of DRsubcribers and hold demographic, operating system and hardware informationrelated to subcribers and their sites.andM;Fourteen security reports,which are availble as either on-screen displays orprintouts, are provided, as well as 10 audit trail reports.andP;  Each audit trailreport includes two or three options to track all changes, changes byindividual user, and/or changes by application.andP;  The reports aid great inpinpointing changes to the system.andM;The Security Management Facility simplifies user authorization and thegranting of access to Oracle resources.andP;  In native Oracle, each GRANT orREVOKE statement must be made separately by writing individual Oracle DataControl Language commands directly within an SQL*Plus environment or embeddedin a high-level language program.andP;  Any installed site will soon have togenerate large and cumbersome text files with an editor to grant each useraccess in a piecemeal fashion.andM;Not only does DBA Companions automate this process, but it also keepssystematic track of users and priveleges in its own database, which issomething Oracle itself does not do, however desirable this is to systemefficiency and security.andM;Without DBA Companion, for example, an application user who has SQL*Formsaccess to a table that restricts him from deleting data might be able toenter SQL*Plus to gain full access to the table and delete it entirely!andP;  ThisOracle loophole can allow a male volent data entry clerk to wreak havoc on adatabase.andM;DBA Companion's Security Management Facility closes off this loophole byallowing the security manager to limit a user's access to operations on datawithin the particular table, and prevent the user from deleting the tableitself.andM;It is critical that the DBA keep on top of a database's space usage, becauseexcessive fragmentation and the filling of free space can severely compromiseperformance.andP;  Oracle itself provides little help to the DBA in this area.andM;To manage the system, the DBA Companion System Management Facility providestools for determining space-usage trends and maximizing efficiency.andP;  It canlocate potential sources of performance and space problems before they occur,and use Oracle's export and import utilities to reorganize database data toforestall problems.andM;The DBA can analyze database trends through the use of archival datacollected by regularly running the SYSPROC procedure, invoked from the DCLlevel or from DBA Companion's menu system.andP;  The SYSPROC procedure recordsinformation it collects on the growth of partitions (the major division ofspace in an Oracle database) and tables, enabling the DBA to take timelyaction to head off trouble.andM;The System Management Facility provides a set of six informative reports.andO;For example, the Database and Partition Summary, lists partitions, specifyingthe number of free and used blocks, the number of fragments, and the size ofthe biggest, smallest and average pieces.andM;Alone, this summary is a good snapshot of fragmentation.andP;  When compared withreports from previous dates, it can be used to determine the rate of increaseof space usage and fragmentation, prompting appropriate action by the DBA.andM;The Table Roster, the most detailed of the System Management Facility'sreports, documents the space consumption of a user's tables, listing data andindex extents, the number of free and used blocks, and the number of chainedblocks (overlong table rows written to blocks not contiguous with the table'soriginal data block).andP;  For the DBA, this report is a good monitor of spaceusage and chaining that can degrade performance.andP;  For applicationsprogrammers, it functions as a quick reference to table characteristics.andM;AID AND COMFORTandM;Technical support, including telephone support, is provided by developersinvolved in ongoing work with the product.andP;  When we called to resolve minorincondistencies between screen messages and the printed documentation, ourquestions were dealt with promptly and knowledgeably.andM;Training is available as SQL Solutions' main office in Burlington, Mass.andO;Help in installing and configuring the package also is available.andP;  SQLSolutions will contract for further consultation with clients, either attheir site or in Burlington, on an individual basis.andM;Prices for the basic DBA Comparison license range from $1,1350 for two userson a MicVAX, II to $45,650 for a VAX 6000-360 and an unlimited number ofusers on a VAX 8840.andP;  (See &quot;Prices,&quot; left.)andP;  For any Oracle site, large orsmall, DBA Companion is an extremely valuable add-on at a moderate cost.andO;Upcoming major enhancements should make the package even more powerful.andP;  (See&quot;Goodies to come,&quot; page 30.)andM;Structured to pick up where Oracle's native capabilities leave off, DBACompanion offers strong tools for security management and maximizingefficiency.andP;  Although it's a boon to administrative control and productivity,DBA Companion cannot be used to optimize the performance of an Oracledatabase.andP;  Any performance deficiencies in query processing are built intothe architecture of Oracle itself.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
