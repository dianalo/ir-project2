Mr. Scannell, 54 years old, talks freely about trying new initiatives if the Senate confirms his nomination by President Bush to head the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He suggests his efforts could include promulgating the agency's first standard to protect on-the-job motor-vehicle drivers, boosting the size of criminal fines for the most egregious employer workplace violations, and substantially expanding efforts to reduce carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves arm, wrist and hand injuries resulting from repetitive motions.    He also promises to speed up OSHA's rule-making process. &quot;I will be very tough on meeting deadlines,&quot; Mr. Scannell said in an interview. &quot;If we're going to do something, we'll do it.&quot;    It's unusual for a nominee to speak so freely about his agenda before the Senate acts on his confirmation. Mr. Scannell emphasizes that carrying out his ideas obviously hinges on his being cleared by the Senate; lawmakers haven't yet scheduled action on the nomination. But the prospective new OSHA chief leaves no doubt that he'd be an activist. He exudes quiet confidence with a deceptively friendly -- but nonetheless tough-minded -- style.    Though OSHA has become more vigorous in recent years than it was during the early, deregulation-minded years of the Reagan administration, Mr. Scannell says, &quot;I believe there's a lot to do to improve administration of the {Occupational Safety and Health} act.&quot;    Mr. Scannell knows something of what he speaks. As safety and environmental affairs director for 10 years at Johnson andamp; Johnson, the big New Brunswick, N.J., health-care products company, he helped the firm acquire a top reputation in worker health and safety matters. He also held workplace-safety jobs for Aetna Casualty andamp; Surety Co., Thiokol Chemical Corp. and Rohm andamp; Haas Co. between 1958 and 1971.    And through most of the 1970s, he was an OSHA official; as standards director of the young agency, which was formed in 1971, he wrote the regulations that comprise the core of its standards today. Mr. Scannell says that in studying OSHA today, he found the agency is &quot;still working on things they were working on when I was here before.&quot;    In a typically no-nonsense set of written responses to questions posed to him recently by the National Safe Workplace Institute, a private Chicago group, Mr. Scannell said of his stint as OSHA's rules writer: &quot;I believe my track record as director of standards is second to none.&quot; He said he couldn't identify &quot;notable failures,&quot; though he considered lack of much progress on a migrant labor-camp regulation as a &quot;disappointment.&quot;    Mr. Scannell evidently has convinced Joseph Kinney, the institute's director, of his dedication to worker health and safety. Mr. Kinney founded the group after his younger brother was killed in a construction accident. He worried initially that the nominee would be &quot;just a smoother version&quot; of his predecessor, John Pendergrass, whom Mr. Kinney regarded as not tough enough. But since Mr. Scannell has been willing to confer with Mr. Kinney, and because of the nominee's comments about what OSHA needs to do, Mr. Kinney now talks hopefully that Mr. Scannell will make OSHA a hard-hitting agency.    Not everyone applauds Mr. Scannell, though. Conservative, deregulation-oriented economists are likely to take a dim view of his activist ideas, and some are already frowning on the selection of a career industrial hygienist for the OSHA job.    Margaret Seminario, an AFL-CIO health and safety official, offers only guarded praise, reflecting unions' wariness about any nominee from management ranks. &quot;He seems to be a serious individual who wants to run a serious safety and health program,&quot; she says.    Although Mr. Scannell isn't yet in a position to make OSHA decisions, OSHA and Labor Department people benefit from his expertise and counsel as they brief him on issues and forge ahead on their own in regulatory actions.    Any direct Scannell role in OSHA policy-making would be &quot;inappropriate,&quot; says OSHA spokesman Roy Clason. But Alan McMillan, a veteran department regulator who was named OSHA's deputy chief and its acting head at Mr. Scannell's urging, already has pursued stronger rule-making and enforcement. Backing Mr. McMillan is Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who helped pry loose some regulations that had languished a dozen years or more at OSHA, including one to protect persons who work in confined spaces such as storage vessels and railroad tank cars.    OSHA is also seeking funds from Congress for another 179 inspectors. That would be the first increase in the inspector force in a decade. It was cut 25%, to 1,200, under President Reagan.    Under Mr. Scannell, OSHA seems certain to show still more vigor. He wants to include unions in the rule-making and enforcement process and complete work on standards faster. &quot;Let's get out things that have been hanging around, festering -- and are needed,&quot; Mr. Scannell says.    He also says, flatly, &quot;A motor vehicle safety standard is needed.&quot; Building on his heavy emphasis at Johnson andamp; Johnson on safe cars and driver safety, he says he'd like to issue general requirements that employers would have to follow. It could spur increased driver-safety training and employer policies mandating safety belt use, for example. Mr. Pendergrass rebuffed suggestions for such rules, insisting OSHA lacks authority to issue them. </TEXT></DOC>
