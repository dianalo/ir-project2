Smith retires today after leading General MotorsCorp. for nearly a decade -- certainly the period of greatestchange in the company's modern history.   Mr. Smith completely reorganized GM in 1984, shelled outbillions of dollars to modernize factories and spent billionsmore on high-tech and defense acquisitions. He started ajoint venture to build cars with Toyota Motor Corp. andcreated Saturn Corp., a separate subsidiary, to develop newways of making and selling cars. To his backers, all thisindicates Mr. Smith's vision, and it has made him the mostvisible GM chairman since the legendary Alfred P. Sloan Jr.,who ran the company between 1937 and 1956.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Smith, who became chairman on Jan. 1, 1981, hasalso been GM's most controversial chairman ever. He clashedwith dissident director H. Ross Perot and became the subjectof three critical books and a scathing movie.   Mr. Smith's detractors say his vision was no substitutefor focusing on the basics of the car business: buildingexciting, high-quality vehicles and making customers happy.GM lost nearly 10 points of U.S. market share during Mr.Smith's tenure, mainly because of look-alike cars and poorquality in the mid-1980s. The share loss saddled GM with somuch extra plant capacity that its huge North American autobusiness barely breaks even.   Mr. Smith spent 41 years at GM. His official duties tookhim around the world. But he never found the time, he says,to visit the Tower of London or stroll through the Louvre.Mr. Smith recently discussed his record with Paul Ingrassiaand Joseph B. White of the Journal's Detroit staff. Here areexcerpts from the interview:                                                                                                          Q: If you gave yourself a letter grade for yourperformance as chairman, what would it be?   A: I don't know that there's any single grade. We wentfrom a $763 million loss {in 1980} to making more money thananyone in the world except Royal Dutch Shell. That probablyisn't too bad. A lot of the grades have to be incomplete.What kind of grade do you give Saturn? On mergers andacquisitions, you've almost got to have an A-plus there, whenyou look at $2.5 billion for EDS {Electronic Data SystemsCorp.} that's now worth $10 billion. Preparedness for the21st century should get a pretty good grade. . . . Overseas{performance} should get a good grade.   Market share, obviously, we're not happy with that. I hada guy {who} wrote me a letter the other day. He said, &quot;If youask Jack Nicklaus the best round of golf he ever had on theeasiest golf course, and he told you it was 60, but yesterdayhe shot an 82 on St. Andrews, would you say he lost 22strokes off his game?&quot; The market share we had in the late'70s and 1980s was on a course that was a lot easier to shootthan the one we're on today.                                                                                                          Q: What's your proudest accomplishment?   A: Getting the corporation ready for the 21st century iswhat I feel the best about. I'm convinced the automobileindustry has yet to catch up with Hughes technology. {GMbought Hughes Aircraft Co. for about $5 billion in 1985.} Andwhen the auto industry catches up, you'll see us kick in theafterburners.                                                                                                          Q: What's your biggest disappointment?   A: The thing we didn't do right was the communication onthe restructuring. {The move in 1984 eliminated two huge GMoperations -- Fisher Body and the Assembly Division -- andreorganized GM's car divisions under two umbrella groups.} Wegot a little misled, overconfident, that this thing was goingto go down better than it did.                                                                                                          Q: What, in hindsight, could you have done to avoid thedrop in market share? Why didn't GM act sooner to fix thelook-alike car problem and the quality problems that hurtmarket share?   A: To get the look-alike thing {fixed}, you can't comewith paper and paste. You have to come with new models. Wedid get locked into basic body designs. If you and I, withall the resources in the world, said, &quot;Hey, we want a newbody so they don't look alike and have higher quality,&quot; ittakes three to five years. And in those days it took evenlonger. We had to re-equip our plants. We took the long-termapproach not to go in there with Band-Aids.                                                                                                          Q: Did you suspect from the start that the relationshipwith Mr. Perot wouldn't work out? {GM bought EDS in 1984. Mr.Perot left the company he founded and GM's board in 1986 aspart of a $700 million buy-out.}   A: The board discussed that. One director said in his owncompany, with something like 20 acquisitions, he'd only savedone CEO. We thought we could do it. A lot of people did a lotof surface reporting {on the Perot controversy}. That stockwas $33; now it's $140 {adjusted for splits}. That's not toobad.                                                                                                          Q: Early in your tenure, the company focused ontechnology. Recently, there's been more emphasis on people.Does that reflect an evolution in your own thinking?   A: People said you guys made a horrible mistake, youovershot on technology. That's not a mistake, that's adeliberate thing. If you keep pulling string out of the boxand stop, you never know how much string is in the box,right? We've taken technology out of some places that we putit in. But I would tell you if we hadn't put it in, we'dnever know we should take it out.                                                                                                          Q: What's the strategic importance of Saturn?   A: We wanted to find out if we could build a car of thatsize and that quality in this country at a competitive costand sell it at a profit. No U.S. manufacturing company hasdone that yet. Using our regular designs, our regularproduction techniques, you can't do that. So we said: &quot;Have ago at it on a clean sheet.&quot; You've got to see Saturn whenit's running. That plant is so different from our normalplants.                                                                                                          Q: You've been the subject of books, of a movie, and a lotof critical news coverage. How did that affect youpersonally, and how did you deal with it?   A: Fair criticism I never minded. It's difficult when youread in a book that you foam at the mouth and throw paper onthe floor. The only time I foam at the mouth is when I brushmy teeth. I've never thrown a paper on the floor in my life.                                                                                                          Q: Do you put the criticism out of your mind?   A: You like to say that you do that. I don't know thatthat's true. {What} almost bothers me as much is what I callsurface reporting. If someone had looked just one more littlebit into GM's actions to try and understand the long-rangeconsequences of what we were doing, then people would havegotten a better story.                                                                                                          Q: Why did you decide to make higher pensions retroactiveto executives like yourself, who are retiring now, if thestated goal was to attract and retain management talent?   A: They weren't retroactive. It was over a year ago, lastJune or July, that the incentive compensation committee {ofGM's board}, who'd been tracking compensation programs, toldmanagement our pensions were pretty bad. By October 1989, theboard acted to make the change {subject to shareholderapproval}. They made it effective the end of that month.Seventy-nine percent of companies had better pensions than wedid. Even today, 61% of companies have better pensions.                                                                                                          Q: How do you think you'll be regarded by history?   A: I'm more concerned about what I've been able to do forthe corporation and the stockholders. I was never out to makemy mark in history. I wanted to do it for the company.                                                                                                          Q: What does U.S. industry overall, not just the autoindustry, need to do to become more competitive?   A: Manufacturing technology is really undergoingtremendous change. . . . The whole approach to design formanufacturability is undergoing a big revolution. . . .You've got to take out levels of management. You've got toget decision-making pushed down in the organization to wherethe action is.   Q: The Japanese got 28% of the car market during the firsthalf of the year, which was a record. Is it going to gohigher?   A: One thing that's happening is U.S. quality is comingup. I'm certainly never going to tell you we're going todrive the Japanese from the shores. Customers get more fromthe competition, and in being competitive everybody has to dobetter. I like it.                                                                                                          Q: Japanese companies have built eight plants here. Whydon't you go over and build one in Japan?   A: You can't do that. We have a piece of Isuzu and a pieceof Suzuki. But that really is a closed market over there. . .. When they came out of World War II, they closed that marketup tighter than a drum. It's only in recent days that you seeany opening.                                                                                                          Q: You think the Japanese don't play fair?   A: They've got an enviable position. They're able to getalong in world trade without giving people access to theirhome markets.                                                                                                          Q: Their answer is that BMW is doing fine in Japan. {BMWis the leading import luxury make and sold 33,076 cars in1989, giving it a market share of 0.8%.}   A: What's doing fine? In a market of that size, I call 38%doing fine, or 28%.                                                                                                          Q: What are your retirement plans?   A: I don't believe I'm the type of person who can slam onthe brakes and run for the rocking chair. I want to do a lotof things I owe my wife and family, and then I want to dosome real estate development. I want to do something, beactive, then complete it and then not have to start anotherone for two to three months if I don't want to.                                                                                                          Q: What will you do for play?   A: Hunting, fishing, traveling. You'd be surprised, withall the places I've been, how few things I've really seenthat people go to see. {There are} lots of things in thiscountry I haven't seen. Lots of great rivers I haven'tfished. . . . I wish I were 20 years younger, in somerespects. There are so many terrific things happening. {But}it wouldn't be to spend 20 more years as chairman, I'll tellyou that. If I were 20 years younger, I'd want to start downthe ladder.</TEXT></DOC>
