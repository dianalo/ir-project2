Except for this exemption, child-resistant packagingwould be required.

Background</ITAG>Among other substances, aspirin is subject to child-resistant packagingrequirements issued under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (``thePPPA''), 15 U.S.C. 1471-1476. 16 CFR 1700.14(a)(10). Unflavored aspirin-containingdrugs in powder form (other than those intended for pediatric use) areexempt from this requirement when packaged in unit doses containing notmore than 13 grains of aspirin per unit dose. 16 CFR 1700.14(a)(1)(ii).This exemption was issued by the Commission in 1978 based on the low incidenceof accidental ingestions of powdered aspirin by young children and on studieswhich indicate that young children are not likely to consume a toxic amountof the product. 43 FR 17330 (April 21, 1978). The Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has previously exempted powders containing 10 grains or less of aspirinin 1972 (37 FR 2864), based on the same findings.By letter dated May 20, 1987, Block Drug Company, Inc., petitioned theCommission to amend the exemption for powdered aspirin to increase thepermissible amount of aspirin per unit dose of the powdered product from13 grains to 15.4 grains (15.4 grains = 1 gram). As justification for theexemption, the petitioner provided test data showing that the requestedincrease in aspirin content is not significant toxicologically and, therefore,does not present an increased risk to young children. The petitioner providedhuman experience data showing that young children are unlikely to ingesta sufficient quantity of aspirin powders to cause serious adverse effects.The petitioner also noted that its particular product is an adult-orientedproduct and is usually purchased for immediate consumption at the placeof purchase, rather than for household storage and possible access by children.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Toxicity Data</ITAG>While the mean lethal dose of aspirin is 20-30 grams in adults, toxic effectsmay occur when 10 or more grams are ingested over a period of 12-24 hours.Toxic symptoms include emesis, tinnitis (ringing in the ear), headache,hyperpnea (abnormally deep and rapid breathing), confusion or mania, andgeneral convulsions. Death is usually due to respiratory failure or cardiovascularcollapse.The petitioner conducted acute oral toxicity tests in rats, which showedthat the requested increase in aspirin content does not measurably increasethe toxicity of the powder. The Commission's Directorate for Health Sciencesconcludes that the increase in aspirin content will not increase the likelihoodof ingestion of a toxic dose. This is because the increase in aspirin isnot toxicologically significant, the physical nature of the preparationstill makes handling difficult, and the bitter taste will continue to deterchildren.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Injury Data</ITAG>Human experience data show few cases of accidental ingestion of powderedaspirin drugs by young children and no serious symptoms associated withthose ingestions. Data from the Food and Drug Administration's NationalClearinghouse for Poison Control Centers for 1978 to 1984 show 20 reportedingestions of aspirin-containing analgesic powders by children under agefive. There were no reported symptoms or hospital visits.The Commission's Children and Poisoning (CAP) data base, for the period1978 to September 1987, shows only one powdered aspirin ingestion by achild under age five treated in a hospital emergency room. The child wastreated and released.Neither the petitioner's adverse drug report files nor review of the literatureby the Directorate for Health Sciences revealed any reports of toxic ingestionsof powdered aspirin products by children under age five.The petitioner believes that this safety record for unflavored aspirinpowders is due to children's inability or unwillingness to consume toxicamounts of the drug, even if they gain access to it. The petitioner citedstudies conducted with young children using unit-dose packets of unflavoredaspirin powders. Results of the studies showed that the children were ableto open one or more packets but, having done so, were unable to transportthe powder to their mouths without spilling it. They were unable to pickup the powder with their fingers because of its texture; therefore, whendirected to do so, the children tasted the powder by inserting their fingersin it and licking their fingers, or by licking it directly from the table.Having once experienced the unpleasant taste, however, the majority ofthe children refused to open more than one or two units of the products.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Action On The Petition</ITAG>Human experience data show an absence of adverse effects associated withaccidental ingestions of unflavored aspirin powders, and studies indicatethat young children are not likely to consume a toxic amount of these products.The usage pattern of aspirin powders may provide an additional deterrentto accidental ingestion by young children. The petitioner reports thatunit-dose packages of aspirin powders are primarily purchased for immediateconsumption by adults at or near the place of purchase (<T3>e.g., </T3>restaurants, gas stations, newsstands), rather than forhousehold storage and possible access by young children.After considering the available information, the Commission preliminarilyconcludes that the degree and nature of the hazard to children presentedby the availability of the unflavored aspirin powders that are the subjectof this petition are such that special packaging is not required to protectchildren from serious personal injury or serious illness resulting fromhandling, or ingesting such substance. Accordingly, the Commission votedto grant the petition. Therefore, the Commission proposes below to amend16 CFR 1700.14(a)(1) to increase the exemption from requirements for child-resistantpackaging for unflavored aspirin powders (other than those intended bypediatric use) that are packaged in unit doses from 13 grains of aspirinper unit dose to 15.4 grains of aspirin per unit dose.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>When an agency undertakes a rulemaking proceeding, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) generally requires the agency to prepare proposed andfinal regulatory flexibility analyses describing the impact of the ruleon small businesses and other small entities. The purpose of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, as stated in section 2(b) (5 U.S.C. 602 note), is to requireagencies, consistent with their objectives, to fit the requirements ofregulations to the scale of the businesses, organizations, and governmentaljurisdictions subject to the regulations. Section 605 of the Act providesthat an agency is not required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysisif the head of an agency certifies that the rule will not have a significanteconomic impact of a substantial number of small entities.The exemption proposed below will have the effect of giving the manufacturersof the exempted products the option of packaging their product in an additionalmanner. The difference in cost between child-resistant packaging and packagingpermitted by the exemption is not believed to be significant. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this exemption will not have any significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">F. Environmental Considerations </ITAG>The Commission's regulation's governing environmental review proceduresstate, at 16 CFR 1021.5(c)(3), that exemption of products from requirementsfor child-resistant packaging under the PPPA normally has little or nopotential for affecting the human environment. The Commission does notforesee any special or unusual circumstances surrounding the exemptionproposed below. For this reason, the Commission concludes that neitheran environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is requiredin this proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="84">G. Effective Date </ITAG>Since the rule proposed below provides for an exemption, the provisionof 5 U.S.C. 553(c) requiring a delay in the effective date is inapplicable.Accordingly, the rule shall become effective upon publication of the finalrule in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 1700 </ITAG>Consumer protection, Drugs, Infants and children, Packaging and containers,Poison prevention, Toxic substances.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons given above, the Commission amends Title 16 of the Codeof Federal Regulations to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1700_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
