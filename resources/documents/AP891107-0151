Britain, France, Canada and the other 11 members of the councilall voted for the resolution, which would also have sent afact-finding mission to observe Israel's crackdown on thePalestinian uprising.   ``The United States is deeply distressed by the continuingviolence and confrontation in the occupied territories,'' said U.S.Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering.   ``We have repeatedly called on all parties to exercise maximumrestraint to avoid bloodshed and reduce tensions,'' he said.   Calling the anti-Israeli resolution ``one-sided,'' Pickeringsaid ``such resolutions and the divisive debate that accompaniesthem do not help to alleviate conditions in the areas, not do theyhelp to create an atmosphere conducive to the establishment ofconstructive dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.''   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud said afterward the U.S.veto ``renders hollow its claims of sensitivity and sympathy forthe Palestinian sufferings and its objections to Israel's clearviolations of Palestinian human and civil rights.''   ``The U.S. veto means that the Palestinians would remain hostageto Israel's brutal measures without a consequential protection bythe United Nations,'' Maksoud said.   Israel began tax raids on the predominantly ChristianPalestinian town of Beit Sahour on Sept. 20. Troops confiscated atleast $1.5 million in machinery, cars, household goods and personaleffects to be sold at auction.   Hanna Al-Atrash, the mayor of Beit Sahour, estimated 90 percentof the town of 10,000 people boycotted paying taxes to Israel toprotest the military occupation. Beit Sahour is just southeast ofBethlehem, in the West Bank.   Stinging under a storm of international criticism, Israel liftedits roadblocks around the town last week.   On Monday, Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein shifted the focus ofthe debate, describing the ax-murders or stabbings of fivePalestinians in October. The victims were mutilated, some in frontof family members or while praying in a mosque.   ``Indeed, the rate of PLO attacks against Palestinians increasedsharply following the promulgation of Israel's peace initiative inApril 1989,'' he said, saying seven times as many Palestinians werebeing attacked.</TEXT></DOC>
