A U.S. source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledgedbefore the meeting that Washington was all but isolated by allieswho want greater trade with fewer restrictions.   At the same time, the source said, the U.S. delegation feelsthat some countries, including West Germany and Italy, have notstrengthened export controls as promised.   The meeting of COCOM, the Coordinating Committee forMultilateral Export Controls, was expected to end Thursday. Untilthen, not even its location was to be disclosed.   COCOM, comprised of the 15 NATO nations and Japan and Australia,regulates trade in items to Soviet bloc nations.   The U.S. Embassy said three issues would dominate the agenda:streamlining the list of restricted items, improving exportcontrols and discussing political developments in the East.   COCOM's list of restricted items threatens to drive a wedgebetween the United States and its European allies.   U.S. officials contend that, in a new atmosphere of openness,Soviet engineers are acquiring restricted Western technology atwhat may be an unprecedented rate.   European governments insist the Bush administration is draggingits feet, reviewing the list item-by-item and retaining simpleitems that reached Moscow long ago.   They argue that changing philosophies in Eastern Europe putpolitical and economic pressure on them to expand trade.   Increasingly, COCOM partners accuse the United States of usingthe list to stifle foreign competitors of American manufacturers.They say that some U.S. companies are also guilty of infractions.   Recent U.S. intelligence findings report that more than 5,000machine tools have been sold illegally to the Soviet Union over thepast five years. The Kremlin depends on Western high-precision gearfor manufacturing military equipment.   Before the meeting Wednesday, Reginald Bartholomew, U.S.undersecretary of state for security assistance, visited Rome towarn that Olivetti might be banned from selling some items in theUnited States.   The Italian manufacturer was alleged to have exported to theSoviet Union machine tools used for making fighter aircraftengines. Olivetti also was reported to have sent technicians to theSoviet Union.   In a well-publicized case last year, Japan's Toshiba Machine Co.was accused of selling sophisticated equipment to the Soviet Unionin violation of COCOM regulations.   The United States claimed the equipment helped the Soviets buildquieter, harder to detect submarines, and it slapped severesanctions on Toshiba Machine and prohibited it from exporting tothe United States for three years.   On Wednesday, another Japanese firm, Tomei Shoji, was convictedof exporting electronic products to communist North Korea inviolation of COCOM rules. The trading firm and one if its employeeswere fined a total of $4,900. Two other employees were givensix-month prison terms.   Specialists say part of the problem is the political role ofexport industries in national economies.   Earlier this year, Defense Department officials showed TheAssociated Press an internal report identifying West Germany as``the greatest single source of transfers of sensitive technology''to the East.   The report blamed pressure from German business on a governmenteager for links to East Germany and the Soviet Union.   Even France, regarded as a relatively effective COCOM partner,has allowed serious leaks.   Earlier this year, French officials said they were investigatingthe apparent role of a government adviser in illegal sales toMoscow of machine tools used in making warplanes.</TEXT></DOC>
