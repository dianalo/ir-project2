Burdick, 80, A Retiring Fellow --- Age of the North Dakotan Is Both a Plus and a Minus In His Re-Election Bid </HL><AUTHOR> Dennis Farney (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BIO </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> GRAND FORKS, N.D.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   &quot;Grab my wrist,&quot; challenges the grandfatherly, 80-year-old senator.    And when you do, Quentin Burdick's gnarled right hand grabs your wrist -- bending it, hard enough to hurt. &quot;I'm taking it easy on you,&quot; he says.    The Democratic lawmaker learned that countermove in a Jhoon Rhee martial-arts school when he was a mere 65 or so. Later he appeared on the cover of Parade magazine wearing karate pajamas. The move is a way of breaking an opponent's grip. And that is exactly what Sen. Burdick seems close to doing in his curious Senate re-election race: breaking the grip of time.    By sheer bullheadedness, by ignoring each and every plea that he retire, and by staring down a younger and immensely popular fellow Democrat, Quentin Burdick avoided a primary challenge this year. Now, karate-chopping his Republican opponent with negative television ads, he leads by 25 percentage points, according to a recent poll.    Some say that despite his lead in the polls, when voters get into the privacy of the ballot booth they may finally make the retirement decision for him. But Quentin Burdick is not going gentle into that good night. He is not going anywhere, if he can help it. &quot;I'll give my seat to nobody, at no time,&quot; he barks at a press conference here. Another full term would give him 34 years in the Senate.    A Burdick win would mark a victory of age over youth -- and, Republicans here would argue, of cussedness over common sense. It would be a triumph of will for a man whose last name is interwoven with more than three-fourths of North Dakota's history since statehood in 1889.    During a career that ran from 1906 until his death in 1958, Usher Burdick was a Republican state representative, lieutenant governor and U.S. congressman. His son, &quot;Young Quentin&quot; -- as some North Dakotans still call him -- went to the U.S. House in 1958, the first Democrat this state ever sent there. In 1960 he won a special Senate election.    Today, Quentin Burdick is a chronically rumpled man who drives a beat-up 1968 Cadillac. His lone sartorial conceit is a made-in-Paris homburg. He looks, in the words of Congressional Quarterly's Politics in America reference book, &quot;like a man just awakened from a long legislative slumber.&quot;    Yet as a football player at the University of Minnesota in the days of the single-wing formation, he was a blocking back for the legendary Bronko Nagurski. As a young attorney, he once punched a complaining client down the courthouse stairs. At 73, he split boards with karate chops. And last year he defiantly declared: &quot;If you hear from anyone that my age is an impediment, name the gym, name the opponent and I'll be there.&quot;    Now the gym is North Dakota and the opponent is Republican Earl Strinden. Abrasive but effective, Mr. Strinden is a fighter to be reckoned with. Kent Conrad, North Dakota's other Democratic senator in Washington, calls him &quot;Ayatollah Earl.&quot; State colleagues have at times referred to him as &quot;Earl Strident.&quot;    As the veteran majority leader of the North Dakota House, the 56-year-old Mr. Strinden may have more power during the legislative session than the governor himself. He is known for the bills he has passed, the bills he has gutted -- and the enemies he has made.    People keep telling him to smile more, he said earlier this year. But &quot;there's something wrong with people who smile all the time. That's what we have mental health centers for.&quot;    The overriding issue here is age, one highlighted by the removal of a cancerous polyp and 18 inches of surrounding, healthy tissue from Sen. Burdick's colon last summer. The senator says doctors have given him &quot;the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.&quot; But a Strinden TV commercial, noting that a year ago 32 prominent North Dakota Democrats publicly urged Sen. Burdick to retire, keeps hammering away: &quot;Sometimes the truth is hard to take. . . . Quentin, listen to your own. It's time to come home.&quot;    Strinden aides produce a letter to the editor of the Fargo Forum from a visitor back from Washington. It describes Sen. Burdick as &quot;fast asleep&quot; amid Senate debate. Campaigning for Mr. Strinden, Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson portrays a lethargic Mr. Burdick whose actions as Environment Committee chairman are carefully scripted, who hews to prepared statements typed in half-inch-high letters and who takes directions from a committee aide whispering in his ear.    &quot;Quentin is a sweet guy,&quot; Sen. Simpson tells a Republican audience here. &quot;But Quentin would not be able to function without that fine young man.&quot;    The secondary issue in this race is clout -- whether Sen. Burdick has it, or even wants it.    The senator says his chairmanship, together with the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee he also heads, add up to a tremendous opportunity to help this state. &quot;I'd really feel like a traitor if I walked away from it,&quot; he says. Still, the striking fact is that it took Sen. Burdick 26 of his 28 years in the Senate to get his full committee chairmanship. Mostly, that is because he kept switching out of committees just before his seniority would have carried him to the top.    &quot;Quentin set a record,&quot; rails Mr. Strinden. &quot;It's historic; I don't think it will ever be equaled. Twenty-six years before getting a chairmanship. Twenty-six years!&quot;    The GOP candidate, respected if not loved as a legislative leader, seems to have neutralized Sen. Burdick on the clout issue. Yet he worries that Sen. Burdick is neutralizing him on the age issue.    &quot;Quentin's hospitalization threw things off for me,&quot; admits Mr. Strinden after a rally here. It lowered public expectations of Sen. Burdick, creating a Strinden dilemma when the two met recently for their only statewide, televised debate.    &quot;If I came on too strong it would look like I was too cruel,&quot; Mr. Strinden says. &quot;If I came on too pointed, it would look like I was too mean.&quot; In fact, the debate found him at one point cross-examining the senator like a prosecutor. But the consensus of the North Dakota press was that Sen. Burdick, although on the defensive, had scored points merely by surviving -- and looking feisty in the process.    &quot;It is,&quot; concludes Mr. Strinden, &quot;tough to attack an 80-year-old man.&quot;    Especially if he is stubborn. That was the lesson learned last year by the much younger Democrat who also had hoped to replace Sen. Burdick.    Rep. Byron Dorgan, now 46, may be North Dakota's most popular politician. A 1985 poll by the University of North Dakota found him swamping Sen. Burdick 70% to 23% in a trial heat. Rep. Dorgan clearly wanted to be senator. Influential state Democrats, including an ex-governor, publicly wanted him to be senator.    There was but one hitch: Sen. Burdick also wanted to be senator.    The incumbent blitzed Washington lobbyists for contributions. He vowed: &quot;If I'm able to stagger around from town to town, I'm running.&quot; A 1987 TV ad confronted the Dorgan challenge directly: &quot;You and I know there's a young congressman who'd like my job. He can have it -- someday.&quot; Rep. Dorgan backed down late last year.    Now Sen. Burdick savages his Republican opponent in television commercials. One accuses Mr. Strinden of proposing a budget cut that would have forced one-fourth of all North Dakota nursing-home residents from their homes. Mr. Strinden says he never advocated booting old folks into the street, but was merely trying to dramatize the tough choices needed to resolve a state budget crunch. The commercials have hurt. Mr. Strinden started the race with 27% of all voters viewing him negatively. &quot;By golly,&quot; he marvels, &quot;they've moved my negatives up to 37%.&quot; His own son jokingly told him he was tempted to change his last name.    The Republicans are counterattacking in kind. Before audiences, Mr. Strinden ridicules the Burdick legislative record by citing resolutions the incumbent has sponsored: &quot;National Ice Cream Day, National Ice Cream Month. . . .&quot; Convinced that he won the debate, he bought TV time to show it again.    Firing up GOP partisans here, Wyoming Sen. Simpson portrays Sen. Burdick as &quot;liberal with a capital L.&quot; But along the way, Sen. Simpson tells a story about his own father that, however inadvertently, seems to capture the spirit of the elderly North Dakota incumbent and his stubborn fight to stay in Washington.    &quot;Have you lived in Wyoming all your life?&quot; somebody asked the elder Mr. Simpson, who is 90. And the old man replied: &quot;Not yet.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
