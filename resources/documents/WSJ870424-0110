Do-it-yourself health testing allows us to prick, poke and probe ourselves as we screen for pregnancy, cardiovascular disease or abnormal blood conditions, all in the privacy of our homes.    Consumers' growing tendency to take charge of their own health has spurred some companies, hot on the trend, to respond with tests laypeople can do. And where there aren't yet consumer versions, some people are obtaining tests from doctors, hospital-supply stores or the manufacturers themselves.    Edward R. Pinckney, a Beverly Hills, Calif., internist and co-author of &quot;Do-it-Yourself Medical Testing,&quot; welcomes the trend. People who monitor their own health make better patients, Dr. Pinckney says: &quot;They don't get as sick. And when they do, it doesn't cost as much and they're not disabled as long.&quot;    Also, home tests are much cheaper than tests done in doctors' offices or labs -- an important factor in this era of rising pressure to contain medical costs. &quot;Take a blood-sugar test,&quot; Dr. Pinckney says. &quot;You can do that at home for about 40 cents. In a laboratory it will run anywhere from $6 to $60; (labs) charge what the traffic will bear.&quot;    Home tests aren't embraced by all doctors. Many oppose them because they cut into physicians' revenues. Others say there is too great a possibility that patients may receive false results after botching test procedures. Indeed, if not done correctly or improperly stored, tests can give wrong results.    Home testing is &quot;ultimately a net minus,&quot; says Paul Bachner, chairman of the pathology department at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. &quot;The opportunity for failure is so great.&quot;    In any case, physicians caution that home testing isn't meant to replace doctors, who ultimately must diagnose and treat illnesses. Ideally it should be done with their guidance.    Nevertheless, sales are gaining momentum. Frost andamp; Sullivan Inc., a market-research firm, estimates that over-the-counter (OTC) testing products posted sales of more than $396 million last year. Sales could top $700 million by 1991 as additional tests become available to consumers, Frost andamp; Sullivan says.    All tests need FDA approval to be marketed to the public. To get agency approval, a test has to demonstrate that it is 95% to 99% effective, as well as safe.    What follows, then, is a sampler of tests you can do at home.    Pregnancy   Introduced in 1978, these are among the most popular OTC tests. The leading test is EPT Plus by Warner-Lambert Corp., which comes in one-test ($12) or two-test ($16) packages.    A pellet is dropped into a test tube containing a sample of urine and turns the solution bright red. If the solution pales, pregnancy is indicated. The test, which its maker claims is 99% accurate, yields a result in as little as 10 minutes and detects pregnancy the first day of a missed menstruation.    Ovulation   This test pinpoints when a human egg is most likely to be fertilized -- critical information for women trying to become pregnant. First Response, a Tambrands Inc. product, is 99% accurate, the company says. It retails for about $30.    Blood and Urine Glucose   These tests make up the largest do-it-yourself category. Treated strips with a color scale allow diabetics to monitor blood-sugar levels constantly and alter insulin use or diet as necessary. The strips are credited with preventing many deaths and emergencies from diabetic complications.    Blood tests are more accurate than urine versions but more painful, requiring a finger prick to obtain a sample. These tests also can be used by non-diabetics to screen for low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. Miles Laboratories markets an OTC product called Glucostix -- 50 strips for about $25. Owned by Bayer AG in Germany, Miles also markets the $170 electronic Glucometer II, which scans a test strip and gives a digital readout.    Occult (Hidden) Blood   This screen for blood in the stool, an early warning sign of bowel or rectal cancer, is a marketing disaster. Low sales are blamed on its bearer-of-bad-news quality and the distasteful sample-collection procedures in some versions. With Warner-Lambert's Early Detector, which costs about $7, the patient uses a toilet-tissue-like pad, on which a special solution is sprayed. If blue areas appear then blood is present in the stool.    Urinary Infection   Eight million women daily suffer urinary tract infections that cause pain and other problems. Finding nitrite in urine can warn of infection before pain develops, allowing early treatment. Miles Labs makes MicroStix, an OTC test that costs about $3.50 for three test sticks.    Blood Pressure   It is common for a person visiting a doctor's office to experience some apprehension, or &quot;white-coat disease,&quot; which elevates blood pressure. Studies show that readings at home tend to be lower and, thus, more accurate. OTC models start at around $20. Marshall Electronics Inc. makes a $100 version with an automatically inflating cuff.    Sulfites   Used as preservatives in foods and beverages, these chemicals have stirred medical concern in recent years because they trigger allergic reactions, including nausea, diarrhea, hives and itching. CHEMetrics Inc. in Calverton, Va., sells a $19.50 kit containing 30 individual tests for food and drink samples.    Lung Function   Spirometers and peak flow meters gauge pulmonary performance, sometimes helping to predict the onset of asthmatic attacks and incipient heart trouble, since an early sign of both is worsening lung efficiency. Prices range from $13 to $150 and more. Biotrine Corp. in Woburn, Mass., makes a peak flow meter that can be obtained directly from the company. It costs $12.95.    Vision   An Amsler grid eye test is available directly from Minnesota Society for the Prevention of Blindness in St. Paul for $1. It helps screen for a degenerative retinal conditions and other problems that could result in vision loss or blindness.    The user focuses on a dot at the center the grid. If any of the squares around the dot disappear, grow crooked or otherwise change, it is a warning to see a doctor immediately.    Radiation   These kits monitor exposure to radioactive sources ranging from X-rays to radon and nuclear power plants. Devices range from simple radiation sensitive cards to Geiger counters. Prices range from less than $10 to more than $300.    The number of testing products is expected to grow. While manufacturers have been slowed by the difficulty of making some lab tests idiot-proof, tests for strep throat, cholesterol and osteoporosis are expected. Manufacturers also are working on tests to monitor prescription drug levels and nutritional status.    Tests for venereal diseases face cloudier prospects. The federal Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control have expressed concern about home testing for diseases that by law must be reported to public health officials.    ---   Mr. James reports on science and medicine from The Wall Street Journal's Chicago bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
