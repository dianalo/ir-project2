Kennedy, &quot;At some future date the high court ofhistory sits in judgment on each of us, recording whether in our brief spanof service we fulfilled our responsibilities to the state.andP;  .  .  .&quot;  To thatend, Hidden Agenda provides a news synopsis printed 100 years after the endof your term in office.andP;  It details the accomplishments or failures of youradministration.andP;  That is the time to decide whether or not you weresuccessful in implementing your political agenda.andM;List Price: Hidden Agenda, $59.95.andP;  Requires: 512K RAM, CGA or EGA, DOS 2.0or later.andP;  Not copy protected.andP;  Springboard Software Inc., 7808 CreekridgeCircle, Minneapolis, MN 55435; (612) 944-3915.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
