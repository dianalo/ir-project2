The single headstone at St. Pancras Cemetery says they died in``the terrible fire.''   The men were buried a day after an official report blamedmanagement complacency and lax safety measures for the Nov. 18 blazethat killed 31 people in the King's Cross subway station.   The fire was found to have been caused by a lighted match droppedon a wooden escalator.   Gerald Isaaman, chairman of the King's Cross Disaster Fund, saidthe fund's trustees ``decided to bury them on Armistice Day _ a dayof remembrance.'' Armistice Day commemorates the end of World War I.   ``It is sad to think that two people can die and never be missedin our community,'' said Canon Douglas Bean, vicar of St. PancrasChurch, who conducted the funeral service. ``It is a reflection ofcity life in the age in which we live.''   One man is still known only as ``115'' _ the registration numberhis body was given at the hospital. Police couldn't identify him,even after checking 5.5 million fingerprints and circulating photosof an expert reconstruction of his face.   The other victim was identified as Ralph Humberstone by a formeremployer, but no family or friends were traced.   ``We felt that they ought to receive a proper, decent burial, andthat they should be remembered,'' said Douglas Platts, manager ofthe disaster fund. ``We chose a single grave because they were twolonely souls who died together and therefore we thought itappropriate they should be buried together.''   The 13 mourners included the mayor and former mayor of Camden,the borough which includes King's Cross, members of the trust fundand Aileen Walker-Smith, director of the King's Cross Support Groupwhich has been helping families and survivors.   A 250-page report, based on an inquiry that went on 91 days, wasreleased Thursday and prompted the resignation of the subways' twotop managers. It blamed executive complacency and an``uncoordinated, haphazard and untrained'' staff response for thedisaster.</TEXT></DOC>
