For the past four years, negotiators in the Uruguay Roundof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have beendiscussing ways to bring trade in garments and textiles underGATT. The final series of negotiations will begin in Genevain July, with a December deadline set for a wholesalerevision of GATT.</LP><TEXT>   Representatives of the 22-member International Textilesand Clothing Bureau met in Hong Kong last week to draft theorganization's negotiating stance for the July meeting ofGATT. Formed in 1985, the bureau comprises developingnations, such as Indonesia and Mexico, and newlyindustrialized countries, such as South Korea and Hong Kong.Its members account for between 50% and 60% of the world'sannual exports of garments and textiles.   Many contentious trade issues remain for the 96-memberGATT, whose protocols have governed most of world trade since1948. Among the issues are disputes over agriculturalsubsidies, protection of intellectual property and marketaccess for such services as banking and insurance.   But trade in garments and textiles may prove to be thethorniest item on the agenda in the final six months ofbargaining. It also is an issue that sharply divides thedeveloped countries, particularly the U.S., and thedeveloping nations. Rather than a so-called North-Southissue, however, many see textiles as a touchstone for thefree-trade system that GATT was formed to uphold.   &quot;It is important for the Uruguay Round that textilenegotiations succeed,&quot; Hassan Kartadjoemena, chairman of lastweek's conference of the International Textiles and ClothingBureau, told a news conference.   &quot;For many countries, it is inconceivable to have asuccessful round if there is no success in the handling oftextiles,&quot; said Mr. Kartadjoemena, who holds the rank ofambassador as Indonesia's special representative to themultilateral trade negotiations in Geneva.   Since 1974, international trade in garments and textileshas been governed by the Multi-Fiber Arrangement. The MFA,which expires in July 1991, exists separately from GATTbecause GATT doesn't allow quantitative restrictions ontrade.   The MFA allows nations to restrict imports of garments andtextiles through bilateral agreements between the importingand exporting countries. The agreements aim to set importquotas that provide reasonable protection for manufacturersin the importing nations while still allowing for growth intrade.   For the most part, industrialized nations argue that theMFA quota system is needed to protect their manufacturersfrom inexpensive imports produced by low-wage, developingnations. The developing countries argue that the quotasrestrict their ability to sell abroad, thus crimping economicgrowth.   Most GATT members favor phasing out the MFA and its quotasystem, eventually governing trade in garments and textilesunder the same rules as trade in other goods. However, thereis wide disagreement on the phase-out process among thosenations that have stated positions -- and both the U.S. andCanada have proposed new &quot;global quota&quot; systems for theinterim period.   The U.S., the largest market for many of the textilebureau's members, has proposed integrating the MFA into GATTafter a 10-year transition period to begin in January 1992.But during the transition, there would be a new global quotasystem and tariff rate. The global quotas would have bothspecific country allocations covering current bilateralagreements and a &quot;global basket&quot; that would expand to providegrowth. Each year, the specific country quotas would shrinkwhile the basket would expand.   Critics of the global-quotas proposals argue that aprogressive phase-out of the existing MFA would be lessdisruptive than the institution of any new system. They alsosay the global quotas threaten to be tighter than existingones.</TEXT></DOC>
