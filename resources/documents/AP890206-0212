Here is the story of Jason,one of those.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By PAUL DE LA GARZA</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>SOUTH ROXANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lonely yellow stick character, armsoutstretched, looks down at 8-year-old Jason Robertson from a posterin his kitchen.   ``I have AIDS,'' the poster says. ``Please hug me. I can't makeyou sick.''   As if it were Jason speaking.   Jason suffers from AIDS-related complex, or ARC, a disease thatoften precedes the fatal full-blown acquired immune deficiencysyndrome. At school, he was isolated in a trailer next door to theclassroom, and his only real friend was a tattered doll named Mick.   Jason's story is similar to the plight of Indiana's Ryan White,an AIDS victim shunned at school and forced to leave town.   Jason is the only student in the school trailer.   He has endured a lawsuit and a move from nearby Granite City tothis tiny, Southern Illinois community in search of peace. Phonecalls playing funeral music and taunts added to the scorn.   Now his mother, Tammie, father, Al, and 10-year-old sister,Melissa, are picking up the pieces after a struggle that turnedneighbor against neighbor in a battle over Jason's future.   Jason weighs only 46 pounds and stands about 4 feet tall. Hismost striking features are his big brown eyes. A quiet boy, heanswers most questions with few words.   ``I like good people,'' Jason says. ``I like to go places.''   When he grows up, he says, he wants to be a police officer.   Jason was born with hemophilia, a condition in which the bloodfails to clot properly. He also had stomach problems and a shortenedesophagus _ problems that were corrected by surgery.   But he underwent hundreds of blood transfusions, and at least oneof them involved tainted blood products that brought the deadly AIDSvirus into his body. In March 1986, Jason was diagnosed with ARC.   That was the beginning. Now the family, its former schooldistrict and neighbors wish they had done some things differently.   Fearing he would endanger other children, his mother pulled himfrom kindergarten in Granite City and a district tutor taught him athome until November 1987.   That's when the Robertsons and the school district agreed thatJason should be taught in a special trailer 50 feet from regularclasses.   Jason started school 15 minutes before the other students everyday and left 15 minutes later than they did. He was not allowed onthe playground.   School officials say they told Mrs. Robertson that Jason probablywould be placed in regular classes at the school of 750 in the fallof 1988 because his health had improved.   But Mrs. Robertson contends the district made the offer onlyafter the American Civil Liberties Union, at her request, filed alawsuit on Jason's behalf in April.   On May 5, a federal judge ordered Jason back into regularclasses. But the ruling touched off protests from parents in GraniteCity, a steel town of 36,800 across the Mississippi River from St.Louis.   Angry parents chanted, ``Back to the trailer!'' upon his arrival.   Drew Callender, 29, says he got into the fight because of angerand fear for his children's safety. ``I did say some foolishthings.'' He also founded an informal group of protesting parentscalled ``SAVE,'' the Society Against Virus Environment.   ``It's a fear of not knowing,'' he says.   Mrs. Robertson says she got up to three telephone calls a dayfrom protesters, threatening her and Jason. People hurled epithetson the street. ``Home had become a war zone, and I felt like I wasdying inside,'' she says.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
