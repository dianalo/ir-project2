Gorbachev will meet Pope John Paul II forthe first time when the Soviet president travels to Italy inNovember, the Soviet ambassador to Italy says.   ``Yes, why not,'' replied Ambassador Nikolai Lunkov whenreporters in Genoa asked him Saturday if Gorbachev would meet withthe pope during the visit.   Although such a meeting has been considered likely, neither theVatican nor the Kremlin had confirmed it will take place. ThePolish-born pontiff earlier this year said he would be ready toreceive Gorbachev.   It would be the first meeting between the leader of the world's850 million Roman Catholics and the head of the Soviet CommunistParty, which disparages religion.   The Soviet ambassador spoke to reporters in Genoa at the ItalianCommunist Party's annual festival. The party's newspaper, L`Unita,also quoted Lunkov as praising the Roman Catholic Church's effortsfor peace in the world.   Asked whether Moscow would open an embassy to the Holy See,Lunkov said such things take time. ``One must be realistic abouteverything.''   The Vatican has reportedly been preparing for a Gorbachev visitsince the Soviet leader sent a letter to the pope in August.Gorbachev expressed interest in meeting the pontiff to ``talkbusiness'' about historically troubled Vatican-Soviet relations,according to a senior Vatican official.   In Moscow, Soviet sources said Gorbachev is expected to visitItaly starting Nov. 25.   The Vatican official said the letter from Gorbachev was deliveredto the pope last month by Yuri Karlov, an aide to Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   Chief topics for a Gorbachev-pope meeting, the Vatican officialsaid, would be the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania, wherethere are large numbers of Roman Catholics, and the UkrainianCatholic Church, which is a major stumbling block to improvedVatican-Moscow ties.   The Vatican does not recognize the annexation of Lithuania by theSoviet Union in 1940, and a Lithuanian exile mission is accreditedto the Holy See.   The Ukrainian Catholic Church was forcibly merged with theRussian Orthodox Church under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1946.But there is a strong underground Ukrainian church and Ukrainianfaithful have been carrying out public protests seeking officialrecognition of their church.</TEXT></DOC>
