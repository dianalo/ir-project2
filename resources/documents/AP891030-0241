The governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, told theannual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund inWashington on Sept. 27 that despite setbacks, its policy ofeconomic reform and opening to the outside world ``shall never bealtered.''   In corporate boardrooms worldwide, executives still tantalizedby China's 1 billion consumers have been quick to respond,restaffing long-established joint ventures there.   ``Virtually all representatives from foreign businesses havebeen back from Aug. 15 on,''said Chuck Conroy, who directs Asianpractices for Baker andamp; McKenzie, the world's largest law firm andone of the first to establish a presence in China.   Widespread speculation of a drop in agricultural trade hasproved unfounded. Helped by strong business since Tiananmen Square,commodity sales to China, mostly cotton and wheat, are expected tobe around $1.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, morethan double the previous year.   In addition, World Bank President Barber Conable said recentlyhe hoped to resume lending to China soon. Seven loans totalingnearly $800 million were suspended after the Tiananmen Squareconfrontation.   Most foreign companies are still quietly tabling proposals tosend new capital and personnel into China. But like Conable, theyhave only economic, not moral, qualms. They are looking for moresigns of stability.   Even that, and the loss of more than $1 billion in tourism, maydo little to upset relations. Analysts point out that China'seconomy was overheated anyway, and the crackdown gives China'sleaders an opportunity to check inflation and excessive growth.   In Washington and most major foreign capitals, a chill hassettled over relations with China. Many Western governments did notsend representatives to the carefully orchestrated anniversarycelebration.   Mostly, however, caution reigns.   ``If the premise is that George Bush hasn't been going out ofhis way to make headlines, that's true,'' said a U.S. governmentofficial in Washington who asked not to be identified. Earlier thisfall, the president deflected a reporter's question about Chinawith a terse ``It's not time for normalcy.''   The Bush administration barred high-level contacts with Chineseofficials and sales of military equipment after the crackdown, thenfell silent.   Japan, China's No. 1 trading partner and No. 1 lender, also haskept most official contacts at a low level and has not openednegotiations on new developmental loans. Few Japanese businessesare launching new projects.   ``We are also very cautious'' in dealing with already-agreedloans to China, ``because we do not want to give the impressionthat we condone now what we criticized before,'' said TaizoWatanabe, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry.   Yet, ``in the hotels in Beijing all you see are Japanesebusinessmen,'' said Dernberger, who recently visited China.``They've already changed and gone back to business as usual.''   For most Westerners, however, business as usual means havinglittle to do with China, and this may be another reason for thetepid response to Tiananmen Square.   ``I think there's less concern for human rights in China than inSouth Africa or in Latin America,'' said Spence.   ``It might be due to the racial consciousness in the UnitedStates. We can identify with South Africa. It might be due to alongstanding historical condition that the Chinese are notpermitted such freedom by their governments. ... What was excitingwas the struggle to be free.''   Those who recognize that most poignantly, perhaps, are thethousands of expatriate Chinese students who protested on collegecampuses in June. Today, many of them are silent as well, fearfulof retaliation against family and friends in China _ and of theirown futures.   ``In June students were furious about that kind of massacre. Itwas very emotional. They had to speak out,'' said Lian Chao Han,vice president of the Independent Federation of Chinese Studentsand Scholars in Washington.   ``After they cooled down, they really thought that they don'twant to harm their families,'' he said. ``Right now ... they don'tknow what they're going to do.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 5</NOTE></DOC>
