Agents of the U.S. Secret Service and Michigan statepolice ran the five-month undercover investigation, dubbedOperation Rollerskate, out of a cellular phone store theagency set up in downtown Detroit.</LP><TEXT>   According to the authorities, the evidence gatheredconfirms a crime wave that is siphoning an estimated $200million in annual revenue from cellular carriers nationwideand shows how dependent drug and gun dealers have become oncellular phones and beepers. One customer offered to tradehis &quot;streetsweeper,&quot; a heavy machine gun, for one of thephones, said James G. Huse Jr., special agent in charge atthe Secret Service's Detroit office.   The &quot;AutoFone&quot; store on Detroit's drug-infested west sidetraded free phone service for cash, drugs and guns.   Thieves have been selling phones altered electronically toprovide free service or submitting fraudulent applications toobtain unbillable service. Mr. Huse said future stings willbe conducted in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.   Federal agents and state police raided a total of ninebusinesses and private homes in Detroit and arrested at least11 people. They were charged with &quot;fraud and related activityin connection with access devices,&quot; a felony punishable by upto 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Also seized werebusiness records and cellular telephones, which &quot;shouldpretty much put them out of business for awhile,&quot; said Mr.Huse, who called the crackdown &quot;phase one of a two-phasebust.&quot;   In the second phase, he said, agents will arrest more than50 suspects allegedly involved in cellular fraud, drugdealing and gun running, probably within a month. &quot;The legalsystem can only absorb so much; some of the cases will betransferred to DEA {Drug Enforcement Agency} and stateauthorities,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got a couple of years ofinvestigative leads here. We almost have too muchintelligence from this.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
