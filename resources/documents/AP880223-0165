(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials of the ChristianBroadcasting Network said Tuesday it will stop showing ``The JimmySwaggart Telecast'' while the Assemblies of God minister is underchurch-supervised probation.   ``CBN will air, this coming Sunday, a piece we did on ReverendSwaggart's service last Sunday,'' said Benton Miller, a CBNspokesman. ``After that point, we will not be airing any Swaggartprogramming during the probation.''   Swaggart, a Baton Rouge, La., televangelist, told hiscongregation Sunday that he had sinned but gave no specificsfollowing allegations of sexual misconduct.   The Louisiana presbytery of the Assemblies of God voted Mondayto bar him from preaching for three months and have him undergo twoyears of rehabilitation. The national presbytery will make thefinal decision.   Miller said CBN would decide after the three-month probationwhether to resume carrying the program.
