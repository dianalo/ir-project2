Until June 19, 1987, each of the Advisers was controlled by Smith BarneyInc. (``SBI''). SBI was a holding company engaged, primarily through SmithBarney, in investment banking and brokerage businesses. Pursuant to a May26, 1987 agreement between NY Acquisitions Inc. (``NY Acquisition''), awholly-owned subsidiary of Primerica Corporation (``Primerica''), and SBI,NY Acquisition was merged into SBI on June 19, 1987 (the ``Closing Date'')and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Primerica. Each of the former,pre-merger management agreements (the ``Former Agreements'') of the Fundsprovided that it would terminate upon ``assignment'' as such is definedin section 2(a)(4) of the 1940 Act. The merger (``Merger'') of NY Aquisitioninto SBI and the consequent passing of control from the shareholders ofSBI to Primerica may be deemed to have resulted in an assignment and terminationof the Former Agreements under the 1940 Act. 2. Smith Barney is a registered investment adviser and a registered broker/dealerengaged in the securities underwriting and securities and commodities brokeragebusiness. Smith Barney has served as investment manager to VMM since theFund's commencement of operations in October 1982. 3. SBA, a registered investment adviser, has been the investment managerto SBEF since July 1968 and to SBF since February 1972. (Smith Barney isthe subadviser for each of SBEF and SBF and as such is compensated by SBAand not by SBEF or SBF.)4. MMC, a registered investment adviser, has been the investment managerto NLR since February 1979, to TFM since April 1982 and to MBF since itscommencement of operations in August 1986. 5. On June 3,1987, the directors and Trustees of the Funds, including theindependent directors and Trustees, unanimously authorized entering intothe interim agreements (``Interim Agreements'') which were identical tothe Former Agreements, including the fees payable by the Funds, exceptthat any such fees or alternatively the costs incurred by the Advisers,were payable on a retroactive basis, subject to shareholder approval ofnew agreements and receipt of an order by the Commission. The directorsand Trustees also caused new agreements (``New Agreements'') to be submittedto the shareholders of the Funds (the proxy soliciting period for whichcommenced on the day following the Closing Date), and authorized the filingof an application for exemption from section 15(a) of the 1940 Act. On July 17, 1987, the shareholders of the Funds approved the New Agreementsbetween the Funds and their respective Advisers and subadvisers, at whichtime the New Agreements became effective. 6. When considering the Interim Agreements, the directors and Trusteesof the Funds determined that any change in control of SBI as a result ofthe anticipated merger would not have a detrimental effect on the abilityof the Advisers to provide the same advisory and other services as werethen being provided to the Funds. There were no changes in the business,corporate structure, capitalization, or composition of senior managementor personnel of SBI or its subsidiary Advisers as a result of the merger.Smith Barney remained autonomous as a subsidiary of Primerica, continuingto operate under the same name and under the same management. After thetechnical assignments, there were no changes in the investment advisoryand other services provided to the Funds and the directors of all of theAdvisers remained the same. Each Fund continued to receive the same services,as provided by the same personnel.7. The negotiations for the Merger commenced in early May and their rapidculmination did not present the opportunity to secure prior approval ofthe new Agreements by shareholders of the Funds. In addition to the financialand other business terms of the Merger, Primerica,, NY Acquisition andSBI concluded, in light of the disruptions that could occur if a securitiesfirm announced the existence of merger negotiations, that the negotiationsand the terms of the anticipated Merger should be maintained on a strictlyconfidential basis. Expeditious consummation of the Merger following anypublic announcement was essential to assure that the integrity of the transactionwas preserved. Accordingly, access to the knowledge that negotiations wereunderway was closely circumscribed by SBI and its affiliates. The Funds'management had less than one month from the date of the public announcementon May 27th until the Closing Date to convene Boards of Directors (Trustees)Meetings, to draft and file with the SEC proxy soliciting materials formeetings of shareholders of the Funds and to file the application. 8. Applicants filed the application seeking, to the extent necessary, permissionfor Advisers to: (i) Have served as investment advisers to the Funds, andfor Smith Barney to have served as subadviser with respect to SBF and SBEFpursuant to the Interim Agreements (from June 19, 1987, until July 17,1987); (ii) receive from each of the Funds, after an order of the Commissionis issued, for the fees that were it not for the Merger, would have beenpayable under the Former Agreements, as further reduced by voluntary feewaivers. The fees subsequently determined for the Interim period were $1,520,924;(iii) as an alternative to the said fees, receive amounts equal to thecosts incurred by the Advisers during the Interim period in providing theservices performed under the Interim Agreement, but in no event would suchamounts exceed the fees otherwise payable under the Interim Agreements,as further reduced by voluntary fee waivers of the Advisers. Based on SmithBarney's fully costed allocation methodology contained in the application,the lesser of minimum costs or fees per Fund (or series) aggregated forall Funds (series) was $915,143 during the Interim Agreement.10. Applicants state that the time between the filing of amendments tothe application was expended on preparing the historical cost data andfinancial analysis included in the application. Simultaneous with the costdata research, the personnel for Applicants were also developing strategicplanning for Smith Barney. In addition, the market break of October 19,1987 put further strain on the same individuals who were called upon torespond and react to the effects of the market break. 11. The cost data submitted in the application consists of direct expensesand indirect expenses. The method of allocating, on a full costed basis,direct and indirect expenses of the Advisers with respect to their advisoryservices to the Funds is consistent with the method currently used by SmithBarney senior executives to monitor product profitability on an allocatedbasis. For a more complete description of Applicants' methodology, seepages 27-30 of the application. 12. Applicants shall not rely on any order of the Commission prior to itsissuance as authority for the Advisers serving as investment advisers tothe Funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Conclusions</ITAG>1. Section 15(a)(4) is intended, in part, to protect an investment companyand its shareholders from the trafficking in advisory contracts. The requestedrelief does not contravene the protection afforded by this section becausethe Merger was not contingent on either receipt of the relief requestedin the application or shareholder approval of the New Agreements. Applicantssubmit that it would have served no useful purpose to await shareholderapproval of the New Agreements prior to the Merger. 2. The exemption would be consistent with the policies of Rule 15a-4 underthe 1940 Act. Applicants are unable to rely upon Rule 15a-4 because ofthe receipt of compensation from the assignment.3. The rapid culmination of the merger negotiations did not present theopportunity to secure prior shareholder approval of the New Agreements.4. Denying Advisers the lesser of fees or reimbursement of costs wouldbe a harsh result and would not afford shareholders any extra protection.The Advisers were responsible for managing assets aggregating more than$4.9 billion pursuant to the Interim Agreements, but for which they areentitled to no compensation, including costs, by the terms of the InterimAgreements, absent the relief requested in the application. Managementfees that SBA and MMC receive represent substantially all of their revenues.5. The independent Directors and independent Trustees of the Funds determinedthat continuity of the Advisers' services to the Funds was advantageousto the Funds. Any change in the Advisers' operations may have had a disruptiveeffect on the Funds.In evaluating the effect of the Merger on the Advisers' ability to continueto provide services to the Funds, the independent directors and independentTrustees received and considered information as to Primerica's businessorganization and financial resources, personnel and other matters. Theyconsidered it significant that the acquisition would have no material adverseeffect on the Advisers' ability to provide services to the Funds.6. The requested order will enable the Advisers to receive with respectto the Interim Agreement period the lower of fees or costs from the Funds,as set forth in the New Agreements and approved by shareholders. The termsof the Interim Agreements state that any payment is subject to the grantingof a Commission order and shareholder approval of the New Agreements. TheAdvisers have borne the costs of preparing and filing the original applicationand all amendments thereto and the costs of the special meetings of shareholders,including the expenses of preparing, printing and mailing proxy statementsto solicit shareholder approval of the New Agreements (except that onlyNLR bore the foregoing costs in connection with its annual meeting of shareholders,other than a portion of such costs allocable to consideration of NLR'sproposed agreement which was paid by MMC).7. It is in the public interest, in the interest of investors and otherwiseconsistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act that an investment companybe able to continue to receive, despite circumstances that may be deemedto be an assignment of the contract, the uninterrupted services of itsinvestment adviser, which performs pursuant to a contract previously approvedby its shareholders.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Managment, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Shirley E.
