It blasts the accord, which gradually eliminates tariffs and guarantees each country access to each other's markets. Siding with critics who say the pact will allow the U.S. to further dominate Canada's economy, the paper calls the accord a &quot;sellout of Canadian sovereignty.&quot;    In these days of chain-owned papers with polite editorial positions carefully corralled on opinion pages, Mr. Honderich is a press tycoon out of the old school: He uses his paper to sound off. While he's dismissed as an agitator by some, his influence is widely acknowledged, and he's wielding his clout over the trade agreement.    Fans of the free-trade pact say the Star's news columns are one-sided. &quot;The news coverage has been clearly biased and relentlessly anti-American,&quot; says Conrad Black, chairman of Hollinger Inc., a newspaper publisher. Even the Star's ombudsman, Rod Goodman, concedes an &quot;imbalance in the news columns&quot; against free trade. Canadian diplomat Simon Reisman, who negotiated the trade agreement, has accused the Star of &quot;printing false information&quot; and waging a &quot;vendetta.&quot;    None of this fazes Mr. Honderich, publisher of the Star for more than 20 of his 68 years. &quot;I don't know Mr. Reisman and I didn't think twice about what he said,&quot; says Mr. Honderich, who denies that the coverage has been unfair. &quot;But I suppose it depends on how you view free trade.&quot;    Or on which newspaper you read. The Star and the rival Globe and Mail recently covered the same government hearing on the impact of free trade. The Star's headline: &quot;400,000 workers put in jeopardy by free trade deal, Ontario charges.&quot; The Globe's: &quot;Advisers are optimistic over benefits of pact.&quot;    Says one Star reporter: &quot;Everybody knows that if you want to get on page one . . . the way to play a (free trade) story is to take the negative angle, shoot it right up to the top of the story and hit it as hard as you can.&quot;    Of course, the paper has its supporters. &quot;I think the Star should be commended for the depth of its economic analysis,&quot; says Mel Hertig, who heads the Council of Canadians, a group that opposes further American investment. &quot;They've bent over backwards to deliver a perspective that isn't being presented by the rest of the media.&quot;    The Star has always espoused Canadian nationalism and populist causes, from socialized medicine to stiff controls on foreign investment. &quot;My primary responsibility as publisher is to carry on the reform traditions of Joseph Atkinson,&quot; says Mr. Honderich. Mr. Atkinson was editor in 1899, and later became the owner of the Star until his death in 1948. His will stipulated that any new owners of the Star had to carry on his reformist views.    Mr. Honderich began his own newspaper career in the early 1930s as a part-time reporter for the Kitchener (Ontario) Record, earning 10 cents a column-inch. He joined the Star as a reporter in 1942. The paper was then known as a sensationalist mouthpiece for Canada's Liberal Party.    That changed after Mr. Honderich became editor in chief in 1955. He turned it into a quality newspaper by hiring top writers, promoting in-depth articles, toning down its partisan news coverage and redesigning the layout. He &quot;understood the daily newspaper was changing from being the primary source of news to becoming a source of service and news background information,&quot; says Ron Haggart, a former Star columnist.    After Mr. Atkinson's son-in-law died in 1957, Mr. Honderich and a group of directors acquired control of the Star. Mr. Honderich is chairman and chief executive officer of Torstar Corp., the Star's owner, and he holds 14% of the company. Torstar also owns Harlequin Enterprises Ltd., the world's biggest publisher of romance fiction. Mr. Honderich says the free-trade pact won't hurt any of Torstar's businesses.    Today, the Star has an editorial staff of about 400 and its average daily circulation of 523,000 matches the total of Toronto's two other dailies.    Mr. Honderich says he isn't the hands-on publisher he used to be. In his hands-on days, he waged battles with his editors that are legendary. Mel Morris, a former Star assistant managing editor, recalls that &quot;sometimes after the first edition was on the streets, Beland would rip the paper apart, denounce most of it, and you'd have to start over.&quot; Peter Newman, a former Star editor in chief, says, &quot;It was difficult to follow Beland's instructions because he was so certain about what he didn't want, but not quite so certain about how it should be done.&quot;    Not surprisingly, the Star has had 11 managing editors over the past 24 years. Says Mr. Haggart, the former columnist, &quot;To Beland, editorial executives only had a limited supply of ideas and energy and, when you used them up, it was time to recyle them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
