DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors for the first time havebrought racketeering charges against a lawyer accused of insidertrading.   The lawyer, Alfred Elliott, 44, of Melbourne Beach, Fla., wasone of 12 people indicted Tuesday for alleged financial crimes.   He is accused of making $680,000 in illegal profits usinginformation he obtained while a partner of the law firm Schiff,Hardin andamp; Waite in Chicago.   ``This is the first time in history we've used the racketeeringstatute in an insider trading case,'' said U.S. Attorney AntonValukas.   The racketeering statute provides greater penalties and givesthe government more power to seize illicit gains than other lawsprohibiting insider trading, the prosecutor said.   Elliott is charged with wire fraud, securities fraud,racketeering and filing a false income tax return.   If convicted on all counts, he could receive up to 363 years inprison and $13.5 million in fines and be forced to make restitutionof any illegal profits.   ``In the future, we expect to use the racketeering laws as apowerful weapon in these cases,'' Valukas said.   Nine times in 1984 through 1986, Elliott learned of largepending stock acquisitions by clients, then invested heavily in thecompany whose stock was being bought, the government said.   The deals involved stock in Portec Inc., Pearle Health ServicesInc. and Rival Manufacturing Co., prosecutors said.   Directory assistance for Melbourne Beach had no listing forElliott. His former law firm said it had no knowledge of hiswhereabouts.   Eight of the 12 people indicted Tuesday are accused in aseparate $1.2 million scheme of churning accounts, in which brokerstrade on customers' accounts merely to generate commissions.   ``None of the 120 customers, most of whom were solicited bytelephone, ever made a profit,'' said Valukas.   The government said the alleged scheme was carried out byofficers and employees of Whitehall Investors International Inc.,based in Chicago with branches in Irvine, Calif., and Boca Raton,Fla.   Those indicted include Walter S. Josten, an owner and presidentof Whitehall, who could face 105 years in prison if convicted.   Three independent traders also were indicted in an investigationat the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They are accused ofparticipating in fraudulent trading involving Jeffrey G. Donnelly,a former broker with CRT Services Inc. Donnelly pleaded guilty tofraud in February and was sentenced to three years in prison.   The government said Donnelly took successful trades he executedfor his company and make it appear they had been made for one ofthe three traders.   Valukas said more than $700,000 was illegally diverted to thedefendants, while Donnelly got a 35 percent cut.</TEXT></DOC>
