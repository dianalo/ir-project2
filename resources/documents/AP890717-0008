Since May, when Bulgaria first started deporting ethnic Turks andthen gave passports to others who wanted to leave, 135,000 havecrossed into Turkey, according to officials in this border city.   So far, a wave of ethnic solidarity has allwed Turkey to smoothlyabsorb the influx.   The 1-million-strong Turkish minority in Bulgarian has beensubjected to a government assimilation campaign that forces them toadopt Slavic names, bans the use of Turkish in public and restrictstheir Moslem religious rites.   Each day about 3,500 people pour in and within a few days mostleave for jobs and new homes or move in with relatives who emigratedseveral decades ago, said the provincial governor, Unal Erkan.   A refugee camp of white conical tents, set up on a treeless plotnext to the railroad station, has become a way station. There,representatives of employers from around the country meet withimmigrants seeking work.   Hayrettin Aydin came from the Black Sea port city of Giresun tohire 10 workers for his mining company. ``We saw these peoplearriving with their few belongings on the TV news. We were moved, wewanted to help,'' he said.   He struck a deal with two young men in their 20's. One of them,Ercan Kurtulus, said: ``as long as we have a job and a place to staywe don't care what or where. There is no going back to Bulgaria.''   Companies offering jobs to the immigrants say most of them areskilled workers and that ethnic Turks who settled here beforeestablished a reputation for hard work.   Turkey, with a population of 55 million, has a 16 percentunemployment rate but in most areas there is a shortage of skilledworkers. Welders, fork lift operators and electricians are in demand.   But there is a dark side to the hiring story. Some companies havefired native workers to replace them with labor from Bulgariathinking they can get them cheaper, union leaders say. Thegovernment has pledged to stop the practice by fining the companiesinvolved.   ``This is a very sensitive matter,'' said Necdet Kilic, a leaderof the Bulgarian immigrant community. ``We don't want resentmentsand bad blood between the people here and the immigrants.''   Aid to the refugees comes in many forms. On a bulletin board atthe Edirne camp there are letters offering to marry widowed orsingle women among the immigrants. One recent offer came from HasanCamci, 75, who was looking for a ``suitable mate.''   At one corner of the camp, next to the water fountains, a localbarber gives free haircuts to new arrivals. Boys get freecircumcision, an Islamic practice banned by the Bulgarians.   Turkey's workers in Europe, home for the Feast of Sacrifice, oneof Islam's two major holidays, have contributed the equivalent of$187,000, officials said.   ``Some people bring a crate of tomatoes, others a few freshlybaked pies,'' said Gov. Erkan.   Some 400 trucks transport immigrants and their belongings fromthe border to other parts of the country. Taking advantage of thesummer season, local authorities have thrown open boarding schoolsand university dormitories to arrivals as temporary shelter.   But ethnic Turks who immigrated earlier and settled mainly inwestern parts of the country play the biggest part in the aid effort.   In the low income Sefakoy district of Istanbul _ where earlierarrivals from Bulgaria number 9,000 out of a total population of17,000 _ some families have taken in as many as 40 immigrants.   Zulkar Ozturk, a 50-year-old retired bus driver, has 14 guests inhis three-room apartment. His retirement salary, equivalent to $110monthly, barely buys enough bread and potatoes for the group.   The exodus is expected to continue until Bulgaria closes theborder to protect its economy from labor shortages.   Turkey is demanding that Bulgaria agree to talks for animmigration agreement that would allow ethnic Turks to dispose oftheir property and get compensation for benefits such as accumulatedsocial security. So far, Turkey says, there has been no positiveresponse from Sofia.   Turkish officials believe the exodus will keep up until Bulgariacloses the border to protect its economy from labor shortages.   ``The moment the harm they are causing us is less than the harmthey are causing themselves economically, the border will beclosed,'' said a Foreign Ministry official on condition of anonymity.   Western diplomats and journalists say many towns and villageswhere ethnic Turks have lived are nearly empty and fields remainunharvested. Earlier this month Bulgaria issued a decree empoweringauthorities to conscript civilians to work in ``emergencies''threatening the economy.</TEXT></DOC>
