Price, director ofthe Health and Human Services Department's fiber-optic network project.andM;Once used sparingly as a conduit for thousands of simultaneous telephonecalls, fiber-optic cable now augments or replaces copper cable in high-speedcommunications around the block and around the world.andM;Price said HHS chose fiber-optic cable for its long-term, reliable andcost-effective data and video transmission.andM;&quot;Before, we would install hundreds of separate telephone company circuits tolink various local area networks, terminals to CPUs, and everything to thelocal node for our nationwide network,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;With the growth in our data transmission requirements, we needed a networklinking all the separate systems together.&quot;andM;The Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground Ballistic Research Laboratory also hasaccelerated its adoption of fiber.andM;&quot;New cables will hold single-frequency fibers that let us run longerdistances at higher data rates,&quot; predicted Terry Slattery, leader of thenetworking and systems development team.andM;&quot;With the new workstation processors running at speeds of 25 [million] to 50million instructions per second, we are finding that Ethernet local areanetworks become the limiting factor in large data transfers,&quot; Slattery said.andM;He anticipates that Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networks willreplace Ethernet, he said.andM;The Ballistic Research Laboratory now connects all its buildings with opticalfiber: 12 fibers for two buildings that are several kilometers from the maingroup, and up to 70 fibers between buildings in the main cluster.andP;  The fiberslie in telephone circuits, terminal concentrators, T1 network links for longlinks, and 10-megabit or 80-megabit token-ring networks.andM;Slattery said the laboratory chose fiber for interbuilding links because ofits high data rates over the distances involved and for its longevity in datacommunications.andM;&quot;We didn't see either baseband or broadband coaxial cable installationshaving as long a useful lifetime,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Because of the large number of fibers in each cable, we can put inexpensive,redundant electronics at the end points to reduce our susceptibility tosingle component failures.&quot;andM;HHS' Price said fiber products have advanced so much that installing opticalfiber now is no more difficult than installing copper cable.andP;  But hecautioned that installers must know the acceptable methods of handling fiber.andM;&quot;We installed fiber-optic media in the vertical risers of the HHSheadquarters building and are installing a network linking our four downtownbuildings,&quot; Price said.andP;  &quot;That will provide unlimited building backbone andcampuswide bandwidth for our current and future requirements.&quot;andM;Cost Is No ProblemandM;Slattery said maintaining a fiber cable plant is no more expensive orlaborious than maintaining a broadband cable plant.andM;&quot;Fiber cable connectors are not significantly more complex to install thangood-quality coaxial cable connectors,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;I've worked with excellent cable installers who had no training from anyvendor,&quot; said William Yurcik, a computer specialist at the Federal SystemsIntegration and Management Center.andP;  &quot;If you use commonsense rules and arefamiliar with cable installations, you can do a good job.&quot;andM;Connectors and cables available from telephone company suppliers make the jobeasier.andP;  The Ballistic Research Laboratory, for example, uses a 12-fiberribbon cable that enables splicing of all 12 fibers simultaneously instead ofeach one separately.andP;  Slattery said a 144-fiber cable can be spliced in aday.andM;Yurcik, formerly an engineer at the Naval Research Laboratory, said he workedon NRL's network.andM;&quot;We were interested in providing the best networking services for theresearchers there, and optical fiber gave them what they were looking for,&quot;he said.andM;the main reason was bandwidth.andP;  The Naval Research Laboratory wanted abackbone network to tie Ethernets throughout the laboratory as well ashigh-bandwidth, point-to-point connections for specific applications.andP;  Thehighest bandwidth requirement was for interactive graphics applicationsrunning on supercomputers.andM;Going the DistanceandM;Long-distance communications is another area where fiber optics is on therise.andP;  The Defense Department Continental United States Defense IntegratedNetwork leases fiber-optic cable services within this country and to Europeand plans to use fiber cable in other areas of the world as well.andM;&quot;In strategic locations such as Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Guam, we'reputting a mix of media on top of the Defense Satellite Communications Systemcommand and control system,&quot; said Defense Communications Agency multiplexmanager Fred Suarez.andM;&quot;If the satellites or their earth stations get knocked out, you still have analternate fiber path.&quot;andM;Suarez said analog copper cable service in the Pacific region carries only9,600 bits per second.andP;  In contrast, fiber-optic cable has digital bandwidthup into the gigabit-per-second range.andM;Future DOD needs for digital imagery and video teleconferencing will call forT1 (1.544 megabits per second) and multiple-T1 speeds.andM;&quot;Analog circuits can't do that,&quot; Suarez said.andP;  &quot;The only way you can satisfythose requirements today is via satellite, and that gets expensive.&quot;andM;Price said most organizations that take a long-term view of theircommunications needs are looking to fiber today.andM;&quot;A well-planned installation like our CampusNet can have a media life of 15years,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;that is very cost-effective compared with pulling andrepulling copper.&quot;andM;However, one of fiber's few drawbacks is that it mostly is a point-to-pointmedium, whereas copper cable can be tapped as necessary.andP;  &quot;That's whyEthernet is so popular,&quot; Yurcik said.andP;  &quot;It's easy to tap.&quot;andM;Suarez said DOD must continue to rely on satellite systems for service toplaces like Iceland where fiber links do not exist.andM;Long-haul or short-haul, fiber-optic cable most often works in combinationwith other transmission media.andP;  In satellite links, for instance, it helpsavoid &quot;double hopping,&quot; in which the signal must go up and down twice to getto the destination.andM;Mixed ApproachandM;The Ballistic Research Laboratory typifies the mixed-media approach to fiber.andO;Slattery said each building has at least one internal Ethernet for easynetwork access, but the buildings are connected by fiber cabling.andP;  Thelaboratory plans to add higher-performance routers and bridges.andM;&quot;It will not be long before processors will be available that drive FDDInetworks at full speed,&quot; Slattery said.andP;  &quot;And new network protocols are beingdesigned to implement the FDDI in hardware.andP;  They are pushing into thegigabit-per-second realm.&quot;andM;Slattery said the Ballistic Research Laboratory also may connect thecomputers within its computer rooms for robotic backup of large amounts ofdata.andP;  &quot;We are evaluating FDDI network components, alternative backup mediaand robotic backup systems,&quot; he said.andM;At HHS, a structured cabling plan involves a dual run of separately sheathed,four-pair unshielded twisted wire from each workstation to the closesttelephone wiring closet.andP;  The data runs connect to the building's backbonefiber-optic network, which connects to the CampusNet for routing to otherbuildings or to the nationwide HHS Departmental Information ManagementExchange System.andM;&quot;For building backbone and campus networks, fiber is the medium of choice,&quot;Price said.andP;  &quot;Those who install copper-based networks instead of fiber,waiting for the cost to come down, are only kidding themselves.&quot;andM;The reason, he said, is that installation costs will rise.andM;Short-Term FixandM;&quot;So what is being saved?&quot; Price said.andP;  &quot;You have restricted your users andwill have to go through the pain and agony of another installation within afew years.&quot;andM;Yurcik said he believes fiber-optic networking for the PC market will be amajor breakthrough.andM;&quot;Plastic-fiber optics probably will be the next step,&quot; he said.andM;But fiber-optic cable will be used with coaxial or twisted-pair cable for theforeseeable future.andM;&quot;Many manufacturers are just now coming out with interfaces for fiberoptics,&quot; he said.andM;In terms of ease of handling, Yurcik said, &quot;It's much easier to connect awork group with an Ethernet cable than with fiber in a star configuration.&quot;andM;But he observed that researchers all over the country are beginning to needhigher bandwidth, which is driving standardization efforts for fiber.andM;Slattery also said standards will drive the prices down on interfaces,routers and bridges.andM;&quot;After the remaining FDDI specifications get solidified, we expect to seevendors selling high-performance interface cards at reasonable costs,&quot; hesaid.andM;Slattery said the ballistics laboratory expects to have a prototype FDDInetwork in place by the end of fiscal 1990.andM;HHS is trying to follow the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profileand emerging FDDI standards, Price said.andM;&quot;We designed our CampusNet to be compliant with FDDI and we plan to implementthe standard in the future,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With the growth of data and imagetransmission in the next five years, we feel a high-speed backbone isessential for organizations to meet their missions.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
