Such an approach combined with themethod of partial solutions superposition for Laplas equation and iterationsto take into account the non-linear boundary condition at the perforatedbottom allow to provide an efficient and low computation time consumingtechnique for calculation of the velocity distribution near the perforatedbottom of the WWER type reactor shaft. With this the effects of turned-offreactor loops and pressure losses in the perforated bottom can be takeninto consideration as well. The experiments with a plane hydrodynamicreactor model have proved the validity of the mentioned assumptions.6 refs.; 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
