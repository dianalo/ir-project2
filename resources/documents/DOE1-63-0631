<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-63-0631 </DOCNO><TEXT>The arc heat source has been shown to have a strong influence on the characteristicsof the molten weld pool and resulting weld bead morphology. The existenceof nonequilibrium temperature distribution between arc species and thepresence of metallic vapor in the arc plasma above the anode have beensuggested to have an influence on the current distribution. These twoinfluences have been investigated. A multi-fluid treatment of the arcto discern the impact on the anode current distribution and transportproperties by nonequilibrium temperature distribution between electronsand heavy species in the welding arc suggests that nonequilibrium hasa pronounced influence on the transport properties. However, the resultinganode current distribution is only slightly perturbed. Results suggestthat nonequilibrium between species in the interfacial region of thearc above the anode produces only a second-order influence on the anodecurrent distribution. The presence of small amounts (5-10%) of manganesecan significantly enhance the low temperature conductivity of the plasma.This results in broadening of the anode current distribution relativeto that found when only argon is present in the arc. Attemps to developoptical and laser diagnostics for the interfacial region above the anodeare reported. Results suggest that laser induced fluorescence has considerablemerit for determining species distributions in the arc and possibly inthe interfacial region. 29 refs., 23 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
