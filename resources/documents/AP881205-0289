(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The commercial banking industry easilycould become obsolete without serious legislative reform, thepresident of the American Bankers Association warned Monday.   ``The future isn't all that bright,'' said Thomas P. Rideout,also vice chairman of the First Union National Bank of NorthCarolina in Charlotte, at the Oregon Bankers Association's annualwinter conference.   From 1977 to 1987, he said, banking's share of financial assetsheld by financial institutions dropped from 37 percent to 29 percent.   In the same period, large banks' share of credit extended tononfinancial corporations fell from 62 percent to 44 percent, hesaid. Credit-market debt held by banks for the same period alsodropped, from 41 percent to 35 percent.   Deposit growth among competitors during the period far outpacedthe 117 percent growth experienced by commercial banks, with savingsand loan deposits up 139 percent, life insurance reserves up 191percent, liabilities and capital of securities brokers and dealersup 1,042 percent, and money market mutual funds up 6,450 percent,Rideout said.   Technology has permitted easy entry into the financial servicesbusiness by institutions outside the traditional banking industry,he said, and their services are expanding.   ``Competitors are being allowed to engage in banking withoutmeeting the supervisory standards imposed on banks, or our samestrict capital requirements, which in fact are getting stricter aswe head toward 1992,'' Rideout said. ``Lax standards, of course, areone of the main causes behind the FSLIC (Federal Savings andamp; LoanInsurance Corp.) crisis today.''   Bank failures have risen, he said, from 42 in 1982 to 184 in 1987and 175 through October of this year. The number of institutionsidentified as ``problem banks'' has risen from 300 in 1982 to 1,575in 1987 and 1,495 through May of this year.   Rideout said association members should target legislators topush for reforming antiquated banking laws _ particularly thosecovering deposit insurance.</TEXT></DOC>
