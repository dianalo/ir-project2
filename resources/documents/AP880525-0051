HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Doctors reported finding the first tentativeevidence that chemotherapy may be able to help control lung cancer,the nation's leading cancer killer.   Four studies presented at a medical conference produce at leasta hint that platinum-based drugs, combined with radiation andsometimes surgery, may help prolong patients' survival.   None of the research suggests anything close to a cure for lungcancer, but doctors are encouraged by any improvement in a diseasein which survival is measured in months, rather than years.   ``There is no effective therapy for the vast majority ofpatients,'' said Dr. Robert Capizzi of Wake Forest University inWinston-Salem, N.C.   He said this makes the latest research, presented Tuesday at theannual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,potentially important.   ``There is the possibility that drugs may, for some subset ofpatients, have important effects,'' he said. ``We don't have aprescription to be offered to the masses. We have important newleads for controlled clinical trials.''   About 150,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year.The four studies were conducted on people with non-small cell lungcancer, which accounts for about three-quarters of all cases.   The most encouraging results were presented by Dr. Robert O.Dillman of the Scripps Clinic of San Diego.   Like the other studies, his was conducted on people whose cancerwas too extensive to be removed surgically but had not spreadbeyond the chest. Typically, such people are treated withradiation, which slows but does not stop the disease.   He treated 240 patients with radiation and chemotherapy or withradiation alone.   He estimated that half of the patients receiving the combinationwould still be alive after one year, compared with one-third ofthose who got only radiation.   ``Our study is the first to show that chemotherapy may help atall in non-small cell lung cancer,'' Dillman said.   While the treatment may represent an advance, he said, ``this isnot going to be enough. More clinical trials will be needed toimprove survival in this disease.''   Dr. Roscoe Morton the North Central Cancer Treatment Group inRochester, Minn., conducted a similar study using differentchemotherapy drugs. However, in this attempt, the drugs did nothelp people live longer.   ``We were not able to influence the outcomes by chemotherapy inaddition to radiation,'' he said.   The other studies used chemotherapy plus radiation to shrinktumors so they could be removed surgically.   In one, directed by Dr. Gary M. Strauss of St. Vincent Hospitalin Worcester, Mass., doctors were able to completely remove tumorsfrom 10 of 41 patients treated.   He said the patients' median survival is 17 months, and ``thereis a suggestion that this approach might be associated with longersurvival.''   A smiliar study was conducted by Dr. Paul L. Weiden andcolleagues at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle on 69patients. He said there was no clear evidence that patients theredid better.   ``The median survival of all patients is about 11 months, whichis comparable to what would happen with radiation alone,'' Weidensaid. ``We don't have evidence that all patients would benefit bythis treatment. It would appear to be a start to trying to improvethe treatment.''</TEXT></DOC>
