Patricia Munday, 39, is being treated under police guard at aCalcutta hospital for injuries sustained when she was attacked byvillagers in Purulia, near Calcutta.   Ms. Munday, who was part of a United Nations team that won the1981 Nobel Peace Prize, is being held for links with a mysteriousHindu cult called the Ananda Marg, or the Path of Bliss, which isbased in the Purulia district.   Membership in the cult is not a criminal offense, but police aredeeply suspicious of the order, claiming it practices black magic.Ms. Munday has not been charged.   The Supreme Court order said Ms. Munday, who is from Waitsfield,Vt., could see friends and attorneys, but a policeman would bepresent during the meetings, according to the Press Trust of India.   Arguments on the legality of her detention have been set forMarch 16.   In Calcutta, a prominent politican who unsuccessfully attemptedto visit Ms. Munday on Thursday called her detention ``inhuman anduncivilized.''   Mamta Banerjee, a member of the opposition Congress Party, saidWest Bengal state officials ``cried themselves hoarse for NelsonMandela. But what are they doing to this helpless foreign lady? Shewill go mad in this condition.''   Miss Banerjee, who said she visited the Belle Vue Nursing Homein an attempt to meet Ms. Munday, said she saw the American womanbriefly before police pushed Miss Banerjee away from the door ofthe hospital room.   ``I raised my voice and told her that I would like to offer anyhelp that she might need,'' Miss Banerjee said. ``She thanked me.''   West Bengal state, of which Calcutta is the capital, is ruled bythe Communist Party of India-Marxist, which in the past has oftenclashed with followers of Ananda Marg.   Ms. Munday, who was a member of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees team that won the Nobel Peace Prize forits work in Somalia, arrived in India from Nepal on a private visit.   Villagers attacked her and a female companion when they weretraveling in the Purulia district on Jan. 26. Ms. Munday suffered agash on her forehead and was arrested when she tried to lodge acomplaint about the attack.   Ananda Marg is a secretive cult which claims to have branchesaround the world. Little information about the group's activitiesis available because members are bound by an oath of secrecy.Indian newspapers have said the group uses skulls and daggers inits ritualistic dances.   The group says it wants to create a social, economic andspiritual order that will replace both capitalism and communism andrid society of sectarianism and parochialism.</TEXT></DOC>
