<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-1053 </DOCNO><TEXT>The coexistence of chemical potential gradients of solute species in ahydrothermal solution, and a temperature gradient imposed by a heat sourcemay lead to complex coupled transport of matter and heat. If the geologicalmaterial is permeable to solutes, thermal diffusion (Soret effect) mayconstitute an important transport mechanism that could redistribute ionicspecies in the fluid phase. An attempt is made to explain, by stabilitytheory, the non-steady-state behaviour of the system and the temperatureoscillations within a thin convective layer adjacent to the walls ofthe heat source.</TEXT></DOC>
