The major policy shift represented an effort to attract otheropposition parties to a coalition with the Socialists, Japan'slargest opposition party.   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the Socialists, also saidhis party won't seek any drastic changes in the country's capitalisteconomic policies.   He said the Socialists would accept the existence ``for the timebeing'' of Japan's Self Defense Forces but would continue toadvocate peace and disarmament.   He said the party would seek only a gradual reduction of U.S.bases in Japan, where 64,000 U.S. troops are stationed.   Yamaguchi told party regional officials the policy changes wereaimed at creating an alliance with other opposition groups, whichhave criticized the party's past platform as unrealistic.   Ms. Doi said she had met with leaders of three othernon-communist opposition parties and they had agreed to worktogether while respecting each other's policies.   The parties _ the Buddhist-affiliated Clean Government Party, theDemocratic Socialist Party and the United Social Democratic Party _are unified in their opposition to an unpopular new sales tax thatthe Liberal Democrats pushed through parliament. However, theydisagree on a range of other issues, including nuclear power andrelations with North Korea and South Korea.   Until Monday, the Socialists had opposed the mutual securitytreaty with the United States and the Self Defense Forces, whichthey said violated a constitutional ban on maintenance of land, seaand air forces. Japanese courts have interpreted the constitution asallowing defensive military forces.   Under the moderate leadership of Chairwoman Takako Doi, theSocialists emerged the biggest winner last month in elections forparliament's upper house.   Opposition parties now hold a majority of seats in the upperchamber and hope to eliminate the governing Liberal DemocraticParty's majority in the lower house in general elections that mustbe held by July.   Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the conservative governing party'sPolicy Affairs Research Council, said his party would transfer powerto the opposition rather than seek a coalition government if itloses its majority in the lower chamber.   The Socialists could lead their own coalition government if aunified opposition captures a majority of seats in the lower house.   Yamaguchi called on his party Monday to shift its focus fromcriticizing the Liberal Democrats, who have led Japan for 34 years,to creating positive policy alternatives.   He said the party's new policies also call for tighter civiliancontrol of the military and a return to a ceiling on defense outlaysof 1 percent of Japan's gross national product.   The Japanese government scrapped the self-imposed limit in 1987following U.S. pressure to spend more on defense.   Yamaguchi said Japan should maintain its close U.S. relations,but that the ties should be based on equality and mutual benefit andbe balanced with good relations with other nations.   Opponents of the U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty have chargedthat an alliance with the United States could hurt relations withother nations and drag Japan into a nuclear war.</TEXT></DOC>
