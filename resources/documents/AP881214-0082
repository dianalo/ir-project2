The U.N. agency's director, James Ingram, said this year may beremembered ``as the year of disasters.''   ``Never before in WFP's history did we have to respond to so manysudden calamities, primarily hurricanes and typhoons but alsodevastating floods in all parts of the world,'' he said.   The agency said the amount of emergency food aid delivered topeople in 1988 is expected to surpass the 820,000 tons delivered in1987, the largest amount previously provided in its 25-year history.   It said major operations in 1988 centered on large numbers ofrefugees and displaced people in Pakistan, Iran, Malawi, Somalia andEthiopia.   The agency said its assistance in 1988 reached 8.5 million of theworld's estimated 13 million refugees.   The statistics do not include assistance to victims of the Dec. 7earthquake in Soviet Armenia.   Program officials also said they do not expect the demand foremergency food aid to decline in 1989.   Food pledged for 1989 already has been committed to the agency'scontinuing emergency situations, it said.   ``This past year has strained the program's resources to thelimit and the forecast for 1989 is bleak,'' Ingram said. ``Donorgovernments must now realize the urgency of the situation andrespond with food pledges.''</TEXT></DOC>
