The experimental set-up is described, and the methodsapplied are presented. The measurements were made on a horizontal copperheating tube whose surface was treated with abrasive papers of differentroughness. The influence of boiling pressure and heat flux density arediscussed as well. The size distribution of active bubble nucleationsites is investigated using the author's model and other models. Thesize distribution and profile depths are determined from surface profilesand compared with the size distributions of the active bubble nucleationsites. (HAG).</TEXT></DOC>
