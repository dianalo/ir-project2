These testobjects have arisen as a result of involvement in both the laboratoryevaluation of radiological imaging systems and the routine maintenanceof such equipment in a large diagnostic radiology department. The philosophybehind the design and application of the test objects is briefly described.Particular attention is paid to the advantages of using the threshold-contrastdetail-detectability technique to assess overall imaging performance.The great importance of ensuring optimum imaging performance prior toclinical acceptance is stressed. A strategy for implementing the testobjects in a clinical department is present. The diagnostic informationcontent of the clinical images which result measures the success of thequality control procedure adopted.</TEXT></DOC>
