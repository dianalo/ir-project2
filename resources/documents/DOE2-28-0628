The concentrationof asbestos fibers in bronchoalveolar lavage was significantly higherin the groups of people currently and formerly occupationally exposed,compared to the concentration found in people only exposed environmentally,despite wide interindividual variation within the groups. Nonasbestosinorganic fibers were present in all groups, but the concentrations didnot differ significantly. Both in people occupationally exposed and inthose only environmentally exposed, the alveolar load consisted mainlyof ultrashort and ultrathin fibers, which can be studied only with TEM.In fact, the percentage of fibers greater than 5 micron long was onlyaround 15% in the occupationally exposed and was minimal in those onlyenvironmentally exposed. The geometric mean diameters of asbestos fibersretained in the alveoli ranged from 0.05 micron for chrysotile to 0.15micron for amphiboles.</TEXT></DOC>
