Gary Hart formally launched his second drive for the presidency and pledged a campaign to &quot;recapture a sense of the national interest.&quot;    Mr. Hart's brief statement in this tiny mountain community of 450 people yesterday underscored both his unconventional political style and his intention to portray the 1988 presidential election as &quot;nothing less than a referendum on America's future.&quot;    Earlier entrants into the 1988 presidential race have luxuriated in what former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, another Democratic contestant, called the &quot;ritual of announcing for president.&quot; But Mr. Hart's sparse comments here -- he drove his own white Jeep to the announcement site in Red Rocks Park -- highlighted his unwillingness to conform to prevailing political style. At the same time, his appearance without a topcoat in a cold and damp mountain setting reinforced both his status as a front-runner and his image as a political loner from the West.    His statement, made without a text, was concise but personal, more thematic than specific, and sharply critical of the Reagan administration and of traditional politics.    &quot;We've let personal greed replace a sense of social justice and equity and the national good,&quot; he said. &quot;We've let right-wing ideology skew this nation's basic priorities. We've increasingly let narrow single-interests finance our campaigns and control our political process.&quot;    Then, in language reminiscent of his 1984 campaign, when he portrayed himself as the candidate of the future and a rebel against the established totems of politics, he said that in the 1988 presidential campaign Americans are &quot;going to select not only a leader, we are going to select a future.&quot;    That idiom helped transform Mr. Hart from the back ranks of the 1984 challengers into a serious force that nearly prevailed in the primaries and caucuses and, combined with the landslide victory of President Reagan, succeeded in pressing the Democratic Party to undergo a serious self-evaluation.    Now Mr. Hart, more comfortable as an outsider than as an established political figure, is the clear leader in the Democratic polls and, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, ahead of both leading Republican candidates, Vice President George Bush and Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas.    Mr. Hart, however, faces many threats along the road to the Atlanta convention in July 1988, including the possibility that one of the growing number of other contestants will ambush him in much the same way he did to former Vice President Walter Mondale. A Boston Globe poll of New Hampshire Democrats taken late last month showed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis with a three-point lead over Mr. Hart in the state that holds the first presidential primary.    In his appearance here yesterday and at a snowy downtown rally in Denver's Skyline Park, Mr. Hart said he hoped to help the nation &quot;lead the knowledge revolution and unleash the dynamo of democracy world-wide.&quot;    He stressed improvements in the educational system, revitalization of U.S. industry, a &quot;solemn and moral pledge&quot; to clean up the environment, efforts to bolster U.S. conventional forces and decrease the emphasis on nuclear weapons, and a commitment to serve &quot;the genuine human needs&quot; of the elderly and poor at home.    &quot;In helping a new world to be born,&quot; he said, &quot;we must be neither bellicose nor protectionist nor isolationist.&quot;    The formal announcement by Mr. Hart, who left the Senate after two terms last January, followed a series of speeches on foreign-policy, education, civil-rights and trade issues and the publication of a book on military reform. Meanwhile, he has reduced his debt from the 1984 campaign from $4.7 million to $1.3 million and has begun to raise money for the new campaign; he raised $400,000 for the 1988 race at a Denver fund-raiser Sunday night.    Following his announcement activities here, Mr. Hart was scheduled to depart today for Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses, and then to Texas, Pennsylvania and California, with the emphasis at each stop on the need to fashion new strategies for the future.    &quot;Governing is what this election is all about,&quot; he said. &quot;Traditional politics must take second place in 1988.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
