He said he was sure the summit will be secure at the site ata well-fortified installation cut off from the Colombian mainlandexcept for one entrance.   ``I'm not going to do something stupid or macho,'' Bush told theCommonwealth Club.   He added, laughing, that he loves the switch in his image.``This guy they used to call timid is now macho man,'' he said.   Bush will fly to Colombia and spend several hours at the summitin Cartagena on Feb. 15 with Colombian President Virgilio Barco andofficials of Bolivia and Peru.   He said it was important that he do nothing that might even``inadvertantly'' signal to Barco that he should cut a deal withhis country's drug cartels.   ``I think we've got good arrangements and I think it is good,sound anti-narcotics policy to support President Barco, who isdoing an awful lot to protect our kids from the scourge ofnarcotics,'' he said.   Bush also drew applause from the crowd of more than 2,500 whenhe said, ``We've condoned things in this country that we shouldhave condemned long ago in terms of narcotics.''   Among those joining in the applause was former Secretary ofState George P. Shultz, seated at Bush's right. Shultz created astir last fall when he called for legalizing illicit drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
