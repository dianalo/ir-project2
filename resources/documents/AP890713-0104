It will dolittle to remind the nation of the serious wrongs of the Iran-Contraaffair or to deter other gung-ho government officials from breakingthe law in the name of ``following orders.''   The mild sentence is also a break for President Bush. It willboth reduce right-wing pressure for a North pardon and furthereclipse bids to find out what role Bush really had in theIran-Contra dealings. He can continue stonewalling.   Few felt the former National Security Council aide should havegotten the 10-year maximum sentence, but some time in custody wouldhave dramatized the seriousness of this affair.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 6   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal, on North's sentence:   Oliver North may never understand, jingoists lack the ability tounderstand, but U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell showed heunderstood when he sentenced North Wednesday for his role in theIran-Contra affair. ...   Gesell's sentence was just. North was a small fry caught in a netdesigned to let larger fish go free. Putting North in prison wouldnot be wise. He poses no physical threat to others.   Unless he is returned to a position of public trust, he isunlikely to repeat his offenses. And North would not gainunderstanding through imprisonment. He may gain understanding byworking with vulnerable youths trapped in a more important war thanthe one North thought he was waging in Nicaragua _ the war to savesouls from the scourge of drugs.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 7   The Bellingham (Wash.) Herald, on North's sentence:   Instead of throwing the book at Oliver North, U.S. District CourtJudge Gerhard Gesell threw a handful of the pages and expressed thehope that North, and the rest of the country, would get the message.   That message is that North deserved punishment for misusing hispower as a National Security Council employee during the Iran-Contraarms-for-hostages dealing, but that the punishment should fit notonly the crime but the criminal.   Some observers believe North got off with a wrist-slap, andshould have done time in prison. Others, supporting North, believe a$150,000 fine and a ban from holding public office is a high priceto have to pay for merely following orders. ...   We probably all lack ``full understanding'' of the case, eventhough it was widely reported. Left undocumented, for example, wasthe extent of President Reagan's role in the illegal activities. Butone thing Gesell seemed to understand fully was that jailing Northwould have achieved little more than making him an unjustifiedmartyr.   Future Iran-Contra trials will help us understand more about thecase and North's role in it. Until then, the judge has relegated himto minor-player status, which is probably where history will keephim.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 8   San Luis Obispo County (Calif.) Telegram-Tribune, on North'ssentence:   Oliver North has been spared going to jail. The fact remainsthere was ample justification for putting him behind bars.   Given his heroic war record and his bristling performance as asuper-patriot before, during and after his trial, the former Marinecolonel whipped up widespread sentiment against his going to prison.   But it can be persuasively argued, it seems to us, that thepenalties imposed by Judge Gerhard Gesell were hardly commensuratewith the gravity of his crimes _ fraud, lying to Congress anddestruction of government documents ...   At the same time _ and this no doubt was central to the judge'sdeterminations _ he held that North was ``not ... a leader at all''in the Iran-Contra scandal but ``really a low-ranking subordinateworking to carry out initiatives of a few cynical superiors.''   Gesell obviously was referring to the late CIA director WilliamCasey and John Poindexter and Robert MacFarlane, both formernational security directors.   Much of the American public also believes that Ronald Reagan,then president, was the most culpable superior ...   His (North's) diehard supporters also are clamoring for a pardon.President Bush, whose role in Iran-Contra also begs for furtherexamination, would be well advised to ignore such sentiment lest afresh firestorm of bitter debate sweep the country.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
