They said the development may make it easier to develop anunderstanding of how the brain works, and could ultimatelylead to electronic systems with some of the same capabilitiesas a biological nervous system.</LP><TEXT>   Until now, attempts to model brain activity have centeredon complex software programs that, in essence, createimaginary networks of brain cells based on the latest theoryof how these cells work. These attempts have met with somesuccess: A major software effort at International BusinessMachines Corp., for example, last year surprised even itsinventors by spontaneously producing the computerizedequivalent of &quot;brain waves.&quot;   But such progress, which has been slow, eats up hugeamounts of computer time. In the IBM experiment, severalhours on a high-powered mainframe computer were required tosimulate a few seconds of activity in a small section of aguinea pig's brain. By contrast, a hardware-based approachmight allow faster development of knowledge, since largenumbers of electronic devices can be hooked together so thatthey operate in &quot;real time.&quot;   In their report, which appears in today's edition ofNature, a weekly U.K. science magazine, the two scientistsstressed that their device is radically different fromexisting electronic components used in &quot;neural-network&quot;computers, which are often cited as producing brainlikeresults such as pattern recognition. Such electroniccomponents are always switched either on or off, generating astaccato computer language of ones and zeros.   The new device, on the other hand, speaks the samevariable language as human nerve cells, sending electricalsignals that can fade or grow stronger. Measured with thesame testing methods used to monitor human nerve cells, thedevice's response was &quot;essentially the same,&quot; reported thescientists, Rodney Douglas of Oxford University and MishaMahowald of the California Institute of Technology.   It isn't yet clear that such behavior would be more usefulin modelling brain structure than the on-off world ofconventional computer components -- or even than slowsoftware-based approaches. At Nestor Inc., a neural-networkcompany based in Providence, R.I., co-founder Leon Coopersays the work of Drs. Douglas and Mahowald sounds veryinteresting, but that other hardware and software approachesare becoming mature, and he feels they might bear fruitearlier.   Nonetheless, in a commentary that also appears in today'sNature, computer scientist Andreas Andreou of Johns HopkinsUniversity says the new &quot;silicon neuron&quot; could emerge as &quot;thetechnology of choice for modelling the nervous system.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
