Lynch, as the agency's top enforcement officer since 1985, wasthe prime mover behind the commission's biggest cases in recentyears, including the settlements with stock speculator Ivan Boeskyand Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Lynch had joined the commission as a staff attorney in 1976, ayear after graduating from Duke University Law School. Lynch, in aninterview, said he had no specific plans after leaving the SEC.   ``I've been director for over four years. It just got to thepoint where it seemed like it was the appropriate time to move onto something new,'' he said.   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, in a statement, said, ``DuringGary's tenure ... the commission has undertaken major programs tocombat securities fraud. ... The culmination of Gary's verysuccessful career ... is, of course, the historic settlement ...between Drexel Burnham Lambert and the commission.''   That settlement of civil charges, announced last month, capped atwo-year investigation that began when Boesky implicated thenation's fifth-largest securities firm. He settled insider tradingcharges with the SEC in 1986.   The Drexel civil settlement helped pave the way for Drexel tosettle a criminal complaint and pay a record $650 million in finesand restitution.   The insider trading scandal uncovered during Lynch's tenureforced venerable brokerage houses to re-evaluate their complianceand ethics codes and led Congress to increase the penalties forinsider trading.   ``I think we went an awful long way to cleaning up some seriousproblems that existed,'' Lynch said. `` ... There's more concernnow about the possibility of being the subject of an SECenforcement action. In addition, probably more importantly, as aresult of the abuses that were exposed, brokerage firms have becomemore alert to possible problems within their own organizations thatcan lead to near disaster and ruin.''   Lynch is credited with personally piercing the veil of secrecysurrounding the Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank, where convictedinside trader Dennis Levine maintained an account. It was Levinewhose cooperation with the SEC led to Boesky, who in turnimplicated Drexel in the largest securities fraud case ever broughtby the government.   Lynch took over the SEC's top cop job at a time of turmoil forthe agency and is credited with restoring morale. His predecessor,John Fedders, departed amid charges he had beaten his wife. Now 38years old, Lynch was the youngest enforcement director in theagency's history.   As a government employee, Lynch earned an annual salary of about$72,000, far less than he could earn in private practice. However,he said neither the salary nor the long hours he worked played amajor role in his decision to leave.</TEXT></DOC>
