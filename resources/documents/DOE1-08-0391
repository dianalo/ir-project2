A detailed analysis of the feasibilityof using smaller buses is shown using the example of a study undertakenfor CITRAN, the City Transit Service of Fort Worth, Texas. Benefits ascribedto smaller buses include better economy on a vehicle-mile basis, a lowerinitial purchase price, and a better public image of cost efficiencyfor the property. Detriments include costs associated with training ofdrivers and mechanics, increased complexity of operations, increasedspace for parts, and maintenance of dual inventories of other items.When costs are compared, it is economical to switch to smaller busesonly for a large property's low-demand routes.</TEXT></DOC>
