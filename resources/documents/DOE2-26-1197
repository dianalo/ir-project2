This fact madethe authors to revise the theory of flute instability, where pressurewas proposed to be constant on surfaces of equal specific volume. Magnetohydrodynamicequations for flute oscillations in curved magnetic field were used toshow, that a new type of instability with inconstant pressure on surfacesof equal specific volume is possible in a plasma layer of magnetosphere.The expression for instability increment was obtained. It follows fromequation analysis, that disturbances, short-wave with respect to theion Larmor radius, are stable due to magnetodrift effects. Incrementsof flute instability are calculated both for the case of arbitrary configurationof magnetic field and for configuration of the dipole magnetic field.Increments are evaluated with the use of characteristic parameters ofthe Earth plasma layer.</TEXT></DOC>
