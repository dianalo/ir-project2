(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The founders of Hewlett-Packard Co.,the $10 billion computer and electronics giant, returned after 50years to the garage where they started out for the dedication ofthe building as a state landmark.   It was in the wooden garage that William R. Hewlett and DavidPackard in 1938 parlayed $538 in capital and an audio oscillatorinto one of the world's leading electronics companies.   Their company, which employs 87,000 people, is has headquartersa couple of miles away in Palo Alto.   But after poking around the dark and dingy interior during thededication Friday, Hewlett and Packard said they did not accept itsbilling as ``birthplace of Silicon Valley,'' and were not eager toreminisce. A plaque is to be set in a sandstone rock in front ofthe garage to mark its landmark status.   Packard, asked how did it felt to return after half a century,said:   ``It makes me feel pretty old and decrepit.''   ``I feel the same way,'' said Hewlett.   Although both are billionaires, neither has thought about buyingthe property at 367 Addison Ave., which has become a favorite photostop for touring Japanese electronics groups and young Stanfordengineers.   ``Why would we?'' Hewlett said. ``It's a bunch of junk.''   Packard said it was the first time they'd been back to thegarage since 1939. Packard and his wife rented the 1905-vintagewood-shingle house in front and Hewlett rented a cottage out back.   Hewlett, who is 76 today, and Packard, 76, have long retiredfrom daily management of the company, though they remain itslargest shareholders. Hewlett resigned as vice chairman of theboard in 1987; Packard remains chairman.   Hewlett-Packard's success spurred the growth of the regionaround Stanford University that became known as Silicon Valley. Thearea got its name from the silicon wafers used to make mostcomputer chips or semiconductors.   Hewlett said he doesn't think the garage should be called thebirthplace of the valley.   ``We had practically nothing to do with silicon and we weren'tthe first (company) in the valley,'' he said.   About half a dozen electrical products companies were in the SanFrancisco Bay area in 1938, Hewlett said, including a vacuum tubefactory in nearby Redwood City run by Charles Litton. His companylater became Litton Industries, a huge manufacturer of high-techappliances.   A few hundred Hewlett-Packard employees threw a street partyoutside the garage, complete with balloons, a brass band and foodkiosks, but neither of the founders seemed excited about thelandmark designation.   ``The only trouble is, you can't tear it down now,'' Hewlettsaid.   ``I'm not very strong on reminiscing,'' said Packard. ``I thinkwe ought to be looking forward instead of backward.''   The audio oscillator that the two started out with was a $79.50model of a $400 machine sold by another company in the 1930s. Theoscillator emits various frequencies, allowing the testing of soundequipment, telephones, amplifiers and talking pictures. Walt Disneybought eight Hewlett-Packard oscillators to help make the movie``Fantasia.''   Packard couldn't remember how much rent he paid for the houseand garage, but guessed it probably was less than $25 a month. Thehouse, in what has become an upscale neighborhood, now rents for$1,650.</TEXT></DOC>
