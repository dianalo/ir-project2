Aerospace industry sources said St. Louis-based McDonnell has been discussing a new aircraft design, known as the &quot;stretch MD-80,&quot; with various customers. The longer-bodied aircraft would be powered by the V-2500, a new engine built by a multinational consortium.    The project could give a boost to McDonnell's commercial jetliner unit, which has lost business to Boeing because it offers only short-range and long-range planes. But should McDonnell go ahead with plans to develop the medium-range model, it wouldn't be the only company to try for a piece of the 757's booming market. Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, has for several months been talking about a &quot;stretched&quot; version of its 150-seat A-320, which is also available powered by the V-2500.    Until the two smaller concerns get their designs off the ground, the Boeing plane will continue to enjoy its monopoly position. The world's largest builder of commercial jets has sold 371 of the model 757, including 132 jetliners so far this year. Many airlines, including United Airlines, a unit of of UAL Corp. and American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., have been ordering the 186-seat planes to replace smaller models, such as the McDonnell MD-80, which seats 142 passengers. The stretched version of the MD-80 would be slightly smaller than the Boeing model, seating about 170 passenges in a mixed-class arrangement.    In an interview, James Worsham, president of McDonnell's Douglas Aircraft Co. unit, cautioned that the company &quot;is still studying a possible version of the MD-80. It doesn't even have a name yet, and we don't even know for sure if we're interested in doing it.&quot; A decision could be at least several months away, he indicated. Should McDonnell decide to develop the plane, it would be marketed largely to airlines that already fly the MD-80 because the new version could be flown by a flight crew trained on the smaller plane and would use similar spare parts.    Mr. Worsham said McDonnell had talked to airlines and International Aero Engines, the consortium that makes the V-2500, whose partners include United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit and Rolls-Royce PLC. Aerospace industry executives close to International Lease Finance Corp., said the aircraft lessor based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is interested in acquiring as many as 100 of the stretched model, if McDonnell gives the project the green light. A spokesman for the leasing company declined to comment.    Should McDonnell approve the program, Mr. Worsham said, the company might have to abandon its efforts to sell two other versions of the MD-80 powered by a fuel-efficient &quot;propfan&quot; engine, which combines properties of jets and propellors. The so-called MD-90 series hasn't received any orders from airlines or leasing companies, and a competing propfan-powered aircraft from Boeing has been delayed indefinitely for lack of customer interest.    &quot;We probably would not do both&quot; the propfan and the stretched MD-80, Mr. Worsham said. &quot;We have a resource problem: money, people, capacity. We have to make sure that we don't bite off more than we can chew.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
