The partnership would be a potentially profit-making organizationthat would work with the federal government on research leading tothe manufacture of high-definition TV sets, the American ElectronicsAssociation said Thursday.   The partnership might even do its own manufacturing ofcomponents, such as picture tubes, spokesman John Hatch said.   The trade group argues that the United States cannot afford to beleft behind by the Japanese in the next generation of bright, sharptelevisions, which will be packed with sophisticated electronics.   ``Given the unlikelihood of an individual U.S. company riskingentering this evolving new market, the action is a logical andpractical next step for the industry,'' Pat Hill Hubbard, thegroup's vice president for science and technology policy, said in astatement.   Some analysts have expressed skepticism about the potential forsuccess of such a partnership, and some of the companies that agreedto do the feasibility study said they were not necessarily committedto participating in a partnership.   John Taylor, a spokesman for Zenith Electronics Corp., the lastmajor U.S. television manufacturer, said, ``In terms of overallsupport, we rate this as third or fourth in importance.''   Acknowledging the obstacles, Ms. Hubbard said in an interview,``There's not been a soul who's encouraged me personally or AEA ingeneral on doing this. There's been nothing but nay-sayers.''   Asked if she was optimistic about the chances for a partnership,she said, ``Optimistic is too elevated a word. This is a logicalnext step.''   Companies funding development of a business plan for the proposedventure are Hewlett-Packard Co., Varian Associates, Cohu Inc.,Digital Equipment Corp., ITT Corp., Prometrix Corp., PCO Inc.,Zenith, International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc.,Tektronix Inc., Raychem Corp., Motorola Inc., Texas InstrumentsInc., Harris Corp. and AVX Corp.   Also participating is MCC, the Austin, Texas-based researchconsortium formerly known as Microelectronics and ComputerTechnology Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
