LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Israeli Supreme Court on Sunday temporarilyblocked the deportation of an Arab-American advocate of civildisobedience and gave the government three days to explain itsexpulsion order.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, protests erupted over army ordersthat 300,000 Palestinians obtain new identity cards.   An Israeli Cabinet member called for legislation limiting thedefense minister's powers to order military actions. The move cameafter last week's Israeli incursion into Lebanon in which threeIsraeli soldiers died.   Supreme Court Justice Shoshana Netanyahu delayed for three daysthe deportation order against Mubarak Awad, who filed his appealSunday. He was to have been deported at midnight.   Ms. Netanyahu ordered the government to explain its order andalso scheduled a hearing Monday on a request that Awad be releasedfrom jail, court spokesman Shmaryahu Cohen said.   Awad has been on a hunger strike since his arrest Thursday. In astatement, he said he was defending ``the right of allJerusalemites to continue to live peacefully in their homelandregardless of their opinions.''   ``For Prime Minister (Yitzhak) Shamir to say that I, aChristian, will be forever prevented from returning to my city ofJerusalem to pray in my holy places is totally unacceptable,'' hesaid.   Awad's wife, Nancy Nye, read the statement to reporters.   Israel radio said Secretary of State George P. Shultz sentShamir a personal message protesting the deportation order againstAwad, a proponent of non-violent resistance to Israel's 21-yearoccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment on thereport, and a spokesman for Shamir said the prime minister had notreceived Shultz's message.   The Israeli government has accused Awad, 44, of incitingviolence during the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising in theoccupied territories. By U.N. count, 184 Palestinians and twoIsraelis have been killed since the violence began Dec. 8.   On Friday, after issuing the deportation order, the governmentalleged Awad helped prepare leaflets urging youths to throwfirebombs and stones.   Jonathan Kuttab, a lawyer for Awad, said the appeal was basedprimarily on ``the inherent right of Jerusalemites, PalestinianArabs, to continue to reside in (Arab) east Jerusalem.''   The Jerusalem-born Awad left for the United States in 1968 andreturned in 1985 to found the Palestinian Center for the Study ofNon-Violence.   The government refused to renew his Israeli-issued residencepermit last August. In November, the government also rejected hisplea for the renewal of a tourist visa.   Israel radio said the Palestine Liberation Organization haspressured Awad not to appeal the deportation because such a movewould imply acceptance of Israeli rule.   When asked about the report, Kuttab said only that the existenceof differing opinions in the Palestinian community was well known.   Demonstrations broke out in at least six towns and refugee campsin the Gaza Strip against military orders that residents apply fornew ID cards.   The military has seized cards to force residents to pay backtaxes, utility bills and other government fees. Non-payment oftaxes and other fees is a major tactic in the uprising.   Palestinians in the occupied territories are required to carrythe cards at all times. They are frequently stopped by soldiers andasked to show them and are subject to arrest if caught without acard.   In the Beach refugee camp, police fired tear gas and rubberbullets to disperse protesters. At least 23 people were treated atthe camp's U.N. clinic and nearby Al Shifa hospital for injuriesand the effects of tear gas, doctors said.   A military source denied the new rules were designed to forcepeople to pay the outstanding bills.   ``It's time to replace the ID cards because there are many oldones, torn ones, without pictures. You cannot see exactly what'swritten on them,'' said the source, who spoke on condtion ofanonymity.   The source said cards would only be renewed in Gaza, not in theWest Bank. He did not elaborate.   Scattered Palestinian protests were reported in the West Bank.Arab reporters said police fired tear gas and rubber bullets todisperse about 200 Arabs in Ramallah. No injuries were reported.   During Sunday's regular Cabinet meeting, Energy Minister MosheShahal of the Labor Party proposed draft legislation aimed atlimiting the defense minister's powers to decide on militaryoperations without consulting the 24-member Cabinet.   Cabinet members have complained that Defense Minister YitzhakRabin, also a Labor member, did not inform them of the scope of thearmy's Lebanon action last week.   Rabin and several other Cabinet members defended the action,saying it stayed within the framework of defending Israel'snorthern border.</TEXT></DOC>
