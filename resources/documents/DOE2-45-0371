The report is focussedon identification of the primary processes that are involved in suchalteration, the release of silica and the microstructural changes associatedwith heating being of major interest. In the first test phase, Na montmorillonitein distilled water was investigated by XRD, rheology tests and electronmicroscopy after heating to 60-225/sup 0/C for 0.01 to 1 year. The preliminaryconclusions are that heating produces contraction of the particle networkto form dense 'branches', the effect being most obvious at the highesttemperature but of significance even at 60-100/sup 0/C. Release of substantialamounts of silica gas been documented for temperatures exceeding 150/sup0/ and precipitation of silica was observed on cooling after the hydrothermaltesting under the closed conditions that prevailed throughout the tests.The precipitates, which appeared to be amorphous and probably consistedof hydrous silica gels, were concluded to have increased the mechanicalstrength and caused some brittleness, particularly of the dense clays.The nature of the silica release, which is assumed to be associated withbeidellitization, may be closely related to an unstable state of a certainfraction of tetrahedral silica at heat-inducted transfer between twodifferent crystal modes of montmorillonite.</TEXT></DOC>
