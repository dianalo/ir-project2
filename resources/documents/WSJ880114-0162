Mine is 39,000 fatalities per year in the U.S., not his 1,000. Avoiding careless X-ray overdosing is probably the most important single step, other than not smoking, which any family can take to reduce its cancer risk.    Prof. Cohen's low estimate corresponds with the scientifically discredited estimate of one cancer fatality per 10,000 personrads of exposure published by the United Nations' radiation committee in 1977 and 1982. In its 1986 report, even the U.N. committee abandoned defense of this value. The U.N. risk-value is so indefensible that it no longer takes independent scientists like myself to say so. In September 1987, D.L. Preston and D.A. Pierce, who work within the heart of the radiation community, published a technical report showing that the U.N. value is too low by at least 16-fold. This step toward radiation realism is important news for the 70% of Americans who take X-rays each year and for over a million occupationally exposed workers.    John W.
