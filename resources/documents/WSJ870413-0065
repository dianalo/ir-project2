For the most part, it worked, but it also helped create the conditions that led to yesterday's bankruptcy-law filing.    Texaco flourished as an oil company with too little oil. In its time it was the nation's leading refiner and retailer of gasoline, the only company ever to have filling stations in all 50 states over a sustained period.    Certainly, the company's crude shortage was evident in several notable events, such as its 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. in the transaction that caused Pennzoil Co. to file its monumental suit. And over the weekend, the company's dependence on outside crude suppliers -- companies who are now fearful of dealing with the company -- almost caused Texaco to shutter one of its huge U.S. refineries for lack of sufficient feedstock to process.    It was a condition created in the earliest days of this century, when &quot;Buckskin&quot; Joe Cullinen, a rough-hewn Irishman from the oil fields of western Pennsylvania, passed up the opportunity to invest in an oil well about to be drilled on a little hill in Beaumont, Texas. The well was called Spindletop, and the resulting gusher touched off the most frenetic oil boom ever.    While grousing over his failure to get in on the ground floor of the Texas oil boom, Buckskin Joe quickly sensed opportunity of a different kind. A giant puddle of crude had accumulated beneath the forest of oil derricks for lack of a market. Buckskin Joe would help create one.    He enlisted backing from the Lapham brothers of New York, who controlled the nation's Leather Trust, and from several other capitalists, most of whom were from the North. Buckskin Joe's Texas Co. -- so named to preserve the hometown character of an operation financed with so much Yankee money -- built storage tanks, pipelines, barges, docks and railroad terminals, moving crude to the sugar grinders of Louisiana and to the crude-short refineries of the North.    But when Buckskin Joe decided that Texas Co. needed more of its own oil in the ground, his backers balked at his costly ambitions and set up an executive committee in New York to rein him in. Fearful that the company would be relocated to New York from its new headquarters in Houston, Buckskin Joe in 1913 launched a proxy fight, lost, and quit the company he had founded. Before long, the company's headquarters were moved to New York, where they eventually assumed space in the Chrysler Building and later moved to suburban White Plains. &quot;New York water and Texas oil,&quot; the Houston Chronicle warned, &quot;aren't going to mix very well.&quot;    The company came into two windfalls of oil in the ground over the next decades, acquiring the drilling rights to about one million acres of &quot;easy&quot; oil fields in marshy southern Louisiana and trading its way into a venture with Standard Oil Co. (California) -- now Chevron Corp. -- to produce oil in a sheikdom called Saudi Arabia.    But Texas Co. remained intent on concentrating on the distribution end of the business and always put the customer first -- even when the customers included Franco's Spain and prewar Nazi Germany. After a spate of embarrassing publicity over the company's relationship with those regimes, Texas Co. began its sponsorship of the Metropolitan Opera, which continues to this day.    But with its sprawling network of refineries and -- for a while, at least, until the Mideast fields were nationalized and the Louisiana reserves dwindled -- its huge supplies of crude, Texaco's preeminence as a gasoline retailer became evident on street corners all over the country. Texaco helped pioneer national television advertising, with Milton Berle and the Texaco Star Theater and Bob Hope in his Texaco Fire Chief helmet. It created, practically singlehandedly, one of the world's largest petrochemical refining corridors between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La., by luring chemical companies with low-priced, long-term natural-gas contracts.    In the 1960s, the company, now officially named Texaco, didn't foresee that its halcyon days were numbered. A trade group banded together in an advertising campaign to warn that the nation was running out of oil, but Texaco, conspicuously, refused to support the campaign.    Practically overnight in the early 1970s, the nation's energy production indeed turned downward -- and Texaco's more than most. Because its poor oil position forced it to pay the sharply higher prices its outside suppliers now demanded, it began failing to meet its delivery commitments under its huge natural-gas contracts. Settling one threatened lawsuit -- from Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co. -- caused Texaco's first entry into the record book of astonishing legal cases: Texaco had to pay about $1.8 billion to escape from the contracts.    Refineries were closed because they couldn't be operated profitably with purchased feedstocks. Texaco earnings and bond ratings slipped from their once lofty levels. The company encountered more than its share of exploration disappointments, including its participation in the Mukluk wildcat well near Deadhorse, Alaska, where the company and its partners drilled the most expensive dry hole in history. Texaco took bold steps to retrench its high-cost refining network, but it still had an insufficient supply of crude. Texaco entered the 1980s in a state of rapid self-liquidation.    Then, in the first few days of 1984, Getty Oil was completing the final paper work on a complex, hard-fought merger plan with Pennzoil. Oil-hungry Texaco jumped onto the scene, outbidding Pennzoil and quickly taking Getty for itself. At $10.1 billion, it was, at the time, the largest acquisition in history, planting the seeds for history's largest court judgment -- and largest bankruptcy-law case.    ---                     Texaco in 1986  Revenue                             $32.59 billion  Net income                          $725 million  Net per share                       $3.01  Average common  shares outstanding                  240.5 million  Assets                              $34.94 billion  Net proved crude oil                3.22 billion  and gas liquid reserves             barrels  World-wide crude oil  and gas liquid                      1.3 million  production                          barrels a day  Net proved natural                  8.17 trillion  gas reserves                        cubic feet  World-wide                          1.96 billion  natural gas                         cubic feet  production                          a day   Note: All figures are for year ending Dec. 31, 1986</TEXT></DOC>
