Outof them, 137 cases with sufficient follow-up during the period from 1973to 1982 were analyzed to evaluated the tolerance of the pelvic structuresas well as the results. The cumulative 3-year local control rate was100 % in stage I (8 cases), 85 % in stage II (33 cases), 60 % in stageIII (81 cases), and 0 % in stage IV (15 cases), while the cumulative5-year survival rate was 69.4 % in stage I, 68.1 % in stage II, 40.6% in stage III, and 0 % in stage IV. The cumulative incidence of complicationswas 38.6 % in GII + GIII and 27.0 % in GIII, respectively. Equivalentdose over 120 of TDF at point A had been delivered in most cases thatshowed late complications requiring medical management. Therefore, thetolerance dose of the pelvic structures in this irradiation techniquewas supposed to be about 120 of total TDF at point A. We conclude thatbi-axial pendulum external irradiation technique should be applied foradvanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix which are unsuitable to intracavitaryirradiation for social, anatomical, and other medical reasons.</TEXT></DOC>
