SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Tom Bradley proudly calls Los Angeles``the new Ellis Island,'' where waves of immigrants have producedamazing cultural diversity.   But increasingly schools, courts and businesses throughoutSouthern California are struggling to cope with scores of languagesthat threaten to create a metropolitan Babel.   Examples abound:   _The Los Angeles Unified School District tries to teach mostcourses in the students' native languages until they develop fluencyin English. The task is monumental: 160,000 students have as theirprimary tongues more than 80 languages, from Afghan, Afrikaans andAmharic to Urdu, Yoruba and Yiddish.   _During last year's fire in the city's tallest skyscraper,emergency announcements were in English and largely useless. Nearlyall the 50 people in the building that night were janitors who spokeonly Spanish.   _In Orange County, commonly associated with surfers andDisneyland, minorities make up more than 40 percent of public schoolstudents, and a recent poll found the 100,000 Vietnamese residentsfelt their top need was English-language classes.   Police in the Orange County cities of Westminster and GardenGrove have recruited Vietnamese speakers to investigate tight-knitAsian gangs. The Santa Ana school district had to turn away abouthalf the 800 Spanish-speakers who waited in line, some overnight, tosign up for English courses.   _Tens of thousands of Soviet Armenians and Jews have poured intothe area in recent years as the Soviet Union relaxed emigrationpolicies. Overwhelmed social workers say the refugees must beeducated quickly or risk becoming permanently dependent on thegovernment.   The number of refugees streaming into Los Angeles County fromaround the world has tripled since 1985, reaching a high of 19,011in 1988. But federal funds to help the newcomers dropped from $7.1million in 1985 to $2.8 million last year.   _In Glendale, for decades another white suburban bastion, asurvey last spring found that 54.5 percent of the students in cityschools came from homes where English was not the primary language;more than 60 languages were spoken.   On rare occasions, the problems can be comical. Glendale teacherMatilda Mardirossian was glad that Michael Dukakis lost theelection, not because of politics but because of his name, which ispronounced the same as an off-color phrase in Armenian, the firstlanguage spoken by many of her students.   ``They were giggling over his name,'' she said. ``I definitelydidn't want to hear it for the next four years.''   Most skirmishes in the war of words are more serious.   Last month, Executive Life Insurance Co. dropped an English-onlyrule for employees rather than fight a civil rights suit filed bythe local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and theAsian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California.   ``Los Angeles, and California as a state, are at a turning point,as far as being a global center of many cultures,'' said StewartKwoh, the founder of the legal center. ``And while English is theprincipal language through which we converse, it is not going to bepossible for us to play a leadership role if we cannot accept otherlanguages and cultures.''   But acceptance can come slowly in cities like Monterey Park, 10miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The city of 62,000 became knownas the ``first suburban Chinatown'' or the ``Chinese Beverly Hills''as Asians, many of them affluent, supplanted Anglos and Hispanics asthe majority group.   Most signs along the Atlantic Boulevard business strip are now inChinese as well as English, with Ai Hoa Supermarket and Bank ofCanton of California competing for attention with Security PacificBank and Pic 'n' Save. Chinese-language newspapers outnumber Englishpapers in sidewalk news racks.   Monterey Park Mayor Barry L. Hatch has loudly called for a ban onimmigration into the United States, supports a law making Englishthe official U.S. language, and crusades against non-English booksat the library.   ``Monterey Park is a beautiful little suburban town, almost ruralin some parts. And now we drive through our little commercial areaand feel like we're in Hong Kong,'' he said. ``When you're an Angloor Hispanic and you can't read the signs, it makes you feel like asecond-class citizen.''   Other nearby cities have reacted with laws dictating how muchEnglish must appear on signs: Temple City (100 percent in Englishdowntown, 50 percent in outlying areas), Arcadia (70 percent),Pomona and Rosemead (50 percent).   ``Historically, immigrants have come to America with theunderstanding they're going to have to give up their primarylanguage,'' Hatch said. ``Now we're looking at floods of immigrantswho say to hell with the process _ we'll do it our way.''   Inevitably, disputes wind up in court.   One lawsuit that failed in state court in 1987 wanted the LosAngeles school district to immediately provide English classes to40,000 foreign language speakers, despite the fact that 200,000people already were enrolled in such classes and the district saidstate funds for them had run out.   A suit pending in federal court contends aliens are deprived oftheir rights in Southern California immigration courts by ineptinterpreters and a practice of translating only parts of deportationhearings.   Seven people worked as translators for Los Angeles County courtsin 1962. Today 453 do, interpreting 70 languages and dialects, with257 Spanish translators by far the most numerous.   Ed Johnson, director of interpreter-translator services, saidabout 300 interpreters work in the county's municipal and superiorcourts on a typical day. The 1962 translation budget was about$30,000, he said; this year's is about $6 million.   Sophia Zahler, who heads the federal court translation servicehere, says Spanish speakers account for 95 percent of interpretersused in federal courts nationwide. But in California, the ``other''category jumps to 20 percent, with demand for Korean, Tagalog, Thai,Armenian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Farsi, Hebrew and even Tongan.   Some profit by the linguistic gridlock, such as accent-reductionteachers who charge $60 to $85 a session for a dozen individualsessions. There are hundreds of takers.   Others see benefits in language differences.   At Edison Elementary School in a Hispanic section of SantaMonica, kindergarten and first grade pupils are taught in Spanishexcept for one oral English class, regardless of whether students'parents speak English or Spanish. English-language classes aregradually added, working up to a 50-50 language mix in sixth grade.   ``The Edison School project assumes that both Hispanics andAnglos will emerge competent in both languages,'' said Russell N.Campbell, a UCLA linguistics professor.   Similar programs may be set up in Koreatown, Little Tokyo orChinatown, but Campbell acknowledged they will remain special.   ``It just isn't possible in a class where a teacher is facing 15kids who speak different languages,'' he said. ``And what do we doabout those classes with the single kid who speaks Lao or Hmong?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, March 8</NOTE></DOC>
