Inthe past, efforts to use animal bioassays in the evaluation of the potentialhealth risk of chemicals to humans were hampered by the lack of standardizedmethod of comparing experimental results. Experimental protocols as wellas the type of information reported in the literature are quite diverse.Moreover, quantitative estimates of carcinogenic potency had not beenmade for large numbers of chemical carcinogens. 10 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
