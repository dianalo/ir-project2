<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-21-1252 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for studying the magnetic field of permanent magnet devices ispresented. The model adopted for the permanent magnet constitutive lawallows the analysis of the static behaviour of these devices and alsothe dynamic one for magnets operating on a linear demagnetization curve.The magnetic field equation is written in terms of the vector potentialand is specified for systems invariant by rotation. The equation is representedby a variational formulation and is solved by the finite element method.The analysis is applied to examples of magnetic bearings that have rotationalsymmetry. The values of the force between the magnets, calculated byMaxwell's tensor, are in good agreement with the experimental data.</TEXT></DOC>
