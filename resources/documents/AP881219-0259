Within a few months of the worst stock market debacle in moderntimes, American companies scrambled as never before to merge, spinoff, sell out, pare down and restructure _ all in the name ofefficiency, growth, competitiveness and long-term survival.   The orgy of dealmaking, reminiscent of the 1920s corporateborrowing binge that preceded the Great Depression, has raiseddisturbing questions about the direction U.S. business will take asit struggles to meet the mortgage.   Since 1982, U.S. companies have doubled their debt to nearly $2trillion. An estimated 25 percent of their cash flow is used toservice debt, money that theoretically could be used for investingin research, training or expansion.   In 1988 alone, the dollar amount of mergers and acquisitionsfinanced largely with borrowed money totaled more than $200 billion,enough to wipe out the U.S. trade deficit and erase a good chunk ofThird World debt.   Many economists are concerned about what will happen if highlyindebted companies someday cannot pay the interest they owe. Theysay stores will shut, factories will close, tax revenues willtumble, unemployment will soar.   Some fear that the billions of dollars in investment needed tokeep American companies competitive could be sacrificed to pay debt,giving foreign economic rivals such as the Japanese even more of anedge.   Others say bankers, insurers and pension funds that loaned themoney for takeovers will wind up holding securities that could sellfor 50 cents or less on the dollar _ a domestic version of the ThirdWorld debt disaster.   ``I must admit I view with alarm what's going on now,'' saidSandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, a Washington-basedconsulting firm. ``These increased debt levels, if we go intorecession, would be quite worrisome.''   The rising corporate debt already is rippling through the economyin troubling ways, such as higher interest rates, increasedbankruptcies, layoffs and greater use of cheap part-time andtemporary workers to cut costs.   Those 30 percent discount Christmas sales at Macy's andBloomingdale's haven't been meant to raise holiday cheer: The ownersof these stores need quick cash to service the enormous debt loadsof their restructured companies.   When the diversified manufacturer Interco Inc. announced it wasclosing two Florsheim shoe factories in early December, a huge debtrestructuring to thwart a hostile takeover was to blame.   When workers of Trans World Airlines and Eastern Airlines askedthe government earlier this year to review whether the owners runsafe operations, they said high debt in those carriers were hurtingmaintenance and preventing investment in new planes. Both airlineswere bought on borrowed money.   Last July, the Revco D.S. drug chain became the first bigdebt-financed takeover company to seek bankruptcy protection fromcreditors. While it generates $100 million in cash a year, that'snowhere near enough to service more than $1 billion in debt.   ``It's our feeling that with the amount of money raised in thebuyout market in the last several years, the amount of deals done,and the levels done, you're going to see a substantially greateramount of defaulted and bankrupt companies coming out,'' said JamesBennett, chief executive officer of R.D. Smith andamp; Co., a New Yorkfirm that trades in distressed companies' bonds.   Just in the last few months, Bennett says, the volume ofdistressed bonds has equaled the total he'd seen in more than thanthree years, and ``if you start to have a recessionary period,there's going to be a ton of them.''   The concern about corporate debt and its broader impact isn'tlimited to economists, labor unions and bond traders. Even some ofthe most aggressive promoters and beneficiaries of debt-financedtakeovers have expressed concern about whether the dealmaking hasgone too far.   ``Today's financial age has become a period of unbridled excesswith accepted risk soaring out of proportion to possible reward,''said Theodore J. Forstmann, head of the New York takeover firmForstmann, Little andamp; Co.   ``Every week, with ever-increasing levels of irresponsibility,many billions of dollars in American assets are being saddled withdebt that has virtually no chance of being repaid.''   Even as concern rises about the implications of rising corporatedebt, more managers are lining up lenders to help buy theircompanies or prevent outsiders from doing so.   A recent study by Drexel University finance professor GeorgeTsetsekos suggested that among companies that bought back their ownstock to boost share values after the October 1987 crash, one infour was increasing debt levels, partly as an antitakeover move.   Bank lenders, historically burned by bad real estate and LatinAmerican loans, haven't expressed much reticence about the latestborrowing wave either, despite a blunt warning by Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan to carefully evaluate their takeover-loanportfolios.   A Fed survey earlier this year suggested that 15 percent ofcommercial and industrial loans were related to mergers, and at somebig banks the figure was as high as 40 percent.   One of the key catalysts in this new avalanche of debt is thetakeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or LBO, in which abuyer with practically no money can purchase a company using itsassets as collateral for loans, sell pieces of the company to repaythose loans and make a profit in the process.   The result has often been a trimmed-down and highly efficientprivate company liberated from the obligation of paying quarterlydividends to shareholders and able to concentrate on its business.But it may also result in so much indebtedness that managementbecomes preoccupied with paying it back.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
