<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-03-0897 </DOCNO><TEXT>During the period the project was divided in three research areas: Abiotics(meteorology, hydrology and increment dynamics), Ecological physiologyand plant breeding, and Ground (establishment and production). The generalaims were the development of the necessary knowledge of biological andcultivation technical fundamentals to achieve high productive durableartificial regeneration, generate suitable clones for selected regions,and currently supply knowledge to cultivation activities put in practice.The results are presented under the following headings: Abiotics; A1Bioclimate, A2 Increment dynamics, A3 Increment modelling. Ecologicalphysiology; B1 Gas-exchange of Salix, B2 Water and mineral nutrient requirements,B3 Insects and energy forests, B4 Reduction of production losses, B5Meristem activity and increment patterns by fast growing species of Salix,B6 Breeding of Salix species for growing energy forests. Ground, establishmentand production; C1 Ground and supply of plant nutrients, C2 Root developmentand root dynamics, C3 Nutrient emission and nutrient circulation, C4Clone selection, tests, records and plantation, C5 Cultivation preparationsand stand establishment, C6 Production by different spacing and intervals,C7 Biological nitrogen fixation, and production ability of Alnus.</TEXT></DOC>
