That fear has given way to asigh of relief.   Under a cramdown, if the market value of a house hasdropped below the owner's mortgage balance, a bankruptcyjudge may reduce the mortgage obligation to the home'scurrent value. The rest of the loan becomes unsecured debt onwhich lenders typically collect only about 10 cents on thedollar.   Though cramdowns are an accepted practice in businessbankruptcies, they were rarely tried in personal bankruptciesuntil 1989, when the federal appeals court in San Franciscoupheld a residential cramdown in an Oregon case. As courts inother states followed suit, residential lenders worried thata tidal wave of cramdowns would ensue.   But the lending industry reports only a ripple ofattempted cramdowns. The Federal National MortgageAssociation, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, which together areinvolved in the bulk of new single-family conventionalfinancing -- report only some 25 cases of attemptedcramdowns.   Cramdowns aren't especially popular with borrowers becausethey still have to pay the same monthly mortgage while facinglengthy appeals from lenders, says Thomas M. Ducey, directorof loan servicing and lender standards for Fannie Mae.   Moreover, lenders are contesting attempted cramdowns byarguing that the bankruptcy code exempts home mortgages fromsuch treatment. The code is ambiguous on that point, butCongress is likely to consider legislation that would amendthe code to make clear the exemption for home mortgages.                                                                                                          Push Falters for Change   In Partnership Roll-Ups                                                                                                          SUPPORTERS of reform in partnership conversions areturning to Washington for help after narrowly losing anattempt in California to enact the country's firstlegislation protecting battered roll-up investors.   The legislation would have required roll-ups of limitedpartnerships, in which limited partners receive stock in anew company in exchange for their holdings, to be reviewedfor fairness by the state during a six-month period pendingreview of a more permanent reform law.   Investors in roll-ups -- particularly real-estate limitedpartnerships, which have plunged in value along withcollapsing property markets -- say the process isintrinsically unfair because they have little input, andoften the only beneficiaries are the general partners andsecurities firms that receive fees and compensation by takingthe roll-ups public.   The California measure lost by one vote after heavylobbying by the Investment Program Association. The group,representing general partners and Wall Street securitiesfirms, sent its members a memo asking for donations to a&quot;key&quot; legislator on a day the rollup bill was being debated.   Christopher David, president of the trade group,apologized and recanted the request after the legislatorprotested. Mr. David says he had no idea the reform matterwas still under review. He also insists that his groupdoesn't oppose roll-up reform, but thought California'smeasure was being rushed through.   Supporters of the measure say the trade group fiercelyopposes any reform and outguns them on the state level. &quot;It'svery difficult for us to fight them because their resourcesare so horrendously large vs. ours,&quot; says Richard Wollack,chairman of the Liquidity Fund, an investment firm inEmeryville, Calif. &quot;It's now up to our Washington leaders.&quot; Aroll-up reform proposal is pending in the House, due for avote this session.                                                                                                          Shift in RTC Rules   Depresses Appraisers   TEXAS real-estate appraisers thrived during the oil bustbecause they had so many foreclosed properties to assess. Butmany are running out of work because of a change by theResolution Trust Corp. in appraisal rules on the veryproperties on which they had grown to depend.   The RTC, with a $160 billion portfolio from defunctsavings and loans to sell, has reduced the frequency ofrequired appraisals for properties valued at more than $2.5million to one every two years from two a year. The change,which applies to properties whose loans are current, isintended to streamline the sales process. The RTC also didaway with a third appraisal in case of a dispute.   Since an appraisal cottage industry had developed inTexas, where RTC assets are concentrated, the ruling hascaused large layoffs among the state's appraisal corps. &quot;Iwould say we have a third less business than we had 12 monthsago,&quot; says Bill C. Dotson, president of Dallas-based AllianceAppraisal Group, which has fired seven of its 26 appraisers.   &quot;It's just been devastating,&quot; adds Mark Donoho, anappraiser in Dallas. &quot;One appraiser walked into his officeand laid off eight people.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          ECONOMIC vacancies for apartments, which best gauge theproperties' health, ranged from 9.67% to 11.7% in differentregions last year, down from 9.95% to 13.31% in 1989, theNational Apartment Association says.
