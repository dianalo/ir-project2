(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury found two former Californiabusiness executives guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud today inthe first trial stemming from the government's investigation ofPentagon procurement practices.   But the jury, which deliberated more than 35 hours over fourdays, found George Kaub and Eugene Sullivan, along with a thirddefendant, innocent of bribery charges.   Dale Schnittjer was acquitted on the bribery charges, along withfour other counts. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on oneother conspiracy count and one wire fraud count against Schnittjerand the judge ordered those counts dropped.   Kaub and Sullivan were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraudand Kaub was also found guilty on two counts of filing falsestatements.   Kaub, Sullivan and Schnittjer were all vice presidents ofTeledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a defense contractor.The government claimed they conspired to hire a private consultantwho in turn bribed a Navy engineer in order to help the firm obtaina $24 million contract to build hand-held radar test equipment.   The defense argued the businessmen were unwillingly duped byprivate consultant William Parkin, who actually arranged for thescheme. The defendants knew nothing about illegal efforts to obtaininside information on the contract that Teledyne was awarded inJuly 1987, defense attorneys said.   The jury agreed with the government that Kaub and Sullivan hadengaged in a consipracy with Parkin and his associates, all of whompleaded guilty in advance of the trial before U.S. District JudgeRichard Williams.   Kaub and Sullivan were each found guilty of one count ofconspiracy. In addition, Kaub was convicted on five counts of wirefraud, while Sullivan was convicted on three wire fraud counts.Those charges stem from the wiretapped conversations between thedefendants and private consultants, which were played for the juryand formed a central part of the government's evidence.</TEXT><TEXT>   Kaub was also convicted of filing false statements, charges thatderived from papers he authorized to be sent to the DefenseDepartment stating that Teledyne had not used private consultantsto work on the contract.   Each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of five years inprison and $250,000 in fines. Kaub faces a maximum sentence of 40years in jail and a maximum fine of $2 million; Sullivan, 20 yearsand $1 million.   Williams set sentencing for June 7 and allowed the defendants toremain free on bail.   Parkin, Fred Lackner and Stuart Berlin, a Navy official, allpleaded guilty in the case before the federal trial began lastweek. They cooperated with the government, as did TeledyneIndustries, the parent of Teledyne Electronics. Teledyne entered aguilty plea in advance of the trial to counts of conspiracy andfiling false statements.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said he was pleased withthe verdict and that it represented ``significant convictions.'' Hesaid the government's investigation into the Pentagon procurementprocess is ``expanding and continuing.''   Attorneys for Kaub and Sullivan said they would appeal theguilty convictions.</TEXT></DOC>
