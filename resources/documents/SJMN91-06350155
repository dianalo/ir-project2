He became the Giants' general manager in September 1985and turned the franchise around. He hired Roger Craig as his manager andrenovated the minor league and scouting systems. He traded for Kevin Mitchell,Dave Dravecky, Craig Lefferts, Don Robinson and Rick Reuschel. The Giants wentfrom a 100-loss team to a World Series team.;   Rosen is one of the fewbaseball executives left who can pull the trigger on a deal without scurryingfor permission here and there, but the trade he made with Seattle on Wednesdaysimply made one thing clearer: He's in a slump.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ROSEN IS IN A SLUMP  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Baseball Report; Some information in this report was obtained from writers inother cities.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Mitchell was dumped to Seattle, along with first-round draft flop MikeRemlinger, for no-name pitchers Billy Swift, Mike Jackson and Dave Burba. Inroom 1420 at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Fla., maintenance crewshave begun efforts to extricate a panic button that was smashed through awall.;   Cincinnati added Greg Swindell and Tim Belcher to a rotation thatincludes Jose Rijo and Tom Browning. Los Angeles added Tom Candiotti to arotation that includes Ramon Martinez and Orel Hershiser. Atlanta brings backSteve Avery, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz. San Diego has Andy Benes and BruceHurst. If the Giants could not find a dominant pitcher to keep up withNational League West, they at least should have kept the best lineup.;   Thisis assuming Rosen is through for the winter, but now the Giants have a wimpyoutfield, a fragile starting rotation and a wholesome image. Even if TrevorWilson comes into his own and Bud Black loses fewer than 16 games, the Giantswill rebuild. Will Clark will see fewer strikes. Ken Griffey Jr. and Mitchellwill make baseball's most fearsome pair. Bill Plummer's Mariners will be acontender looking for a home.;   Perhaps the Giants' scouts will be right andBurba eventually will pay off. Maybe Swift's sinkerball will work well atCandlestick Park. But for now, the deal stands as the prominent at-bat in aprotracted slump. Consider:;   (check) Pitchers Terry Mulholland and DennisCook and infielder Charlie Hayes were traded to Philadelphia in August 1989for pitcher Steve Bedrosian and a player to be named, who turned out to beoutfielder Rick Parker. Bedrosian was some help as the Giants went to theWorld Series, but not the key. Mulholland no-hit the Giants in 1990 and theGiants' efforts to reacquire him for Mitchell recently were unsuccessful.Parker was waived Monday to make room for Rule 5 draftee Rafael Quirico.;  (check) Kevin Bass was signed to a lucrative three-year contract as a freeagent in November 1989. He was going to fill the void in right field. But thiswas not the Bass whom Rosen had known when he was Houston's general manageryears earlier. Bass hit .252 and then missed the rest of the 1990 season withknee surgery. Still hampered, he hit .233 in 124 games for the Giants lastseason.;   (check) Catcher Gary Carter and shortstop Dave Anderson were signedin January 1990 as Rosen sought experienced winners who could get the teamover the hump. Carter was a shadow of himself and lasted one season. Andersonmade a great player representative (which is just one of the Giants' needsnow).;   (check) Free agents Bud Black, Willie McGee and Dave Righetti weresigned after the 1990 season for a combined $33 million. The four-year, $10million deal for Black, a .500 pitcher, was widely criticized as a springboardfor a salary escalation still out of control. Rosen predicted that Black wouldwin more games than any free-agent pitcher from that crop, and Black went onto become the losingest despite a good start. McGee hit one of the softest.312s in recent memory. Righetti had two save opportunities in the first twomonths, a wasted tool.;   (check) Closing those 1990 winter meetings, Rosentraded infielder Ernest Riles to the A's for outfielder Darren Lewis and aplayer to be named (pitcher Pedro Pena), and also traded Bedrosian toMinnesota for pitcher Johnny Ard and a player to be named (pitcher JimmyWilliams). The Lewis trade should be the exception in this slump, although a1-for-41 skid down the stretch still means skeptics. Ard was 3-5 with a 5.78ERA for Triple-A Phoenix, but he may have gotten it together by proceeding togo 9-3 with a 2.74 ERA for Double-A Shreveport.;   (check) Brett Butler, thetable-setter for Clark, Mitchell and Matt Williams, was allowed to walk as asecond-look free agent and was replaced in center by McGee. The Robby ThompsonLeadoff Experiment failed, and Butler made his first All-Star team.;   This isto say nothing of those long-term contracts given to Jose Uribe, AtleeHammaker and Mike LaCoss. Mike Felder seemed to be a good waiver-wire pickuplast spring, but his average decreased each month until a decent finish. Thebench needed pop all season, but Rick Leach had been waived.;   No one inbaseball can wheel and deal the way Rosen can. His record shows that. But aswith players, general managers are entitled to an occasional slump.; POSTMORTEM: The Giants unloaded Mitchell's $3.75 million salary, but the deal is awash. Swift made $925,000 plus incentives in 1991, Jackson $745,000. Both areunsigned and eligible for arbitration, and both could be free agents after1992. . . . What a country. Otis Nixon wound up the season in drugrehabilitation and then re-signed with Atlanta for two years and $5.6 million.. . . Until next spring. . . .  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mark Newman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911215  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  15D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  959  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 15, 199100350155,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
