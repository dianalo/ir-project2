(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Buoyed by a flawless countdown and agood weather forecast, NASA was set to launch space shuttleDiscovery on Monday with five astronauts and a cargo that includes a$100 million satellite and four crippled rats.   At 11:58 p.m., launch pad workers began to pump 528,000 gallonsof supercold liquid hydrogen and oxygen into the shuttle's externaltank. The chemicals will fuel the three main rocket engines thatmust fire for 8{ minutes to put Discovery into orbit.   Liftoff was set for 8:07 a.m. EST. Forecasts called for clearskies, and mild temperatures _ ideal for launch of the first shuttlemission of 1989. Only the possibility of strong high-altitude windsgave any concern, and NASA officials said wind conditions atmidnight were favorable for the launch.   ``Tomorrow morning is a great day to go fly,'' shuttle bossRichard Truly said at a Sunday afternoon news conference. ``Theweather has been getting prettier and prettier. We're in goodshape.''   The countdown proceeded so smoothly on Sunday that preparationsskipped two hours ahead of schedule.   ``It seems a little scary it's going so well,'' said ChuckHenschel, launch test director. ``We're ahead of where we want tobe.''   The fault-free countdown was in sharp contrast to the troublesthat plagued NASA in getting Discovery ready for the mission. Theflight originally had a Feb. 18 target date, but a series of faultyor suspect parts delayed the launch four times.   Workers changed out turbo pumps in the main engines when flawswere found in the pumps on sister shuttle Atlantis. Last week, testsshowed a failure in the system that commands the separation of thetwo booster rockets and the external tank. The unit was replacedwith a part removed from Columbia.   Launch of Discovery sets in motion NASA's ambitious plan forseven shuttle missions this year while building toward aonce-a-month flight rate by 1992. The flight will be the third sincethe nation returned to manned spaceflight following the Challengerdisaster of 1986.   Discovery's five-man crew is to be awakened about 3 a.m. Mondayand will board the shuttle at 5:15 a.m.   Waiting for them in cages aboard the ship will be four rats, partof an experiment on the effects of weightlessness on the healing ofinjured bones.   A small piece of bone was clipped from each of the rats, and howwell these injuries heal during five days in weightlessness will bestudied when the rodents are returned to Earth.   Discovery's main job for the 28th shuttle mission is to deliverto orbit a $100 million communications craft called the Tracking andData Relay Satellite. The satellite is the final point in anorbiting communications network that will keep the shuttle and otherspacecraft in almost constant radio contact with the Earth. Thenetwork will enable NASA to shut down six ground tracking stations,saving $3 million a month.   The satellite, called TDRS-4, will be released from Discoveryabout six hours after launch. Two later rocket firings will send theTDRS to a stationary orbit 22,300 miles over the Atlantic Ocean.   NASA already has two such satellites in orbit, but TDRS-1 hasbeen in use since 1983 and is ailing. It will be moved to a newlocation in orbit for use as a spare.   TDRS-2, which was to have been the second in the network, was onboard Challenger when that spacecraft exploded shortly after launch.   Last September, TDRS-3 was deployed from Discovery, during thefirst shuttle flight after the Challenger accident. The satellitenow is over the Pacific Ocean and will be used during the currentmission.   Discovery's crew is led by Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, 43, whois making his second spaceflight. His pilot is Air Force Col. JohnE. Blaha, 46, on his first shuttle mission.   The three missions specialists on the crew are James F. Buchli,43, a Marine colonel who has twice before flown into space; MarineCol. Robert C. Springer, 46, and Dr. James P. Bagian, a 37-year-oldphysician. Both Springer and Bagian are space rookies.   In addition to monitoring the rats, the astronauts will conductother experiments.   Two types of plants will sprout in a small garden on board totest the effects of weightlessness on root growth. Officials saidthis study may develop ways to grow plants aboard the space station.   Scientists also will study the effects weightlessness on thedevelopment of embryos by flying 32 fertilized chicken eggs. Theeggs will be incubated throughout the mission and the embryos willbe compared later with some grown at the same time on the ground.   Discovery is to orbit for five days, one hour and land onSaturday at Edwards Air Force Base in California.</TEXT></DOC>
