Learning to lean on one another is the lesson for the burly white farmers and for the black descendants of Delta field hands who gather in a show of unity at a Democratic rally here.    Religion and race long have been part of this state's politics and will be on Super Tuesday, March 8. One of eight &quot;crossover&quot; states in the South, Mississippi will offer some measure of Pat Robertson's ability to draw conservative white Democrats to the Republican presidential contest. In the Democratic primary, the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign rests on his ability to turn out black voters. He competes most directly with Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, a contemporary white Southerner whose fortunes are interwoven with the black preacher's in this river land of cotton and grain.    Mr. Gore's hope is that a strong showing by himself -- together with the Rev. Jackson -- will allow him to corner delegates and break into what has increasingly become a two-man contest between his chief rivals, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. Mr. Dukakis has focused more on urbanized centers in the South but has potential in Natchez and the state's coastal counties. The grittier struggle is expected to come from Rep. Gephardt's forces, who want to knock Mr. Gore out of the running in what has become a bruising fight for white moderates and conservatives not only in Mississippi but across the central South.    It is a battle with some of the cultural overtones of the fighting between Vice President George Bush and Sen. Robert Dole. Mr. Gephardt's manager, Bill Carrick, makes no secret of his disdain for Mr. Gore, and after months of a populist trade message, a Gephardt southern finance chairman in Jackson speaks less of Hyundais than of hashish. &quot;He is very, very strong against drugs,&quot; says insurance executive Jack Robinson of his candidate. &quot;Which is important because we know Gore has admitted to using drugs.&quot;    As a student and, later, as a soldier in Vietnam, Mr. Gore admits smoking marijuana briefly, but he runs today on Mom, apple pie and an M-16. Television ads portray him as a figure of &quot;strength&quot; in a field of wavering Democrats, and he has endorsements from much of the state's white Democratic establishment.    In the Delta and hills of northeastern Mississippi, the senator's Tennessee background is an asset, but he is a long reach still from the &quot;Ser. Sta. andamp; Gro.&quot; woodframe stores of Mississippi's country roads. This state has the lowest per-capita income in the nation. To succeed, Mr. Gore must bring his message down closer to the people, and one question is whether the challenge from Mr. Gephardt will force him to do so.    The Gephardt appeal to white conservatives is seen in the ruminations of Banks Brasell, a 48-year-old farm equipment dealer in Batesville who leans toward the GOP but is tempted by the Missouri Democrat. Sen. Gore is too liberal in Mr. Brasell's mind. Mr. Robertson has appeal but &quot;I can't afford somebody like that,&quot; he concludes. Mr. Gephardt, by comparison, succeeds because he addresses underlying concerns with a message that evokes more feelings than specifics. &quot;He seems to be fine and true in what he says,&quot; Mr. Brasell says. &quot;I believe him. Maybe because I want to.&quot;    Mr. Gore actively seeks support from the state's large black population but encounters not only his own limitations but the deeper loyalty commanded by the Rev. Jackson. White voters appear more receptive to him this year than in the past, and among blacks his strength is built not only on race but on a history of commitment here. &quot;He's walked with us, he's marched with us,&quot; says Jean Phillips, head of a Delta social service agency. &quot;He's been in the meetings and churches. That goes deep.&quot;    The Rev. Jackson could finish first here. Though he's hurt by a shortage in campaign funds, his backers tap into a network of black radio stations that have a long reach in the community. For most black Mississippians, the March 8 primary represents their first opportunity to express support for the Rev. Jackson. A campaign song, &quot;Run Jesse Run, Win Jesse Win,&quot; is broadcast upon request in Jackson and across the Delta over station WOKJ. &quot;If Gephardt gets a record, I'll play his too,&quot; says station manager Jimmy Anthony.    The competition between Sen. Gore and the Rev. Jackson is an unusual display of two modern Southerners, white and black, competing for the presidency and one another's constituencies. For both, Mississippi is a battle ground to show how real their powers are. &quot;If Rev. Jackson's supporters would simply believe and look at the numbers, we can win,&quot; says Mike Alexander, Mr. Jackson's 31-year-old state coordinator. &quot;We can only lose by the margin of our disbelief.&quot;    Mr. Jackson's numbers begin in Mississippi with a black population that's currently about 35%, but equally important is where white Democrats go. Super Tuesday is as new to voters here as to the rest of the nation and in a crossover state with no party registration, estimates vary widely as to the size -- and political significance -- of turnout on each side.    Led by Haley Barbour, a GOP strategist in Yazoo City, Republicans are positioned already to claim victory in the turnout contest, but in fact the whole experience with presidential primaries is so new here (Mississippi previously held caucuses) and through much of the South, that it is difficult to establish meaningful comparisons.    At the state level, GOP primaries typically attract few voters, but more voters participated in the Democratic gubernatorial primaries last year than in the final election. Moreover, for many the presidential campaign still takes second place to primary races in two congressional districts and a statewide fight among the Democrats as to who will run for retiring Sen. John Stennis's seat. In this contest, Rep. Wayne Dowdy is matched against Secretary of State Dick Molpus, and many Democrats will be reluctant to turn their backs on this closely fought contest when they will still have a chance to vote Republican in the fall.    Vice President Bush is favored by much of the Mississippi GOP political establishment. The biggest uncertainty comes back to Mr. Robertson. There is a familiarity -- and a certain contempt -- toward the former television evangelist among many voters. But his appeal runs to the highest levels of the old Democratic structure.    Consider former Gov. Bill Waller, who attended a rally for Sen. Gore in Jackson this month but remains publicly uncommitted. Part of this is genuine indecision, he says. Part too goes to his wife's &quot;leanings&quot; toward Mr. Robertson. &quot;I'm a Democrat,&quot; he says, &quot;We'd just like to work these things out together if we can.&quot;    ---                         Mississippi    Voting-age population (1980):           1.7 million                                            68% white,                                            31% black,                                            1% Hispanic    Per-capita income (1986):               $9,716, 66% of                                            the average and                                            lowest of the                                            50 states.
