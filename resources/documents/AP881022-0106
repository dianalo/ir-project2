(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Representatives of 300 Indian tribeswill meet here this week to set a national agenda of Indianconcerns to be presented to the next president of the United States.   The National Congress of American Indians, one of the nation'soldest and largest Indian organizations, begins its 45th annualconvention Monday.   ``Basically, we're going to develop a blueprint of what we wouldlike the new administration and the Congress to do,'' said SuzanShown Harjo of Washington, D.C., the executive director of theorganization.   Among the issues to be discussed are hunting and fishing rights,gaming regulation, health care, economic development and promotionof treaty rights. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska is host of theconvention.   Norma Stealer, vice chairman of the Winnebago tribal council,said the convention is particularly important in a presidentialelection year.   ``Whenever someone new gets elected, they bring in a brand newadministration, and we have to start our education efforts all overagain,'' she said. ``It is an ongoing effort to bring the issuesthat concern Indian peoples to the attention of those who make thedecisions.''   The congress is a non-partisan organization representing Indiansof both political parties, Stealer said.   ``We work at consensus-building,'' she said.   The theme of the convention, ``The Next Generation: Here andNow,'' stems from the idea that Indians must control their owndestiny, Stealer said.   ``We have always talked about the future,'' she said. ``But nowwe realize it's up to us to take responsibility. That's why this isa very important conference for us.''   Stealer was unsure how many delegates would attend, but she saidpast years' conventions have drawn between 1,000 and 1,500 people.   Harjo said scheduled speakers for the convention include SouthDakota Sen. Tom Daschle, U.S. Census Bureau Director John Kane, andColorado Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only Indian member ofCongress.   Discussions will be held on current litigation, the impact ofAIDS on Indian people, exploitation of Indian culture, the state ofmental health among Indians and the emergence of anti-Indian hategroups.   The National Congress of American Indians was founded in 1944.The group says it serves Indian nations and tribes comprising morethan three-fourths of the American Indian and Alaska Nativepopulations.</TEXT></DOC>
