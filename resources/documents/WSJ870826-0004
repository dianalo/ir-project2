In recent weeks, for example, readers here have heard of the banning of &quot;anti-Irish jokes&quot; in one London borough. They've learned of a book distributed in another borough called &quot;Jesse's Dream Skirt,&quot; about a little boy who challenges sexism by dressing as a girl. The British public has gotten used to enjoying such &quot;loony left&quot; stories as part of its regular newspaper diet. But there's an ugly side to what's going on in local government that deserves closer attention.    Local government is important because it is the most significant vehicle of Marxist-leaning thought in Britain. It is more dangerous than the unions, the traditional object of right-wing attack. Mrs. Thatcher's trouncing of Labor leader Neil Kinnock in the recent national elections showed that the British people have gone a long way toward returning to pragmatic values. But this return continues to be hindered by the left-dominated city, town and shire councils, where violence, intimidation, bribery, nepotism and Tammany Hall politics characterize daily life.    The councils were created to play the same role in government as American city and county governments. They were designed to administer and carry out the mundane tasks that keep a city or county moving: garbage collection, street lighting, etc. But Britain's left wing, which dominates in cities, has more or less coopted the councils, giving them political purposes outside their mandate.    Prime Minister Thatcher's Tory government has taken steps to halt this co-optation, including the abolition of one of the worst offenders, the Greater London Council. Because it would be wrong to dismantle local government altogether, the next step is to expose these governments to the voters for what they are and return them to their proper function: servants of Parliament.    The best way to understand the insidious side of the loony left is to look at the policies behind the humorous headlines. The banning of Irish jokes, a seemingly innocuous gesture, provides a good example. In the case of the London boroughs, the banning is only one part of a regular liaison with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. Some local governments use the banners of &quot;anti-racism&quot; and &quot;anti-sexism&quot; as justification for the persecution of those who advocate any degree of immigration control or sexual differentiation. The victims are often total innocents. Take the case of nursery-school headmistress Maureen McGoldrick. In the London borough of Brent, she was effectively hounded from her job on trumped up charges of racism.    &quot;Toleration of homosexuals&quot; becomes the classroom promotion of perversion. In the &quot;Positive Images&quot; program at Haringey, homosexual groups are brought before schoolchildren as normal and good examples.    The defense of labor and labor's rights are similarly abused. &quot;Trade-union solidarity&quot; descends into the squalor of the Nye Bevan Lodge Scandal. That was the case of a local old people's home in South London, which was used by councilors and trade-union officials -- all associated with the Labor Party -- for alcoholic parties while the inmates suffered documented neglect. It seems as if every Briton familiar with his country's local government can tell stories of violence and corruption, of dangerous extremism -- from Liverpool to Lambeth and Brighton to Brent.    One of the main agents causing the problems is an extreme left-wing group called Labor Briefing. Labor Briefing shares few of the moderate, social-democratic qualities of Labor as foreigners know it: It has pledged to &quot;smash the system.&quot; In last year's local council elections in London, 100 out of 913 Labor candidates were supporters of Labor Briefing. Neil Kinnock might have seemed radical when he called for the abandonment of a nuclear defense by Britain in this spring's elections. But his goals fell far short of Labor Briefing's, which include disbanding the army and police force and replacing them with an &quot;armed workers' militia.&quot;    The group also advocates abolishing the monarchy and the judiciary, and going beyond &quot;parliamentary (read: democratic) politics to mobilize in mass actions to challenge, combat and break the capitalist state.&quot; The &quot;trappings of bourgeois society,&quot; according to Labor Briefing's plans, will be replaced by the &quot;machinery of class rule.&quot; A part of this revolution by stealth is to be achieved by destroying the &quot;tenets of bourgeois morality&quot; through support of male homosexuals and lesbians.    One Labor Briefing-dominated council has even gone as far as to ban the use of the word &quot;family&quot; in council documents. Others have set about borrowing money against municipal property, such as town halls, to finance their activities. According to financial reports by the Department of the Environment, the national agency responsible for overseeing such local government bodies, local councils have amassed loans of up to #5 billion in this way. This deliberate escalation of debt to Third World proportions is part of a stated Labor Briefing plan to &quot;take on&quot; international finance.    The classic Trotskyist analysis applied here sees the council battle as part of the international class struggle, part of a front that includes countries like Cuba. And Labor Briefing is only one of the far-left factions-another is called Militant Tendency-that operate within the British Labor Party in this way.    To be sure, the councils are duly elected bodies of British government. But their structure means they are particularly vulnerable to Putsch-style domination. Voter turnout in council elections is lowone Southwark ward polling recently pulled in only 16% of the electorate -- making them an easy victory for extremist elements. Too, the local governments lack many of the characteristics of truly democratic structures. Their financing, for example, comes largely from property taxes on business, which generally opposes them.    The imminent disintegration of local government in London is, therefore, neither funny, nor loony, nor accidental. It is a coordinated attack, a fight against a democratic system that has rejected Marxist ideas again and again. It is an attempt to destroy the state by turning part of the state against itself. Its aim is to spread confusion, to undermine institutions and to alienate ordinary people from legitimate authority.    The best solution here is to limit the spending power of these organs of the national government. Mrs. Thatcher should declare council expenditures on all partisan political activity and campaigning to be outside the realm of council power. Then the councils could return to their regular function: maintaining daily life in neighborhoods and towns. Any failure to provide these services should also be made illegal, and the personal financial liability of councilors should be established as a principle. Local government in Britain should be returned to the constitutional cage, where it can't escape.    ---   Mr. Chambers is director of the Campaign Against Council Corruption, a private group funded by business. </TEXT></DOC>
