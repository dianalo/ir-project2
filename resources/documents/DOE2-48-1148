<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-1148 </DOCNO><TEXT>A stereoscopic digital subtraction angiographic system has been developedutilizing twin focal spot x-ray tube and a single screen polarizing display.The x-ray tube is grid switched to allow for imaging speeds of up tofive frames per second. The system uses an image processor capable ofstereoscopic subtraction angiography on a 512/sup 2/ matrix. The displaysystem is a 525-line monitor using liquid crystal shutters to give aflicker-free stereoscopic image. To view the image the operator wearsa lightweight pair of polarized lenses. The clinical images from thisprototype system have the same resolution as conventional digital subtractionangiography.</TEXT></DOC>
