The treaty, which concludes seven months of bargaining,provides that the World War II allies -- the U.S., the SovietUnion, Britain and France -- will restore to Germany the fullsovereignty it lost in 1945. The united Germany will be inthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but no non-GermanNATO forces will be stationed permanently on the territory ofthe former East German state.</LP><TEXT>   The treaty also declares that the united Germany &quot;has noterritorial claims whatsoever against other states&quot; and &quot;willnever disturb the peaceful relations between nations.&quot;   The seven-page treaty was made possible by a sideagreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union. Underit, Bonn will provide billions of dollars in aid to Moscowand help build housing in the U.S.S.R. for the nearly 400,000Soviet troops that will leave German territory by the end of1994 as a result of the German unity treaty.   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told Soviet reportersthe German aid will total nearly $10 billion. The figure wasworked out in the past few days, after Moscow unexpectedlyraised its financial demands sharply.   Now that the unity treaty is signed, the two Germanys canproceed as planned with a separate internal pact and declarethemselves a single state.   Two important issues related to the new treaty remainunresolved. Secretary of State James Baker will continuenegotiating with Soviet officials today over a Soviet demandthat the U.S. separately agree to limit its troop deploymentsin Europe to well below 100,000, compared with more than300,000 now. Mr. Baker also is negotiating with Senateleaders about whether the unity pact will have to be ratifiedby the Senate.   Under the treaty, Germany will limit its armed forces to370,000 troops, down from nearly 500,000 now, and it pledgesnever to acquire nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.United Germany also will sign a treaty with Polandguaranteeing their current border.   The treaty erases the military and political arrangementsput in place after World War II, and it formally eliminatesSoviet control established by Joseph Stalin over EastGermany.   Mr. Gorbachev presided over the treaty signing at a hotelbuilt for Communist Party leaders here. He was praised forencouraging reforms in East Germany and allowing the openingof the Berlin Wall. &quot;We have drawn the line under World WarII,&quot; declared Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.&quot;We are now dealing with a new Germany that has drawn itslessons from history.&quot;   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said,&quot;This is a day of joy and jubilation,&quot; but he also recalledthe victims of Nazi Germany. &quot;In this hour, we remember thevictims of war and totalitarian domination,&quot; he said. &quot;We areparticularly thinking about the Jewish people. We would notwant their agony to ever be repeated.&quot;   For his part, Secretary Baker hailed &quot;the plain, ordinarypeople who breached the wall and tore asunder the IronCurtain.&quot;   Last-minute disputes were still being resolved two hoursbefore the signing. Mr. Baker was awakened in the middle ofthe night when Mr. Genscher appeared at his hotel to iron outlanguage covering NATO troops on German soil.   In the pact, the Soviet Union agreed to let Germany decidewhen and how U.S. and other NATO troops based in thecountry's western half can &quot;deploy&quot; temporarily to theeastern half for maneuvers. Germany pledged to protect Sovietwar monuments, to consult Moscow about honoring East Germancontracts and to bar Nazism.   The pact calls for total Soviet withdrawal from Germanyover four years, but it allows the U.S. to keep as manytroops on German soil as Washington and Bonn jointly want. Anearlier, separate agreement between the U.S. and the SovietUnion, which permitted each side 195,000 troops in centralEurope, has been junked as obsolete in light of the Sovietexit.   Moscow privately has been pressing Washington to declarepublicly a new unilateral U.S. troop ceiling of well below100,000. But the U.S. has resisted, wanting to keep a freehand and telling Moscow that Congress won't permit as many as195,000 U.S. troops in Central Europe anyway.   Still, the Soviets want such a limit on U.S. troops toquell political concerns here over a separate conventionalarms-control treaty, which would cut each side's arsenal oftanks, artillery pieces and other weapons. Mr. Baker willdiscuss the matter today with Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.Gorbachev. The Bush administration is still debating what todo.   At Soviet insistence, the U.S. agreed to call the Germanunity pact a &quot;treaty,&quot; rather than giving it the less augusttitle of &quot;agreement.&quot; But the administration still arguesthat the pact needn't be ratified by the Senate. Senateleaders disagree, and Mr. Baker spent time on the telephoneto Capitol Hill trying to iron out the issue.   Because ratification in each nation takes time, the formaltermination of the World War II victors' rights and fullrestoration of German sovereignty could be delayed past theOct. 3 unification date.   To avoid that delay, the four allies agreed to sign aseparate agreement in New York Oct. 1 suspending their legalrights over Germany. As a result, the nation will be fullysovereign when it unifies Oct. 3, even before the alliedrights are terminated.</TEXT></DOC>
