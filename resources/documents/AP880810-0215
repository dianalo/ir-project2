All official American personnel and their dependents _ a totalof 154 people _ are safe at their homes, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleysaid.   She said the United States deplores the shooting of unarmeddemonstrators by Burmese security forces and she expressed concernabout reports that troops were seeking out groups of protesters andfiring on them.   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,D-N.Y., introduced a resolution condemning the killings and massarrests by the Burmese army and supporting an end to one-party rulein Burma.   The measure, which will probably be voted on by the Senate laterthis week, also urges President Reagan to raise the question ofhuman rights abuses with Burmese authorities.   Mrs. Oakley was unable to say when the Rangoon embassy wasclosed, but she said there is no indication that Americans or otherforeigners have been or might become targets of violence.   Widespread anti-government demonstrations erupted last monthafter the appointment as president of a military commander who hadbeen accused by students and others of ruthless suppression ofdissent.   Mrs. Oakley said an official U.S. notice urging Americans toexercise caution in Burma remains in effect. It calls on Americanstraveling to that Asian country to seek information from the StateDepartment or U.S. diplomatic posts to inquire about currentconditions there. There are normally about 80 American visitors toBurma at any given time.   The spokeswoman said the ``casualty numbers appearsubstantial,'' citing Burmese government reports of 33 dead and 59wounded. Some of the casualties apparently were members of the armyand security forces.   On Tuesday, Mrs. Oakley said, a U.S. Embassy officer driving towork became trapped in a demonstration. After a bullet struck hiscar, demonstrators loaded wounded protesters into the vehicle andthe officer was forced to drive them to a safe location. He leftthe scene unharmed, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
