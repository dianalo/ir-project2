About $200 million of long-term debt is affected. Sandamp;P's move follows an announcement by the Cincinnati-based retailer that it may sell one or more of its major business units. The company's footwear, women's apparel and LensCrafter optical retail businesses are all being considered for possible divestiture. Sandamp;P said proceeds from any asset sales would probably be used to fund share buy-backs or special dividends, which would increase leverage and reduce cash flow. U.S. Shoe said Sandamp;P's move was expected. &quot;We see it as standard operating procedure,&quot; the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
