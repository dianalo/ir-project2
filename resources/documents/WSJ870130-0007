The rise followed a revised 5.1% increase in November that included a jump in military orders. The November advance was previously reported as 5.5%. Excluding defense, orders rose 6.9% last month after falling 0.1% in November.    For all of 1986, orders for durable goods, which are designed to last three years or more, rose 1.5% after increasing 3.7% in 1985. The durable-goods figures aren't adjusted for inflation, although the monthly statistics are adjusted for seasonal variations.    Separately, a Labor Department report showed that the price of imports excluding fuel increased 0.6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the rise for the year to 8.4%. These prices rose 2.9% in the third quarter and 0.8% in 1985.    The sharp rise last year largely reflected price increases in response to the decline of the dollar against major currencies in foreign-exchange trading, the department said. So far, however, the dollar's drop hasn't led to improvement in the nation's merchandise trade deficit, which swelled to a record $19.22 billion in November. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the December trade balance today.    Economists generally called the orders report a sign of strength, but many questioned whether it could be sustained in the current quarter. &quot;This is consistent with suggestions of a pickup in economic activity in December,&quot; said Martin Maruo, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York. &quot;But there aren't any convincing signs that a strong pace of growth will be sustained in the first quarter.&quot; He said income growth has been sluggish lately.    Robert Ortner, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, called the report &quot;not bad at all,&quot; adding that he'd &quot;like to see a few more like it in the next few months.&quot; He said he was particularly encouraged by the gain in orders for nondefense capital goods, an important barometer of business investment. Those orders rose 5.5% last month after a 5.7% gain in November.    Mr. Ortner acknowledged, however, that some of the strength may have reflected efforts to purchase equipment before depreciation changes took effect Jan. 1 under the new tax law.    Orders for defense capital goods fell 55.4% after a 107.1% leap in November. The department said orders for military aircraft plunged in December after a surge in November.    Transportation equipment orders declined 0.2% last month after a 15.8% increase in November. The department said a rise in motor vehicles and parts offset a drop in defense aircraft and parts. Orders for machinery gained 0.7% after a 4.3% rise. In this category, a big rise in orders for electrical machinery more than offset a drop in bookings for nonelectrical gear.    A 13.1% rise in primary metals followed three months of decline. Orders for household durables fell 5.3%; they were unchanged in November.    The December rise in orders brought them to $109.85 billion from $108.83 billion in November.    Shipments of durable goods rose 4.9% in December to $111.86 billion after declining 0.7% in November to $106.67 billion. The December rise in shipments was the biggest since they increased 5.8% in January 1983. Several economists, pointing to the strong rise in motor vehicles and parts, suggested that the December increase may reflect a push to buy cars before the repeal of the sales-tax deduction took effect Jan. 1. For the year, shipments were up 2.1% after rising 5.3% in 1985.    The backlog of orders fell 0.6% in December to $353.77 billion after a 0.6% rise in November to $355.78 billion. For the year, the backlog rose 0.2% after a 2.2% increase in 1985.    The import prices report underscored the plunge in oil prices last year. The price of fuels and related products dropped 51.5% in 1986, despite a 14.3% rise in the fourth quarter that followed price-setting agreements by oil-producing nations.    Overall, import prices including fuel rose 2.5% in the fourth quarter and fell 8.7% for the year. Export prices increased 1.2% in the fourth quarter and fell 0.5% for the year. </TEXT></DOC>
