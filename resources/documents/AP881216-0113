The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were builtat a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million units lastmonth, up 1.4 percent from the October rate of 1.54 million.   It was the third increase in a row and the highest level ofconstruction activity since April. Housing starts soared 5.1 percentin October and rose 0.4 percent in September.   Housing permits, a good barometer of future housing activity,edged up 0.1 percent to a rate of 1.52 million units, the highestlevel since June 1987. The slight gain followed a robust 8.8 percentincrease in October.   The strength surprised analysts, who for many months have beensaying that rising interest rates would dampen the housing sector.Activity this year is down from last year, but not by as much asexpected.   ``Home buyers are simply either ignoring or looking through allthe uncertainty that surrounds interest rates ... and saying, `Hey,I've got a job, things look pretty good, my company is growing, it'stime to buy a house,''' said James Christian, chief economist of theU.S. League of Savings Institutions.   He cited an unemployment rate near 14-year lows and strong salesof new homes from June through October, which pushed the backlog ofunsold homes below a six-month supply for the first time in a yearand a half.   ``Builders are going to build them if people are going to buythem,'' he said.   Nevertheless, economists say mortgage rates will probably edgehigher through the middle of next year and will eventually taketheir toll on housing. A higher rate increases monthly mortgagepayments.   Rates on fixed-rate mortgages, which fell from about 10} percentin mid-August to 10[ percent in late October, have since climbedback to nearly 10{ percent, according to the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp.   ``The housing industry is clearly slowing down. ... There aresome areas of the country still doing fairly well, but others haveslowed significantly,'' said Kent Colton, executive vice presidentof the National Association of Home Builders.   He predicted housing starts would total 1.5 million this year,down from 1.62 million last year and a recent peak of 1.81 millionin 1986. Next year, they will head still lower, to about 1.37million, he said.   For the first 11 months of the year, starts were running 9.1percent behind the same period of last year.   Single-family homes in November were built at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 1.15 million units, the highest since Marchand up 0.8 percent from a month earlier. Single-family starts shotup 9.3 percent in October.   Apartment construction, a volatile subcategory, rose 3.0 percentlast month to 412,000 units after a 5.2 percent decline in October.Because of high vacancy rates and less favorable tax treatment ofreal estate investment, apartment starts are running far below their1986 peak of 669,000 units.   By region, housing starts shot up 12.9 percent in the Northeastto 228,000 units. They rose 4.8 percent in the South to 612,000units, the highest rate in a year. Starts dropped 8.3 percent in theMiddle West and fell 2.2 percent in the West.   Housing activity has been strong in California in recent monthsbecause of brisk population growth and weak in the Northeast, partlybecause of high prices.</TEXT></DOC>
