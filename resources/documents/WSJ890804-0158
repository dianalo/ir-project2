With the increase in white-collar and financial crime cases during the past decade, the use of search warrants on law offices is on the rise. While still relatively rare, such forays into law firms trouble many attorneys who worry clients' rights are evaporating.    &quot;There is growing concern about compromising the attorney-client privilege through search warrants over the past eight to 10 years,&quot; says Harvey Silverglate, co-chairman of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. &quot;A search warrant is a very blunt instrument.&quot;    The ruling was on a case in 1985, when federal agents executed a search warrant on the law offices of Console, Marmero, Livolsi, Wood andamp; Curcio in Berlin, N.J., seizing some 420 files related to personal-injury cases. The targets of the case weren't the clients but the lawyers themselves.    U.S. District Court Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez originally ruled that the search warrant was too broad and ordered that the records be returned to the firm. That decision was overruled by the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.    The appeals panel based its ruling on the &quot;crime-fraud exception&quot; to the attorney-client privilege. The long-standing exception eliminates the privilege when an attorney is involved in the crime. To limit the erosion of the attorney-client privilege, the appeals panel said the district judge should consider excluding any records that may not be pertinent to the government's investigation.    &quot;The attorney-client privilege belongs solely to the client,&quot; says Marion Percell, an assistant U.S. attorney who handled the government's appeal. &quot;While the privilege is very valuable, it isn't reasonable to use it to protect an attorney who is perpetrating a crime or a fraud.&quot;    Two of the firm's lawyers, along with a physician and other individuals, were indicted in April by a federal grand jury in Newark, N.J., on charges of conspiracy, racketeering and mail fraud. Philip J. Livolsi and Edward C. Curcio were accused of scheming to inflate their clients' medical injuries and treatment to defraud insurance companies. They have pleaded innocent to the charges.    Michael R. Perle, an attorney for the law firm, said, &quot;It's kind of a mixed decision, but we're gratified that the process we felt should be in place {to review the records} will be followed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
