SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Army announced Thursday that its fleet ofAH-64 attack helicopters could begin flying again after aninvestigation showed a fatal accident last week was caused by apiece of improperly stored sheet metal striking the tail rotor.   The Army has 486 Apaches, its newest and most sophisticatedhelicopter gunship.   The fleet was grounded Monday for the investigation into the June29 crash in northern Florida of a National Guard Apache. Theco-pilot was killed and the pilot seriously injured when the tailrotor came off the helicopter.   In a statement at the Pentagon, the Army said the investigationinto the Florida crash revealed that the tail rotor damage wascaused by ``a foreign object striking a rotor blade.''   Physical and chemical evidence found that a piece of sheet metalused to help secure a door had been improperly stored and that thepiece of metal ``became dislodged and flew into the AH-64's tailrotor system,'' the statement said.   Army spokesman Lt. Col. John Chapla said the rectangular piece ofmetal is about six to eight inches long and is supposed to besecurely stored during flight.   ``It blew free and struck the rotor,'' Chapla said.   The investigation was conducted at the Army Safety Center in FortRucker, Ala.   The Apache fleet was last grounded in August 1987 wheninvestigators studied the failure of one component of the tailrotor. It was also grounded twice in 1986 for relatively minorproblems.   The choppers, built by McDonnel Douglas Corp., cost roughly $13million each.   The Army's fleet was dealt a blow last month after dozens wereput out of service because of damage they suffered during a freakwind storm at Fort Hood, Texas.   The gunship is designed to replace the Cobra helicopter as theArmy's primary attack helicopter. The twin-engined machine, which isdesigned to destroy enemy tanks, carries Hellfire and Hydra 7missiles and a 30mm cannon.</TEXT></DOC>
