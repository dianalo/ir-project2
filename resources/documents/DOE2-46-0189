A one-dimensional numericaldynamic model (0 to 80 km) and a global three-dimensional circulationmodel of the stratosphere (10 to 150 km) are used. Particular interestis taken in the propagation of disturbances in atmospheric strata belowthe level at which they are generated. The one-dimensional model is usedfor investigating general aspects of vertical wind disturbance propagationin a given stratum, either upward or downward. In the three-dimensionalmodel, fluctuations in solar UV radiation resulting from the rotationof the sun induce significant temperature variations in the ozone layerin a zonal wind field of reduced stability. The temperature fluctuations,in turn, have a global effect on atmospheric circulation as a resultof nonlinear wave-to-wave interactions.</TEXT></DOC>
