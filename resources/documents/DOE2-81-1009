Configuration with an additional H protonover the face in the pole range of the B/sub 10/H/sub 10/ polyhedronis found to be most profitable. Structures with H/sup +/ above the polerib and with BH/sub 2/-group in the pole of the polyhedron comply withvertices of small migration barriers ({similar_to} 4 and {similar_to}1 kcal respectively). At rather low temperatures the additional protonis ''smeared'' above the pole range of the polyhedron B/sub 10/H/sub10/. The mechanism of migration with proton exchange via BH/sub 2/-groupformation is preferrable. Migration through the equatorial range requiresessential energy consumption (h/sub migr/ makes up 16 kcal). Geometricaldeformation, polarization of the electron density and disintegrationof degenrated energy levels of the anion B/sub 10/H/sub 10//sup 2-/ underthe effect of H/sup +/ are studied.</TEXT></DOC>
