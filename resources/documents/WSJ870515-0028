Col. Oliver North painted a colorful and detailed picture of how the fired White House aide provided clandestine military advice, money and munitions to the Nicaraguan Contras.    Conservative activist Robert Owen testified before congressional investigative committees that he served as a frequent &quot;courier&quot; between Col. North and the top leaders of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the main Contra group. Appearing under a grant of limited immunity, Mr. Owen said he carried military intelligence -- reportedly obtained by Col. North from the Central Intelligence Agency -- to Central America, and made cash payments to Contra leaders during meetings in his car or apartment in the Washington area.    Mr. Owen also said that during early 1985 he and White House aide Johnathan Miller, then a State Department official temporarily assigned to Col. North, cashed thousands of dollars in traveler's checks from Col. North's safe, and gave the money to Contra leaders at surreptitious meetings.    Minutes after Mr. Owen named him in testimony, Mr. Miller resigned as deputy assistant to the president for administration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Miller voluntarily resigned the post, which included responsibility for managing White House facilities. Mr. Fitzwater said the White House only learned of Mr. Miller's involvement in handling the money on Tuesday.    Also yesterday, Gaston Sigur, a former National Security Council aide, testified that he helped arrange meetings for Col. North with representatives of foreign countries from whom Col. North sought assistance for the Contras. At the time, Congress had banned U.S. military aid to the insurgents. Mr. Sigur currently is assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs.    Investigators identified the nations as Taiwan, South Korea and China. A $2 million contribution from Taiwan later was funneled to a Swiss account used to finance a covert airlift of military supplies. The airlift was overseen by Col. North. At the time of the contribution, Taiwan had a major stake in the administration's opposition to a textile-import bill in Congress. While Mr. Sigur denied giving Taiwan any favored treatment as a result of its Contra contribution, he admitted the trade issue was a major focus of his work at the NSC and of his dealings with the Taiwanese representative.    Documents released by House and Senate committees indicate that Col. North attempted in the meeting with representatives of China to secure Soviet-model weapons for the guerrillas. It remains unclear what, if anything, came from the contacts Mr. Sigur made with South Korea.    On two occasions, Mr. Owen told the panels, Col. North gave him photographs and maps to help support Contra military operations. Intelligence sources said Col. North had obtained the materials from the CIA with the approval of former director William Casey, who died earlier this month.    In mid-February 1985, Mr. Owen said, he met Col. North outside the White House Situation Room -- the nerve center of U.S. national security operations -- to pick up maps detailing a Nicaraguan military buildup along the Honduran border. Mr. Owen said the maps had been mounted on large sheets of poster board. Col. North, he said, had &quot;a few choice words&quot; about the maps, then called intelligence officials and ordered new ones that could be carried surreptitiously to Central America.    On a rainy night in April 1985, Mr. Owen said, he stood on the sidewalk outside the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House, and handed an envelope of cash to a Nicaraguan Indian leader through the window of a passing car. On other occasions, he said, he delivered thousands of dollars to another Indian leader, identified by congressional sources as Brooklyn Rivera, in an effort to encourage him to halt negotiations with the Nicaraguan government, and to join a Contra force based in Costa Rica.    Congressional sources said the traveler's checks Messrs. Owen and Miller cashed were bought with money deposited by Saudi Arabia in banks accounts controlled by Contra leader Adolfo Calero, who forwarded them to Col. North. Investigators said Mr. Owen's testimony clearly indicated that Col. North controlled funds for the insurgents at a time when U.S. aid to them was prohibited.    The committee also introduced a February 1985 letter from Col. North, code-named &quot;Steelhammer,&quot; to Mr. Calero, who was code-named &quot;Sparkplug,&quot; notifying the Contra leader that &quot;next week, a sum in excess of $20M (million) will be deposited in the usual account.&quot; The letter was written shortly after Saudi Arabia's King Fahd told President Reagan his country would increase its contributions to the Contras.    In the letter, Col. North also proposed a number of military steps, including hiring a British special operations veteran whom Col. North said he could &quot;produce.&quot; Mr. Owen told the panels that he believed the Briton, who has separately been identified as David Walker, had conducted &quot;sabotage work&quot; in Managua, but that hasn't been confirmed independently.    Mr. Owen said he called Col. North &quot;the quartermaster of the Contras,&quot; and described how he delivered &quot;wish lists&quot; of military equipment from Contra leaders to the White House official. The panels produced a July 2, 1984, letter from Mr. Owen to Col. North, referring to efforts to obtain &quot;toys&quot; and &quot;firecrackers&quot; for the Contras. Both terms, Mr. Owen said, meant arms. The letter was found in Col. North's office by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    Conservative fund-raiser Carl &quot;Spitz&quot; Channell later adopted the terminology, setting up a &quot;Toys Project.&quot; Mr. Channell has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the government by using a tax-exempt foundation to raise funds to buy weapons for the Contras.    Mr. Owen, a former State Department consultant, also testified that Col. North reviewed Contra weapons requests with Mr. Calero at a time when retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub was assembling a $5 million purchase for the insurgents. Col. North, Mr. Owen said, recommended that the Contras pass up a chance to buy Soviet-made, SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles through Gen. Singlaub, and said he was trying to locate British-made Blowpipe missiles instead.    Mr. Sigur insisted that Col. North had acted with authority from above. &quot;I never thought for a minute that he was doing anything on his own,&quot; said Mr. Sigur, who joined the State Department in 1986.    The new disclosures came after the committees completed almost four days of testimony from Robert McFarlane, the former National Security Council adviser whose tenure corresponded with the beginnings of both the private Contra network and the Iran initiative. The former adviser has been quick to accept &quot;responsibility&quot; for errors made, but throughout this week, lawmakers were frustrated by frequent contradictions in his testimony and indications that he withheld information from Congress.    &quot;I appreciate your willingness to accept responsibility, but I cannot accept your answer,&quot; said House investigative panel chairman Lee Hamilton in a statement that silenced the hearing room. &quot;As national security adviser you were the spokesman for the president,&quot; said the Indiana Democrat. &quot;The responsibility must also rest with him.&quot;    &quot;Mr. Chairman you have indeed expressed a collective sentiment eloquently,&quot; answered Mr. McFarlane. &quot;There is no rebuttal.&quot;    Meanwhile, White House spokesman Mr. Fitzwater, while continuing to say that President Reagan never solicited aid for the Contras from other countries, flatly asserted that such solicitations wouldn't have violated the so-called &quot;Boland Amendment,&quot; the provision banning direct or indirect American military aid to the Contras.    &quot;I don't think we have ever felt it's against the law to solicit money from third countries, for humanitarian (aid) or arms,&quot; Mr. Fitzwater said. White House aides believe that by failing to be more aggressive they may have allowed a &quot;perception&quot; to build up that many activities the White House believes were well within the law were illegal. </TEXT></DOC>
