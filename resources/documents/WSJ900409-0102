The House's chief environmentalist, Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,Calif.), is promising to try to resurrect President Bush'sproposal last year to require auto makers to produce onemillion cars a year by 1997 that run on fuels, such asmethanol, that are cleaner than gasoline. Auto makers and theoil industry have succeeded in killing the requirement in theSenate and so far in the House.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Waxman says he also will propose strengthening theclean-air bill passed late Thursday by the House Energy andCommerce Committee to expand the use of reformulated gasolinein smoggy cities and of even cleaner-burning fuels such asnatural gas in centrally fueled fleets.   Mr. Waxman's proposal sets up a titanic confrontation withRep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the House's chief defender ofthe auto industry and the powerful chairman of the commercepanel. Unless the two can strike a compromise before theclean-air bill is taken up by the full House late this monthor in early May, &quot;this will be the environmental vote on theHouse floor,&quot; Mr. Waxman says.   In fact, the alternative-fuels issue is one of the few bigleague disputes left for the House following a series ofunusual bipartisan deals between Mr. Dingell and Mr. Waxman,who are traditionally enemies in clean-air issues, and othermembers of the panel.   The committee locked up compromises on the major clean-airprovisions for reducing acid rain, smog in cities, tailpipeexhaust and toxic industrial emissions. And members agreed tostick to their guns on the issues through the House debateand through arduous talks ahead with the Senate overdifferences in clean-air provisions.   &quot;Most of the major areas of controversy have been removedfrom this bill,&quot; Mr. Dingell said. Added Mr. Waxman, &quot;It'sunlikely that any of these compromises are going to bechanged on the House floor.&quot; Unlike the Senate, which cutbargains in closed-door talks with the White House beforefloor action, the Bush administration wasn't deeply involvedin House committee negotiations.   The compromises spare the House from deeply divisivefights over subsidies for socalled dirty Midwestern utilitieshardest hit by the cost of acid-rain controls and overreducing cancer deaths from factory fumes even at the expenseof closing plants.   Mr. Dingell and Republican House members who are concernedabout the economic costs of the legislation, whose price tagfor industry ranges from $19 billion and $21.5 billionannually by the year 2005, accepted tougher controls onindustry than they might have liked. But in return, they'respared from even more stringent requirements that manyobservers think could have been adopted on the House floor intoday's political climate, which is charged with concern forthe environment.   Mr. Waxman said that rather than gamble on winning bigenvironmental votes on the House floor, he decided to settlefor solid solutions that stand a better chance of becominglaw because they will carry the support of key HouseRepublicans and Mr. Dingell in negotiations with the Senate.   The compromises achieved by the House also have thesurprising effect of pleasing both industry andenvironmentalists to a greater degree than a bill passed lastweek by the Senate.   Neither industry nor environmentalists are entirely happywith the House bill. But both saw the greatest improvement inthe House panel's provisions for reducing toxic factoryemissions, which are blamed for causing at least 3,000 cancerdeaths a year.   The House version &quot;removes the automatic shutdown threat{for coke ovens}, and that's why the steel industry likesit,&quot; said John Stinson, a National Steel Corp. officiallobbying for the industry. Steelmakers claim a majority ofcoke ovens would be closed under the Senate's provisions toreduce cancer risks for people living next to plants.   David Doniger, an air toxics expert with the NaturalResources Defense Council, likewise prefers the House versionover the Senate's because the House measure requires cleanupsfrom smaller sources such as dry cleaners and dropsprovisions that he says wouldn't eliminate cancer risks toplant neighbors.   The main reason the House bill is acceptable to bothsides, however, is probably that it effectively defers forseven to 10 years the most contentious issue of how to cutcancer risks that remain after industries have alreadyinstalled the best available technology. That technologywould reduce emissions 75% to 90%.   Besides alternative fuels, other unresolved issues arenarrower but still contentious. Talks on some of them couldyield compromises before full House action, lawmakers said.   Rep. Jim Bates (D., Calif.), with the support ofenvironmentalists, is expected to seek a total phase-out inthe U.S. before the year 2000 of chlorofluorocarbons,chemicals blamed for destroying the atmosphere's protectiveozone layer. The Senate has already adopted a similarprovision. There also will likely be an attempt to drawlimits on the use of certain substitute chemicals now beingdeveloped by such companies as Du Pont Co.   Two sideline issues on toxic industrial emissions arestill being debated. Environmentalists and industry willlikely take opposing views on defining the minimum amount ofcontrols that existing factories should be forced to install.Environmentalists, concerned about accidents like the deadlyrelease several years ago in Bhopal, India, are also seekingprovisions to prevent and investigate chemical accidents inthe U.S.   Also in the works are amendments to remedy pollutionproblems in national parks, to fix both small businesses' andenvironmentalists' problems with a proposed national programfor issuing operating permits to all polluters, and possiblyto lengthen warranty requirements now in the House billcovering automobile air pollution equipment.   ---   Rose Gutfeld contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
