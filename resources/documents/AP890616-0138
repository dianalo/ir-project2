Japan and Hong Kong were considered particularly critical to anyeffective reduction in ivory demand. Japan is the largest importerand consumer of ivory, accounting for 40 percent of the worldmarket. Hong Kong is heavily involved in making ivory carvings forreexport.   Conservationists estimate African elephant populations havedropped by half to two-thirds in the past decade, from 1.5 millionin 1978 to between 400,000 and 700,000 today. Ivory exports haveincreased from 300 tons a year in the 1950s to more than 800 tonsannually this decade, they say.   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said theJapanese ban will take effect Monday. It will exclude raw Africanivory specially certified under an international agreement. Suchivory accounts for about 13 percent of the imports.   Hong Kong announced a moratorium on all raw ivory imports butsaid traders and importers who had entered into contractualagreements before Friday were exempt.   Their pledges came one day after Canada said it will ban ivoryimports.   Since June 4, the United States, the 12-nation European EconomicCommunity, and Switzerland also have imposed bans on ivory imports.   ``It's been a real snowball effect,'' Jorgen Thomsen, seniorprogram officer for elephant conservation at the World WildlifeFund, said Friday.   The 102-nation Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies will consider a worldwide ban on ivory imports at a Genevameeting in October.   Conservationists feared that prospects of a worldwide ban couldlead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killing unless interimmeasures were imposed by major importing countries now.   Ivory is used for the signature stamps popular in many Asiannations, and for jewelry, piano keys and carvings.   Though some African countries still permit limited exports of thecertified ivory, four major producers _ Kenya, Tanzania, Gambia andSomalia _ have called for a total ban on trade in ivory. They saysuch action is needed to stem the swift decline in the population ofAfrican elephants.   Kenya, which banned hunting of African elephants a decade ago,last year began using police and paramilitary units its war withpoachers. An aerial survey last year found an estimated 20,000elephants remaining in Kenya, which 15 years ago had a population of121,000.   Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in somecountries and are switching to females and young beasts, accordingto a conservationists' report this month based on material frombiologists, conservationists, economists and trade specialists.   As a result, three times as many elephants must be killed toprovide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago, the report said.Most ivory is added late in life among males.   Tamotsu Ishibashi, chairman of Tokyo Ivory and Craft CooperativeAssociation, said the ban will hurt Japan's traditionalivory-carving industry.   ``The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques ofcarving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restrictioncertainly will affect them severely,'' Ishibashi said in a telephoneinterview.   About 25,000 ivory craftsman work in 80 Japanese workshops,producing $13.8 million worth of ivory products every year.</TEXT></DOC>
