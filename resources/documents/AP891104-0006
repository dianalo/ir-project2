The records show that Richard Lee Fowler, a former Boeingcompany official indicted for crimes involving illegal dealing inclassified documents, named the company as a co-conspirator.   The company is scheduled to enter a plea to an undisclosedcharge Nov. 13 in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va. No chargeshave been filed.   By entering the pre-indictment plea, Boeing will avoidindictment by the same federal grand jury that charged Fowler,according to the Morning News Tribune of Tacoma, which broke thestory on Friday.   Fowler, a senior marketing analyst for Boeing Aerospace inArlington, Va., until he was fired in 1986, was indicted in Auguston 39 felony counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and other crimesinvolving illegal dealing in classified documents.   He has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial Dec. 4.   During the internal Boeing investigation that led to his firing,Fowler told Boeing attorneys the reason he was hired by theaerospace company was to obtain such documents.   He is charged with obtaining documents such as the Pentagon'sfive-year budget plan, the main defense-spending guide used by topofficials. The document could help a contractor plan biddingschedules.   Other papers he allegedly took include those related to theStrategic Defense Initiative, for which Boeing has millions ofdollars' worth of contracts.   Fowler was a civilian budget analyst for the Air Force before hewas hired by Boeing in 1978.   Randy Bellows, the federal prosecutor on the Fowler case,declined comment Thursday when asked by the Morning News Tribuneabout Boeing's role as a co-conspirator.   Boeing spokesmen Paul Binder in Seattle declined to comment onthe case when contacted by The Associated Press, saying Boeing'spolicy is not to comment on the investigation.   Court documents in Alexandria named the company as aco-conspirator from 1979 through 1985.   If Boeing pleads guilty to a criminal charge, the Seattle-basedaerospace giant would be the second major defense contractorconvicted in the federal probe of how defense contractors obtainclassified documents giving them an advance look into thePentagon's future needs.   GTE avoided indictment by pleading guilty in 1985 to conspiringto obtain classified defense documents illegally. Two GTE employeesand a consultant were indicted on similar charges.   At the time, defense officials said the guilty plea was likelyto prevent any major actions by the Pentagon to suspend or bar GTEfrom future contracts.   It was the GTE case that apparently triggered the investigationof Boeing and Fowler, the Morning News Tribune reported.   Boeing and a number of other major defense contractors werenamed during a 1986 court hearing in the case of the GTEconsultant, Bernie Zettl, who said trafficking in classifiedPentagon documents is widespread in the defense industry. Zettl'scase has not gone to trial.</TEXT></DOC>
