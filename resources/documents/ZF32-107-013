(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By John PallattoandM;Digital Equipment Corp. recently extended its Cohesion CASE technology toallow developers to use its VAX minicomputers as software-developmentplatforms for competing vendors' hardware and operating systems.andM;Application Control Architecture (ACA) Services includes new softwareintegration and communications tools.andP;  The tools will let developers workingwith non-DEC CASE tools, on PCs, Macintoshes and Unix workstations, accessdata stored in DEC's revamped CDD/Repository, said Henry Morris, thecompany's manager of Cohesion Solutions Marketing in Nashua, N.H.andM;ACA Services will allow the integration of third-party vendor tools with DECCASE tools, Morris said.andP;  The product will let other vendors' software invokeVMS and Ultrix applications running across the network, he said.andM;Cohesion, DEC's CASE system for VAXes based on Network Application Support(NAS), is a set of software products for building and deploying applicationsacross multiple platforms.andM;&quot;Developers should think of Cohesion as a software factory for building NASapplications,&quot; Morris said.andP;  The finished applications can be deployed onvirtually every type of hardware platform, from the smallest PC to thefastest Cray supercomputer, he said.andM;One analyst said DEC is &quot;bowing to the marketplace&quot; by allowing third-partyCASE tool vendors to tie their products into Cohesion.andP;  &quot;Third-party softwaredevelopers have told DEC that they want to use DEC's CDD/Repository insteadof developing their own dictionary technology,&quot; said Peter Kastner, vicepresident with the Aberdeen Group, a market-research firm in Boston.andM;An ACA Services Developers Kit, with prices starting at $450, will be shippedin September.andM;DEC also announced CDD/Repository version 5, which has been enhanced withobject-oriented programming capabilities, Morris said.andP;  Earlier versionsstored information about data, records, fields, files and procedures.andP;  Thenew version stores information about objects, such as databases, modules ofcode, files and documentation.andM;The CDD/Repository will be available for VAX/VMS systems in November withprices ranging from $750 to $48,200, depending on hardware configuration.andP;  AnUltrix version will be shipped next February with prices ranging from $1,650to $23,350.andM;DEC also announced seven specialized CASE packages, called CohesionSolutions, including Cohesion for Rapid Development, a tool for fastprototyping of database applications.andP;  Support versions are out now; generalavailability is expected in six months.andP;  DEC can be reached at (603)884-6660.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
