Ashland Oil Inc. said its net income was flat in its latestfiscal quarter, but rose 55 percent excluding the effects ofunusual items.   The drop in the price of oil lowered the companies' profits fromexploration and production of crude oil.   However, the price drop raised their profits from products suchas gasoline, heating oil and petrochemicals by reducing the cost ofthe oil that goes into making them, Exxon and Arco said.   Sometimes prices of refined products fall in lockstep with crudeoil prices, but this time they stayed relatively firm, creatingwider profit margins for the oil companies.   Oil prices have fallen over the past year, mainly because of theinability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries torein in excess production.   Arco said its average price for domestic crude oil fell morethan $4 a barrel, to $9.62 a barrel in the third quarter from $14 abarrel a year earlier.   New York-based Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said itearned $1.26 billion, or 93 cents a share, up from $1.07 billion,or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.2 percent to$21.89 billion from $21.93 billion.   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Exxon said itsprofit rose 18 percent to $3.88 billion, or $2.89 a share, from$3.29 billion, or $2.31 a share. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $65.5billion from $61.5 billion.   Improved profit margins on refined products were made possibleby relatively firm prices for the products, combined with lowercosts for the crude oil that goes into them, Exxon said. Margins onrefining and marketing had been ``severely depressed'' a yearearlier, the company said.   However, weak crude oil prices depressed earnings fromexploration and production operations, it said.   Arco, based in Los Angeles and the eighth largest U.S. oilcompany, said its profit rose to $391 million, or $2.17 a share,from $315 million, or $1.71 a share, a year earlier. Revenue roseto $4.59 billion from $4.44 billion.   For the nine-month period, Arco said its profit rose 34.8percent to $1.19 billion, or $6.56 a share, from $884 million, or$4.82 a share. Revenue rose about 11 percent to $13.8 billion from$12.4 billion.   Arco said its after-tax earnings from oil and gas explorationand production shrank to $80 million from $235 million a yearearlier. But after-tax profits of refining and marketing rose to$121 million from $30 million a year earlier.   Profits at its Lyondell Petrochemical Co. jumped to $156 millionfrom $23 million. Arco announced separately that it was consideringselling 50 percent of Lyondell to the public in a stock offering.   Ashland, the Ashland, Ky.-based company that is the nation's14th largest oil company, said its profit in its fourth quarterended Sept. 30 was $66 million, or $1.19 a share, compared to $66million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items,net income rose 55 percent, the company said. Earnings for the fullfiscal year were $224 million, or $4.01 a share, on revenue of $8.2billion, compared with earnings of $133 million, or $2.14 a share,on revenue of $7 billion in 1987.   But the company said in the release that unusual items affectedresults for all periods, including the settlement of lawsuits byformer employees and cost overruns on fluidized bed boilers builtby a subsidiary. These and other previously announced items reducedthe fourth quarter's earnings by $25 million, or 45 cents a share,and the year's results by $28 million, or 50 cents a share.</TEXT></DOC>
