The modified regulations, first described in some detail last month by Soviet officials to Western businessmen, include inducements such as better access to the Soviet domestic market, an easier registration process for Western companies and a policy of deferred payment on profit tax, according to East-West trade experts in West Germany.    But Western experts are still uncertain about the details of the changes, especially as they relate to foreign-currency earnings. The original decree, published in January, suggested that Western companies participating in joint ventures could take profits out of the Soviet Union only if the ventures generated hard-currency earnings.    In Cologne, an official in the Soviet Trade Mission confirmed that changes to the decree had been passed by the Council of Ministers and would be given wider publicity soon. &quot;The Soviet leadership realized the necessity of making it easier to start up joint ventures,&quot; the official, Vladimir Maslow, said.    The changes reflect a trimming of Soviet expectations, trade experts said. &quot;The Soviets had invented the joint venture as an instrument for generating foreign-exchange currency,&quot; said Henning Aretz, the chief of the Soviet and Eastern European division of the West German Federation of Industry, in Cologne. &quot;This was, of course, completely unrealistic.&quot;    Mr. Aretz, who was part of an International Chamber of Commerce delegation briefed on the changes in mid-September, said Soviet officials seem aware that their original goals were too ambitious. &quot;There is a remarkable change in what the Soviets expect now from joint ventures,&quot; he said.    Even without a hard-currency windfall, the Soviets still stand to gain potentially significant benefits through exposure to Western management skills and by producing higher-quality goods for the domestic market.    Word of the changes, which has circulated among Western businessmen and East-West trade officials, hasn't yet triggered an onslaught of new business interest. Since the original decree, there have been hundreds of discussions between Soviets and interested Western companies. So far, such talks have produced 13 joint-venture contracts, none with U.S. companies.    But many experts who have followed the Soviet initiative say they are encouraged by the Soviets' apparent willingness to face up to the plan's initial shortcomings.    Moreover, East-West experts say they are glad that joint ventures are no longer seen by the Soviet Union or the West as a litmus test for mutual economic cooperation. &quot;In the beginning, both in the East and the West there was too much enthusiasm,&quot; says Jan-Peter Waehler, an expert in Soviet law at the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg, who is familiar with the changes. &quot;There seems to be more soberness on both sides now.&quot;    ---   Telefonica, Soviets in Pact   MADRID -- Cia. Telefonica Nacional de Espana said it signed an agreement under which it will participate in the construction of a plant, valued at two billion pesetas ($17.3 million), to make telephone handsets in the Soviet Union.    The Soviet Union, with a 51% stake, will control the venture. Using Spanish technology, the planned factory will produce 500,000 sets a year initially, rising to one million sets annually from the third year.    The agreement, one of the first East-West ventures in telecommunications equipment, is expected to be followed by others.    A Telefonica official said the company is also negotiating a possible contract to supply equipment for public call-boxes in Moscow. The Soviet Union also has expressed interest in joint development of transmission equipment for communications from the Soviet Union to the Americas and Africa, he said.    Separately, Telefonica officials said the company is reconsidering plans to raise 66.5 billion pesetas through a 1-for-10 rights issue following the sharp falls in share prices on international stock exchanges.    The rights issue, announced earlier this month to help finance Telefonica's investment program, was to start Nov. 7 and involve the sale of new shares at 800 pesetas a share.    But Telefonica shares have fallen sharply over the past few days, closing yesterday at 745 pesetas, down from 836.25 pesetas Friday. Officials said a board meeting tomorrow would consider whether to go ahead or change the plan, possibly switching to a bond issue. </TEXT></DOC>
