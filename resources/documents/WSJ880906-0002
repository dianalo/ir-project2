Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT FIN F </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it reached agreement for Robert M. Bass Group Inc. to acquire American Savings andamp; Loan Association, Stockton, Calif., the nation's biggest insolvent thrift, with about $2 billion in federal assistance.    The transaction, which still requires approval from the Internal Revenue Service and California thrift regulators before it can be completed, would resolve the Bank Board's single biggest headache. The $2 billion in aid, which includes a note of about $500 million, indicates that the transaction is the most costly resolution ever of a single failed thrift.    The Bass Group, of Fort Worth, Texas, will inject $550 million of new capital into American Savings, which is the main unit of Financial Corp. of America, based in Irvine, Calif. The Bank Board didn't indicate whether Financial Corp. or its shareholders or debtholders will be compensated for American Savings after ownership of the thrift is transferred to the Bass Group.    Last night, a Financial Corp. spokeswoman declined to comment on the Bank Board's announcement.    The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., an arm of the Bank Board that will provide the financial assistance to the Bass group, will receive warrants equal to a 30% interest in the recapitalized American Savings. In addition, the FSLIC will receive 75% of the substantial tax benefits available to American Savings.    The Bank Board's announcement yesterday didn't mention one aspect of the transaction that has drawn some congressional criticism. The agreement apparently will allow Bass Group to invest $1.5 billion of American Savings' funds in leveraged buy-out transactions or other merchant banking activities.    Currently, American Savings is the nation's second-largest thrift when ranked by its assets of $30 billion. It has about $15 billion in deposits, all of which have been guaranteed to their full amounts under a special Bank Board order.    The transaction represents a major victory for Bass Group, which is the main investment vehicle of Robert Bass, a publicity-shy 40-year-old billionaire who in recent years has become increasingly active in corporate acquisitions.    Bass Group currently is pressing a $1.75 billion hostile tender offer for Macmillan Inc., the New York publishing and information company that also is being courted by Maxwell Communication Corp., London.    A Bass Group spokesman declined to comment.    For the Bank Board, a successful resolution of American Savings' troubles would bring an end to more than four years of difficulty with the thrift. The last major crisis in American Savings's history came in August 1984, when the Securities and Exchange Commission forced Financial Corp. to restate its reported second-quarter 1984 profit as a $107.5 million loss, touching off a $6.8 billion deposit run.    The Bank Board then replaced Financial Corp.'s aggressive and flamboyant chairman, Charles W. Knapp, with William J. Popejoy, a veteran California thrift executive and former Bank Board official.    The agreement between the Bank Board and Bass group also represents a defeat for Ford Motor Co., which has for more than a year been trying to strike a deal with the Bank Board to acquire American Savings. Ford's own big thrift unit, First Nationwide Bank, is based in San Francisco, but its California branch network is relatively small. American Savings's 185 branches would have meant a major expansion.    Last week, Ford mounted a strong but last-minute lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill, aimed at pressuring the Bank Board into reopening talks with Ford.    Negotiations between the Bank Board and Ford ended last April, when the Bank Board signed a 75-day exclusive negotiating agreement with Bass Group. The agreement was extended twice, with a final deadline of last Friday.    During the final hours of negotiation last week, there were several points at which there were serious doubts the two sides could reach agreement, according to officials familiar with the negotiations.    At one point Friday morning, officials familiar with the discussions said the talks had collapsed, although a spokesman for the Bank Board said at the time that there was merely a &quot;break in the negotiations.&quot;    In the final two days of negotiations, Bass Group agreed to give up future tax benefits that the Bank Board valued at about $160 million, according to officials familiar with the talks. Although no other significant economic terms of the transaction changed in the final discussions, the Bank Board staff spent several hours recalculating its estimate of the cost of the transaction to the FSLIC.    Stuart D. Root, executive director of the FSLIC, said in a statement last night: &quot;These have been long and exhaustive negotiations, and there were times when it appeared we might have reached an impasse. However, we were always able to work out the problem and continue on toward an equitable agreement.&quot;    In its statement last night, the Bank Board said it anticipates that the transaction will be completed &quot;promptly,&quot; but didn't give a specific time estimate.    &quot;Obviously, we are pleased that our largest single insolvent thrift will be successfully resolved through acquisition,&quot; said M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Bank Board.    &quot;Furthermore, it is important that the acquirer, who is new to the thrift industry, is bringing in so much new capital and that the entry of a new player into the business helps preserve the competitiveness of the California thrift industry,&quot; Mr. Wall said in a statement.    In his statement, Mr. Wall tried to defuse some of the criticism of the Bass Group transaction that has been building in Congress. &quot;Our agreement with Mr. Bass is a fair one to the Bank Board, the FSLIC, American Savings and the Bass Group itself,&quot; Mr. Wall said.    Mr. Wall also contended that the transaction's &quot;cost to the FSLIC is far from a record. Because the negative net worth was greater for some of the Texas institutions we have dealt with, the cost there has been higher on at least three occasions.&quot;    However, the thrift rescues in Texas where the total estimated cost to the FSLIC has exceeded $2 billion involved more than one institution.    Immediately after the Bank Board's announcement, there were indications that the board's agreement with Bass Group won't put an end to questions about the board's handling of the American Savings transaction.    Fernand J. St Germain, chairman of the House Banking Committee, issued a statement late yesterday saying that his panel &quot;will explore fully&quot; the Bank Board's decision to accept the Bass Group's offer.    &quot;This is one of the biggest outlays of assistance monies in the history of the FSLIC and it is essential that the Congress and the public understand all aspects of the deal and the criteria on which the Bass offer was accepted,&quot; Rep. St Germain (D., R.I.) said. Rep. St Germain said the banking panel is asking for all background data on the offer from Bass and Ford. In addition, he said, &quot;the committee will want to determine in greater detail what led to the need for the massive assistance and what regulatory steps were taken by the Bank Board in an effort to prevent the institution from becoming an assistance candidate.&quot;    Roger Martin, the Bank Board member who handled earlier discussions with Ford and the Bass Group, also tried to address similar concerns in his statement about the agreement. &quot;We began negotiating with the Bass people on an exclusive basis because their formal offer was the best we had at the time. I am confident our agreement based on that offer will stand up to any scrutiny.&quot;    American Savings, with branches throughout California, has about one million deposit accounts and currently employs about 5,500 people. The Bank Board said yesterday that assurances it previously extended to depositors, general creditors and certain lenders and securities dealers who do business with American Savings will remain in force.
