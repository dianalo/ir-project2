(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson, the former televisionevangelist who failed to turn the fervent support of his``invisible army'' into a significant share of Republican votes,was formally ending his presidential bid today.   At the outset of the 1988 presidential race, Robertson was awild card.   The Republican establishment nervously eyed his evangelicalfollowers and his hefty warchest and wondered what kind of ashowing he might make. Since many Robertson supporters were new tothe political process, his potential impact was difficult to gauge.   In the end, Robertson spent $22 million and gained only 46delegates to the Republican National Convention.   Robertson set the stage for his departure last week by endorsingthe Republican nominee-to-be, George Bush, who already has amathematical lock on the nomination.   He was holding a press conference today at his home to makeofficial what has been clear to observers for months _ thatRobertson is not in contention for the Republican presidentialnomination.   The former television evangelist was expected to hang onto hisdelegates until the convention, then release them to Bush on thefirst ballot.   The high point of the Robertson campaign came early on _ theFeb. 8 Iowa caucuses, where he beat out Bush for second place,behind Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.   But in the next big battle _ the New Hampshire primary _Robertson finished behind not only Bush and Dole, but also behindNew York Rep. Jack Kemp and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.   Even then, Robertson gave every indication that he expected tomake a comeback in the South, with its March 8 mega-primary.   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he told his supporters after thedisappointing showing in New Hampshire, ``tomorrow I go into theSouth, and then we are going to be playing in my own backyard.''   His backyard proved an unfriendly place. In the Southernprimaries, he finished no better than second place _ in Texas _ andwas third in his home state of Virginia.   Robertson continued to do well in the caucus states, winning inHawaii, Nevada, Washington and Alaska, and doing well in Minnesotaand Alaska.   But by mid-March Robertson was no longer even competing instates with primaries. He concentrated his scaled-down campaign onthe caucuses, started talking about 1992, and about making his markat the Republican National Convention in New Orleans this summer.   ``I am the true conservative candidate and I will bring thatvoice to the convention,'' he said. Robertson said he hoped toshape the party's platform, bringing it in line with hisconservative views.   ``I want a platform like the 1984 platform _ for school prayer,against abortion, for family values,'' he said.   The Robertson campaign was not without its other-worldly moments.   On Easter Sunday, Robertson told a Denver congregation hispresidential bid was divinely inspired.   ``There is an enterprise the Lord set me on a year or so ago _running for president,'' he said. And it wasn't over yet, he toldthe faithful.   ``Out of what seems to be a defeat we are laying a foundationfor a great victory for this nation. It may not be in 1988 ... butI am not going to quit ... that is His plan for me and for thisnation,'' Robertson said.   Other signposts on the Robertson campaign trail:   _He sued former Rep. Paul McCloskey for libel when McCloskeysaid Robertson used the influence of his father _ then a U.S.senator from Virginia _ to avoid combat in the Korean War. Aftersome messy preliminaries, Robertson dropped the suit because it wasto go to trial on Super Tuesday. He was ordered to pay court costs.   _He contended it was unfair and bigoted to describe him as aformer television evangelist, although that was how he becamefamous. He said cable businessman or religious broadcaster would bemore accurate.   _His claim, in a New Hampshire debate, that there were nuclearmissiles in Cuba aimed at this country. Robertson later said he hadno firsthand information, but insisted that ``nobody reallyknows.'' The contention was denied by the White House, the JointChiefs of Staff and others.   _His charges that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger``wanted to sterilize blacks, Jews, mental defectives, andfundamentalist Christians.'' Planned Parenthood officials dismissedthe allegation. Scholars who have studied Sanger's writings saidthere was no basis for the claim.   _Robertson's claim that the State Department chose to ignoreintelligence gathered by his Christian Broadcasting Network peoplein Beirut on the location of some American hostages. The former CBNbureau chief in Beirut later said he had no such information.   _And statements that one can get AIDS through casual contact,contradicting medical experts' findings on the subject. He alsoadvocated shooting down airplanes suspected of carrying drugs intothe country.   Robertson has said he will return to the television network hefounded nearly 30 years ago to help shore up its financialposition. Since Robertson left CBN to campaign, donations havefallen dramatically and several hundred workers have been laid off.   Robertson also promised to form a political action committee totrain and fund conservative Christian political candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
