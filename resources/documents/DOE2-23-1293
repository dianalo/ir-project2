During that time numerous changes have occurredin the government programs that sponsor RSIC and in the radiation transportcommunity which it serves. The continued need for RSIC is evident fromthe steady volume of requests and interactions with the user community.It is a continual challenge to adjust and adapt our operation to respondto the demands placed on RSIC by sponsors and users. Cooperation betweensponsors, users, and the RSIC staff is the key to keeping RSIC as thefocus of activities in the international radiation transport community.7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
