(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Arizona's attorney general said Thursdaythat the state cannot pay former Gov. Evan Mecham's $200,000 legalbill from his impeachment trial without a new law authorizing suchaction.   Legislators said Thursday they almost certainly will not passsuch a law.   A spokeswoman in Mecham's office said the former Republicangovernor would not comment on the non-binding opinion issued byAttorney General Bob Corbin, also a Republican, until Mecham andhis lawyers had a chance to review it.   Two days after Mecham's removal April 4 in a Senate impeachmenttrial, the Senate voted 16-13 to pay $202,433 to his attorneys,Fred Craft and Jerris Leonard. At the time, supporters said it wasa ``healing'' gesture.   But state Treasurer Ray Rottas balked at writing the check andasked Corbin for an opinion on whether the payment was permitted.   ``There is no authority to pay Evan Mecham's costs andattorneys' fees,'' Corbin concluded. However, he told reportersthat the state could pay Mecham's expenses if a new law were passedto authorize it.   ``We are not going to pass, in my estimation, anything in eitherhouse,'' said GOP Sen. John Mawhinney.   House Speaker Joe Lane, also a Republican, said HouseRepublicans were not enthusiastic about paying either the legalfees or Mecham's recall expenses.   The former governor has asked the state to pay him $231,000 forhis campaign costs before a May 17 recall vote aimed at his removalwas canceled.   Mecham was convicted by the Senate of trying to thwart a deaththreat investigation and misusing $80,000 by loaning it to his autodealership. He faces a criminal trial May 19 on charges ofconcealing a $350,000 campaign loan.</TEXT></DOC>
