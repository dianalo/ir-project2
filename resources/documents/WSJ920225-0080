It is not a comparison that shouldcomfort Mr. de Klerk. As the Gorbachev experience shows,political craftiness doesn't save a leader who lacks aplausible model for his country's future. Recent eventssuggest just how much such a model is needed now in SouthAfrica.   Politically, Mr. de Klerk's recent moves cannot befaulted. Last week, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party wona crucial by-election on Mr. de Klerk's home turf. Mr. deKlerk countered by calling a referendum among white votersabout the future of the multiracial negotiations. If theMarch 17 vote is yes, then the negotiations continue; if not,Mr. de Klerk said, then he will resign and the nation will goto hell.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. de Klerk's counterattack is a shrewd maneuver. Theprospect of discarding him, the only plausible white leader,should focus some minds. If the negotiation referendum doesfail, and the Conservatives come to power, then a blackuprising is more likely and world sanctions will bereimposed.   The Conservatives are blunt about this, telling theirfollowers that they will be poorer under Conservativegovernment, but, hunkered down in a neo-apartheid state, theywill be white-ruled. Mr. de Klerk is calling his detractors'bluff. Is this really the future they want for South Africa?   We can't imagine that this is an attractive vision, evenamong racists. If the referendum draws significantopposition, it will be because the negotiation endgames lookeven worse. Many perceive the negotiations as a mere pretextfor the transfer of power from the National Party to ANCrule. This would in all probability lead to tragedy. The ANChas not yet rid itself of the thrall of Marxist economicpolicies. Its military wing is menacing indeed. In times offlux, tightly disciplined Marxist cadres have provedsuccessful at seizing absolute power.   In addition, ANC domination, which would mean dominationby the Xhosa tribe, would further inflame ethnic rivalriesbetween blacks. The fighting with Inkatha would be madepermanent. If whites perceive the choice to be between anauthoritarian white racist state and an authoritarian blackMarxist state, then large numbers are going to resist change.   Mr. de Klerk has changed the face of South Africanpolitics by acknowledging that white authoritarian rule isnot only immoral, but unsustainable. He has gone on to lobbyhard for protection of minority rights. The ANC has not comeclose to meeting him halfway even on this.   But Mr. de Klerk has not taken the final step toacknowledge that no South African leader can ever again haveas much power as he and his government possess.   The whites brought up on apartheid inherit a system thatemphasized strong central government. The ANC leaders underthe influence of Karl Marx also instinctively believe instrong central government. In that sense they have much incommon. Even if they could reach an agreement on continuationof a strong central government, they will ill serve SouthAfrica's many ethnic groups and bring about constant strife.Genuine, constitutionally protected federalism is the onlyway out, but we hear little discussion of that.   If Mr. de Klerk's referendum fails, then the progress ofthe past years will be lost. But even if it passes, radicalrethinking is in order.</TEXT></DOC>
