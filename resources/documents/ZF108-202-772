(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jim BoyceandM;After trudging through command- and menu-driven CADD software, it's a realtreat to work with RoboCAD ($2,000) and RoboSolid ($2,000), two easy-to-use,icon-driven programs.andP;  As parts of Robo Systems Internional's modular packagefor design and analysis called RoboDesign, these products pack a lot of powerfor the engineer and drafter alike.andM;Both of the modules that are reviewed here include installation programs thatmake setting up directories, choosing devices, and configuring the system asimple 10-minute job.andP;  Happily, this simplicity carries over into systemoperation as well, thanks mainly to the excellent design of the userinterface.andM;RoboCAD and RoboSolid both offer pop-down menus and dialog-box status lines,but the real spark comes from their icon  menus.andP;  Nearly every commandselected from the pop-down menus generates a combination of icons and dialogboxes that can be moved to any point on the screen.andP;  A click of a mousebutton sends them back into limbo again when they are no longer needed.andP;  Theicons help a novice to become proficient in a short time without relyingheavily on the tutorial or manuals.andP;  And an experienced CADD user couldeasily become productive in both 3-D and 2-D in a single day.andM;A WINNER IN MANY RESPECTSandM;While RoboCAD doesn't have a few of the bells and whistles found in otherCADD program, all of the essentials are covered, and in some areas it reallyperforms.andP;  The dimensioning features are probably some of the easiest to useof any CADD package.andP;  With everything controlled by icons and dialog boxes,setting the style, terminator, text height, and other variables is a dreamcome true for anyone who has ever struggled with AutoCAD's hideous dimvars.andO;Any combination of dimension settings can be saved and retrieved as a wholewith a single command.andP;  Selecting an icon option lets you locate dimensiontext anywhere along the dimension line, or completely off it if you wish.andO;Setting tolerance and limit values is as easy as clicking an icon.andM;Text is an area where other packages could take a few pointers from RoboCAD.andO;As with dimensioning, all variables are controlled by icons and dialog boxes.andO;Text is entered via a full-screen editor that offers complete cursor controland the ability to edit single or multiple lines of text.andP;  When you arefinished entering your text it's attached to the cursor for dragging intoposition.andP;  After the first placement the text is retained on the cursor andcan be placed at other locations in different fonts, sizes, and slants, oreven isometrically by clicking the appropriate icon to change the setting.andO;Existing text can then be revised by using the editor.andM;A host of other easy-to-use but powerful features exist to let you do almostanything else you can think of in 2-D.andP;  These include an HPGL-to-RoboCADtranslator, which provides an efficient way to translate data betweendissimilar systems that are not usually on speaking terms.andM;Of course no program is perfect, and RoboCAD is not an exception.andP;  Withoutenough extra memory to contain the entire program, the system can be slowbecause it becomes heavily disk-intensive.andP;  Also, basic features, such asassociative dimensions, creation of polygons, and automatic trimming of linesafter fillet and chamfer, are missing.andP;  The package also lacks some of theinstant point snaps, like midpoint and quadrant, that make drawingconstruction a much simpler task.andP;  The next release-RoboCAD 20, due out bythe end of the first quarter in 1990-will not only address those areas butwill go well beyond, offering multiple DOS windows, keyboard commands, timedauto-save, networking support, an integrated drawing control system, and anintegrated, full-featured word processor.andM;A SOLID PACKAGEandM;For creating solid models, RoboSolid offers the same ease-of-use as RoboCAD.andO;One of the most important features is RoboSolid's ability to display a modelwith hidden surfaces dashed, and then export that view to RoboCAD for 2-Ddetailing.andP;  This saves a substantial amount of drafting time.andM;Since RoboSolid is intended as a solid rather than surface modeler, complexmodeling of double-curved and twisted surfaces is not included.andP;  However,many extremely complex forms can be created by extruding different views ofan object and letting RoboSolid calculate their intersection.andP;  Profiles canbe created in RoboSolid or imported from RoboCAD and then extruded, turned,tapered, or projected along a multidirectional, non-linear path.andP;  Booleanfunctions for uniting, subtracting, intersecting, and blending solids are assimple as selecting a single command.andM;RoboSolid provides four viewing styles: wireframe, hidden lines removed,hidden lines shown dashed, or shaded.andP;  The image can be changed fromperspective to isometric projection at any viewing angle in any of thosemodes.andP;  Light-source location, intensity, and depth-cuing are controlled bysliding bars.andP;  Solids can be mirrored or sectioned, with sections exportableto RoboCAD in 2-D.andP;  And when mass properties are needed, weight, volume,surface area, CG, moments of inertia, and products of inertia, take onlyseconds to calculate.andM;With additional memory or a virtual disk to cut down on disk access, theprogram models and repaints very quickly-you won't have time to make a tripto the water cooler or call a friend while waiting for it to finish anoperation.andP;  All of RoboSolid's features and ease-of-use combined to makecreating the test model and exporting it to 2-D a painless 15-minute process.andM;If you're looking for a modeler to paint beautiful, photo-realistic images onyour screen, look elsewhere.andP;  That's not what RoboSolid is all about.andP;  Afterall, the result you're after and the one RoboSolid provides is usually anaccurate 3-D representation-not gratuitously impressive-looking images thattake hours to produce and have absolutely no impact on your profit margin.andM;What else does the RoboDesign system offer? Availability in 20 languages,bills of material, time management and reporting, and wonderfully simple fontcustomization-it's all in the package.andP;  With integrated surface modeling andfinite-element analysis on the way, RoboDesign could even make adyed-in-the-wool AutoCAD fanatic sit up and take notice.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
