A potentially influential group of U.S. politiciansis arguing that Canada's desire to enhance its power exports is the realmotive behind its push for stronger acid rain legislation south of theborder. The recent introduction by a U.S. congressman of a bill to reduceCanada's estimated $1-billion of electricity exports, passed, could restrictCandian exports from utilities in Manitoba, Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswickand British Columbia. It would require the U.S. Government to determineif Canadian power generation and transmission plants comply with U.S.environmental laws. If the plants did not comply, their power could notbe sold to U.S. customers. Canada has been urging the United States toadopt tougher air pollution controls, specifically a 50% cut by 1994in sulphur dioxide emissions that cross into Canada. U.S. politiciansopposed to such legislation argue the expensive controls would make alreadycheaper Canadian power even more attractive for U.S. customers. If thepoliticians win support for their argument, proposed U.S. acid rain legislationcould be stalled and Canadian power exports could be drastically reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
