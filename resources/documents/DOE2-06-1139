<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-1139 </DOCNO><TEXT>A theoretical study on the structural phase transition (SPT) in La/sub2/CuO/sub 4/ ceramics caused by soft rotational zone-boundary modes isreported. In order to describe such SPT the vibrations of oxygen anionsin the rigid lattice of the other ions are investigated. The tetragonalphase is built up by successive and shifted CuO/sub 6/ octahedral layers.There are two in-equivalent positions of oxygen ions surrounding onecopper ion. A symmetry analysis shows that the SPT D/sub 4h//sup 17/-D/sub2h//sup 18/ leads to a two-component order parameter due to the rotationof the CuO/sub 6/ octahedron around the (-1, 1, 0) and the (1, 1, 0)axis. Hamiltonians are given to describe the motion of oxygen ions inthe tilting mode. The frequencies of the phonon mode and the height ofthe potential wall for the oxygen ion motion are calculated. The influenceof substituting La by Ba or Sr is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
