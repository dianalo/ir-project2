But there are signs the anti-tax fever that gripped the nationafter Californians enacted Proposition 13 in June 1978 has cooledas inflation has eased, the economy has improved and taxpayers nolonger feel so squeezed.   Only in South Dakota, Utah and Colorado will voters decideissues this November that would force deep cuts in taxes.   ``Voters are protecting what exists, but not going further. Andin some cases, it looks like the electorate is willing to approve,more so than in the '70s or early '80s, very specific taxes forspecific purposes,'' said Patrick McGuigan, editor of the FreeCongress Initiative and Referendum Report, a monthly newsletterpublished in Washington.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States has agreed to pay thePhilippines $481 million annually and back a bond program to helpease the country's foreign debt as part of a lease agreement forU.S. military bases, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said Sunday.   Secretary of State George Shultz and Manglapus planned to signthe pact on Monday. In Manila, Philippine President Corazon Aquinoannounced the expected signing, but provided no details.   A U.S.-Philippines working group picked away at the details ofthe agreement on Saturday and again on Sunday. While some technicalpoints remained to be resolved, the signing ceremony tentativelywas set for Monday afternoon.   ``We still continue to be hopeful to conclude thenegotiations,'' said Alex Almasov, a State Department press officer.</TEXT><DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sabotage or another criminal actcaused a plane crash that killed President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, theU.S. ambassador and 28 others, said a report released Sunday by aU.S.-Pakistan investigation team.   The 365-page report ruled out mechanical failure in the Aug. 17crash of the Hercules C-130 transport plane, said Pakistan airforce Cmdr. Abbas Mirza, who gave a 27-page summary to reporters ata hastily called news conference.   ``The board believes that the accident was most probably causedthrough the perpetration of a criminal act or sabotage,'' said thesummary by the 10-member U.S.-Pakistan team.   The summary did not blame any person or group for the crash butcalled for a separate criminal investigation.</TEXT><DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Planes brought food supplies to starvingrefugees Sunday, but a relief official said it would take at leasttwo weeks to reduce deaths and help emaciated people so weak theycan't protect the corpses of loved ones from scavenging hyenas.   Another relief official said the $1 million, 10-day airlift tothe war-ravaged south, which began Thursday, came too late to savethousands of younger children.   Twin-engine Cessnas are carrying 90 tons of food to about 40,000southerners facing starvation in Abyei, 500 miles southwest ofKhartoum. They are hoping to provide stopgap relief for those wholeft behind their crops and cattle to escape a civil war in theregion.   A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeksbefore the impact of the U.S.-financed supply mission could befelt. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eightto 10 people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatmentand a long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A year after Wall Street's crash, Americanswidely view the stock market as a risky investment, and fully athird see a good chance it will plummet again soon, a MediaGeneral-Associated Press poll has found.   Although respondents doubted the market's stability, 75 percentsaid the crash of Oct. 19, 1987, had little or no effect on theirlives, and only about one in 10 said their finances had worsened inthe past year.   But the crash did have one apparent impact: Of the 1,125 adultsin the national telephone survey, more than six in 10 said theywere being more cautious with their money now than they were a yearago.   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points in panicselling on Black Monday, after dropping 108 points the previousFriday. Stock losses amounted to $500 billion, but the crash didnot set off an economic recession, as had been feared.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 100th Congress, running behind schedule,is trying to finish work this week on election-year bills dealingwith drugs and taxes so members can return home to campaign.   Some legislators were so itchy to leave town that on Friday theysported buttons reading, ``Free the 100th.''   ``I certainly would hope we wouldn't have to stay beyondWednesday. But nobody can predict that,'' said Senate MajorityLeader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.   Congress originally aimed to quit Sept. 30, but bogged down in afight over the anti-drug package. The Senate finally passed its$2.6 billion version on Friday.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress, disturbed by evidence the EnergyDepartment has mismanaged nuclear weapons reactors, has passed alaw to put them under standards nearly as stringent as thoseapplied to reactors used to produce electricity.   Some lawmakers, however, believe even tougher legislation isneeded in the wake of the Energy Department's acknowledgement thatits aging reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.,have experienced problems and that other plants have spewedradioactivity into the environment.   ``The main difficulty is that the Department of Energy has beenits own policeman,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., one of theauthors of a bill passed in September creating the Defense NuclearFacilities Board to monitor the operation of weapons reactors.   The board, yet to be appointed by the president, has theauthority to inspect the facilities at which the Energy Departmentmanufactures nuclear weapons for the Pentagon.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State Department officials engaged in quietdiscussions last week about a man who, although unseen by theoutside world for nine years, is at the heart of a diplomaticdebate over one of the world's most unfortunate countries.   He is Pol Pot, whose three-and-a-half-year rule in Cambodiaduring the late 1970's led to the slaughter of perhaps 2 million ofhis countrymen before he and his Khmer Rouge allies were driven outby Vietnamese invaders.   David Hawk, an authority on the Khmer Rouge, says Pol Pot isbelieved to be operating out of a small town in Thailand near theCambodian border, plotting a return to power once the Vietnamesecarry out their stated intention to withdraw from Cambodia in 1990.   Hawk has written on Cambodia for Freedom House, a New York-basedhuman rights group, and formerly worked for Amnesty International.</TEXT><DATELINE>GOULD, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A racial slur uttered in frustration nearlyended Lois Bostic's 27-year career in education. Then her blackstudents stepped in, taught their elders a lesson in tolerance, andsaved Mrs. Bostic's job.   ``We were ready to forgive and go on,'' said senior AngelaMatthews, 17, one of six students who initiated, typed anddistributed petitions in support of the white librarian. ``Anybodyought to get a second chance.''   After the slur was reported last month, parents in this farmingtown 80 miles southeast of Little Rock circulated petitions callingfor Mrs. Bostic's ouster, and she told school officials she wouldquit. The board promptly endorsed her decision.   But then, high school students mounted their own petition drive,the school board rescinded its resolution, and Mrs. Bostic is hereto stay.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here he's called ``Mikki Maus,'' and the60-year-old American has surprisingly good rapport with Sovietyoungsters for an international film star making his first liveappearance in the Soviet Union.   Sunday evening at Moscow's 2,500-seat Rossiya Theater, with apolice cordon worthy of a minor head of state outside, the firstSoviet festival of Walt Disney animated classics opened with ashowing of ``Fantasia'' and a visit by Mickey Mouse himself.   Standing about 5 foot, 6 inches in his clunky black patentleather shoes, Mickey, played by Gabriella Spieth from WaltDisney's West German office, strolled waving down the theater aisleto the strains of ``Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off to Work We Go.''   In a juvenile version of the Moscow superpower summit, Mickeywas given a big hug and a keg of honey by Misha the Bear, mascot ofthe 1980 Moscow Olympics.</TEXT></DOC>
