(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The indictment of defense consultantThomas E. Muldoon will likely send prosecutors investigatingPentagon procurement fraud to trial for the second time in the3-year-old probe.   All but two of the 23 individuals convicted in the ``Ill Wind''case have pleaded guilty, but Muldoon's lawyer said Tuesday thatMuldoon has already turned down a government offer to plead guiltyand denies charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe aMarine Corps procurement official.   ``Muldoon denies it all, denies there was any criminal intent onhis part at any time,'' Albert J. Ahern Jr. said. ``His positionfrom the very beginning is that he denied any bribery, therefore heisn't going to plea to that.''   Court documents portray Muldoon as a major figure in the defenseprocurement scandal, operating in a network of people who gotsecret information on contracts from Pentagon sources and sold itto companies seeking the military contracts.   He was charged Tuesday after two former executives of WhittakerCommand and Control Systems, and the corporate unit itself, pleadedguilty to participating in the bribery scheme with Muldoon.   Scott M. Lamberth, the subsidiary's former president, and JohnF. Van Tassel, once director of its Fayetteville, Ark., operations,said they funneled more than $80,000 in bribes to Marine Corpsprocurement official Jack Sherman through Muldoon and two otherdefense consultants, John Marlowe and Donald Illeman.   Marlowe is the government's original informant who ledinvestigators to Sherman, who pleaded guilty to taking other bribesand received an 18-month sentence.   According to court papers filed Tuesday, the bribery schemebegan with a private company called Lee Telecommunications, whichWhittaker Corp. purchased in 1986 and made a subsidiary.   In 1981, Lee Telecommunications arranged, through Muldoon, tobribe Sherman to help obtain a contract to provide an electronicscomponent for a battlefield air traffic control system beingdeveloped by the Marines, according to the court papers.   Over seven years, Lee paid $200,000 to Marlowe, Muldoon andIlleman, who shared their fees with Sherman, prosecutors say.   The Marine Corps official then authorized modifications in thecompany's contracts that brought their total value to $7.7 million.   Indicted with Muldoon on Tuesday was Leonard L. Ingram, formervice president of Lee Telecommunications, and later of theWhittaker Command subsidiary.   Ingram's attorney, Marcus Topel, said Ingram also wanted tostand trial.   ``I think this is a classic case of guilt by association,'' theSan Francisco lawyer said. ``I think the trial will show he hadabsolutely nothing to do with any of these wrongful activities, andat most was present at various times when they were discussed anddid nothing further than that.''   In the only other jury trial resulting from the investigation,two Teledyne Electronics executives were convicted last spring ofconspiracy and wire fraud but were cleared of charges theyparticipated in a separate bribery scheme.   The guilty plea by the Whittaker subsidiary is the third by acorporation in the case.   Teledyne Industries and Hazeltine Corp. pleaded guilty inconnection with their roles in the procurement scandal.   The Whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines andpenalties. According to court papers, Lamberth deliberatelywithheld information about the bribery scheme from Whittaker Corp.officials in Los Angeles.   Company attorney Daniel H. Bookin told U.S. District JudgeClaude Hilton Whittaker officials in Los Angeles were unaware ofthe scheme. ``No one who is involved in those activities iscurrently with the company,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
