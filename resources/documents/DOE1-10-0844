Diode laser array pumpedNd:YAG and Nd:glass lasers have been demonstrated. Theoretical studiesof non-planar oscillators have been advanced, producing new designs whichshould be more resistant to feedback and offer better frequency stability.A monolithic, singly resonant Optical Parametric Oscillator in MgO:LiNbO{sub3} has been operated.</TEXT></DOC>
