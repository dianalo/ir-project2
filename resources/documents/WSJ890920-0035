The alliance between the two technology giants is in a rapidly evolving area of semiconductor design. Fiber distributed chips allow computers to communicate with each other over optical fibers, which can transmit more information at higher speeds than conventional wiring. The chips are used to help link networks of high-power, high-speed computers.    The companies said they initially plan to produce a group of four chips. The chips will be manufactured at Motorola facilities and Digital will purchase a portion of them for its own computers and other products that use optical fibers. </TEXT></DOC>
