One friend has gone to Australia, another to Paris. One colleague has hanged himself, another has been arrested. The only person in their homeland who's reachable by telephone is the man they suspect of being an informer.    As written by Janusz Glowacki, directed by Arthur Penn and acted by Dianne Wiest and Ron Silver, the scene plays almost like a George Burns-Gracie Allen routine. The idea of the phone call is lofted like a ping-pong ball; it's then swatted back and forth, getting more and more battered every time. Finally, it's too bruised even to roll, never mind fly. The comic form is classic, the execution flawless, yet the scene's comedy does nothing to displace its wrenching emotions -- the dull ache and betrayed hopes of dissident exiles everywhere.    If Mr. Glowacki's couple, a writer and an actress, look back on Poland with a sad mixture of longing and loathing, they are equally ambivalent about their new home on New York's Lower East Side. Clearly based on Mr. Glowacki's own bemused, bewildered, and ultimately aggrieved reaction to his adventures here, &quot;Hunting Cockroaches&quot; offers theatergoers the bracing experience of seeing the world from a completely lucid yet totally skewed point of view.    Running through Sunday at the Manhattan Theatre Club, &quot;Cockroaches&quot; is set in the seedy bedroom of the seedy apartment furnished by Enka and Yannick with castoffs scavenged from the city's better neighborhoods. The two are bedeviled by noisy neighbors -- Yannick says the old hag downstairs must have inspired Dostoevski's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; -- and a never-ending parade of disgusting creatures. He explains the rat under the bed by saying, &quot;Diss iss just a beeg mouse.&quot; They find sleep impossible.    But the real reason they can't rest, of course, is in their minds. And Mr. Glowacki cleverly dramatizes their plight by having the real-life nightmares that plague them jump up from beneath the bed: an American immigration officer whose routine but absurd questions set off waves of self-doubt (&quot;Is cramps a venereal disease?&quot;); a pair of Polish secret policemen whose matter-of-fact thuggery is laced with sage advice (&quot;A smart man never writes; a smart man never leaves traces.&quot;); a couple of well-meaning but dense philanthropist types who offer blankets and condescension (&quot;They're such interesting people!&quot;).    Perhaps the most telling encounter comes near the end of the second act, when Yannick's Polish censor appears and offers a deal. &quot;You'll never write anything in the States,&quot; he warns. And, he adds, &quot;We believe a short stay on the Lower East Side is a priceless experience for our free thinkers.&quot; Yannick, who has indeed been unable to write since his arrival, and whose stay on the Lower East Side has indeed been less than delightful, is not tempted. &quot;I got a memory,&quot; he says.    Caught between their memories of an impossible past and their fears of an impossible future, Mr. Glowacki's emigres would engage us even if he hadn't bothered to make them so charmingly eccentric. As it happens, Enka is a slave to her histrionic abilities and Yannick an inveterate con artist. She walks around in her nightgown reciting Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking speech; he learns that the handicapped can't be evicted for nonpayment of rent and scrounges up a wheelchair.    Relishing every rolled &quot;r&quot; and reveling in each mispronounced syllable, Ms. Wiest and Mr. Silver give delicious performances. Mr. Glowacki's characters, rendered into colloquially uncolloquial English by his translator, Jadwiga Kosicka, don't know they're funny. And it takes a very subtle brand of comic acting to convey both their humor and their lack of it. Ms. Wiest and Mr. Silver both rise admirably to the challenge. The supporting cast has some lapses, but, luckily, Ms. Wiest and Mr. Silver don't need too much support here.    There are also some lapses in the writing. The first act could probably be trimmed a bit with no great loss. And on the night I saw the production, the all-important light fixture that goes on and off as the characters try and then stop trying to go to sleep was not quite in synch with the actors.    But this is one of the delights of a fairly dismal theatrical year. And Mr. Glowacki, who found himself stranded in the West when martial law was declared in Poland, has clearly beaten the cockroaches -- and maybe some of his demons as well. </TEXT></DOC>
