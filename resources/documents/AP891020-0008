John Glenn lost his chance to beMichael Dukakis' presidential running mate last year because hegave unconvincing answers about his connection to a campaigncontributor in the savings and loan industry, says a new book.   The book, ``All By Myself: The Unmaking of a PresidentialCampaign,'' says Dukakis was leaning toward the Ohio Democrat ashis vice presidential candidate until aides warned theMassachusetts governor that Glenn's finances could be a politicalliability.   Thomas Oliphant, a Boston Globe reporter who wrote the book withcolleague Christine M. Black, said this week that the contributor,who wasn't named in the book, was Charles H. Keating Jr., presidentof Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Irvine, Calif.   ``No one suggested that Senator Glenn had done anything illegalor even ethically questionable, but the hard time he had answeringquestions forcefully was potentially troublesome,'' The DaytonDaily News quoted the book as saying in a story in Saturday'seditions.   The newspaper said it obtained a copy of the book, which has notbeen released.   Federal investigators last month accused Keating of stealingmore than $1.1 billion from his savings and loan through illegalloans and phony real-estate and tax transactions.   Glenn and four other senators have come under criticism forintervening with federal regulators two years ago during aninvestigation of Keating. Keating has made donations to Glenntotaling $234,000.   Oliphant said, ``It had to do with a judgment as to which personwould stand up better in front of a battery of 500 microphones ifit ever came to that.''   Glenn refused through an aide to comment on the book and a bookon the savings and loan scandal, ``The Big Fix,'' that recountsGlenn's involvement on Keating's behalf.   ``The senator hasn't read these books,'' Glenn press secretaryRebecca Bell said. ``We just are not going to comment on excerptsfrom a book.''   Dukakis chose Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running mateafter campaign aides argued Glenn was a less reliable candidatebecause of questions about his finances, the book says.   At the time, news organizations were reporting Glenn as thefront-runner for the No. 2 spot, citing sources in the Dukakiscampaign.   Glenn has acknowledged a long relationship with Keating, butdenied any wrongdoing. The senator said he met twice with federalregulators in April 1987 at Keating's request after Keatingcomplained the investigation of his business was taking too long,but backed off after learning the probe could lead to criminalcharges.   Chairman Paul Brountas, the Dukakis campaign chairman whoconducted the final interviews with both Glenn and Bentsen,disputed the book's assertion that Glenn's demeanor underquestioning threw the nomination to Bentsen.   ``I disagree with the author and if he got it from a top aide, Idisagree with the top aide,'' Brountas said.   But Brountas acknowledged the Dukakis campaign throughlyreviewed what he called ``the strengths and weaknesses of thecandidates, what they would add to the campaign, what kind of vicepresidents they would be.''</TEXT></DOC>
