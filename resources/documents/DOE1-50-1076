Important astrophysical objects like accretiondiscs, protostellar and protoplanetary nebulae, and galaxies are thoughtto regenerate a magnetic field through a dynamo mechanism. Although thereis a well-developed theory for describing the regeneration of magneticfields in these objects, there are not any specific methods to calculatesuch magnetic fields in the general case. In this work, after a descriptionof the dynamo theory, the specific method for solving the nonsphericaldynamo is introduced. The unique feature of this method is accommodationof variable magnetic diffusivity in order to model the shape of a disc-likebody. The detailed construction of the method is presented, as well asdescription of mathematical and numerical methods used for obtainingthe solution. The method of checking the model with respect to sell-establishedspherical models is also presented. Finally, some examples are calculatedand discussion is given on the behavior of calculated magnetic fieldsand possible astrophysical implications.</TEXT></DOC>
