Atwood, now heads the DAB.andM;The acquisition undersecretary will be in charge o expediting implementationof DAB decisions and will report to Cheney and Atwood on cost, schedule andperformance decisions for major acquisitions.andM;Cheney said other acquisition goals include improving the training andeducation of the acquisition work force and cutting back bureaucraticinefficiencies that hamper programs.andM;Bush in February directed Cheney to develop a plan to improve the defenseprocurement process by implementing recommendations in the Packard Commissionreport and the Goldwater-Nichols Act.andP;  The Packard Commission had recommendedthat the acquisition undersecretary supervise the performance of the entireacquisition system and set policy for research and development, testing,logistics and procurement.andP;  The commission also made many recommendations inthe areas of personnel and organization, defense planning and accountability.andM;The MAISRC was established in 1978 after DOD experienced cost overruns andschedule delays in its ADP programs.andP;  In 1983, Defense officials strengthenedthe council's role by reducing the number of high-level review required formajor ADP buys and updating life cycle management practices to emphasize theneed for more rigorous planning and increased competition.andM;The council's membership was expanded in 1984 to include a representativefrom each of the military services.andP;  In 1986, the DOD consolidatedresponsibility for all major general-purpose ADP systems under thecomptroller.andP;  The directors of program analysis and operational test andevaluation joined the MAISRC that year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
