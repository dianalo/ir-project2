This fact suggests that the optical activity associatedwith the backbone chromophore may arise from an excess of one of thehelical senses now cast into diastereomeric states as a consequence ofthe chiral stereogenicity of the pendant groups. This interpretationis supported by the large negative increase in D-line optical rotationon formation of the polyisocyanates and the same-signed exciton-likecouplet clearly associated with the higher energy absorption maximumin both polymers. Experiments are in progress to reveal the per deuteriumenergy difference favoring one helical sense. Such information will behelpful to understanding the structural forces behind the conformationalequilibrium isotope effect reported in this work. Diasterotopic carbonhydrogen stretching frequency differences could play a role, and theircontributions could be evaluated by spectroscopic experiments also inprogress.</TEXT></DOC>
