But it erupted into a controversy onWall Street that touched sensitive nerves and threatened to changeforever the bond market.   The auction of the $100 million bond issue by Carolina Power andamp;Light Co. almost broke the monopoly that investment houses enjoyover the rights to bid on public debt issues.   But at the last minute, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., therenegade bidder, pulled out of the auction, apparently underpressure from the four Wall Street bidders in the race.   The only party willing to comment after the dust settled onWednesday's auction was Met Life, which said it had no qualms aboutits action and would do it again.   What Met Life did was to put in a bid for the bonds, which weredestined to be sold on the open market. The issuers of such bondstraditionally hold an auction to sell the bonds to a Wall Streetfirm, which in turn sells the bonds to the public at a markup.   But Met Life wanted the bonds for its own investment purposes _by law, insurance companies are barred from selling bonds or othersecurities to the public.   Insurance companies traditionally buy new bond issues throughso-called private placements, or issues that aren't designed forthe public market. With private placements, the insurance companyagrees to buy an entire block of bonds from the utility company orother issuer. In turn, the buyer often has a say in how the bondsare structured.   Apparently Met Life persuaded Carolina Power to includeanti-takeover provisions, called protective covenants, in thebonds, which made them attractive to the life insurance giant.   Takeovers are a major concern of Met Life and other insurers,who have seen the value of some of their bonds plummet after thecompany that issued them was bought in a leveraged buyout.   In particular, Met Life was burned when its RJR Nabisco Inc.bonds turned into junk bonds after the leveraged buyout of the foodand tobacco giant earlier this year by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. Met Life has filed a lawsuit against RJR and KKR over thematter.   Protective covenants to guard against a loss in bond value dueto takeovers, or ``event risks,'' traditionally are included inprivately placed bonds, said Paul Reardon, director of investmentresearch for the American Council of Life Insurance.   ``There weren't many event risk losses on private placementsbecause there were protective covenants written in,'' Reardon said.   But the four Wall Street firms bidding on the Carolina Powerbonds _ Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. _ apparently would not havereceived the same safeguards. An hour before the auction, Met Lifesaid it was told that its bid would not be accepted by CarolinaPower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Wall Sreet firmsapplied pressure on the utility to reject the bid.   After the Met Life bid was rejected, Morgan Stanley won theright to sell the bonds, Carolina Power said.   Met Life said it wasn't deterred by the experience and wouldmake bids on public bond issues in the future.   That statement is significant because insurance companies ownabout half of all outstanding debt issues. Should other insurersfollow Met Life's path, it could signal a fundamental change in theway bond issues are written and sold in this country.   Such a change would further erode the territory of the WallStreet giants, whose securities business already is threatened bymoves to allow banks and other institutions to sell securities. Andit could further cut into their profits, which have been slumpingdue to the decline in interest in stocks following the market crashof October 1987.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, April 24</NOTE></DOC>
