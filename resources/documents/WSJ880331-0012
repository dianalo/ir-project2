A public hearing is scheduled for April 18, with a final decision due in early May, on whether the EPA will allow the company to grow two fields of corn in Maryland with the internal pesticide this summer.    Crop Genetics, Hanover, Md., would inject corn with a plant-dwelling microbe called Cxc that has been altered with a gene from a bacteria called Bt, which produces a protein lethal to cornkilling pests. The EPA said it favored allowing the proposed test, with some modifications, because &quot;this microorganism has limited persistence in the environment and is not likely to be harmful to non-target organisms.&quot;    The Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Inspection Service also is studying the plan, which has split environmental groups. </TEXT></DOC>
