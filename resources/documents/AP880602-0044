About half of the 345 adults contacted in the telephone surveythis spring believed the death penalty would be appropriate forcertain situations.   The percentages ranged from 47 percent support for the deathpenalty for a drug dealer who sells crack to a user to 59 percentfor capital punishment for a person who kills seven people afterbeing fired from a job.   Sixty-four percent said they approve of the death penalty, andonly 29 percent disapproved, compared with 43 percent approval and51 percent disapproval in 1985.   Rhode Island has no death penalty.
