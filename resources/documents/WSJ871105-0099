In what promises to be a spirited public relations battle over future electric rates, Mayor Harold Washington unveiled a study indicating that Chicago customers could save as much as $18 billion over the next 20 years by having the city dump the utility and generate its own electricity.    The city's franchise agreement with Commonwealth Edison expires at the end of 1990 and officials here are unhappy with electric rates, which have jumped on six occasions in the past 10 years. A proposed 27% increase would make the city's rates third highest in the nation, behind those of New York and San Diego. At a news conference, the mayor called the cost of electricity &quot;a tidal wave threatening to wash this city's economic base out to sea.&quot;    The company promptly called its own news conference and denounced the city's study as &quot;seriously flawed&quot; and based on &quot;highly improbable assumptions.&quot; A spokesman said the utility would consider going to court to protect the future of its municipal franchise.    The company's shares closed yesterday at $29.375, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Underlying the rhetoric is serious concern on both sides over Commonwealth Edison's rates, which have been rising steeply while most of the nation's utilities have been cutting back on electric charges. City officials fear the rising rates will drive away new business, while Commonwealth Edison is searching for some way to pay $7 billion it owes for three recently finished nuclear power plants. State regulators earlier this year rejected as too expensive an unorthodox utility plan to pay for the nuclear plants, forcing Commonwealth Edison to submit a traditional request for a 27% increase. Few people familiar with the situation give the utility much hope of getting anywhere near that much.    Chicago's study, which was done for the city by the consulting firm of R.W. Beck andamp; Associates, said electric customers within the city would save as much as $12.5 billion if Chicago purchased bulk power for the next 20 years from utilities other than Commonwealth Edison. If the city buys outside power just for its own facilities it would save about $1.3 billion during the next two decades, the study said.    Commonwealth Edison has about two million customers inside Chicago and services a total of three million customers in the city's entire metropolitan area.    Chicago planning officials said some 2,200 communities currently have their own municipal utilities. The communities, ranging in size from hamlets to the city of Los Angeles, charge an average of 30% less for power than do investor-owned utilities such as Commonwealth Edison, the officials said.    Mayor Washington called a municipal power agency &quot;one of the most challenging options&quot; for Chicago, but said the city hasn't reached any decision on whether to go ahead with the idea.    One major stumbling block to such a project could come from a bill introduced recently in Congress by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). The bill would curb the use of tax-exempt bonds by states and cities to buy existing facilities of investor-owned utilities. That would cripple any effort by Chicago to purchase Commonwealth Edison's facilities.    Mayor Washington said yesterday that he discussed the measure recently with Rep. Rostenkowski and that the congressman had assured him he was reconsidering his support of the bill. A Rostenkowski aide said the congressman met with the mayor last month and agreed to listen to the city's position before deciding on whether to continue pressing for the bill.    Commonwealth Edison said the Beck study badly underestimates the amount of electricity that customers in Chicago will use in the future. The study predicts energy conservation and co-generation of power within Chicago will reduce future demand for power, cutting down on what the city would have to spend beyond about $6.5 billion to buy existing Commonwealth Edison facilities.    Howard Axelrod, vice president of Planmetrics Inc., a Chicago-based consulting firm hired by Commonwealth Edison to analyze the Beck study, said the energy conservation measures that the study predicts would cost Chicago electric customers $700 each and that industrial customers in the city would have to spend an average of $1 million each to meet co-generation levels predicted in the study. Mr. Axelrod said that if Chicago bought its power from other utilities, customers could end up spending $300 million for new transmission lines.    &quot;My advice to the city of Chicago,&quot; Mr. Axelrod said, &quot;would be to put the Beck study on the shelf and cut your losses.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
