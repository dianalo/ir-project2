Authority</ITAG>Section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (``SDWA'' or ``the Act'') establishesrequirements a State must meet to obtain primary enforcement responsibility(``primacy'') for the public water system supervision (PWSS) program. Theseinclude: (1) Adopting drinking water regulations no less stringent thanthe national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) in effect undersections 1412(a) and 1412(b); (2) adopting and implementing adequate proceduresfor enforcement; (3) keeping records and making such reports with respectto its activities as EPA may require by regulation; (4) issuing variancesand exemptions (if allowed at all by the State) under conditions no lessstringent than allowed by sections 1415 and 1416; and (5) adopting andbeing able to implement an adequate plan for the provision of safe drinkingwater under emergency situations.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>40 CFR Part 142, Subpart B sets out requirements for States to obtain primacyfor the PWSS program, as authorized by section 1413 of the SDWA. EPA firstpromulgated these regulations on January 20, 1976; since then, the basicrequirements have remained relatively unchanged. Since 1976, however, muchhas happened in the PWSS program. With the exception of Wyoming, Indiana,and the District of Columbia, all eligible States and territories havereceived PWSS primacy. In addition, the SDWA amendments of 1986 made sweepingchanges in the scope and content of the drinking water program. For example,the amendments mandate that EPA promulgate NPDWRs for 83 drinking watercontaminants by 1989 and for 25 additional contaminants every three yearsthereafter. In addition, EPA must promulgate NPDWRs to specify criteriaunder which filtration is required as a treatment technique for publicwater systems supplied by surface water sources and which require disinfectionas a treatment technique for all public water systems. EPA also was requiredto revise its existing public notification procedures, which was completedon October 28, 1987. (See 52 FR 41534.) The 1986 SDWA amendments also increasethe Agency's authority to enforce the requirements of the national primarydrinking water regulations.With these extensive changes in the program and the law, portions of theprimacy regulations at 40 CFR Part 142, Subpart B have become outdated.The major deficiency in the existing primacy regulations is that they neitherrequire States with primacy to modify their programs to adopt new or revisedEPA national primary drinking water regulations, nor do they provide aprocedure for obtaining EPA approval for these changes.The rule EPA is proposing in this notice would specify which new requirementsmust be adopted by a State to maintain primacy, when these new requirementsmust be adopted, and the procedures for State submittal and EPA reviewand approval of State program revisions. In developing this proposal, EPAconsidered the impact of the federal program changes on current State programsand evaluated which new provisions might require State statutory or othermajor institutional changes within the State.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Under this proposal, the revised primacy regulations would notbe applicable to State program revisions to adopt new and revised EPA regulationspromulgated before the effective date of this rule. State requests forprogram revisions to adopt EPA regulations promulgated before the effectivedate of this rule (e.g., the public notification requirements) are to complywith the current regulations under Part 142, Subpart B, and any specialprimacy requirements in the program regulation to be adopted. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion of Today's Proposed Rule </ITAG>A. New Program Requirements Under 1986 SDWA Amendments As noted above, the SDWA amendments of 1986 greatly increased the scopeand content of the PWSS programs. The current program is operated principallyby the States; 54 States and Territories operate approved primacy programsunder the authority of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Ofthe States and Territories eligible for primacy, only Indiana and Wyomingdo not have primacy. The programs in these two States, in Washington, DC,and on Indian lands are directly implemented by EPA. In this notice, EPA is proposing that, to retain primacy, each State witha currently approved primacy program must revise that program to incorporatenew EPA regulations promulgated under section 1412 (a) and (b), sections1415 and 1416, and the revised public notification requirements under section1414. Under the SDWA, EPA has had a policy of approving only State programsthat have adopted the full EPA program. This policy was established fromthe start to avoid split accountability between EPA and the States fordirect operations and to ensure that, to the extent possible, public watersystems were regulated under a single regulatory scheme. This policy avoidsconfusion among the regulated community and the public regarding whichregulations must be followed to comply with the SDWA requirements. Forthe same reasons, EPA intends to continue this ``full primacy'' policyas it implements the 1986 SDWA amendments. The proposal maintains the ``full primacy'' policy by setting a deadlinefor States to revise their approved primacy programs to adopt new and revisedEPA regulation. This is discussed in Part IV.C. below. Although the proposalallows extensions to these deadlines for a limited period, some Statesmay be unable to adopt the new requirements by the end of the extensionperiod and, thus, would be in violation of the primacy requirements. Insome rare situations, a primacy State may never agree to or be able toadopt all the new and revised requirements promulgated by EPA. EPA solicitscomments on the impact the ``full primacy'' policy will have on currentState primacy programs, what responsibility EPA should assume to implementand enforce new federal requirements where the State has not adopted them,and the practical implication of a program that is partially implementedby both EPA and the State. Table 1 below summarizes the recent and upcoming EPA regulations currentlyidentified that the States would be required to adopt to retain primacy.The list of regulations in Table 1 is not meant to be complete and is subjectto change as EPA proceeds to implement the 1986 SDWA amendments. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0,,),i1,s25</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Summary of New EPA Requirements Under the SDWA Amendments Enacted June19, 1986 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">Regulatory Packages</ITAG><H1> </H1> New NPDWRs: <ITAG tagnum="12">VOCs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Coliforms </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Lead/Copper </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Inorganics/Synthetic Organics </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Radionuclides </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Other Mandated NPDWRs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">1st Additional 25 NPDWRs </ITAG>Public Notification Filtration andamp; Disinfection of Surface Water (NPDWR) Disinfection for Groundwater/Disinfectant By-products (NPDWR)</ITAG> For NPDWRs promulgated under sections 1412(a) and (b) and for the varianceand exemption provisions (under sections 1415 and 1416), States must adoptnew provisions that are ``no less stringent'' than the EPA regulations.EPA is also requiring that States adopt public notification requirementsthat are no less stringent than the revised Federal regulations (see 52FR 41534, October 28, 1987). B. Basic Requirements for State Program Revisions (Section 142.12(a)) EPA is proposing a new section (andSection; 142.12) to establish the requirements,application procedures, and the EPA review and decision process for Stateprogram revisions. EPA is proposing to define ``State program revision''as a statutory, regulatory, or administrative change to the ``approvedState primacy program.'' The proposed rule defines the ``approved Stateprimacy program'' as the program elements submitted with the initial Stateapplication for primacy pursuant to andSection; 142.11(a) and subsequentlyapproved by EPA and any EPA-approved revisions to these elements. The elementsrequired under andSection; 142.11(a) include: The text of the State's drinkingwater statute and regulations; a description of the State's proceduresfor the enforcement of the State regulations (including six sub-elements);a statement that the State will make such reports as required; the statutoryand regulatory provisions related to variances and exemptions (if the Stategrants them); a description of the State's plan for providing safe drinkingwater under emergency conditions; and an Attorney General's statement demonstratingadequate State authority, The Attorney General's Statement is a new requirementproposed in this notice and is discussed in further detail below. Theseelements, which would be updated with each State program revision and wouldbe maintained by both EPA and the State, would describe the current approvedState primacy program at any point in time. Not all portions of the Statedrinking water program are necessarily part of the approved State primacyprogram; e.g., many States have an operator certification program, a permitprogram for water treatment plants, or regulations governing other contaminantsbeyond the EPA NPDWRs. These would not be considered part of the approvedprogram because they go beyond the primacy requirements established byEPA pursuant to the SDWA. Section 142.12(a) of the proposed rule would require a State to notifyEPA in writing of any modifications to its statutory or regulatory authorityor program procedures that may affect the approved primacy program. Thisnotification requirement is to ensure that EPA is kept informed of actionsthat may affect the authority or capability of the State to fully implementthe approved primacy program. The material submitted with the notificationmust be sufficient to allow EPA to determine whether the change constitutesa revision to the approved primacy program, thus requiring EPA review andapproval. Based on the State's notification, EPA would determine, on a case-by-casebasis, whether the changes constitute revisions to the State primacy programand thus must be submitted for approval. Under this proposal, State actionsto adopt any new or revised EPA regulation (except for very minor changes,which are discussed below) would be considered a revision to the approvedprimacy program and the State would be required to submit it to EPA forapproval. Therefore, for revisions to adopt new or revised EPA regulations,the State could bypass the notification step and simply submit a requestfor approval of the revision directly. For minor program revisions theinformation submitted with the notification may be sufficient to reviewand approve the revision; in such cases, the Agency does not intend toask the State to submit a separate, formal request for approval. Likewise,in the rare circumstances in which a new or revised EPA regulation doesnot require any changes to the approved primacy program, the State wouldsimply notify EPA of this fact; in such a case, the Agency does not intendto require the State to submit a formal rquest for approval. The proposal would also allow the Administrator to require State submissionof materials whenever he or she has reason to believe that the State programmay have changed, in the event the State fails to notify the Agency ofsuch a change. If the Administrator determines that the State changes affectthe approved primacy programs, the Administrator would ask the State tosubmit a request for EPA approval of the State program revision. EPA invites comment on whether it is appropriate for the Administrator(or his or her designee) to require States to notify EPA of all changesto their authorities and procedures that may affect the approved primacyprogram and to approve or disapprove each State program change that revisedthe approved primacy program. Comments are also requested on what categoriesof State changes do not require notification and what program revisionsare minor and do not require the State to submit a separate, formal requestfor EPA approval.C. Timing of State Program Revisions (Section 142.12(b))Proposed andSection; 142.12(b) would require the State to submit to EPA finalrequests for approval of program revisions to adopt new or revised EPAregulations within 15 months of the promulgation of EPA's regulations.The Administrator would be required to act on such requests within 90 daysafter receipt of the final and complete State request. EPA would not beginits final review until it has determined that the State submission is completeand final. The proposal would allow the Administrator to initiate an extensionof these deadlines or approve a State request for an extension of the 15-monthdeadline under certain circumstances.EPA is proposing the 1-month period for review of State requests for approvalof program revisions to coincide with the effective date of most of thenew EPA regulations. (Section 1412(b)(10) of the SDWA provides that NPDWRsbecome effective 18 months after promulgation by EPA.) The Agency did consideroptions for ``clustering'' the deadlines to minimize the disruption inState programs that may occur with the large number of sequential changesexpected over the next several years. EPA recognizes the advantages of``clustering'' program revisions and has proposed that ``clustering'' bean explicit factor in deciding whether to grant State requests for an extensionof the 18-month period. (See discussion below.)By using the effective date of the NPDWR as the deadline for the adoptionand review process, EPA would minimize situations of split program responsibilityor ``partial primacy'' because a State that adopts the change and has itapproved on time would implement and enforce the new requirement from thetime it is effective. This would avoid the need for EPA to implement andenforce the new requirement in a situation where all other requirementsare administered by the State. Splitting oversight responsibilities betweenEPA and the primacy State, however briefly, may confuse administrationof the program and make it difficult for public water system owners andoperators and the public to determine which State and Federal regulationsare being enforced by whom at any given time.Nevertheless, EPA recognizes that for valid reasons a State request forapproval and EPA's review of State program revisions may take more than18 months. EPA wishes to avoid initiating primacy withdrawal in cases wherea State is making a good-faith effort to adopt the new requirements. Therefore,EPA is proposing that a State may request an extension for up to two years,if the State either has statutory or regulatory barriers to meeting thedeadline or temporarily lacks program capability to implement adequatelythe new requirements. Under the proposal, if a State anticipates submissionof a final request for approval of a program revision to EPA more than15 months after promulgation of the EPA regulation, the State would berequired to request an extension of the deadline before the expirationof the 15-month period.To obtain an extension, the State must demonstrate that it: (1) Is requestingthe extension to group two or more program revisions in a single legislativeor regulatory action or otherwise cannot meet the original deadline inspite of a good faith effort to do so; (2) is taking steps to adopt andimplement the new provisions within its existing authority; and (3) willdevelop the capability necessary to implement adequately the new provisions.The extension request must include a schedule setting forth when and howthe States will be able to adopt and effectively implement the new provisions.In granting the State an extension to the 18-month deadline, EPA wouldput itself in the position of directly implementing the new requirementuntil it finally approves the State's program revision. To minimize thedisruption in State program administration in these cases, EPA is proposingthat the State, as a condition of obtaining the extension, implement thefollowing interim measures, as they apply to the new regulations, duringthe extension period: Inform public water systems of the new requirementsand the fact that EPA will be overseeing implementation of the requirementuntil EPA approves the primacy program revision; collect and store laboratoryresults and other compliance data; conduct informal follow-up on violationsand assist EPA in development of enforcement actions; provide technicalassistance to public water systems; and provide EPA with all informationprescribed by andSection; 142.15 on State reporting.If a State's request for an extension is based on a temporary lack of programcapability to implement the new requirement, the rule would require theState to take steps to remedy the capability deficiency during the extensionperiod. Actions necessary to accomplish this would be determined case bycase considering the administrative, technical, and management areas tobe addressed. Such actions might include: (1) An increase in resourcesto the program; (2) training of existing staff; (3) development of Stateprocedures, guidelines, and policies to implement the new provisions; etc.The proposal would require the State to submit with its extension requesta plan to build State capability during the extension period. The extension request could be approved by EPA for a period not to exceedtwo years. The full extension period should be used only where there isa clear need for that long a period (e.g., when State legislative changesare required in States where the legislature meets infrequently). The proceduresfor EPA review and oversight of the State program during the extensionperiod would be developed State by State, within the general criteria outlinedin this section. The extension period would be limited to two years because of the needto limit the period during which States may continue to operate with partialprimacy. Even though a State would be implementing the new requirementswithin the limits of its authority and capabilities as a condition of theextension, EPA believes its policy of full primacy requires a fixed deadlinefor State adoption of the new requirements. Therefore, under the proposal,where a State has not obtained EPA approval of a program revision by thedeadline, EPA may initiate procedures leading to withdrawal of the primacyprogram. EPA intends to begin procedures leading to withdrawal of the primacyprogram if the State has not submitted an approval request for programrevisions in a timely manner. This is necessary to maintain EPA's ``fullprimacy'' policy. EPA invites comment on the proposed deadline, the criteria for EPA approvalof extension of the deadline, the length of the extension, and the conditionsa State must meet during the extension period. D. Content of a Request for EPA Approval of State Program Revisions (Section142.12(c)) Proposed andSection; 142.12(c) lists the contents of a State's request forEPA approval of a revision. The State request must include: (1) The same information required in an application for initial primacy,listed in andSection; 142.11(a), to the extent the items listed apply tothe request for approval of the program revision;(2) Any additional regulation-specific materials required for program changeswhere the State is given broad discretion to choose how to achieve theobjective of the regulation (these will be specified in andSection; 142.16);and (3) an Attorney General's statement that demonstrates that the Statehas adequate legal authority under its statute and regulations to carryout the program revision. (NOTE: As explained later, this proposal wouldamend the application requirements for initial primacy to require an AttorneyGeneral's statement. Thus, the third requirement above would be encompassedby the first.) These three requirements are explained in more detail below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Documentation Required Under Section 142.11(a) </ITAG>Under andSection; 142.11(a), a State request for initial primacy must includethe text of the State's statute and regulations (and a demonstration thatthey are no less stringent than the comparable EPA regulations); a descriptionof the State procedures for administration and enforcement of the regulations;a statement that the State will keep records as required by EPA; a copyof the State variance and exemption regulations (if any); and a descriptionof the State's plan for the provision of safe drinking water under emergencyconditions. EPA is proposing that an update of the same materials, as applicable,be included in State requests for approval of program revisions as well.The State would not be required to include materials listed in andSection;142.11(a) that are not directly related to the program revision under consideration.EPA may, however, request additional materials if needed in order to performa complete review of a specific program revision. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Additional Regulation-Specific Materials </ITAG>Section 142.16 (as amended by the revised public notification rule, see52 FR 41534, October 28, 1987) lists additional materials specific to anindividual EPA regulation that must be included in a State's request forapproval of that regulations. EPA anticipates that these regulations-specificrequirements will be necessary only where a new or revised EPA regulationgives the State discretion on how to implement certain requirements ofthe regulations. Since these primacy requirements will be specific to aregulation, they will be promulgated when the new or revised EPA regulationis promulgated. Currently, this section (andSection; 142.16) contains onlyspecial primacy requirements for State adoption of the revised public notificationrule promulgated on October 28, 1987 (52 FR 41524). Special primacy requirementshave also been proposed for the surface water treatment and coliform rules(52 FR 42178 and 42224, November 3, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Attorney General's Statement </ITAG>Under the proposed rule, a request for approval of a program revision wouldbe required to include an Attorney General's statement (or a statementfrom the attorney for the State primacy agency if it has independent legalcounsel). This statement would demonstrate that the State has adequatelegal authority under its statutes and regulations to implement the programrevision submitted to EPA for approval. The Attorney General's statementwould be required in all State requests for approval of program revisions,unless EPA has specifically waived the requirement as described below.The proposed rule would enable EPA to use its discretion to waive the requirementfor the Attorney General's statement in certain circumstances. EPA is proposingthat no waiver of the Attorney General's statement be available for Staterequests for approval of program revisions which adopt new or revised NPDWRsfor specific contaminants required under the 1986 SDWA amendments, forthe surface water treatment and disinfection requirements, and for thepublic notification rule. If EPA elects to waive the requirement for anAttorney General's statement in other cases not covered above, EPA wouldannounce this decision in the preamble to the federal regulation the Stateis to adopt. In the case of State-initiated changes, as discussed above,the State would be required to notify EPA of such changes. EPA would theninform the State whether or not a request for approval of the program revisionis required. In EPA's response, if an Attorney General's statement is notrequired, EPA would so state. If EPA required the State to submit a requestfor approval of the program revision, and was silent on the requirementfor an Attorney General statement, then an Attorney General's statementwould be required. The proposal would also amend andSection;142.11 to require a jurisdictionwhich applies for initial State primacy after promulgation of this regulationto submit an Attorney General's statement as part of its application. EPA has carefully considered the requirement for an Attorney General'sstatement. Although the Agency did not require an Attorney General's statementfor the primacy determinations made to date, it believes that there areclear and valid reasons for this new requirement. First, the program is now more complex because of the 1986 SDWA amendments.For the first ten years of its existence, the PWSS program was relativelystable. The basic regulatory requirements remained virtually unchangedfrom year to year, and almost all eligible States and territories appliedfor and received primacy soon after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passedin 1974. The program requirements were relatively clear and straightforwardto implement and to oversee. However, the 1986 amendments to the Act madesweeping changes in the scope and content of the PWSS program, transformingit into a more extensive and complex regulatory program. For example, asnoted above, the amendments mandate that EPA promulgate new drinking waterstandards for 83 contaminants by 1989 and standards for 25 additional contaminantsevery three years thereafter. Moreover, the amendments require EPA to promulgatea NPDWR establishing criteria where filtration is required as a treatmenttechnique for public water systems supplied by surface water sources anda NPDWR requiring disinfection for all systems. States will have to revisesignificantly their existing statutory and regulatory authorities to adoptthe new federal requirements. Many of the issues which will arise in theState preparation of program revisions and in EPA review of these revisionswill be legal ones; therefore, individuals in the State knowledgeable aboutState law and able to render a definitive legal opinion on the meaningof the State statutes and regulations should be involved in the revisionprocess. Second, the SDWA amendments strengthened EPA's enforcement authoritiesand mandated that the Agency strengthen its enforcement efforts for allinstances of noncompliance. Since in almost all cases primary enforcementresponsibility has been delegated to the States, the Agency has been activelyurging the States to take additional enforcement actions. EPA has alsoinitiated more federal enforcement actions to respond to noncomplianceand is following up in cases where the State is not taking action. EPAexpects this trend toward stronger enforcement to continue into the future.Further, as standards for additional contaminants are promulgated, enforcementefforts will become more complex. To ensure the success of this enhancedenforcement program, EPA must be certain that the States have adequateauthority under their laws and regulations to enforce the new standards.The Attorney General's statement in the State request for approval of aprogram revision would document this authority. Third, the Attorney General's statement would act as a guide or ``roadmap'' for EPA review of State program revisions, which would simplify andexpedite EPA's review. EPA envisions the ``road map'' to be primarily adirectory or side-by-side comparison of the federal regulations and thecorresponding State statutes and regulations. EPA would not require theAttorney General's statement to be submitted in any specific format; however,EPA would provide the States with samples and assist them in formattingthe statement if needed. Finally, and most importantly, the statement would demonstrate why theState laws and regulations give the State adequate authority to implementthe federal laws and regulations, and allow the State to explain any ambitiousprovisons in those statutes or regulations. By submitting the ``road map''and explanation of State law in the Attorney General's statement, the Statewould reduce the possibility that EPA will misinterpret State laws andregulations and determine that they are not adequate to implement the federalrequirements. Such a determination could result in failure to approve theprogram revision, or, at best, a long process whereby EPA would need torequest additional information and clarification from the State. This couldgreatly delay a final determination on a State application. The requirement for an Attorney General's statement would generally requirethe primacy agency to better coordinate its program revisions with theAttorney General. The Agency recognizes that this new requirement may increasethe administrative burden both to prepare requests for appoval of revisionsto current primacy programs and to apply for initial primacy for thoseentities which currently lack primary enforcement responsibility. However,EPA believes that the benefits of the statement, as described above, outweighany additional administrative burden. EPA considered whether there are alternatives to the requirement for anAttorney General's statement which might be less burdensome to the State,but which would still meet the basic needs as outlined above. Accordingly,EPA is requesting comments on the following alternative to the currentproposal. Under the alternative, a State's request for approval of a program revisionwould include a side-by-side comparison of the Federal requirements andthe corresponding State provisions (as described above) that is preparedby the State primacy agency; in the case, no Attorney General's statementwould be required with the request. EPA would review the documentationsubmitted by the State primacy agency and would then determine, case bycase, if the Attorney General's involvement was necessary. For example,the Attorney General's involvement would be necessary if there was ambiguousstatutory or regulatory provision that could be interpreted as inconsistentwith the Federal program. In such cases, EPA would request an AttorneyGeneral's statement to clarify the ambiguity. This option could lessenthe administrative burden of involving the Attorney General's office inthe process, at least initially. However, having to go back to the Stateand ask that the Attorney General prepare a statement could result in substantialdelays in approving State program revisions. If most requests for EPA approvalof program revisions involve legal issues that eventually require the AttorneyGeneral's participation, the benefits of this option would be small.EPA requests comment on the proposed requirement for an Attorney General'sstatement. Comments should address the proposed requirement as well asthe alternative presented here and should focus particularly on the usefulnessof the requirement for the Attorney General's statement in EPA's reviewand approval of State requests for program revisions and the impact onState programs.E. Procedures for Reviewing a State Request for EPA Approval of a StateProgram Revision (Section 142.12(d))Proposed andSection; 142.12(d) would establish procedures for State submissionof requests for approval of program revisions and for EPA review and decisionon these program revisions. It also would establish the public notice andpublic hearing requirements for EPA approval or disapproval of State programrevisions.The proposed procedures for State submission and EPA review of a Staterequest for approval of a program revision would be a two-step process,requiring that the State first submit a preliminary request (containinga draft of the materials listed in andSection; 142.12(c)) for EPA reviewand tentative determination. EPA's tentative determination would be subjectto public notice (and a public hearing if requested) for revisions deemed``substantial'' by the Administrator. Then, the State would submit a finalrequest (containing final and complete State materials) for formal EPAapproval or disapproval. The final State request would include, for example,State statutory and regulation changes already promulgated, a signed AttorneyGeneral's statement, and descriptions of any procedures and other administrativeprocesses already adopted and in place within the State.A summary of the procedures for review and approval of State requests isillustrated in the following chart.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 781</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Proposed andSection; 142.12(d)(1) would require the State to submit a preliminaryrequest for approval of a State program revision as soon as practicableafter EPA's promulgation of a new or revised regulation or EPA's determinationthat a primacy program revision is required for a State-initiated change.This preliminary request would, at a minimum, contain the information requiredin andSection; 142.12(c), <T3>in draft form, </T3>including any draft statutes and regulations anda draft Attorney General's statement, i.e., one not yet signed by the AttorneyGeneral (see Section D above). The information must be complete enoughto allow the Administrator to do a full review and make a tentative determinationon the adequacy of the proposed State program revision. No specific timeperiod for this first phase is proposed in the rule, to give EPA and theState flexibility to respond to the specific circumstances of each programrevision.It is strongly recommended that the State primacy agency work with theAttorney General's office in developing the program revision (especiallyany statutory or regulatory changes) to ensure that no major problems occurlater. The draft Attorney General's statement would contain the informationdescribed in Section D: A comparison between the federal and State regulationsto show that all necessary elements are present and an explanation of anyambiguous provisions in the State law. EPA would review this draft statementalong with the rest of the preliminary application materials and discussany needed changes or additions with State personnel. The statement submittedwith the final program revision application would be signed by the AttorneyGeneral (or his or her designee).The proposed requirement for a preliminary State submission and tentativeEPA determination is new. This change would formalize what has been standardpractice in the primacy review process both for initial primacy decisionsand for the program revision process for adoption of the national interimprimary drinking water regulations for trihalomethanes in 1979 and 1980,as well as in other Agency programs. EPA is proposing to make this preliminaryreview step a regulatory requirement for review of all future program revisionsto ensure that issues are identified early in the program revision processand that there is an opportunity to respond to EPA comments before EPAtakes any final action on State requests.Proposed andSection; 142.12(d)(1)(iii) would require EPA to publish noticein the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that it has made a tentative determination toapprove or disapprove a State program revision and to provide an opportunityto request a public hearing and submit comments. Public notice would onlybe required for program revisions that the Administrator determines are``substantial.'' EPA would transmit to the State for its considerationall the public comments and any changes to EPA's tentative determination.Public notice of the Administrator's preliminary determination on the Staterequest is also a new requirement; the current regulations for obtaininginitial primacy do not require public notice until after the Administratormakes his or her final decision. However, EPA believes that solicitingearly public comment, in conjunction with an early review by EPA of draftState program revisions, would help to prevent new issues from emerginglater in the process, e.g., after a State promulgates its regulations.The procedures for public notice and hearing would follow the existingprocedures in andSection; 142.13.The proposed rule does not define the specific criteria EPA will use todetermine which program revisions are ``substantial.'' However, EPA believesthat most of the State program revisions to adopt the new or revised NPDWRsrequired by the 1986 SDWA amendments would be deemed ``substantial.'' EPAwould determine which new or revised EPA regulations require a ``substantial''change to the existing primacy program at the time the EPA regulationsare promulgated. State-initiated revisions would be determined to be ``substantial''on a case-by-case basis by EPA, based on an evaluation of the impact thechange has on the existing primacy program.After EPA has transmitted the tentative determination and, for substantialchanges, all comments and changes resulting from the public notice process,proposed andSection; 142.12(d)(2) would require the State to submit a finalrequest for formal EPA approval of the State program revision. The finalrequest would contain complete information <T3>in final form</T3> for all the elements listed in andSection; 142.12(c),in accordance with EPA's tentative determination. For substantial changes,the final request would include the State response to all comments andchanges resulting from the public notice process. The information in thefinal request would include the relevant statutory authorities and regulationsand the signed Attorney General's statement, as well as the final materialsto meet the other requirements in andSection; 141.12(c).For program revisions deemed ``substantial'' by the Administrator, theproposed rule would require EPA to give public notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that a final determination has been made on theState request. This notice may take place after the 18-month deadline (orextended period) has elasped. If the final program revision is substantiallychanged from the preliminary State request and EPA's tentative determination,EPA may publish a public notice prior to its final decision requestingcomment and giving opportunity for another public hearing.EPA's disapproval of a State's final request for approval of a programrevision would likely require the State to re-promulgate its regulatorychanges or to modify other State procedures already in place to meet theconditions for approval. To avoid this, EPA strongly encourages early andactive EPA/State identification of issues and their resolution even inadvance of the preliminary State request. EPA expects that its tentativedetermination on the preliminary State request would establish the conditionsfor final approval. If EPA disapproves the final State request, however,the procedures proposed in andSection; 142.12(d)(1) and (2) would allow theState to submit supplemental materials. For revisions to implement newor revised EPA regulations (which have a deadline for final approval),the State could request an extention of the 18-month deadline to allowsufficient time for submission and review of the supplemental materials.If the State does not have an approved program revision within the 18-monthdeadline (or by the end of the approved extension period), the proposalwould require EPA to notify the State that it no longer meets the requirementsset forth in the rule for maintenance of primary enforcement authority.If the State did not take immediate steps to remedy the situation, EPAcould initiate procedures leading to program withdrawal as specified inproposed andSection; 142.17.EPA invites comment on all aspects of the procedures proposed for EPA'sreview and decision on State requests for approval of program revisions.F. Options for Addressing Minimum State Enforcement AuthoritiesBoth the Safe Drinking Water Act and the implementing regulations at andSection;142.10 require a State to have adequate procedures for the enforcementof its drinking water regulations in order to obtain and maintain primaryenforcement responsibility for the PWSS program. Under andSection; 142.10(b)(6)(vi),adequate procedures for the enforcement of drinking water regulations includeauthority to assess civil or criminal penalties for violation of the State'sprimary drinking water regulations.The current regulations in Part 142, however, do not specify any minimumpenalty authority. This was a major issue in the development of the initialprimacy regulations in 1976. At that time, EPA decided to require the Stateto have the legal authority to assess civil or criminal penalties for violations,but not to require the State to have any specific minimum penalty authority.While EPA, in the preamble to the original regulations (52 FR 2917, January20, 1976), strongly urged the States to adopt the same level of penaltiesas was available to EPA under the SDWA (up to $5,000 per day civil penaltyfor a willful violator), a lower penalty authority was not a bar to approvalof the State's program. The preamble did specify, however, that where lowerpenalty authority levels had a significant adverse effect on the adequacyof the State's enforcement program, EPA could require a State to raiseits penalty authority to retain primacy.EPA has been investigating current State enforcement authorities underthe PWSS program to determine whether it should propose amending the currentprimary requirements to require States to have enforcement authoritiesclose to or the same as EPA's enforcement authorities under the amendedSDWA. The 1986 SDWA amendments increased EPA's maximum civil penalty authorityfrom $5,000 to $25,000 per day and eliminated the requirement that a violationbe ``willful.'' See section 1414(b) of the SDWA. In addition, section 1414(a)was amended to give EPA authority to issue administrative orders and theauthority to assess administrative penalties up to $5,000, if the initialadministrative order is violated. The SDWA was also amended to requireEPA to take enforcement action where the State has not taken an appropriateenforcement action under its authorities in a timely manner.EPA has reviewed current State penalty authorities and their use. Thissurvey indicates that current civil penalty monetary amounts specifiedin State law range from zero in a few States to $25,000 per violation perday in several States. Specifically, of the 54 States and Territories withprimacy, four States have authority to assess fines for up to $25,000 perviolation per day, five States up to $10,000 per day, 17 States up to $5,000per day, seven States up to $1,000 per day, five States up to $500 perday, and the remaining 16 States either have no penalty amount specifiedor the penalty amounts in their State laws are not known.EPA believes that the availability and proper use of penalties does serveas a deterrent to violations in general and can be particularly effectivein ensuring compliance by recalcitrant systems. Although EPA is not explicitlyproposing any specific regulatory language to revise the primacy requirementsregarding penalty amounts in this rule, EPA is actively considering severaloptions:(1) Not specifying a penalty amount (i.e., leave the current requirementunchanged); (2) requiring States to have authority to assess penaltiesup to $5,000 per day (which would match the authority 26 States now have);(3) requiring States to have authority to assess penalties up to $25,000per day (which would match EPA's new authority); or (4) requiring Statesto have authority to assess penalties of some other specified amount withinthis range, based on comments received and further investigation. EPA requestscomment on the concept of requiring a specific minimum level of penaltyauthority for primacy and, if so, what that level should be. EPA also invitescomments on the factors it should consider in evaluating these options,including: (1) The potential benefits to the current State enforcementprogram; (2) the minimum penalty amount that would effectively encouragecompliance by public water systems; and (3) the difficulty for the Statesof adopting such a requirement.The 1986 SDWA amendments also added administrative order authority to EPA'smix of enforcement tools. All EPA environmental programs (except thoseunder the Clean Air Act) currently have some type of administrative enforcementauthority. In the PWSS program, EPA may assess an administrative penaltyonly for violation of a compliance order. The States in the PWSS program,in general, do not currently have administrative enforcement authority.The major advantage of administrative order authority, particularly whenit includes penalty authority, is that State Agency Directors may ordercompliance and assess penalties without resort to courts, thus expeditingwhat in many cases would be a longer, more resource-intensive process.EPA is concerned about requiring agencies to adopt administrative enforcementauthority, however, because generally State agencies do not have authoritiesand could not get them without State legislative changes. The State legislativechange may be difficult to obtain in many State legislatures without clearand convincing proof of its benefits.EPA requests comment on whether it should require States as a conditionof primacy to have, first, administrative order authority and, second,administrative penalty authority equivalent to EPA's authority. Commentsshould address the need when such authority in the Public Water SystemSupervision program, when such authority should be required, advantagesand uses of such authority, and the potential difficulties States may facein trying to meet such a requirement to obtain or retain primacy. EPA mayissue final regulations on State primacy requirements for civil penaltyamounts and State administrative order authority when it issues the finalprimacy regulations.G. Other Changes to Subpart BThe proposed rule would make other changes to various sections of Part142, Subpart B in addition to those necessary to restructure and conformthe rule language to accomodate the new section on State program revisions.Three of these changes are significant.<T3>State Adoption of BAT. </T3>The proposal would revise the primacy requirementsin andSection; 142.10 to amend paragraph (d), which relates to the varianceand exemption procedures. Under the 1986 SDWA amendments, EPA must promulgateits findings of best available technology (BAT) for the purpose of obtainingvariances at the time the new or revised NPDWR is promulgated. This noticeproposes to add a sentence that requires those States that currently allowvariances to adopt requirements no less stringent than EPA's findings ofBAT for use in the State's variance process. EPA is proposing this changebecause the BAT determination is an integral part of each primacy drinkingwater regulation to be adopted by the States, which, under Section 1413,must be ``no less stringent'' then EPA's new or revised NPDWR.<T3>Revision to State Reporting Requirements. </T3>The proposal includesa revision of the current regulations at andSection; 142.15 related to Statereporting. The proposal would require States to submit reports to EPA everyquarter. The reports would, at a minimum, contain updates of the State'sinventory of public water systems, information on violations and enforcementactions, and a summary of newly-granted variances and exemptions. Thiswould revise the current rule, which only requires information to be submittedannually and does not require information on enforcement actions. The proposalalso would require the State to notify EPA of any new variances and exemptionsgranted during the quarter. (The current rule simply requires ``prompt''notification.) This will put this requirement on the same schedule as theother State reports. Finally, the proposal would add a new paragraph toreserve space for special reports beyond the basic reporting requirements.These special reports may be required in new NPDWRS promulgated subsequentto this rule. For example, the proposed surface water treatment requirements(52 FR 42178, November 3, 1987) would amend andSection; 142.15 to requireinformation on which systems must install filtration. EPA is proposingto require a fixed interval (i.e., quarterly) for information on new variancesand exemptions, as well as reporting for all other information, to moreeffectively carry out the new Congressional directive for enhanced Federalenforcement of violations. EPA needs timely information on violations andState enforcement actions on an ongoing basis to meet this Congressionalmandate.<T3>Program Capability Considerations. </T3>The proposal would revise thecurrent program grant regulations (andSection; 35.410 and 35.415) and existingprimacy requirements (andSection; 142.10(b) and andSection; 142.15(a)) to explicitlyconsider program capability in the grant and primacy decision process.The revised grant regulations would require a State or Indian Tribe applyingfor an initial award under section 1443(a) of the Act to demonstrate thatit will be capable of establishing a public water system supervision programafter the initial grant period. For States, EPA would not approve an awarduntil the State demonstrates that it will be capable of implementing theprimacy requirements within one year of the initial award and agrees touse such funding to demonstrate such capability. For Indian Tribes, EPAwould not approve an award until the Indian Tribe demonstrates that itwill be capable of implementing the primacy requirements within three yearsof initial award and agrees to use at least one year's funding to demonstratesuch capability.The revised primacy regulations (andSection; 142.10(b)) would require a Statewanting to obtain or retain primacy to demonstrate that it is capable ofimplementing adequate procedures for the enforcement of the primacy program.Specifically, this change would apply to any State applying for initialprimacy. This change would also apply to requests for EPA approval of revisionsto existing primacy programs, to the extent a demonstration of programcapability is relevant to the program revision under consideration. Noexplicit criteria or ``thresholds'' are proposed in this rule for demonstrationof capability. For program revisions, in particular, the determinationof whether the State is capable of implementing adequate procedures toenforce the program revision will be case by case, depending on the management,technical, and administrative demands of the program revision at issueand the specific situation.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Request for Public Comment</ITAG>EPA requests public comments and information on all aspects of this proposal,including the specific issues identified in the preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Compliance with Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory agency determine whethera new regulation will be ``major'' and, if so, that the Agency conducta Regulatory Impact Analysis. A major rule is defined as a regulation whichis likely to result in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal agencies, State agencies, and geographical regions; or(3) A significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,production, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-based enterprisesto compete in domestic or export markets.Since the proposed rule does not meet the definition of a major regulation,the Agency has not conducted a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This proposed rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written commentsfrom OMB to EPA and any response to these comments will be available forviewing in the public docket for this rule at EPA, Room 1101ET, Washington,DC 20460.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have beensubmitted for approval to the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>An Information Collection Request document, ICR No. 0270.11,has been prepared by EPA and a copy may be obtained from Carla Levesque,Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M Street SW (PM-223); Washington, DC20460 or by calling (202) 382-2740. Submit comments on these requirementsto EPA at the address at the beginning of this notice and to the Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs; OMB; 726 Jackson Place NW., Washington,DC 20530; Attention: Tim Hunt. The final rule will respond to any OMB andpublic comments on the information collection requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that federal agencies prepare regulatoryflexibility analyses assessing the impacts of proposed rules on entitiessuch as small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.Such analysis is not required, however, when the head of an agency certifiesthat a proposed rule would not have a significant effect on a substantialnumber of small entities.EPA considers the information that would be required by this proposed ruleto be the minimum necessary to effectively administer oversight of Stateswhich plan to apply for or have been granted primacy for the PWSS programunder section 1413 of the SDWA. The proposal would establish new proceduresfor State submission of requests for EPA approval of program revisionsto current primacy programs. The proposal would also modify existing proceduresto require submission of an Attorney General's statement with the materialto be submitted by States applying for initial primacy.The impact of the administrative requirements under the proposed rule beyondthat already required of States to meet the statutory requirements forobtaining or retaining primacy would not be significant in any State. Section1413 of the statute requires States to adopt drinking water regulationsno less stringent than EPA regulations, to adopt adequate procedures forthe enforcement of there regulations, and to meet other requirements forthe administration of a State program. This proposed rule would not requireStates to collect information beyond that already required to comply withthe statutory requirements.The proposed rule would apply to all States applying for initial primacyor requesting EPA to approve revisions for existing primacy programs. Theadditional workload in any State because of these administrative requirementswould not be significant relative to the total State workload requiredto obtain or retain primacy. Accordingly, I certify that these proposedrules, if promulgated, would not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The Agency seeks comments and any additionalinformation related to the potential impact of these proposed rules onsmall entitities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 35 and 142</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
