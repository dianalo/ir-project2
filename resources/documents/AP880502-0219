Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi took the step out of concern thatarms that might no longer be needed in Afghanistan would find theirway to Sikh militants fighting to secede from India and form anation of their own.   Afghanistan is on the other side of Pakistan from here.   India has accused Pakistan of facilitating what it calls``narco-terrorism,'' by which the Sikh militants buy arms withmoney from heroin smuggling. Pakistan denies the allegation.   Gandhi ordered 3,000 more men to police the border in Punjab,raising the frontier force to 18,000. He also directed the Punjabstate government to begin building a barbed-wire fence along thefrontier.   But some border-guard officials doubt this can stop all illegaltraffic.   ``Sealing the border is not like licking and sealing anenvelope,'' said Jasmer Singh, a senior officer in India's BorderSecurity Force. ``It is impossible to completely stop trans-bordermovement.''   The Punjab-Pakistan border is 340 miles long.   Smuggling has long been prevalent in the region. Pakistan'slower-priced gold and textiles, for example, find eager markets inIndia.   In recent years, the smugglers have added narcotics andautomatic rifles.   Sikh militants, allegedly involved as both smugglers and buyers,need the arms to sustain their six-year guerrilla campaign for aSikh homeland. So far this year, they have killed more than 800people.   Punjab police say most of the killings have been carried outwith Chinese-made AK-47 rifles diverted from the Afghan rebels.Since last early this year, the Sikh extremists have addedrocket-propelled grenades and shoulder-fired, anti-aircraftmissiles to their arsenal.   President Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan has denied giving aid orsupport to the Sikh militants. Gandhi nonetheless still maintainsthat Pakistan both harbors the extremists and even provides coverfire when they make border crossings.   The area's rugged terrain makes the frontier difficult to seal.   In some places, as here in Dhinda on the northern-most tip ofPunjab, farmers on both sides cultivate land right up to theborder, which often is marked only by a short white pillar.   Singh, the border security officer, said: ``How can we stop twofarmers sharing a hookah (pipe) and exchanging packets?''   In other border areas, six-foot elephant grass makes clandestinemovement easy. At some places, river valleys and shiftingtributaries make it difficult to even determine where the border is.   India's policing efforts include observation towers a littleover a mile apart. Patrols stay within 500 yards of each other andafter dark, border troops use night-vision binoculars andsearchlights.   But the searchlights sometimes lose electric power, said ChamanLal, a deputy-inspector general in the border force.   ``We suspect it is arranged,'' he added. He said the governmentshould provide separate power lines for the searchlights instead ofrelying on connections from border villages.   D. S. Kalha, the district commissioner at Gurdaspur, one ofthree Punjab districts bordering Pakistan, talked of even moreelaborate projects in store to seal the border.   ``The government plans to ban cultivation up to 500 meters(1,640 feet) from the border and create a no mans land,'' he said.``Later, this area will be fenced off and mined.''   Even if security measures succeed in Punjab, smugglers havealternative routes to India.   Jasmer Singh noted that the border in Gujarat state to the southcuts through hard-to-patrol swamps, while in neighboring Rajasthanstate it passes through desert.   ``They can bring arms through Rajasthan, where observation postsare set at least eight kilometers (about five miles) apart,'' hesaid. ``All they need is a fast camel. And they have faster camelsthan we have.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs May 6</NOTE></DOC>
