As the hand-picked successor of President Chun Doo Hwan, he's the odds-on favorite -- many would say the shoo-in -- to be the next president of South Korea. But because the Chun government seized power in a military coup, it is seen as illegitimate by most Koreans, and as its heir, Mr. Roh inherits the same stigma. To win a real mandate that will permit him to govern this society, he needs the legitimacy that can come only from a genuinely contested election. And he knows it.    &quot;The best way to solve legitimacy is to have a fair and free election,&quot; he said in an interview shortly before his nomination. &quot;If politicians really believe in parliamentary democracy, then they should participate in this election. The opposition has disappointed me, but I don't give up.&quot;    As his remarks indicate, Mr. Roh is in the paradoxical position of being more concerned about encouraging the opposition to field a candidate than about his own campaign.    Many Koreans believe that in a free and fair election, Mr. Roh and the ruling Democratic Justice Party have a solid chance of defeating the opposition, which is devoid of charismatic leaders and almost as unpopular as the government. But the opposition is threatening to boycott the election because it doesn't provide for direct election of a president but, rather, offers a parliamentary system where the winning majority party would select a leader.    (The government must also contend with increasingly violent street demonstrations. Tens of thousands of protestors, chanting &quot;Democracy&quot; and fighting police with firebombs and fists attacked government buildings and police stations, ripped up sidewalks for ammunition, and beat policemen in Seoul and at least 19 other cities in what the Associated Press described as the largest anti-government protests since President Chun took power in 1980.    (Hundreds of people, including policemen, were injured, and hundreds of people were arrested. The protesters timed their protests to coincide with the ruling party's meeting to confirm Mr. Roh's nomination. Several police units were overrun by hordes of protesters shouting, &quot;Down with the military dictatorship.&quot;)    In the hourlong interview, Mr. Roh openly acknowledged his problem and talked enthusiastically, if imprecisely, about &quot;democratic reforms&quot; that might woo the opposition to the polls. He clearly hopes to split Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung, two opposition leaders who have banded together at least temporarily. Mr. Roh said he views the more moderate Kim Young Sam as a &quot;hostage&quot; of the more radical Kim Dae Jung. He said: &quot;The first thing we have to do is rescue him from this hostage situation. The prospect may not be good, but I will try everything.&quot;    Mr. Roh came across as direct, thoughtful and unpretentious. By background he is a military man, a former four-star general. But unlike his old classmate, President Chun, who is often viewed as insular and arrogant, Mr. Roh picked up a layer of international polish as the organizer of Seoul's successful Asian Games last September.    A small, trim man with a firm handshake and a shy smile, Mr. Roh relaxes by swimming and playing tennis, sometimes as partner to his avid tennis-playing wife. In informal situations he speaks English, acquired during a stint at Fort Bragg, N.C.; he has a daughter studying at the University of Chicago.    Perhaps as a result, Mr. Roh seems to know what the West wants to hear. He spoke articulately about his desire to lead Korea toward more democracy.    &quot;I'm disappointed we haven't had a constitutional revision,&quot; he said. &quot;I would like to do so as soon as possible after the 1988 Olympics,&quot; scheduled to take place in Seoul.    But he insisted that he can't set a deadline for revising Korea's constitution to incorporate more democracy. &quot;We have an opposition to deal with, so naming a specific date isn't practical. Constitutional revision requires agreement among politicians and with people,&quot; he said.    Still, he insisted that he is determined to take some more immediate steps to enhance press freedom and reform the electoral process &quot;to make it fair and to increase the chance of persuading the opposition to participate.&quot;    Asked if he feels like a man on a tightrope -- having to woo alienated opposition politicians into the race without alarming military hard-liners into precipitating yet another coup -- he laughed softly and said: &quot;I'm not walking a tightrope; the economic progress and social stability of a growing middle class all make my political path a highway, not a tightrope.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
