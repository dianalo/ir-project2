Analysts said the most significant product was the DecStation3100, a fast workstation for scientists, engineers and financialanalysts that will compete with models from Sun Microsystems Inc.,Apollo Computer Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and others.   The DecStation 3100 is a breakthrough because of its speed andbecause it cannot run software written for Digital's Vax computerline. It runs a version of Unix, an industry-standard operatingsystem.   ``Up until this point they have maintained that the Vaxarchitecture is the be-all and end-all of the computer world,'' saidGregory Cline, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston. ``Ithink it's a smart move,'' Cline said.   The DecStation 3100, which Digital billed as ``the world'sfastest desktop workstation,'' begins at $11,900. Cline and otheranalysts said Digital's leadership claim is probably valid, but saidDigital could itself be leapfrogged soon by companies such as Sun.   Digital also introduced a line of slower workstations that do runits Vax operating system and a line of industry-standard personalcomputers made to its design by Tandy Corp. However, the personalcomputers are not capable of using DEC Windows, so programs that runon the PCs will not look the same as programs running on otherDigital computers.</TEXT></DOC>
