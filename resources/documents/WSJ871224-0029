For every Wall Street analyst saying &quot;sell,&quot; there's a bull who has reasons why any particular company or industry wouldn't really suffer in a slowdown.    Even in recession, bulls say, life goes on as usual for many companies. Folks still consume Seagram wine coolers and go to Disney theme parks, where they drink Diet Coke in paper cups.    Many analysts also have reasons for touting cyclical industrial companies that aren't generally considered recession-proof. Phelps Dodge will thrive thanks to tight commodity supplies, they say. If building materials have a slump in 1988, no matter, they add. Deferred demand will build up, helping 1990's profit. If all else fails, they say, the recession risk is already in the stocks.    Analysts, of course, need something to sell even in uncertain markets. Thus, they &quot;tend to go with a concept&quot; without dwelling on risks, says Linda Newman of Atalanta Capital, a money manager and former analyst at the same firm. But risks often aren't fully factored into stock prices ahead of bad news, she adds.    Currently, the sum total of analysts' 1988 profit estimates for Sandamp;P 500 companies is $23.70 a share, a 28% gain over 1987 estimates, says Dirk van Dijk of Institutional Brokers Estimate System. That implies a market price-earnings ratio of 10.7 -- roughly where stocks might sell amid a recession, according to a recent E.F. Hutton study.    But Wall Street economists aren't so sanguine. They put 1988 Sandamp;P profit at $19.55 a share and see only a 12% gain. The gap partly reflects different ways of calculating the two forecasts, IBES' Mr. van Dijk says, but also reflects analysts' greater optimism. The economists' more bearish forecast implies a higher market P-E ratio that might not fully reflect recession risk.    What's more, industry profit doesn't usually rise in recession. After-tax corporate profit in 1975 fell to $71 billion from 1974's $85 billion; it fell in 1982 to $115 billion from 1981's $144 billion, Commerce Department data shows.    When analysts tout stocks as recession-proof, they sometimes overlook business problems. Until recently, analysts generally saw Fort Howard's profit as doubling in the current quarter and as rising 25% in 1988 on steady sales of high-margin tissue, Lily Tulip cups and the like. But last week, Chairman Paul Schierl said the forecasts were &quot;overly ambitious.&quot;    Among others, Morgan Stanley's Tom Clephane dropped his 1988 estimate to $2.75 a share from $3.05 a share. The company's problems: higher polystyrene costs and a difficult &quot;learning curve&quot; in assimilating recent acquisitions, he says.    Some bulls on cyclical groups have to look as far out as 1989. A housing slump is ultimately bullish for building material suppliers like American Standard, First Boston analyst Laurence Hirschhorn recently told clients.    The slump creates &quot;a backlog of deferred housing demand&quot; that becomes &quot;effective housing demand&quot; when consumer confidence returns, he said. Thus, he thinks building material stocks should be bought, not sold, once recession strikes. He couldn't be reached yesterday.    Concerns like Walt Disney and MCA Inc. are widely touted as recession-proof because everybody likes to have fun. However, says First Boston analyst Roy Hong, &quot;it's got to be the quality of product&quot; that drives entertainment stocks.    He isn't recommending MCA. &quot;Its strength is one-hour action TV programs like 'Miami Vice,'&quot; whose popularity seems to be waning, he says. A perennially rumored takeover candidate, MCA rose 1 7/8 to 35 1/2 yesterday on renewed speculation.    Mr. Hong has a buy on Disney, but admits &quot;a key issue is theme-park attendance&quot; providing 70% of operating profit. Attendance fell as much as 5% in past recessions, he says. A Disney executive says she expects foreign visitors and locals to keep coming.    Commodity-related stocks are causing analysts most problems. Post-crash, Morgan Stanley's Mr. Clephane cut his estimate for the commodity paper group's 1988 profit gain to 8% from 33%, fearing scheduled price boosts might not stick. But he continued to recommend the stocks. He says their low P-E ratios are factoring in an even worse outcome than slower profit growth in 1988-a sharp profit decline.    Come the new year, Mr. Clephane says he may raise estimates again for concerns like Union Camp, Bowater and Stone Container. Prospects for price increases now look less bleak, he says.    Analysts who watch commodity concerns sometimes err on both the demand side and the supply side of the equation, says Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland, a New York brokerage.    Currently, Chevron and Mobil are popular recommendations. They're often recession-resistant because &quot;people have to heat their homes and drive their cars,&quot; Mr. Gaines says. But he thinks it's too early to buy oil stocks. They might sell off on signs of a warm winter or of an economic slowdown, which would hurt energy consumption, he says.    On the supply side, the stocks might weaken on fears of a surge in Mexican or Chinese oil output, which would further depress oil prices, he says. Nobody knows if the oil cartel can get its act together, he adds. Oil stocks were strong yesterday on firming oil prices.    Meanwhile, copper prices have soared, aiding those stocks. But some people wonder how long copper will be in short supply. Auto makers and builders, two big copper users, don't generally do well in slumps, they note. </TEXT></DOC>
