Mr. Gohlke, former head of West Germany's railways, saidhe was leaving his post because of differences with fellowboard members over how best to fulfill the job. But WestGerman sources said Mr. Gohlke was increasingly impatientwith the unwillingness of Western industry to invest in theEast. Mr. Gohlke also has complained about resistance withinthe East German trust agency, known as the Treuhandanstalt,from holdover employees from the former communist government.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the rapid collapse of East Berlin's governmentcontinued with the withdrawal of the Social Democrats fromthe post-communist ruling coalition. Analysts said that bybolting, the Social Democrats would accelerate the movetoward formal German unity, currently expected by Dec. 2.   The political crisis in East Berlin is likely tofundamentally alter relations between the two Germangovernments. Until now, there seemed a good chance that thetwo sides could get an agreement that maintained the illusionof unifying two equal partners.   But now that their government has crumbled, the EastGermans are likely to simply declare themselves out ofexistence by joining the West. In that case, West German lawswould extend to East Germany and the country would begoverned by a set of interim regulations until formal unityafter the Dec. 2 all-German elections. And even that datecould be advanced: The Social Democrats are vowing to seek avote in the East German parliament this week to accelerateGerman unity to mid-September.   The resignation of Mr. Gohlke comes as doubts are growingover the East German government's ability to carry through anaggressive economic reform program. Having committed itselfto the ultimate goal of German unification, East Berlin ishard-pressed to make difficult or unpopular decisions.   &quot;There's hardly any state authority left in East Berlin tocarry through on any decisions,&quot; said one West Germanofficial. The resignation of Mr. Gohlke &quot;is just another signof that weakness.&quot;   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said Mr.Gohlke would be succeeded by Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, headof Hoesch AG, the big West German steel concern. Mr.Rohwedder, a former official in Bonn's Finance Ministry,already is head of the trust agency's supervisory board.   Mr. Rohwedder met yesterday with West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl, presumably to discuss strategies for dealingwith East German economic problems.   The trust agency is trying to determine which of EastGermany's 8,000 companies can be salvaged and is arrangingfor temporary financing to allow most of the companies tocontinue functioning.   The two Germanys merged their economies on July 1, butmost East German companies appear unable to compete in thenew competitive environment without special assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
