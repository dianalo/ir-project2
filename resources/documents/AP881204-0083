LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Higher oil prices from OPEC's latest accord shouldspur the development of new North Sea oilfields that Britishcompanies now find too expensive to exploit, analysts say.   But the agreement may have little overall effect on the Britisheconomy, despite the fact that Britain is one of the world's majoroil producers.   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesreached an oil output agreement last week aimed at boosting crudeoil prices by at least 40 percent in 1989. The six-month accord,which takes effect in January, sets a total output level of 18.5million barrels a day and a target price of $18 a barrel.   The analysts said there was no chance that Britain would joinother non-OPEC producers, including Mexico and Norway, incooperating with OPEC by voluntarily cutting back production.   Norway, the other major North Sea oil producer, has told Britainit plans to continue a voluntary 7.5 percent production cut itimposed last year even though its production is rising because ofnew fields coming into operation, said a government source, speakingon condition he was not identified.   ``This Conservative government we've got at the moment is veryhostile to OPEC,'' said Fergus MacLeod, energy analyst at Barclaysde Zoete Wedd Ltd. ``I think a Labor government would considercooperating with OPEC along the lines of Norway, but not underMargaret Thatcher.''   He said the major impact of the OPEC agreement will be ``higheraverage oil prices in 1989 than would otherwise be the case and agreater confidence that oil prices will not stabilize in singledigits.   ``That means that some of the North Sea developments which aremarginal at current oil prices are likely to go ahead,'' MacLeodsaid.   Gareth Lewis-Davies, an Edinburgh-based analyst for theinvestment firm County NatWest WoodMac, said: ``A high oil price isgood for oil companies. And that means some new developments whichwere uneconomic are now going to be economic.''   The Department of Energy said it had approved the development of24 new fields, at an investment cost of more than $5 billion in 1988_ a record number.   ``It's good news,'' said Lewis-Davies, ``but these are generallysmall fields and the amount of oil is getting less and less.''   Britain now produces about 2.3 million barrels a day and ranks asthe world's seventh largest oil producer behind the Soviet Union,the United States, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Iran, he said.   This would make one believe that higher oil prices would benefitBritain, Lewis-Davies said, but because oil plays such a small partin the economy, lower oil prices are more beneficial to the majorityof business and industry.   ``The critical thing,'' he said, ``is whether the United Kingdomis an oil country and whether sterling is a petrocurrency, and theanswer I think is no.''   ``Only a very small percentage of Britain's gross domesticproduct is derived from oil. Similarly, capital investment in oil isonly a small percentage of the whole. So, a low oil price has helpedthe rest of Britain's non-oil economy,'' he said.   The OPEC agreement will have little impact on Britain's tradedeficit and inflation rate, said Bill Martin, chief economist at theinvestment firm Phillips and Drew Ltd.   Even a $5 hike in oil prices would only cut Britain's expected$28 billion current account deficit in 1988 by about $925 millionand add a 0.25 percentage point to the inflation rate, which is nowat 6.4 percent, he said. The current account includes invisibletrade such as services.   ``This is not significant,'' Martin said.   The analysts agreed that the major impact on North Sea productionhad been the July explosion and fire on Occidental Petroleum's PiperAlpha platform in the North Sea, which killed 167 people.   The disaster took a major oilfield out of operation, whichLewis-Davies said has resulted in a 16 percent drop in expected 1988production.   ``Oil production in Britain is not readily affected by the priceof oil, the reason being that the price of producing in the NorthSea is way below the price at the moment,'' he said.   A recent County Natwest WoodMac survey found that 95 percent ofBritish oil production costs less than $7.40 a barrel, includingabout 60 percent which costs $3.70 or less, he said.   Brent crude, the main blend of North Sea oil, was selling for$14.50 a barrel on Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
