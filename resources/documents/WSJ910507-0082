Consider the alternative. Figure that under a free-marketsystem the mainland Chinese might be earning somewhere in theballpark of their Taiwan free-market cousins. Say, about$10,000 a year. Take half that, or $5,000, just to guardagainst overestimating. Subtracting China's currentper-capita annual income of about $350, that means a trulycapitalist China would this past year have earned about$4,650 per person more than it did. Multiply that by China's1.1 billion people, to get a probable loss in 1990 alone --due to communism -- of some $5.1 trillion.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
