Work at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) is in progressto investigate the potential of high-temperature (1100 to 1300 K) fluidized-bedgasification of shale fines (andless;3 mm size) using steam and oxygen as atechnique for more complete utilization of the resource. Synthesis gasproduced from fines gasification can be used for making some of the hydrogenneeded in the HYTORT process. After completing laboratory-scale batchand continuous gasification tests with several Eastern oil shales, twotests with Indiana New Albany shale were conducted in a 0.2 m diameterfluidized-bed gasification process development unit (PDU). A conceptualgasifier design for 95% carbon conversion was completed. Gasificationof 20% of the mined shale can produce the hydrogen required by the HYTORTreactor to retort 80% of the remaining shale. 12 refs., 1 fig., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
