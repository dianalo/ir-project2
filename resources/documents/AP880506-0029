They claimed the strike was not ended by Thursday's raid, asauthorities claimed, and said police hurt at least 32 people in theaction.   A priest who was present said many strikers were brutally beaten.   In a statement issued afterwards, strike committee members whohad gone into hiding called on plant workers to stay home: ``Thebrutal actions by the ZOMOs (riot troops) and the SB (secretpolice) did not break our strike.''   Before the riot squads moved in, plainclothesmen had rousted thestrikers from sleep with deafening percussion grenades.   Strikers said a protest march against the raid occurred on plantgrounds Thursday morning and that as soon as police left manylaborers refused to work.   The statement from strike leaders said that although theirdemands for higher wages, free trade unions and the reinstatementof fired union activists had not changed, their main concern nowwas for strikers arrested in the raid.   ``We have a moral duty to fight for their immediate release,''it said.   Strike committee sources said committee chairman AndrzejSzewczuwaniec had worked out an evacuation plan in the event of araid.   They said he and five other members of the 16-member committeeescaped. The government said 38 people in all were seized duringthe two-hour police action.   ``The whole thing took place without one bruise,'' governmentspokesman Jerzy Urban told The Associated Press. ``Nobody sufferedany harm or injury.''   But several people present said police beat strikers afterblocking exits from a building where the strike committee was based.   The Rev. Tadeusz Zaleski was with the strikers during the raid.Police later turned him over to Roman Catholic Church officials.   Zaleski said ``riot police were beating with very long heavysticks.''   Some strikers ``were chased and beaten. The riot police werevery brutal and on many occasions beat people who already had beencaught,'' the priest added.   Zaleski said police ``totally demolished'' the strike center,emptying closets, breaking windows and tossing around belongings.He said his vestments were scattered and the altar where he saidMass for workers was destroyed.   Zygmunt Lenyk of the conservative opposition group Confederationof Independent Poland said 32 people suffered cuts, eight peoplewere left unconscious and one man's legs were broken.   Strike sources said they were especially angry because theattack came after management, apparently scheming to catch strikersoff guard, had just agreed to meet with the strike committee forthe first time in a week.   Anna Mach, whose husband Maciej is on the strike committee, saidhe called her at 1 a.m. Thursday and expressed relief thatmanagement agreed to meet with the committee and Catholic mediatorsat 8 a.m.   One strike source said that at 7 a.m., about 1,500 workers beganmarching on the management building to protest the raid but weredispersed by police.   Workers leaving the plant during an afternoon shift changeThursday told Western reporters that some people inside the millhad resumed striking.   The state-run news agency PAP said plant operations were beingrestored but were hampered by up to 40 percent absenteeism, whichit blamed in part on threats by strikers against people who wantedto work.   The strike at the 32,000-worker steel mill began April 26 andtalks broke off when it was declared illegal two days later. Strikeleaders had claimed half the workforce was participating.</TEXT></DOC>
