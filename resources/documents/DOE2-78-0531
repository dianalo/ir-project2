<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0531 </DOCNO><TEXT>A test program was designed and conducted to determine the effectivenessof various technical countermeasures in reducing the fuel economy penaltyassociated with operation of road vehicles at low ambient temperatures,specifically during transient warmup conditions. The technical countermeasuresevaluated were: exhaust heated engine coolant; exhaust heated passengercompartment; and use of various oils with additives to reduce their viscosities.Three vehicles of identical basic cofiguration were utilized for thistest program. Each vehicle was modified so that it could be tested inbase configuration and also with one or two test variables over a rangeof ambient temberatures from +20/sup 0/C to -20/sup 0/C in 10/sup 0/C+ intervals. Each countermeasure and base configuration were tested ineach temperature range with up to four or five test replicates whenevertest conditions and instrumentation function would allow. A total of140 successful tests were conducted during the program in addition toothers which were rendered invalid. Various temperatures, fuel flow andvehicle speed were measured during each test. One of the countermeasures(Flo-Tech engine oil additive) produced a significant decrease in fuelconsumption and a second countermeasure (030 oil) produced a noticeabledecrease in fuel consumption relative to 10W30 oil. One other countermeasure(exhaust heated coolant), while not producing a significant decreasein fuel consumption, did produce a potentional improvement in heater/defrosteroperation and passenger subjective comfort by increasing coolant warmuprate. Two other countermeasures (5W30 oil and heater system coolant bypass)did not exhibit a significant decrease in fuel consumption. 28 figs.,16 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
