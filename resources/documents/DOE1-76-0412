Strategies developed byindividual refiners and marketers in response to this changing environmentwill determine their future in the industry. In developing scenariosfor the downstream, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), hasidentified three forces that will determine the downstream playing fieldin the nineties: 1. Imbalances between market demands and refinery capacitywill continue to promote intense competition and to depress margins,2. Product and crude price volatility will be at least as great in thefuture as it has been in the last three years and 3. Renewed environmentalconcerns will add new capital investment burdens to the industry. Theimplications of these three forces on refiners are clear - being in thedownstream business is likely to become increasingly expensive, competitiveand risky. The author shares CERA's perspective on why these forces haveevolved and, in turn, led to new strategies and developments in the industry.Then he outlines how we think these new themes may affect players inthe industry. Finally, he summarizes some key uncertainties the futureholds.</TEXT></DOC>
