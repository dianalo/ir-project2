DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors launched a ``surgical''strike against the nation's largest labor union, announcing aracketeering lawsuit to break the Mafia's alleged domination of theTeamsters.   Spokesmen for the 1.6 million-member union called the civilracketeering suit ``a vicious anti-labor attack'' and saidallegations of ties to organized crime were ``pure myth.''   Hours after the lawsuit was filed Tuesday here, Teamsterspresident Jackie Presser was readmitted to a Cleveland hospital,where he was in serious condition today. Presser had brain tumorsurgery last month.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani stressed that ``this lawsuit isnot in any sense an attack on trade unionism or on the many, manyTeamsters who are honest, hard-working people.''   ``We are not seeking overall control of the Teamsters union,''Giuliani said. ``This is a use of the racketeering statute in asurgical way to attempt to take back from the Mafia the Teamstersunion.''   Giuliani and Teamsters lawyer John Climaco sparred over the suiton morning news shows today. The two shouted at each other onNBC-TV's ``Today'' show, and on CBS-TV's ``This Morning,'' eachaccused the other side of un-American activities.   ``That's the political demagoguery and posturing that goes on ina situation like this. ... It is not un-American to try to have aunion operated democratically rather than tyranically. It seems tome it's un-American to let that go on year after year, decade afterdecade,'' Giuliani said.   Climaco acknowledged that there are ``individual associations''between Teamsters and organized crime, but he insisted that ``theTeamsters union doesn't condone corruption'' or ``criminalactivity.''   The suit is ``un-American, it's contrary to our philosophy ofgovernment'' and American labor policy, Climaco said.   The U.S. District Court lawsuit charged that Teamsters leadersmade ``a devil's pact'' with the Mafia, insuring the elections oftop officers, including Presser and his predecessor, Roy Williams.   Organized crime ``has deprived union members of their rightsthrough a pattern of racketeering that includes 20 murders, anumber of shootings, bombings, beatings, a campaign of fear,extortion and theft and misuses of union funds,'' Giuliani said.   Court papers noted that four of the last five Teamsterspresidents have faced federal felony charges and three wereconvicted: David Beck for embezzlement; James ``Jimmy'' Hoffa forobstructing justice and mail fraud, and Williams for trying tobribe a U.S. senator.   The government wants a federal judge to remove from office anyTeamsters officers found to have violated federal racketeeringlaws. It also seeks appointment of a union trustee to ensure fairunion elections.   Named as defendants were: the International Brotherhood ofTeamsters; its general executive board as a group; the executiveboard's 18 members and one former member as individuals; 26 allegedmembers or associates of the Mafia; and the mob's ruling``Commission'' as a group.   Twenty-five of those 26 defendants have been convicted ofTeamsters-related crimes such as labor peace extortion, embezzlingunion funds or taking labor payoffs. The board consists of Presser;Weldon Mathis, the secretary-treasurer and acting president; and 16vice presidents.   Judge David N. Edelstein granted the government a temporaryrestraining order that bars the board from making largeexpenditures of union funds or destroying union records. The orderalso banned the 25 previously convicted mob defendants fromparticipating in union affairs.   A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.   Prosecutors have used the federal racketeering laws to uprootcorruption in union locals and businesses, but it was the firsttime the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act was usedagainst an entire union.   Mathis condemned the lawsuit as ``a vicious anti-labor attack.''Two U.S. senators and the AFL-CIO, of which the Teamsters is amember, said the lawsuit overstepped government authority.   The AFL-CIO, which the Teamsters rejoined in October after 30years, issued a statement calling it ``a clear abuse of thegovernment's prosecutorial power and ... if sustained, wouldundermine a free trade union movement.''   ``It's pure myth that this organization is in any way influencedor controlled by organized crime,'' Climaco said at a newsconference in Montreal.   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the SenateLabor and Human Resources Committee, said the suit sets ``aterrible precedent.''   ``I don't think the government or any court in this nation iscapable of being a trustee over a union,'' he said.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., also criticized the move.   At the Justice Department, Attorney General Edwin Meese IIIcalled the lawsuit ``a very carefully developed, you might call italmost legally surgical step to remove the corrupt influences fromthe Teamsters.''   Meese said he had no apologies for President Reagan's acceptanceof Teamsters support in the 1980 presidential campaign, sayingthere had been no evidence at the time of any links to organizedcrime.   Among the 26 alleged Mafia members or associates named in thecivil action were the reputed heads of six mob families in NewYork, Chicago and Milwaukee.   They included convicted crime family boss Anthony ``Fat Tony''Salerno of the Genovese group who was convicted in 1986 of sittingon the ``commission'' that ruled the U.S. Mafia since Prohibition.</TEXT></DOC>
