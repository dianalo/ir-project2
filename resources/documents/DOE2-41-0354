The primary objective of the project is the investigationof the structural and reactivity changes occurring in metal/metal oxidesorbents used for desulfurization of hot coal gas during sulfidationand regeneration, with particular emphasis placed on the effects of thesechanges on the sorptive capacity and efficiency of the sorbents. Thefollowing tasks have been identified in the project: Conversion vs TimeStudies during Sulfidation and Regeneration; Pore Structure EvolutionStudies during Sulfidation and Regeneration; Intraparticle DiffusionStudies; Development of Structural Models for Hot Coal Gas DesulfurizationSorbents; and Development of Mathematical Models for Fixed-Bed DesulfurizationReactors. Research efforts primarily focused on Tasks 1 and 5. A summaryof the work done follows. 10 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
