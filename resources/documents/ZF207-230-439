 But knowingother languages is only one hurdle on the track to developing systems andapplications for international markets.andP;  BY KRISTI COALEandM;Ethnic is in.andP;  Even if you're not considered ethnic, you can participate in``ethnicity'' by dining at the latest Cambodian or Ethiopian restaurant andlearning a bit about the culture.andP;  The Mac is a participant in this latesttrend of using foreign languages.andP;  Realizing the Mac's potential for sellingin foreign markets, Apple has branched out to such countries as France,Belgium, and Japan, to name a few.andP;  Because of this move, software companieshave had to be more concerned with understanding foreign languages andcultures.andM;Some companies like Symantec and Microsoft have already followed Apple intothe foreign markets.andP;  They have embraced the notion that the Mac should beaccessible to everyone, regardless of the local language, and they have beenworking hard to accommodate these complex language needs.andP;  The relationshipbetween Apple and these companies is symbiotic.andP;  To push more Macs intoforeign markets, software must be readily available.andP;  Similarly, for thesecompanies to sell any software, the Mac must be present in the market.andM;The most common packages available on the international market are wordprocessors and page-layout programs.andP;  Word, MacWrite, PageMaker,Ready,Set,Go! and QuarkXpress are all available in international versionsincluding French, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and Spanish.andP;  Aldus recentlycame out with a Kanji PageMaker, and by the time this issue hits the stands,Quark will enter its addition to the Kanji line of page-layout programs.andP;  Andthey are not the only players in the move toward Mac internationalization.andO;Even you small developers (relative to the major companies) can put togethera foreign  package, but you have some issues to consider.andM;How would you accommodate non-Roman alphabets?andP;  Does Apple have someprovisions for differently scripted alphabets?andP;  If so, how can you, as anindependent developer, obtain them?andP;  If you're a prospective developer orjust interested in foreign software, you should know about things likelocalization, the Script Manager, Script Manager compatibility, andtranslation, to name a few.andP;  But there's more.andP;  What is Apple doing to helpdevelopers with their foreign-language packages?andP;  If you do have aforeign-language software package, how will it be distributed abroad?andO;LINGUAS EN LAS MAQUINAS?andM;The Mac is certainly not the first computer to embrace foreign- interfacesystems.andP;  In point of fact, development of foreign-language software has ahistory dating back prior to the Mac's beginnings.andP;  Since 1978, softwaredevelopers have been concentrating on bringing Japanese packages tocomputers.andP;  Reasons for this include the push within U.S.andP;  companies to enterthe Japanese market as well as the demand in Japan for software.andP;  Thechallenges presented by the alphabet also kept developers focused on Japan.andO;And they still are -- Apple is using Kanji as a test case for its non-Romanalphabet  System software.andM;The first language-system software was developed by Xerox PARC for itspersonal computer workstation, Star.andP;  Text was seen as a universal concept,encompassing any language no matter what the alphabet or character width.andO;Flexible encoding lets users work on Roman and  non- Roman alphabetlanguages.andP;  In this system, each character in a particular language wasrepresented as a sequence of bytes based on ASCII codes.andP;  From this base,binary code numbers were assigned to each of the world's alphabets, creatingshiftandM;alphabet signals.andP;   This concept of character representation wasandM;carried over to the Mac.andM;Since this method of handling different languages has existed for ten years,why is there such a fuss over the Mac's facility with foreign languages?andP;  Forone thing, thanks to foresight in the architecture of both Macintosh hardwareand software, the task of adapting to other languages is much easier on theMac than on other computers.andP;  Instead of having to tear up the actual code ofindividual programs, Macintosh programmers can take advantage of a modular,``blanket'' system for creating foreign versions of software.andP;  THE LOCALIZERandM;Localization is akin to reverse engineering -- you have all the menus, dialogboxes, and windows in English, and you must customize them for a specificlanguage, keeping in mind how the foreign user will understand the program.andO;For example, if you're shipping your product for use in France, all theaforementioned items, along with documentation and packaging, should be inmodern French.andM;Localization is not the same as translation.andP;  You can translate manuals andother such documents through interpreters, but interpreters aren'tnecessarily programmers.andP;  To localize the application, you must maintain theMac interface and the format of the program while incorporating the language.andM;Because localization is more technically involved, companies tend to keepthis process close to their offices in the United States (or near theirforeign subsidiaries, if they have any) while sending documentation abroadfor translation.andM;To localize software, you must consider how the intended user will view theapplication.andP;  Everything from the Get Info box to any on-line help you offerin a package should appear in the language of the intended user.andM;For the ad hoc user, there are ways to get around localization problems.andO;With software like Key Caps and various fonts, accents and other specializedforeign-language characters are readily available.andP;  But another problemarises when you want to create a document in a language such as Arabic,Russian, or Japanese.andP;  With only fonts and Key Caps available, creating adocument in these languages is a cut- and-paste process.andP;  Localized softwareis a sophisticated solution  to this problem.andP;  A MANAGER FOR ALL SCRIPTSandM;To the layman, a script manager may be someone who works on the set of amovie.andP;  Actually, the Script Manager is a standard part of System softwarefrom Apple.andP;  It is the low-level code that extends the text-manipulationcapabilities of the Mac beyond those needed for Roman scripts.andM;The Script Manager works within an application by calling on the ScriptInterface System.andP;  The Script Interface System provides the Script Managerwith fonts for a particular language; keyboard-mapping tables; specialroutines for character input, conversion, sorting, and text manipulation; anda desk accessory for system maintenance and control.andM;The Roman Interface System is always present in the System file on the Mac.andO;Other Systems can be purchased either directly from Apple or through theApple Programmers and Developers Association (APDA).andP;  Currently available areKanjiTalk (version 2.0 was available at  press time) for Japaneseapplications, the Arabic Interface System (2.0), the Hanzi (Chinese)Interface System (1.0), the Hebrew Interface System (2.0), and the KoreanInterface System (1.0).andP;  These systems work just like the standard Systemsoftware, but their menu bars, Apple menus, and dialog boxes appear in thealphabet of the specific language.andM;Though it's useful for European languages, the Script Manager is a necessitywhen working with languages that have non-Roman alphabets.andP;  Working inconcert with the Script Interface System, the Script Manager allows, forexample, an Arabic-speaking user to input text that will advance, wrap, andread from right to left.andP;  All non-Roman alphabets present problems inkerning, justifying, and delimiting.andM;In Kanji, the characters are 2 bytes wide -- Roman characters, along withmost others, are 1 byte wide.andP;  As long as an application is compatible withthe Script Manager, the byte size of characters makes no difference in termsof text entry.andM;As with Kanji and Hanzi, individual Arabic characters are modified accordingto surrounding letters.andP;  For example, when you place two letters together ina word, they form a new character that is different from the individualletters that made it.andP;  Another problem associated with this characteristicinvolves word boundaries.andP;  To take care of such difficulties, the ScriptManager will intercept  TextEdit calls.andP;  It then calls the interface systemroutines to perform functions like selection and word wrapping for a givenscript.andP;  This is also important for languages like Arabic and Hebrew thatread  from right to left -- the algorithms in the Script Manager tell the Macto enter text in the given direction.andP;  However, the Script Manager does notyet acknowledge this form of text entry for Chinese and  Japanese, which readvertically.andM;Overlooked features in this multilingual process include the way dates andtimes are displayed.andP;  For these, you need to use International Resourcesincluded in the International Utilities package.andP;  Because Script Managerallows for multiple formats, new international (INTL) script resources(ordinarily with ID numbers 0 and 1) are added.andP;  They are now identified asitl0, itl1, and so on.andP;  You can use these within a field for timeCycle ordateOrder to format time and dates for the specific country.andP;  IT'SCOMPATIBILITY THAT COUNTSandM;Whether you're creating your own application or using one of the commercialones available, it should be compatible with Script Manager.andP;  Script Manageris helpful in terms of hyphenation and keyboard layout, even for Europeanlanguages.andP;  This is not to say that the Script Manager has a hyphenationdictionary -- it doesn't.andP;  Just as the Script Manager manipulates text toallow for word-wrapping in such alphabets as Arabic and Japanese, itmanipulates text to allow for logical hyphenation in different languages,depending on the Script Interface System in use.andM;Not all commercial packages are compatible with the Script Manager, however.andO;PageMaker's European versions, for instance, are not.andP;  Hyphenation is takencare of within their internal systems.andP;  The same is true of Word -- Microsoftincorporates a hyphenation dictionary of its own.andP;  Other packages, likeQuarkXPress, base their hyphenation on Apple's foreign System software.andM;And speaking of Apple's foreign System software, can the average user get aScript Interface System from Apple?andP;  Well, it would probably be easier to goto the actual country for a specific language System.andP;  Apple has determinedfor now that they will not sell Script Interface Systems commercially in theU.S.andP;  You can, in certain instances, get one on special order, but it willsurely take a while to arrive.andM;So, do you really need the foreign System to run, say, the Spanish version ofWord?andP;  The answer depends on what you expect to accomplish with the package.andO;If you need it just for making address labels, creating restaurant menus, orother small word-processing jobs, no.andP;  But if you're planning a job of themagnitude of staging a  revolution in a country, say, and you need to writeup the new constitution and other charters, or if you have other largeword-processing projects, you'll probably want a language-specific version ofthe System software.andP;  You'll also want the keyboard specific to the language.andO;Apple offers all its Macintosh models in popular foreign configurations.andO;These come with custom keyboard layouts to handle a given language.andP;  MAC'SSCHIZOPHRENIAandM;With all the Script Interface Systems available, the Mac can take on a numberof personalities.andP;  Just as easily as toggling through desk accessories, theMac can process text in Kanji, Hangul (Korean), or Arabic.andP;  Some developershave realized the potential of combining several systems on one machine.andM;MultiTalk, a multilingual operating system for the Mac, is one suchby-product of Apple's Script Interface Systems.andP;  Devised by a company calledWrite Approach, MultiTalk is based on and incorporates Apple's operatingsystems.andM;Using Interface Systems for Hanzi, Hangul, Kanji, and Arabic along with fontssupported through the Roman System for Cyrillic (Russian) and Greek amongother alphabets, a user can take advantage of the Mac's capabilities,independent of language.andP;  MultiTalk can be customized to incorporate anylanguage desired.andP;  Under one localized system, you can add any other languagein which you want to work.andP;  APPLE'S HOUSE CLEANINGandM;Because foreign-language systems and script management are so closely tied tothe internal workings of the Mac and the System software, Apple really holdsthe keys for developers of foreign packages.andP;  Until recently, developers bigand small have had no clear path toward putting together their packages.andO;Getting the most current versions of KanjiTalk, HanziTalk, and HangulTalk hasbeen difficult.andP;  Why even APDA, Apple's designated distributor, has had thisproblem.andM;Thanks to a heated discussion regarding problems with availability of foreignSystem software at the Spring '88 Developers' Conference, Apple did somespring cleaning.andP;  Under its new organization, Apple will offer business andtechnical information and help a developer  to establish a chain of contactsin a given country through its Developers' Services department.andP;  The Systemsoftware, packaged as Tool Kits, will be distributed through APDA.andP;  GETTINGTHE PRODUCT OUTandM;Following Apple's lead into the international marketplace is a safe route totake -- Apple can offer support.andP;  You're on your own if you choose to blazenew trails.andP;  And you should be aware of obstacles you may face.andM;Because Apple and so many developers are already established in Europe,distribution there isn't much of a problem.andP;  However, if you're a smallcompany with no exclusive distribution channels and no foreign bases, youwill encounter some barriers to entry just because you're an outsider.andO;Aligning yourself with a major distributor is a great help in penetratingforeign markets.andP;  Even better, if your company has a lot of capital andpersonnel, you can set up your own foreign base.andM;Unlike Europe, Japan -- with its strict import regulations -- tends to makedistribution of a software package a nightmarish task.andP;  Again, it would bewise to develop a contact through Apple or through one  of the major softwaremanufacturers already established in the country.andP;  Otherwise, a softwarepackage will bounce from distribution channel to distribution channel, losingmoney along the way.andM;A common scenario: You sell your package to one distributor at one price.andO;The distributor turns around and sells it to another distributor at a higherprice.andP;  This distributor sells it again at a higher price.andP;  By the time yourpackage reaches the store, it has been through 10 or 15 channels.andP;  The priceis exorbitant and your profits are gone.andM;With the right contacts, however, you can avoid several of these channels andperhaps see your product actually sell.andP;  If it does, you'll also actually seea reasonable profit.andP;  IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEEandM;While its adventures abroad have brought the technology to more people, theMac still has a long way to go.andP;  With the difficulties users face inobtaining foreign-software packages and System software, Apple is missing outon potential users within the U.S.andP;  In the Hispanic community alone, demandis high for Spanish versions of software.andM;Other potential users are in the university community, where many languagepackages would be excellent learning tools and stepping stones forspecialized applications.andP;  Up to now, the Macintosh has offered us so much interms of engineering, graphics, and text handling.andP;  The Macintosh can nowteach us a little about language and a little about culture at the same time.andM;``Bienvenidos a Macintosh!'' KRISTI COALE, ASSISTANT EDITOR, WONDERS WHEN THEFIRST VERSIONS OF APPLE'S PIGLATINTALK AND RELATED APPLICATIONS WILL BEAVAILABLE.andP;  The Berne Conventionone of the factors affecting softwaredevelopers is international copyright laws.andP;  Included in the internationalpatent and trademark treaty is the Berne Convention, a ``moral rights''clause meant to protect intellectual creations.andP;  Nations signing theConvention have a ``moral obligation'' to observe Berne's copyright laws withrespect to works originating in other countries.andM;In terms of U.S.andP;  software, a company may send its package abroad forlocalization.andP;  The country in question cannot change the package in any way,save for localization.andP;  The software is still the property of the U.S.andO;author, not the localizer.andM;While its trading partners have signed, the U.S.andP;  has not, citing minorincompatibilities with its own Copyright Act.andP;  For the time being, U.S.andO;software products abroad are receiving the same treatment as Europeanproducts, despite the United States' failure to sign the pact.andP;  There maycome a time when European nations will tire of our receiving a free ride inthis respect, and they may cease to honor the Convention for an unsignedcountry.andP;  The Lingo of Learningamong the few language-software programsavailable is Conjugate!andP;  Spanish, a verb-conjugation tutorial from MacadamiaSoftware of Tennessee.andP;  This program is an effective  tutor.andP;  A user clickson the program icon and is given an exercise window.andP;  At the top is theinfinitive of a given verb.andP;  Another window indicates the tense and personthe drill wants.andP;  If you're wrong, you get one chance to redeem yourself;otherwise, the program tells you the right answer.andP;  As you run through a listof verbs determined by the program, Conjugate! redrills you on the ones youmissed.andM;Through the menu bar, you can choose the verb form (-ar, -er, and -ir ) andtense.andP;  This is good if you need to work on a specific tense of verbs.andP;  Ifyou want to test your vocabulary, you can choose to view the drills inSpanish.andP;  You can also select not to see the English translation of the verb.andM;Through Kinko's Academic Courseware Exchange, you can get another languageprogram called MacLang.andP;  The idea of this program is to let language teachersinexperienced in computers write ``computer- assisted language learning''exercises on the Mac.andM;Though MacLang is geared toward teachers, any individual user interested inlearning languages can use it too.andP;  You'll write all your own lessons.andP;  Itcomes with two disks, one for the ``Author'' of the lessons and the other forthe ``Students.'' You have your choice of writing lessons for French,Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Rumanian, Russian, or Greek.andP;  Exercisesare of three types: vocabulary, fill-in-the-blank, and paragraph.andP;  Forvocabulary, the student will be tested on word-equivalency translation,synonyms,  and matching words with a definition.andP;  The fill-in-the-blank andparagraph exercises test the student's ability to understand a language wellenough to guess words as a result of knowing the context.andM;For all exercises, the student can choose how many tries are allowed at eachdrill before the answer is given.andP;  When you end a session, the program letsyou know how you've done by tabulating the attempts and showing the number ofcorrect and incorrect answers.andP;  Teachers can also keep track of howindividual students progress.andM;Probably the best way to learn a language is to practice it orally.andO;Realizing the effectiveness of this method, Articulate Systems of Berkeleyhas produced Voice Navigator, a speech- recognition system that should be outby the time you read this.andM;Voice Navigator, working with a HyperCard stack, enables you to teach yourMac a list of foreign words, which it then uses to test your pronunciationand vocabulary.andP;  Drills come in three modes: learn, test, and practice.andP;  Theuser sees a Home Card with objects labeled in English.andM;For the purposes of testing Voice Navigator, Articulate Systems has chosenJapanese for its tutorials.andP;  In the test mode, different objects will behighlighted on the Home Card.andP;  At each object, the user will be expected togive the Japanese word.andP;  If your pronunciation or guess is wrong, a voicetells you and gives you another chance.andP;  If you don't know the word, you cansay it in English and the computer will give you the Japanese.andM;For more information on any of these language tutorials, contact thefollowing: Articulate Systems 2380 Ellsworth St. Berkeley, CA 94704 (415)549-1013 Kinko's Academic Courseware Exchange 4141 State St.andP;  Santa Barbara,CA 93110 (800) 235-6919, or in California, (800) 292-6640 Macadamia Software2503 Essex Place Nashville, TN 37212 (615) 383-2413.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
