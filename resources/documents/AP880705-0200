Meese, 56, made his surprise announcement at a news conferencein Sacramento, Calif., 3,000 miles away from his office and thecourthouse where Independent Counsel James McKay filed his 830-pagereport. The document was not made public, but McKay did not seekcharges against Meese for his ties with the scandal-tarred WedtechCorp. or any other activity, according to sources.   Each aspect of the investigation involved Meese's relationshipwith longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, who is under indictment foralleged racketeering in the Wedtech scandal.   Meese said he informed President Reagan of his decision bytelephone shortly before announcing it at the news conference. Hesaid he would return to private life either late this month or inAugust.   The president praised Meese, his confidant of two decades, as a``darned good attorney general'' and said he had no one in mind tosucceed him. ``That will all come later,'' said the president.   Meese's decision removes a stumbling block from Vice PresidentGeorge Bush's presidential campaign. The vice president is said tobe uncomfortable by the continuing controversy over the attorneygeneral's actions, but he has refrained from criticizing Meesepublicly.   Meese has been a favorite political punching bag of prospectiveDemocratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and other Democrats.   In a written statement, Bush said only: ``Ed did the right thingand I wish him well.''   Dukakis called Meese's resignation ``long overdue.''   ``I don't think he should have been appointed attorney generalin the first place and he should have stepped down long ago,'' hesaid. ``But this administration's inability to set high standardsfor public service will not be solved by the Meese resignation. Weneed a president who believes in public service who will set thosehigh standards and make our government something Americans can beproud of once again.''   Meese said he resisted calls for his resignation while McKay wasconducting his probe because he refused to ``allow myself to behounded out of office by false accusations.''   But now, he said, those allegations have been put to rest'' andthe time has come for him to return to private life.   Meese thus announced the end of a tenure as the nation's top lawenforcement official that was stormy even before he took office. Hesurvived an attempt by some Senate Democrats to block hisconfirmation in 1983, and was involved closely with the appointmentof two failed Supeme Court nominations.   Thoughout it all, though, Meese held the trust of the man whocounts most in the Reagan administration. The president turned toMeese to conduct an early investigation into the Iran-Contra affair_ a probe which reaped Meese more criticism from congressionalDemocrats _ and it was Meese who first announced to an unsuspectingworld that proceeds from the sale of arms to Iran had been divertedto the Contra rebels.   It was none of that which prompted the investigation by McKaywhich culminated in the report he filed with a special panel ofappellate judges in Washington. The report delved into Meese's tieswith the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., an Iraqi pipeline project,and two other enterprises.   In filing the report, McKay signaled that he did not havesufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against Meese. Butthe report could have become the basis for a separate,administrative review of Meese's fitness for office.   Meese told his California news conference he could not bringhimself to resign earlier, because ``to allow myself to be houndedout of office ... would undermine the system.''   ``We have been subjected to a barrage of misleading and falseallegations circulated through the media,'' Meese said.   McKay's report is expected to be issued publicly later in July,after Meese's lawyers have had an opportunity to prepare a responseto it.   McKay's office would say only that it anticipated the courtpanel would direct that a copy be sent to Meese's attorneys, NathanLewin and James Rocap.   In April, McKay said that if he decided that no prosecution waswarranted, he would ``refer all of those matters for review andaction by the appropriate administrative authorities.''   Before Meese's announcement, it was expected that any ethicalquestions raised by McKay's office would be referred to the JusticeDepartment's Office of Professional Responsibility, a unit whichexamines allegations of improper behavior inside the department.Such a review could result in a recommendation of dismissal byReagan.   At the Justice Department in Washington, spokesman PatrickKorten said he didn't think the prospect of an OPR examination ofMeese ``was a major factor in resigning.''   McKay's office, which launched its investigation of Meese on May11, 1987, had been:   _Examining Meese's assistance to Wedtech in 1981 and 1982, whenhe was White House counselor.   _Reviewing his actions in connection with a $1 billion proposedIraqi oil pipeline project after Meese became attorney general.   _Delving into the attorney general's meetings with regional BellTelephone company executives and his favorable recommendation onbehalf of the firms at a time when he held $14,000 in phoneindustry stock.   _Looking into members of a Washington real estate familyarranging to pay a $40,000-a-year salary for Meese's wife whileleasing office space to the Justice Department.   Meese's lawyers say their client received no financial benefitfrom any of the matters under investigation, that he violated noconflict-of-interest or other criminal laws and violated no federalethical guidelines.   At Wallach's behest, Meese ordered a White House review that ledultimately to Wedtech's $32 million, no-bid contract to build smallengines for the Army. Wallach was paid over $1 million by Wedtechfrom 1982 to 1986.   Wallach, interviewed late Tuesday on Cable News Network's ``LaryKing Live,'' said McKay's investigation had yielded ``not ascintilla of evidence of wrongdoing on Ed's part and, I submit,therefore, on my part.''   ``Ed Meese is the consummate lawyer in the best sense of theword,'' Wallach said. ``He is capable of detaching himself from hispersonal involvement to evaluate the facts which are presentedbefore him.''   Wallach in 1985 arranged for Meese to enter a financialpartnership with W. Franklyn Chinn, an investment manager whosubsequently became a member of Wedtech's board of directors. Chinnturned a $40,000 profit for Meese on a $50,000 investment in just18 months.   The pipeline portion of McKay's probe involved whether Meeseconspired with Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, Wallach and others toviolate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with analleged plan to pay bribes to the Israeli Labor Party, to protectthe proposed Iraqi pipeline from military attack. Meese received amemo from Wallach in September 1985 saying that up to $700 millionwould be paid to Israel from the pipeline project, and that ``whatwas also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, isthat a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor.'' Meesesays he doesn't recall reading that portion of the memo and hislawyers say that in any event, the words don't suggest that a bribewas contemplated.   In connection with the pipeline, Meese set up a meeting forWallach and his client, Rappaport, in June 1985 with then-WhiteHouse national security adviser Robert McFarlane.   The attorney general also sent a letter to then-Israeli PrimeMinister Shimon Peres in October 1985 recommending that Peresdiscuss the pipeline with McFarlane rather than the StateDepartment.   In connection with the telephone stock, Wallach urged Meese in amemo to get personally involved as attorney general in atelecommunications matter pending at the Justice Department. Afterobtaining a White House waiver allowing him to make a decisiondespite his stock holdings, Meese approved a reversal of thedepartment's position, and asked a federal judge overseeing thebreakup of ATandamp;T to lift most of the restrictions on the types ofbusiness that the regional Bell telephone companies could enter.   Prior to obtaining the White House waiver, Meese had met withexecutives of four of the regional Bell companies which wereseeking the reversal of department policy.</TEXT></DOC>
