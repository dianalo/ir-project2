It isn't possible to draw a neat line between the combatants and civilians because the entire population of the country is involved in the war effort. Afghan villages are shelled, refugee camps are bombed, children are maimed by Russian booby traps. All told, the Russians have killed one million people there -- most of them civilians.    The Defense Department's humanitarian assistance program provides invaluable support for the many volunteer groups sending desperately needed supplies to the Afghan refugee area in Pakistan. Commercial freight is slow and often unreliable, but the Defense Department gives fast and dependable service. It has shipped many truckloads of medical supplies and winter clothing for our group, and all of it arrived safely.    The final measure of the program should be the fact that many poor and overloaded hospitals are getting supplies, and thousands of refugees will be clothed well enough to survive another winter.    We who are involved in the effort to help the unfortunate people of Afghanistan are continually amazed that the Western world shows so little sympathy for a poor people who are fighting with their backs to the wall. Most of all, we find it hard to understand the mentality of those who show no desire to help the Afghans, but prefer to sit on the sidelines chattering about the dangers of &quot;using food as a weapon.&quot;    William Saunders   Treasurer   Free Afghanistan Alliance   Cambridge, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
