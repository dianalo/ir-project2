U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson, in a finding releasedThursday, said Samuel Rousso had violated the federal statuteprohibiting an Energy Department supervisor from participating indepartment decisions involving any energy company that thesupervisor has worked for within the past year.   Rousso is acting director of the department office administeringa program to evaluate Yucca Mountain, Nev., as a possible site forbuilding the nation's first permanent repository for high-levelradioactive waste from nuclear reactors.   Gibson's finding on Rousso was a central feature of a ruling hehanded down last week that blocked the Energy Department from givinga $1 billion Yucca Mountain management contract to a group led byBechtel Management Systems Inc., a subsidiary of the SanFrancisco-based engineering and construction giant.   Gibson agreed with a contention by TRW Inc., an unsuccessfulbidder, that Rousso should not have been involved in weighing theBechtel team's bid for the Yucca Mountain project.   The Cleveland-based company said Rousso had previously worked forone of Bechtel's partners, Science Applications International Corp.,a San Diego-based engineering and consulting firm that has played amajor role in the Yucca Mountain project as an Energy Departmentcontractor since 1983.   Rousso declined to comment on Gibson's finding.   ``I can't respond, since I'm a key party to the case,'' he saidin a brief telephone conversation.   The department issued a terse statement Thursday saying it wasreviewing Gibson's ruling and evaluating its ``legal and operationaloptions,'' and that in the meantime it would answer no questionsabout the matter.   Phil Keif, a department spokesman, said the department was notruling out the possibility of seeking civil penalties againstRousso, even though government lawyers had argued during thesix-week Claims Court hearing last spring that there was no conflictof interest.   The conflict-of-interest statute at issue in the case allows forcivil penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation, to be imposedby the department head or a federal court.   In an interview earlier this week with The Associated Press,Rousso said he had acted in good faith and believed no conflict ofinterest had been shown by lawyers for TRW, which had sueddepartment over Rousso's role.   ``I hold no pension rights, no favoritism, no job promises, nothoughts to that regard and I don't see where any conflict ofinterest has been shown,'' he said Monday.   The gist of the ruling was made public last Thursday, but Gibsonsealed the actual opinion to allow the companies involved to reviewthe document for any proprietary information or trade secrets thatshould not be publicly disclosed.   Gibson's ruling has broad implications for the Energy Department,which is struggling to revive a nuclear waste disposal program thathas been plagued for years with costly delays, scientificuncertainties and stiff opposition from the state of Nevada.   Rousso worked for Science Applications from October 1985 to May1986. He started working in the Energy Department's nuclear wastemanagement office in June 1986. He was chairman of a departmentpanel that studied the various Yucca Mountain contract bids andrecommended on Dec. 2, 1988, that the Bechtel team be chosen thewinner.   The Energy Department asserted in the Claims Court hearing thatthere was no conflict of interest because, among other things,Rousso was not aware during the restricted one-year period after heleft Science Applications that the company was interested in thecontract.   Gibson, however, said he found ``clear and convincing evidencethat Mr. Rousso actually knew (or at least should have known)'' ofScience Applications' involvement in the contract bidding process.   Gibson rebuked government lawyers for arguing that thedesirability of enforcing conflict-of-interest laws is not reasonenough to conclude that it would be in the public interest to blockthe department from awarding the contract to the Bechtel team.   ``This court will not sit idly by and blink at suchtransgressions on the part of government officials acting under themisguided assumption that such conduct does not harm the public'sfaith in the integrity of the procurement process,'' Gibson wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
