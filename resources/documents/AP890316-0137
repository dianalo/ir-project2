The two black activists are among several dozen detaineesrefusing to eat in protest of the 33-month-old state of emergencymeasures that allow police to hold people for an undetermined timewithout trial.   Sandile Thusi, 26, marked his 27th day without food Thursday andwas growing weak at a hospital in Durban, according to his lawyer,Dhaya Pillay.   Donsie Khumalo, a labor union official, was in ``extremelyserious'' condition at a Pretoria prison, according to his lawyer,Peter Harris. The attorney said Khumalo has been on hunger strikefor only seven days, but he was refusing water as well as food.   In Durban, about 3,500 students at the University of Natal held arally in support of the detainees.   ``A university cannot perform its proper role in society underthe institutionalized abuse of human rights,'' the vice chancellorof the university, P.D. Booysen, told the crowd.   Detainees in Johannesburg began the hunger strike Jan. 23 and asmany as 500 have participated for varying lengths of time sincethen. Most strikers resumed eating when Law and Order MinisterAdriaan Vlok promised Feb. 16 to release a substantial number ofdetainees.   Vlok said Wednesday he has authorized 400 releases, leaving about400 people in detention. Anti-apartheid groups have questioned thefigures and accused Vlok of reneging on his pledge.   Many of those released have been placed under tight restrictionsthat limit their movements and activities.   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detainedfor varying lengths of time since the government imposed theemergency regulations, which give security forces wide powers andban most forms of peaceful protest.   In another development, a political activist who has been inhiding for three years turned himself in to authorities Thursday.Police had sought Johnny Issel for alleged violations of thecountry's Internal Security Act, which covers a wide range ofactivities considered subversive.   Issel was released on bail pending a court hearing April 18.</TEXT></DOC>
