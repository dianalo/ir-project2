A three-judge panel of the court rejected arguments by the American Federation of Government Employees that urine tests taken without suspicion of illegal drug use would be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. &quot;We have found the privacy interests of employees . . . outweighed by the department's compelling interests in preventing drug use,&quot; the panel said in its ruling.    The union challenged the inclusion of department chauffeurs, Federal Aviation Administration aircraft mechanics, and Federal Railroad Administration hazardous-material inspectors in the testing program. When a federal judge dismissed the suit, the union appealed in 1987.    Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner called the appellate decision &quot;a great victory&quot; for the public, &quot;which expects and deserves a drug-free and safe transportation system.&quot; Union officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
