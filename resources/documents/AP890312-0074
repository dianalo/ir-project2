This kingdom has refused to suppport Iran's death order againstBritish novelist Salman Rushdie, and it is not expected to changeits position at the Organization of the Islamic Conference.   The Saudis also are expected to clash with Iran over the questionof recognition of the Afghan guerrilla government.   Arab diplomatic sources said Iran sent a delegation to Riyadh onSaturday for meetings to set the agenda for the four-day conferencebut that the delegation returned to Tehran without taking part inthe meetings.   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said an Iranian delegationheaded by the deputy chief of the Islamic Propagation Organization,Mohammad Ali Taskhiri, left Tehran Sunday to attend the conference.   Conference Secretary-General Hamed al-Ghabid confirmed theconference will take up the issue of Rushdie's controversial novel,``The Satanic Verses,'' which some say blasphemes Islam.   Saudi Arabia's 16 million people are mainly Sunni Moslems. Iran's50 million people overwhelmingly belong to the Shiite Moslem sect,long at odds with the Sunnis.   Most Sunnis agree with Iran that ``The Satanic Verses'' should bebanned. But they have stopped short of supporting Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini's call Feb. 14 for Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie, anIndian-born Moslem who lives in Britain.   Shiites comprise one-tenth of the world's 1 billion Moslems, andthe Iranians are clearly outnumbered in their bid to gain supportfor the death threat.   But Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidKhomeini apparently wants to press ahead in an effort to persuadeMoslems to view and support his campaign as a defense of Islamagainst the West.   Two Iranian government envoys have been touring Islamic statesseeking support for Iran's stance on the Rushdie affar. AhmadJannati was in Bahrain on Sunday, and Mohammad Yazdi was in Nigeria.   The Rushdie affair is discussed daily by the Iranian media. Saudinewspapers have made no mention of it.   Fourteen nations have withdrawn their top diplomats from Iran inprotest of Khomeini's death sentence.   The Saudis and Iranians have not had diplomatic relations sinceApril, when Saudi Arabia broke ties, citing terrorism and subversion.   One reason for the rupture was what the Saudis calledIranian-inspired riots during the 1987 annual Moslem pilgrimage toMecca. More than 400 people, most of them Iranians, were killed.   Khomeini has long challenged the Saudi royal family'sguardianship of Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.   On the Afghan issue, Saudi Arabia has been a key supporter ofSunni Afghan guerrillas who fought the Soviets until the Red Armywithdrew from Afghanistan last month after nine years ofintervention.   The Saudis have recognized the so-called interim Afghangovernment an alliance of Pakistan-based Sunni guerrillas formedlast month, and are pressing other Moslem nations to do so. Sudanfollowed suit on Saturday and several other Moslem states areexpected to act soon.   Iran, however, has backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas in the Afghancivil war. Those insurgents operate from Iran and are notrepresented in the interim government.   Pakistan, which has a large Shiite minority, sent its foreignminister, Sahabzadah Yacoub Khan, to Iran Saturday. Arab diplomaticsources said he was seeking to arrange a compromise between theguerrilla factions.</TEXT></DOC>
