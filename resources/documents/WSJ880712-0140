Last month Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel in the Iran-contra affair, charged that Joseph F. Fernandez, the former CIA operative, helped deliver arms to Nicaraguan rebels in defiance of a congressional ban and then lied to investigators in an attempt to cover up his activities.    Adm. Stansfield Turner, President Carter's CIA director, and some in Congress worry that indictment attempts to make Mr. Fernandez the fall guy for his superior's policies. &quot;The CIA people have got to learn a couple of lessons,&quot; Adm. Turner says. &quot;One is that the law is the law. Another is that if they want to be an elite organization, they have got to be more circumspect than other people. But certainly I don't think we should get the guys at the bottom if it's true that the guys at the top knew everything.&quot;    When Mr. Fernandez pleaded not guilty to the charges, his attorney, Thomas Wilson, warned that the indictment will have a &quot;chilling&quot; effect on the nation's intelligence operations. The indictment's message is that &quot;should you become enmeshed in activities which are perceived as involving policies where there may be an absence of political harmony at home, you may find yourselves upon your return to the United States the targets of criminal prosecution,&quot; Mr. Wilson complained.    Even Mr. Fernandez's supporters concede that he may have been overzealous in carrying out his mission; he was forced to retire from the CIA because he lied to the agency's inspector general.    But he later testified to the Iran-contra committees that his superiors, and Lewis Tambs, the former U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica, knew what he was doing. Mr. Tambs hasn't disputed the claim. Intelligence sources say two senior CIA officials were concerned by some of Mr. Fernandez's activities but didn't recall him from Costa Rica for five months in part because they believed he was doing the late CIA Director William Casey's bidding.    &quot;They knew what I was doing in terms of passing information back and forth between the {contra} commanders and the private benefactors,&quot; Mr. Fernandez told congressional investigators. &quot;. . . They allowed it to continue. So what am I as a reasonable person supposed to assume?&quot;    Mr. Fernandez testified that in April 1986, when he was visited by the new chief of the CIA's Latin American operations division, he told the official he &quot;felt a little uncomfortable&quot; passing intelligence to the contra arms network run by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Lt. Col. Oliver North, who at that time was a White House aide. Mr. Fernandez also testified that he showed his superior the classified KL-43 communications equipment he had received from Col. North to communicate with the secret contra-aid operation.    At a meeting a month later, Mr. Fernandez said, the division chief raised the problem with Alan Fiers, the chief of the CIA's Central American Task Force, but neither official ordered him to stop helping the secret operation. Mr. Fernandez testified that throughout the summer, he sent CIA headquarters detailed intelligence reports on arms deliveries to the Nicaraguan rebels, but &quot;nobody from Washington came down and said, 'Stop what you are doing.'&quot;    Intelligence sources say the Latin American division chief discussed Mr. Fernandez's activities with Clair George, the CIA's deputy director for operations, but the two did not act, in part because they believed the station chief's actions had Mr. Casey's blessing. Concern about Mr. Fernandez's actions on behalf of the contra-aid network continued to grow, however, and in September Mr. George and other top CIA officials finally recalled him to headquarters, ostensibly to serve on a promotion panel.    Now Mr. Fernandez has been forced to retire and is the only CIA official indicted by the special prosecutor. Mr. George retired without any disciplinary action, the Latin American division chief remains in his post, and Mr. Fiers received a reprimand from CIA Director William Webster. Mr. Casey died last year.    Lawyers familiar with Mr. Walsh's investigation say Mr. Fernandez was among their first targets because he played an important role in delivering arms to the contras, and because they were able to develop specific, untainted evidence against him. So far, these sources say, they don't have similar evidence against higher-ranking CIA officials -- primarily because some documents have been destroyed and a number of CIA officers haven't cooperated fully with the probe. </TEXT></DOC>
