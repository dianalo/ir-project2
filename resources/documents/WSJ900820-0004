Following localtradition, Mr. Gorbachev put his lips to the bowl as if tokiss the bread, and he took a taste. Not to be outdone, Mr.Kohl sprinkled some of the salt across the bread in the shapeof a crucifix. &quot;This is how we do it where I'm from,&quot; hesaid.   Increasingly, those affectionate July meetings look like asign of things to come. West German Foreign Minister HansDietrich Genscher and his Soviet counterpart, EduardShevardnadze, reached agreement in Moscow on Friday to allowthe four World War II Allied powers and the two Germanys tosign an agreement on Sept. 12 on German unification. It wastheir 11th meeting this year.   And the Soviet Union and West Germany were seekingadditional cooperation in Moscow last week. The Germanswanted to further accelerate the unification, and Moscow, inreturn, wanted a detailed bilateral agreement committing asingle Germany to economic, industrial, scientific andtechnological cooperation.   For his part, Mr. Genscher wanted the Soviet Union toagree to a suspension of allied rights over Germany as soonas the agreement was signed, rather than waiting for the fourcountries to ratify the agreement. Mr. Genscher's effortunderlined Bonn's continued concern that unification be madeirreversible as soon as possible.   West Germany and Moscow also have begun working out thecomplex details of sensitive agreements regarding thewithdrawal of 363,000 Soviet soldiers in East Germany. AndWest Germany has agreed to work out arrangements so that theSoviets don't suffer economically due to monetary union withEast Germany, which was Moscow's largest import source.   West Germany has already advanced the Soviets five billionmarks ($3.22 billion) in untied loans, it has given it 220million marks in food aid and agreed to pay 1.25 billionmarks toward the cost of stationing Soviet troops in EastGermany. What's more, Bonn's effort to increase its importsfrom Moscow have resulted in a 6% boost in foreign exchangeearnings for the Soviets in the first six months. Meanwhile,West German exports to the Soviet Union grew by less than 1%.   But the direct line to cash is only part of the story.Moscow increasingly regards Bonn as its lifeline to Westerneconomic assistance, international economic organizationsand, in short, to the modern world. It has been reassured ofMr. Kohl's good intentions by Bonn's willingness to act asits unofficial emissary to NATO and at the Houston economicsummit.   &quot;The Soviet Union sees a unified Germany as its centraltrading partner, as its bridge to Western economic andfinancial institutions,&quot; says Horst Teltschik, Mr. Kohl'snational security adviser. What's more, Soviet officials havetold their West German counterparts that they pray for theirsuccess in privatizing East Germany because it could serve asa model for their own efforts and as a weapon againstinternal political opponents.   Ironically, it is the same two superpowers that helpeddivide and then competed over the fate of divided Germanythat now are helping the country emerge united and robust soas to satisfy their individual interests. &quot;There will be anew sort of axis -- although that may sound like a bad word-- of the Germans, the Soviets and the U.S.,&quot; says KarstenVoigt, a Social Democratic member of West Germany'sparliament. &quot;The long fear that the Soviets could play aGerman card is gone. The card is lost when unification iscompleted. Now the Soviets want to use us as a card to growcloser to the West, to the U.S.&quot;   The source of the new amity is most likely Realpolitik.Chancellor Kohl's successful policy of remaining close toWashington and NATO accomplished two essential goals: Itpositions Germany as an attractive and essential partner forMoscow that can coax the rest of the West. And it frees Bonnfrom the accusation that its tie to the East is an ominouscontinuation of historical German policies that led to theHitler-Stalin agreement and set the stage for World War II.   Many Europeans are understandably fearful when Germany andRussia warm to each other. But experts believe there is farless cause for concern this time around. That's because therest of Europe was better prepared for Bonn's unilateralimprovement of its relations with Moscow. And Moscow is usingits link to Bonn to avoid being isolated from the otherWestern allies.   &quot;There's nothing detrimental to U.S. interests,&quot; saysRobert Hormats, a former American official now at GoldmanSachs in New York. &quot;It is uncomfortable for Washingtonbecause we are accustomed to being the primary interlocutorfor Moscow and Bonn both. . . . But the new order in Europeis that Germany is the new major economic and politicalplayer. Germany and Moscow are increasingly working outbilateral arrangements in their interests without consultingthe U.S.&quot;   &quot;Gorbachev is trying to influence the alliance throughKohl,&quot; adds Uwe Nehrlich, a security expert at the Institutefor Policy Studies near Munich. &quot;Kohl's power is derivative.If he had allowed his ties to the U.S. and the alliance toloosen, his leverage with Gorbachev would be less.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
