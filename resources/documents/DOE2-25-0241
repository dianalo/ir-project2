In this invention, the reformertemperature can well be controlled always by controlling the reformertemperature with a vent valve and an auxiliary burner valve and calculatingthe target value of the air flow for combustion through detecting thecontent of the exhaust gas from the fuel cell, thus the control performanceof the above system is improved in comparison with the existing methodwhich manipulates the auxiliary valve only. Besides, concerning the combustionin the reformer, incomplete combustion and temperature drops are eliminated.Thanks to the above, the reliability of the fuel cell power generationsystem can be improved.
