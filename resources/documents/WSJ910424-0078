French concerns spent a total of $12 billion to acquireU.S. companies last year, edging ahead of British companiesspending $11.3 billion and Japanese acquirers with $8.2billion, according to Securities Data Co. Those totals allremain far below the $25 billion a year spent by Britishcompanies in 1987 and 1989.</LP><TEXT>   The French have become all the more visible because U.S.merger activity this year has hit 10-year lows while theFrench are still bidding aggressively. &quot;The French have beenvery active,&quot; says Felix Rohatyn, a general partner at LazardFreres andamp; Co., an investment bank which represents severalFrench acquirers.   This year, Schneider S.A. has offered $1.96 billion in ahostile bid and proxy battle to acquire Square D Co., anelectrical equipment maker. Axa-Midi, a French insurerseeking a U.S. acquisition, is talking to Equitable LifeAssurance Society of the U.S. and other insurance companies,about an investment or possibly a controlling interest. And agroup led by Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank, is biddingfor the troubled Executive Life Insurance Co., with $10billion in assets.   &quot;French companies are paying high prices to acquire goodU.S. companies in key strategic industries,&quot; notes DeanKehler, a managing director of Argosy Group, a New Yorkinvestment banking boutique.   Mr. Rohatyn says French companies &quot;have strong ambitionsin terms of their global reach.&quot; French industrial policy, heexplains, &quot;has sort of created much more closely relatedstrategic groupings in France with long-term strategicobjectives,&quot; including U.S. acquisitions. &quot;I would think thatthis is not going to stop soon,&quot; he adds.   However, some other investment bankers say the Frenchbuying binge may soon fade, just as the British and Japanesehave pulled back in the past 18 months after a series ofsplashy U.S. takeovers that attracted political heat. Onereason is that several French concerns that made big U.S.purchases have since had heavy losses or sharply reducedearnings.   Just last week, Groupe Michelin announced a 1990 lossequivalent to $855.5 million, reflecting both slumping autosales and the burden of its $1.5 billion acquisition ofUniroyal-Goodrich Tire Co. last year. Two weeks ago, theFrench government said it would pump about $1.5 billion intoailing electronics concerns Thomson S.A. and Cie. desMachines Bull, which have both had losses after making bigU.S. acquisitions. Thomson acquired a consumer electronicsbusiness from General Electric Co. in 1987, and Bull boughtthe computer business of Honeywell Inc. in 1987 and that ofZenith Electronics Corp. in 1989.   &quot;I think there will be a marked slowdown&quot; in U.S.acquisitions by the French, says Remy Caillaux, an investmentbanker at Cie. Financiere de Paribas. &quot;After any period ofheavy acquisition, there has to be a period of digestion.&quot;   Adrian Haxby, a mergers expert in the Paris office ofLondon-based S.G. Warburg Group PLC, says some Frenchacquirers have been criticized for overpaying. Are they? Mr.Rohatyn says the answer may not be apparent for 10 years insome cases. But, he concedes, &quot;In order to make acquisitionsquickly and in a friendly way, they are prepared to pay apremium.&quot;   A year ago, Saint-Gobain S.A. blew away a $76-a-share bidfor Norton Co., a U.S. abrasives maker, by Britishconglomerate BTR PLC with a $90-a-share, $1.84 billionmerger. But in January, the French concern said 1990 profitfell 22%, due both to weakening auto and building materialsmarkets, and to higher interest costs on its debts, whichdoubled last year. Rhone-Poulenc S.A. also reported lower1990 profit after acquiring Rorer Group Inc., the U.S.pharmaceutical concern, for $3.48 billion in July. To besure, big acquisitions almost always hurt results of theacquirer during the initial digestion phase.   Piers von Simson, director in charge of internationalmergers at S.G. Warburg, says the French lagged behind theBritish and Japanese in U.S. acquisitions because of its pastlimits on foreign investment, and more recently because thegovernment was preoccupied with selling stakes in somestate-owned companies.   British acquirers have retreated from U.S. acquisitionsdue to a flagging British economy. The British stock market,which once favored such purchases, now penalizes companiesthat have made them. In Japan, acquirers have tried to keep alow profile to reduce the backlash against highprofiletakeovers of Rockefeller Center and Columbia and Universalmovie studios. Also, Japanese banks have pulled in theirhorns on loans of all kinds.   Credit Lyonnais is one of the most active participants inthe U.S. deal market at the moment. It has helped Leon Black,formerly head of mergers at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,assemble a pool of more than $1 billion to invest inhigh-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds of troubled companies.   Its securities arm is leading a group, also advised by Mr.Black, trying to acquire Executive Life in California.However, Credit Lyonnais's stake in the group is limited byU.S. laws preventing the bank from owning a U.S. insurancecompany.   And the big French bank has a huge loan estimated at $1.5billion out to Pathe Communications Co., which acquiredMGM/UA Communications Co. in November for $1.3 billion. Lastweek, the bank pressured Pathe Chairman Giancarlo Parretti toresign, and it has been negotiating with other creditors whohave sought to place troubled Pathe in involuntarybankruptcy.   A spokesman for Credit Lyonnais said officials of theFrench bank declined to discuss the issue of French takeoveractivity in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
