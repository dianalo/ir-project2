The anti-gas-tax amendment, approved by voice vote, expressedthe ``sense of the Senate'' that motor fuel taxes should remaindedicated to improvements in the highway and transportation system.   There is no specific call for such a tax in the trillion-dollarspending plan now before Congress. However, sources have said theadministration is considering proposing to combine a gas-taxincrease with a reduction in the capital gains tax on investmentsin the budget to be submitted next year.   While Senate leaders accepted the non-binding gas-tax amendmentwithout a quarrel, Majority Leader George Mitchell said otheramendments might be used to undermine the White House agreement. Inthose cases, the Maine Democrat said, ``a majority will prevail''and the plan will survive.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, continued his criticism of the budget plan today,although he now acknowledges he'll probably vote for it. The plancontains ``those kind of assumptions that result in a budget that Idon't think has much realism to it,'' he said on ``CBS ThisMorning.''   Debate on the $1.17 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990 beganTuesday night in the Senate and was starting today in the House.   The plan ``arrives here bloody, but I believe unbowed _ largelybecause it represents the very best compromise reachable,'' saidSen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committeethat helped draft the blueprint.   The agreement reached last month with the White House designedto reduce the deficit by about $28 billion, to below the $100billion limit of the Gramm-Rudman law.   Critics of the agreement, and the budgets it has produced,contend that the deficit reduction it claims is mostly illusory _since billions of dollars in alleged ``savings'' are really justaccounting changes. For example, nearly $1 billion in payments tofarmers would be made early so they occur before the start of thefiscal year.   In addition, the resulting deficit projection is based on WhiteHouse economic forecasts that have been widely criticized as toooptimistic.   But Sasser and others defending the plan said Congress shouldfocus on the positive.   ``It's a first manageable step toward the ultimate deficitreduction objective we all share,'' said Sasser, saying he hopedfor ``a strong vote for passage here on the Senate floor.''   President Bush at the White House on Tuesday told congressionalleaders he hoped the budgets would be approved and lawmakers shouldreject ``killer'' amendments. Several, including one to send thewhole deal back for further negotiations, were expected to beoffered.   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said after the WhiteHouse meeting that the budget was ``close to what theadministration had asked for.'' He and the Democratic leaders wereworking to make sure no amendments in their chamber would ``upsetthe whole apple cart.''   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Republican on the budgetpanel, said those critical of the progress made in reducing thedeficit ``just don't know the facts.'' He cited projections of afew years ago that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be$300 billion, nearly twice what is now expected.   ``What would a big deficit deal be?'' for next year, he asked.``Taxes,'' he said, something Bush has promised to veto and theDemocrats don't want to embrace without presidential leadership.   Actually, taxes are part of the current agreement. Both theHouse and Senate budgets include the $5.3 billion in unspecifiednew tax revenues that are in the White House agreement.   The president contends most of that would be new revenuegenerated by reducing the tax rate on capital gains, but Democratssay they won't go along with that plan and suggest that alternativelevies acceptable to president must be found.   The plans also include other new revenues, including $5.7billion from selling off government assets and about $2.7 billionin higher fees for government services.   As called for in the White House pact between the president andcongressional leaders, both the House and Senate budgets envision$299.2 billion in military spending next year, about the same asthe current year.   The Pentagon would be given total spending authority of $305.5billion, a figure which includes some outlays which stretch pastthe end of the fiscal year.   Foreign aid spending would be set at $17 billion.   Entitlement programs would grow so individual benefits andcost-of-living increases would escape cuts. However, a variety ofcost-cutting actions including some of those bookkeeping changeswould allow for $8.3 billion in total savings from Medicare,agriculture, federal pensions, and other entitlements.   In other domestic programs, the White House agreement set anoverall spending cap, but gave no specifics, and the House andSenate budget committees took somewhat different approaches. TheHouse favored education, health and veterans programs compared withmore Senate emphasis on agriculture, energy and law enforcement.   Once the House and Senate complete their budgets, the twochambers must agree on a single resolution. The document thenserves as the guide for the annual spending and tax legislationproduced by the Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
