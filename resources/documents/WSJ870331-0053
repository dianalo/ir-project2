The two funds, the New York City Teachers Retirement System and the Ministers and Missionaries Benefit Board of the American Baptist Churches, together own 184,000 of Royal Dutch's 268 million shares outstanding. They plan to enlist the aid of other institutional investors in voting enough shares to force a special shareholders meeting to consider Royal Dutch's involvement in South Africa.    Details of the campaign are to be announced today by New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin and Gordon Smith, treasurer of the Ministers and Missionaries Benefit Board. Smith said 10% of Royal Dutch Petroleum shareholder votes is needed to call a special meeting. He said Royal Dutch is being targeted because it is one of the largest firms operating in South Africa.    Royal Dutch's South African unit, Shell South Africa, is involved in oil refining and marketing, chemicals, coal and metals.    In Houston, a spokesman for the company's Shell Oil Inc. unit said Royal Dutch officials have long been on record as opposing apartheid. &quot;The wholesale withdrawal of foreign investment would stop the very pressure for change which multinationals have exerted. More than that, it could harm the people it is intending to help,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
