The major European central banks, the Bank of Canada and the U.S.Federal Reserve cut off a dollar rally early in the New York tradingday with three coordinated bouts of intervention, traders said.   As usual, the Bank of Japan stayed out of the action. Tradersbelieve the Japanese central bank is being reserved as the ultimateweapon in case massive central-bank action is needed to stabilizethe dollar.   Leonhard Gleske, a director of the West German Bundesbank, wasreported to have said he would prefer to see the dollar fall below1.8 marks. That statement was influential in driving the dollardown, said Alexis Egan, a trader at Banque Indosuez in New York.   The central banks' concerted action seems to have taken away someof the bullishness toward the dollar that prevailed for most ofJanuary, said James Pugh, vice president for foreign exchange atBear, Stearns andamp; Co.   ``Although I don't believe intervention works in the long run,they've got to the point where the dollar longs (those bullishtoward the dollar) are scared,'' Pugh said.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,the dollar rose 0.15 Japanese yen to a closing 128.20 yen. Later, inLondon, it was quoted at 127.80 yen. In New York the dollar fell to127.55 yen from 127.68 yen late Friday.   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost$1.7733 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7670 late Friday.But the pound edged lower later in New York to $1.7760 from $1.7765late Friday.
