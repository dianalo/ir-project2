McClean, 47, came up with the gimmick to raise $800,000 for theNational Children's Homes, an organization that cares for 11,000orphans in Britain.   ``I thought it'd be a good idea to have a message in a bottle,''said McClean, an orphan himself from age 2, just before pushing offat 12:46 p.m. from a West Side pier.   He expects to bob his way to Falmouth, England, in about 28 days.   The 37-foot steel bottle has a diesel engine with a top speed ofabout four knots, a little faster if the sail is up, McClean said.   An automatic pilot will steer the bottle, which was built by afriend. McClean will be traveling alone _ no mother boat _ but willbe in contact via radio with a team on shore and his family in FortWilliam, Scotland.   ``The most difficult thing is the first week, just getting usedto it, and especially if you have bad weather,'' he said.   Should he encounter any storms, ``then you throttle back andhave a sleep'' in the four-poster bed onboard, he said.   McLean also has navigation books and adventure stories to keephimself amused and small projects to work on.   The trip is sponsored by the British Ty-phoo Tea Co.   McClean set a world record for rowing across the Atlantic in 54}days in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
