Because the nation's highest court often waits until late in itsOctober-June term to issue decisions in the most closely watchedcases, anticipation gets the best of some.   This year's first rumor bubbled up late last week when pro-choiceand anti-abortion forces were convinced a decision in a key abortioncase would be announced Monday.   The court is being asked in a Missouri dispute to overturn orcurtail its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion.   No one could pinpoint the rumor's origin, but news reporters,lawyers and political activists helped spread it quickly throughoutthe capital city.   The television networks, with live-transmission equipment outsidethe court building and correspondents wired for sound, were poisedto break into their mid-morning programming Monday.   The decision was a no-show.   Such rumors about the timing of decisions, often assertedly basedon some unnamed knowledgeable source, have an amazing track record.They are never, ever correct.

Under former Chief Justice Warren E.

Answer: The late Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone testified beforethe House Judiciary Committee on June 24, 1943, about the highcourt's workload.</TEXT><NOTE>Rehnquist on Lawyers</NOTE><TEXT>   In a recent speech to the Australian Bar Association, the currentchief justice voiced concern about the number of lawyers surroundingsome legal disputes.   ``Obviously, if a client wishes this sort of massed battalions oflawyers on his side and is willing to pay for them, presumably noone else is the worse for it,'' Rehnquist said. ``But I have a sensethat often law firms impose this sort of a regimen upon a clientwithout it being requested.   ``There is no question in my mind that (these) developments ...have driven up the cost of legal services in the United States inthe past 35 years out of proportion to inflation,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>Could You Give Me That in Latin?</NOTE><TEXT>   News reporters who face tight deadlines on days the court issuesits decisions often _ but not always _ find help in shortersummaries prepared by a court officer called the reporter ofdecisions.   Here's an excerpt from one such synopsis accompanying aBankruptcy Code decision earlier this term:   ``The pre-Code practice of denying postpetition interest toholders of noncensensual lines, while allowing it to holders ofconsensual lines, was an exception to the exception for oversecuredclaims from the rule that the running of interest ceased when abankruptcy petition was filed, and was recognized by only a fewcourts and often depended on particular circumstances.''</TEXT></DOC>
