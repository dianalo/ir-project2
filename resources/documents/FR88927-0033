L. 95-561, the ``Education Amendments of 1978'' (25 U.S.C. 2011),as amended by Pub. L. 98-511 and Pub. L. 99-89. This notice is publishedin exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior tothe Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs by 209 DM 8. The Office of the Solicitorhas inserted the statutory additions required by Pub. L. 100-297. Theseconsist of (1) inserting a new sub-paragraph (4) to the definition of educationposition in andSection; 38.3 to comply with section 5112(b)(1)(b)(iv); (2)inserting ``or Federal Wage System'' into andSection; 38.6 (a) and (b) and``or subchapter IV of Chapter 53'' into 38.6(b) to comply with section5114(a)(1); and (3) inserting ``applicant or'' into andSection; 38.7(j) tocomply with section 5112(a).  On September 2, 1987, the Bureau of Indian Affairs published a proposedrule on Education Personnel in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 33382), which established requirementsfor voluntary services, employment, discharge, and payment of teachersand other personnel in Bureau of Indian Affairs operated schools and agencyeducation positions.  The public was invited to offer comments on the proposed rule on or beforeOctober 2, 1987. Nineteen commenters responded. All comments were considered.From the nineteen commenters, there were 58 comments on specific sections,and 11 comments addressing the general concerns of education. Each commentwas considered by the Office of Indian Education Programs, which accepted,rejected, or adopted a modified version of each comment. Some of the Union comments were not addressed since the Bureau of IndianAffairs negotiated those concerns with the union.  The Bureau's responses to the comments received have been organized intoa general category and by specific subparts. The general comments are categorizedwith responses, then each specific comment is addressed in the sectionof the proposed rule to which it relates. Some accepted responses necessitatedremoving sections or sentences of the rule and adding new sections or sentences.In one instance, the change required redesignating a section. For purposesof consistency, all section numbers appearing in this part of the Preamblerefer to the proposed rule as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 2, 1987. Each comment is followedby the Bureau's response. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments </ITAG>Eleven comments addressed under this section are those concerned with thegeneral areas of Bureau personnel operations rather than specific sectionsin the proposed rule. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed satisfaction with the proratedpay over a 12 month period. The same commenter expressed dissatisfactionwith the payroll system and its ability to pay employees correctly andon time. The system's inability to make correct deductions (bonds, rent,etc.), high teacher turnover, methods of instruction, and staff needs werealso points of dissatisfaction. <T3>Response: </T3>Since the comments are not relative to the proposedrule, we will not respond. However, the dissatisfaction and complaintswill be forwarded to the appropriate officers.  <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that we consider merit raisesfor those who improve their education and/or performance after they reachthe $24,000 level. <T3>Response: </T3>We believe that andSection; 38.6(c), Adjusting employeebasic compensation rates, addresses the commenter's suggestion. This subsectionprovides for additional raises based on contract renewal, performance,and education. <T3>Comment: </T3>Five commenters requested that the Bureau reassess itsteacher salaries and increase salaries to make them competitive with surroundingstates and/or school districts. Another commenter suggested that pay shouldbe averaged within each individual state and not with all other states.Another commenter said that employees should be compensated for workingin geographically isolated areas based on miles traveled and that workhours should be comparable to the local schools. <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau agrees that a reassessment of teacher salariesis needed. However, the original legislation requires that the salariesbe comparable to the general salary schedule. Pub. L. 100-297 providesfor one of two options for teachers and counselors, to become effectivein FY 1991. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that Agency Superintendents forEducation (ASE's) should be required to meet state administrative requirements.<T3>Response: </T3>The position of ASE's is exempted by statute. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter said that the 30-day comment period wasinsufficient for him to make any comments. <T3>Response: </T3>The proposed rule was published on September 2, 1987,and copies were distributed to the Area and Agencies by September 4, 1987.Copies should have been made available to all school staff by September15, which would have allowed two weeks of comment time. The following section responds to specific comments received from the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Definitions andSection; 38.3. </T3>One commenter recommended that weexpand and clarify the term ``Area Education Programs Administrator''.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree. The definition has been rewritten to clarify``Area Education Programs Administrator''. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Definitions andSection; 38.3 Education Position. </T3>In one commenter'sopinion, the term ``Education position'' should also apply to businesstechnicians, secretarial-type positions, and registrars. <T3>Response: </T3>The positions of business technicians, secretarial-typepositions, and registrars are included in the term ``Educational position''.<T3>Add: </T3>The term ``probationary period'' was added under the Definitionssection for clarity. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Definitions andSection; 38.3. </T3>Two commenters recommended that ``schoolterm'' be defined. <T3>Response: </T3>We agree, and ``school term'' was added to the Definitionssection. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Identification of Qualified Individuals andSection; 38.5(c). </T3>Onecommenter proposed that a pre-employment screening procedure be added thatwould incorporate a temporary contract not to exceed 120 days; that theapplicant should be found suitable for employment within this period oftime; and, if documented cause is shown that the applicant is unsuitable,that the contract may be terminated without appeal or grievance rightsto the employee. <T3>Response: </T3>The proposal was not accepted. The additional proceduredoes not improve the current screening procedure. The proposal would doublethe current paper workload and could delay the payment of salaries andthe filling of positions. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Identification of Qualified Individuals andSection; 38.5(c). </T3>Onecommenter requested that we include a provision whereby an applicant whodoes not accept a position when offered by location indicated on the SF-171will be deleted from the applicant supply file. <T3>Response: </T3>The request was not accepted since this is a procedureand not a regulation. Also, this process is established in the Bureau ofIndian Affairs' Manual (BIAM) at 62 BIAM 11.2, Appendix A. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Adjusting Employee Basic Compensation Rate andSection; 38.6(c)(i). </T3>Onecommenter suggested that the contract renewal incentives be tied to theposition rather than the individual. <T3>Response: </T3>We believe that the contract renewal incentives mustbe tied to both the position and individual. This is addressed in the regulationsand no changes will be made in the regulations. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Special Additions to Basic Compensation andSection; 38.6(d)(1). </T3>Onecommenter said the 25 per centum staffing differential was inadequate whenrecruiting some specialized positions relating to special education. <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau agrees that the staffing differential maybe inadequate. However, current statute requires that the staffing differentialbe tied to the general salary schedule. No change was made.<T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Prorating of Pay andSection; 38.6(e)(3). </T3>One commenter suggesteda longer notification time for employees who wish to change their electionof a particular payment plan. <T3>Response: </T3>We have considered the recommendation for a longer notificationtime but feel that 30 days is an adequate time. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Payment of Compensation to Educators andSection; 38.6(e)(4). </T3>Onecommenter stated that it is unlikely that very many employees will electa stipend in lieu of overtime or compensatory time because they can earnmore through overtime pay. Therefore, any stipend established must be attractiveenough to replace the overtime option. <T3>Response: </T3>The option is provided by statute. However, we believethat when the stipends are established in 62 BIAM, the stipends and overtimepay will be comparable. No change was made. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Stipends for Extracurricular Activities andSection; 38.6(e)(4). </T3>Twocommenters remarked that stipends should equal those established locallyand would require local input and considerations before they are set. Anothercommenter suggested that the final stipend payment be withheld until coacheshave checked in all uniforms, equipment, and supplies. The commenter alsosuggested that stipends should not be in lieu of overtime or compensatorytime but should be the only compensation offered. <T3>Response: </T3>Subsection 38.6(e)(4)(i) provides for local input withcomparable rates to other school districts in or near the area. As forthe second comment, we do not believe that withholding of final stipendpayments for coaches, and not including other professional fields, wouldbe appropriate. Therefore the suggestion was not accepted. Pub. L. 98-511section 1142(a) requires that ``the Secretary shall provide a stipend inlieu of overtime premium pay or compensatory time off.'' No changes weremade. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Stipends for Extracurricular Activities andSection; 38.6(e)(4). </T3>Onecommenter asked, ``Once an employee elects to be paid a stipend for extracurricularactivities, can that employee turn around and demand overtime/compensatorytime instead? Why would an employee elect to be paid a stipend if he/shecan also demand hour-for-hour overtime/compensatory time? Some restrictionsshould be made.'' <T3>Response: </T3>The employee may elect to be paid a stipend or overtime/compensatorytime, but not both. Why an employee would elect one type of payment overanother would be subject to individual preference. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Appointment of Educators andSection; 38.7. </T3>One commenter said thatno reference is made to post audit responsibilities of the local Area PersonnelOffice. Without this procedure, strict adherence to established personnelpolicies, rules, regulations and procedures, which not only includes thePub. L. 95-561 contract system but also the Office of Personnel Managementregulations, could be seriously jeopardized or compromised. <T3>Response: </T3>The reference to post audit responsibilities of thelocal Area Personnel Office is addressed in the Bureau education personnelmanual. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Appointment of Educators andSection; 38.7. </T3>One commenter suggestedthat we add a subpart called ``Temporary Contracts'' that would offer atemporary contract for a period not to exceed one year that may be extendedfor up to one additional year with school board approval. <T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion was accepted and a new part has beenwritten retitled ``Temporary Contracts''. Subsections (i) Waiver of Indianpreference, (j) Prohibited reappointments, and (k) Contract renewals havebeen redesignated as sections (j), (k), and (l) respectively. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Local School Employees andSection; 38.7(a)(b)(c). </T3>One commenterrecommended that the school board should be required to state its reasonsfor disapproving an appointment at the same time they take the action.<T3>Response: </T3>As in the current regulation, school boards are governedunder such uniform procedures as they may adopt. There was no change withthe proposed rule and the recommendation was not accepted. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Appointment of Educators andSection; 38.7(b)(c). </T3>One commenter requestedthat provisions (b) and (c) should require the Director to respond withinthe same timeframe (10 days) as required by the Agency Superintendent forEducation and Area Education Programs Administrators under the provisionsin subpart (a). <T3>Response: </T3>The reason that the Director's office response timeis longer is due to the time it takes for the mail to reach the Director'soffice. The ten-day response time is not reasonable. The request was notaccepted. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Employment Contracts andSection; 38.7(d). </T3>Two commenters recommendedthat an additional clause be written into employment contracts wherebya person would be penalized a specified dollar amount for breaking a contractand a specified higher amount if a contract were broken at a late date.<T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau does not have the authority or legislationto penalize a person a dollar amount for breaking a contract. No changewas made. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Employment Contracts andSection; 38.7(d). </T3>One commenter suggestedthat the teaching staff should be given tenure rather than the year-to-yearcontract as provided in the rule. <T3>Response: </T3>The statute requires year-to-year contracts; therefore,no change was made. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Provisional Contracts andSection; 38.7(f). </T3>One commenter requestedthat quarter hours be included in the definition of satisfactory progress,that less than eight semester/quarter hours annually could be satisfactoryprogress if the employee can demonstrate that less hours are needed. <T3>Response: </T3>Since these comments are not directed at the rule, butrather the educational personnel manual, the comments will be consideredwhen the manual is rewritten. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Provisional Contracts andSection; 38.7(f)(4). </T3>One commenter suggestedthat the word ``satisfactory'' be defined under this subsection. <T3>Response: </T3>The word ``satisfactory'' will not be defined in theregulation. No change was made. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Provisional Contracts andSection; 38.7(f)(5). </T3>One commenter askedwho determines when an employee fails to meet the requirement for makingsatisfactory progress toward meeting full qualification requirements. <T3>Response: </T3>The supervisor will determine when an employee is makingsatisfactory progress. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Conditional Appointment andSection; 38.7(g). </T3>One commenter recommendeddeleting the section on conditional appointments since they have not experiencedthis situation in the last seven years during which 62 BIAM 11 has beenin effect. <T3>Response: </T3>Conditional appointments are required by Pub. L. 95-561.The recommendation was not accepted. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Short-Term Contracts andSection; 38.7(h). </T3>One commenter expressedthe need for a short-term flexible contract that would accommodate employeesthat work irregular hours with flexible schedules. <T3>Response: </T3>Short-term flexible contracts are already currentlybeing utilized as intermittent contracts under 62 BIAM 11.4.2D. Such contractsprovide for situations where work occurs on an irregular basis. These contractsmay be of year-long or school-year duration. Any intermittent work scheduleconnotes a ``substitute'' situation. <T3>Clarification: </T3>Clarifying language was added in andSection; 38.7(h)(2)(ii)that reads: ``* * * if the qualifications of the individual are lower thanrequired, * * *'' <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Waiver of Indian Preference andSection; 38.7(j). </T3>One commenter questionedthe waiver provision under this part as referring only to ``an employee''and not to a ``Federal employee''. <T3>Response: </T3>By implication we read the statute to mean any Federalemployee. The waiver provision applying to all Federal employees wouldprovide school boards a wider selection of experience and expertise. Nochange was made. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Contract Renewals andSection; 38.7(k). </T3>One commenter asked, underthis part, ``As stated, this means that if a school supervisor recommendsnonrenewal and the school board determines that the contract shall be renewed,the school board's determination will prevail without opportunity for reconsideration.Is that the intent of the authors?'' <T3>Response: </T3>No. An appeal procedure has been added to allow reviewof a school board's determination to renew a contract not recommended forrenewal by the school supervisor or an ASE or AEPA. <T3>Clarification: </T3>Clarifying language was added to the first sentencein andSection; 38.7(1)(2) to be consistent with subsection (a) of this section.<T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Nonrenewal of Contract andSection; 38.8(a). </T3>One commenter askedif an employee is given a written notice for nonrenewal, does this meanthat nonrenewal must be for cause and/or reason? <T3>Response: </T3>Yes. The cause or reason for nonrenewal must be specified,except during probation. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Nonrenewal of Contract andSection; 38.8(b). </T3>One commenter asked,``How and by whom is this appropriate official or body to be selected orappointed? Is such appointment limited to Federal employees?'' <T3>Response: </T3>The term ``appropriate official'' in andSection; 38.8(b)means a Bureau employee. The term ``body'' means the appropriate tribalentity. The school board is usually elected or appointed by the tribe(s)under such uniform procedures as they may adopt. Appointment to schoolboards excludes Federal employees, so Federal employees cannot be appointed.<T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Nonrenewal of Contract andSection; 38.8(g). </T3>One commenter suggestedthat we should place subsection (g) before subsection (a) since subsection(g) identifies what employees are eligible for in the procedures of sections(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f). The same commenter also questioned themeaning of the phrase ``* * * 36 months of continuous service * * *'' <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau agreed with the commenter, and subsection(g) was rewritten and moved to the introductory part of this section. The``36 months'' was changed to read: ``* * * three full continuous schoolterms * * *'' <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>Nonrenewal of Contract andSection; 38.8(g). </T3>One commenter askedif the 36 month time requirement included consecutive service or actualcontract time worked? <T3>Response: </T3>The term ``36 months'' has been changed to ``three fullcontinuous school terms'', therefore meaning three full consecutive contractterms. <T3>Clarification: </T3>Clarifying language was added in the first sentencein andSection; 38.8(g) after contract appointment that reads: ``* * * contractappointments, or serving a probationary period.''<T3>Deleted: </T3>The last sentence in andSection; 38.8(k) was deleted asbeing superfluous.<T3>Comment: Discharge of Educators andSection; 38.9. </T3>One commentersuggested that we simplify the appeal process for the employee.<T3>Response: </T3>We believe that the proposed rule cannot be furthersimplified without harming the due process of the employee. The suggestionwas not accepted.<T3>Comment: Discharge for Inadequate Performance andSection; 38.9(b). </T3>Onecommenter suggested that we include a definition of ``lack of student achievement''.<T3>Response: </T3>We believe that the definition for ``lack of studentachievement'' must be determined locally based on the local school program.A national definition could not be applied across all school programs effectively,therefore, the suggestion was not accepted.<T3>Comment: Discharge of Educators andSection; 38.9(b). </T3>One commenterrecommended that all Office of Indian Education Programs staff in the CentralOffice also be required to meet the provisions of this part regarding studentachievement.<T3>Response: </T3>Central Office employees are not educators as definedunder the statute.<T3>Comment: Conditions of Employment of Educators andSection; 38.10. </T3>Onecommenter said no references are made to labor-management relations responsibilitiesand requirements and suggested reference to the Bureau Labor ManagementRelations responsibilities be included to emphasize to tribal governmentsand school boards that the Bureau does have a responsibility to bargainingunit employees that assures them the right to representation, even withreservation schools. <T3>Response: </T3>No reference is made to labor relations responsibilitiesunder this part. When this Part and a negotiated labor relations agreementconflict, the negotiated agreement governs.<T3>Clarification: </T3>The first sentence in andSection; 38.10(c) was rewrittento clarify the administrative process contained in andSection; 38.8 of thispart.<T3>Comment: Conditions of Employment of Educators andSection; 38.10(c).</T3>One commenter suggested that an explanation should follow as to howthe contract is to be terminated.<T3>Response: </T3>The contract will be cancelled since it was never consummated.<T3>Comment: Conditions of Employment of Educators andSection; 38.10(e).</T3>One commenter thought the Bureau's policy of equal treatment of allemployees and applicants was contrary to actual practice.<T3>Response: </T3>There have been several laws governing Indian preferencefor employment in the Bureau. The first was in 1834 and last general provisionwas the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. 479). Congress extendedpreference in employment in the Bureau to qualified Indians and furtherdetermined that proper fulfillment of its trust required turning over tothe Indians a greater control of their own destinies.A Supreme Court decision of 1974 (<T3>Morton </T3>vs. <T3>Mancari</T3>) stated: ``this preference does not constitute `racialdiscrimination.' Indeed, it is not even a `racial' preference. Rather itis an employment criterion reasonably designed to further the cause ofIndian self-government and to make the BIA more responsive to the needsof its constituent groups.'' The decision further stated that ``The preference,as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial group, but,rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activitiesare governed by the BIA in a unique fashion.'' The Bureau is, therefore,required by law to give preference to qualified Indians in filling positionsas required in 25 CFR Part 5 (25 U.S.C. 472 and 479). <T3>Comment: Grievance Procedures andSection; 38.10(f). </T3>One commenterrecommended that, in locations and for positions covered by an exclusivebargaining unit, the negotiated grievance procedure would be an exclusiveavenue of redress for all matters within the scope of the collective bargainingagreement.<T3>Response: </T3>We disagree. Collective bargaining is covered undera different statute and is not appropriate to be referenced under thispart.<T3>Comment: Length of the Regular School Term andSection; 38.11. </T3>Onecommenter recommended that this section be omitted from this part. Thecommenter believes that the existence of a cooperative agreement does notautomatically waive the 180 days, and Bureau schools must still seek awaiver under andSection; 36.61. <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau partially agreed with the commenter. Thepart regarding cooperative agreements was deleted, and a provision forwaiver in 25 CFR 36.61 was added.<T3>Comment: Personal Leave andSection; 38.12(a)(1). </T3>One commenter askedif the proposed rule supersedes the National Council of Bureau of IndianAffairs Educators and National Federation of Federal Employees negotiatedagreements that specify hours of personal leave and emergency leave. Anotherquestion was whether the supervisor or the principal has the authorityto grant emergency leave.<T3>Response: </T3>The answer to the first question is no, the proposedrule does not supersede the union agreements. The answer to the secondquestion is yes. The supervisor or principal has the authority to approveemergency leave.<T3>Comment: Personal Leave andSection; 38.12(a)(1)(ii). </T3>One commenterrecommended that personal and emergency leave should be converted to sickleave at the end of the contract period.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not agree with the recommendation, since thiswould exceed the rate of four hours for each biweekly pay period whichis beyond what Congress has authorized.<T3>Comment: Sick Leave andSection;andSection; 38.12 (a)(2) and (d)(4). </T3>Onecommenter suggested that we include medical and dental appointments undersick leave coverage under these parts. <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau accepted the suggestion and medical and dentalappointment are include under ``Sick Leave'' in andSection;andSection; 38.12(a)(2) and (d)(4).<T3>Comment: Sick Leave andSection; 38.12(a)(2). </T3>One commenter recommendedthat sick leave be given at the beginning of the school year.  <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau disagrees with the recommendation. We believethat sick leave should be earned and, since sick leave can be accumulatedindefinitely, the recommendation was not accepted.  <T3>Clarification: School Vacation Time andSection; 38.12(a)(3). </T3>Thetitle of this part was shortened to read ``School vacation'' and the word``time'' was deleted. The second and third sentences were deleted and werereplaced with the following sentences: ``School vacations are scheduledon the annual school calendar during the instructional year and may notbe scheduled before the first day of student instruction or after the lastday of student instruction. School vacations are not a right of the employeeand cannot be paid. * * *''  <T3>Comment: Vacation Leave andSection; 38.12(b)(1). </T3>One commenter recommendedthat the 200 hours of leave for full-time year-long contract employeesbe comparable to the 208 hours of leave for General Schedule positions. <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau disagrees with the recommendation. The 200hours of vacation leave for year-long contract employees is earned aftersix or more years of service compared to 208 hours of annual leave forstatus quo employees with more than 15 years of service. We believe thatthe 200 hours of vacation leave for year-long contract employees is morethan appropriate. No change was made.  <T3>Comment: Vacation Leave andSection; 38.12(b)(1). </T3>Two commentersrecommended that ``rather than unused leave being forfeited at separation,we would like to see employees paid hour for hour or lump sum if the leavehas been prescheduled and cancelled due to an `exigency of the public business'''.  <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau disagrees with the recommendation. Provisionshave been added for carryover of leave. If lump sum payments were madeupon separation, this would place an undue burden on the school budget.No changes were made.  <T3>Change: </T3>Vacation leave hours in andSection; 38.12(c)(1) have beenchanged from 60 hours to 64 hours and from 100 hours to 104 hours due tocollective bargaining with the union. In andSection; 38.12(d) the 18 hoursof personal leave was changed to 20 hours and the word ``emergency'' wasinserted between the words ``personal leave'', again due to collectivebargaining.  <T3>Comment: Leave System for Education Personnel andSection; 38.12(f). </T3>Onecommenter asked why educators serving with contracts with work weeks of20 hours a week or less are not eligible for prorated pay.  <T3>Response: </T3>We do not believe that educators would want a smallerpaycheck spread over a year when they work less than 20 hours a week. Nochange was made.  <T3>Comment: Status Quo Employees in Education Positions andSection; 38.13(c)(1).</T3>One commenter recommended that ``failure of the school board to actwithin this period of time shall have the effect of approving the conversionof status quo employees to contract positions'' be added to the section. <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau disagrees with the recommendation since,by statute only the school board may approve an employee's conversion toa contract position. Therefore, positive action by the school board isrequired.  <T3>Add: </T3>A new subsection (b) was added for informational purposeto inform employees of the loss of the early-out retirement eligibilityunder Pub. L. 96-135. Section (b) was redesignated as subsection (c) inthe final revision.  <T3>Comment: Voluntary Services andSection; 38.14(a). </T3>One commenterrequested clarification of the term ``earning credit'' as a requirementfor performing voluntary services. As proposed, the rule indicated thatvolunteer services are limited to ``* * * individuals, groups, and studentsearning credit * * *''  <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau accepted the request, and the phrase ``** * earning credit (i.e., student teaching).'' was deleted. This sentenceeliminates the limitation for volunteers that they must be earning creditswhile performing the volunteer services.  <T3>Comment: Voluntary Services andSection; 38.14(b). </T3>One commenterrecommended that the term ``representative of the school'' be changed to``a representative of the college or university''.  <T3>Response: </T3>The Bureau agreed with the recommendation. However,the term ``institution'' was used in place of the word ``school''.  <T3>Comment: Voluntary Services. </T3>One comment was ``that our schoolshave been cooperating with colleges/universities for a long time in havingstudent teachers, so why should this now need to be covered by regulations?'' <T3>Response: </T3>Pub. L. 98-511 expands the authority of the Bureau toaccept voluntary services in other than student teaching.  The Department of the Interior has determined that this rulemaking doesnot constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the qualityof the human environment and that no detailed statement pursuant to section102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required.  The information collection requirement contained in andSection; 38.5 usesStandard Form 171 for collection that has been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and assigned clearance under 3206-0012.
