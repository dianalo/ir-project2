Background</ITAG>When the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Circular A-125, ``PromptPayment,'' the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provided implementinginstructions through its procurement regulations.Federal Acquisition Circular 84-33 was published on February 8, 1988, amendingthe FAR by adding Subpart 32.9 and a contract clause to implement OMB CircularA-125. The new FAR coverage supersedes most of the coverage on prompt paymentcurrently contained in the EPAAR.This rule deletes from the EPAAR regulatory material and contract clausessuperseded by FAC 84-33. The rule retains only unique EPA invoice submissionrequirements. These requirements have been incorporated in a new EPAARsubpart for consistency with the FAR structure.On October 17, 1988, the President signed Public Law 100-496, amendingthe Prompt Payment Act. This rule does not implement any provisions ofthat law.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>OMB Bulletin No. 85-7, dated December 14, 1984, establishes the requirementsfor Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review of agency procurementregulations. This regulation does not fall within any of the categoriescited in this Bulletin requiring OMB review.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this rule does not proposeany information collection requirements, which would require the approvalof OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The EPA certifies this rule does not exert a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The rule essentially deletesexisting material from the EPAAR that is duplicative of FAR coverage onthe Prompt Payment Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Public Comments.</ITAG>The EPA has not solicited public comments on this final rule since it doesnot have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors orofferors. The rule essentially deletes existing material from the EPAARthat is duplicative of FAR coverage on the Prompt Payment Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1532 and 1552</ITAG>Government procurement, Contract financing, Solicitation provisions, Contractclauses.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Chapter 15 of Title 48 Code ofFederal Regulations is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1532_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
