Soon that novelist, too, faced the same choice.    Former Democratic Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado is seldom compared with Benjamin Disraeli, and &quot;The Strategies of Zeus&quot; (Morrow, 359 pages, $18.95) is unlikely to be compared with the fiction that Disraeli wrote, but the two men share the tugs from both worlds. Disraeli went on to become prime minister, launch the modern period of imperialism and help fashion the Tory creed into a popular movement. And Mr. Hart, who has just polished off his second spy novel (the first was a joint effort with Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine) is poised for a second run for the presidency, this time as front-runner.    For much of the 1984 campaign, the Coloradan was disparaged for being cool and aloof. He was probably just shy. This novel should go part of the distance toward dispelling the notion that Mr. Hart lacks the human touch.    There are, to be sure, a lot of the familiar Gary Hart touches to this novel: There are the Kennedy quotations (three of them) that made commentators think him manipulative in 1984. There is the imagery from the old American West. The principal character is &quot;a private man with a public job,&quot; which is how I suspect Mr. Hart thinks of himself.    The very act of writing a novel sets Mr. Hart apart from the rest of the political pack. Imagine Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware or Republican Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas writing about four Americans caught up in anti-U.S. demonstrations in Europe and adding this detail: &quot;A local gang of hooligans, for whom the anti-nuclear movement was incidental, took the Americans from their rooming house, raped the two girls and shaved the heads of all four, then marched them through the streets throwing freezing water on them all the while.&quot; Or try to envision any other presidential candidate writing this sentence: &quot;She slipped, naked, from the bed and parted the heavy folds of the drapes.&quot;    Occasionally, the language seems formulaic: After computers confirm a rocket's &quot;incredibly precise&quot; trajectories, an Air Force general enters his &quot;highly secure&quot; office. Moments later the secretary of defense speaks on a telephone line available only to &quot;very senior administration officials.&quot; Why? They are running some &quot;highly experimental tests.&quot;    But there are some laughs, such as when, in an informal moment, a Soviet negotiator describes a voluptuous woman as a real plate. He means dish.    &quot;Strategies&quot; is set in 1987 and 1988, which infuses it with immediacy, and some of the characters are plainly recognizable. The president, for example, has a staff that is &quot;superb at constructing a cocoon of euphoria all about him.&quot;    The story opens with American military strategists putting in place a plan called Blue Thunder, a scheme to use scheduled U.S. military exercises for an actual mobilization for war against the Soviets. Red Star is the similar Soviet plan, for the Soviets are also preparing for war while pretending to negotiate for peace. And both sides are planning to blind the other's military reconnaissance satellites in a deadly space war 23,000 miles above the earth. The idea is to get into a high level of combat readiness without unduly alarming the other side, then press demands and alter the balance of power.    Or, as a Soviet planner puts it: &quot;When we confront them with carefully deployed conventional forces and highly alert nuclear forces, and then we put out their eyes, they will be as helpless as Samson blinded and weakened.&quot;    Meanwhile, the handsome U.S. negotiator and the attractive Soviet translator, both alarmed at the course of the arms race, undertake an informal arrangement, supplying the other side with information, all in the desperate hope that negotiations won't fail. He wants to know about Soviet anti-satellite research. She wants to know how many cruise missiles the U.S. intends to deploy aboard mobile carriers.    &quot;All I'm trying to do is find out,&quot; says the American, &quot;what would happen if both sides had reasonably strong assurances that the other side was not seeking superiority, not planning some preemptive first strike, not going to use its nuclear arsenal to blackmail the other side.&quot; Of course, that's exactly what both sides are doing.    Their talks lead to a deal that worries hard-liners in both countries. Soon the warriors and the negotiators on both sides are racing each other. It's not a bad story.    But questions linger. Does a spy novel trivialize a presidential candidate? Or does it show depth? Perspective? A sense of humor? And, most of all: Will the Gary Hart story, sometimes a mystery in itself, have a storybook ending?    ---   Mr. Shribman is a reporter in the Journal's Washington bureau.    ---   The full title of the book reviewed yesterday in this space is &quot;Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900.&quot; (See: &quot;LEISURE andamp; ARTS -- Bookshelf: Old Diseases in New World&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 20, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
