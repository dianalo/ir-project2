RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Wednesday limited thefederal tax bite on some business mergers, handing a victory toinvestors and business owners.   In an 8-1 ruling, the justices said a cash payment in sometransactions _ commonly known as a ``boot'' _ should be taxed as acapital gain rather than a dividend taxed as ordinary income.   The capital gain tax rate generally is lower, although the taxreform bill enacted in 1986 largely eliminated the different taxrates for capital gains and ordinary income.   The court said the distinction between tax rates still applies toa significant degree.   For example, it said, taxpayers may deduct capital losses to thefull extent of their capital gains but they only are allowed tooffset up to $3,000 of ordinary income insofar as their capitallosses exceed their capital gains.   Today's case stems from the acquisition of a small West Virginiacompany by a corporation traded on the New York Stock Exchange.   The smaller company, Basin Surveys Inc., was owned by Donald E.Clark of Buckhannon, W.Va. Basin Surveys provides radiation, nuclearand electronic open-hole logging services to the petroleum industry.   Clark sold the business in 1979 to N.L. Industries in New Jersey,which produces petroleum equipment, chemicals and metals.   N.L. Industries gave Clark 300,000 shares of its stock and $3.25million to acquire Basin Surveys. The cash payment is characterizedas ``boot'' in such deals.   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Clark in1987, sparing him from paying $972,505 in tax.   The Supreme Court today agreed with the appeals court that underfederal law because Clark surrendered more than 20 percent of hisinterest in N.L. Industries he was entitled to capital gaintreatment.   The 20 percent figure was based on N.L. Industries offer to Clarkof two choices: he could receive 425,000 shares of N.L. Industriesstock or 300,000 shares plus $3.25 million in cash.   By choosing the latter option, Clark, in effect, gave up morethan 30 percent of his interest in N.L. Industries in return for thecash, the court said.   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court today, saidunder federal law a shareholder who relinquishes more than 20percent of his corporate control and is less than a 50 percentshareholder after the transaction is entitled to have cash proceedsfrom the transaction treated as capital gains.   Stevens said, ``The boot-for-stock exchange in this case mayproperly be characterized as a sale of stock. Significantly...thereis little risk that the reorganization at issue was used as a ruseto distribute dividend.''   Justice Byron R. White dissented.   The case is Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Clark, 87-1168.</TEXT></DOC>
