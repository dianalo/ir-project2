Most people -- those with no more than $100,000 in a bankbacked by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- are coveredin full in the event their bank goes under. And indeed, insome big bank failures, even deposits larger than $100,000have been protected.</LP><TEXT>   Still, there can be surprises, particularly for peoplewith unused lines of credit, high-yielding certificates ofdeposit and delinquent loans.   &quot;The credit dry-up&quot; catches many bank customers off guardwhen a bank fails, says Warren Heller, research director ofVeribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., bank-rating firm. If thebank is taken over by another institution, unused lines ofcredit -- such as those backed by home equity -- aretypically canceled.   That can be a real shock to people planning to use suchcredit lines to make tuition payments, pay for home repairsor finance a wedding. &quot;These aren't the easiest times to runout and establish a new line of credit,&quot; says Mr. Heller.   Small businesses that rely on lines of credit for seasonalbuying may also find themselves in a crunch. Indeed,cancellation of lines of credit in Texas led to the demise ofmany small businesses in the 1980s, Mr. Heller says.   One bit of good news: Credit cards typically aren'taffected, since that line of business is profitable andeasily sold off, says David Barr of the FDIC.   CD holders can also be caught off guard. The FDICguarantees deposits, not the interest rate being paid onthem. Thus, CD holders may find their high-yielding 10%certificates suddenly earning only 5% if their failed bank isbought by another institution.   In Texas -- the state with the most bank failures inrecent years -- depositors cried foul when acquirers begantrimming what had become known as &quot;the Texas premium&quot; on CDrates. But New Englanders, now faced with increased bankclosings, may not yet realize how their certificates ofdeposit could be affected, Mr. Barr says.   Allowable CD-rate changes range from slight adjustments toslashing interest rates all the way to passbook-savingslevels. The new owner of a failed bank has two weeks tonotify customers of any rate change. If the rate is changed,the CD holder can withdraw funds penalty-free.   Of course, an acquirer can opt for business as usual,leaving both CD rates and lines of credit untouched. So far,that's the case with Bank of New England, which was takenover by the FDIC last weekend. The final decision, however,will be made by whoever ultimately acquires that bank.   If no buyer is found for a failed bank, the FDIC will payoff all deposits in full, with interest to the day ofclosing. The worst case scenario? &quot;It could result in peoplenot having access to their funds for a day or two,&quot; says AlanWhitney of the FDIC. He says the longest it has taken fordepositors to get their money is three days.   For depositors, then, the biggest protection is simply tomake sure the bank is covered by the FDIC and that theirdeposits fall within the FDIC rules. The basic insured amountfor a depositor is $100,000 at any one bank.   Dividing a sum larger than $100,000 among multiple depositaccounts (such as checking, savings or CDs) won't increase anindividual's coverage, nor does it help to list your name invarious ways (such as spelling it out in full on one accountand using your first and middle initials for another). Butpeople who are careful in their choice of individual, jointand trust accounts can increase their total coverage at asingle bank beyond $100,000.   Because the FDIC regulations are full of lots of fineprint, covering everything from joint accounts to mortgageescrow accounts, people with $100,000 or more in a bankshould check with the bank to make sure it's all covered.&quot;For a large depositor, and someone with more than $100,000is a large depositor, they should be able to put you in touchwith someone who can explain it,&quot; says Joseph Belew,president of the Consumer Bankers Association, an industrytrade group in Arlington, Va.   Veribanc's Mr. Heller says some people may simply want totake a conservative approach: &quot;One person, one bank,$100,000,&quot; he says.   Bank customers should also note that if they have adelinquent loan, they may not get their full deposit backeven if they follow that rule. In cases of delinquent loans,the FDIC will adjust for the overdue amount, deducting itbefore issuing checks.   The specter of being unable to get any cash for two orthree days has many people rethinking their basic cashmanagement techniques. &quot;In the past, just for convenience, itmade sense to consolidate accounts,&quot; says Edward McCarthy, aProvidence, R.I., financial planner. Now he's recommendingclients set up some source of emergency cash, be it anaccount at a second bank, a credit card that allows cashadvances or even savings bonds that can be cashed at anysavings institution.   Another technique for calming bank jitters: check banksafety with a rating service such as Veribanc. While notinfallible, the chance of problems is greatly reduced if you&quot;select a bank that has one of the highest ratings,&quot; saysRichard D. Driscoll of the Massachusetts Bankers Association.   ---          How to Tell if Your Bank Is in Trouble                                                                                                          Here are some of the things banking-industry executivesand analysts say customers can do to help gauge a bank'ssafety.                                                                                                          CHECK THE CAPITAL LEVEL                                                                                                          A solid bank's capital should be more than 6% of assets,according to a target set for this year as part of aninternational treaty. To find out, Joseph Belew, president ofthe Consumer Bankers Association, an industry trade group,says, &quot;I'd start at the top, not at the bottom,&quot; and call thechief financial officer's office.                                                                                                          WATCH THE STOCK PRICE                                                                                                          &quot;If you believe the market's smart,&quot; says Mr. Belew, a bigdrop can signal trouble. Bank of New England Corp.'s stockprice, which began 1990 at more than $9 a share, fell to lessthan $1 in the days before the banking company was taken overby regulators.                                                                                                          LOOK AT LENDING ACTIVITY                                                                                                          The bank's loan portfolio should be diversified, notheavily concentrated in foreign debt or real estate. AlexSheshunoff, president of Sheshunoff Information Services inAustin, Texas, says just reading the local newspaper canhelp: A report about your bank's recent financial performancewill tell if it's profitable and whether problem loans areincreasing.                                                                                                          ASK ABOUT RATINGS                                                                                                          Banks should be able to tell you how their securities arerated by major services like Moody's Investors Service Inc.and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. You can also check with yourbroker. Veribanc Inc., one frequently mentioned bank-ratingservice, supplies safety ratings over the phone for a priceof $10 for the first bank and $3 for each additional bank(1-800-442-2657).</TEXT></DOC>
