From Monday night's warbling rendition of the Star SpangledBanner by radio personality Garrison Keillor to Thursday night'sacceptance speeches by Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen, theDemocratic Party has spent many months and many millions on aprogram to boost its chances of winning the White House.   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis marches into Dixie on Sunday as theunquestioned nominee of his party. He has more than enoughdelegates to crush any attempt by Jackson to alter the bare bonesplatform he decreed, and more than enough clout to make sure theconvention ratifies his choice of Texas Sen. Bentsen as runningmate.   But it will be up to Jackson, who has the allegiance of roughlyone quarter of the convention's 4,210 delegates, to decide howunified and harmonious a front the party presents to the four-nightprime time audience.   As Dukakis' last remaining rival for the nomination, he haspromised repeatedly to support the Democratic ticket this fall. Buthe angrily broke off platform negotiations with Dukakis last weekafter learning of Bentsen's selection from a reporter rather thanfrom the governor himself.   Whatever Jackson decides _ whether he contests the platform,tries to challenge Bentsen's spot on the ticket or leaves the Omnito lead the thousands of supporters who say they will be in thestreets _ New Englander Dukakis' nomination will be spiced with asouthern flavor.   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas will preside as chairman andTexas State Treasurer Ann Richards will deliver the keynote addressthat is the highlight of Monday night's opening session. ArkansasGov. Bill Clinton will place Dukakis' name in nomination on Tuesdaynight in another bow to a region of the country that Democrats usedto win regularly in presidential elections, but now seems largelyout of reach.   On the first night, the assembled Democrats also will hear fromformer President Jimmy Carter, a native Georgian who once served asgovernor.   Tuesday night's program is expected to begin with the platformand end with a speech by Jackson, with appearances by Sen. EdwardM. Kennedy and other party leaders in between.   Jackson's forces have prepared several minority planks to theplatform, and while a vote on some or all is possible, thedifferences also may be ironed out in advance. Delegates will see avideo presentation about Jackson, to be introduced by his children.   The party picks its nominee on Wednesday, with Dukakis andJackson the only names entered into nomination.   Bentsen will be picked for vice president on Thursday _ with orwithout a fight by the Jackson forces _ and then he and Dukakiswill deliver their acceptance speeches.   Party officials say that anyone interested in challengingBentsen's nomination must submit a petition with between 300 and600 delegate signatures by Thursday morning. Jackson has more thanenough supporters in the hall to accomplish that, if he wants.   Whatever else happens, there will be the usual streetdemonstrations outside the hall. Rumors circulated that the Ku KluxKlan would stage a demonstration, and party spokesman Mike McCurrysaid Democratic officials are concerned about the threat ofviolence.   ``That does concern the party ... we're well prepared to dealwith any situation that arises,'' he said.   Republicans have set up a beachhead in the Democrats' host city,and have arranged for several prominent officials to take pot shotseach day at Dukakis and Bentsen.   The host city was busy sprucing itself up for its four days inthe glare of nationwide publicity. Municipal workers placedplanters with vibrantly colored flowers along the streets near theconvention hall.   Dukakis campaign volunteers decorated the city with politicalposters, and workers in the downtown hotels polished and repolishedevery available surface in anticipation of the arrival of thedelegates.   Dukakis goes into the convention with a modest lead over GeorgeBush in the public opinion polls, and he and his high command hopeto use the week to pad the margin.   In appearances inside the convention hall and out, theMassachusetts governor will follow a schedule designed to stressthe themes that secured him the Democratic nomination and that heintends to repeat in the fall.   Rather than spend his time speaking only to party delegatecaucuses, Dukakis is expected to spend part of his day campaigningaway from the hall and the glass and steel downtown hotels thathouse many of the delegates.   A trip to a factory gate is a possibility, to dramatize hissupport for the plant closing law that Congress is sending toPresident Reagan's desk. He may also visit a school to emphasizehis opposition to drugs.   Aside from the prime time appearances on network television _including the morning shows on Monday and his acceptance speech onThursday _ he is expected to make himself available for televisioninterviews by satellite with stations around the country.   Aides say he will stress his commitment to creating jobs and hissupport for health care and education, and sound the theme ofethics in government.   He and other speakers are expected to stress Dukakis' ethnicroots, and the governor will be introduced to the convention andthe television audience on Thursday night by his cousin,Oscar-winning actress Olympia Dukakis.   Dukakis' nomination will mark the end of a marathon run for theparty's top prize.   He began the campaign as merely one of ``seven dwarfs'' seekingthe nomination. Just as methodically as he raised millions ofcampaign dollars, he methodically dispatched one rival afteranother in the early primaries and caucuses.   By the time New York held its primary in mid-April, the race hadbeen narrowed to Dukakis and Jackson, and there was never any doubtabout which of them would win.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 17</NOTE></DOC>
