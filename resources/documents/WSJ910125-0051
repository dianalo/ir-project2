In the absence of any compelling news on either theeconomic or political fronts yesterday, the U.S. currencymoved listlessly in a narrow range that seemed to be definedonly by technical support at one end and resistance levels atthe other.</LP><TEXT>   One market participant called it &quot;the old elevator story&quot;:After testing the downside limits, the dollar was carriedback up by moderate position-squaring and buying interest atits low point.   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at1.4865 marks, up from 1.4830 marks late Wednesday, and at132.35 yen, up from 131.90 yen a day earlier. Sterling wastrading at $1.9565, down from $1.9598 late Wednesday.   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 132.35yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 131.65 yen. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at 1.4885 marks, up from 1.4834marks at Thursday's close.   Although traders acknowledged that the Gulf war continuesto provide some support for the dollar, &quot;the market isgetting dulled by news out of the Persian Gulf,&quot; said TomBenfer, senior marketing representative at Bank of Montrealin New York. Even a military retaliation by Israel againstIraq, which many fear would weaken the unity of the U.S.-ledcoalition fighting to expel the Iraqis from Kuwait, might nothave much of an impact on this war-weathered market now, Mr.Benfer said.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater's warning that thewar could last months barely ruffled the market, and reportsthat Iraqi fighter planes trying to attack allied positionsin Saudi Arabia had been rebuffed likewise got littlereaction.   &quot;Unless something dramatic happens, people are trying nowto decipher the economic implications of war,&quot; rather thanthe military picture, said Marc Chandler of IDEA, an analyticservice in New York.   As the market takes the war-risk premium out of thedollar's value, the prospect of lower U.S. interest ratesoffers a continuing incentive to let the dollar drop. Lowerinterest rates mean lower returns for holders ofdollar-denominated investments.   But after two days of frequent, if sometimescontradictory, pronouncements on the interest-rate outlook byU.S. and German central bankers, that front was quietyesterday too.   Around midafternoon in New York, reports of large Japanesebuy orders sent the dollar up to an intraday high of 132.60yen. Traders, however, still expect a near-term reduction inthe federal funds rate, or rate on overnight loans betweenbanks, and therefore a dollar decline.   While some market participants said that an extremely poorreport today on U.S. gross national product for the fourthquarter might trigger a Fed easing, more seem to expect areduction a little later, possibly after next Friday'srelease of January U.S. employment figures.   The average forecast of economists surveyed by AP-DowJones News Service is for a 3.1% decline in fourth-quarterGNP. If the data show a decline of less than 3%, Bank ofMontreal's Mr. Benfer said, the dollar might manage a rally.   Others said that if the numbers are poor, a drop in thedollar might present a good buying opportunity, figuring thatthe currency's downside risk is limited by the Gulf war andby a tacit agreement among the Group of Seven leadingindustrial democracies not to let the dollar plummet.   Offering the dollar moderate strength yesterday werereports that Soviet troops accompanying a column of armoredcars opened fire on two vehicles near Vilnius, Lithuania,wounded one person and arrested another.   Mr. Chandler said the latest in a series of troublingreports from the Soviet Union -- often overshadowed lately bythe Gulf war -- injected some caution into the tendency tosell the dollar against the mark. But the majority of themarket still seems to lean toward the selling side, waitingfor dollar rallies to take profits, he said.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $373 an ounce, down $5.40. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at$374.25 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
