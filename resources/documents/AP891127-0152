(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder was declaredelected governor Monday, but Republican J. Marshall Coleman askedfor a recount and an investigation of alleged irregularities inVirginia's closest gubernatorial election.   Coleman's announcement came about three hours before the StateBoard of Elections reported that Wilder received 897,139 votes to890,285 for Coleman out of nearly 1.8 million cast, for a margin of6,854 votes, or .38 percent.   Unofficial results had shown Wilder, the nation's first electedblack governor, ahead by 6,852 votes. State law allows for ataxpayer-funded recount if the margin is less than half a percent.   Coleman, a former state attorney general, said he would seek arecount and ask the Democrat-controlled General Assembly toinvestigate alleged election irregularities in the Nov. 7 balloting.   In a notice to General Assembly leaders stating he intends tocontest the result, Coleman said voter registration lists used inthe election contained the names of people ineligible to vote.   ``In an election as close as this one, irregularities whichwould not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume agreater importance,'' Coleman said in an accompanying letter.   Coleman's attorney, William H. Hurd, declined to give details ofthe allegations. ``There are a number of areas that we're lookinginto,'' he said.   Coleman had until Dec. 7 to request a recount but Monday was thedeadline for contesting the election because of allegedirregularities.   He said he would withdraw the challenge if the recount and otherinformation convinces him that the proceeding is ``no longernecessary to safeguard the accuracy and integrity'' of the election.   Democrats have no problem with Coleman's request for a recount,but his contesting the election is ``a very cynical approach topolitics,'' said Virginia Democratic Chairman Lawrence H. FrammeIII.   ``The entire electoral process was marked by a high degree ofintegrity,'' Framme said.   Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor, said he would proceedwith plans for his administration that began just after he claimedvictory election night. He will be inaugurated Jan. 13.   The recount will be overseen by a panel of three judges headedby the chief judge of the Richmond Circuit Court. If Colemanproceeds with contesting the election after the recount, the matterwould go before the privileges and elections committees of theGeneral Assembly, said state Sen. Stanley C. Walker, president protempore of the Senate.   Walker, who once won a contested election for his Senate seat,said the proceeding would resemble a trial with both sidespresenting witnesses and evidence to the legislators. Thecommittees' recommendation would go to the full House and Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
