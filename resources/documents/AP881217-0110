Horacio Jaunarena said civilians who applauded a March 1976military coup must share some responsibility for the campaign bysecurity forces, known as the Dirty War, that killed 9,000Argentines. He called the action necessary.   The repression remains a burning political issue and the questionof whether it was necessary in order to end chaos divides Argentina,which resumed civilian rule in 1985 after the military returned tothe barracks.   Jaunarena's remarks, in a speech to newly commissioned officers,is an apparent attempt to placate military resentment that burstforth in a four-day insurrection earlier this month and lingersdespite the acceptance by the government of a key rebel demand _ apay increase.   ``The great part of the (1970s) struggle was outside theframework of constitutional governments, leaving open to questionthe political and legal legitimacy of a battle that was necessary,''Jaunarena told the officers at the Military College.   The military view is that it fought an unconventional war againstleftist guerrillas using unconventional means and deserves a betterrole in society. The view by human rights groups is that whathappened amounted to organized murder.   ``The phenomenon (terrorism) was eliminated, but not the rebuke''by society, he said. ``We should admit that we made a mistake. Arewe going to keep trying to put all the blame on one side ... or arewe going to accept the reality that is evident to every sensibleArgentine?''   He said civilians in 1976 wanted an end to the bombings,assassinations and kidnappings that had become almost dailyoccurrences, and must share the responsibility.   ``The coups through which we Argentines have lived were not theexclusive action of the military,'' Jaunarena said.   While the army fought guerrilla battles with the People'sRevolutionary Army, security forces as a whole have been condemnedfor arresting several thousand Argentine citizens _ allegedsympathesizers _ who ``disappeared'' and were presumed executed.   The presence of President Raul Alfonsin at the Military Collegeindicated that Jaunarena spoke for the government.   ``It is necessary to bring to an end a period of mutual scorn andreciprocal ignorance,'' Jaunarena said. ``Our society has gonethrough a crisis which should be confronted with the essential keyof unity.''   A day before, army chief Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi said in a TVinterview that he agreed with demands made by rebel commander Col.Mohamed Ali Seineldin, including the need to reintegrate the armedforces into society as valued members.   ``I say emphatically: there was a war against subversion and itis absolutely unjust to accuse the armed forces of genocide,''Caridi said.   The rebels demanded an end to the prosecution of officers forhuman rights abuses committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship, ashakeup of the command structure, and a bigger military budget.   Alfonsin and leaders of the opposition Peronist Party have saidpublicly that they oppose any amnesty for officers already convictedof human rights abuses, or under prosecution on murder and torturecharges.   In December 1985, a civilian court convicted five former militaryjunta members, including ex-military Presidents Jorge Videla andRoberto Viola, for human rights abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
