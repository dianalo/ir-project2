At least 106 people, including 83 police, have been injured inthe violence that began Tuesday in the Nishinari district of Osaka,Japan's No. 2 city. More than 40 people have been arrested.   The scope of the violence is extremely unusual for Japan, wherepublic issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree.   The rundown neighborhood is known for its gangs, transientlaborers and shabby hotels. Locals say there long have been badfeelings between the area's poor residents and police.   ``Dogs of gangsters, come out, kneel down before us andapologize!'' a man screamed through a loudspeaker to police.``Don't you know how much hardship our daily laborers are goingthrough? Why don't you try working at a construction site one dayand you will probably realize how much we are abused by thissociety.''   By 1 a.m. Saturday, a crowd estimated earlier at more than 1,000laborers from the district and outside youths had dwindled to about600, police said. But many laborers had dispersed and thoseremaining were largely high school-age youths, some of whomappeared to be enjoying themselves.   One was an 11-year-old boy who said he was ``just here to be ontelevision.''   A man who refused to identify himself said he had come fromKyoto, 30 miles away, because ``I thought this may be a once in alifetime chance for me throw stones at police and get away withit.''   Most of the crowd had filtered away by 3 a.m. Saturday, leavingbehind a street littered with broken glass, rocks and burneddebris. A cordon of about 20 armed troopers continued to guard thepolice station.   Earlier, about 2,500 police carrying large metal shields were inposition along main roads in Nishinari and in front of the districtpolice station Friday night. Four vehicles equipped with watercannons guarded the station's main entrance.   Police used the water cannons repeatedly to douse the more than1,000 people confronting them. The crowd, which included daylaborers from the district and young people from outside it,scattered each time but then regrouped.   Large piles of burned vehicles and bicycles formed barricadesand blocked traffic. Protesters threw firebombs and rocks.   ``We are now starting to arrest the main figures, especially theones who are agitating the crowd,'' police Sgt. Rentaro Ataka saidaround midnight.   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said10,000 more riot police were on alert to prevent another night ofrioting. About 100 undercover police also were mobilized, theysaid.   Rioting did not spread beyond the neighborhood, but it causedtraffic tie-ups in parts of Osaka as police blocked off severalmajor streets, and some rail service was disrupted.   The violence was touched off Tuesday by the arrest of a localpoliceman on suspicion of having taken $81,000 in bribes from twogangsters.   After hearing the news, menial laborers with longstandinggrudges against police began massing around the police station.Authorities and residents said young hooligans and leftists fromoutside the district later joined the disturbance.   Rentarou Ataka, a police spokesman in Nishinari, said youthsfrom outside the area had seen the initial rioting on televisionand decided to join in. He described other troublemakers as``ultraleftists,'' but said the scope of their participation wasunclear.   In recent years, there have been few such disturbances in Japanother than occasional battles between riot police and leftistextremists who oppose expansion of Tokyo's Narita airport.   Police reported two stores were set ablaze early Friday and atrain station also was heavily damaged by fire. Several shops,including a 24-hour convenience store, were looted.   Osaka's police chief, Masahiro Tsubakihara, issued an apologyfor the officer, who was arrested after reports he providedinformation about police operations against gangs.</TEXT></DOC>
