WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The NATO defense ministers today openeda two-day session to review the long-range nuclear arms strategy ofthe Western alliance.   The session involves an assessment of how NATO must adjust itsnuclear arms after a 1983 decision to remove 1,400 nuclear warheadsfrom Europe and the signing in December of the superpower accord toscrap hundreds of intermediate-range nuclear missiles.   NATO officials said U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carluccibriefed his counterparts on preparations in the United States andthe Soviet Union for an elaborate, 13-year inspection system tocheck compliance with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, or INF,treaty.   Carlucci also gave an update on Moscow's efforts to modernizeits nuclear arms, sources reported.   Carlucci arrived Tuesday and met with U.S. Gen. John Galvin,NATO's top military commander in Europe, and NATO Secretary GeneralLord Carrington in advance of the ministerial meeting.   It is the first session of defense ministers since the Dec. 8signing of the U.S.-Soviet accord to eliminate two classes ofground-launched nuclear missiles.   The ministers' meeting comes as hopes have dimmed that anEast-West treaty to cut strategic nuclear arms by 50 percent can besigned at the May 29-June 2 meeting in Moscow between PresidentReagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in Brussels thisweek said it would be ``extremely difficult'' to get a treaty bythe end of May.   But Shultz said the Reagan administration will keep negotiatingbeyond the Moscow summit for a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty thathe said has broad bipartisan support in the United States.   The ministerial meeting was moved to the NATO headquarters fromDenmark because of a political crisis there over nuclear armspolicy.   The Danish government was defeated April 14 on a parliamentarymotion demanding visiting warships be told they cannot bringnuclear arms into Danish ports. NATO officials have complained thatthe motion, if implemented, would undermine NATO's defense strategyfor Denmark.   U.S. and British warships, which would play a key role indefending Denmark in times of crisis or war, never say if theycarry nuclear arms.   Britain already has suspended Royal Navy visits to Denmarkbecause of the crisis, which led the minority center-rightgovernment to call for early elections May 10.   The defense ministers will review their long-term nuclear armsplanning in light of the goals NATO has set for itself in recentyears, said allied officials.   NATO has 4,600 nuclear warheads in Europe, 2,400 fewer that ithad in 1983. It studies adjustments to its nuclear deterrentthrough arms modernization and redeployment without raising thenumber of warheads. The studies deal with developing a new,short-range Lance ground-to-ground missile, a tacticalair-to-ground missile and improved nuclear artillery shells.   The idea of modernizing short-range nuclear arms, most of whichare based in West Germany, has stirred opposition there.   The West German government fears that, as medium-range missilesdisappear under the INF treaty, the improved short-range arms willmake West Germany a more likely target for Soviet attack.   West Germany prefers short-range nuclear arms talks in tandemwith conventional arms talks, scheduled to start in Vienna thisfall.   So do its allies. But they, notably the United States andBritain, say the short-range arms still must be modernized by themid-1990s under a decision made in 1983. To meet the deadline, theU.S. Congress must approve initial funds for the new weapons by1990.</TEXT></DOC>
