Both problems are addressed by the Novopen, asimple-to-use injection device produced by a unit ofDenmark's Novo Nordisk. The Novopen is compact and nonmedicalin appearance and does away with most of the gear previouslyneeded by diabetics.   A user doesn't have to bother with vials of insulin; thedose is in cartridges that fit into the body of the penlikedevice. Dosage is regulated with a twist of the Novopen'scylindrical stem, and the injection is given with a push of abutton.   &quot;People like it because of sheer convenience and the factyou don't look like a drug addict,&quot; says Bernard Sams, 59years old and principal designer at London's Sams Design, wholed the team that developed the pen.   Jorgen Elnegaard, Novo Nordisk's president of diabetescare, says nearly 10% of the developed world's diabetics haveswitched to the pen-delivery system in the past severalyears. Competitors are devising similar devices, some ofwhich -- including the Novopen -- are available in the U.S.   The Novopen and other finalists in a BBC designcompetition reflect a renaissance in British industrialdesign. Buoyed by the nation's economic and industrialturnaround of the '80s, the return to internationalprominence follows years of such disasters as thecockroach-shaped British Leyland cars of the 1970s.   The three finalists described here underscore Britishskill at using common materials -- such as plastics andunalluring metals -- in economical and user-friendly ways.The winners will be selected in a BBC special Sunday.                                                                                                          Computer Hopes It Has   Keyboard to Success                                                                                                          THE AGENDA, a new entry in the &quot;palmtop&quot; computer market,replicates a court stenographer's keyboard to speed typing.But with the market already crowded, Microwriter Systemsfaces an uphill battle.   The Agenda is a checkbook-sized computer whose 32kilobytes (20 typed pages) of standard memory are expandableto 96 kilobytes. It's an electronic organizer, calculator andword processor.   Agenda's edge -- and drawback -- is its quick-entry textsystem. It has a normal 26-character keyboard, but alsofeatures a text-entry system called microwriting, whichallows users to type faster than most touch typists bymastering a system of keystrokes on five extra keys.   Learning the system takes at least several days ofdiligent study. Mastering the Agenda also means learning anew operating system, the basic instructions on which acomputer runs, which many PC users could resist. &quot;People whofind it is important to them learn quickly,&quot; says Sir MarkWeinberg, Microwriter chairman. He adds that with optionalsoftware, an Agenda can be easily hooked into an officepersonal computer.   Though its nifty design distinguishes the Agenda from itscompetitors, Sir Mark concedes that the greater marketingmuscle of such rivals as Sharp puts closely held MicrowriterSystems at a disadvantage. Microwriter is considering a jointventure or sale of a large stake to one of a number of largercomputer markers.                                                                                                          Trying to Change   Image of Microscopes                                                                                                          IN VICTORIAN times, says British businessman KeithDunning, most middle- and upper-class British householdsproudly displayed a microscope in their living rooms. But thedevice's design &quot;has changed so little over the past hundredyears that it no longer has much appeal as an object,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Dunning's company, Science of Cambridge, is trying tochange that. Earlier this year it began making the Lensman, apocket-size microscope. The Lensman magnifies imageshorizontally, through an origami-like system of foldedmirrors, rather than vertically as in most microscopes.   The battery-powered Lensman, which weighs less than nineounces and is four inches wide, magnifies at 80 times and 200times, about half the usual college-laboratory maximum.Students are an obvious market, but Mr. Dunning hopes formore interest from such professionals and hobbyists asveterinarians, police officers and environmentalists whocould use portable magnifying power in their work.   But the Lensman has drawbacks. Many professionals needmore power than it can provide, and its light source is toodark for some uses. Still, Mr. Dunning says Science ofCambridge is working on both lower-powered and higher-poweredmodels. He says his company has sold several hundred Lensmensince May.</TEXT></DOC>
