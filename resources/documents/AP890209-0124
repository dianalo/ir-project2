They were chosen from a pool of 45 picates to the pilotsthat it may be in theirinterest to honor a (Machinists) picket line,'' said Air Line PilotsAssociation spokesman Ron Cole. ``There appears to be a feeling onthe company's part that there is no incentive to negotiate with us,with pilots crossing the picket line. That could be very poorjudgment on the company's part.''   Cole said his union was making unspecified preparations in casepilots decided to honor the picket lines, but no final decisionwould come until an actual strike by the Machinists.   The Machinists, meanwhile, were voting on whether to authorize astrike, and militant talk pervaded the ranks.   ``We're ready to rock 'n' roll,'' Frank Majors, a 21-year veteranline mechanic, said after voting to authorize the strike atMachinists Local 702, across the street from company headquarters.``It's matter of principle, mainly. It's just time.''   Majors referred to the demand for $150 million in union wage cutsby the management that was installed after the Texas Air Corp., ledby Chairman Frank Lorenzo, acquired Eastern nearly three years ago.   Union officials predicted overwhelming approval of a strike,which could come if no settlement is reached in their 16-month-oldcontract dispute by midnight March 3.   The head of the local Eastern's Machinists, Charles Bryan, saidThursday that Eastern is trying to ``contract out or take the workaway'' from Eastern employees in violation of federal labor law.   ``They are now telling all employees to cease production, wrapup, package and box up the parts and send them out for other peopleto repair them,'' Bryan said. ``We're probably going to be infederal court to have that stopped.''   The company has said it would have no comment on the strike votethat began Monday in Eastern locals nationwide. The vote willconclude Feb. 14 in Atlanta.   A National Mediation Board negotiator is continuing efforts togain an agreement between the two sides, although no recent progresshas been reported.   ``We have had tremendous turnout,'' said Frank Ortis, the4,000-member Miami local's vice president. ``At 6 a.m., they werelined up at the door waiting to come in. In 1{ hours, we ran 900people through here.''   As shift changes came, Machinists wearing red union T-shirtsmarched from the airport to the local hall. The 8,500 Machinistscomprise 30 percent of Eastern's workforce.   The Miami Herald reported Thursday that System One, thedata-processing unit of Texas Air, is ready to supply volunteerbackup workers to handle baggage, aircraft cleaning and other suchchores in the event of a strike.   The Miami local vote Thursday followed two days of sporadic jobactions by the Machinists at Miami International Airport. TheMachinists said they were protesting forced overtime.   Company spokesman Robin Matell said 100 Machinists involved in amass walkout Tuesday were given 10-day suspensions and that moresuch discipline was possible. Eastern said its contract withMachinists includes mandatory overtime if conditions necessitate theextra hours of work.   The number of employees participating in Tuesday's three-hourwalkout swelled at one point to up to 1,000, and the company saidthere were two smaller, shorter walkouts Wednesday.   Eastern's flight schedule hasn't been disrupted, the company said.   Ortis said some union members received suspension notices by mailwhile others were ordered to surrender identification badges whenthey reported for work. He said the union will appeal thesuspensions.</TEXT></DOC>
