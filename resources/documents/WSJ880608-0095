(but never that you have won) . . . a new Chevrolet, a big-money savings bond, a free vacation on the Costa Del Sol, or some other appealing prize.    All you have to do to get the prize is supply a little information to the caller or respond to the phone number on the post card. What have you got to lose?    The answer may be anywhere from $299 to $398, depending on who is making the &quot;award.&quot; The so-called boiler rooms, where dozens of well-coached hucksters crowd into telephone cubicles armed with clever scripts -- the kind of operations that once pitched aluminum siding, then graduated to overpriced gemstones and &quot;naked&quot; commodity options -- have moved into phony credit-card billing.    &quot;That's the fraud du jour,&quot; says Eileen Harrington, a Federal Trade Commission lawyer, of the latest telemarketing scam that's sweeping the country.    As the scammers collect information they say will qualify a person for a prize, they inevitably ask for a credit-card number -- either to verify identity, or for a guarantee that the customer pays a sales tax or some other excuse. And during the conversation something is said about supplying a service or product.    Next thing the victims know, there's an unexplained charge on their credit-card bill. A spokesman for Visa USA Inc. says Visa cardholders are losing as much as $50 million a year in such billings.    That may be only the tip of the total problem. The overall annual take apparently is many times that. David Shephard, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who headed a multiagency task force against telemarketing credit-card frauds in Las Vegas, Nev., says boiler rooms in that city alone have been reaping from $700 million to $1.2 billion a year. He bases that estimate on records found in recent raids on 17 of nearly 200 operations he says were in Las Vegas a few months ago.    Mr. Shephard says his task force -- including investigators from the Internal Revenue Service, Secret Service, Postal Service, FTC and four city and state agencies -- succeeded in closing more than 100 operations, but the effort still hasn't resulted in any criminal indictments. Most of the closed operations, he says, have simply moved on to cities in other states, such as Denver, Phoenix and Houston.    The FTC and various state agencies have filed civil actions against such operations, and Better Business Bureaus around the country have issued warnings. In one case, the FTC won a federal court judgment of $6.6 million May 4 against a Chicago concern that it alleged bilked 28,000 families around the country of about $10 million.    So far, the agency's Ms. Harrington concedes, the FTC hasn't collected a dime in the case, though it is trying to seize the houses of the company's two principal officers and any bank accounts they have. The FTC can't bring criminal charges.    Federal law says posting phony credit-card bills is a form of counterfeiting, so responsibility for criminally policing credit-card crooks is given to the Secret Service, a branch of the Treasury Department. Because it doesn't segregate statistics on telemarketing credit-card cases, the service says it doesn't know how many have been prosecuted.    But under the service's interpretation of the law -- says spokeswoman Jane Vezeris -- the boiler-room operators can and usually do protect themselves in two ways: They never say someone has actually &quot;won&quot; whatever it is they are trying to make the person believe is being awarded, and they do provide some product or service to justify the credit-card charge.    The most frequent products delivered for this purpose have been vitamins (a half-dozen tablets to be taken one a month) and certificates entitling the holder to supposed discounts on vacation packages. (In fact, the vacations, if taken, are full-priced or overpriced, investigators say.) Other items have included magazine subscriptions, portable radios (described on prize-announcement post cards as stereo home entertainment systems) and shedding rabbit pelts (described as ladies' fur coats).    Though worth little, these items can keep the Secret Service at bay. Explains Ms. Vezeris: &quot;If in fact they (the victims) get something, it may not be what they like, but if they have voluntarily given their (credit card) number, it's not a criminal matter, it's a consumer fraud. If you tell me you're going to send me a transportation package, and you send me a certificate and I find out later there are a lot of extras I'm going to have to pay for, we send those over to the FTC&quot; for civil action.    Such vacation certificates, worthless without the paid extras, were exactly the product distributed by Amy Travel Services, the Chicago concern that the FTC just won a $6.6 million civil judgment against. But civil judgments don't always put the people out of business.    &quot;When we caught up with these guys, they were already under orders from six different state courts,&quot; says the FTC's Ms. Harrington. &quot;They just set up shop in another state.&quot;    Robert Bennett of Houston, attorney for Amy's principals, says his clients &quot;could have exercised better business judgment.&quot; But he denies fraud on their part and says 10,000 customers took trips related to the certificates. He also concedes his clients have signed consent judgments settling charges in Texas and other states but says the $6.6 million Chicago judgment has been stayed pending appeal.    Despite the Secret Service's declared policy of not treating consumer frauds as criminal offenses, at least one agent, Ronald Williams in Los Angeles, says his office has won convictions in three such cases. The most recent, he says, involved a &quot;travel&quot; company that hired 400 salesmen working four shifts a day to make 250,000 calls around the country, telling people they had been selected to receive free vacations in Hawaii.    Mr. Williams says the company welshed on its phone bills, in part by using stolen telephone credit cards. It also lacked a banking relationship. To collect on its Visa and MasterCard slips, the company sold them at a discount to merchants in legitimate businesses. One principal in the Los Angeles company was sentenced to six years in prison; the other skipped bail.    The similarity of so many far-flung schemes could indicate mob involvement. &quot;They are very similar all over the country,&quot; says Richard Sauer, an FTC attorney, adding that the schemes tend to use &quot;the same language, and often they will offer the same four prizes. There may be a kind of franchise operation going on.&quot;    Mr. Sauer and others say, however, the similarities could result from networking among people long-practiced in the field, all looking for ideas that have worked elsewhere. For example, they say the uniform price of about $350 for products or services is just under what might attract special attention on credit-card bills.    Meanwhile, Rosemary Bonta, who supervises the Fort Myers, Fla., office of the Better Business Bureau, says her area is a hotbed of boiler-room activity. She's still waiting, she says, for a promised law-enforcement crackdown against companies whose names and principals are well known to her.    Pending that, she advises people not to give their credit-card numbers over the phone to companies they don't know. If they do get hooked, she says, they should avail themselves of their right to refuse to pay an item on their monthly card bill and ask the bank to charge the amount back to the biller's account. </TEXT></DOC>
