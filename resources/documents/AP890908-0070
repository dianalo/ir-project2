About 55,000 people will leave Hong Kong in 1990, up from aprojected 42,000 in 1989, Mike Rowse, head of a government taskforce on emigration, told reporters today. A private emigrationspecialist said both figures are low.   Lack of confidence in Hong Kong's future caused by China'scrackdown on a movement for freedom is the main reason for theprojected increase, he said.   The expected exodus is already damaging Hong Kong, Rowse said ofthe 409-square-mile British colony of islands and peninsulatransformed into an economic powerhouse by its hard-working people.   Talented people are leaving the colony, hurting variousindustries, he said, and their departure affects the morale of thosewho stay.   The territory on the southern Chinese coast reverts to Beijing in1997 under an agreement signed in 1984 by Britain and China. Beijinghas promised to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling economic systemfor 50 years, but many in the colony do not believe that.   Since the June 3-4 crackdown, thousands in Hong Kong have beenclamoring for the right to settle in Britain, but the Britishgovernment has refused.   London currently is working on a nationality package that willgive some Hong Kong residents the right to live in Britain.   Rowse criticized the British government for looking at thepackage purely ``in terms of Asian immigration and not as a matterof principle.''   ``The Hong Kong people were never given an opportunity to decidewhat they wanted ... nor were they represented in the BritishParliament which took the decision,'' he said. ``I think we have toask: Is that fair?''   Last year, 45,800 people emigrated from Hong Kong, mostly to theUnited States, Australia and Canada. The figure marked a 35 percentincrease over 1987 and a 51 percent jump from 1980, the first yearstatistics were kept.   This year, the government has projected emigration will fallabout 4,000.   An emigration specialist claimed the projections are low.   ``The only way emigration will fall is because consulates in HongKong are getting too many applications and there is a backlog,''said Horatio Cheung, of the Hong Kong Freedom of Movement and Rightsof Abode. ``It would in no way reflect people's desire to get out.''   Government figures show the number of requests for certificatesof no criminal convictions, a document required by many countries,doubled in July and August of this year when compared to the samemonths last year.   In an interview, Cheung said the colony faces ``a catastrophicbrain drain'' and that he doubts efforts by China, Britain and thecolony will succeed in calming people's fears.   Government statistics released Thursday indicate the average HongKong emigrant has five times more chance of being college-educatedand employed as a professional than the average colony resident.Emigrants also are younger.</TEXT></DOC>
