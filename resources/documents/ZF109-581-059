(Set Expert On)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Olympia, P.L.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Programmers can import data from a program while running anotherusing disk-based file storage or without disk files.andP;  Threemethods use the disk-based style.andP;  One creates a scratch file andloads the other program's text into it.andP;  The dBASE catalog can beused as a scratch file if there are no .dbf files left on thedisk.andP;  The other two methods, created by Andrew Schulman, arecalled Makemem and Makedbf.andP;  Makemem turns DOS command outputsinto dBASE variables which are then turned into files accessibleby the dBASE application.andP;  Makedbf takes data from the externalprogram and turns it into records of a database.andP;  Three methodsthat do not include disk files are the environment, keyboardstuffer, and screen capture.andP;  The first involves defining a DOSenvironment and assigning a string value that the dBASEapplication can retrieve.andP;  The second has the keyboard filled withdata from the external program which can be accessed by therunning application.andP;  Screen capture uses a .bin routine thatallows the application to read data off the screen written by theprogram.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Programming InstructionData Base DesignData Management.andO;Feature:   illustrationprogram.andO;Caption:   dBASE IV code segment.
