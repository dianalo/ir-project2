The decision emerged at the end of a one-day meeting oftransport ministers and chief executives of the industrial partnersin the European commercial aircraft group.   Aviation industry observers said it was the latest display ofEurope's eagerness to penetrate the lucrative U.S. market whiletrying to reduce trade friction over American claims of unfaircompetition by Airbus.   Trade negotiators from the United States, the European CommunityCommission and the four Airbus partner-countries are scheduled tomeet in Konstanz, West Germany, March 18 to discuss U.S. claimsthat the Europeans unfairly subsidize the consortium.   French Transport Minister Jacques Douffiagues told reportersafter the ministers' meeting that Airbus' mandate is ''unlimited,''although the negotiations would tend to focus more on plannedaircraft than on existing programs.   A cooperation accord with McDonnell could take the form of ajoint venture or co-production scheme, he said.   Douffiagues suggested that possible areas of useful cooperationbetween Airbus and Mcdonnell could include small short-range jetswith between 100-150 seats as well as large aircraft with 350 seatsor more. ''There is no upper limit,'' he said.   ''Any agreement with Mcdonnell must be balanced, taking accountof the advantages and constraints for both sides,'' Douffiaguessaid.   Douffiagues said part of the interest in an agreement is that itwould ease Airbus's access to the U.S. market, where the group hasonly three customers.   A statement released after the meeting said Airbus' mandate isto negotiate ''diligently'' and ''with a will to reaching abalanced agreement that is beneficial to the two parties.''   The industrial partners of the Airbus consortium _ France'sAerospatiale, Britain's Aerospace, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm ofWest Germany and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas _ have hadcontacts with Mcdonnell for almost two years now on eventualcooperation.   Previous talks with McDonnell Douglas on possible cooperationcollapsed in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
