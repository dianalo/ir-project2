Leukemic cells of another AML patient showed HRAS gene activation.By using a rapid and sensitive dot-blot screening procedure based onthe combination of in vitro amplification of RAS-specific sequences andoligonucleotide hybridization they additionally screened 15 myelodysplasticsyndromes, 26 Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelocytic leukemiasin chronic or acute phase, and 19 other chronic myeloproliferative disorders.A mutation within NRAS codon 12 could thus be demonstrated in a patientwith idiopathic myelofibrosis and in another with chronic myelomonocyticleukemia. Moreover, mutated NRAS sequences were detected in lymphocytes,in granulocytes, as well as in monocytes/macrophages of the latter case.</TEXT></DOC>
