There is rubble in every direction. To the left, many of the buildings have been flattened by artillery fire. Bulldozers now are clearing away the debris. To the right are the empty shells of what until February were homes, shops, apartment buildings, offices and mosques. This is how a once-bustling big commercial center looks three months after a revolt by militant Moslems was shelled into submission by government troops. Up to 10,000 residents died in the confrontation, according to diplomatic sources, yet little news of the battle or its aftermath has reached the West.    That was the start of the chilling dispatch filed in 1982 by our Mideast correspondent at the time, David Ignatius, after a rare glimpse of Hama, the city that the Syrian dictator, Hafez al-Assad, destroyed to silence dissent. The population of the Syrian city was reportedly reduced to a sixth of the 300,000 who lived there before the siege. Some estimates put the number who died at 20,000. Yet few seem to remember the fate of the people of Hama.    One group does remember -- the Christian community of Lebanon. Since the days in August when the same Syrian dictator who murdered Hama's thousands began moving forward artillery and tanks to within range of Beirut, the Christians have been fleeing his savage artillery. They know that Assad's army is preparing to do to Lebanon's Christian community what it did to the people of its own city of Hama. It is preparing to commit a massacre -- in which untold thousands of Christians will die. The scale of the looming disaster is defined by the fact that the besieged Christian enclave is home for one million people.    Western reaction has been pitiful. Liberal pundits have gone out of their way to blame the Christians' military commander, General Michel Aoun, for provoking a Syrian assault. It would be like blaming the Americans at Bastogne for the German encirclement. In Washington, State Department spokesmen echo this line -- or feed it. They seem to feel that by being crueler, bloodier and more determined than the next guy, President Assad has earned the right to dictate the fate of Lebanon. The Bush administration's main policy initiative was to helicopter its few diplomats out of America's Beirut embassy after the embassy was besieged by resentful Lebanese Christians, egged on, no doubt, by a frustrated General Aoun.    By now it ought to be clear that in Lebanon disengagement is not a responsible option for America. The Reagan administration tried to disengage in 1982, withdrawing the Marines. Desperate Christian militiamen then moved in and, in search for Palestinian terrorists, massacred hundreds of civilians at Sabra and Chatilla. The U.S. moved in again, but timidly, and its Marines were blown up in their barracks. Secretary Shultz sought to negotiate honorably with Syria and succeeded only in having the Israelis withdrawn, though they had the one force on our side that was a match in that theater for Assad's troops. Given the opprobrium that was heaped on them the last time they rode to the rescue of the Lebanese, it would be surprising to see the Israelis mount a new rescue.    Somehow the West has been content to leave General Aoun's own force of 20,000 soldiers to get their weapons from the Iraqis, who have their own hatred of Syria and, having disengaged with Iran, are searching for openings against Israel. There will be a high political price to pay in the U.S. if the Syrians perpetrate a Hama-style massacre on Lebanon's Christians. Perhaps the State Department is prepared to let this come to pass. It would be preferable for President Bush to take charge of the administration's Lebanon policy before this curtain falls on Beirut. </TEXT></DOC>
