The bodies were handed over Friday by the guerrillas to U.S.officials in Algiers, where the Soviet-armed group has itsheadquarters.   They were then flown to the U.S. Air Force base in Torrejon,Spain, for a forensic examination and will be returned to theirfamilies as soon as the procedure is completed, said a StateDepartment official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The five Americans were working for T andamp; G Aviation of Chandler,Ariz., which was under contract to the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment on a locust-spraying operation over the Sahara Desert.   The Polisario Front, which has been fighting Morocco since 1975for control of the Western Sahara, accepted responsibility for thedowning of the DC-7 aircraft Dec. 10 and the crippling of acompanion plane that landed safely after the attack.   The Polisario apologized for the attack, which occurred overremote desert terrain on the border between Morocco and Mauritania,saying it mistook the planes for Moroccan military reconnaissanceaircraft.   The United States said evidence gathered so far by an FBIinvestigating team had not turned up any reason to doubt thePolisario explanation.   But the State Department official said the team has not been ableto get to the crash site because of concern for safety in the combatzone. The team has interviewed the five survivors of the other planeand examined the damage, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
