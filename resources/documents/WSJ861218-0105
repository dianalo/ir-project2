Industry analysts viewed the proposal as a first step by the agency toward substantial deregulation of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and the regional telephone companies it once owned. But such deregulation is years off and will spark much controversy.    &quot;It may be an opening wedge to deregulate all commercial services,&quot; said Page Montgomery, vice president of Economics andamp; Technology Inc., a Boston consulting company. &quot;But the commission understands how difficult it will be to do this.&quot;    The commission voted 5-0 to seek public comment on a plan to &quot;streamline&quot; regulation of packet switching networks and telecommunications services offered under competitive contracts. Commercial packet switching services divide data transmissions into tiny digital segments and route those segments economically over telephone lines. Both packet switching and telecommunications contracts are used almost exclusively by large businesses.    The FCC currently requires ATandamp;T and the regional companies to file thick pricing documents for these services, including hundreds of pages of underlying analysis. Under the proposal, the telephone companies could forgo the analysis and gain approval for new services in about two weeks compared with three months.    FCC Commissioner Dennis Patrick said this eased regulation may be applied to other telephone services, if they can be shown to be competitive. &quot;We're not precluding a look at the entire interstate services market,&quot; he said.    ATandamp;T said it was pleased by the FCC proposal. &quot;The analysis could ultimately produce streamlined regulation of all ATandamp;T services,&quot; a spokesman said. But Steven Harris, a lobbyist for Pacific Telesis Group, a regional telephone holding company, cautioned that the commission must answer a host of difficult questions before it approves the proposal.    The agency asked for public comment on what services should be deregulated and what safeguards should be required to ensure that telephone companies don't improperly subsidize these services.    The FCC plan comes amid a flurry of telephone deregulation proposals. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce Department agency that handles telecommunications policy, is expected to issue a report in February that calls for scrapping traditional rate-of-return regulation. Under rate-of-return regulation, telephone companies can recover all their expenses plus a percentage of their investment in the telephone system.    Deregulation proposals will draw attention &quot;from Capitol Hill, from competitors and from large customers,&quot; said Harry Shooshan, a Washington telecommunications consultant. &quot;Large customers want the benefit of competition, but the protection of regulation, so they get price discounts, but no price gouging.&quot;    In a recent speech, Mr. Patrick suggested replacing the rate-of-return system with a &quot;social compact.&quot; Under a social compact, the FCC would set price ceilings for telephone services and eliminate most other regulation. Several states have proposed such systems, but the concept is controversial.    &quot;The social compact is no bargain,&quot; said Mr. Montgomery, the Boston consultant. &quot;Real costs of telecommunications are going down. If you cap prices today, you cap at artificially high levels.&quot;    Separately, the agency began a one-year inquiry into the constitutionality of its practice of awarding preferences to women and minorities seeking new broadcast licenses.    In September, in a brief filed in a case appealed from the FCC to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the FCC argued that such preferences are unconstitutional. The court later remanded the case back to the FCC for further consideration. </TEXT></DOC>
