Participants in Jessi, an acronym for Joint EuropeanSubmicron Silicon Project, are considering whether to expelthe British computer maker International Computers Ltd.because of the company's acquisition by Fujitsu Ltd. ofJapan.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, N.V. Philips, the troubled Dutch electronicsgiant, confirmed yesterday that it would pull out of a keyJessi program involving research in advanced memory chips.Philips said it would stop developing one-megabit staticrandom access memories, or SRAMs. That and its decision toreduce participation in Jessi are among the first concretesteps under a cost-cutting program announced by Philips inJuly that involves elimination of 10,000 jobs andrestructuring costs of 2.7 billion guilders ($1.51 billion).The company expects a loss of two billion guilders for 1990.   Officials were adamant that the Philips pullout doesn'tsignal the death of Jessi. &quot;The withdrawal of one of themajor players in one of the larger (Jessi) projects is acause of concern,&quot; said an official at Eureka, the agencyoverseeing Jessi and other research and development programsin 18 West European countries and Turkey. The memory-chipproject accounts for one-fifth of total Jessi spending.   Siemens AG and SGS Thomson, Philips' partners in thememory-chip project, said they will continue joint researchdespite Philips's decision, Jessi officials said. ButPhilips's decision strikes at the very heart of Jessi,because the entire Jessi program started in 1989 as a resultof joint efforts by Philips and Siemens to develop advancedsemiconductors.   Philips played down its move by pointing out that itsinvolvement in the memory chip program accounted for only 7%of total spending planned by all Jessi participants. Itaccounted for about a third of the one billion guilders thatPhilips expected to plow into Jessi research, companyofficials said.   The Dutch company said it remains involved in many otherJessi projects, including logic semiconductors,chip-manufacturing technology, chip materials, computer-aideddesign and chips to be used for high-definition television.   Meanwhile, Jessi's board met yesterday to consider theimplications of Fujitsu buying control of InternationalComputers on the British company's participation in severalJessi projects on computer-aided design. The $4 billion Jessiprogram wasn't created &quot;to support Japanese companies,&quot; saidJessi program coordinator Michael Gruenewald in Munich. &quot;Weprobably will have to come up with a decision (on whether toexpel International Computers) in the very near future,&quot; hesaid.   Jessi's board, which represents the companies involved inthe program, hasn't made a final decision. But it agreed tostudy &quot;the political issue and strategic issue&quot; connectedwith International Computers, said Jessi Office Manager HansMeyer.   International Computers' officials expressed surprise thatJessi was considering ending the company's participation inJessi. Company officials said that a lower Jessi committeeagreed last week to recommend to the board continuedInternational Computers participation.   Fujitsu's agreement in July to acquire an 80% stake inInternational Computers from STC PLC has fueled question atother European Randamp;D programs. International Computers is alsoa major participant in Esprit, a $1.6 billion program of theEuropean Community to finance research in informationtechnology. Mario Pandolfi, the EC Commissioner in charge oftechnology and research, has said that it's up to thecompanies participating in Esprit to decide whether they wantto continue working with International Computers or not.   ---   Bob Hagerty contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
