Emphasis is placed on the economic meritsof the two technologies, and capital related costs, fuel costs, operationand maintenance costs, life expectancy and availability are discussedfor both. Environmental and social implications are taken into accountonly in so far as legislation, security, and other considerations affectthe economics of the technologies. The measures of economic merit usedin the study is the 'levelized busbar cost' over the lifetime of thestation. The paper concludes that the nuclear option is more attractivethan coal even under the restrictive assumption that analysts in theyear 2000 could assume constant prices for coal, coal transport, constructionmaterials, and labour. If it is assumed that costs continued to increaseafter the year 2000 with the same speed as in the past, the nuclear optionwould be even more favourable than the coal alternative. 28 refs., 2figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
