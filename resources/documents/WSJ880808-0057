Most analysts expect strong year-to-year gains through year end.    In the quarter ended June 30, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 487 major corporations soared 103% from the year-earlier period, a Wall Street Journal survey finds. Net income climbed 101%.    The total net income of $43.07 billion was exaggerated by major banks' huge additions to foreign-debt reserves in the 1987 second quarter. But even excluding the 27 banks, which reported a loss-to-profit swing of $14.36 billion, net income of the remaining 460 companies climbed 22% from a year before. Though a big rise, that trailed the 24% first-quarter gain, including the banks, and was far below the 51% surge in last year's fourth period.    &quot;With or without the banks, the growth is still better than the Street expected,&quot; says Melissa R. Brown, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.    In the wake of the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, many economists had expected an economic slowdown or even a recession this year. Instead, the economy, aided by American companies' increased competitiveness against foreign rivals, has been so strong that now the economists' chief worry is inflation.    &quot;The better performance of corporate profits is directly tied to the strength in the economy,&quot; says Lacy H. Hunt, the chief economist of CMandamp;M Group, an investment firm.    The profit gains were spread across a wide range of basic industries, including autos and equipment, chemicals, electrical equipment, forest products, industrial and farm equipment, petroleum and steel. Profits of the long-battered nonferrous-metals companies boomed, and the oil-field services group finally hit black ink. Railroads' operating earnings generally improved, but the group's net income was pushed down by nonrecurring charges at CSX Corp. and Burlington Northern. Textiles gained, mostly because of nonrecurring items or circumstances.    Some service industries, such as airlines and telephone companies, chalked up higher profits. Securities firms rebounded from a weak year-earlier quarter.    However, profits fell at aerospace companies, which flew into bumpy going in defense contracting; at thrift institutions; and at electric utilities. Weak advertising revenues hurt much of the media.    Looking ahead, the 51 economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, now generally expect profits to continue growing not only through this year but also well into 1989, although they predict that the gains will diminish next year.    Jerry L. Jordan, the chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, says companies are going to begin seeing weaker profit margins. &quot;The decline in the dollar had allowed domestic companies to get some price relief,&quot; he says. &quot;If the dollar continues to strengthen, there will be no more help from that source. Moreover, wages and nonwage benefits are rising; so margins will be coming down. But total profits will continue to look good, at least through the second half.&quot;    Stuart Hoffman, the chief economist of PNC Financial Corp. of Pittsburgh, agrees that profits will continue rising this year. So far, he says, &quot;wage increases are mainly a creeping phenomenon. But profits will flatten out next year, with a gain of no more than about 3%.&quot;    Here are the second-quarter profits for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000s have been omitted.    AEROSPACE   Although aerospace companies took fewer write-downs related to Pentagon reforms, revenue growth and profit margins continued to be squeezed in the second quarter. Tighter government quality controls on defense contractors led to a $33 million charge at General Dynamics' submarine division and a $48.6 million provision for resolution of contract disputes at Sundstrand. Restructurings are still affecting some earnings. Fairchild had a $2.5 million gain from sale of discontinued operations and a $3.7 million tax credit; its year-earlier net was aided by $18.7 million of one-time gains and an $8.5 million tax credit. At GenCorp, income from discontinued operations added $1 million to net this year, down from $212 million last year. United Technologies had a $41.4 million pretax gain from the sale of its share in a German venture. General Dynamics had a $20 million benefit from tax-law changes in both the 1987 and 1988 periods, and Northrop, without a big tax benefit, would have earned only $4.5 million. At Rockwell and Lockheed, profits came primarily from lower tax expense. In commercial aerospace, McDonnell Douglas was plagued by delays in delivering planes, while Boeing's orders boomed. Although earnings so far haven't been hurt by the Pentagon influence-peddling investigation, analysts caution that some contractors may be named in shareholder suits or forced to relinquish contracts.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr     %    14 Firms                     1988       1987     Chg    Boeing Co                  160,000    117,000   + 37    Fairchild Inds              10,244     18,780   - 45    GenCorp                     21,000    187,000   - 89    General Dynamics            66,700    125,100   - 47    Grumman Corp                18,766     12,034   + 56    Lockheed Corp              106,000    100,000   +  6    Martin Marietta             81,425     71,581   + 14    McDonnell Doug              70,400     97,100   - 27    Northrop Corp               21,900    -15,400    ...

This, along with lower oil prices, generally increased profits. Among those failing to capitalize on higher fares in the second quarter were Pan Am Corp., the parent of Pan American World Airways, and NWA Inc., Northwest's parent. Both blamed higher expenses for their weak year-toyear comparisons. Texas Air continued to be plagued by labor problems at its loss-ridden Eastern Airlines, and Delta benefited from Eastern's problems, picking up passengers in markets where they compete, such as Atlanta. NWA's results included asset-sale gains of $10.2 million in the latest quarter and $8.6 million a year earlier. UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, reported $20.3 million of income from discontinued non-airline operations in the 1987 quarter. For the industry, higher fares should lead to strong third-quarter profits. Bear Stearns analysts predict a 20% year-over-year gain but warn of price-cutting and lower earnings after that.                              2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr     %    7 Firms                     1988       1987     Chg    AMR Corp                  141,427     92,167   + 53    Delta Air Lines           103,277     58,797   + 76    NWA Inc                    28,384     50,647   - 44    Pan Am Corp                -5,036     10,453    ...

Liz Claiborne, whose second-quarter profit slid 25%, blames excess inventory levels throughout the industry; the company predicts a 10% drop in full-year net income. Oxford Industries' $6 million loss in its fiscal fourth period includes a $2.5 million restructuring charge. Phillips-Van Heusen's profit plunged 60%; in the year-earlier quarter, it had a $1.3 million gain from discontinued operations. Reebok's earnings rise reflects $28 million in sales from Reebok Canada and Ellesse North America, both acquired after 1987. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, expecting that the fall season, with its back-to-school business, should improve retail sales in the third quarter and the rest of the year.                                2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    10 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    Brown Group                   6,212      10,303    - 40    Genesco Inc                  -2,279      -2,897     ...

The industry's previous record was $3.33 billion in the 1984 first quarter. But dazzling profits notwithstanding, the industry hit a few potholes. Profits from domestic operations at Chrysler and Ford fell mainly because of a pricing war fought with costly sales incentives. Chrysler, which touched off the battle in February, says the incentives and higher raw-material and labor costs caused a 24% drop in net income. The No. 3 auto maker hopes to avoid a rerun by reducing incentives and raising prices on 1989 models, which go on sale in the third quarter. Ford's 46% increase in overseas profits masked an 8% decline in the U.S. GM improved its U.S. performance with more realistic production schedules and better sales, but much of its 54% earnings increase still came from international operations and an accounting change. Paccar's net roared ahead by 66% because of stronger demand for its high-end trucks.                              2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    13 Firms                    1988        1987      Chg    Champion Spk Plg            4,800       7,600    - 37    Chrysler Corp             320,400     424,100    - 24    Cummins Engine              1,736      10,268    - 83    Dana Corp                  42,700      40,800    +  5    Echlin                     17,901      12,337    + 45    Ford Motor              1,662,800   1,498,200    + 11    Fruehauf Corp             -10,752     -10,301     ...

Moreover, the big banks had few surprises or one-time accounting items in the 1988 second quarter, although Manufacturers Hanover Corp. reported a $175 million gain on the sale of its consumer-finance subsidiary and Chase Manhattan Corp. had a $70 million gain on the sale of its venture-capital interest in Cain Chemical. According to Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, the money-center banks' profits rose 2.6% from the 1988 first quarter. Excluding those banks, Keefe's index of about 150 institutions showed a 3.1% gain from this year's first quarter and a 13.5% gain from last year's second period. Net interest margins -- the difference between what banks pay and earn on their money -- were generally flat, and domestic loan losses remained stable. Analysts generally expect further solid earnings gains in the third quarter. The main worry: Banks may have to stop recording interest on loans to Argentina. But they are expected to resume doing so on loans to Brazil in the fourth quarter.                              2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    27 Firms                    1988        1987      Chg    Bank of Boston             76,100     -83,700      ...

The beer industry, on the other hand, was flat as demand remained soft. Anheuser-Busch posted a 20% increase in volume of its popular Bud Light brand, but Michelob sales fell. Brown-Forman's earnings were hurt by a $33 million write-down in its flagging California Cooler business. General Cinema's profit soared, mostly because it consolidated $16 million in Christmas-quarter profit from Neiman Marcus stores.

Ideal Basic Industries reported a $9.2 million gain and USG an $8.5 million gain, both from discontinued operations. However, Manville posted a $13.9 million restructuring charge. Although earnings increased at several concerns, analysts attributed the gains largely to robust nonbuilding operations. Building-materials lines have been battered by declines in both residential and commercial construction because of overbuilding in some places and tight land supplies in others. The industry's restructuring, analysts add, also reflects efforts to bolster defenses against unwanted suitors, notably at USG and Owens-Corning Fiberglas. The restructuring and its effects on earnings are expected to continue, partly because construction is likely to remain weak.                              2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    12 Firms                    1988        1987      Chg    Armstrong World            46,200      41,100    + 12    Ideal Basic Inds            8,613       1,622    +431    Lone Star Inds              6,222       8,487    - 27    Manville Corp              33,084      41,128    - 20    Masco Corp                 81,900      65,800    + 24    Norton Co                  26,600      19,200    + 39    Owens-Corning              52,000      19,000    +174    Philips Industries         15,013      14,280    +  5    PPG Industries            133,800     102,400    + 31    Puerto Rican Cem            3,888       2,490    + 56    Slattery Group              2,439        -168     ...

Although analysts had once expected earnings to peak by this time, many now see the boom extending into 1989. Because most new plants on the drawing boards won't open until the early 1990s, operating rates and selling prices are likely to remain high in the current quarter, given continued economic growth, the weak dollar, which strengthens exports, and low oil prices, which keep the lid on prices of petrochemical feedstocks. Demand has been so heavy that some producers themselves are hampered by tight supplies of ethylene and other basic chemicals. Du Pont had a $71 million gain from the sale of an interest in a North Sea oil property and from technology sales; the 1987 quarter included a net gain of $18 million after the sale of a business and several charges. Grace's net included a $6.1 million gain on discontinued operations, and Hanna was aided by $15.7 million in one-time gains and $9.4 million of tax credits. However, Hercules's profit was depressed by higher raw-material costs and heavy aerospace investments; it had a $6.4 million year-earlier gain from the sale of assets. Pennwalt had a $3.4 million charge from settling a lawsuit and was also hurt by lower profits in its pharmaceutical and industrial-equipment businesses.                              2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    22 Firms                    1988        1987      Chg -    Air Pdts andamp; Chem            52,288      40,065     + 31    American Cyanamid          99,500      87,600     + 14    Dow Chemical              624,000     312,000     +100    Du Pont Co                639,000     504,000     + 27    Engelhard Corp             14,133      18,036     - 22    Ethyl Corp                 56,899      47,783     + 19    Goodrich B F Co            60,400      38,300     + 58    Grace W R                  64,368      33,777     + 91    Hanna M A Co               32,144       8,939     +260    Hercules Inc               47,300      67,000     - 29    Int'l Min andamp; Chm            17,300        -400      ...

The notable, though anticipated, exception was SmithKline Beckman, where plunging sales of Tagamet, an ulcer drug, and Dyazide, used to control high blood pressure, contributed to a 25% drop in net. Elsewhere, strong international sales, new products and favorable foreign-exchange rates helped push up earnings. Neil Sweig, a Prudential-Bache analyst, says the biggest surprise was Pfizer, whose profit was &quot;higher than anyone expected.&quot; Much of the gain came, however, from nonoperating earnings. The group's pacesetter was Merck, which benefited from strong sales of Vasotec, used to control hypertension. Squibb's sales jumped 21%, led by Capoten, another antihypertension drug. Analysts expect industry profits to moderate for the rest of the year, especially if the dollar stabilizes.                              2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    16 Firms                    1988        1987      Chg    Abbott Labs               185,284     155,110    + 19    Am Home Pdts              215,822     195,876    + 10    Bristol-Myers             190,484     161,508    + 18    Eli Lilly andamp; Co            180,700     150,300    + 20    Johnson andamp; Johnson         271,000     225,000    + 20    Marion Labs                39,751      28,727    + 38    Merck andamp; Co                316,300     235,100    + 35    Pfizer Inc                213,100     175,800    + 21    Robins A H Co               8,002       7,736    +  3    Rorer Group                11,354      10,879    +  4    Schering-Plough           101,000      82,500    + 22    SmithKline Beckman         98,700     132,100    - 25    Squibb Corp               114,100      95,200    + 20    Syntex                     73,600      62,400    + 18    Upjohn Co                  87,772      78,608    + 12    Warner-Lambert             91,627      80,810    + 13    TOTAL                   2,198,596   1,877,654    + 17   ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT   Most companies continued to post stronger earnings -- a trend expected to continue at least through this year. &quot;Things are generally positive,&quot; says Russell L. Leavitt of Salomon Brothers. But industrial markets are generally stronger than consumer ones, and operations tied to construction or defense are softening a bit. General Electric restated its year-earlier earnings to reflect an accounting change; without that change, its profit would have risen 16% instead of 23%, and GE calls the lower figure &quot;more meaningful.&quot; It still expects a &quot;strong, double-digit&quot; increase for the year. Earnings fell at Maytag, whose refrigerator sales weakened, and Whirlpool, which blamed its kitchen-cabinet business. Honeywell also had lower net because of write-offs in its military-avionics and semiconductor lines. But semiconductor results generally were much stronger than a year ago. Zenith Electronics fell into the red; it cited lower prices for television and video products.                              2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    30 Firms                    1988        1987      Chg    AMP Inc                    84,039      62,510    + 34    Arrow Electronics           6,825         406   +1581    AVX Corp                    7,053       3,835    + 84    Baldor Electric             2,832       1,833    + 55    Cooper Indust              60,425      45,420    + 33    CTS Corp                    3,429       2,483    + 38    Emerson Electric          137,200     119,000    + 15    General Electric          835,000     679,000    + 23    General Instrument         21,364      11,965    + 79    Gould Inc                  62,300       3,500   +1680    Grainger W W               29,060      24,171    + 20    Honeywell Inc              31,600      54,300    - 42    Hubbell Inc                18,803      16,229    + 16    Intel Corp                130,730      46,493    +181    Johnson Controls           24,300      19,100    + 27    Litton Industries          42,038      34,271    + 23    Loral Corp                 19,628      15,639    + 26    M/A-Com Inc                 4,290      -8,850     ...

TOTAL                   2,281,219   1,771,579    + 29   FOOD PRODUCTS   The group's strong showing was largely due to Kraft, where net was ballooned by a $685.6 million gain from sale of its Duracell unit; in addition, acquisitions and cost controls helped lift operating earnings. Ralston Purina's profit rose, aided by lower sales and advertising expenses and a lower tax rate. Kellogg's profit gain was primarily due to higher sales; the cereal giant cited dietary changes that increased its revenue nearly 18%. Gerber posted a 24% gain in baby-food volume from a weak 1987 quarter. Holly Farms benefited from higher chicken prices, reflecting production cutbacks and rising demand. Poultry's comeback also aided ConAgra, although the diversified company's pretax earnings fell 2%; a lower tax rate lifted net income. At Pillsbury, a lower operating profit was masked by a $21.6 million restructuring charge last year; otherwise, Pillsbury's net would have dropped 10% as its consumer-foods and restaurants businesses faltered. General Mills' pretax operating profit slipped 4%, partly because of heavier marketing costs, but a lower tax rate and pension-accounting changes lifted net income. Among companies with lower net, Campbell Soup would have reported an 11% gain in earnings except for early-retirement and plant-closing charges. And CPC International's year-earlier results included a $126 million gain from restructuring.

In addition to the lower dollar, reduced tax rates are helping some companies. Lumber prices jumped almost 20% late in the period, as strikes hit U.S. lumber operations at Willamette and Champion, but prices have subsided as fears over a wider strike ease. At Fort Howard Paper, costs associated with a planned leveraged buy-out and charges connected with its Canadian operations reduced net income by about $5.4 million. In the 1987 second quarter, Champion International's net was bolstered by $92.4 million of pretax gains from sale of investments, Georgia-Pacific posted a $37 million net gain from liquidation of investments, and Federal Paper Board had an $8.2 million charge for debt retirement. Analysts say the pulp and paper industry may be nearing the top of its cycle, but they expect strong earnings gains at least through year-end. Lumber prices seem likely to remain weak over the long term but may be volatile in coming months because of labor negotiations.                              2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    19 Firms                    1988        1987      Chg    Boise Cascade              72,230      35,230    +105    Bowater Inc                40,802      16,752    +144    Champion Int'l            112,193     155,710    - 28    Federal Paper Board        28,847       8,574    +236    Fort Howard                46,912      48,751    -  4    Georgia-Pacific           118,000     148,000    - 20    Great Northern Nekoosa     85,300      44,900    + 90    Int'l Paper               188,000      90,000    +109    James River Cp             59,056      45,817    + 29    Kimberly-Clark            100,100      83,800    + 19    Louisiana-Pacific          39,300      34,800    + 13    Mead Corp                  73,000      51,900    + 41    Potlatch Corp              24,538      22,317    + 10    Scott Paper                75,300      58,800    + 28    Stone Container            78,100      32,500    +140    Union Camp                 74,080      47,812    + 55    Westvaco Corp              45,219      24,299    + 86    Weyerhaeuser Co           150,569      89,183    + 69    Willamette Inds            42,318      27,774    + 52    TOTAL                   1,453,864   1,066,919    + 36   GROCERY CHAINS   With a few exceptions, the industry continued to show stability and modest growth. American Stores' earnings for the period ended April 30 were hurt by its efforts to lift its market share by rolling back prices in some regions. The company said recently that interest costs associated with its $2.51 billion acquisition of Lucky Stores will keep profit &quot;drastically reduced&quot; for the rest of the year. Borman's says its loss narrowed sharply from those of the preceding two quarters and expects &quot;further improvements&quot; in coming periods. Kroger's year-earlier net included a $3.8 million credit. For most companies, the rest of the year promises more of the same steady growth, unless drought-related price increases anticipated in late autumn spark heavy consumer resistance.

But occupancy trends, which had turned up a bit in the first quarter, resumed their slide. Mainly because of lower tax rates, net income climbed, even though margins continued to be squeezed by higher labor costs and only modest increases in Medicare reimbursements. &quot;The magnitude of the gains is misleading,&quot; says Larry Feinberg, a Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst. But he predicts that net income will grow 4% to 6% over the next 12 months. Hospital-supply companies are benefiting from their customers' tendency to consolidate orders. Beverly Enterprises is still suffering from heavy debt and higher labor costs; the nursing-home operator's year-earlier loss included a $15 million pretax charge from the planned sale of a medical-equipment business and $37 million for increased reserves. Hospital Corp.'s latest quarter included a $6 million gain from sales of certain investments and properties, net of write-downs. National Medical was hurt by $22.5 million of losses from discontinued operations, compared with year-earlier losses of $73.2 million from those operations.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    9 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    Amer Medical Intl           33,715      31,650     +  7    Bausch andamp; Lomb               23,638      20,619     + 15    Baxter International        91,000      77,000     + 18    Becton Dickinson            42,949      36,742     + 17    Beverly Enterpr                111     -21,641      ...

Ameron's operating profit soared 59%, but net fell because of a $5.8 million gain from asset sales a year earlier. Foster Wheeler's profit included a $5.5 million gain from an asset sale; last year, it had a $3 million pension-plan gain. Morrison Knudsen's deficit was largely due to a $41 million loss from discontinued operations. Fluor's year-earlier results included a $9.7 million loss from discontinued operations. David F. Bartlett, a Ladenburg Thalmann analyst, is &quot;very bullish&quot; on the group, though he says Blount and Morrison Knudsen, beleaguered by losses in shipbuilding, continue to perform below par. &quot;We're heading into the good years now,&quot; he adds.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    6 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    Ameron Inc                   5,048       9,226    - 45    Blount Inc                      93       2,108    - 96    Dravo Corp                   3,525     -32,702     ...

Kaufman andamp; Broad, based in Los Angeles, benefited from an 18.7% increase in residential closings, nearly two-thirds of which were in California. The company's 104% surge in revenue included a $100 million gain from sale of an office and commercial complex in Paris. Ryland Group's California joint ventures contributed pretax earnings of about $6.7 million -- a sharp increase from a year earlier -- and helped the Columbia, Md., builder overcome slightly lower sales. Centex's 1,509 closings were up 17% from a year earlier, reflecting its October 1987 purchase of John Crosland Co., whose operations are concentrated in the Carolinas and the Washington, D.C., area. Its income from operations increased 23%; net income in the 1987 quarter included a $50.1 million gain from an accounting change. Houston-based U.S. Home's decision to trim operations in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas continued to hurt operating income.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    4 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    Centex                       6,521      55,389    - 88    Kaufmanandamp;BroadHm             11,496       6,365    + 81    Ryland Group                10,680       9,641    + 11    U.S. Home                    1,911       1,511    + 26    TOTAL                       30,608      72,906    - 58   INDUSTRIAL andamp; FARM GEAR   Spurred by the weak dollar, higher demand for machinery and other capital equipment produced another strong quarter, even though profit margins were hurt by the costs of hiring workers and gearing up production schedules. As those costs abate, says John McGinty, a First Boston analyst, &quot;the results will get even better.&quot; One question mark: the drought's effect on farm-equipment sales. Deere, the big farm-equipment maker, says its fiscal second quarter wasn't affected, and it won't project the third-quarter impact. Analysts are cautious. &quot;Clearly the euphoria . . . has been tempered,&quot; PaineWebber's Eli Lustgarten says. At some companies, special accounting items abounded. Trinova's net included a $3.3 million pension-plan gain. AM International's net was after a $1.6 million loss from discontinued operations, while a year earlier it had $1.4 million in income from discontinued operations. Cincinnati Milacron had a $2.4 million tax benefit this year and a $1.7 million gain from a patent settlement last year. Ametek reported a $5.9 million loss from discontinued operations in the just-ended quarter, and a small tax benefit kept National-Standard out of the red.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    13 Firms                     1988        1987      Chg    Allis-Chalmers                 951       1,411    - 33    AM International             1,551      -5,610     ...

Earnings plunged at Aetna, which took a $45.1 million after-tax charge related to its insurance obligations at A.H. Robins, the maker of the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device. Travelers reported operating earnings fell 87% to $15 million. The company said it would add $415 million to reserves for real-estate operations; that reduced second-quarter earnings by $80 million. In the wake of a cyclical slide in property and casualty insurance prices, analysts believe that the industry's earnings will begin to slip. &quot;We were looking for peak earnings in the first and second quarters,&quot; says Herbert E. Goodfriend at Prudential-Bache.

Most of the companies don't yet see a rebound in advertising, which has been hurt at financial publications by the stock-market crash. The second-half outlook is uncertain for broadcasters CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. because of the five-month script-writers' strike, which has delayed the fall TV season and hurt audience ratings. Cap Cities/ABC's 14% rise in net sprang solely from a lower tax rate; operating earnings fell 2% in broadcasting and 20% in publishing. The CBS gain was due mainly to interest income and a lower tax rate. Net rose less than 10% at Dow Jones, Dun andamp; Bradstreet, Gannett, Knight-Ridder, New York Times Co. and Time Inc. and somewhat more at McGraw-Hill and Washington Post Co. Tribune Co.'s net climbed 31% despite soft advertising; its newsprint operations were strong. Chris-Craft Industries' net surged 52% on higher income from its Warner Communications stake and gains from securities sales. But MCA's net plunged 79%; the company blamed an after-tax $35 million charge on losses at its LJN toys unit because of the &quot;Gotcha&quot; gun and also a $12.3 million investment loss.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    17 Firms                     1988        1987      Chg    Cap Cities/ABC             113,886      99,732    + 14    CBS Inc                    128,700      92,100    + 40    Chris-Craft Inds             8,641       5,701    + 52    Dow Jones andamp; Co              49,478      49,115    +  1    Dun andamp; Bradstreet           116,404     112,024    +  4    Gannett Co                  97,526      89,724    +  9    Knight-Ridder               44,998      43,026    +  5    MCA Inc                      8,081      39,345    - 79    McGraw-Hill                 44,826      40,007    + 12    Meredith Corp                6,738       8,360    - 19    N Y Times Co                45,073      44,109    +  2    Time Inc                    84,000      78,000    +  8    Times Mirror Co             78,984      83,001    -  5    Tribune Co                  63,614      48,555    + 31    Walt Disney Co             165,039     128,384    + 29    Warner Commun              127,580     104,323    + 22    Washington Post Co          49,305      42,362    + 16    TOTAL                    1,232,873   1,107,868    + 11   NONFERROUS METALS   The companies generally surged into the black, reflecting an industry boom and major turnarounds at Alcoa and KaiserTech. In the 1987 second quarter, Alcoa was hurt by $165.7 million in one-time charges, including provisions for closing a smelter and writing down fabricating facilities. In the latest period, KaiserTech was helped by a $14.4 million tax benefit; a year earlier, it had a $29 million loss from discontinued operations. The second-half outlook is excellent, with aluminum plants running flat out and several price increases about to take hold. At some other nonferrous-metals companies, results also soared. Amax's net included a $125 million gain from a tax settlement. Eagle-Picher cites start-up costs for new projects as a reason for its modest gain in earnings, which nonetheless set a record. Homestake Mining says its higher profit from gold and base metals was partly offset by an 83% increase in exploration expenses; the year-earlier quarter included a $5.7 million gain from sale of mineral properties. Callahan Mining blames its loss on sharply reduced revenue from its Idaho silver interests plus continued poor results from a Michigan gold mine.

But several medium-sized companies turned in earnings far below expectations, sending their stocks plunging. The mid-range market proved especially perilous, claiming Data General and Tandem Computers as victims of failed expectations -- although Digital Equipment's robust quarter kept analysts from declaring an all-out slump in minicomputers. Compaq's profit was boosted by a $6.4 million special gain from increasing the carrying value of an equity holding. IBM's earnings would have risen 12% without a restructuring charge. Analysts expect a roughly flat third quarter for Big Blue as it gears up to sell new mainframes and mid-range machines.

With fewer companies left, those remaining can increase market share while gaining efficiency from the numerous mergers and joint ventures in the industry. Major oil companies say they will spend more on exploration and development this year than last, but oil-drilling activity onshore in the U.S. is still moribund and offshore drilling, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, has picked up less than anticipated.

Crude prices were down about $2 a barrel from a year earlier, hurting exploration and production earnings, but prices for gasoline and many chemicals shot up because of increased demand. Companies say profit margins in July and early August kept rising; so, profits this quarter should also be strong. Amoco posted special gains, including $186 million from settlements of natural-gas sales disputes, partly offset by $50 million of charges associated with insurance operations. Chevron had $177 million of gains on asset sales, partly offset by $45 million of charges relating to environmental programs and tax adjustments; a year earlier, asset sales and other items increased net by $144 million. Occidental's net included a $10 million loss from early retirement of high-cost debt; year-earlier results were lifted by gains of $98 million from tax benefits and the sale of a unit in Colombia. Texaco had a $301 million gain from sale of its West German unit. Sun had a $297 million loss due to restructuring.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    21 Firms                     1988        1987      Chg    Amerada Hess               -23,460      89,386     ...

Texas Eastern had an $11.6 million gain on sale of its Australian exploration and production properties. Enron posted a $40.3 million gain on sale of half of its cogeneration business and a $9.3 million charge for reacquiring debt. Panhandle Eastern was pushed into the red by a $4 million rate refund, and Transco's net included a $15.8 million charge for settling a lawsuit. Coastal's operating results were lackluster, but lower interest and debt expense pushed up net income. Enron notes that natural-gas prices have firmed recently but concedes that it will continue to be &quot;profit-sensitive&quot; to fluctuating prices for the rest of the year. So will the rest of the industry. The third quarter, like the second, is generally a slow one, although Transco may benefit if the heat wave continues in the Northeast, where it is a major player and many power plants run on natural gas.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    6 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    Coastal Corp                30,600      22,300    + 37    Consol Nat Gas              13,851      15,751    - 12    Enron Corp                  31,200       2,800   +1014    Panhandle Eastn             -1,223      21,062     ...

CSX's rail traffic slid 4%, but, excluding the special charge, its earnings nearly tripled, reflecting a $373 million pretax gain from sale of a rail line in Florida and of an oil and gas unit. The group's operating earnings generally improved. Carloadings rose 6.8%, with grain shipments up 15%, coal 4.1%, metal ores 15% and motor vehicles 13%. Loadings of lumber fell 4.4%. Norfolk Southern posted record earnings, reflecting increased traffic and reduced labor costs. At Conrail, additional freight revenue more than offset higher settlements in casualty litigation. Analysts expect the industry's third-quarter earnings to benefit from strong traffic and higher freight rates.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    8 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    Burlington Nrthn           -41,005      82,090     ...

Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year, has already posted an increase of nearly 11% in merchandise-group profits, helped by strong credit-card operations; the group's pretax profit, however, plunged 20%. Analysts expect K mart, Wal-Mart, F.W. Woolworth, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Nordstrom to report higher earnings in the July quarter than a year earlier. But lower profits are expected at J.C. Penney, May Department Stores and Limited. Losses are likely at Zayre, whose discount stores are still in trouble, and Carter Hawley Hale, which is plagued by markdowns and restructuring debts. K mart is benefiting from a lower tax rate and tighter expense control. Wal-Mart and Nordstrom are gaining market share. May is being hurt by interest expenses associated with its recent acquisition of Foley's and Filene's, two former Federated divisions. Limited, plagued by sluggish sales and markdowns, is a fashion victim. And Penney &quot;is probably the most disappointing of the lot,&quot; says Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel Burnham Lambert, who blames apparel markdowns for his estimate of a 10% to 15% earnings drop.

Year-to-year comparisons were helped by the disastrous bond-market plunge in April 1987, which caused several Wall Street firms to take big bond-trading losses in the 1987 quarter. What's more, some special items helped bolster year-to-year comparisons. Morgan Stanley reported record quarterly profit after a $123.7 million pretax gain from sale of its interest in Cain Chemical. American Express recovered strongly from its year-earlier loss, which in part reflected a $520 million after-tax charge for additions to reserves for credit losses. Most analysts don't expect a strong third quarter. They say trading and commission revenues generally declined in the second quarter from the first. And very large merger deals that can produce big gains for Wall Street seem to be diminishing.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    6 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    American Express           280,800        -600     ...

Avon's profit from continuing operations was flat. Gillette was helped by strong blade and razor operations here and abroad. Colgate's operating profit climbed 25% to $52.3 million, with European operations showing the greatest strength. Looking ahead, Nancy Hall of Smith Barney, Harris Upham says Gillette is likely to be hurt in the short term by debt from its stock buy-back, Colgate should benefit from price increases and Avon should be able to meet its goal of a 10% increase in per-share earnings from continuing operations.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    3 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    Avon Products              -82,400      41,500     ...

The weak dollar, stronger-than-expected economic growth, import quotas and capacity reductions continued to fuel a big upturn in demand, and most observers expect industry shipments to hit 80 million tons this year. Prices have regained the lofty levels reached before the industry's shakeout began in 1982, and thanks to the cost-cutting forced by global competition, a leaner industry is earning far more at those prices. Inland Steel earned a huge $73 per ton shipped on a pretax basis. The $70 per ton earned by USX Corp., an oil company that also is the nation's largest steelmaker, is similarly thought to be a record. Bethlehem Steel's gain was even sharper than the comparison of net income suggests; the company had a $32.5 million investment-tax-credit refund in the 1987 quarter.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    10 Firms                     1988        1987      Chg    Armco Inc                   40,400      36,200    + 12    Bethlehem Steel            150,500      46,800    +222    Carpenter Tech              10,892       2,188    +398    Inland Steel                79,924      17,485    +357    Laclede Steel                4,105       1,248    +229    LTV Corp                   157,600     122,700    + 28    Lukens Inc                   8,563       6,123    + 40    Northwestern Steel andamp; W      10,466       4,961    +111    Nucor                       18,882      13,945    + 35    Wheeling Pitts Stl          62,084      39,321    + 58    TOTAL                      543,416     290,971    + 87   TELEPHONE COMPANIES   Results were mixed, though several companies turned in strong quarters. Analysts expect usage to keep growing but say profit margins may fall unless costs can be curbed further. High overhead costs and expenses were primarily responsible for holding down ATandamp;T's earnings. However, MCI's profit surged because of aggressive cost-containment measures and strong growth in commercial accounts. Its earnings included a $9 million pretax gain on the antitrust settlement with ATandamp;T and a $15 million tax credit. United Telecom benefited from narrower losses from its US Sprint joint venture. Contel had a $43.4 million gain from a stock offering for its cellular division. Most Baby Bells were helped by increases in new telephone lines and in local long-distance usage. Ameritech also posted a $42.1 million gain from sale of its stake in a Canadian cellular company. Weak economies in Texas and Oklahoma hampered Southwestern Bell, and Nynex's nonregulated businesses did poorly. U S West's profit would have dropped about 8% because of rate reductions without an $88.7 million gain from a stock offering for its cellular unit.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    13 Firms                     1988        1987      Chg    American Info Tech         351,500     275,800    + 27    American Tel andamp; Tel         594,000     596,000      0    Bell Atlantic              344,100     326,100    + 6    BellSouth                  395,700     382,300    + 4    Centel Corp                 29,967      35,579    - 16    Contel Corp                104,486      47,376    +121    GTE Corp                   299,449     223,153    + 34    MCI Communic                73,000       8,000    +813    Nynex Corp                 322,800     322,700       0    Pacific Telesis            321,000     264,000    + 22    Southwestern Bell          212,900     248,800    - 14    U S West Inc               336,300     268,800    + 25    United Telecomm             41,038    -118,275     ...

Fieldcrest Cannon posted a 116% surge from the 1987 second quarter, when earnings were depressed by stain-resistant carpet problems. Kay Norwood, an Interstate Securities analyst, says the earlier acquisitions of Cannon Mills and Bigelow Carpet are also starting to pay off. West Point-Pepperell's net doubled, mostly because of a $16.9 million gain on sale of a joint venture. But the company had a $4.5 million operating loss in finished apparel because its spring sports-shirt line flopped.

Several companies posted earnings gains or just modest declines only because year-earlier net was depressed by an industrywide write-off, forced by regulators, of the $824 million secondary reserve of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Despite the lower profits, analysts believe that the quality of earnings is improving because one-time gains on sales of loans and securities represent a smaller portion of earnings at many thrifts. David Hochstim of Shearson Lehman Hutton expects third-quarter earnings to top both the year-earlier and second-quarter levels but, he cautions, &quot;We're not looking for tremendous earnings growth for anybody.&quot; Meritor's second-quarter loss stemmed mostly from $70 million in charges for loan-loss reserves and restructuring costs. The FSLIC write-offs reduced year-earlier net by the largest amounts at Great Western, $27 million; Ahmanson, $12.8 million; and CalFed, $8.9 million. GlenFed's year-earlier net was boosted by a tax benefit of $11.4 million but reduced by an after-tax FSLIC write-off of $5.1 million.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    11 Firms                     1988        1987      Chg    AhmansonHFandamp;Co               48,835      34,362    + 42    CalFed Inc                  39,000      41,400    -  6    Coast Sav andamp; Loan            11,612      10,801    +  8    First Fed Mich              13,064      12,601    +  4    Gibraltar Finl             -10,504       9,272     ...

They were helped by robust sales overseas and the continuing trend of prices rising faster than costs. For the rest of the year, &quot;You are going to see good earnings growth by each of the companies, with Philip Morris being the standout,&quot; says Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber analyst. He predicts that Philip Morris will maintain its 30% growth in earnings per share. Analysts also believe that the verdict in the landmark Cipollone tobacco-liability case won't affect the companies' earnings outlook. Although the plaintiff was awarded $400,000, &quot;Cipollone resulted in a major disincentive for plaintiffs' attorneys because there are no punitive damages to be gained,&quot; Mr. Goldman says.                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    3 Firms                      1988        1987      Chg    American Brands            154,600     107,400    + 44    Philip Morris              627,000     476,000    + 32    RJR Nabisco                354,000     299,000    + 18    TOTAL                    1,135,600     882,400    + 29    UTILITIES                               2nd Qtr     2nd Qtr      %    35 Firms                     1988        1987      Chg    Allegheny Power             37,719      45,481    - 17    Amer Elect Power           118,785     117,326    +  1    Baltimore G andamp; El            43,335      51,657    - 16    Carolina P andamp; L              63,917      60,143    +  6    Centerior Energy            57,565      94,338    - 39    Central andamp; So West           80,000      84,000    -  5    CMS Energy                  52,644      48,292    +  9    Columbia Gas Sys              -208       2,851     ...
