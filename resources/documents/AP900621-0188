MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   They can see it now: campaign commercials,spawned by the flag debate, aimed straight at them.   It begins, said Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., with an opponentsaying the issue is not patriotism but judgment. ``Then comes thegraphic 30-second commercial, featuring an unsavory, beardedlowlife burning a flag, and clearly implying that a particularsenator is less than patriotic because he chose to preserve freedomover a constitutional amendment,'' said Bradley, a runaway favoritefor re-election, nonetheless concerned about the impact of hisdecision to oppose an amendment against flag burning.   ``The 30-second TV spot can cut both ways,'' said Rep. F. JamesSensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis. and one of the leading House supportersof the amendment in Thursday's debate. ``I can see some liberal PRman starting a 30-second spot with the Bill of Rights going up inflames.''   Those political worries, and more like them, underlie the debateabout the flag and the Constitution, and they are arguments theHouse could not settle with its vote Thursday against an amendmentto permit laws against flag burning.   The roll call was 254-177, a majority but 34 short of thetwo-thirds required. But Senate advocates of an amendment alreadyhad vowed to force a vote there _ pointless legislatively, but notpolitically. It takes two-thirds in each house of Congress to senda proposed amendment to the states for ratification.   The speaker of the House, Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., saidthe amendment vote on Thursday would be the last in that branch.``We're not going to go around and around and around and around,''he said.   But the issue has, ever since the Supreme Court ruled just ayear ago that flag burning was permissible under the FirstAmendment to the Constitution. That invalidated 48 state lawsagainst it and ignited the debate; President Bush pushed anamendment, and congressional Democrats passed a law forbidding flagburning instead. The court overturned that this month and theamendment was revived.   The 1990 replay never had quite the emotional impetus of the1989 original, even though a Gallup poll this month showedtwo-thirds of the public in favor of a constitutional ban on flagburning.   Looking at those numbers, Republican campaign strategists figurethey have an issue that will last. Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., theminority whip, said it was not an issue that would go away soon. Hesaid if an amendment isn't sent to the states _ 38 would have toratify _ in 1990, it will come up again next year. That way, hesaid, Republican congressional candidates who favor an amendmentcould demand that their opponents announce positions on aflag-protection amendment in the next session of Congress.   ``I don't think this debate is going to end,'' Gingrich saidThursday, shortly before the amendment was turned down. ``I amconfident that this debate is going to go on for a long time.''   Democratic opponents called Republican tactics the politics offear and intimidation, and said voters will see through it.   But that is more hope than assurance; nobody is certain how theissue will play in the campaign ahead.   That's why the debate has been waged on two levels.   One is about the flag, the court, the Constitution and freedomof speech.   The other, as Bradley said, ``is about pure politics.''   Because it is, wary Democrats provided a fallback, insurancevote, on another measure, this one to ban flag burning intended toincite violence. The court already has overturned one federalstatute, and the outlook for this one would be dubious.   But the bill and a companion measure in the Senate nonethelessgive opponents of the amendment a way to vote for flag protection _a vote they can tell their constituents about.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
