Statistics Canada said energy companies, including oil andgas companies and electric utilities, are expected to accountfor 52% of the total projected 1992 spending of 43.42 billionCanadian dollars (US$38.64 billion) by the 300 majorcompanies surveyed. The 5.1% spending increase isn't adjustedfor potential inflation.</LP><TEXT>   Major energy projects under way include construction of anoil production platform for the Hibernia oil field offCanada's east coast and an expansion of the natural gaspipeline network of TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.   The projected spending increase &quot;is an expression ofconfidence in the economy,&quot; Finance Minister Don Mazankowskitold the House of Commons. The economy is in what appears tobe a shaky recovery from a yearlong recession.   Corporate investors have been encouraged by a decline inCanadian interest rates and by a reduction in the cost ofplant and equipment spending as a result of the replacementJan. 1 of a 13.5% federal sales tax by a 7% value-added tax.Canadian banks cut their prime rates yesterday by a further0.25 percentage point, reducing them to 8.50%, the lowestlevel in more than 13 years. The prime rate is the benchmarkfor various lending rates.   Ernie Stokes, Canadian services director at WEFA GroupLtd., an economic advisory concern, said that despite lowprofits and low capacity-utilization rates, many Canadiancompanies need to make capital investments to replaceworn-out equipment.   Corporate earnings were only 4.4% of gross domesticproduct in the first quarter of this year and 4.7% of GDP inthe second quarter, the lowest levels since statistics werefirst collected in 1947.   Some analysts said they doubt that Canadian business as awhole will increase its capital spending next year by as muchas the 5.1% projected for the 300 large companies.   Earl Sweet, Royal Bank of Canada's assistant chiefeconomist, predicted that many businesses will useimprovements in their cash flow next year to pay off debtrather than invest in new plant and equipment.   Mr. Sweet also said that the weak Canadian recovery hasleft operating levels discouragingly low for many prospectiveinvestors. In April-June, manufacturers operated at only71.3% of capacity. The operating rate has to approach 85%before businesses have a strong incentive to expand, he said.   Alex Carrick, economist with CanaData, a Torontoconstruction research group, said the company's data onproject starts this year indicate that spending on plant andequipment will decline next year.   Separately, another government agency, Canada Mortgage andHousing Corp., forecast that Canadian housing starts willrise 20.4% next year to 183,000 from an estimated 152,000this year.</TEXT></DOC>
