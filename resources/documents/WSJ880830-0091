Under the consent order, Texaco has 30 days to make an initial payment of $400 million, the equivalent of more than half the company's net income in its last profitable year, 1986. The remaining payments will be spread out through 1994.    In February, when the company reached a preliminary agreement, officials said reserves were set aside for the settlement, which would have no impact on current earnings.    The department's agreement with the White Plains, N.Y., integrated energy company mainly settles a dispute over oil prices charged between 1973 and 1981, when federal price controls were in effect. The government estimated its claims could have totaled more than $2.1 billion.    Stock market traders have already taken the settlement into account, analysts said, so Texaco's shares weren't affected by the news. Texaco stock closed at $45.375 a share, down 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Almost every major oil company has made similar settlements involving the period when the price that a company could charge for crude oil depended on whether it was classified as &quot;new&quot; or &quot;old&quot; crude under price decontrol arrangements.    Texaco's payments aren't the highest, though they are a strong second. Exxon Corp. was ordered to pay $2.1 billion. But after Texaco, said an Energy Department spokesman, comes Amoco Corp., which reached two settlements totaling $408 million; Atlantic Richfield Co., which settled for a total of $381 million; and Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., which agreed to pay $180 million.    By some measures, Texaco has shown signs of improved operations lately, replacing more of its reserves in 1987 than in recent years, and aggressively bidding for prime leases off of Alaska. The company's decision to shed at least $5 billion in assets has pleased many of its institutional investors, and, to some degree, its largest shareholder, Carl Icahn.    But the company's progress is difficult to assess because much still hangs over it, even after the Energy Department agreement and a $3 billion settlement payment to Pennzoil Co. &quot;If you want to follow the detailed movement of Texaco on a blow-by-blow basis, it's hard to follow,&quot; said Paul Ting, an analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., New York. &quot;You had the Pennzoil settlement, you still have Icahn,&quot; who launched an unsuccessful effort to gain seats on the board.    Also hanging over Texaco is the Internal Revenue Service, with $6.5 billion of claims covering 1974 to 1986. While Texaco has neither settled with the IRS nor admitted liability, it has agreed to make cash deposits against the claims totaling $1 billion over four years.    Furthermore, Louisiana alleges that Texaco owes the state $387 million, representing unpaid royalties on natural gas produced on state lands from 1970 through 1985. According to the state, that figure can be tripled. </TEXT></DOC>
