In its 1992 forecast, the California Association ofRealtors predicted resales would increase 4% to 437,000 froma projected 420,000 in 1991, ending three consecutive yearsof declines. Although that would be an improvement, the 1992projected sales would still be below the 446,370 resales rungup in 1990, when sales fell sharply from the year before.California resales have been sliding since 1988, when theypeaked at a record 562,000 existing homes sold.</LP><TEXT>   The projected 4% rebound in 1992 sales, moreover, pales bycomparison with California's 46% increase in resales duringthe first year following the last recession in 1981-82. TheCalifornia housing market sank more slowly into recessionthis time than in 1981-82, and consequently will recover moreslowly, said Leslie AppletonYoung, vice president of researchand economics for the state realtors' board.   &quot;We do see {1992} as a turning point, but it clearly is avery moderate turnabout in activity,&quot; Ms. Appleton-Youngsaid, adding that California will lag the national housingrecovery rather than lead it as it normally does.   The realtors' group also forecast that median prices ofsingle-family homes would rise 4% to $206,000 in 1992 from1991's projected median price of $198,000. That rise wouldbarely surpass next year's projected inflation rate of 3.5%,minimizing gains. Condominium resale prices are projected tofare even worse, increasing 3% to a median of $150,000 from$146,000 this year, the realtors' board said.   The once-robust California housing market was hard hit bythe recession that sent both resales and sales of new homestumbling throughout the state. With unemployment persistentlyabove the national level, many economists think it will takeat least until next year for the California housing market toturn around.   The state's realtors are hoping that lower mortgage ratesand improvement in the national economy will provide theboost for the much-anticipated turnaround. A rebound in theeconomy, the group said, would stir the consumer confidenceneeded for a recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
