The decision by the 12 opposition parties in the Lok Sabha, thelawmaking branch of Parliament, was sparked by an auditor's reportciting inconsistencies in the 1986 purchase of $1.4 billion inSwedish artillery guns.   Opposition members and news reports allege officials receivedmillions of dollars in kickbacks in return for securing thecontract for the Swedish company.   The move was not expected to have much effect on Parliamentsince Gandhi's Congress Party commands a majority, but oppositionleaders said they hoped it would call attention to the arms dealand make it a major issue in the next election, due by January.   ``Never before has the office of the prime minister been broughtinto disrepute as under the present incumbent,'' said V.P. Singh,leader of the Janata Dal (People's Party). ``We were all elected bythe people, and now we are going back to them for their verdict onthis issue.''   Government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by Singh,who at that time served as finance minister in Gandhi's Cabinet.Singh left the governing party in 1987.   The 12 opposition parties controlled 106 seats in the 544-memberLok Sabha. Besides the Janata Dal, they include the BharatiyaJanata Party (Indian People's Party), the Telugu Desam (Party ofthe Telugus), the two major Communist parties and other regionalgroups.   The rest of the seats are controlled by Gandhi's Congress Partyand independents.   After the auditor's report was released Tuesday, oppositionmembers in Parliament shouted anti-government slogans, calledGandhi a thief and demanded his resignation. When he refused, theywalked out and stalled proceedings for three days.   The report said the arms purchase was flawed on technicalconsiderations and cost assessment.   The arms purchase has been a major scandal for Gandhi'sgovernment because of allegations the Swedish firm AB Bofors paidkickbacks to secure the contract.   Newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting toat least $50 million were paid to senior government officials andto Congress Party coffers. The allegations have never been proved.   Opposition leaders have previously demanded Gandhi's resignationon the issue, but the 44-year-old prime minister has repeatedlysaid he was not involved in any wrongdoing.   A parliamentary committee that investigated the deal last yearsaid there was no evidence kickbacks or commissions were paid tosecure the sale.   Opposition parties have been using the Bofors issue to try tomerge and mount a viable challenge to Gandhi and the Congress Partyin the general election. Their efforts have stalled in squabblingand widely publicized power struggles for nearly a year.   But N.T. Rama Rao, leader of the Telugu Desam, said the decisionto resign from Parliament proved the opposition could unite onmajor issues.   ``We are committed to give a clean government to the country,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
