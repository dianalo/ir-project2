About 2,000 students from a dozen colleges took part in a rallyat Seoul's Yonsei University to denounce the Olympics and PresidentRoh Tae-woo's government.   Many shouted ``Yankee go home.'' Some burned an effigy of anAmerican wearing the Stars and Stripes.   ``Oppose the Olympics that squeeze out the blood of themasses,'' shouted a radical leader as protesters chanted slogansagainst the Games, scheduled to begin in Seoul Sept. 17.   Police said they had no reports of arrests or injuries. Studentsalso clashed with police at Yonsei Friday in an anti-Olympicprotest.   Students marched out of the school to confront hundreds of riotpolice surrounding the campus in the western part of the city.   Protesters, some armed with iron and wood clubs, taunted policeand then attacked them with firebombs and rocks.   ``Oppose the dictatorial Olympics'' and ``Down with the militarydictatorship,'' protesters chanted.   Waves of masked students rushed out of the school's gates andclimbed over walls to pelt police with firebombs that exploded inorange balls of blazing gasoline, setting fire to some troopers'shields and clothing.   But police did not use tear gas because of a government banduring the Olympics. Police also hurled back fewer rocks thannormal in an apparent attempt to limit violence.   Police charged the protesters a few times, but remained on thedefensive most of the time. The fighting lasted about 30 minutesand was confined to the road in front of the school.   Radical students have called for widespread anti-Olympicprotests, but they have been confined to a few campuses in Seouland some other cities. There have been no demonstrations near theOlympic venues.   Student leaders told a rally before the clash with police thatthe Roh government was using the Olympics to solidify authoritarianrule. The leaders said the Olympics should not be staged unlessthey helped to promote democracy.   ``The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,''said a statement by the protesters. ``The regime is making all-outefforts to weaken the people's power.''   Speakers charged the United States was conspiring with Roh tocontinue military rule. The United States has about 42,000 troopsstationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.   National Assembly Speaker Kim Chae-sun, in a speech Saturday tothe opening session of the legislature's new session, said theoverwhelming majority of South Koreans support the Olympics.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, havevirtually no public support. Most South Koreans are critical ofradical protests against the Olympics and want nothing to disruptthe Games.   Radical students contend the Roh administration is a front forcontinued military rule and say they are determined to topple thegovernment.   Roh, a former general who won a presidential election inDecember, has introduced broad political reforms and dismantledauthoritarian controls.   In another development Saturday, aides to former President ChunDoo-hwan said he canceled plans to attend the opening ceremonies ofthe Olympics. Chun has been accused of corrpution by the opposition.   The aides quoted Chun as saying he did not want to cause troubleat the Games and would stay away despite government plans to invitehim as an honored guest.   Olympic organizers have invited Chun as one of South Korea'sthree living former presidents, and government officials have saidChun's role in bringing the Games to Seoul justified the invitation.   The invitation triggered a strong opposition backlash. Chun, whoseized power with military backing in 1980, has faced aparliamentary inquiry for alleged corruption and other wrongdoingduring his administration.   Chun left office in February after a seven-year term.</TEXT></DOC>
