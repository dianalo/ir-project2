On another issue, Brady repeated the administration's intent toopen talks with Congress on a fiscal budget for 1991 opposing a taxincrease. But, despite prodding by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., hedeclined to categorically rule out the possibility of a tax increase.   ``Certainly the 1990 budget was put togehter with that in mindand that's what happened,'' Brady said. ``We would begin with thatsame process in 1991. The president's position is quite clear andthat obviously is my position.''   In response to questions on the significance of the summit, Bradysaid U.S. inablity to ``come up with its prescribed and agreed-to''contributions to the World Bank and other multinational agencies hasbecome ``a source of embarrassment in worldwide forums.''   Brady made the assessment after the committee's chairman, Rep.Lee Hamiltion, D-Ind., noted that President Bush offered ``a verymodest'' $125 million to encourage fragile democratic and freemarket economic movements in Poland and Hungary.   Cleaning up the environment and relieving the debt burdensdepressing Third World countries were the other two primary topicsof the summit, but Hamilton noted the United States offered no neweconomic help for either.   ``If you look at the areas which seemed to dominate the summit,in all cases, it seems to me, American funds simply were notavailable in large quantity,'' Hamiltion said.   Brady noted that Japan, with a pledge of $65 billion, has assumedthe leadership in sharing the burden of Third World debt reduction.   ``We have to give credit where credit is due,'' he said. ``Theyhave come forth with hard money to support the debt strategy.''   But he complained that other countries with large surpluses _West Germany and Taiwan _ have offered little help.   Brady said he also expects an agreement ``reasonably soon''between private banks and Mexico in the first test of his plan fornudging private banks into forgiving large protions of the $1.3trillion debt owed by developing countries.   Endorsement of his plan by the heads of state of the six otherindustrial powers _ Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada andJapan _ puts more pressure on the banks to negotiate debt-reductionagreementsm, he said.   Several members of Congress have expressed skepticism about theworkability of the plan and its reliance on government-backedguarantees to cover interest payments to the private banks on theremaining balances.   The administration had sought to put some of those fears to rest,hoping to announce at the summit an agreement in which Mexico's 15creditor banks agreed to a 30 percent to 40 percent reduction in the$54 billion they are owed by its government. No announcement wasmade.   ``I wish it were going faster, but these negotiations are verycomplicated and take a long time,'' Brady said Tuesday. ``I thinkwe're going to get resolution reasonably soon.''   ``And when we do get it,'' he said, ``I think everybody will feelrelieved that the first transaction has taken place and other oneswill follow much more quickly because we know how to do it.''   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., questioned whether private banks inother countries were resisting the debt-reduction efforts in thebelief that their governments were not as supportive of Brady's planas the United States.   Brady said the significance of the summit was that the issue hasnow been ``kicked upstairs to the head-of-state level.''   Last April, a month after the plan was revealed, it received aqualified endorsement from the finance ministers of the six otherindustrial powers.</TEXT></DOC>
