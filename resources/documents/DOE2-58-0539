The heat exchanger utilizes a boundary layerof innocuous gas, which is continuously replenished, to protect the heatexchanger surface from the hot contaminated gas. The innocuous gas ispumped through ducts or perforations in the heat exchanger wall. Heatfrom the heat stream is transferred by radiation to the heat exchangerwall. Heat is removed from the outer heat exchanger wall by a heat recoverymedium. 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
