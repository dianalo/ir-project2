In a stern warning, city spokesman Ding Weijun also said foreignreporters may not invite Chinese citizens to their offices,residences or hotels ``for interviews on activities prohibited''under martial law.   Ding's statement, read at a weekly Foreign Ministry briefing,elaborated on martial law regulations banning foreign news coverageof the student-led pro-democracy movement.   The foreign correspondents' club denounced the expanded rules as``censorship and harassment.''   Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing on May 20 in anattempt to crush the pro-democracy movement, which began inmid-April with student marches and class boycotts and hasgalvanized the nation.   Defying martial law, Beijing have prevented troops from enteringthe city and nearly 10,000 students continue their occupation ofTiananmen Square, the symbolic center of power.   Martial law restrictions barring foreign reporters frominterviewing demonstrators have been widely ignored.   Ding said, ``Press coverage in Beijing by foreign journalists orjournalists from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan is subjected to priorapplication'' for approval by the city foreign affairs office.   The broad statement indicated that all news coverage, not onlythat relating to the demonstrations, must be approved first.   Coverage of martial law troops, including taking photos andvideotapes, is banned, and reporting ``in a disguised form'' suchas meeting Chinese participating in the democratic movement inhotels, offices or residences is outlawed.   Journalists were also told they should not ``acquire by unjustmeans'' materials ``of an instigative or agitative nature.''   Ding said the Beijing government reserves the right to interpretthe decrees as it sees fit and that the decrees take precedenceover other existing regulations.   The Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing in a statement saidit ``strongly protests'' the martial law restrictions onjournalists, calling them ``a deplorable case of press censorshipand harassment.''   The statement said the ban on coverage ``calls into questionChina's policy of openness to the outside world'' and urged Beijingauthorities to rescind the regulations.   Beijing-based foreign journalists and hundreds of journalistsfrom outside China covering the popular uprising so far have facedonly isolated obstacles.   Foreign TV crews have had to deal with periods of not beingallowed to transmit by satellite, and some Chinese-languagefrequencies of the U.S.-government-financed Voice of America havebeen jammed.   There has been no official attempt to keep journalists offTiananmen Square or away from student activists.   However, in the past several days at least two U.S. televisionnetwork representatives and a Japanese network were warned bypolice that their crews were violating martial law regulations andtold they were to cease all unauthorized reporting.   A correspondent for the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun was alsosummoned for a warning and today, the British Broadcasting Corp.was also called in by police.   In no case have specific threats been made. Ding also saidnothing specific about penalties, only that violations will bedealt with ``in light of the seriousness of the individual case.''   At dawn today, about 300 People's Liberation Army troops marcheddown Beijing's main avenue near Tiananmen Square, chanting amilitary song.   It was the second straight day that the military had appeared inforce on city streets _ on Wednesday a large convoy of militarymotorcycles with sidecars roared through the capital.   ``I think they were just sent to try and scare us,'' said WangDi, a sophomore from the Beijing Journalism Institute. ``But Idon't think anyone was scared. They didn't come that close and notmany students knew they were there.''   Students have refused to leave the square until the governmentanswers their demands for reforms including a free press and an endto official corruption.   Government hardliners, including Premier Li and senior leaderDeng Xiaoping, have demanded the democracy movement be suppressed.   They reportedly ousted from power Communist Party chief ZhaoZiyang, considered a student sympathizer.   On Wednesday night, students put up tents around their 33-foot``Goddess of Democracy'' to prevent any government attempt toremove it.   The government says the statue, a replica of the Statue ofLiberty, insults the Chinese people and demanded it be removed bytoday. The plastic foam statue of a robed woman holding aloft atorch was unveiled by students Tuesday.   The statue faces the gate to the Forbidden City andrevolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung's portrait.   ``Thursday came and it's still here,'' said a student from WuhanMaritime Industrial Institute. ``Our revolution will endure.''</TEXT></DOC>
