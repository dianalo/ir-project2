The QA monitors are based on data from these committees butalso include data from the information management system, such as patientdelays, contrast reactions, incidents, complications, time-flow analyses,film library retrieval, cancellations, missing reports, and missing clinicaldata. Committee data include complaints, missed diagnoses, patient identificationproblems, and equipment failure. The QA monitors have now been incorporatedinto summary reports as part of their computer networks. A systematicmethod for follow-up ensures corrective action and documentation. Examplesof improved quality of care resulting from this approach includes reductionsin delays for report signature and in repeat films.</TEXT></DOC>
