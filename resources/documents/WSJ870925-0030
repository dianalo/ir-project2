The survey of 1,544 adults conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week -- after Judge Bork's televised testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee -- found that 42% oppose his confirmation, while 34% favor it and 24% aren't sure. Among those who have read or heard &quot;a lot&quot; about Mr. Bork, negative opinion was even stronger: 53% of that group said Mr. Bork shouldn't be confirmed and 38% said he should.    Although President Reagan and his backers hope that Mr. Bork will tilt the high court in a more conservative direction, the poll found little dissatisfaction with the court's current ideological makeup. About half of those polled said the court is currently &quot;just about right,&quot; while one in five said it is too conservative and another one in five regarded it as too liberal. Similarly, 43% said they want the court to remain about the same in the future, while 27% wanted it to become more conservative and 21% wanted it to be more liberal.    Mr. Bork's promise to exercise &quot;judicial restraint&quot; apparently hasn't swayed public opinion as much as the bitter criticism of his nomination from civil rights, feminist and liberal groups. While 25% of those polled said they agree with Bork backers &quot;who say he believes in judicial restraint and interprets laws in the way intended by elected officials,&quot; 38% sided with &quot;opponents who say he takes a narrow view that threatens freedom of speech, privacy and other rights of individuals.&quot;    Thirty-nine percent of those polled agreed with the statement that Mr. Bork &quot;is too conservative to be an effective member of the Supreme Court,&quot; while 34% agreed that &quot;his conservative views will be an important addition to the court.&quot;    Not surprisingly, Judge Bork draws his strongest support among self-described conservatives: 57% of them said they support his confirmation. But, more surprisingly, one in four conservatives opposed the nomination. Moderates opposed the nomination by 49% to 29%, while liberals opposed it by 61% to 21%.    About a third of Americans said they have heard or read a lot about the nomination, a third have heard or read some, and a third knew little about it.    Most voters said they don't regard the issue as a political litmus test for their senators. Almost two-thirds say it wouldn't affect their vote in Senate races; 19% said they would be less likely to vote for a senator who helped confirm Mr. Bork, while 11% said they would be more likely to support such a lawmaker.    The national poll also found that President Reagan's job approval ratings still haven't rebounded from the Iran-Contra scandal. Forty-seven percent said Mr. Reagan is doing a good or excellent job as president, while 51% said his performance is only fair or poor; those figures have changed little all year. And the boost that Lt. Col. Oliver North's testimony gave the president's Contra-aid policy proved fleeting: 48% said they oppose the policy while 37% favored it. In July, after Col. North's congressional appearance, the policy was opposed by 43% and favored by 40%.    But nearly six in 10 Americans supported the president's policy of having the U.S. military protect Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attacks. The support increased between Monday and Tuesday as word spread of the U.S. attack on an Iranian ship that was laying mines in the Persian Gulf.    The survey also found that most people continue to resist, by a 59%-32% margin, the suggestion that their income taxes be raised to ease the federal budget deficit.    Of those polled, 42% cited foreign competition as the biggest threat to economic growth. But they were evenly divided on legislation that would limit imports from countries that sell more goods in the U.S. than they buy from this country, if those new limits would increase the prices of goods most families buy.    As Alan Greenspan settles in as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, 44% of the public thinks the Fed's top priority should be to keep the dollar from falling further, while 24% say it should be to keep interest rates low and 20% say it should be to keep inflation down, the poll found.    ---   'Do you think the Senate should confirm President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, or don't you think so?'
