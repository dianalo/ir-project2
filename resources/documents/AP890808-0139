(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Columbia rejoined NASA's fleet ofactive space shuttles Tuesday, blasting into orbit with fiveastronauts to put a 10-ton spy satellite on a path over the SovietUnion, China and the Middle East.   Columbia, the oldest shuttle, had been grounded for 3{ yearswhile it was stripped and overhauled from its toilet system to itsouter skin. Its performance during the countdown and at liftoff wasas troublefree as any of the previous 29 shuttle flights.   ``As good as new,'' said Bob Sieck, the launch director. ``It'sgoing to be a gem of a vehicle.''   The Air Force, which booked the entire five-day flight from thecivilian space agency, said nothing about the cargo in theshuttle's 60-foot-long hold. Neither did NASA, which shut down itspublic announcement network, except for periodic ``all's well''reports.   By custom, shuttle crews launch satellites as early in theflight as possible to have the mission accomplished should theyneed to return home early. If that practice was followed on thismission, the satellite would have been released about seven hoursafter liftoff, or about 4 p.m. EDT.   There was no word, however, from NASA or the Air Force.   The mission is expected to end Sunday with a landing at EdwardsAir Force Base in California about 10:30 a.m. EDT.   The shuttle's path, almost perpendicular from its seaside launchpad, was a confirmation of pre-launch reports that it would travelon a north-northeast course instead of heading eastward.   The resulting high-latitude orbit takes it over Poland, theSoviet Union, Mongolia, China, and parts of the Middle East notnormally covered by eastward-bound shuttles. The satellite isdesigned to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements,military installations and other targets of interest.   Sources close to the program said the satellite can make smalladjustments to its orbit, a flexibility that would enable it torespond to changing conditions on the ground.   The cargo bay reportedly holds a package of scientificinstruments for military research, possibly for the ``Star Wars''missile defense project.   Columbia, a veteran of seven flights, ended its last mission inJanuary 1986, 10 days before the Challenger exploded with a loss ofseven lives.   ``Any time a vehicle is down for a long period of time it's alittle worrisome,'' said J.R. Thompson, deputy administrator of theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``There were reallyno problems of any significance. The weather was good to us.''   Columbia's return restored the shuttle fleet to three ships.Atlantis is scheduled next for launch on Oct. 12, carrying theGalileo probe to Jupiter, and Discovery is scheduled for anothermilitary mission in November. A replacement for Challenger, theEndeavour, is to join the fleet in 1992.   Mission control said Columbia's trajectory was ``right down themiddle of the pike,'' _ a perfect path. The two booster rocketsfloated down on parachutes into the Atlantic Ocean, within sight ofrecovery ships. Launch was 8:37 a.m., delayed about 40 minutes byground fog.   Not a word was heard publicly from the five astronauts, who arecommanded by Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran of two earliershuttle flights, including a 1983 trip on Columbia. The other crewmembers are Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Navy Cmdr. David Leestma,Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark Brown.   ``We had a completely clean and smooth ascent. There are noproblems whatsoever to report,'' said launch commentator BrianWelch. And then a news blackout began. Silence will be broken onlyif there is a major problem, NASA said. Crew conversation will notbe broadcast.   The mission is the fifth shuttle flight since launches resumedlast September after a 2{-year hiatus prompted by the Challengerdisaster.   After the accident, NASA concentrated on modifying the newerorbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, pirating parts from Columbia.Discovery and Atlantis each have made two trips into space sincepost-Challenger flights resumed.   During the flight, the astronauts were to check out the safetymodifications made to Columbia, among the 258 changes that weremade.   ``I think the recovery process is over,'' said ForrestMcCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center. ``We've modifiedall three birds, we've flown all three birds now, and that'ssomething we can be proud of.''</TEXT></DOC>
