The major goal of the legislation was to facilitate alternativesto standard liability insurance for small businesses, non-profit organizations,local governments, and professionals whose insurance costs have skyrocketedover the past few years. Many of these entities are too small to self-insure,and state regulations often limit or eliminate other pooling options.Recognizing this problem, Congress acted to make easier the formationof risk retention groups - that is, self-insurance pools for organizationswith similar liability risks. This paper summarizes and explains theprovisions of the newly enacted LRRA. The first section describes thecharacteristics of risk retention groups (RRGs) under federal law: whocan be part of such groups and what activities can such groups carryout. The next section outlines the state regulations and laws that arepreempted by the Act and those that are still permitted. Finally, thepaper discusses a number of questions relating to the organization ofRRGs for certain entities such as municipalities and pollution generators.It also discusses the provisions of the LRRA that deal with so-calledpurchasing groups.</TEXT></DOC>
