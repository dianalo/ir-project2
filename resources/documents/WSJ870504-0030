His department, after all, sends out press releases, lobbies, takes calls from journalists, and communicates with shareholders and investment analysts.    These functions until last year were handled by a staff of 31 people. Now, Mr. Oelman, who formerly headed the company's government-relations staff in Washington, has only one associate and two secretaries.    How does he handle the work? &quot;Half of it you don't do, and the other half you get help for,&quot; he says. But now that help comes from down the street, not down the hall.    When a company that has always relied on its own people begins to rely so much on outsiders, corporate life changes. Owens-Corning, like many other companies, had long employed public-relations agencies and law firms for special projects. But by and large, the company took pride on its ability to handle its own jobs from beginning to end.    Six employee newsletters each had a professional editor, with staff photographers available. An inside video-production studio made employee communication and promotional films.    But that all changed last year with Wickes Cos.' hostile takeover bid. Owens-Corning managers faced a hard choice: cut costs drastically and get the stock price up, or be taken over.    Some tasks disappeared. A monthly videotape for employees was scrapped, and daily press clippings were no longer collected for senior executives. Technology has helped fill the void. With a new electronic-mail system, internal news releases are prepared and sent to employees in a half-hour, compared with the several days it took to produce each newsletter.    By the time the dust settled and the raiders were repulsed, Owens-Corning employees learned that &quot;restructuring&quot; is more than a catchword. The company had cut operating costs in half and, by selling businesses, it cut revenue by 30%. In the businesses that remained, one out of five employees was let go.    Some of the missing have since returned by the side door. A Washington staffer who lost his job in the cutbacks now helps, on a per-diem basis, prepare testimony for company executives called on to speak before congressional committees. A former public-relations manager and a video producer make Owens-Corning videotapes in the company studio they bought. A former marketing manager now works for a trade group that Mr. Oelman intends to use for lobbying work the company itself formerly did.    Meanwhile, Owens-Corning has roughly doubled the amount of work it gives to Kekst andamp; Co., a New York financial public-relations firm, to about $1 million a year from $500,000. Owens-Corning will also step up its reliance on a direct-mail firm that counsels the company on political-action committees.    Riding herd on all the outsiders often casts Mr. Oelman in the role of traffic cop. On one recent day, while preparing for company testimony before a congressional committee, Mr. Oelman found he also had to consult on a television reporter's request to visit an Owens-Corning plant in Tennessee and on the trade group's problems in scheduling a Washington meeting. Kekst, meanwhile, wrestled with the annual report. &quot;Before, one individual had full-time responsibility for the annual report,&quot; Mr. Oelman says. &quot;Now, we simply don't have that.&quot; So he keeps on top of it as well.    Mr. Oelman says he values the different perspectives that all the outsiders bring to his area. &quot;Because they don't work for the company, they can give advice we don't want to hear,&quot; he says.    But some jobs simply can't be done by outsiders. A recent magazine article demanded a lot of Mr. Oelman's time because the writer's many questions about the company's history required an insider's institutional memory.    Nor can he always get the same level of service from outsiders that he can from his own employees. Told that the trade group hasn't arranged the meeting he was counting on, Mr. Oelman explodes in irritation. &quot;I don't have time to fool around with a bunch of amateurs,&quot; he says.    He can't delegate work as freely as in the past, for lack of people to delegate it to. Some of his day is spent on vice presidential work, such as meeting with the company's chairman for an hour and a half to plan testimony. But much of the day is devoted to less exalted chores, such as soothing a contractor who complains of unfair treatment and helping a student with a school project.    Worse, when Mr. Oelman hits the road now, there isn't anyone to backstop him at the office. On a recent trip, he says, &quot;I spent $10 in quarters just returning all the calls that came in while I was gone.&quot;    Nonetheless, Mr. Oelman has become a key man. Although his pay didn't increase when he moved from Washington to take his job in Toledo, his stature within the company did. Today, he is one of a group of executives classed as &quot;equity partners,&quot; entitled to stock options.    It is part of Owens-Corning's effort to compensate managers directly for their contributions to the company. Says Mr. Oelman, &quot;They want me to act like an owner.&quot;    ---                   Use of Contractors Grows            (Jobs per constant dollar of revenue)                               1983      1986      1990*   Executives, Managers,   Supervisors                22.0      20.0      18.1   Professionals               8.2       7.1       6.1   Technicians                 2.4       2.1       2.0   Sales                       7.7       6.7       6.3   Administrative             34.7       29.9     26.0   Contractors                 5.0        8.6     13.0   Hourly                     20.0       17.4     14.9   Total Employment          100.0       91.8     86.4   NOTE: Figures based on survey of 375 large North Americancompanies   *Projected   Source: A.T.
