In the suit filed in Cook County, Ill., court, Edward Bullock, a 30-year employee of the New York-based telecommunications giant, alleges that his boss, Elaine Kaup, repeatedly referred to him as an old man and &quot;dog meat&quot; in salary and performance reviews last spring. Mr. Bullock was a district staff marketing manager in Chicago.    After hearing such statements, the suit says, Mr. Bullock analyzed ATandamp;T's job reduction plans, using company information, and determined that the company discriminated against older employees in awarding bonuses and salary increases and in its job-cut plans. The suit says Mr. Bullock was fired April 24 when he refused to reveal the sources of his information.    In New York, an ATandamp;T spokesman said the company hasn't yet reviewed Mr. Bullock's suit but &quot;as a general matter, ATandamp;T doesn't discriminate on the basis of age or anything else. And that is the truth.&quot;    Mr. Bullock's suit asks for damages to compensate him for lost wages, bonuses, health insurance and retirement, health and pension benefits. The suit asks for $10 million in punitive damages and says Mr. Bullock suffered &quot;grief, mental stress and suffering&quot; because he was fired &quot;maliciously,&quot; with the intention of &quot;coercing him into complying with his employer's improper requests.&quot;    ATandamp;T has cut tens of thousands of jobs since it divested its local phone companies nearly four years ago. Employee morale has been low and some employees have grumbled that cuts have been arbitrary. </TEXT></DOC>
