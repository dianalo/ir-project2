Led by Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D. Colo.), 12 Democrats onthe House Judiciary Committee requested Friday that Mr.Thornburgh appoint an impartial investigator to look intoSilverado Banking, Savings andamp; Loan Association. Rep. EdwardFeighan of Ohio later withdrew his support, calling it an&quot;error,&quot; leaving the Democrats short of the support needed torequest an independent prosecutor. Such a request requires amajority of the Democrats on the committee.</LP><TEXT>   Neil Bush is already facing an administrative hearing inSeptember for his role as a director of Silverado. While adirector, he failed to disclose his business associationswith two major Silverado borrowers who later defaulted onloans. One of those men, Denver developer Kenneth Good, alsoloaned Neil Bush $100,000, which he never was asked to repay.   Mr. Thornburgh said that even if Democrats secure thenecessary support, it's unlikely he would name an independentcounsel because the Justice Department doesn't investigatecivil matters. &quot;I am not aware of any evidence or anyallegation from a credible source that Neil Bush hasparticipated in any criminal activity,&quot; he said on ABC News's&quot;This Week&quot; yesterday.   But Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have alleged thepotential for criminal conduct at Silverado. Moreover, theysaid at least the appearance of a political conflict ofinterest exists. One Silverado borrower and bondholder, LarryMizel, raised $1 million for Republican candidates in 1984.   &quot;The case has criminal implications that should beaggressively investigated, but the potential for political,financial, and personal conflicts of interest . . . raiseserious questions about the Department's ability to conduct afair and vigorous investigation,&quot; said a letter to Mr.Thornburgh from the committee Democrats.   Sandamp;L losses have been piling up for a decade, but headinginto this fall's congressional elections, both parties aretrying to capitalize on the scandal. Democrats have zeroed inon Neil Bush's woes with federal regulators, whileRepublicans have pointed to large campaign contributions toDemocrats from Charles Keating, who sought to have senatorsintervene on behalf of Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association.The president is feeling the heat, particularly from his ownparty, resulting from his backtracking on his no-new-taxespledge, a reversal necessitated partly by the Sandamp;L losses.   Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the National RepublicanCongressional Committee, said that Neil Bush earlier shouldhave agreed to sign a consent order with federal regulators,ending the matter. &quot;I think obviously he should have done it,but Neil Bush think's he's innocent,&quot; he said on NBC News's&quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday.   Under the administrative hearing proceedings for NeilBush, he faces punishment no worse than an admonishment notto engage in similar actions again. Earlier this year, fiveother Silverado directors signed consent agreements underwhich they agreed not to work in the banking or Sandamp;Lindustries again. Federal regulators also are considering a$200 million civil suit against Silverado directors,including Mr. Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
