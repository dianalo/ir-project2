DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Medicare patients and college students areamong those who will take a financial hit because the White Houseand Congress don't agree on how to cut the federal budget deficit,officials say.   The automatic federal spending cuts _ which took effect Tuesdayin place of a budget agreement _ will have substantial effectselsewhere in the government if the reductions stand. However, mostagencies report it would take a while for the cuts to trickle downeven if efforts to resolve the impasse fail.   ``Other than general restraint on spending, nothing's on hold,''a Commerce Department official said Tuesday, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   The Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law orders spending cutstotaling $16.1 billion in the 1990 fiscal year that began on Oct. 1.   ``We are waiting to see what Congress does,'' said spokesmanPete Williams of the Defense Department, which was hit with halfthe reductions.   Labor Department spokesman Tracy Dennison said the department isstudying ways to trim $465 million ``but it will probably besometime down the road before we can say exactly what we'll bedoing.''   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater raised theprospect that President Bush might not accept legislation restoringthe money to the budget.   ``There is some feeling here that they are the way to go,'' hetold reporters. ``It will reduce spending in a very effectivefashion.''   House and Senate leaders, meanwhile, looked for a way out of thedilemma.   The Senate has passed a deficit-reduction bill with almostnothing else attached to it. But the House version includes a hordeof controversial provisions ranging from child care assistance tothe Fairness Doctrine in broadcasting.   If Congress and Bush fail to agree soon, federal employees andmany taxpayers would feel the effects of the cuts.   For example, the Labor Department would delay employee transfersunless absolutely necessary and some new programs could bepostponed.   The Internal Revenue Service, the FBI and other agencies withpersonnel-oriented budgets would have to furlough workers becausethe deficit-reduction law prohibits cutting employee salaries.   ``As a practical matter ... we probably don't have to considerthat for 30 to 45 days,'' said Pentagon spokesman Williams.   At the Department of Health and Human Services, Dennis Williams,deputy assistant secretary for budget, said the most immediateeffect of the cuts will be on Medicare.   ``For everybody else, it will be a cumulative impact overtime,'' Williams said.   Doctors and hospitals that participate in the Medicare programwill see a reduction of 2.092 percent in their payments, he said.In addition, some people who submit their bills directly toMedicare will have to cover the 2.092 percent themselves.   Medicare is taking a total $1.7 billion cut, while defensespending accounted for a $8.1 billion reduction.   Medicaid payments to states are exempt from the budget cuts, asare Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and Aid toFamilies with Dependent Children.   Sally Christensen, director of Budget Service for the EducationDepartment, said the student loan program is the only educationprogram immediately affected by the budget cuts.   The law raises the loan origination fee from 5 percent to 5.5percent and cuts the special allowance payment to lendinginstitutions from 3.25 percent to 3 percent, Ms. Christensen said.With these changes, banks will make less of a profit and studentswill pay more for taking out a loan.   Dennis Kaplan, chief of budget control and analysis for theAgriculture Department, said it is widely believed there thatCongress will soon work out a budget agreement to replace theautomatic cuts.   If not, he said, the Food Safety and Inspection Service ``willprobably furlough a lot of their employees, but that won't occuruntil August or September'' of next year.   The same would be true of the Forest Service and Farmers HomeAdministration, he said.   Much of the Agriculture Department's spending is exempt from thecuts, including food stamps, school lunches and other childnutrition programs.   At the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees 16,800air traffic controllers, spokesman John Leyden said there would beno immediate impact other than pulling back on hirings,procurements and changes of status for personnel.   The White House Office of Management and Budget said a prolongedimpasse might force the layoff of air traffic controllers for threedays a month and a reduction in military forces by 160,000.</TEXT></DOC>
