A spokesman for the aerospace company said he couldprovide no details on the agreement, which apparently wasreached with the help of a federal mediator. Union officalscouldn't immediately be reached.</LP><TEXT>   The old labor contract, which expired March 24, has beenextended on a day-to-day basis, and the UAW had agreed not tostrike. The pact covers about 23,000 workers at four locals,the largest of which is in Long Beach.   Separately, McDonnell Douglas announced a revised MD-11airliner production plan, which allows for a more gradualincrease in the number of jets built in the near term, beforestepping up to a higher rate over a five-year period.   The new schedule, the company said, better &quot;accommodatescustomers and fluctuations in the market, with productionhighest in the mid-1990s, when greater market demand isforecast.&quot; McDonnell Douglas added that &quot;a gradual rateincrease is more cost-effective&quot; in terms of inventorybuildup; it will permit the company and its suppliers to&quot;focus more attention on process quality and cost reduction.&quot;   The new schedule provides for 36 MD-11 deliveries in l991,45 next year, 50 in 1993, 61 in 1994, and 62 during 1995.This schedule represents an increase in production from 0.5aircraft a week now, to about 1.25 a week by 1994. Theprevious plan called for a more rapid early increase ofproduction.   The new plan delivers a total of 254 of the big tri-jetsbetween the start of 1991 and the end of 1995, 10 more thanwere previously scheduled over the same span. McDonnellDouglas has commitments for 377 MD-11s, of which 172 areundelivered firm orders. To date, seven MD-11s have beendelivered.</TEXT></DOC>
