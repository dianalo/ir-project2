There is only one problem: Many consulting firms aren't biting.    Interpublic Group of Cos. says it is looking for consulting acquisitions. Ogilvy Group Inc.'s board recently set up a task group to examine the field. Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC last fall hired top Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. executive Victor E. Millar to head its consulting arm -- and promptly announced its plans to become the largest consulting organization in the world.    &quot;I think a lot of other agencies&quot; are looking at consulting firms, adds William E. Phillips, Ogilvy chairman and chief executive officer. The agencies would love to snap up glamorous management consultants like Boston Consulting Group or Bain andamp; Co., but they aren't ruling out other types. Saatchi says it wants to become the premier consultant in all nine areas it has identified, including marketing and sales, human resources, and technology.    Ad agencies are drawn by consulting firms' potential for double-digit percentage growth -- something the agencies haven't produced for the past three years. Eugene P. Beard, executive vice president of Interpublic, an ad agency holding company, says consulting firms typically have pre-tax profit margins in the 18% to 20% range, while those of most ad agencies range from 10% to 12%. Moreover, while consulting industry revenue has been growing more than 15% a year, U.S. ad revenue grew just 7.8% in 1986 and is projected to grow only 7.2% this year, according to McCann-Erickson Inc., an Interpublic agency.    Furthermore, when agency executives look at consulting firms, they see in their clients scores of potential ad clients there for the picking. &quot;We would like to think that a consulting capability could have some leverage on our other services,&quot; says Ogilvy's Mr. Phillips. Consultants and ad agencies, adds Saatchi's Mr. Millar, &quot;have exactly the same clients in many cases. We think that is the foundation for the match.&quot;    But to many consultants, the idea of some kind of synergy between them and an ad agency is ludicrous, if not insulting. Consultants pay employees well, with those in senior posts typically getting upwards of $200,000 a year. Public companies like Saatchi and Interpublic probably couldn't match such rich compensation.    And then there is the issue of cultural differences. &quot;Consultants include actuaries, lawyers and professionals in other fields,&quot; says J. Perham Stanley, president of Wyatt Co., an employee benefits consulting concern that turned down a Saatchi overture. &quot;I believe they wouldn't look kindly on being subservient to an advertising firm.&quot;    &quot;Advertising and consulting don't share a common link,&quot; contends James H. Kennedy, publisher of Fitzwilliam, N.H.-based Consultants News, a monthly newsletter on the industry. &quot;I've heard from a handful of the big ones (consulting firms) and some of the smaller ones that 'Saatchi approached us, and we weren't interested.'&quot; The only consulting acquisitions that make sense, he contends, would be those involved in related fields such as market research or marketing consulting.    Spokesmen for Bain and for McKinsey andamp; Co., another management consulting firm, also said their firms aren't interested in being acquired. Robert Hayes, a vice president at the Cresap, McCormick andamp; Paget unit of Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; Crosby Inc., a private consulting group, agrees: &quot;I think it's a dumb idea. This cross-selling of services -- an ad agency selling consulting services -- it just can't work. To sell a service, you've got to really understand a service.&quot;    Similarly, Interpublic has had talks with four consulting firms since the winter, says Mr. Beard, the executive vice president, and several rejected the idea of being purchased, adding that &quot;if they were to be acquired, I think you'd be paying a sizable premium.&quot; Philip H. Geier Jr., Interpublic chairman, chief executive and president, says, &quot;We haven't found anything that really makes sense yet&quot; in terms of fitting in with its existing businesses.    Interpublic hasn't given up, however. Within the next five years, it hopes to derive about 20% of its revenue from consulting and other marketing and communications areas aside from advertising, Mr. Beard says. It is looking for small but growing firms that can fill a niche, such as benefits or pension fund consulting.    At Saatchi, executives remain confident of their ability to conquer the consulting field. But some industry executives are skeptical, saying Saatchi appears to have fallen short of its aspirations so far. For example, Mr. Millar, the Saatchi consulting arm chairman and chief executive, said late last year that he would spearhead an aggressive acquisition campaign and that he would &quot;be disappointed&quot; without an acquisition in the 1987 first half. Yet Saatchi acquired only small Cleveland Consulting Associates, for $2 million plus possible future payments tied to performance, in March. &quot;Everyone was surprised,&quot; says Mr. Kennedy of Consultants News. &quot;It's very small except for the price they paid for it.&quot;    Mr. Millar is undaunted. &quot;I am very optimistic, much more even than six months ago,&quot; he says. &quot;At any one time, a number of organizations (are) approaching us with the idea of affiliating with us.&quot;    But Interpublic's Mr. Beard is more cautious about the prospects. &quot;It's going to take a lot more time than people think,&quot; he says. &quot;It isn't like buying an advertising agency. It's a whole new approach.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
