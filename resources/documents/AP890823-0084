Also today, the Education Commission replaced the president ofBeijing University, whose students helped lead the movement that wascrushed in June.   In another development, Anna Chennault, head of the RepublicanHeritage Council, met with Vice President Wang Zhen. She said shewould report back to President Bush but declined comment on reportsshe brought a message from him. Bush said today he had not asked herto convey a messsage to the Chinese.   Politburo member Song Ping said ideological deviations within the47 million-member party were ``quite severe'' and called for a purgeof party leaders with ``bourgeois liberal,'' or Western, leanings,the official People's Daily reported.   Song, head of the Communist Party's Organization Department,spoke on the opening day of a four-day meeting of the department,which oversees discipline within the party. The meeting endedTuesday.   Party corruption was a major theme of the pro-democracy protests,and authorities have combined their suppression of the protestmovement with attacks on corrupt practices within the party.   The China Daily quoted Xu Qing, deputy minister of supervision,as saying the government is investigating 20 major corruption casesand that several high-ranking officials were involved.   Xu said results of the investigations will be reported about thetime of the 40th anniversary of Communist rule on Oct. 1.   The People's Daily quoted Song as saying corruption within partyranks was the main reason ``a small group of thugs could deceive andinstigate the people.'' He said such wrongdoings had ``killed theconfidence the people had in the party.''   Song also condemned party members who supported student demandsfor democratic reforms.   ``A small number of party members from several major researchinstitutes played a disgusting role by running around on sinistererrands and stirring up trouble,'' the official Xinhua News Agencyquoted Song as saying.   Song said the party must stand behind the decisions made in Juneduring a Central Committee meeting at which reformist Zhao Ziyangwas ousted as party chief for expressing sympathy for the protesters.   The Communist Party periodically launches campaigns againstcorruption, but in the past has had little success in reducing theinfluence peddling, extortion, bribery, hoarding of goods andillegal use of public funds rampant among middle- and lower-levelparty and government officials.   Beijing University leader Ding Shisun was the second universitypresident replaced since the protests. The official Xinhua portrayedthe move as non-political and said the 62-year-old Ding had asked asearly as February to leave for ``health and other reasons.''   However, school officials within the past month said repeatedlythat Ding had no plans to leave. When contacted by telephone asrecently as Monday, they said Ding remained president and made nomention of a planned change.   Ding was replaced with 56-year-old Wu Shuqing. Wu had been vicepresident of People's University, whose students also took part inthe protests.   Students from Beijing University, considered China's mostprestigious school, took the lead in the protests as theytraditionally have in past political movements.   Ding maintained a low profile during the protests, speaking outonly to urge a speedy solution to the problem. But he also didnothing to stop his students, while other schools put heavy pressureon their students to stop protesting and some even locked theircampus gates before major marches.   Xinhua claimed that Mrs. Chennault today told Wang that themilitary crackdown on the pro-democracy movement was China'sinternal affair and no foreign country should interefere.   Mrs. Chennault, contacted by telephone, laughed when the Xinhuadispatch was read to her. However, she declined to say if it wasaccurate.   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed civilians were killedwhen troops swept across the city on June 3-4. Bush and many otherforeign leaders condemned Chinese authorities for the crackdown.   Mrs. Chennault, widow of World War II ``Flying Tiger'' founderGen. Claire Lee Channault, arrived in Beijing on Thursday.   She was tight-lipped about her visit, saying only that she had``met important people'' and had ``constructive discussion'' withleaders.   Asked about her visit, Bush today told reporters in Maine, wherehe is vacationing: ``I did not ask her to convey any message to theChinese. We have our own diplomatic avenues through which to dothat.''</TEXT></DOC>
