Although the proposal would repeal the 1933 Glass-SteagallAct that separates banks and brokerage firms, it proposes aseries of restrictions that would sharply limit dealingsbetween affiliated banks and brokerage firms.</LP><TEXT>   What's more, the committee draft would roll back powersthat the Federal Reserve Board has recently given severaldozen bank holding companies, including J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., tounderwrite and sell securities. It also would scale back bankincursions into the insurance business and limit the powerssome state banks have to sell or manage real estate.   The proposal reflects the opposition of Rep. John Dingell(D., Mich.) to financial concentration. Mr. Dingell heads thecommittee, which has strong ties to the securities industry.Although Wall Street is split on the banking bill, some ofthe securities industry's most powerful firms have beenlobbying hard to keep banks out of their business.   The proposal triggered an angry reaction from theTreasury. The department issued a statement calling thecommittee draft &quot;a clear rollback of current law&quot; and saidthe proposal includes &quot;anticompetitive provisions, which willmake financial services companies even less competitive thanthey are today.&quot; Just last week, Treasury UndersecretaryRobert Glauber said that the administration would oppose abill that reverses recent regulatory decisions to allow banksto broaden their services by competing more directly withbrokerage and insurance companies.   While the bill would allow banks and securities firms tocombine, it would prevent banks from financing manyactivities of brokerage affiliates and quarantine banks frompurchasing securities underwritten by their affiliates. Thebill would prevent banks and brokerage firms in the sameholding company from offering a full range of services tocorporate customers; a bank's ability to lend to a companythat uses the holding company's broker to underwritesecurities also would be limited.   &quot;This bill takes the banking industry back in time,&quot; saidSamuel Baptista, president of the Financial Services Council,a group of major banks, brokerage and insurance companiesthat want greater financial integration. Although the billwould tear down barriers barring the affiliation of banks andbrokerage firms, &quot;I'm not sure that anybody would want to owna bank,&quot; Mr. Baptista said. He said the bill calls forrestrictions -- known as firewalls -- on dealings betweenaffiliated banks and brokerage firms that &quot;appear to beoutrageous.&quot; In addition, the bill wouldn't allow brokeragefirms owned by Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., American Express Co. andother integrated companies to affiliate with banks becausethe proposal maintains current prohibitions against thecombination of banks and commercial companies.   The banking industry will strongly oppose the proposal,which began to circulate as leaders of the American BankersAssociation were meeting in Washington to plot legislativestrategy.   The Energy and Commerce Committee could emerge as aspoiler in the administration's effort to achieve a broadbanking bill. Both the House and Senate banking committeeshave approved proposals that would build the shrinking bankdeposit insurance fund, bar government reimbursement ofdeposits above $100,000 when banks fail, significantlytighten bank regulation, allow banks to branch nationwide,and enable banks and brokerage firms to combine in newfinancial services holding companies.   After getting approval by the banking committee, the Housebill went to the Energy and Commerce Committee, which hasjurisdiction of legislation that deals with the securitiesindustry. Next week, the panel's Telecommunications andSecurities Subcommittee will start considering amendments tothe proposal. The full committee will start working on thebill during the week of Sept. 23 in an effort to completework by Sept. 27, a deadline imposed by House Speaker ThomasFoley (D., Wash.).</TEXT></DOC>
