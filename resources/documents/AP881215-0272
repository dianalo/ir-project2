The Bundesbank raised the Lombard lending rate to 5.5 percentfrom 5 percent effective Friday, but it kept the discount rateunchanged at 3.5 percent.   The Lombard rate is what the central bank charges on loans tocommercial banks when securities are used as collateral. Thediscount rate is the main commercial bank loan.   Bundesbank officials said the change in the Lombard rate came inresponse to concerns about rising inflation.   ``We are in an environment of slightly rising interest rates,''said Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl.   He said the economy is in a process ``which one can call aboom,'' and that a tighter monetary policy is appropriate.   Poehl also referred to interest rate developments in the UnitedStates, Great Britain and other European countries. But he stressedthat the Lombard rate hike should not be seen as a concertedinterest rate increase.</TEXT></DOC>
