The study's authors say smokers were three times more likely thannon-smokers to have angina, or chest pains, and painless periods ofinadequate blood flow to the heart.   An editorial accompanying the research in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association said the study was the long-sought``smoking gun'' showing a link between smoking and heart ailments.   Gary Miller, a spokesman for the tobacco industry'sWashington-based Tobacco Institute, disputed that, saying, ``This isnot really enough evidence to make such a claim.''   Miller noted the study involved only two dozen smokers. Forty-onenon-smokers also participated.   The study, based at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, wasconducted by attaching a monitor to patients' hearts. The patients,all of whom had been diagnosed as having heart disease, wore themonitors for 24 hours while they went about their daily routines.   In tests from October 1984 to December 1987, the monitors showed975 ischemic episodes, or periods of inadequate blood flow, 8percent of which were accompanied by chest pains, the report said.The median number of episodes over 24 hours was three for smokers,one for non-smokers.   Dr. Andrew Selwyn, a co-author of the report and a HarvardMedical School associate professor, said ischemic episodes damagethe heart temporarily and can lead to heart attacks.   But the short-term effects are ``reversible and very treatable,''the cardiologist said. ``That's what makes it useful to show (thestudy) to patients and say `Look, you haven't damaged your heartyet, so stop smoking now,''' he said.   ``This is a solid piece of evidence you can show patients beforethey actually have a heart attack,'' Selwyn said. ``I hope it'sammunition that doctors use to show patients as often as possible.''   The Tobacco Institute spokesman, however, said ``anything cancause these ischemic episodes. Caffeine, excitement can cause them.''   The study showed that the episodes lasted longer among smokers,whose median episode lasted 24 minutes compared with 2 minutes fornon-smokers.   Both frequency and duration increased as the number of cigarettesincreased, the study said.   ``The more they smoke in general, the more ischemia they have andthe greater their risk of heart attack and death,'' Selwyn said.   The accompanying editorial said research on smoking and heartdisease until now has been based on indirect evidence.   What had been lacking was direct evidence, a ``smoking gun''linking the two, wrote Dr. Peter F. Cohn of the Health SciencesCenter of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.</TEXT></DOC>
