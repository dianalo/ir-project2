TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UTILITIES (UTI)ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A majority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission showed support for a proposal to encourage states to use competitive bidding in building new sources of electric power.    Though no decision has been made, the support suggests that the commission could propose a rule this year providing new competition for utilities in meeting energy needs.    The bidding concept lies at the heart of a host of changes under consideration by the commission in an attempt to introduce more competition into the electric utility business. It would be a significant departure from U.S. tradition, in which states allow monopoly utilities to build capacity as they deem necessary, and then recover their costs in rates set by regulators.    While specifics haven't been ironed out, the proposal might encourage states to require utilities planning to expand capacity to consider bids from industrial cogenerators, independently-owned generating companies and other utilities. State authorities themselves could also invite bids directly from such alternate suppliers.    While several states, led by Massachusetts, are now experimenting with such bidding systems, some commissioners hope to encourage others to try it.    In testimony before the House Energy and Power subcommittee yesterday, three of the five commission members favored Chairwoman Martha Hesse's proposal on competitive bidding. It was the first public exchange on the issue since Mrs. Hesse proposed the initiative June 10. She said yesterday she hopes the commission can propose rules on this and related regulatory reforms by the end of 1987.    However, the proposal faces opposition both within and outside the commission. Commissioner Charles Trabandt vigorously dissented from the bidding proposal, saying the panel doesn't have enough information to anticipate its effects. He charged that the commission risks &quot;flying blind into the regulatory future.&quot; Anthony Sousa was somewhat critical, while commissioners Charles Stalon and C.M. Naeve supported the idea.    State regulators and the electric utility industry also are divided over the bidding concept. Some critics, for example, say it shouldn't be attempted without first requiring utilities to give all bidders equal access to utilities' transmission lines. And some cogenerators worry that bidding would be used to screen out less efficient power producers.    Supporters claim that bidding systems could help ensure construction of needed generating capacity while keeping rates down. Currently, many utilities are leery of building major plants because demand growth has become harder to predict and state regulators have barred some utilities from recovering their full investment in nuclear plants that were judged imprudent. The bidding process could enable utilities to augment their power supplies without running those risks. </TEXT></DOC>
