The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan lastmonth, highlights possible abuses of group health plans.People in the insurance industry say concerns over invalidgroup membership enrollment have been rising as more and morepeople seek alternatives to more expensive individualcoverage.</LP><TEXT>   In its suit, State Mutual, Worcester, Mass., accusedRetail Local 906, New York, of misleading the insurer aboutits membership. The suit alleged that the union signed upthousands of people as &quot;associated members&quot; who weren'temployed in the retail industry represented by the union butwho qualified for the lower group-insurance rates solely bypaying the $12 monthly dues. The suit said the associatedmembers received no other benefits from the union.   Richard Lutz, an attorney for State Mutual with the firmTownley andamp; Updike, said the associated members included &quot;allsorts of people who would seem to have no connection to aretail local,&quot; such as lawyers, dentists, brokers andunemployed people.   But the union maintains it was doing nothing unusual inallowing associated members to participate in the grouphealth plan. And it disputes State Mutual's claim that thevast majority of the 7,000 to 8,000 people in the planweren't actually represented by the union in collectivebargaining agreements.   Nemiah Soanes, the local's president, said the problemwith State Mutual arose when the union signed up about 3,000associated members through Greater Northeast Business GroupInc. in New York's Brooklyn borough. He said GreaterNortheast failed to provide State Mutual with informationthat the insurer had requested.   The suit also names Greater Northeast, its owner, SolomonSprei, and others associated with Mr. Sprei as defendants.The suit accuses Mr. Sprei and the others of signing up theassociated members in return for millions of dollars infinder's fees and other payments from the union. The suitalleges that Mr. Sprei used forged documents about theunion's membership and previous insurance policies topersuade State Mutual to provide coverage.   Mr. Sprei couldn't be reached for comment.   The union local also has been sued by Empire BlueCross/Blue Shield in a related case over membershipenrollment. State Mutual said it took over the group coveragefrom Empire last May but that the union misrepresentedinformation about its membership.   The State Mutual suit said the union's &quot;open-ended&quot;membership arrangement resulted in a riskier insurance group.Mr. Lutz said the arrangement attracted many individuals withpre-existing medical conditions who otherwise would have beenineligible for individual coverage or would have had to paymuch higher premiums.   &quot;A genuine group of union employees covered by acollective bargaining agreement in an industry provides aform of protection to the insurer, since a measure ofhomogeneity of risk is provided by the specific employmentrelationship,&quot; the suit said. &quot;A group of wholly unrelatedpersons doesn't qualify for group insurance coverage underState Mutual's underwriting guidelines.&quot;   The suit asks that State Mutual be allowed to back out ofthe insurance contract and to not pay more than 18,000allegedly invalid claims that are estimated to total morethan $10 million. Mr. Lutz said the union apparently hasalready obtained other health insurance.   ---   INSURANCE CLAIM allowed for suicide based on &quot;irresistibleimpulse.&quot;   A federal judge in Spokane, Wash., ruled that a man'sself-inflicted death wasn't suicide in the legal sense,because the man was moved by an emotional urge that hecouldn't resist.   In 1989, Horace Richardson, a wealthy Spokane automobiledealer, put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. The actthat ended his life came after a long and difficultconvalescence from an automobile accident two months earlier.   New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. refused to pay a$2.5 million death claim on Mr. Richardson's policy, citing aprovision that denies coverage in the event of suicide. Suchterms are commonly applicable during the first year or twoafter a life insurance policy's issue date.   Judge William Fremming Nielsen's decision in the case,which was brought by the trustee for the Richardson estate,relied upon a handful of rulings in cases involving peoplewho harmed themselves soon after suffering brain injuriesinflicted by others.   The lawyer for the estate, Eugene Annis of Spokane, arguedthat Mr. Richardson was &quot;never the same person&quot; after the carcrash, which left him with amnesia and some confusion.   A spokeswoman for New England Mutual said the companyhadn't seen the decision yet, didn't know all the facts andcouldn't comment yet.   (Rice vs. New England Mutual Life, U.S. district court,Spokane, No. CS90150 WFN)   ---   RIGHT TO DIE upheld for retarded woman in vegetativestate.   Massachusetts' highest court, in a 4-3 decision, backed aprobate court ruling that feeding tubes should be removedfrom the 33-year-old woman. The woman's preferences areunknown because she has been mentally retarded since infancy.   The woman, identified only as Jane Doe, suffers from adegenerative illness of the brain. According to caretakers,she displays no awareness of her surroundings and apparentlydoesn't feel pain. Her parents, a guardian and statephysicians want treatment stopped.   A lawyer for the woman, Jonathan Brant, said he didn'tknow if he was going to appeal the ruling. Before the court,he had argued that the state needed &quot;clear and convincingevidence of the patient's own wishes&quot; before it coulddisconnect her, based on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision inthe Nancy Cruzan case. There, the top court upheld Missouri's&quot;clear-and-convincing&quot; test.   But the Massachusetts court ruled that the test onlyapplies to Missouri, not to Massachusetts. The woman shouldbe allowed to &quot;go in peace,&quot; the court wrote.   In a strongly worded dissent, Justice Francis P. O'Connor,joined by Justice Neil L. Lynch, called the majority'sdecision &quot;legal embrace of suicide -- and beyond.&quot; JusticeJoseph R. Nolan dissented separately, saying the court wasplaying God.   (Guardianship of Jane Doe, Massachusetts Supreme JudicialCourt, N5637)   ---   LAWYER GETS STIFF PRISON TERM in theft of client funds.   Steven Romer, who was convicted last month in state courtin Manhattan, was sentenced to at least 7 1/2 years in prisonbefore becoming eligible for parole. Under the sentence, Mr.Romer, 55 years old, faces a maximum sentence of 22 1/2years.   State court Justice John A.K. Bradley also ordered Mr.Romer to pay restitution of $7 million to the four clientswhom Mr. Romer was convicted of cheating. The four victimsincluded an orphan who lost her entire $740,000 inheritanceand a businessman who lost two multimillion-dollar trusts heset up for his children. Mr. Romer was accused of spendingthe money on himself, his family and his business ventures.   Mr. Romer, who defended himself at trial, maintains he isinnocent.   Mr. Romer -- and his clients' money -- disappeared inDecember 1990. Mr. Romer sent his clients a letter claimingthat he was dying of a brain tumor and that they would bereimbursed by his life insurance policy. In February, Mr.Romer turned himself in to the district attorney and claimedhe had been kidnapped. He has been in custody since then.   ---   NOTED: Panama, as expected, challenged a proposed pleaagreement in the federal criminal case against the Bank ofCredit andamp; Commerce International, saying it first wantsrestitution from the failed bank.
