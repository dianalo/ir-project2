The four-million-gallon tank spewed more than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the Monongohela and Ohio rivers, disrupting water supply to thousands of residents in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.    OSHA said it seeks $30,000 from the Ashland, Ky.-based oil refiner for failing to weld properly the steel plates forming the tank wall and failing to repair defective welds after they were discovered. A $1,000 penalty was proposed because OSHA contends the dike surrounding the tank was inadequate to contain the oil.    The agency also seeks an $800 penalty because it claims Ashland failed to establish a plan for responding to such an emergency and to have a written safety plan for the terminal.    Ashland said it is reviewing the OSHA citations and weighing its options, which include formally contesting the civil charges. The company already contested citations issued Jan. 28 for $18,000 concerning alleged violations during the river cleanup.    Last week, Ashland settled a civil suit brought by the Justice Department, agreeing to reimburse the federal government $680,000 for costs incurred to help clean up the massive spill. </TEXT></DOC>
