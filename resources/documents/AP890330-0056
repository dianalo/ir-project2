One report reaching Kabul said government troops and tanks cameunder heavy fire Wednesday along the Salang Highway about 45 milesnorth of the city. Kabul itself has been generally quiet.   In Pakistan, the guerrillas claimed to have captured a militarypost west of Jalalabad, effectively blocking the road between thatcity and Kabul. They also claimed to have killed at least 147government troops in fighting this week.   A foreign official in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity,said an Afghan civilian reported ``serious fighting'' and destroyedtanks along the Salang Highway, north of Kabul. There was no wordon casualties.   Government troops a few miles outside Kabul have been firingrockets west and northwest of the city since Tuesday. The number oflong-range Scud-B missiles fired from Kabul toward Jalalabad alsohas increased.   Western reporters and foreign residents of the capital countedat least 13 fired Wednesday, and at least four more were launchedin a 10-minute period early today.   The Soviet-supplied missiles can easily reach Jalalabad, 75miles away.   The U.S.-backed guerrillas began their attack on Jalalabad onMarch 6. It was their first major offensive against governmentforces since Soviet troops completed their withdrawal Feb. 15,ending nine years of direct combat support for the Kabul government.   Jalalabad's fall would be a major blow to the morale of thegovernment and a big boost to the rebels. Western observers havepredicted a domino effect, ending with Kabul.   Evidence of guerrilla activity near Kabul also surfaced when aU.N. convoy carrying seeds and fertilizer was caught in cross-firefor about six hours Sunday just beyond Kabul's northwesternoutskirts.   A U.N. official said the shooting began when guerrillas openedfire on people distributing seeds. He said the U.N workers were nothurt.   The government says its troops are still in control ofJalalabad. According to its casualty reports, the guerrillas havesuffered about 10 times more fatalities than government troops.   Claims by both sides tend to be exaggerated and cannot usuallybe confirmed.   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said 147 government troopswere killed this week. It said at least 114 were killed or woundedsince Tuesday around Jalalabad.   The agency also said guerrilla commanders rejected AfghanPresident Najib's appeal for them to give up their war in exchangefor local autonomy. Najib made the appeal Tuesday.   ``If Najib wants to stop the bloodshed, this is the bestopportunity for him to quit (his) office and recognize the interimIslamic government,'' the agency said.   Also today, an explosion blew out the windows of a four-storybuilding in the heart of Kabul's commercial district.   An official of the government press office said the blast wascaused by a bomb ``planted by the extremists'' and that two peoplewere injured.   But a policeman at the scene, who did not give his name, toldforeign journalists a canister of gas used for cooking or heatingblew up.</TEXT></DOC>
