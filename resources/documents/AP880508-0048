Lt. Col. Wieslaw Gornicki, Polish government political adviser,denied news reports and U.S. government allegations of violenceagainst striking workers at a Krakow steel mill and accused thenews media of exaggerating and inflaming conditions in Poland.   ``The strike was crushed, but nobody was beaten,'' Gornicki saidin an interview from Warsaw on ABC-TV's ``This Week with DavidBrinkley.''   ``If it all were true what your news media is reporting, wewould have a general strike, a nationwide strike of 10 days orperhaps three months,'' Gornicki said. At least five strikes haveoccurred in Poland in the past two weeks, including one at theLenin shipyard where negotiations were continuing between workersand management.   Asked about the reported use of percussion grenades to quell theKrakow strike, which had lasted 10 days, Gornicki said he did notbelieve the devices were used but added, ``I cannot rule it out.''   Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead condemned thereported violence Saturday and announced that U.S. backing forPoland's economic recovery program would remain frozen until theprogram wins popular support. The White House twice last week alsoissued statements condemning the government's reported use of forceagainst strikes backed by the outlawed Solidarity labor movement.   Gornicki did not directly respond to the official U.S.criticism. But he said, ``You know, a country which not long agohad a certain experience with its air traffic controllers union ...should make a clear-cut difference between a strike which is legal... and wildcat strikes, which as you know very well are illegal.''   President Reagan fired striking air traffic controllers afterwhat the government said was an illegal strike in 1981.   Gornicki said strikes represent problems with adaptation to``the new style of our economic life.''   U.S. officials, including Vice President George Bush during avisit to Poland last September, had applauded Polish steps towardeconomic reform prior to the current unrest. In March, a U.S.ambassador, John R. Davis, was posted in Warsaw for the first timein five years.</TEXT></DOC>
