The 1/e time scale of these ''refractive scintillations'' canbe many years. The intensity structure function D{sub 1}(tau) = andless;[I:t)-I(T+tau)]{sup 2}andgt; has been computed for various distributions of thedensity fluctuations in the interstellar medium. The results show thatthe intensity fluctuations observed for periods much small than the 1/etime scale are dominated by the region near the earth. Thus most observationsactually sample only the local region.</TEXT></DOC>
