<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-0042 </DOCNO><TEXT>The TNO Institute of Applied Physics (TPD) conducted a monitoring programon the Groningen solar energy system, which consists of 96 solar houseswith a central heat store in the soil. The actual monitoring of the systemstarted on February 1, 1985, and lasted until January 31, 1987. The monitoringactivities were reported periodically to the CEC (Commission of the EuropeanCommunities) in five progress reports, which have been collected in thisreport. Each report gives information about the activities over a certainperiod (September 15, 1984-January 31, 1987), the measuring results overthat period and the planning of the activities for the next period. Thetwo years monitoring results will be presented in a final report (TNO-TPD-403.346,entitled 'Monitoring of the Groningen solar energy system with seasonalheat storage in the soil. Final report'). The monitoring program is mentto measure the total heat consumption (space heating and domestic hotwater) and the total heat gain by the solar collectors of each blockof houses (9 blocks). Of 6 houses in one block the heat consumption forspace heating and domestic hot water are measured separately. At theboiler house the total heat consumption for the group of houses, thetotal heat gain by the collectors, the heat supply to the storage system,the heat withdrawal from the storage system and the heat supply by thegas boiler are measured.</TEXT></DOC>
