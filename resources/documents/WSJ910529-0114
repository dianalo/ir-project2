The plan will remove most U.S. ground troops from the mostwar-ready fighting category and will be followed with furthermajor changes in NATO's command structure and the way nuclearweapons are deployed in Europe.</LP><TEXT>   According to Tom King, defense minister for the UnitedKingdom, the new strategy is needed to cope with threats onthe borders of Europe using forces that are 22% smaller thanthe 2.8 million-person NATO air, land, and naval units nowstationed in Europe.   A new &quot;Rapid Reaction Corps&quot; is being tailored to respondto trouble spots within the first week of a crisis. It willcontain two British divisions and two multinationaldivisions, comprising mainly German, Italian, Dutch, Belgian,and other European forces. Informal estimates of the size ofthis unit have ranged around 70,000 troops, but Mr. King andother officials emphasized that the eventual size and exactcomposition of the force will require more detailed study.   The U.S. will provide tactical air power and airlift andsealift for the corps, allowing it, according to a U.S.official, to respond much more quickly to crises on theperimeter of NATO territory, such as in Turkey and Norway,the only two members of the 15-nation military alliance thatwill have Soviet forces on their borders after 1994.   The changes, Mr. King and other NATO officials cautioned,assume that the Soviet Union and its former Warsaw Pactallies will have withdrawn more than one million troops fromthe European theater by 1994, when the last Soviet forces aresupposed to leave Eastern Europe.   &quot;Every member country of NATO will also have lowerforces,&quot; said Mr. King, emphasizing that crisis managementand rapid mobility will help compensate in a crisis for thelower numbers of troops.   Most of the roughly 100,000 U.S. troops that will remainin Europe and U.S.-based divisions that can rapidly move toEurope will be in a separate and much larger entity calledthe &quot;Main Force,&quot; which will take weeks to deploy.   Because of the dissolution of former Warsaw Pact alliesand the removal of the Soviet army from a wartime footing,NATO planners believe they will have more warning of an enemymove and thus more time to mobilize their units.   The final NATO segment to be dispatched to a crisis areaare called &quot;Augmentational Forces,&quot; and they will be composedof reserve and National Guard units that will be drawn fromthe U.S. and other NATO nations over a period of many weeks.   Planning for the new configuration of NATO, one of themost significant changes in the alliance's 42-year history,will remain imprecise for a while because, as Mr. King noted,the armies of some member nations are shrinking faster thanothers, and some nations, such as the U.K., needed an overallNATO strategic framework to start planning for their futuremilitary needs.   Future changes, including a major overhaul of the NATOcommand structure, currently headed by Americans, and areduction of nuclear forces in the European theater thatwould shift remaining weapons from land to air- and sea-baseddelivery systems, are under way, according to a U.S. seniordefense official, who asked not to be named.   Although there has been much talk about how the changingNATO structure would respond to an out-of-area crisis, suchas the war in the Persian Gulf, NATO defense ministersdevoted most of their attention here to how the force wouldwork within the NATO area, leaving discussions for dealingwith more distant crises for the future.   &quot;This was an interim report. The ministers verified it andthe consensus was to keep going,&quot; added the U.S. official.</TEXT></DOC>
