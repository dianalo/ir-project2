The valuesare used for the calculation of thermodynamic properties in liquid state.A satisfactory agreement of the calculation results with experimentalsdata is obtained. The method to analyze the results of experimental studuesof temperature coefficients of metal density, for which experimentaldata differ considerably is suggested. Using the calculated values ofthermodynamic properties analysis of the reliability of data on temperaturecoefficient of rare earth metal density is carried out and correspondingrecommendations are obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
