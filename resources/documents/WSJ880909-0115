Officials of Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and one of the world's most aggressive oil explorers, denied that the decision stemmed from the latest plunge in oil prices. Instead, said Jack Little, executive vice president, exploration and production, Shell is diverting some of its enormous cash flow to another high-stakes drilling venture in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska.    &quot;We've kind of made a mid-course correction,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a geographical shift from one province to another.&quot;    But Mr. Little acknowledged that the absence of the big oil-price gains of the past was forcing Shell to curtail risks. &quot;We sometimes have opportunities we have to put on the shelf,&quot; he said.    Indeed, the number of drilling rigs at work in U.S. fields is down 15% this week from a year ago. &quot;Drilling is being curtailed because of weak oil prices,&quot; said Ike Kerridge, a vice president and economist at Baker Hughes Inc., an oil-service concern. &quot;People are saying that 'If the price dips below $15 (a barrel), we're just not going to drill.' &quot;   Most major oil companies based 1988 capital spending budgets on forecasts that prices would be volatile -- but in a range of $15 to $18 a barrel. Shell and other companies say their spending is on course, unaffected by short-term price declines.    &quot;This is the volatility one expects,&quot; said Ted Eck, chief economist for Amoco Corp., Chicago. While he said that commodity traders are certainly nervous, particularly because of the uncertain outcome of a scheduled November meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, &quot;I don't think the people who have been in this industry a long time are all that nervous.&quot;    &quot;We're not getting any panic calls,&quot; said Thomas Manning, vice president of Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc., a Houston consulting firm that works for many of the major oil companies.    But the level of risk that companies are willing to take may be affected because of renewed uncertainty. &quot;There is a serious case of oil jitters going on,&quot; said an official at a large drilling firm. &quot;You don't want to commit to a project when you don't know where oil is going.&quot;    Shell, in its Gulf of Mexico decision, notified Reading andamp; Bates Corp. of Tulsa, Okla., that it was giving up use of the Zane Barnes rig, which is one of at most a dozen or so rigs capable of drilling in water as deep as 4,000 feet. Neither company would comment on the rate that Shell was paying, but industry sources put the fee at about $90,000 a day -- eight or nine times the rate of a normal drilling rig.    That would put the cost for Shell at about $33 million a year for the rig alone and doesn't count millions more for personnel, support boats, supplies and other equipment. Shell will have to pay a penalty to Reading for letting the rig go. The rig has been working for Shell in the gulf's deep waters since February 1987, a Reading official said.    Shell's Mr. Little noted that the company will keep another rig for exploration in the gulf's deep waters, where it holds a dominant lease position. &quot;These short-term fluctuations (in price) do give us cause for concern,&quot; he said, but added that &quot;we are not cutting back simply because crude prices are falling.&quot;    In fact, Chevron Corp. officials in San Francisco say the price drop has been too brief for it to even merit scrutiny. &quot;We haven't thought about it enough to decide if this is a hiccup or if it's significant,&quot; said Tom Russell, manager of corporate planning and analysis.    With drilling activity continuing to decline nevertheless, some industry officials point to the billions of dollars of oil assets on the market as another cause. And they note that less-risky drilling for natural gas -- which is easier to find in large quantities in the U.S. than oil -- has been on the rise, and so have natural gas prices. </TEXT></DOC>
