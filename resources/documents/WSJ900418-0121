Environmentalists are pushing the Supreme Court towardthis choice: (1) Get ready for animal, vegetable and mineralplaintiffs, or (2) make sure only real people with real casescan get into court. This is no joke, at least not to legionsof &quot;public-interest&quot; lawyers who, with any luck, could be outof work.</LP><TEXT>   The case of Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, whichthe justices heard on Monday, began in 1985 when theenvironmental group filed a brief from its ObstructionistLawsuit file. It sued the Interior Department for failing todot i's and cross t's in its plan to allow development inparts of 180 million acres throughout 11 Western states, anarea comprising more than 7% of the country's land mass. Theenvironmentalists claimed the usual alleged proceduralshortcomings in environmental-impact statements, land-useplanning papers, public hearings, etc.   Aside from the amount of federal land at stake, what makesthis case unusual is the reason the group gave for beingentitled to sue. It relied chiefly on the complaint by one ofits members, a Peggy Peterson. She said in an affidavit thatInterior's decision to allow development on some of the 180million acres threatened her use of land &quot;in the vicinity of&quot;a two-million-acre parcel in Wyoming where 4,455 acres wouldbe open to mining. Her &quot;recreational use and aestheticenjoyment of federal lands&quot; was threatened.   So the legal issue is whether Peggy Peterson and byextension the National Wildlife Federation had &quot;standing&quot; tosue in court. The federal appeals court in Washington saidthe suit could go forward even though she referred only touse of federal land near a huge tract somewhere within whichmining might occur someday. Meanwhile, for several years oflitigation courts had an injunction against Interior plans toderegulate the 180 million acres.   At Monday's hearing, at least some of the justices seemedskeptical that the Peterson affidavit, with its reference to&quot;in the vicinity of&quot; language, was enough to establishstanding. Justice Antonin Scalia asked the lawyer for theNational Wildlife Federation if the group could sue if theaffidavit complained about &quot;allowing mining in the UnitedStates.&quot; After all, this could conceivably interfere withsomeone's enjoyment of a federal park somewhere.   The justices could rule on the narrow question of thePeterson affidavit. Or they could take on the tough task ofreviewing 20 years' worth of cases on standing. There may beseveral justices who agree that the key breach makingpossible the activist era in the courts was this lowering ofthe test for who can sue whom for what.   After all, judges eager to decide issues previously leftto the political branches of government first must get thepolicy questions before them in a courtroom. By now, it's nosecret that federal courts have become the forum of choicefor many lobbyists, mostly liberals, who haven't found thegive and take of the political system very rewarding.   Indeed, the justices have so lowered the drawbridge intocourt that they may have forgotten how to fill up the moat.One sign of how hard it will be to re-establish standing as abarrier to what has become highly political litigation is the1973 case with the says-it-all title of U.S. v. StudentsChallenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP).   The justices gave standing to what essentially was alaw-school project. Five law students in Washington, D.C.,sued against an Interstate Commerce Commission freight ratechange they said would reduce the incentive to recycle. Thejustices said the students had standing because each ofSCRAP's members &quot;breathes the air within the Washingtonmetropolitan area.&quot;   If this sounds like a trivial requirement to get intocourt, at least it required that the plaintiffs have lungs.The law reviews are full of articles these days criticizingthe &quot;atomistic&quot; idea that only individual human beings withreal problems should be allowed to sue in court. In 1972, theSouthern California Law Review published the classic articlealong these lines, entitled &quot;Should Trees Have Standing?Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects.&quot; It proposed &quot;thewilderness area itself as the plaintiff.&quot;   Absurd? Not to Justice William Douglas, who in adissenting opinion agreed that standing &quot;would be simplifiedand also put neatly in focus if we . . . allowedenvironmental issues to be litigated . . . in the name of theinanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced or invaded.&quot;Other courts -- see box -- think the idea of giving treesstanding is all very amusing.   The big problem with the trees-have-standing approach isthe Constitution. Article III gives courts jurisdiction onlyover &quot;Cases&quot; and &quot;Controversies.&quot; Until recently, everyoneunderstood this to mean that only people with direct andparticular harm can sue. One of the best statements of thisview was in a law review article entitled &quot;The Doctrine ofStanding as an Essential Element of the Separation ofPowers.&quot; This article criticized the result of the loweredstanding requirement as the &quot;over-judicialization of theprocess of self-governance.&quot; The author was Antonin Scalia,then a law professor.   In its brief, the conservative Mountain States LegalFoundation raised this larger separation-of-powers problemwith the case. If the National Wildlife Federation hasstanding to sue and wins, &quot;A court would have to order theexecutive branch to exercise its discretion to prevent miningin that small area of Wyoming.&quot;   Environmentalists have good reason to worry abouttoughened standing requirements. Congress now writes vaguelaws, including the new Clean Air bill, demanding &quot;clean air&quot;and &quot;clean water.&quot; Then Congress leaves it toenvironmentalists to bring cases before federal judges sothat they can decide what clean means. Judges should nolonger let Congress pass the buck.   Put another way, who elected Peggy Peterson, the NationalWildlife Federation or for that matter the federal courts?The Interior Department is the only politically accountablegroup in this litigation. Yet hundreds of its decisions aboutwhich land should be used for which purposes may hang in thebalance between questionably interested litigants andactivist judges.   ---   Despite a law review article urging that trees should havestanding to sue, a Michigan court once upheld a decisionrejecting a suit for damage to a tree with this poem as theentire opinion:                                                                                                          We thought that we would never see   A suit to compensate a tree.   A suit whose claim in tort is prest   Upon a mangled tree's behest;   A tree whose battered trunk was prest   Against a Chevy's crumpled crest,   A tree that faces each new day   With bark and limb in disarray;   A tree that may forever bear   A lasting need for tender care.   Flora lovers though we three   We must uphold the court's decree.</TEXT></DOC>
