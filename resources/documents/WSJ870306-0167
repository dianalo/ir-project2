Here the &quot;Suits,&quot; button-down executives from MCA's &quot;Black Tower&quot; headquarters building, often meet in pitched battle with sweaters-and-jeans-clad producers and writers who work in bungalows scattered below. During a critical skirmish in the studio commissary last year, executives from the Tower warned 150 of MCA's TV producers to simplify scripts and trim shooting days -- or else.    &quot;Some of us agreed. Some didn't understand. Some just said, 'Ho, ho, ho,'&quot; recalls John Stephens, the executive producer of &quot;Simon andamp; Simon.&quot; He adds, &quot;You don't hear the 'Ho, ho, ho's' anymore.&quot;    Studio executives have won a major victory by slashing over-budget spending from about 13% in the 12 months ended last June 30 to approximately zero at present. But the war isn't over. Production budgets -- largely because of union contracts, and salary increases to writers, producers and stars -- are still rising.    For the entire industry, they have climbed about 10% annually for the past five years, and every producer is battling to keep them down. At the moment, for example, Lorimar-Telepictures Corp. is devising a broad cost-containment program. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. has gone through major staff reductions since Rupert Murdoch first bought an interest in the studio in 1985.    But Universal's drive against high costs is especially significant because the studio, one of Hollywood's largest TV producers, has become known among network executives as a &quot;deep pockets,&quot; with sufficient financial strength to support expensive, gimmick-laden action shows. If MCA, too, is pulling in its horns, that bodes evil indeed for costly gimmicks and action.    As recently as two years ago, MCA's prestigious Universal Television unit could prosper while making expensive shows like &quot;Miami Vice&quot; for as much as $600,000 per episode more than networks paid to air them. Rich syndication sales to individual stations would ultimately yield a profit anyway. But that strategy has been undermined: TV ad revenues are soft, so stations can't afford the syndication prices they used to pay; and federal tax-law changes, by ending some investment tax credits that benefited producers, have raised the effective cost of a film.    &quot;The game used to be to spend in pursuit of a hit. But hits don't guarantee profits anymore,&quot; says MCA's television-group president, Robert Harris.    The lowest cost right now for a Universal hour-long TV drama is about $1.2 million per episode -- roughly the budget for &quot;Simon andamp; Simon,&quot; a no-frills private-eye show in its sixth season on CBS. The cost quickly rises to over $1.6 million for shows like &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; which use big-name guest stars or elaborate sets and stunts. MCA's movie division is also a big spender, averaging about $31 million last year to make and market each feature film, compared with about $25 million per movie for the major studios as a group.    &quot;Only an idiot,&quot; says Sidney Sheinberg, MCA's president, could doubt the company's determination to slash such costs. He warns that any producer who doesn't take the cost-cutting seriously &quot;won't be on the payroll anymore.&quot;    That hasn't happened yet, but MCA last year did jolt two of its key TV producers by declining to pick up options to finance two series: &quot;Crime Story,&quot; a costly serial-drama that was produced instead by New World Pictures Ltd. for NBC; and &quot;The Ultimate Adventure Company,&quot; a &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;-like action series that wasn't picked up by any studio.    Partly as a result of those decisions, the studio has slipped to eight hours of prime-time network programming a week, down from 10 1/2 hours in 1985. To shore up its position, MCA is trying to diversify into cheaper, half-hour comedy shows. It also is expanding its production of series for cable and for first-run syndication viewing.    What's more, MCA has begun to shave costs of its trademark hour-long dramas in ways that sharp-eyed viewers couldn't fail to notice. CBS's &quot;Magnum, P.I.,&quot; for instance, was asked to shoot six of its 22 episodes in seven days each rather than the usual eight, resulting in fewer scenes at lush Hawaiian locations. &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; an NBC series that trades on its expensive look, similarly was held to a single big-action sequence per episode. Says Kerry McCluggage, a top MCA TV executive who was supervising producer of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; last year: &quot;We got more realistic about what could be done.&quot;    Thanks to such measures, and to syndication contracts signed when the market was strong, analysts expect MCA's television group to be profitable this year. MCA doesn't break out the earnings of its TV group, which accounted for $663.6 million of the entertainment and real-estate concern's $2.4 billion in 1986 revenue. In the fourth quarter, however, MCA took $50 million in charges related to the TV operation, and the company's quarterly net income fell 58%, to $21.6 million from $51.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1985.    Yet cost-cutting steps tread on ground that is jealously guarded by some powerful creative figures at Universal. William Sackheim, the executive producer of &quot;Hard Copy,&quot; a newspaper drama shown on CBS, says he &quot;went into a rage&quot; on discovering that a production manager had ordered cost-oriented tinkering that resulted in expensive reshooting of one episode. &quot;To save a few dollars, he could have ruined everything we were trying to do,&quot; says the producer, who declines to be more specific about the incident.    A 25-year movie and television veteran, Mr. Sackheim warns that audiences are &quot;too sophisticated to settle for anything but the best production values.&quot; In fact, that delicate concern for quality is one that MCA's &quot;Suits,&quot; protective of what they call the &quot;Universal franchise,&quot; often seem to share despite their desire to cut costs. According to one producer, who declines to be identified, studio executives recently sent an episode of his show back, demanding that it be spruced up with some extra bird chirps -- at a cost of $5,000.    Some studio insiders complain that MCA has shown itself penny-wise and pound-foolish in attacking frills. The company, by Mr. Sackheim's account, recently saved about $300 a day by eliminating a catering truck that used to serve breakfast to the &quot;Hard Copy&quot; crew. But MCA, he says, stands to lose several times as much money if resentment over the step makes his technicians more recalcitrant about union work rules: &quot;You can't take away what people are used to having,&quot; he says.    Still, some MCA executives say they must do exactly that -- or the huge Universal studio facility could ultimately fail to survive in the face of deteriorating television economics. &quot;We're in a dinosauric period,&quot; cautions Daniel Slusser, an MCA senior vice president who oversees the 72-year-old studio property. &quot;I'm not even sure we would build a studio today.&quot;    With 35 sound stages and 420 hillside acres overlooking the San Fernando Valley, Universal Studios is, by Mr. Slusser's boast, the largest movie and television lot &quot;in the free world.&quot; But it is also far larger than is required for MCA's current production needs, which have fallen as movie production dwindled, TV networks shortened seasons and independent TV companies began shooting programs in rented facilities elsewhere, often using nonunion crews.    Network executives, MCA's main customers, sometimes complain about what one CBS officer calls the &quot;enormous waste&quot; at Universal and other studios, which charge huge overhead and facilities fees. Producers say these fees account for up to 25% of the budget of a Universal TV show. Yet Universal's appointments are far from opulent. The studio lacks the lavish private dining rooms of a Warner Bros. or the dazzling executive suites of a Twentieth Century Fox.    Much fat had been lopped off even before the present cost-cutting campaign. Since 1980, Universal has slashed its permanent, full-time payroll by over 30%, to about 400 employees (although, during a busy production season, temporary employees working under contract to Universal can put more than 5,000 employees on the payroll). Several operations, such as the wardrobe and grip departments, have been consolidated and reduced. Others, including cameras and makeup, have been closed in favor of outside contractors, ending Universal's status as the last of Hollywood's &quot;full service&quot; studios.    Some executives say that further savings will depend on concessions from some 35 separate guilds and craft unions. These executives complain that Universal pays union rates that enable a lighting technician to make as much as $74,000 a year, or a prop handler $90,000, even while employees belonging to the same unions undercut the company by working for nonunion rates on independent productions.    Mac St. Johns, a spokesman for the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees, says his union, one of Hollywood's largest, fights that problem by aggressively seeking to organize independents. He adds that few television technicians work a full year and that high pay reflects long hours and even seven-day workweeks for some employees.    Without an accommodation by the unions, says MCA President Sheinberg, the company may shift more of its production to Canada -- or to cheaper facilities and locations in California. Already, Paragon Motion Pictures Inc., a closely held Toronto concern, has been licensed by Universal to produce 13 episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents,&quot; a half-hour series that was canceled by NBC last year and was picked up by the USA cable network. John Slan, Paragon's owner, says his company, aided by favorable exchange rates and relatively loose union contracts, makes an episode for about half the $600,000 that Universal spent on one.    MCA has also contributed about $10 million to a partnership it formed last year with Arthur Annecharico, a Los Angeles producer who has made cut-rate programs for Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s WTBS superstation. Mr. Annecharico says the venture will produce shows cheaply both for syndication and for prime-time network viewing.    An impish 44-year-old who refers to his top fiscal aide as &quot;cheap financial officer,&quot; the producer operates with slimmed-down, nonunion crews, sophisticated cost-watching computers and an open disdain for Hollywood's more glamorous trappings. His company's prop department consists of rubber mallets and other odds and ends stuffed into battered cardboard boxes in one corner of a crowded sound stage.    Mr. Annecharico planned last year, after formation of the partnership with MCA, to produce 24 new episodes of &quot;Airwolf,&quot; an hour-long Universal action show that had been canceled by CBS before the studio had enough programs to justify a syndication sale. But the directors' and writers' guilds struck the show over Mr. Annecharico's refusal to agree to the &quot;residual&quot; payments that studios normally make when TV shows are sold into syndication.    The shows now are being made by a Canadian company, with Mr. Annecharico as executive producer. They cost about $400,000 per episode, compared with about $1.5 million for the Universal-made shows -- in part because Mr. Annecharico splices salvaged footage of stunts and special effects shot for the old shows with dialogue shot for the new ones.    Some Universal executives privately complain that the new episodes suffer from weak scripts and production glitches that may prove too obvious for fussy U.S. audiences. In one recent episode, the name &quot;Lundahl&quot; was prominently displayed in the same camera frame with two different spellings -- the sort of snafu that Universal producers work overtime to correct.    Mr. Annecharico replies that the problems have been ironed out. The new shows, he says, are &quot;equal or superior to&quot; the old ones. </TEXT></DOC>
