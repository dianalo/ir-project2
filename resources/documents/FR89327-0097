Soyland and WIPCO are minority owners of CPS with a combined ownershipshare of less than 15%. Wipco and Soyland, in addition to IP are currentlylicensees for CPS. Therefore, the merger of Soyland and WIPCO will notresult in the transfer of the license to any entity not currently a licenseefor CPS. Soyland will assume full responsibility for all CPS obligationscurrently being discharged by WIPCO. The proposed license amendment willnot change the share of ownership that IP has in CPS, will not change IP'scommitments related to capital and operating and maintenance costs, andwill not affect IP's role as project manager.This revision to the Clinton Power Station license would be made in responseto the licenses' application for amendment dated November 2, 1988.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe change in license is necessary to remove the name of Western IllinoisPower Cooperative, Inc. where that company is referred to in the licensefor CPS. This change is required to reflect the proposed merger of Soylandand WIPCO into one company to be known as Soyland Power Cooperative, Inc.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has concluded that these changes do not significantly increasethe probability or consequences of any accident or increase the potentialfor a radiological release as the revision represents an administrativechange which will not affect plant operation or maintenance. The changedoes not affect the responsibility of IP to operate Clinton, Unit 1 inaccordance with standards and regulations to maintain occupational exposurelevels ``as low as reasonably achievable.'' With regard to non-radiologicalimpacts, the proposed amendment represents no significant non-radiologicalenvironmental impacts for the same reason.Accordingly, the Commission findings in the ``Final Environmental Statementrelated to the operation of Clinton Power Station, Unit No. 1'' dated May1982 regarding radiological environmental impacts from the plant duringnormal operation or after accident conditions, are not adversely alteredby this action.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 22, 1988 (53 FR 47287).No request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed followingthis notice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionsThe principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thisalternative, in effect, would be the same as a ``no action'' alternative.Since the Commission has concluded there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternative withequal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. Alternative Use of ResponsesThis action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Final EnvironmentalStatement dated May 1982 related to this facility.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensees' request of November 2, 1988, anddid not consult other agencies or persons.Finding of no Significant ImpactThe Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementof the proposed license amendment.Based upon this environmental assessment, the Commission concludes thatthe proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality ofthe human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the request for amendmentdated November 2, 1988, and the Final Environmental Statement for the ClintonPower Station dated May 1982, which are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC 20055 and at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West Johnson Street,Clinton, Illinois 61727.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 21st day of March 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul C.
