The unanimous vote by the AMA's 483-member House ofDelegates has the practical effect of spurring theassociation toward heightened lobbying efforts on CapitolHill concerning abortion conseling. The U.S. House ofRepresentatives is scheduled to vote today on a bill thatwould overturn the existing ban on such counseling.</LP><TEXT>   The AMA-approved resolution says the medical group willboth lobby Congress on that bill and &quot;vigorously&quot; oppose anygovernment attempt to &quot;interfere with the physician-patientrelationship.&quot;   Nancy Dickey, a member of the AMA's governing board oftrustees, contended that existing federal regulations banningabortion counseling could lead to other governmentinterference with medicine that would be &quot;much more pervasivethan just dealing with abortion.&quot;   For instance, said Dr. Dickey, AMA members are concernedthe government might enter other areas of medical treatmentthat have become political. One possibility, she suggested,was interference with doctors' ability to inform patientsabout the existence of high-cost technology that could treattheir ailments.   The Bush administration supports existing federal rules --written by the Reagan administration in 1988 -- that precludedoctors at federally funded facilities from advising poorwomen about the availability of abortions.   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld those regulations in adecision in May. The court, through Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist, concluded that the restrictive regulations areconsistent with federal law and don't violate constitutionalrights, such as the right of free speech.   That ruling was considered an important victory for theBush administration. Abortion-rights groups maintained thedecision would make it more difficult to obtain abortions forpoor women and for young women who lack information aboutabortion and have no access to other medical counseling.   The regulations are part of what is known as Title X ofthe federal Public Health Service Act. Recent estimatesindicate government money goes to some 3,900 clinics servingnearly five million women.   The AMA, taking pains to ensure that its action isn'tlimited to the abortion debate, didn't even mention abortionin the measures passed at its convention here. Instead, theassociation denounced &quot;any interference by the government&quot;causing a doctor to &quot;compromise his or her medical judgmentas to what information or treatment is in the best interestof the patient.&quot;   Dr. Dickey and other AMA officials, though, make it clearthat they will lobby Congress for the current abortioncounseling legislation. That bill will require the two-thirdscongressional majority necessary to override the expectedveto of President Bush.   The AMA resolution speaks of the &quot;dangers inherent&quot; inlaws or regulations that &quot;restrict communication betweenphysicians and their patients.&quot;   &quot;We have seen over the last decade more willingness by thegovernment to intercede in medical decisions,&quot; said Dr.Dickey. &quot;But my patients expect that they will get the fullinformation about the treatments available.&quot;   Thus, the thrust of the AMA's vote, supported by doctorsfrom 50 states, was to condemn government prohibitions on anytreatment that becomes a political issue. Dr. Dickey, as afurther example, cited concerns by doctors that thegovernment might seek to limit the medical measures madeavailable to prolong the life of a dying, elderly patient.</TEXT></DOC>
