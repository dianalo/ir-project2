A lawsuit by 137 parents filed in U.S. District Court contendsthat the requirement of the 1986 Tax Reform Act violates theirreligious beliefs and is an invasion of privacy.   ``The ability to invade the privacy of American citizens in thisage of computers is far more likely with this mandatory universalnumbering system than with either universal drug testing orfingerprinting,'' said the complaint.   The law requires that parents place the Social Security numbersof children age 5 and older on tax returns to claim each child as adependent.   Attorney Michael P. Farris said most of the parents areborn-again Christians, many of whom believe that the requirementcontracts with Christ's teaching to ``render under to Caesar thatwhich is Caesar's and render to God that which is God's,'' he said.   ``They believe that God ordained parents as the ones who are tobe responsible for children rather than the government,'' Farrissaid. ``Taxes belong to Caesar but children belong to God.''   Another group believes that the Social Security number used as alaw enforcement tool is a precursor to the ``mark of the beast''prophesied in the Bible, he said.   According to the prophecy, the mark is a number that everyperson would need to buy their soul in a world ruled by theanti-Christ, Farris said.   Most of the parents claimed the exemptions on their tax returnsbut did not provide Social Security numbers, he said. But onefamily with nine children did not claim the exemptions ``just to besafe,'' he said.   The Internal Revenue Service sent warnings to these parents thatthe numbers would be required on their 1988 returns, said IRSspokeswoman Ellen Murphy.   Failure to include the number will result in a $5 penalty butparents wouldn't automatically lose the $2,000 exemption claimedfor each child.   Parents who don't comply in 1988 could be asked to prove theirchild is a dependent.   Congress adopted the requirement when it raised the exemptionfrom $1,000 to $2,000 as part of the tax-reform legislation passedtwo years ago.   ``One of the reasons why Congress changed the law was becausethrough the years our taxpayer compliance measuring programs hadindicated a fairly high incidence of parents who are living apartclaiming their children on both returns,'' Murphy said.   ``With the increase in the value of the personal exemption ...obviously the revenue impact of the non-compliance was going to beincreased,'' she said.   Farris said a number of the plaintiffs educate their children athome in violation of state laws that require attendance at publicschools.   They fear that Social Security numbers could be used tocross-check children to ensure they are attending school.   Virginia, for instance, requires children to have SocialSecurity cards to attend public school, said Farris, who is a staffattorney for the Home School Legal Defense Association in GreatFalls, Va.   The group helps parents in the home-school movement but is not aparty to the case.   Murphy said the IRS does not share Social Security numbers orany other tax information with other government agencies, exceptfor tax enforcement.</TEXT></DOC>
