All but three of theamendment proposals considered at the hearing were submitted by the IndustryCommittee (committee) established under the order. The United States Departmentof Agriculture (Department) proposed the addition of provisions protectingthe confidentiality of information provided by handlers and specifyingthat the Secretary and the committee may verify the correctness of reportsfiled by handlers and compliance with recordkeeping requirements. In addition,the Department proposed that it be authorized to make any necessary conformingchanges.<ITAG tagnum="84">Small Business Considerations</ITAG>In accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)(5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Servicehas determined that this action would not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. Small agricultural producershave been defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) (13 CFR 121.2)as those having annual gross revenues for the last three years of lessthan $500,000. Small agricultural service firms, which include shippersunder this marketing agreement and order, are defined as those firms withgross annual receipts of less than $3,500,000.The purpose of the FRA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Interested persons were invited in thenotice of hearing to present evidence at the hearing on the probable regulatoryand informational impact of the proposed changes on small businesses. Marketingorders issued pursuant to the Act and rules issued thereunder are uniquein that they are brought about through group action of essentially smallentities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both the RFA and the Act arecompatible with respect to small entities.During the 1987 season, approximately 30 handlers of Georgia peaches weresubject to regulation under the order. In addition, there are approximately265 peach producers in Georgia. The majority of these handlers and producersmay be classified as small entities.The proposed amendment of andSection; 918.26 to limit the terms of officeof commitee members of six consecutive one-year terms would facilitatea regular rotation in committee membership and broaden industry participationin committee decision making. This would strengthen the program withoutadversely impacting small entities.Revising andSection; 918.30(a) to alter the committee voting procedures torequire at least one affirmative vote from each of the three producer representationdistricts for any recommendation on size regulations would ensure thatthere was support for such recommendations in each district. The proposalshould benefit small entities in all representation districts.The proposal to add a new andSection; 918.61a would authorize the committee,with the approval of the Secretary, to establish container, pack, and container-markingregulations in order to facilitate the efficient marketing of Georgia peachesand benefit producers and handlers. Such authority could reduce containerand other marketing costs which would benefit small entities. Any savingswould be directly proportional to the quantity of peaches handled. Theimpact of any particular proposed container, pack, and container-markingregulations would, of course, be considered at the time that such proposalwould be made.The proposed change amending andSection; 918.64, would authorize the committee,with the approval of the Secretary, to establish positive lot identificationprocedures for peaches inspected under the order and would facilitate thecommittee's compliance effort by providing it with a reliable means oftying the inspection certificates it receives to the lots covered by thecertificates. This could benefit both producers and handlers because theminimum quality and size requirements established under the order are importantto the industry in fostering consumer satisfaction and increasing the demandfor Georgia peaches. Hence, any advantages resulting from these procedureswould be expected to outweigh any additional costs incurred by growersand handlers for positive lot identification. The additional costs wouldbe proportional to the quantity of peaches handled. The impact of any particularproposal pertaining to positive lot identification would be consideredat the time it is made. The proposed addition of andSection; 918.72 would authorize the committee,with the approval of the Secretary, to establish or provide for the establishmentof production research and market research and development projects inorder to facilitate research on many of its production and marketing problems.Such projects would benefit producers and handlers and would not adverselyimpact small entities. Any costs associated with this provision would beoutweighed by the benefits of such projects.The proposed amendment to andSection; 918.81 would require a continuancereferendum at least every six years which would provide producers a morefrequent opportunity of periodically voting on whether the order shouldbe continued. Such referenda would not adversely affect small entities.The proposed amendment to andSection; 918.76 containing provisions whichwould require confidential information provided by handlers to be protectedfrom disclosure would improve operation of the order and would not adverselyaffect small entities.The addition of andSection; 918.77 authorizing the Secretary and the committeeto verify the correctness of reports filed by handlers and to check handlercompliance with recordkeeping requirements also would improve operationof the order and would not adversely affect small entities. All of the proposed changes set forth in this document are designed toenhance the administration, operation, and functioning of the order. Theproposed amendments to the order would not have a significant impact onthe recordkeeping and reporting burdens of the Georgia peach industry.Moreover, the proposed changes would not appreciably change the reportingand recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), which have been previously approved by the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB No. 0581-0135. The action includesproposed amendments that would require information to be retained by handlersfor at least two years. The evidence of record indicates that handlersgenerally maintain such information in the normal course of business forperiods longer than two years. The information collection requirementscontained in this proposal action will be submitted to OMB for approval.The requirements will not become effective prior to OMB approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">Material Issues</ITAG>The material issues of record addressed in this decision are:(1) Whether to limit the terms of office of committee members to six consecutiveyears;(2) Whether to change committee voting procedures on size regulation recommendationsby requiring one affirmative member vote from each of the three growingdistricts;(3) Whether to authorize container and pack regulations and container markingregulations;(4) Whether to add authority for positive lot identification proceduresfor inspected peaches;(5) Whether to authorize production research and marketing research anddevelopment projects;(6) Whether to require a referendum at least every six years to determineif growers are in favor of continuing the order;(7) Whether to add provisions to protect the confidentiality of informationprovided by handlers;(8) Whether to add provisions allowing the Secretary and the committeeto verify the correctness of reports filed by handlers and ascertain handlercompliance with recordkeeping requirements; and(9) Whether conforming changes should be made.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions</ITAG>The findings and conclusions on the material issues, all of which are basedon evidence adduced at the hearing and the record thereof, are:(1) Section 918.26 should be amended by adding a proviso to limit the tenureof committee members to six consecutive one-year terms. Currently, membersand alternates may serve an indefinite number of one-year terms.The evidence of record indicates that the limitation on tenure would improvecommittee representation by bringing additional persons with differentview points and experiences into active roles in the administration ofthe program. This would be beneficial to the committee's operations; moreover,such a limitation would encourage and foster to the maximum extent possiblebroad-based participation by all members of the industry in the administrationof the order.The provisions limiting each member's tenure to six consecutive one-yearterms of office should apply starting with the term of office beginningMarch 1, 1989. The provisions would not apply to the number of consecutiveterms alternate members may serve. Moreover, any person after having servedsix consecutive terms as member shall be immediately eligible to serveas an alternate member but shall not be eligible to serve again as a memberuntil the term of office which begins one year later.Consideration was given as to whether there would be enough qualified candidatesin each district committee service in view of the planned rotation. Therecord evidence indicates that there are approximately 265 peach growers.Moreover, peach production is widely dispersed among the three districts.Therefore, there should be enough qualified candidates to serve on thecommittee in each district. Also, inasmuch as there is only one publicmember position on the committee, there should be enough qualified candidatesfrom the entire State of Georgia to fill such position. However, to guardagainst the possibility of a position remaining vacant because of a lackof eligible nominees or eligible persons willing to serve, the Secretaryshould have the authority to exempt an individual from the tenure limitation.Such an exception would be made only in special and unusual circumstances.Limiting the tenure of committee members as proposed would be in accordancewith the Secretary's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and SpecialityCrop Marketing Orders.''(2) Section 918.15 provides for the establishment of a committee, consistingof nine members and alternate members to administer the order locally.This section also specifies that eight members and alternates shall begrowers of peaches and that one member and alternate shall be individualswho are neither growers nor handlers of peaches. As specified in andSection;918.16, the members of the committee are apportioned among three growerdistricts referred to as the South Georgia District, the Central GeorgiaDistrict, and the North Georgia District. Of the eight grower positionson the committee, the Central Georgia District is apportioned four positionsand the other two districts are apportioned two positions each. The currentcommittee procedural requirements in andSection; 918.30 for the conduct ofbusiness require a quorum of five, and five concurring votes for the adoptionof recommendations. These procedures should be changed by requiring atleast one affirmative committee member vote from each district for anyrecommendations on size regulations to be valid.Over the past several years, there have been differences of opinion amongthe growers from the South Georgia District and the growers from the Centraland North Districts on the level of the minimum size (diameter) requirementsneeded to successfully market fresh Georgia peaches. The growers from thesouthern district tend to produce a higher percentage of small peachesin the 1\5/8\ to 1\3/4\ inch in diameter range than the growers in theother two districts. In 1986, a total of 3,992.25 bushels of size 1\5/8\inch or smaller peaches were shipped to regulated markets from all threedistricts. A total of 3,014.25 (or 75 percent) of those shipments originatedfrom the South Georgia District. Hence, any increase in minimum size requirementscould affect South Georgia growers more than the growers from the centraland northern parts of the state.Recommendations to increase and to decrease the size requirements havebeen made by the committee and implemented by the Department several timessince the late 1970's. Currently, any peaches shipped to regulated marketscannot be smaller than 1\3/4\ inches in diameter (lot and container tolerancesare prescribed allowing for some smaller peaches to be shipped).To protect themselves from possible size increases thought necessary bythe growers from the Central and North Georgia Districts, the South Georgiagrowers in 1984 submitted a formal request to the Department to amend theorder. The requested proposed that the South Georgia District be excludedfrom the production area, or in the alternative, that grade and size recommendationsapplicable to South Georgia growers be made by growers in that districtunder a separate order. In light of this request and numerous failed attemptsto resolve this issue at the committee level, the Department decided tohold a referendum in the fall of 1986 to determine whether Georgia peachgrowers as a whole favored continuance of the order. Of the growers voting,76 percent favored continuance and they represented 89 percent of the peachesproduced by those voting.Subsequent to the announcement of the results of that referendum, the committeeheld further discussions and unanimously agreed to request the Departmentto amend the order to prescribe a permanent 1\3/4\ inch size regulation.However, after further considering the inflexibility of its recommendation,the committee met again and on January 18, 1988, unanimously agreed towithdraw its proposal and in its place recommended that the order be amendedto require that any future size regulation recommendation receive at leastone concurring vote from each of the three districts and continue to requireat least five concurring votes for any size recommendation to pass.One of the factors considered in the evaluation of this proposal, insofaras it would enable any one district to defeat any motion by the other twodistricts to change size regulations, was whether it would adversely impactthe long-term interest of growers. The Secretary's ``Guidelines for Fruit,Vegetable and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' recognize that qualityrequirements and size regulations can lead to long term market expansion.Those guidelines also emphasize the importance of establishing qualityand size requirements which are flexible enough to maximize the marketingof all fruit suitable for consumption in fresh form. The testimony indicatedthat this proposal would provide such flexibility inasmuch as it wouldassure the growers of each district a decisive role in the committee'srecommendations concerning size regulations. This recognizes that peachesgrown in the three districts are of different varieties and have differentcharacteristics, and that it is important to have a clear consensus ofopinion within the industry to assure success in achieving program objectives.Therefore, the committee's size regulation recommendations should be subjectedto a more rigorous test of industry agreement. To accomplish this, thelast sentence of andSection; 918.30 should be revised to specify that forany recommendation of the Industry Committee to be valid, not less thanfive affirmative votes shall be necessary: <T3>Provided, </T3>That any decision on minimum size regulations also shallrequire at least one concurring vote from each district.(3) A new andSection; 918.61(a) should be added providing that whenever theIndustry Committee deems it advisable to establish a container regulationfor any variety or varieties of peaches, it shall recommend to the Secretarythe size, capacity, weight, markings, or pack of the container, or containerswhich may be used in the handling of these peaches. It also should be providedthat if the Secretary finds upon the basis of such recommendation or otherinformation available that such container regulation would tend to effectuatethe declared policy of the Act, the Secretary shall establish such regulations.Notice of the effective dates of any container regulation shall be sentby the Industry Committee to all handlers of record before the effectivedate of the regulation so they can plan accordingly.The evidence of record indicates that there are 30 commercial packinghousesin Georgia that ship peaches in interstate commerce. These packinghousespack their peaches in 25 different packages of one-half bushel and three-quarterbushel capacities manufactured by six corrugated box companies. Many ofthe containers differ in construction and dimensions, but not capacity.Testimony indicated that the practice of packing peaches in such an arrayof containers of differing types, shapes, strengths, and dimensions hassignificantly increased packaging costs. With container uniformity, proponentsbelieve that the cost of containers could be reduced through economiesof scale; carton manufacturers can produce large lots of a few types ofcontainers less expensively than they can produce small quantities of manystyles and types of containers.The evidence of record also indicates that many of the containers usedare not providing adequate protection to minimize physical injury duringtransit and marketing. Moreover, peaches from different packinghouses areoften commingled and because the containers are not of comparable sizethey are difficult to load in a stable configuration. Movement during transithas resulted in physical injury to the peaches. Container standardizationwould allow commingled loads to be packed more tightly, thus reducing injuryto the peaches, and in-transit losses. Through the use of container regulationsthe committee could foster the use of containers and packages offeringthe most protection during transit and which are more efficient in maintainingfruit quality.The proponents indicated that any container limitations would be recommendedonly after thorough study and research and that handlers should be allowedto utilize their existing inventories to avoid wastage and higher packagingcosts.Some Georgia peach shippers pack volume fill, tray packs, and bulk bincontainers utilizing a size system referred to in the industry as the ``everythingand up'' pack. Under this system, containers of ``one and three quartersand up'' hold peaches varying in size from one and three-quarters to threeinches in diameter, the maximum diameter usually reached by peaches grownin Georgia. This lack of uniformity in the size of the peaches from containerto container has caused misunderstandings in the marketplace between theshippers and buyers. The proponents indicated that the confusion betweenthe buyers and shippers has hindered sales of Georgia peaches.The proponents contend that these misunderstandings can be avoided whena packing system, with moderate separation between the lower and highersizes (diameters), is used. Some shippers in the industry have begun topack sizes ranging between one and three-quarters to two inches, two inchesto two and one-half inches, and two and one-half to three inches in diameter.The proponents indicated that these packs have fostered better communicationsand improved relationships with their buyers because there is less variabilitybetween the peaches in the containers and less chance of misunderstandings.Because of this, the proponents believe that the use of these packs onan industry-wide basis could lead to increased buyer satisfaction and increasedsales. Therefore, authority allowing the committee, with the approval ofthe Secretary, to establish different pack and container specificationsfor different size and quality peaches shipped into regulated markets wouldbe beneficial to the Georgia peach industry.The evidence of record further indicates that authority to require accurateand uniform marking of the containers in which Georgia peaches are shippedwould help interested persons more readily identify the shipments and thebuyers in storing and retrieving the peaches at destination. These advantagescan foster buyer satisfaction.The record indicates that experience has shown that containers which areclearly marked and identified move through the marketing and distributionsystem more efficiently. This is especially important in handling a perishablecommodity like peaches with a limited shelf life. Peaches can be kept inreasonably good condition after harvest for up to 14 days if handled properlyand kept in cold storage. Ideally they should arrive at the marketplacein four to five days. The use of incorrect marking as to variety, sizeand other factors have unduly delayed Georgia peach shipments.Also, clear markings will enable the Industry Committee to more easilydetermine whether the peaches have been inspected and certified as requiredunder the order and other identifying information such as the name of theshipper.Any marking requirements could require the containers to be clearly markedand identified with the variety of the peaches; net weight, count, and/orvolume; name and address of the packer or shipper; origin of the peaches;size and grade if applicable; and any other information on quality andpack of fruit as may be required under the order.In connection with this recommended change, a minor conforming change inthe first sentence of andSection; 918.63 is necessary. The provisions ofthat sentence reference andSection;andSection; 918.60 and 918.61. These referencesshould be changed to andSection;andSection; 918.60 through 918.61a in orderto include the proposed section on container regulations.(4) The evidence of record indicates that most peach packinghouses (i.e.,handlers) in Georgia pack more than their own production. As a consequence,the trucks, trailers or other modes of transportation conveying the shipmentsto their final destination normally contain lots from several growers and/orpackers at the same time which have been inspected and certified as meetingthe minimum grade, quality, size and maturity requirements establishedunder the order.Section 918.64 requires handlers to cause each shipment of peaches to regulatedmarkets to be inspected by the Federal Inspection Service or the Federal-StateInspection Service or any other designated inspection service. The handlersalso are required to promptly provide the Industry Committee a copy ofeach inspection certificate issued. These procedures enable the committeeto determine how many packages of a given brand or mark have been certifiedon a day-to-day basis. Currently, however, without positive lot identificationprocedures, the committee lacks the ability to determine precisely if anygiven lot has been inspected. This limitation is especially troublesomeon those loads made up of lots from different growers and handlers.Under the lot inspection and certification system currently employed underthe order a licensed inspector selects samples and performs the inspectionin accordance with established procedures and practices, and issues anofficial certification on the inspected product. Shipper brands and thename of the packers/shippers or growers usually are used on the certificatefor the purpose of identifying the inspected lots. This type of inspectionand certification has been used to determine that the lots or brands havebeen inspected as required under the order. However, because the identificationmarks appearing on the certificates are not necessarily unique to inspectedcartons of fruit shipped, the committee's compliance checks are more difficultbecause a particular load or lot cannot be positively identified as havingbeen inspected. Any handler who has a certificate covering a given numberof cartons of a particular brand or mark could pack additional fruit insimilarly marked cartons and could represent these cartons as the onescovered by the certificate.Positive lot identification procedures provide an efficient and effectivemeans of positively linking a load or lot in a truck or other mode of transportationto a specific inspection certificate. Under such procedures, the inspectionservice, in addition to sampling, inspecting and certifying the product,also becomes directly involved in identifying the product so that it caneasily be tied to a specific certificate. The fruit must be packed andthe required identification must be affixed to the cartons or the conveyanceunder the observation and supervision of the inspector.It is the proponents' view that such procedures would make it more difficultfor handlers to bypass the inspection and certification requirements establishedunder the order and make the committee's compliance activities somewhateasier because loads or lots could be correlated to specific certificates.Georgia peaches destined to regulated markets tend to be made up of commingledlots from various growers and handlers. Providing the committee with theability to tie specific certificates to particular lots of varying qualityand size could help the committee more easily ascertain compliance of individuallots with the quality and size requirements implemented under the orderand make it more difficult for handlers to circumvent order requirements.The quality and size requirements implemented under the order are importantto the industry in fostering consumer satisfaction and increasing the demandfor Georgia peaches.Implementation of such procedures would increase handler inspection costs.However, the magnitude of the increase is diffiuclt to quantify becauseit depends on the type of positive lot procedures implemented. The committeeshould thoroughly assess program benefits and costs before recommendingpositive lot identification procedures.Therefore, andSection; 918.64 should be amended by adding paragraph (b) providingthat the Industry Committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary,positive lot identification requirements for lots of peaches inspectedand certified pursuant to this section. Whenever implemented, such requirementsshould at least specify that upon inspection, all peaches shall be identifiedby tags, stamps, marks, or other means of identification recognized bythe inspection service, that such identification shall be affixed to thecontainer by the handler under the supervision of an inspector, and thatsuch identification shall not be altered or removed except as directedby an inspector. The language in proposed andSection; 918.64(b) has beenchanged from that which appeared in the notice of hearing. This changeis for clarity and would reference the inspection services that appearin paragraph (a) of the proposed section. For the purposes of inspectionand positive lot identification procedures, lot means the aggregate quantityof peaches of the same variety, in like containers with like identificationoffered for inspection as a shipping unit.In the notice of hearing, the provisions proposed in andSection; 918.64 wouldhave authorized the Industry Committee to prescribe the means of identification,allowed the identification to be affixed to the containers under the supervisionof the Industry Committee, and allowed the identification to be alteredor removed under the direction of the Industry Committee. However, in implementingpositive lot identification procedures, these activities are best performedby the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service. Accordingly, the recommendedprovisions of paragraph (b) would require all of these activities to beperformed by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service.No evidence was presented at the hearing concerning other safeguards whichmight be needed to properly and positively identify peach shipments andprevent shipments of uninspected peaches. Hence, when the Industry Committeehas considered the details of handling, storing, and shipping peaches underpositive lot identification requirements, these procedures should be establishedthrough the informal rulemaking process. The proponents did indicate thatsuch procedures and safeguards should be designed to assure that the lotsof inspected peaches shipped and delivered were the same peaches describedon the inspection certificate covering the lot and that the Industry Committeewould work closely with the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Servicein developing the procedures necessary to accomplish these goals.(5) Section 918.72 should be added to permit the Industry Committee, withthe approval of the Secretary, to establish, or provide for the establishmentof projects involving production research, and marketing research and developmentdesigned to assist, improve or promote the marketing, distribution andconsumption of peaches and the efficient production of peaches. The expensesof such projects would be paid from funds collected pursuant to andSection;918.41, or from any other sources approved by the Secretary. Under the authority contained in proposed andSection; 918.72 the IndustryCommittee could undertake or contract for such projects or support ongoingprojects to find solutions to its production and marketing problems whichwill be beneficial to the peach industry in Georgia. It is not expectedthat the funds likely to become available from assessements will be sufficientto conduct large research and development projects directly, because thefinancial resources of the Georgia peach industry are limited. However,the authorization would permit the committee to cooperate more effectivelyin projects conducted by Federal or State agencies, educational institutions,and private research organizations through contracts or other appropriatemeans. The authorization would also allow the Industry Committee to useother sources of income approved by the Secretary to fund needed productionresearch and market research and development projects.Hearing testimony was presented noting that public funds are becoming increasinglydifficult to obtain. The delay in research on split pits and pit fragmentswas given as an example of the difficulties experienced in obtaining researchfunds. The proponents emphasized that this authority would allow the committeeto provide researchers with needed funds to establish or continue industry-relatedresearch projects. Under the proposed authority the Industry Committee could range for theconduct of production research in the areas of insect and disease control,tree and crop research, and fumigant, insecticide, fertilizer, and herbicideapplication. The proponents indicated that research in these areas couldhelp the industry improve its yield per acre, improve the quality of thepeaches produced, and reduce production costs. Research in the areas ofmarket research and market development could help the industry market itspeaches and reduce its marketing costs. More specifically, research couldbe used by the industry to study the effects of its minimum quality regulationsin fostering increased peach sales. Research could also be conducted oncontainers to determine which containers perform the best in the marketingchain. Market development research could involve efforts to identify newmarkets for peaches. Researchers could survey peach buyers at chain storesand terminal markets and consumers of peaches in an effort to better understandthe quality attributes that consumers desire in peaches. It is not intendedthat Industry Committee efforts under this provision would be limited tothe activities mentioned above, but that it have broad discretion, withthe approval of the Secretary, in determining the types of research anddevelopment efforts which it believes will be beneficial to the Georgiapeach industry as a whole.Inasmuch as there is a need for greater effort and participation of theindusry in the solution of its common problems, and because the authorityto conduct such research activities can be expected to contribute to themore efficient production and marketing of Georgia peaches, it is concludedthat this provision should be addd to the order.(6) Section 918.81 should be amended by redesignating paragraph (d) asparagraph (e) and adding a new paragraph (d) to require that referendaon continuance of the order be held a minimum of every six years afterthe effective date of the amendment. Currently, the order does not providefor the conduct of periodic continuance referenda, but does provide thatthe Secretary shall conduct a continuance referendum when recommended bythe committee, or upon the request of six or more growers who produced10 percent or more of the inspected peaches shipped during the then currentfiscal period as long as such request is received prior to December 1.The Secretary of Agriculture has determined that continuance referendaare an effective means for ascertaining whether producers favor continuationof marketing order programs. Currently, the order and the Act provide thatthe Secretary shall terminate the marketing order program whenever, throughthe conduct of a referendum, it is indicated that a majority of all producersfavor termination and such majority produced more than 50 percent of thecommodity for market during a representative period. Since less than 50percent of all producers usually participate in a referendum, it is difficultto determine producer support for an order. Thus, to provide a basis fordetermining whether producers favor continuance of the order, andSection;918.81should be amended to provide for continuance referenda. The results ofcontinuance referenda should be based upon the same percentage of supportrequired in section 8c(8) of the Act with respect to producer approvalof the issuance of a marketing order. This requirement is considered adequateto measure producer support to continue the marketing order. The Secretarywould consider termination of the order if less than two-thirds of theproducers voting in the referendum and producers of less then two-thirdsof the volume of fruit represented in the referendum favor continuance.In evaluating the merits of continuance versus termination, the Secretarywould not only consider the results of the referendum but also would considerall other relevant information concerning the operation of the order andthe relative benefits and disadvantages to producers, handlers,and consumersin order to determine whether continued operation of the order would tendto effectuate the declared policy of the Act. In this regard, in the eventof an adverse vote by producers in a continuance referendum, the Secretarymay solicit input from the public through meetings, press releases, orother means.In any event, section 8c(16)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to terminatethe order whenever the Secretary finds that the majority of all producersfavor termination, and that such majority produced more than 50 percentof the commodity for market. To be effective, termination of the order,resulting from any referendum, should be announced on or before the lastday of the then current fiscal period. The fiscal period for this programends the last day of February. This date precedes the beginning of thecommittee's operation for a new fiscal period and is considered to be anappropriate time to terminate the operations of the order.The Secretary's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop MarketingOrders'' provide for periodic referenda to allow producers the opportunityto indicate their support for or rejection of a marketing order. The Departmentbelieves that periodic referenda ensure that marketing order programs continueto be accountable to their producers, obligate producers to evaluate theirprograms periodically, and involve them more closely in their operation.The record evidence supports these goals.Therefore, the order should be amended providing that the Secretary shallconduct a referendum among growers a minimum of every six years after theeffective date of this amended subpart to ascertain whether continuanceof this part is favored by growers. However, when a continuance referendumis conducted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, this referendumshall be conducted six years after the referendum conducted pursuant toparagraph (c). The Secretary may terminate the provisions of this partat the end of any fiscal period in which the Secretary has found that continuanceof this part is not favored by producers who, during a representative period,determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the production for marketof the fruit in the production area, except that termination of this partshall be effective only if announced on or before the last day of the thencurrent fiscal period.(7) A new andSection;918.76 as proposed by the Department should be addedto specify that confidential information provided by them would be protectedfrom disclosure. To effect this change, andSection;918.76 should specifythat all data or other information constituting a trade secret or disclosinga trade position or business condition shall be received by, and kept inthe custody of, one or more designated employees of the committee, andinformation which would reveal the circumstances of a single handler shallbe disclosed to no person other than the Secretary, except as requiredby law.Although the provisions would appear in the order for the first time, therequirements are not new. The Act under which the order is issued alreadyrequires that such information be kept confidential and the statutory requirementshave been implemented through the supervision of the Industry Committee(and similar committees for other marketing order commodities) by the Department.Section 918.76 would specify the procedures which will be followed to keepcertain information submitted to the committee by handlers confidential.These provisions would specify that designated employees of the committeewould have the responsibility for safeguarding the confidentiality of alldata and information submitted by handlers to the committee, which constitutesa trade secret or discloses a trade position or business condition of anindividual handler. All such information submitted would be received byand kept in the custody of one or more designated employees of the committee.Information submitted by handlers would remain confidential and would bedisclosed to no person other than the Secretary or persons authorized bythe Secretary to review such information unless disclosure is otherwiserequired by law. This is necessary to prevent the disclosure of informationthat may affect the financial position or business operations of individualhandlers. Under certain circumstances, the release of composite informationcompiled from data and information submitted by handlers has been helpfulto the Industry Committee and the industry in planning operations underthe marketing order and this will be continued. However, as in the past,such composite information would not disclose the identities of the individualhandlers or their separate business operations.(8) A new andSection;918.77 should be added, as proposed by the Fruit andVegetable Division, AMS, to expressly state in the order language the rightof the Secretary, and confer such right on the committee, to verify thecorrectness of reports filed by handlers and to check handler compliancewith recordkeeping requirements.This proposal would merely specify in the order the investigative authorityalready provided by the Act. Section 918.77 would specify that the Secretaryand the committee, through its duly authorized employees, would have accessto any premises where handlers' peaches are held and, at any time duringnormal business hours, would be permitted to examine any such peaches andany and all records with respect to matters within the purview of thismarketing order. Handlers would be responsible for furnishing labor asmay be necessary to facilitate such examinations. The Secretary and dulyauthorized committee employees would have the authority to examine andaudit records of all handlers to determine compliance with provisions ofthis marketing order. The committee would report the results of such examinationsand audits to the Secretary.So that the committee would be able to perform investigations effectivelyand to verify compliance under this marketing order, each handler wouldbe required to maintain complete record which accurately show such handler'sacquisition and disposition of peaches each season, including the quantityof peaches held, sold, and shipped. Such information is generally maintainedby handlers in the normal course of business and would not impose additionalcosts and reporting burdens on the handlers.Further, should it be found necessary, the committee, with the approvalof the Secretary, would have the authority to issue regulations which wouldestablish the type of records which must be maintained. Handlers wouldbe required to keep the records for at least two years following the endof each fiscal period. A two-year period should afford the committee'semployees adequate time for examining and reviewing such records in theevent of alleged program violations by handlers. This requirement shouldnot impose an undue burden on handlers, since such records are likely retainedfor a similar or longer period under normal business practices.(9) The Department proposed in the notice of hearing that it be authorizedto make any necessary changes in the order language to make the entireorder conform with any amendments resulting from this proceeding. Thisproposal was supported at the hearing without opposition. Such conformingchanges as necessary and stated herein have been incorporated in this recommendeddecision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulings on Briefs of Interested Persons</ITAG>At the conclusion of the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge fixed June17, 1988, as the final date for interested persons to file proposed findingsand conclusions and written arguments or briefs, based on the evidencereceived at the hearing.
