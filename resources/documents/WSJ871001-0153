The Washington superlawyer, an ostensible Democrat with sterling civil-rights and civil-liberties credentials, wrote an influential op-ed piece in the New York Times at the beginning of the debate over President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court. In that article, Mr. Cutler argued that Judge Bork is basically a moderate, &quot;neither an ideologue nor an extreme right-winger.&quot; Judge Bork, according to Mr. Cutler, is essentially similar in judicial philosophy to Justice Lewis Powell, the man he would like to succeed, and therefore his appointment really wouldn't change things very much. Why, he probably wouldn't even overturn Roe v. Wade, the abortion decision.    This nothing-to-worry-about theme, based on the notion of Bork-the-moderate whose arrival on the court would make virtually no difference, became the cornerstone of the White House strategy to get Judge Bork confirmed by the Senate. The entire focus of the White House campaign, orchestrated by Chief of Staff Howard Baker and lobbyist Tom Korologos, became how &quot;mainstream&quot; Judge Bork is. The president himself cited Mr. Cutler's article. (Who knows? He may even have read it. It's short.) Mr. Cutler actually became part of the White House team preparing Judge Bork for the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.    It's clear now this strategy has been a disaster. Before the hearings, Judge Bork was widely favored to win the confirmation vote, on the Senate floor if not in the committee. Though the battle is far from over, the odds now favor Judge Bork's opponents. Sen. Alan Cranston counts 49 senators against the Bork nomination, 40 in favor and 11 undecided. He says at least five have switched from &quot;yea&quot; to &quot;nay&quot; in the past couple of weeks. Even more encouraging, from the anti-Bork point of view: Human Events, the right-wing sheet not noted for its temperate nature or reluctance to claim victory, says the Bork vote is &quot;Too Close to Call.&quot;    The no-big-deal strategy has been disastrous for two reasons. First, it's not just transparently dishonest but transparently absurd. Complaints about the drift of the Supreme Court have been a central theme in President Reagan's politics since he became a prominent national conservative spokesman in 1964. Similar complaints, albeit on a higher intellectual plane, have been the focus of Robert Bork's legal philosophy since he began establishing his well-deserved reputation as a powerful thinker about the same time.    The idea that Mr. Reagan, given the opportunity to replace the Supreme Court's swing vote, would pick a man largely identical to his predecessor is silly. The idea that Judge Bork is such a man is even sillier. Judge Bork's strained attempt during his testimony to accommodate himself to this myth raised the hackles of several swing senators. It also raised questions about his intellectual integrity. And it undermined his reputation as a towering judicial philosopher -- someone who's got it all figured out -- which was his greatest strength even among those who wished to disagree with him. He became mortal, and easier to vote against.    Judge Bork's new-found flexibility has unnerved even some of his scholarly admirers. His most alarming flip-flop concerns his understanding of the 14th Amendment's clause guaranteeing all citizens the &quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot; This phrase is universally understood to forbid government discrimination. The problem has been in limiting its scope. After all, every law or other government action discriminates between citizens: one gets a contract, others don't; one goes to jail, others remain free; one gets into state university, others are turned down.    The Supreme Court doctrine that has evolved is that certain distinctions are inherently &quot;suspect&quot; and therefore get &quot;strict scrutiny,&quot; whereas others are permissible as long as there is a &quot;rational relationship&quot; between the distinction and a legitimate government goal. In practice, &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; has meant the law gets shot down and &quot;rational relationship&quot; has meant the law gets upheld. Fair enough -- governments almost always have a &quot;rational&quot; reason for what they do, if not a wise one.    Judge Bork has maintained throughout his scholarly career that &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; should be limited to racial discrimination, and has attacked Supreme Court rulings that the 14th Amendment forbids discrimination against women, aliens, illegitimate children, and so on. In his confirmation hearings, though, he astonished constitutional mavens by declaring that he would &quot;arrive at all of the same results, I think -- or virtually all of the same results&quot; by holding that the laws were irrational.    If Judge Bork is serious, this is a far more &quot;activist&quot; approach than that of any liberal currently licensed to practice judicial activism. Liberal constitutional scholars have struggled to explain why certain groups are entitled to special judicial protection -- a struggle Judge Bork has ridiculed. Now, out of the blue he declares that the struggle is not merely futile but superfluous: Judges may throw out any law they think lacks a &quot;reasonable basis.&quot; He can't be serious.    Judge Bork's supporters complain that he is being whipsawed. First his opponents accuse him of being too rigid. Now they accuse him of being too flexible. The point, though, isn't flexibility. The point is that either he doesn't really have a coherent philosophy after all, or -- more likely -- he's bluffing to get himself confirmed.    But disingenuousness is hardly always fatal in politics. A second flaw in the &quot;mainstream&quot; strategy is that it has failed to galvanize popular support for Bork. Undecided senators have been inundated with alarmed appeals from constituents mobilized by the hysterical, and often unfair, campaign against Judge Bork by liberal groups. No such passion has been generated by similar groups on the right. How could it be? Whose &quot;hot button&quot; (that's direct-mail fund-raising industry lingo) is going to be pushed by the idea of putting someone on the court who is a mainstream moderate and won't have much of an impact? If he won't even overturn the abortion decision, who needs him?    There was wonderful irony in yesterday's Journal article about how much more successful anti-Bork groups have been than pro-Bork groups in raising money. The conservatives complain bitterly that the expensive anti-Bork campaign is unfair. &quot;The left is trying to buy a Supreme Court seat,&quot; one of them pouted. Of course these techniques of raising money and influencing congressional opinion through the scientific generation of hysteria were pioneered by the right in the 1970s. Now the tables are turned.    What the Bork campaign has been reduced to was revealed, perhaps unconsciously, by Griffin Bell in testimony earlier this week. Mr. Bell, President Carter's attorney general, is one more Democrat the White House has found to assert that Judge Bork is just a harmless moderate. Discussing the growing opposition to the nomination, Mr. Bell growled: &quot;If we pick Supreme Court justices by what the people want, we are going to be in bad shape.&quot; Not a great argument for a nominee whose major claim to the seat is that he will honor the wishes of the majority.    Maybe Mr. Bell is a mole, too.    ---   Mr. Kinsley edits The New Republic. </TEXT></DOC>
