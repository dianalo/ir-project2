The legislation on President Bush's desk would reduce to one day_ from as many as seven days _ the grace period allowed beforelarge employers have to deposit withheld taxes.   Congressional economists estimate the change, which takes effectAug. 1, would save the government $2.45 billion in the last twomonths of the budget year ending Sept. 30. That's more than twicethe size of the next-largest revenue increase in the bill.   Two far smaller parts of the bill also rely on accelerating taxcollections. One affects the airline industry, which collects the 8percent tax on passenger tickets; the other requires gasolinewholesalers to make quicker payments of the 9.1-cent-a-gallongasoline tax.   ``The idea is that somebody is collecting a tax for thegovernment and the issue is how quickly they should deposit it intothe federal coffers,'' said Sam Starr, a partner in the Washingtonoffice of Coopers andamp; Lybrand accountants.   The payroll-tax change will affect only those employers thathave collected more than $100,000 of Social Security and incometaxes in a given period.   ``That's not going to hit the Mom-and-Pop operations,'' Starrsaid. ``Perhaps those with 100 or 200 employees may be affected.''   David Burton, a tax specialist with the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce, sees the change becoming a burden for medium and largercompanies, especially those that have more than one plant or outlet.   ``Obviously they will be denied a small float,'' the temporaryuse of withheld taxes, Burton said. ``But the problem comes becausethey will be forced to make deposits before they can calculate howmuch they really owe.''   Burton said many companies with multiple outlets will have tomake the federal tax deposit a day or two before they can collectrecords of how many hours were worked during the pay period orexactly how many people were on the payroll.   Under present law, a month is divided into eight deposit periodsof three or four days each. In general, an employer has threebanking days to make a deposit if at the end of any of thoseperiods the company has undeposited taxes of $3,000 or more.   Under the bill, an employer would have to make a deposit thenext banking day _ regardless of where that fell in the eightdeposit periods _ after collected taxes totaled more than $100,000.   The bill applies to income taxes and Social Security taxeswithheld from workers' checks, as well as to an employer's matchingshare of Social Security taxes.   A company with 200 workers averaging $20,000 a year would not beaffected by the new rule. However, one with 250 employees at thesame average would be hit, assuming the workers had income taxeswithheld at a 15 percent rate. The combined employer-employeeSocial Security tax rate next year will be 15.3 percent.   Burton sees this year's legislation as ``the nose under thetent.'' The next time Congress is looking for a painlessrevenue-raiser, he predicts, the lawmakers will cut the $100,000threshold, ``and eventually it's going to get down to the reallysmall employer.''</TEXT></DOC>
