A police spokesman said 20 people were killed and 42 woundedsince the non-stop bombardment of the city and surrounding hillsbegan at dusk Saturday.   That brought the casualty toll to 147 killed and 481 wounded,nearly all civilians, since the battle began March 8 between theChristian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and Druse militiamenbacked by Syrian troops.   A lull at midday Monday allowed people to leave undergroundshelters for the first time in 40 hours. They replenished stocks offood, powdered milk, water and tranquilizers, then rushed back tobunkers.   ``This is driving me crazy,'' said Paula Trad, a Christianuniversity student who lives in east Beirut's Sin el-Fil district.``How long can people take it?''   Sources at Aoun's headquarters said his U.S.-trained 8th Brigadein Souk el-Gharb repulsed Syrian tank assaults on the desertedmountain resort with armor-piercing rockets.   It was the Syrians' ``first tank assault ... to test the 8th,''a source said privately. ``They seem to be preparing for all-outonslaught.''   Souk el-Gharb, 15 miles southeast of Beirut, overlooks roadsleading from the Druse-controlled Chouf Mountains to Christianterritory.   In Washington, the State Department accused both sides of``reckless disregard'' for human life and called for an immediatecease-fire.   A Lebanese militia chieftain who has stayed out of the fightsaid leaders of 20 Moslem and leftist militias would meet Wednesdaywith an Arab League committee about how to end the confrontation.Nabih Berri of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal made the announcementin the Syrian capital.   Chances of an immediate settlement collapsed Monday when Aoun,who also heads a Christian military cabinet, rejected a suggestionby Premier Salem Hoss, leader of the competing Moslem government,that both resign.   An aide, speaking anonymously by telephone, quoted Aoun assaying: ``That wouldn't work. It's nonsense.''   Hoss made the suggestion Sunday in a plea for the factions to``stop shooting at once; stop the bloodbath, stop the massacre.''   ``If Gen. Aoun and myself have become the two sides of the coinin the current crisis, then we had better rid our country andpeople of this problem,'' he said in a broadcast on Moslem radiostations.   Abdulla Rassi, interior minister in the Hoss cabinet, toldreporters Monday: ``We're at a loss. We can't find a way out ofthis horrific, vicious circle.''   He proposed a joint Christian and Moslem military committee ofthe fractured Lebanese army to pursue ways of securing andmonitoring a cease-fire.   Aoun insists any such committee include the Syrian army and havea mandate to enforce a truce and set a timetable for Syrianwithdrawal from Lebanon.   A political crisis that began in September led to the twogovernments and division of the army on sectarian lines. Aoun leadsthe 20,000 Christian troopers and the 22,000 Moslems, poorlyequipped, are commanded by Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib.   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a peacekeepingmandate from the Arab League granted in 1976, a year after thecivil war began, and has become the country's main power broker.Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive the Syrians out.   Fighting began two days after Aoun's forces imposed an air-seablockade March 6 on illegal ports run by militias, which cost thegovernment's five legal ports on the 130-mile coast an estimated$100 million a year in revenue.   Walid Jumblatt's Druse militia responded with artillery fire,soon joined by Syrian gunners, and the Syrians and Khatib's Moslemarmy troops blockaded the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northand east of Beirut.   Aoun's blockade continues, covering four ports run by Moslemmilitias and a northern port operated by former President SuleimanFranjieh's Marada Party. Sources close to Franjieh have said he waswilling to hand it over to Aoun but the Syrians, who control thearea, would not permit it.   Gunboats raked the Druse port of Jiye with machine-gun fire atmidnight Sunday and again before dawn, police said, but no reportson casualties or damage were available.   Jiye, 15 miles south of Beirut, is the main port operated byJumblatt, whose militia that controls the central mountains and theChouf region.   Police said Moslem gunners had fired 10,000 shells sinceSaturday into the enclave where 1 million Christians live, andAoun's men rained 4,300 rounds on Moslem west Beirut, the centralmountains and the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon.   President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun to lead an interimgovernment when Gemayel's six-year term ended in September andParliament could not agree on a succesor. Moslems rejected theappointment and swore allegiance to Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who servedunder Gemayel.   By unwritten agreement since independence from France in 1943,Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier Sunni and theparliament speaker Shiite Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
