Foleytold reporters outside the White House after a meeting withPresident Bush.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the coup raises concerns aboutU.S. aid for the Philippines, especially as the two nations enternegotiations for the future of the major U.S. bases there.   ``We're obviously concerned about what that money's going to bespent on, what the government's going to be there,'' said Leahy.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said this was the best organized coupto date. ``Our intelligence shows us if they keep stepping it upgrade by grade, she will be in deep trouble,'' he said.   Simpson noted that Congress has been considering aid of up to$1.6 billion, including benefits for Philippine war veterans, aspart of the price of renewing base leases.   A senior adminstration official said Wedneday that despiteputting down the coup, Mrs. Aquino's political future appearsuncertain.   ``She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' said theofficial, adding that Mrs. Aquino should ``take seriously whathappened.''   Asked about those comments today, White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said, ``On the record, we would not speculate on'' Mrs.Aquino's future. He acknowledged that the United States hasconcerns about the situation and certain Philippine policies, ``butthat does not diminish the fact that we support her and hergovernment and we hope that they're successful.''   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said ``Mrs.Aquino's government has shown incredible resilience in thissituation,'' and he restated ``our very strong support for her.''   Setting a more optimistic tone than the senior official, Bouchersaid pessimism surrounded a coup attempt in 1987, but that thePhillipines rebounded rapidly and continued its economic growth.   The United States now expects ``that the Philippine people canpull together under President Aquino's leadership'' to achieve asimilar recovery from the latest unrest, he said.   The official, briefing a small group of reporters Wednesday onthe condition that he not be identified further, apparently wasseeking to send a clear message to Mrs. Aquino's U.S.-backedgovernment to become more responsive to criticism within hercountry.   Mrs. Aquino's future may depend on her ability to ``eliminatethe sources of discontent,'' the official said.   Uneasiness among the Philippine population in general, andwithin the military in particular, is a sure sign of trouble ``andas a political leader she has to deal with it,'' the official said.   Asked if Mrs. Aquino could survive politically, the officialsaid: ``That's a tough one.''   He spoke as the coup attempt _ the sixth since she took officein 1986 _ seemed to be running out of steam. Rebel forces who hadfortified themselves in Manila's Makati business district returnedvoluntarily to their barracks Thursday.   However, it remained unclear whether the announcement marked theend of the coup.   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 woundedsince Friday.   Earlier, U.S. officials praised as ``careful and effective'' aPhilippine evacuation that freed 280 Americans and other foreigncitizens from the Manila hotels where they had been trapped bygunfire in the 7-day-old rebellion.   ``We commend the Aquino government for organizing and carryingout this operation,'' said State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler, applauding the ``careful and effective manner in which itdealt with the situation in the Makati commercial district and theefforts it took to safeguard American citizens and others who werein the area.''   The senior administration official said that, with U.S. militaryhelp, Mrs. Aquino had appeared to survive ``an almost-successfulcoup,'' correcting himself to say ``a serious attempted coup.''   In any event, he said, ``I think that if she takes seriouslywhat happened and tries to eliminate the sources of discontentwhich helped lead to the coup, it may come out'' all right for her.   ``We really have to reassess what all this means.''   Asked to elaborate, he said: ``We have to assess what this hasdone and the American assistance in terms of the situation. Peoplewill use the fact that she called on America against her.''   President Bush heeded Mrs. Aquino's plea for help last Friday,sending F-4 fighter jets from Clark Air Base screaming over two airfields held by rebels, preventing the insurgents from using thosefields to launch additional attacks.   The United States gave $650 million to the Aquino governmentthis year, the third largest foreign aid package, behind onlyIsrael and Egypt. The United States maintains two bases in thePhilippines, Clark and the sprawling Subic Bay naval base.   U.S. leases on both bases expire in 1991, and the attempted coupseriously complicates efforts to renegotiate those leases. For thetime being, lease talks have been put on hold.</TEXT></DOC>
