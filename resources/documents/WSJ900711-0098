In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose140.96 points to 32293.39.   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 350million shares, down from 401.7 million shares Monday.Decliners markedly outnumbered advancers 727 to 220, while171 issues were unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in thefirst section fell 24.64 points, or 1.04%, to 2337.77.   The second section index dropped 10.05 points, or 0.24%,to 4387.67.   Investors noted that general profit-taking had been duefor the second section, which had risen a total of 286.14points, or 6.99%, since June 25.   Yesterday's volume in the section was estimated at 40.1million shares, down from 45.8 million shares Monday.   Early morning rumors in Sydney's foreign-exchange marketthat the Bank of Japan may raise its official discount ratesoon had little impact on the Tokyo markets during themorning, traders said.   But in the afternoon, Tokyo stock and bond marketsweakened on news that U.S. investment advisory firm SmickMedley International predicted Sunday that the Japanesecentral bank is highly likely to raise its discount rate overthe next several months.   The firm argued that the issue isn't on the principle ofraising rates but rather on the timing. &quot;There is now an 80%to 90% chance the Bank of Japan will raise interest ratesover the next several months,&quot;the firm said in a report.   &quot;Obviously, the report is having a big impact on the(stock) market,&quot; said Greg Byndy, manager of equity tradingat Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. Particularly because of the stockmarket's thin volume, the report effectively squeezed pricesas participants tried to discount the news, Mr. Byndy said.   The dollar, which had already been weaker against the yen,fell further after talk on the report hit the markets,although observers emphasized that bearishness on the dollarstems more from uncertainty about the outcome of this week'sHouston economic summit of seven leading industrializednations.   But the bond market came off amid the Smick Medley news,with the yield on the benchmark, the No. 119, 4.8% coupon of1999, rising to 7.255%, up 5.5 basis points, or hundredths ofa percentage point, at the Tokyo Stock Exchange close.   As the stock market continues its sluggishness whiledigesting currency and interest-rate speculation, programtrading and selective institutional participation outside ofthe first section has been predominant, traders noted.   In the morning, spotty, index-linked selling was canceledout by light program buying, while a mixed amount of bothlater in the day had a somewhat neutral impact on the NikkeiIndex, observers said.   Futures were trading at a reasonably large spread to thecash index for most of the day, traders noted.   Institutions have generally stayed clear of the stimulatedfluctuations on the broad market, moving instead to thesecond section, over-the-counter, and other major cityindexes.   While these markets have vigorously recovered frompost-crash lows of early April, traders stressed that they'resusceptible to tremendous volatility.   Holding up well yesterday were pharmaceuticals, a typicalsafe play when the yen's direction is uncertain, and someretail and manufacturing shares.   Chugai Pharmaceutical gained 50 yen to 1680 yen (33 centsto $11.11), Banyu rose 40 yen to 1310 yen, and Yoshitomi rose30 yen to 1830 yen.   Ito-Yokado rose 10 yen to 4070 yen, and Noritake rose 60yen to 1680 yen.   Uni Charm rose 20 yen to 2300 yen, Wacoal rose 10 yen to1440 yen, Kao Corp. added 20 yen to 1590 yen, and Lion rose 2yen to 983 yen.   Although Kyocera and Sony were hit by profit-taking, otherhigh-technology shares managed to sustain small gains.   TDK rose 10 yen to 7370 yen, Pioneer Electronic added 10yen to 6380 yen, and Aiwa added 30 yen to 2430 yen.   Kyocera fell 140 yen to 8760 yen, while Sony fell 110 yento 8700 yen.   Big losers included securities firms and banks, steel andshipbuilding shares.   In London, one trader blamed the market's drop on WallStreet's lower opening. &quot;We were looking for a rise in WallStreet but it didn't happen,&quot; the trader said.   The day's main feature was sterling's continued strength,with the pound quoted as high as $1.8270 early in thesession.   This strength caused a number of U.K. stocks with heavyoverseas earnings to be downgraded by analysts, dragging theentire market lower. Among those to be singled out wereGlaxo, ICI, Reuters and Racal.   Volume was moderate with 440.7 million shares changinghands, compared with 387.3 million issues Monday.
