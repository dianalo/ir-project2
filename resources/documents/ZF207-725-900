Model60, Finders is about 360K in size and will run on MS-DOS-compatible machineswith at least 256K RAM.andM;The ERS also has outfitted its secretaries with Finders so they can use it todirect people calling for information to the right people at ERS.andP;  &quot;They feelmuch more comfortable answering the phone,&quot; Horsfield said, &quot;because theydon't have to keep all this knowledge in their head because they know theycan retrieve it very quickly&quot; from their PC using Finders.andM;Often one of the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of developing anexpert system is creating the knowledge base, or the database that containsthe information and structure for accessing it.andP;  This usually involvessystems developers interviewing experts in the particular field.andP;  In the ERS'case, the expert was also the system developer.andM;&quot;We were sort of lucky in this case,&quot; Horsfield said.andP;  &quot;In a sense, I was myown expert as I developed the system.andP;  It's a little bit harder when thesystem developer is not the expert, because then you have to sit down withthe experts and extract their decision rules and the processes by which theyprovide advice.andM;&quot;In our case, that was quite simple.andP;  We knew the answers.andP;  What we had to dowas to structure a set of menus that would relate the answers to the type ofquestions that people always ask, like, 'Who can I talk to?'andP;  That's always abig one, so you have to provide them with a series of steps that lead themvery logically to the person they want,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
