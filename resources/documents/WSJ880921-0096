Mitchell (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CON ENV </IN><TEXT>   A group of asbestos plaintiffs is seeking to place Raymark Industries Inc. into involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.    The plaintiffs, three former Du Pont Co. employees who were exposed to asbestos in their work in a Delaware plant, filed the petition in U.S. bankruptcy court in Reading, Pa.    Last November, they were awarded $743,000 in compensatory damages by a Delaware state court jury in a suit against Raymark and other former asbestos producers. The jury also added $75 million in punitive damages against Raymark, saying the company had conspired to hide the deadly effects of asbestos.    Raymark, a Lancaster, Pa.-based maker of friction products, asked the bankruptcy court to dismiss the action, saying the plaintiffs have no standing to file the petition and no grounds on which to base it. The company also charged that the filing was made in bad faith and asked the bankruptcy court to award unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.    Supporting the petition is a group of plaintiffs attorneys upset with Raymark's ironclad refusal to settle claims for more than small amounts -- recently an average of $76. Raymark, which is facing about 38,000 asbestos lawsuits, has instead battled the claims in court, which has cost the company about $2.5 million a month in legal fees. The attorneys also want the court to determine if Raymark has fraudulently shuttled assets out of the company.    Raymark has repeatedly said it hasn't illegally transferred any assets.    In a memorandum supporting its filing, the plaintiffs said an affidavit by Raymark's former president, Craig Smith, showed the company &quot;is hopelessly insolvent&quot; because of its asbestos liability and that it had unpaid defense costs of $10.6 million as of June 1.    Raymark is a unit of Litigation Control Corp., which is controlled by Mr. Smith.    According to bankruptcy law, a petition for involuntary bankruptcy must be filed by at least three creditors with valid claims worth at least $5,000 more than any security held on the claim, and they must prove that the company generally isn't paying debts as they come due. An amendment to the Bankruptcy Code in 1984 also holds that the claims can't be &quot;the subject of a bona fide dispute.&quot;    Raymark, in its motion to dismiss the petition, argued that the $75 million judgment is still the subject of dispute because the company has appealed the decision. Also, the company said, the Delaware court ruled that a $10 million bond posted by Raymark provided plaintiffs with adequate security. The company also said it is paying its day-to-day debts as they come due. </TEXT></DOC>
