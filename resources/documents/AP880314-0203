The civil fines of $25,000 per vessel involved are the maximumallowed under U.S. law.   ``This underscores how seriously we viewed the violations,'' JimBrennan, a deputy general counsel for NOAA, said Monday. He saidthe Japanese companies can seek an administrative hearing on thefines if they decide to appeal.   Northwest congressmen, who had criticized the Reaganadministration's handling of the fishing situation, were pleasedwith the fines.   ``This action should send a powerful message to any fishermanwho is thinking about fishing illegally in our waters,'' said Rep.Don Bonker, D-Wash.   Added Rep. John Miller, R-Wash.: ``If these fines make itdangerous to fish illegally in our waters and if these fines makeit expensive for outlaw fishing vessels if they get caught, then Iam all for them.''   The fines were based on a review of the videotapes anddepositions taken from commercial fishermen who chartered a planeand photographed the vessels with their nets down allegedly 38miles inside the American fishing zone, said Brennan.   The investigation was conducted by a NOAA lawyer in Juneau,Alaska, and the fines issued late last week.   Two of the vessels videotaped are owned and operated by HamayaSuisan Co., Ltd., which was fined a total of $50,000, said Brennan.The other two vessels are owned and operated by Senkon Gyogyo Co.,Ltd., and Taisei Gyogyo Co., Ltd., Those companies each were fined$25,000.   In addition, the owners and operators of two unidentifiedfishing vessels that were also videotaped were fined a total of$100,000. The identification numbers on the vessels were covered atthe time they were photographed.   Those fines were for illegal fishing and for having theiridentifying marks obscured.   ``We expect we will get the cooperation of the Japanesegovernment in tracking those vessels,'' said Brennan.   Brennan also said NOAA was considering denying applications forpermits from the three companies to fish in American waters until1992.   Foreign vessels are not currently allowed to fish in the200-mile U.S. zone off Alaska, but they are allowed to participatein joint ventures with American firms. Brennan said the denial ofpermits would bar the three Japanese firms from participating injoint ventures.   American fishermen and the U.S. Coast Guard have suspected formore than a year that foreign trawlers were slipping into the U.S.zone under cover of darkness or in stormy weather to fish illegally.   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans andfisheries, said Monday he was not aware of the NOAA fines anddeclined comment.</TEXT></DOC>
