It is difficult to obtain sufficiently usefuldecay diagrams of short lived nucleides. High-energy levels are oftenmissing in inferior decay diagrams, leading to an overestimation of theintensity of beta-rays at low-energy levels. Such an overestimation orunderestimation due to the inferiority of a decay diagram is referredto as pandemonium effect. The pandemonium effect can be assessed by meansof the ratio of the measured energy of the highest level of the daughternuclide to the Q/sub {beta}/-value of the beta-decay. When a satisfactorydecay diagram cannot be obtained, the average decay energy has to beestimated by theoretical calculation. The gross theory for beta-decayproposed by Yamada and Takahashi is employed for the calculation. Tocarry out the calculation according to this theory, it is required todetermine the value for the parameter Q/sub 00/, the lowest energy ofthe daughter nuclide that meets the selection rule for beta-decay. Currently,Q/sub 00/ to be used for this purpose is estimated from data on the energyof the lowest level found in a decay diagram, even if it is inferior.Some examples of calculation of decay heat using the average beta- orgamma-ray energy are shown and compared with measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
