SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tens of thousands of Solidarity supportersshouted ``Down with communism!'' and turned a May Day march into arally for union-backed candidates in the coming National Assemblyelections.   ``We have been walking to this rally for eight years, but wefinally made it,'' said Maciej Jankowski, a Solidarity activistfrom Warsaw University. ``Today has shown how many we are, but wecan't just be strong on holidays.''   Like the Solidarity supporters reveling in their movement'sreinstatement after a seven-year ban and government concessionsincluding a promise of free elections, thousands of workers aroundthe world gathered Monday on the international labor day tocelebrate gains or demonstrate for change.   The Soviet Union held a traditional parade through Red Square,and China's leaders used speeches and editorials to urge socialstablility in the face of student protests for democratic reforms.   But in South Korea, rallies became riots. Police also clashedwith demonstrators in two Polish cities as well as in Turkey, thePhilippines and Czechoslovakia.   Up to 100,000 union supporters filled a field at the foot ofWarsaw's Old Town to hear city Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujakpresent the union movement's candidates for the June elections tothe Sejm, the lower house of parliament, and the Senate.   Popular actor Andrzej Lapicki, a Sejm candidate, drew a roar ofapproval when he said: ``I am sure in voting for me, you are votingfor Solidarity.''   But, he added, ``If you don't vote out of laziness, you aremaking the Communists happy.''   Authorities scaled back official celebrations.   Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski told about20,000 loyalists gathered at Victory Square that socialism wasreturning to its ``purest values'' thanks to party-backed reforms.   Party officials also organized meetings at cafes in Warsaw wherecitizens could discuss politics and the battered economy withgovernment officials.   Before the Solidarity rally, about 30,000 people sang andchanted as they marched through Warsaw to the waves and smiles ofonlookers who gathered in windows and on balconies.   Solidarity, banned after the martial-law crackdown in December1981, was legalized April 5 under an agreement in which authoritiesagreed to at least partially share power with the opposition in thefirst such arrangement in the Soviet bloc.   In at least two cities, police used force to break up rallies bymilitant Solidarity splinter groups. Police attacked protesters inthe Baltic port of Gdansk and used tear gas and clubs againststone-throwing youths in the southern city of Wroclaw, activistssaid.   Riot police in South Korea fired tear gas in a battle with about5,000 striking workers in Masan and nearby Changwon afterprotesters tried to stage a May Day rally, police said. About 200workers were arrested.   In the Philippines, police swung truncheons and fired tear gasto break up crowds marching to the U.S. Embassy in Manila after arally in which union leaders threatened a nationwide strike topress for a higher minimum wage.   In Czechoslovakia, at least 76 people were arrested for takingpart in anti-government protests during the official May Day paradein Prague.   Reporter Misha Glenny of the British Broadcasting Corp. said hewas punched in the face and held for five hours as he recorded anarrest in Prague. Britain's Foreign Office said it would protest toCzechoslovakia.   In the Soviet Union, an activist in the Soviet republic ofArmenia said residents in the capital, Yerevan, defied a ban andheld a large, peaceful rally. May Day celebrations were banned inYerevan and Tbilisi, capital of Soviet Georgia, because of recentpro-independence unrest in the cities.   The mood was festive in Moscow under sunny skies during thetraditional May Day parade through Red Square. Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials stood atop Lenin's tomb asthousands of marchers waved colorful banners, pushed floats andfloated balloons.   In Turkey, an 18-year-old man died of a gunshot wound to thehead and 35 people were injured, including seven by gunfire, inbattles with security forces during outlawed marches in Istanbul,the Anatolia news agency reported. Officials banned the holidaybecause they said it was a Marxist tradition.   The slain man, Mehmet Ali Dalci, died today and had been in acoma since suffering the gunshot wound Monday, said Dr. MuhittinOkumus, director of Istanbul's Taksim Hospital.   In West Berlin, police used water cannon, tear gas andtruncheons against at least 2,000 protesters who hurled fire bombs,looted stores and smashed windows in violent skirmishes.   In communist East Berlin, at least five dissidents were arrestedfor staging demonstrations alongside official celebrations,opposition sources said.
