The blueprint from the National Center on Education and theEconomy also proposes extensive day care and early childhoodeducation and recommends second chances for adult workers who arefunctionally illiterate or lack adequate job skills.   ``To Secure Our Future: The Federal Role in Education'' comesthree years after the group, then known as the Carnegie Forum onEducation and the Economy, released ``A Nation Prepared: Teachersfor the 21st Century,'' a well-received plan to upgrade the teachingprofession.   Apple Computer president John Sculley chairs the center board andNew York Gov. Mario Cuomo is the honorary chairman. Other boardmembers include former North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, former LaborSecretary Ray Marshall and pollster Lou Harris.   Sculley, speaking to a news conference by telephone hookup, saidthe report has been presented to President Bush, White House chiefof staff John Sununu and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos.   He said he did not know whether any of the proposals would beincluded in an education bill now being drafted at the White House,but said Bush was ``extremely interested in what we had to say'' and``we do believe we have the president's ear in terms of howimportant it is for him to come out early in his term for massiveeducation reform.''   Center president Marc Tucker said at a news conference that thelatest report envisions ``a whole new intergovernmentalpartnership'' that doesn't necessarily involve more money.   ``First, go for quality,'' the report says. ``Second, rewardsuccess in producing quality. Third ... let the people on the firingline figure out how to get the job done and get rid of as much ofthe bureaucracy ... as possible.''   The report's major proposal is patterned on the process thatproduced the nation's new welfare law. That law reflects many of thesolutions developed by states during several years ofexperimentation when they were allowed to transfer federal moneyfrom existing programs to their own innovative projects,unencumbered by many rules, regulations and red tape.   The center recommends ``a very large experiment that wouldprovide the information needed for a general redrafting of the basicfederal programs later.''   School districts could design initiatives to improve studentperformance, ease the transition from school to work for potentialdropouts, or coordinate social services for disadvantaged students,the report says. The money would come from existing programs in thelabor, education, justice and health and human services departments.   Local communities, if their proposals were approved by state andfederal governments, ``would be free to combine the available stateand federal funds as they wish. ... They would continue to be freeof the prevailing rules and regulations as long as they were meetingthe (performance) targets they had set.''   In other areas, the center said:   _Bush should push the nation toward lofty math and scienceperformance goals in an all-out effort reminiscent of PresidentKennedy's space exploration program. Tucker said Bush should``identify the best performance anywhere in the world and resolve asa nation to meet it or beat it.'' The report suggests severalstrategies, including a revamped curriculum and a national center toteach teachers technology.   _State, federal and local agencies need to combine resources forhigh-quality fulltime day care, preschool child development centersand before and after school care programs so kids don't ``enterkindergarten as damaged goods, already marked for failure.''   _The country must stop treating adult illiteracy as a personalmisfortune ``rather than the threat to the nation's standard ofliving that it really is.'' The problem can't be solved byvolunteers, nor can employers be expected to foot the whole bill.</TEXT></DOC>
