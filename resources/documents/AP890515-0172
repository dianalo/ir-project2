A department spokesman, Richard Boucher, also dismissed reportsthe United States was working out a compromise with West Germany,which opposes the modernization program for the 88 Lance launchersand their 700 or so missiles.   ``I don't see any sort of compromise shaping up, but we arecertainly continuing discussions,'' the U.S. official said.   Boucher said President Bush was in touch with West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl and that Gerhard Stoltenberg, the WestGerman defense minister, probably would be here on Friday forfurther talks.   In contrast to the U.S. criticism, Secretary of State James A.Baker III saluted the economic reforms undertaken by SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ``truly revolutionary.''   Baker, who was in Moscow last week, said Soviet leaders were``singing out of our hymn book.''   Appearing at a session Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., arrangedwith some constitutents, Baker said warmer relations between theSoviet Union and China were not of concern to the West and couldenhance world stability.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, visiting Bonn onSaturday, warned that if the United States did not drop plans tomore than triple the range of the Lance missiles to more than 250miles the Soviet Union would respond by developing a newshort-range weapon or by retaining SS-23s, which have a range ofabout 310 miles.   The treaty, signed here in December 1987 by then-PresidentReagan and Gorbachev, provided for the destruction of all U.S. andSoviet nuclear missiles in the intermediate range _ from 300 to3,500 miles.   On Sunday, Baker said Shevardnadze's threat to suspenddestruction of SS-23 missiles would violate the 1987 treaty andcould be part of a publicity campaign to divide the North AtlanticTreaty Organization.   ``This is a matter that was specifically negotiated when the INFTreaty was negotiated,'' Baker said.   ``The elimination of the SS-23s on the part of the Soviet Union... was debated back and forth for quite some time. The Sovietsresponded in effect that they would agree to eliminate thesemissiles, and now they are doing so,'' Baker said Sunday on theCBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.''   On Monday, the State Department, through Boucher, stepped up theattack, saying ``we think Shevardnadze's remarks are an outlandishstatement. One day the Soviets announce small unilateralreductions, the next day they are talking about breaking a recentlyconcluded treaty.''   The U.S. official apparently was referring to Gorbachev'sannouncement last Thursday while meeting with Baker in Moscow thatthe Soviets would withdraw 500 short-range nuclear warheads fromEastern Europe.   Baker publicly described the move as a ``modest'' one, designedin part for public relations. He said the Warsaw Pact held asizable advantage over the United States in short-range missilesand had modernized most of them.   During negotiations that preceded the 1987 treaty the Sovietsresisted including the SS-23s, but relented. They have 200 missilesin the category. All are supposed to be destroyed by Dec. 1, andnone have been so far, said a U.S. official, who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   Boucher said the SS-23s undoubtedly were covered by the 1987treaty and short-range missiles were not covered. He said ``a lookat the text'' would confirm the U.S. position.   ``We find it especially ironic that the Soviets threaten tobreak the INF treaty in an effort to pressure the West onshort-range systems which they have just finished modernizing andwhere they hold at least a 12-1 advantage over the West,'' thespokesman said.   The Soviet Union began deploying the SS-23-Spider in 1985 as areplacement for the 1960s-vintage SCUD missile.   Boucher said the Soviets had no legal right to choose not toobserve part of the treaty.   The United States, under Reagan, decided not to observe variouslimits of the 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, but Bouchersaid that accord had not been ratified by the Senate.   ``It's clearly not a welcome development that the Soviets shouldthreaten to break treaties which have already been negotiated andconcluded,'' he said. ``I would hope the Soviets would think verylong and hard before they did something like this, but it'scertainly not helpful their making statements like this.''   Asked if the Bush administration was engaged now in a publicrelations war with Moscow, the spokesman said: ``No, we're not.''</TEXT></DOC>
