As talks between the two campaigns continued, Jackson called onhis delegates to be disciplined for the four-day convention,warning he might contest Dukakis every step of the way.   ``If you have a quarter that was all smooth, it would becounterfeit. There has to be some indentation and there has to besome debate and deliberation to arrive at a consensus,'' Jacksonsaid on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''   Jackson called Dukakis on Sunday morning for another privatetelephone talk on the day the Massachusetts governor headed toAtlanta.   ``I did it to keep lines of communication open,'' Jackson told anews conference in the afternoon.   Dukakis confirmed the call, but neither man would reveal thedetails.   ``We talked on the telephone this morning,'' Dukakis said.``We'll probably be talking a little later this evening, and I'msure we're going to be meeting during the course of theconvention.''   Dukakis aides said the governor had scrapped at least part ofhis Monday morning schedule, and later Dukakis spokesman DaytonDuncan announced the two would meet privately Monday at 8:30 a.m.at Dukakis' campaign hotel.   Sources who asked not to be identified by name said that Dukakisand Jackson were negotiating several issues, including Jackson'sdemand to play a significant role in a transition effort in forminga Democratic administration if Dukakis is elected in November.Dukakis sources said it would be better to deal with the issueafter the election.   These sources also said Jackson is seeking the right to appointtwo or three dozen at-large members to the Democratic NationalCommittee, a step that would increase his clout in the partystructure.   Dukakis' rival also wants an agreement outlining an officiallysanctioned role in the fall campaign, including financial supportfrom Dukakis. It was not clear whether Jackson had explicitly askedDukakis to provide him with a charter jet of his own.   A Dukakis source said the Dukakis camp would welcome campaignefforts by Jackson, particularly in voter registration, but thatany funds would have to come from the party.   In addition, the two sides were discussing unresolved platformissues, although these did not appear to be the main stumblingblock toward a unity agreement.   Dukakis was said to be insistent that party chairman Paul Kirkremain in his post as long as he wants.   Apart from the negotiations with Jackson, Dukakis was said to beconsidering a plan to appoint a transition planning office in thedays immediately after he leaves Atlanta. One name mentioned as apotential head of the effort was Marcia Hale, who has played a keyrole in organizing the convention for the Massachusetts governor.   ``There can be no final resolution until there is mutual trustand respect and a feeling of comfort which can only grow from aface-to-face meeting,'' said Jackson convention manager Ron Brown.   ``We expect there will be a meeting. The time hasn't beendetermined,'' said Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas after atwo-hour afternoon meeting with Jackson aides.   California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a Jackson aide, saidthe talks were proceeding in a ``pleasant'' vein.   At a series of campaign stops across the convention city,Jackson kept up the pressure on Dukakis.   ``This is not a coronation. This is a convention,'' he toldseveral hundred cheering labor delegates in a sweltering hotel roomwhere the temperature topped 100 degrees.   ``We're not threatening to leave the convention. We're talkingabout threatening to stay,'' he told the delegates.   Jackson made it clear that he is not ready simply to allowDukakis and his forces to have a smooth, debate-free conventionstarting Monday.   ``The fact is minority planks will be debated and deliberatedupon and decided by the convention,'' Jackson said. ``Our minorityplanks are majority positions. For example, most Americans do notwant any more taxes on the middle class and poor people, butcorporations and the wealthy must pay their share.''   Told that Dukakis doesn't want a call for higher taxes in theplatform and that ``It's supposed to be his convention,'' Jacksonquickly responded:   ``That's an illusion. This is a convention of the people. It'sthe delegates' convention. They will determine who the nominee willbe. They will determine what planks will be agreed upon.''   At a Baptist church, Jackson vowed to press on.   ``Our time is upon us now,'' he told more than 1,000 people atthe service. ``We're fighting the right fight. We've come a longway. Don't you surrender. ... You cannot have new life without somepain.''   With the crowd, he chanted: ``Never surrender! Never surrender!''   But he warned them to be mature and disciplined.   ``Don't make Friday decisions on Sunday. Don't decide whatyou're going to do until the votes are cast,'' he said.   Dukakis called Jackson a valued member of the party's team, buthe made it clear in Boston who was headed for the Democraticpresidential nomination and who was not.   ``You can't have two quarterbacks,'' Dukakis said.   There was sense that an agreement needed to be reached quickly,before the convention officially opens Monday night.   ``Time is short. Our convention opens tomorrow,'' said Jacksonconvention manager Brown.   Kirk O'Donnell, a Dukakis adviser, added: ``Very definitelythere is an appreciation of a sense of urgency and there is adesire for unity.''   But Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's delegate inCongress and a Jackson delegate, said, ``I think it has not yetdawned on the Dukakis campaign how important it is that there be agenuine partnership and shared responsibility for achievingvictory.''   The candidates' words about each other were complimentary.   ``We know each other, we like each other, we respect eachother,'' Dukakis said.   ``Governor Dukakis and I have a good personal rapport. But thereare some unresolved matters,'' Jackson said. ``At this point, thereis no defined place for the progressive wing in the campaign. ...At this point, no role has been offered or accepted or defined inthe campaign beyond Atlanta.''   Even as Jackson suggested the fight could go on through the vicepresidential roll call on the convention's final night, he promisedthe party would leave Atlanta unified for the fall campaign againstRepublican George Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
