The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday ended a $79million contract with the Hazeltine Corp. to build 178 microwavelanding systems and said it will ask for new contractors' proposalslater this year.   The company was chosen in 1984 to build systems that are toreplace the instrument landing systems used for years at mostairports.   In a prepared statement, the FAA said engineering and productionproblems at the Commack, N.Y.,-based company have delayed theprogram by three years.   But the FAA said it remains committed to putting the newmicrowave landing systems at major U.S. airports in 1998 and at allairports around 2000.   Hazeltine has delivered two of the systems sought in thecontract. One has been installed at the Lebanon, N.H., airport.   The FAA said it will buy 26 systems from other sources, testthat equipment and then decide whether to move ahead. The FAA saidit plans to award a new contract in 1991.   Hazeltine, through its parent Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis,said it will sue over the FAA decision.   The microwave landing system is intended to give pilots greaterflexibility in their landing approaches at airports and helpairports increase their flight capacity.   The system uses high-frequency microwaves to direct planes tolandings, allowing them to make curved and steeper approachesoutside the strict paths necessary under the current system. Thesystem is virtually immune to weather hazards.   In its letter to Hazeltine, the FAA said the company has``failed to perform and deliver in accordance with the schedule ofthe subject contract.''   But Hazeltine blamed the government for production delays,saying problems involving payments and timing of deliveries werethe result of changes the FAA made in the contract after it wasawarded.   The agency had planned on putting new microwave systems at theLaconia and Manchester airports in New Hampshire, but FAA spokesmanJohn Leyden said that because of the delays it may put earlysystems at high-profile, high-volume airports such as John F.Kennedy International in New York.   The FAA plans to buy 750 of the new systems, if Congressapproves.</TEXT></DOC>
