(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 16,000 sailors and Marines beganleaving today for the Middle East as the Navy beefs up itsOperation Desert Shield forces.   The deployments of 17 ships from East Coast ports, includingeight from the huge Norfolk Naval Base, involved a rare same-daydeparture for two aircraft carriers, the USS America and the USSTheodore Roosevelt.   Several dozen tearful relatives lined the piers in a briskbreeze and drizzle as the destroyer USS Caron, one of the earliestships to leave, pulled out about 8 a.m.   Joseph Leyes, whose son, Louis, is an ensign aboard the Caron,said he felt a mixture of emotions: ``sad, excited, supportive,frightened.''   ``They're going to go out there; they're going to do a job;they're going to come back,'' he said.   Donna Beckum, whose husband, Larry, also is a Caron crewman,said her main concern was ``just how long they're going to begone.''   The Roosevelt and America, which were to sail early in theafternoon, will join three other carriers - the USS Kennedy, USSSaratoga and USS Ranger - already operating in the Middle East,where thousands of U.S. forces have been sent since Iraq invadedKuwait on Aug. 2.   The deployment of such a large number of U.S. warships to onepart of the world is unprecedented since the Vietnam war.   Capt. Charles S. Abbot, commanding officer of the Roosevelt,said his crew was prepared, though not eager, to leave home so soonafter the holiday.   ``There's really no discontent that I've observed,'' said Abbot,whose ship's last deployment was almost 18 months ago.   Still, Christmas was bittersweet for those shipping out andtheir families.   ``I'm happy he was here for Christmas, but I'm upset he'sleaving and not knowing when he's coming back,'' said CarmenKubala, whose husband, Dan, is an electrician aboard the America.   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the U.N. has set a Jan. 15deadline for it to withdraw or face possible military action. Navyofficials said the carriers will take about two weeks to get totheir destination.</TEXT></DOC>
