<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-79-0642 </DOCNO><TEXT>A 1/4 scale model of the UK Commercial Fast Reactor Diagrid has been constructedand tested. Theoretical predictions of the model and reactor flows wereobtained using the PHOENICS code. Comparison between experiment and codefor the behaviour of the model are discussed in terms of complex flowpatterns, overall pressure distributions, and velocity distributionsinto the outer row of support tubes where vibration assessments are essentialfor the reactor situation.</TEXT></DOC>
