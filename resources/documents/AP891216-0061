A vehicle carrying the interior minister, Zaki Badr, wasapproaching the club when the explosion occurred, and police onmotorcycles captured a man who ran from the pickup truck thatexploded, the officials said.   The captured man was the only person injured in the blast.   The state-owned Middle East News Agency said the truck explodedwhile the vehicle carrying the minister was passing by. The reportalso said the driver of the booby-trapped truck carried forgedidentification.   As interior minister, Badr has led an iron-fisted governmentcrackdown on Moslem militants since 1986. He is responsible forEgypt's internal security.   Militant Moslem fundamentalists attempted to kill two of hispredecessors in 1987. One suffered serious injuries, but the otherescaped unhurt.   Badr, a 63-year-old Moslem, joined the Cabinet in 1986 afterpolice recruits, allegedly encouraged by religious extremists, wenton a two-day shooting rampage through wide areas of Cairo. He isknown for making outspoken attacks on Moslem radicals and localCommunists.   Around the time of the blast, police announced today that nearly500 Moslem fundamentalist militants were arrested in a securityoperation throughout the southern province of Assiut. The arrestscame after a street fight and shootout on Monday between militantsand police in the province.   Monday's clash occurred when police tried to stop a march by 300anti-government, Moslem militants from a mosque to the city center.   Security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity inkeeping with ministry practice, said today's explosion occurredshortly after 8 a.m. on a main street outside the Police SportingClub in Cairo's Abbassiya dictrict. Badr usually goes to the clubevery morning for jogging and massage.   They said the explosive-laden vehicle _ a stolen, orange-coloredpickup truck _ pulled up at the club minutes before Badr was toarrive.   ``The driver obviously had been watching the minister'smovements and knew about his daily trips to the club,'' oneofficial said. ``As the car exploded, he jumped out and ran despiteinjuries to his right side.''   Two policemen on motorcycle traveling ahead of Badr's limousinesaw the driver, gave chase and seized the suspect about 600 yardsfrom the explosion site, the officials said. The only detail theywould give about the driver is that he comes from Fayoum, insouthern Egypt.</TEXT></DOC>
