MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush said reports of his death had beengreatly exaggerated. His comeback may get the same treatment.   That's the way it is in the crucial, high-stakes, do-or-die,make-or-break, pick-a-cliche contests that begin the season ofcompetition for presidential nominations. Every state leaves anindelible imprint, until the next state votes.   That sometimes means as long as a week.   The early omens, circa 1988, point to a season of politicaltrench warfare, in which battle cries and claims to momentum yieldto a long, hard struggle to collect delegates, one state at a time,then one vote at a time, until they add up to a nominating majority.   One week after he became the Republicans' leading loser, Bushgained a solid comeback victory in the New Hampshire presidentialprimary Tuesday.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, third among Democrats inIowa, won easily in next-door New Hampshire, and said that put himon a winning path that leads South.   Sen. Bob Dole claimed satisfaction in second place, but it wasway before midnight when he stopped smiling and started snarling atBush.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Democratic victor in the Iowacaucuses, said runner up and 20 percent of the vote was a solidshowing _ and it was, to the extent that he out paced fellowMidwesterner Paul Simon for the second week running. ``This isn'thelping,'' the Illinois senator said in bow-tied understatement.   Sen. Simon polled 17 percent, three points and a good manydollars short. Simon said if he could have reversed that narrowedge it would have made ``a tremendous difference in raisingmoney,'' which is in dangerously short supply in his campaign.   For all of that, nobody was quitting outright, not even formerArizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, who got 5 percent and barely beat GaryHart. Babbitt said he'd talk with his supporters and figure outwhat to do next.   So, coming out of Iowa and New Hampshire, both political partieshave confirmed what they knew going in _ Bush is the man to beat inwhat looks like a two-way Republican contest, with Pat Robertsonlooking from the outside in.   The Democrats have yet to pick a face from the crowd. Dukakishas what edge there is because he is the most recent winner, but heis heading into difficult territory in the Southern primaries thatcome up on March 8, Super Tuesday. A victory next Tuesday inMinnesota would provide an undeniable boost.   To this point, for all the effort and money they have spent, thecontestants have succeeded in eliminating Alexander Haig from theRepublican running, and pushing Democrat Babbitt toward the exit.Neither of them had a chance in the first place.   Robertson, who embarrassed Bush in Iowa, slumped to last placein New Hampshire. The former television evangelist acknowledgedthat he'd come up short of his hopes, but said he wasn'tdiscouraged. ``My natural base is down in the South and that'swhere we go from here,'' Robertson said.   Rep. Jack Kemp ran third, with 13 percent. He said that made himthe winner in the competition to become the candidate of theconservative wing of the party. Or, as he later billed it, theprogressive conservative wing. He, too, said the South promised hima better lot.   Pete du Pont ran narrowly ahead of Robertson.   Democrats Jesse Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said they, too,were aiming southward. The black vote there is certain to boostJackson's showings. Gore decided to wait near his Tennessee basefor the rest of the field to come there. ``Super Tuesday is acompletely new ball game,'' he said.   But it is a game in which there will be enough conflictingmessages to enable most of the contestants to claim headway. All 20contests are not in the South. Dukakis' Massachusetts, and nextdoor Rhode Island will be holding primaries on March 8, among thehalf-dozen outside the Southern and border states.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter Mears, veteran political writer for TheAssociated Press, is now AP's Executive Editor.</TEXT></DOC>
