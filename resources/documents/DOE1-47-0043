Diffusion coefficientswere determined by fitting the mathematical models to the observed motionof the interfaces. This method allows the measurement of diffusion coefficientswithout the need to determine phase compositions and is therefore suitedto measurements at elevated pressures (reservoir conditions). Measureddiffusion coefficients are reported for CO/sub 2/ in pentane, decane,and hexadecane at 25{sup 0}C [77{sup 0}F] and pressures up to 6000 kPa[870 psia]). Limited measurements of CO/sub 2/ diffusion in Maljamarcrude oil are also described. In addition, results of measurements forthe diffusion of CO/sub 2/ in water are presented. These are the firstsuch measurements at high pressures (up to 6000 kPa [870 pisia]). Correlationsof diffusion coefficients in liquids at atmospheric pressure are shownto give reasonable estimates of diffusion coefficients for CO/sub 2/in fluids at reservoir conditions. Finally, the measured diffusion coefficientsand mathematical models are used to assess the impact of diffusive mixingon CO/sub 2/ floods at various length scales to examine the relationshipbetween laboratory-scale corefloods and field-scale displacements.</TEXT></DOC>
