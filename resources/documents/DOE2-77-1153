These techniques have been incorporated into acomputer program that has been developed to model the towing and sinkingoperations for a variety of barges and caissons under various user-specifiedconditions. Extensive analysis of wave-induced dynamics was performedfor a number of representative cases in which the relevant parameterswere systematically varied. A database was then created and used in themodel. The database was created for a systematic series of barges anda number of types of caissons, and the program considers the followingaspects of their behavior: stability, wave-induced motions and loads,drag, and forces in broken ice. Tug power, towline configuration andbehavior, and positioning ballast requirements are also considered. Thisvolume reviews the state of offshore caisson technology and towing techniques,and describes the development of the program in detail; software designand utilization are also outlined. 17 refs., 41 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
