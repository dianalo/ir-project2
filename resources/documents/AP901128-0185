(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A white policeman initially cleared ofwrongdoing in the slaying of a black teen-ager was charged withmanslaughter Wednesday in the killing that led to race rioting.   Gary Spath faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted ofreckless manslaughter in the Teaneck shooting of Phillip Pannell,16. Spath claimed Pannell was reaching for a weapon when he fired.   Witnesses disputed that claim, arguing that Pannell had hishands raised overhead in surrender when he was shot in the backApril 10. A report from a pathologist hired by the boy's familysupported that contention.   ``I know the truth in this matter,'' Spath said at a newsconference. ``One good thing about this is that the truth will comeout.''   The killing heightened racial tension in Teaneck, an ethnicallymixed suburb of about 39,000 residents across the Hudson River fromNew York City.   A candlelight vigil in memory of Pannell turned into a rampageApril 11 as dozens of youths overturned police cars, smashedwindows and looted stores.   Since then, Pannell supporters have held periodic marches, theRev. Jesse Jackson and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan havevisited the town, and police officers and other supporters ofSpath, 29, staged a large rally.   A grand jury initially declined to indict Spath, but AttorneyGeneral Robert Del Tufo sent the case to a second grand jurybecause of what he called flawed evidence presented to the firstpanel.   In a statement Wednesday, Tufo said the first panel ruled basedon ``incorrect forensic and medical conclusions and the majorerror, only detected late in the game, could not be properlycorrected.''   Critics, including many New Jersey police chiefs and Spath'slawyer, Robert Galantucci, claimed Del Tufo's motivations forkeeping the case alive were political.   ``This is an obvious example of the attorney general in thestate of New Jersey throwing a bone to a segment of thecommunity,'' Glantucci said. ``In the process, he's thrown officerSpath to the wolves, but that's only temporarily.''   In September, police chiefs across the state urged Gov. JimFlorio to replace Del Tufo with a special prosecutor. Floriodeclined.   ``The grand jury has completed its work,'' Florio said in astatement Wednesday. ``The matter now shifts to the courts whereall the evidence will be weighed and the process of justice willcontinue.''   Pannell's family, who lived in River Edge when the boy waskilled, welcomed the indictment.   ``Del Tufo gave us a fair chance,'' said Thelma Pannell, 36, thevictim's mother. ``No matter whether you're black or white, youhave a fair chance.''   ``It's a good sign that the grand jurors have decided that hisconduct has some blameworthiness,'' said Walter Nealy, a lawyerrepresenting the African Council, an organization ofAfrican-American groups that supported the Pannell family.   ``I think it's a hopeful sign that there was an indictment, butwe still have to monitor the rest of the criminal justice system inthis case,'' he said.   Officer Wayne Blanco, Spath's backup at the scene, has said hefrisked Pannell and felt a gun before the foot chase, and hasdenied that Pannell's arms were raised when he was shot.</TEXT></DOC>
