Paul Simon put his faltering Democraticpresidential bid on hold today and said ``I have no illusions thatthe nomination will come my way,'' but he kept a lock on hisdelegates in hopes he can wield influence at the July nominatingconvention.   ``In a year that has already seen many surprises, no one knowswhat twists and turns may develop between now and then,'' Simonsaid at a Washington news conference.   Simon said he would make a final decision on his candidacy afterthe last primaries on June 7. In the meantime, he said he willdevote his time to his duties as an Illinois senator.   He said by holding onto his delegates until the convention, hehoped to have some influence over who the party nominates. ``I wantto make sure this country does what it ought to do,'' he toldreporters.   He attributed his campaign's stall to his own failure toeffectively communicate his message of traditional Democraticphilosophy and advocacy of a legitimate role for government inbringing about social reforms. The campaign also was hampered by alack of money, he said, but added he will finish with only about$400,000 in debts.   Simon's quasi-withdrawal leaves just three Democrats in therace. His decision comes after months of poor showings; he won onlyhis home-state primary.   During his travels around the nation, Simon said he found``there really is a yearning across this good land for leadershipthat appeals to the noble in us, rather than the greed in us.''   ``Government is not the enemy,'' he said. ``Government is simplya tool that can be used wisely or unwisely. ... We can do better,my friends.''   He said problems like the arms race, unemployment, crime andinadequacies in health care and education ``are not the result ofacts of God, but the result of insensitive leadership, chosen by apeople who sometimes are not as caring nor as careful as they mightbe.''   In the statement, Simon minimized chances that he might seek thepresidency again in 1992. ``Running for president is a little liketaking an ice-cold shower,'' he said. ``It is a great one-timeexperience, but I have no yearning for a repeat performance.''   Simon, according to an aide, hoped to pick up additionaldelegates as an inactive candidate between now and the convention.   His decision ``reflects the reality of having lost a great manyprimaries and caucuses,'' said spokesman Terry Michael. ``It willgive those who supported Paul Simon (a chance) to have fullrepresentation at the convention.''   Simon's mother, Ruth, said Wednesday her son would remain anofficial candidate, although suspending his campaign, because ``toomany people have advised him to stay in.''   ``He's going to hang in there till the end,'' she said.   Mrs. Simon said the senator and his family would take a week'svacation.   Simon, who entered the race a year ago promising a return to``leadership rooted in the traditional values of our party,'' wasunable to put together a winning campaign formula.   He had a brief rendezvous with momentum prior to Iowa'sfirst-in-the-nation February caucuses, emerging on top in severalpolls of Iowa voters taken late in 1987, but things began to cooloff after Gary Hart re-entered the race in mid-December.   When Feb. 8 arrived, Simon finished a close second in Iowabehind Missouri congressman Richard Gephardt. A week later, he camein third in New Hampshire behind Michael Dukakis and Gephardt.   It was mostly downhill from there.   He placed third or worse in most primaries and caucuses and satout the Super Tuesday contests in 20 states. He has garnered 170.5delegates, compared with Dukakis' 740.55, Jesse Jackson's 704.55and Albert Gore's 394.8.   He did win last month's primary in his home state of Illinois,but was unable to build on that victory and claim the Midwest asSimon country, making poor showings in Michigan, Wisconsin andelsewhere in the region.   Simon, 59, is known for his trademark bow tie and liberal views.But on the campaign trail he portrayed himself as a``make-no-apologies Democratic nominee ... waging a fight for theheart and the soul of the Democratic party.''   ``I want a government that cares. I want a government that isresponsive to the needs of the less fortunate,'' he told voters.   He painted himself the modern equivalent of plain-talking HarryTruman, saying people are ``ready for something other than theslick, packaged product. We're ready for somebody who's going tolevel with us.''   He proposed long-term health care for the elderly, a publicworks program for the unemployed and new education initiatives, andpromised that as president he would balance the budget in threeyears.   That brought criticism from Democratic rivals who claimed Simonwas short on details when it came to explaining how he wouldsimultaneously finance expensive new programs and balance thebudget.   Gephardt in one debate said ``Simonomics is really Reaganomicswith a bow tie.'' He called Simon a ``promise-as-you-go Democrat.''   Simon, a first-term senator and four-time congressman, counteredsuch criticisms by claiming that too many Democrats ``have boughtinto the Republican mindset, which claims we can't afford to investin America's future.''</TEXT></DOC>
