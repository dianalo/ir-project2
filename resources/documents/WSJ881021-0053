Corporate takeover fever and a bond market rebound also helped stocks climb. The Dow Jones industrials soared 43.92 points to 2181.19, the biggest jump in almost two months.    It came on the anniversary of the day on which the market nearly disintegrated. Financial markets almost ground to a halt on Oct. 20, 1987; but later that day stocks shot up by more than 102 points.    In yesterday's less-explosive rally, more than half the gains came in the final half-hour of trading. &quot;Oil and bonds led the way, which in turn gave stocks more room to move up,&quot; said James H. Coxon, a senior vice president at Cigna Investment Group. Transportation stocks jumped after reports of new squabbling between Iran and Iraq over oil production quotas.    But RJR Nabisco Inc. jumped the highest. The stock leaped 21 1/4, nearly 38%, on news that the company is trying to arrange a $17 billion, management-led buy-out, which would be the largest ever. Shares of Philip Morris Cos., which is trying to acquire Kraft Inc., also surged.    Other food and tobacco stocks also continued rising. The RJR Nabisco proposal and Philip Morris's bid for Kraft have &quot;rekindled all sorts of investor interest in searching around for other like consumer-brand companies,&quot; especially food companies, said Bob Heisterberg, senior vice president at Alliance Capital Management.    Investment managers were especially encouraged by fresh squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, at a meeting in Madrid. &quot;The white smoke coming out of OPEC clearly indicates they aren't going to get their act together in limiting production,&quot; asserted Mr. Coxon of Cigna.    As oil dropped, bonds rose, even though the dollar declined against the Japanese yen and West German mark. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds rose about 5/8 point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount.    Bonds also received an additional boost from the Federal Reserve. Traders said the Fed's action yesterday in supplying reserves to the banking system indicated that the central bank isn't tightening credit, as some analysts had feared earlier this week.    In major markets yesterday:   STOCKS ROSE SHARPLY in the afternoon. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues topped decliners by a 1,051-to-420 margin. Big Board volume totaled 189.6 million shares.    Broader market indexes also posted large gains. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index jumped 5.91 to 282.88, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite index rose 2.83 to 159.01.    BONDS ALSO CLIMBED after a slow start. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds were quoted late in the day at a yield of 8.84%, down from 8.90%.    THE DOLLAR fell against most major foreign currencies. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7991 marks and 126.90 yen, compared with 1.8134 marks and 127.48 yen the previous day. </TEXT></DOC>
