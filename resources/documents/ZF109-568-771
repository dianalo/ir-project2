says the newcomer breathlessly and almost completelyincomprehensibly: once it has calmed down and got its breath back, EliteMicroelectronics Inc goes on to explain that it was founded in San Jose lastyear to provide manufacturers of personal computers with building block chipsets, and that its first product is a two-chip set that is designed toprovide the core logic functions required by board and system manufacturersto build 33MHz cache-based 80386 AT-alikes with minimum chip count; the set,samples of which are available now, costs $168 for 1,000-up, and the companyclaims that system motherboard can be built with as few as 25 componentsincluding CPU, Eagle chip set, BIOS, keyboard controller, integratedperipheral controller and a few discrete TTI devices; Eagle provides CPU buscontrol, DRAM control, and data conversion between the various buses as wellas an integrated cache controller.andM;- o -andM;Sparc International Inc is still keeping its membership list a secret but itsays it's now got 80 names to protect, which is up from the 60 it claimed twomonths ago.andM;- o -andM;Early indications concerning Sun Microsystems Inc' policy over its ongoingUnix System V.4 development suggest that Sun is currently less than willingto license the technology to the growing band of Sparc system buildersthrough Sparc International, instead hoping to keep it as a value-added plus:although it's early days, such a move could be a stumbling block to Sparcdevelopers - but with V.4 implementations already emerging from the likes ofICL Ltd, dependence on the Sun operating system software may not be socrucial in the future.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Co and Sun Microsystems Inc are extending their System V.4co-development contract so Sun will maintain what its got in there.andM;- o -andM;Lincoln, Nebraska-based Terrano Corp has won a contract from Humana Inc,Louisville, Kentucky for its ILS-5 Laboratory Information System at theHumana Hospital, Huntsville: the software runs on Prime Computer Inc50-series minis and includes Terrano's Anatomic Surgical InformationRetrieval System, Transfusion Service Manager, Advanced Microbiology andLaboratory Management Modules and Instrument Interfaces.andM;- o -andM;At press time, it seemed that Sun Microsystems Inc may have made a decisionover whether or not to take the Research, Development andamp; Innovations Inc BriteLite Sparc-based laptop OEM: the test will be whether or not the machineappears on the Sun stand at Comdex/Fall.andM;- o -andM;Fora Inc, San Jose, California reckons that it has cracked the problems ofpowering a laptop to use a gas plasma display instead of those ghastly liquidcrystal diode displays that most people have to put up with: its new LP386SXModel 50 has standard configuration of 1Mb RAM, 64Kb ROM, 40Mb hard and1.44Mb floppy drive, lists for $4,800 and ships next month and the high powerconsumption of gas plasma is alleviated by using a removable rechargeable 48Watt-hour Nickel Cadmium battery and an intelligent power management systemto enable battery saving hard disk and display sleep modes; it weighs a hefty19.8 lbs with the battery, and measures 13&quot; by 14.6&quot; by 3.9&quot;.andM;- o -andM;Archive Corp's Maynard subsidiary in Lake Mary, Florida has has increasedcapacity of its MaynStream digital audio tape drives to 2.0Gb and reduced thesize to fit the 3.5&quot; half height form factor: it will be available from firstquarter of 1991, at no increase in price - which is $5,500 to $6,200; Maynardalso introduced a new generation of its QICStream software for its Archive VPseries of tape back-up subsystems - release 2.01 adds user-configuredfeatures that customise the back-up and retrieval processes to address thespecific requirements of each installation; it's also out first quarter 1991.andM;- o -andM;Apple Computer Inc, which has so far been seen as something of a reluctantUnix player, last week began its first A/UX-only advertising campaign in theUS trade press: Apple, whose A/UX Unix implementation is at the System V.2.2level has not publically commited to either Unix V.4 or OSF/1 operatingsystem technology - it recently joined both Unix International and the OpenSoftware Foundation - but can be regarded as being firmly in the ATandamp;T campaccording to sources.andM;- o -andM;Expanding its relationship with Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services Inc, MCICommunications Corp will retain Comdisco to provide US-wide businesscontinuity services for MCI's major data centres, complementing the company'sexisting data recovery facilities: Comdisco's Consulting Division willenhance MCI's existing restoration contingency plans and will use a number ofMCI sites as Comdisco Business Recovery Facilities, with the first the one inNorth Royalton, Ohio.andM;- o -andM;Tony Heywood, managing director of Uniplex Ltd at its home in the UK, calledby staffers &quot;the charm, the brains and the charisma&quot;

the system enables customers to use their touch tone phones to dialthe Pacific Bell Message Center to provide call answering, accepting spokenmessages when the phone is not answered or when it is busy; users can alsosend a spoken reply to the original sender or pass the message on to anotherperson; send messages to other users or groups without calling them directlyvia a distribution list held by system, and assign each member of the familya unique voice mail number; no value given.andM;- o -andM;Acton, Massachusetts-based Bechtel Software Inc says it has converted itsWalkthru design animation software to run on Silicon Graphics Inc' newIrisvision graphics board for AT-alikes and PS/2s (CI No 1,545): Walkthruenables users to to view three-dimensional computer models &quot;as though theyalready exist in the real world - by simply loading model files ontoWalkthru, users can see the designs in fully shaded images and move aroundthe model in real-time,&quot; Bechtel says; the software will sell for $4,000.andM;- o -andM;Sun Microsystems Inc declares that the symmetric multiprocessor Sparc machinethat is being prepared for launch by the end of next year will run anoperating system of Sun's own concoction: it will bow to the exigencies ofSystem V.4's Applications Binary and Applications Programming Interfaces; Sunsays it has had a fully staffed development group working on the project forthe last two years and reportedly has had symmetric multiprocessing up andrunning &quot;in different stages&quot; over the last six months.andM;- o -andM;Birmingham-based Computer Disaster Recovery Ltd is expanding into continentalEurope and opening offices in France, Germany and Switzerland: the companyalready has operations in Belgium and Holland.andM;- o -andM;Ross Systems Ltd, the Bristol-based accounting software house for DEC's VAXmachines says that its turnover has increased by 47% to #2.5m for the yearwhich ended June 30 1990.andM;- o -andM;Integrated Software Solutions, the Cheltenham-based developer of the Selectreal-time computer-aided software engineering toolset, has received anunspecified injection of cash from the venture capital group 3i: the companysays the investment will be used to fund product development and establish aEuropean distribution network.andM;- o -andM;Not too surprisingly, Ferranti International Plc is finding it exceedinglydifficult to find a buyer for its 64% stake in Ferranti Creditphone, theZonephone Telepoint pocket phone system;
