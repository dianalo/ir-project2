With campaigns for many causes entering the end-of-year period when giving is traditionally highest, some donors have turned hesitant because of the market's fall. And although it's too early to say whether giving is headed for a broad decline, the sudden bear market has reduced expectations of the big increase that had been predicted for 1987 in the wake of economic expansion.    Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, for example, says donations have fallen 20% to 25% since the market cracked on Oct. 19. Georgia Institute of Technology and six other Atlanta-area schools and hospitals, meanwhile, have watched a bequest of stock lose millions of its value during estate proceedings that have delayed its delivery.    A spokesman for the United Jewish Appeal of New York, a big beneficiary of Wall Street largess, says it remains optimistic during an &quot;extremely sensitive period.&quot; But some donors, he adds, have rebuffed U.J.A. solicitations until the market picture looks clearer.    &quot;The enemy of philanthropy is uncertainty, and that's what we have now,&quot; says Robert Thompson, chairman of Ketchum Inc., a Pittsburgh-based fund-raising adviser. Until the crash, Ketchum was forecasting that charitable giving would grow as much as 9% this year from $87.2 billion in 1986. Now Mr. Thompson foresees growth closer to 5% -- a difference of more than $3 billion.    Religious giving, mainly to the church collection plate, accounts for about 45% of all charity and usually holds up well even during hard times, according to the New York-based American Association of Fund-Raising Council. But the outlook may be less favorable for schools, hospitals, the arts and nonreligious providers of human services, whose benefactors are typically more vulnerable to hazardous fallout from tumbling stock prices.    Ketchum estimates that $15 billion of all donations comes directly in the form of securities -- mainly stocks -- whose full market value can be deducted from a donor's income for tax purposes. When stock prices fall, such donors lose both giving ability and tax incentives. The largest beneficiaries of this type of gift are colleges and universities, many of whom estimate they receive about a third of their $7.5 billion in annual donations in this form.    Georgetown University says gifts from alumni and parents to its annual fund-raising drive have dropped by 10% so far in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago. Gifts in a drive to raise $113 million for capital investment and other projects are holding about even with last year.    Adele Wells, vice president for alumni relations at Georgetown, says she's optimistic because of several large gifts in negotiation. But the university has canceled fund-raising functions for bankers and brokers in New York. &quot;This isn't a time to be soliciting from Wall Street,&quot; she says.    Foundations, whose philanthropy last year totaled $5.2 billion, according to the fund-raising council, typically give charities each year a fixed percentage of their total asset base. Because their assets are usually invested in stocks and bonds, foundations' charitable payout is expected to be reduced over the next year unless the market recovers.    Most important from the fund-raisers' perspective, however, is that the plummeting market may have had an unsettling effect on donors' attitudes.    Mortimer Chute, vice president for development at Sloan-Kettering, says the decrease in giving has been a &quot;psychological thing rather than a pragmatic thing.&quot; Most of the hospital and research center's donors give $10 to $250 apiece. Mr. Chute notes that, although &quot;these aren't people who have lost hundreds of thousands in capital gains on paper,&quot; many are from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut and have seen the market's debacle up close.    Although Sloan-Kettering still expects donations this year to exceed last year's $51.6 million, it is &quot;redoubling&quot; fund-raising efforts because of the recent drop-off, Mr. Chute says. Donors who have given more than $1,000 in the past three years will get an extra mailing before Christmas, stressing that while the donor's stocks may have lost value recently they are probably still worth more than the purchase price, a factor that enhances the tax advantages of giving them.    Not surprisingly, Wall Street's waning prosperity is also expected to damp the flow of gifts from the financial industry itself, some of which have been among the largest in the country in recent years. For example, Charles and Herbert Allen, principals in Allen andamp; Co., gave $15 million last year to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Other gifts from Wall Streeters included $3 million to Princeton University from Ralph DeNunzio, a former chairman of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    &quot;I'm sure (such) giving will be affected,&quot; says Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of Bear Stearns Cos. &quot;How much people give is a function of how much they make, and when they make less they will give less.&quot;    Barring a turnabout in Wall Street's fortunes, those making less will include Bear Stearns's 130 managing directors, each of whom is obliged by a company rule to give 4% of total compensation to charity. Bear Stearns's contributions totaled between $8 and $10 million in the company's fiscal year ended May 30. Mr. Greenberg isn't making any predictions about this year.    Gary Evans, vice chancellor for development at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says the market's fall came at an especially inopportune time for fund-raisers. For tax reasons, he notes, November and December are usually the biggest months for giving.    &quot;If all the gyrations had occurred last May, we might already be over the shock,&quot; Mr. Evans explains. Instead, he says, &quot;we're looking at December with instability. I'd be delighted to be wrong, but I think it will have an adverse impact.&quot; Like other fund-raisers, Mr. Evans says he's stressing to prospective donors the relative advantages of deducting this year's donation from income that will be taxed at a top rate of 38.5%, compared with next year's 28% maximum.    An immediate hazard for some fund-raisers has been the market decline's effect on stock bequests or pledges that haven't yet arrived. One of the largest such paper losses occurred in a bequest by George Woodruff, one of the sons of the founder of Coca-Cola Co.    At his death last February, Mr. Woodruff willed about half his estate, made up largely of Coke stock, to a group of nonprofit institutions, including Georgia Tech, Mercer University, Agnes Scott College and several Atlanta-area hospitals. Although a challenge to the will was settled without reducing the size of the gift, the value of the group's shares slid $40 million from Coke's peak stock-market levels in August to about $110 million while they awaited dispersal from the estate.    Fund-raisers acknowledge that they are eager to put the best face possible on the situation, because donors don't like giving to campaigns that are perceived to be flagging. In addition, says David Tobin, assistant director of Independent Sector, a Washington-based charitable trade group, those soliciting money play down possible impact of the market's plunge. &quot;The idea,&quot; he explains, &quot;is to convince givers they should give whether they're rich or not. You don't want to make a link between wealth and giving.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
