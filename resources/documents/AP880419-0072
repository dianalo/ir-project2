(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge imposed a 14-yearsentence on the political boss of a mountain coal mining county forconspiracy as the county sheriff pleaded guilty to buying his jobfor $100,000.   ``I despise your acts of public corruption,'' U.S. DistrictJudge Charles Haden II said Monday while giving a maximum sentenceto former Mingo County Democratic Chairman Johnie Owens, a formersheriff who admitted selling his job to Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert.   Hilbert resigned Monday and pleaded guilty to three felonycounts in a plea bargain, U.S. Attorney Joe Savage said. He facesup to 13 years in prison and $351,000 in fines.   Haden sentenced Owens to five years in prison plus a $10,000fine on a conspiracy charge and three years each on three taxevasion counts. All sentences are to be served consecutively, Hadensaid, adding that to give a lighter sentence would ``minimize theseriousness of your activity.''   ``You sold that office. ... That is in and of itself a monstrouscrime,'' Haden told Owens, who pleaded guilty. ``There's no way tosugar-coat that and say it should be understood in the context ofMingo County.''   The county is known historically as the site of theHatfield-McCoy feud and is at the center of political corruptionand drug trafficking in which nearly 50 public officials oremployees in southern West Virginia have been charged or convictedin the last two years.   ``If ever this cycle of corruption breeding corruption is to bestopped, it has to be stopped with some signal event that will tellthe people of Mingo County who were slaves to the system that theyare free,'' Haden said.   Owens also faces sentencing today in state court on two morecharges in connection with the same case. His plea agreementindicates that those state sentences will be served at the sametime as the federal sentences.   Haden set Hilbert's sentencing for June 13 in Huntington.Hilbert, 45, pleaded guilty to mail fraud for backdating amotorcycle accident report to protect an uninsured driver, failureto report income he later used to purchase the sheriff's job, andconspiracy to purchase the sheriff's job and use it to assistrelatives and business associates in illegal activities.   Also sentenced Monday was former county Economic OpportunityCommission Director Larry C. Hamrick, who pleaded guilty earlierthis year to one count each of conspiracy to possess marijuana withintent to deliver, obstruction of justice and defrauding thegovernment.   Hamrick, 47, of Williamson was sentenced to 12 years in prison,just three years short of the maximum sentence, fined $2,000 andordered to repay the EOC, an anti-poverty agency, an amount yet tobe determined by federal auditors.   The former Mingo County school board member also was indictedtwo weeks ago, along with 14 other county political figures, oncharges of trying to control the 1984 county election by channelinglarge amounts of money into Owens' political organization.</TEXT></DOC>
