Analysts expected thescandal-plagued company to quickly regain its market share.   Japan's Finance Ministry had ordered 87 Nomura offices tosuspend operations as a penalty for the company's excessivepromotion of a railway company's stock, which was linked to aformer crime boss. Nomura had been first among securitiesfirms in market share but fell to third or fourth placeduring the one-month business restriction, spokesman TakushiAbe said. Mr. Abe said the firm's loss of income fromcommissions over the period was about three billion yen($23.1 million), or about 1% to 1.5% of the company's totalprofit.</LP><TEXT>   But analysts said Nomura's longtime dominance of theJapanese stock market would not be easily undermined. Nomurawill have &quot;no problems&quot; recovering its pre-suspension marketshare of about 9% because of its huge manpower and capitalresources, said Robert Zielinski, a finance analyst atJardine Fleming.   Seventy-nine of the 87 suspended offices resumedoperation, but the other eight were suspended for six weeksand will reopen Nov. 26. The restrictions cut off about halfof Nomura's business, Mr. Abe said.   Mr. Zielinski said Nomura has suffered somewhat from thescandals. &quot;Nomura has lost some credibility . . . It has hadto promise the Finance Ministry not to be too bullish&quot; in itsbusiness practices, he said.   Nomura, with 12,000 employees, had operating revenue of495.89 billion yen in 1990, making it the largest brokeragein the world.   Separately, the Japan Bond Research Institute lowered thecredit ratings of Nomura and Japan's three other largestsecurities firms, saying there was &quot;strong fear the slump inprofits at the Big Four could become a long-term trend.&quot;   Nomura was lowered to double-A-plus from triple-A, DaiwaSecurities Co. was cut to double-A from double-A-plus, NikkoSecurities Co. was reduced to double-A from double-A-plus andYamaichi Securities Co. was downgraded to double-A-minus fromdouble-A-plus.</TEXT></DOC>
