This background information provides a foundationfor understanding how periphyton communities respond after a disturbance.The paper's second section analyzes how periphyton communities respondto four different types of disturbance (flood events, desiccation, nutrientenrichment, and toxic metal exposure). Although data are limited, loticperiphyton communities are relatively resilient. Fast growth rates andgeneration times of periphytic organisms, coupled with their flexiblelife history strategies and good dispersal ability, should enable thesecommunities to recover to a pre-disturbance, community biomass levelwithin weeks to months after a disturbance. However, disturbance typeand severity, local environmental conditions, and site-specific factorsalso will influence recovery rates. Future research needs include a betterunderstanding of interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs withinthe periphyton mat, particularly with respect to nutrient cycling, competitiveinteractions among organisms; functional specificity of organisms; andthe influence of the riparian zone and channel geomorphology on periphytonrecovery rates. 173 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
