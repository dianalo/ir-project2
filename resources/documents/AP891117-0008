Now the influence wielded by popular revolt has to betransformed into a movement that can make decisions and exercisepower.   New Forum, the largest opposition group, is only 2 months old.Other movements, such as the Social Democratic Party and DemocracyNow, are even younger.   They are hampered by lack of office space, telephones and otheressentials for building an organization capable of matching thepowerful apparatus of the Communist Party.   Although demoralized, the Communists still have tens ofthousands of powerful positions, privileges and a vast medianetwork at their disposal.   Unlike the Social Democrats, who are attracting middle-aged EastGermans hoping to make careers in an organized party, New Forumruns on a theory of ``grass-roots democracy'' that leaves itsomewhere between a political movement and a potential party inParliament.   That is confusing for people who for 40 years have seen politicsas a sham in which they have no genuine say. They expect New Forum_ the only recognizable force in the astounding popular revolt ofthe past month _ to oust the Communist Party.   The confusion was evident at a meeting this week of some 120members of the central Leipzig branch of New Forum.   Seated in the pews of a city church, an audience with an averageage of about 25 asked questions with restraint and disciplinerarely seen in Western political debates.   Should Communist Party members be allowed to work with NewForum? Will New Forum contest the promised free elections? What isthe movement's program?   The energetic leaders of Leipzig's New Forum, far betterorganized in factories, institutes and outlying suburbs than theirfellow activists in East Berlin, patiently tried to outline plans.   ``Of course,'' pastor Martin Kind explained, ``we would attractmembers if we produced a program now. But we must take the moretiring task of trying to politicize each individual. ... Peoplemust learn what they don't know yet.''   New Forum plans to do this by forming ``Basisgruppen'' _ orbasic groups _ in neighborhoods and workplaces and ``theme groups''to tackle issues such as ecology or East Germany's strained publichealth system.   Each district group will elect people who in turn will nominatemembers of a citywide group that will send members to New Forum'snational bodies.   The structure is aimed at making East Germans politically awareand active.   West Germany's Greens, who sent members to Leipzig and Berlinthis week to talk with New Forum, evolved along similar lines. TheGreens wield more influence than pure power, and New Forum hopes todo the same.   Fine and good, said a woman pensioner, but what aboutorganization? She cycled clear across Leipzig last weekend insearch of a supposed New Forum meeting.   Other New Forum members complained that Communists, seeking toestablish credentials as reformers by talking to the opposition,sometimes announced a ``dialogue'' without telling New Forum.   New Forum, the Social Democrats and others have a tough task tokeep the revolt peaceful and to build a democracy in a climate inwhich politics is discredited.   But many East Germans reckon that now is the best chance theywill ever have to transform communism into a working democracy.   ``If we don't succeed this time,'' Kind told a Western reporterduring a meeting break, ``then we'll never make it. They can sendus all to Siberia and rule as they please.''</TEXT></DOC>
