Gorbachev said at a statedinner Monday for West Germany's Helmut Kohl that the Soviet Unionis not an ``economic backyard'' and reforms are succeeding despiteinternational doubts.   Lack of progress in relations with the Soviet Union ``feeds onthe outdated stereotypes that the Russians will not be able tomanage by themselves,'' he said. ``I want to say to all who aregoing to have business with us _ we will manage.''   Gorbachev, who also heads the Soviet Communist Party, seemed tobe replying to questions raised in the West about his ability tostay in power and install his reform program through the upheavalit is already beginning to cause.   There has been considerable controversy over the $9 billion incredits Moscow has arranged in recent months from Western banks,including some in West Germany. Some politicians oppose suchlending, saying the Soviet Union should be forced to cut defensespending in order to increase the production of needed food andconsumer products.   Gorbachev told Soviet television earlier that he and ChancellorKohl had started their first meeting of the four-day official visitwith cordial discussions of difficult issues and he said ``we havea real chance'' to achieve a substantial improvement in relations.   ``The ice has started to move, and we hope it will start tofloat away,'' Gorbachev said.   Monday's meeting was the first formal meeting between the twomen since Gorbachev became the Soviet leader in 1985.   Warmer relations with West Germany would be a significantchange. The Soviet Union has for decades acted as if the Naziinvasion occurred yesterday rather than almost 50 years ago.   However, Gorbachev refused to budge from Moscow's longtimerefusal to consider any move toward the unification of East andWest Germany.   Kohl, in his address, called for a ``healing of old wounds.''   ``It must become possible for the Germans to overcome thedivision of their country by peaceful means,'' the chancellor said.   Following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the nationsplit into communist East Germany, a member of the Soviet bloc, andWest Germany, a strong ally of the United States and member of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.   In a surprise comment during the dinner speech Gorbachevsuggested that Europe needs a unified electrical and transportationnetwork.   Kohl also spoke of ``transboundary challenges'' and namedterrorism, drugs and epidemics as issues requiring greatercooperation. But he said the greatest obstacle to warm relations isSoviet superiority in conventional armed forces in Europe.   In a related meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze suggested to West German Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher that a summit meeting of the leaders ofEurope, the United States and Canada might help produce progress inVienna negotiations on reductions in conventional weapons andforces.   Among business deals signed between Soviet and West Germanenterprises Monday was an agreement by the German Siemens firm toaid Soviet organizations in the design and creation of nuclearpower stations, computers and medical equipment.   Soviet-West German relations have been improving in the pastyear, especially since the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in Decemberin Washington when Gorbachev and President Reagan signed a treatyto ban medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles in Europe.   Kohl was greeted at the Vnukovo Airport by Shevardnadze, PremierNikolai I. Ryzhkov, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and other topofficials.   He and his wife Hannelore then went to the Kremlin for a formalgreeting in St. George's Hall by Gorbachev and his wife Raisa.</TEXT></DOC>
