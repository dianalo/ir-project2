HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMT CSVBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Thomas Spiegel, president ofColumbia Savings andamp; Loan Association, took a $5.1 million cutin compensation last year, at least partly because ofpressure from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board   Still, Mr. Spiegel, who has been responsible for Columbia's major investments in high-yield, low-rated debt securities known as junk bonds, is likely to remain the thrift industry's highest-paid executive.    In proxy materials for its annual meeting, Columbia said Mr. Spiegel received $960,000 in salary and a $2.9 million bonus last year. In 1985, Mr. Spiegel received the same salary, plus a $3 million bonus and a $5 million contribution to his retirement plan account, for a total of nearly $9 million. No contribution to Mr. Spiegel's retirement account was made last year.    After Mr. Spiegel's 1985 compensation was disclosed, the Bank Board asked Columbia to recover all but the $960,000 salary. Later, however, the Bank Board asked Columbia for more information about the compensation of Mr. Spiegel and other officers and directors.    Columbia said in its proxy that it &quot;has yet to receive any indication&quot; about whether the Bank Board will take further action. Lee N. Eckel, Columbia's general counsel, said he believes the Bank Board knows it is &quot;on very shaky legal ground&quot; and that the dispute will be resolved in a few months. The Bank Board declined to comment.    In its proxy, Columbia said its directors believe that a bigger 1986 bonus for Mr. Spiegel &quot;was justified and deserved&quot; but decided to defer action until the dispute with the Bank Board is resolved. Mr. Spiegel's $2.9 million bonus for 1986 was based on Columbia's performance during the first quarter and was awarded in April 1986, before Columbia received the Bank Board's letter, Mr. Eckel said.    In the proxy, Columbia also disclosed that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. holds the equivalent of 5.4% of Columbia's common shares and 11.8% of its preferred shares. Most of the stake is in the form of warrants which can be converted into common and preferred shares.    Columbia does a substantial amount of business with Drexel, particularly Drexel's junk-bond unit, which also is based in Beverly Hills. Columbia isn't viewed as a takeover target largely because Mr. Spiegel's family currently controls 37.8% of Columbia's voting shares, and could control substantially more by exercising warrants or converting debt securities into equity shares.    In its annual report to the Bank Board, Columbia also disclosed that it held about $2.6 billion of junk bonds at Dec. 31, or about 25% of assets at that date. At June 30, Columbia's junk portfolio was about $2.33 billion, or 28% of assets.    Last year, Columbia's net income jumped 58% to $193.5 million, or $4.35 a fully diluted share, from $122.3 million, or $3.08 a fully diluted share, in 1985. Its return on average shareholders' equity was 46% in 1986, compared with 59% in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
