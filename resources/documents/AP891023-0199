In daily campaign appearances and statements, Buchi isrepeatedly accusing opposition contender Patricio Aylwin of actingin concert with Marxist extremists and of condoning the scatteredacts of violence in what has been a largely peaceful campaign.   He hopes to frighten middle-class voters away from Aylwin, amoderate Christian Democrat heavily favored in most opinion pollsto win the Dec. 14 election to replace Gen. Augusto Pinochet, thepresident since the military took power in 1973.   The opposition confidently predicts the failure, however, ofBuchi's aggressive tack.   ``It's a crass error,'' Carlos Huneeus, a pollster working withthe Aylwin campaign, said in an interview. ``It has nothing to dowith reality in Chile.''   Pinochet was forced to call elections after Chileans, in ayes-or-no ballot last year, rejected a proposal that he remainleader until 1997. He is scheduled to hand power over to the newpresident in March.   Aylwin led a coalition of centrist and leftist parties thatcampaigned for Pinochet's defeat in the referendum and is now itssole presidential candidate.   Buchi, 40, was Pinochet's finance minister for four years untilMarch and is backed by rightist political groups. A third candidateis a populist banker-businessman, Francisco Errazuriz.   In the first days of the campaign, after the candidatesregistered in July, Buchi stressed his achievements as financeminister. They include steady economic growth and low inflation, insharp contrast to other Latin American countries.   But the message apparently has won him few backers. Polls inearly October indicated he is trailing Aylwin by as much as 30percentage points. It was then he went on the attack.   He charged that Aylwin has a ``secret pact'' with leftists whohad been prominent in the turbulent government of PresidentSalvador Allende, the Marxist who was elected to office in 1970.Further, Buchi claimed, the leftists are likely to again plungeChile into the economic and social chaos that marked the Allendeyears and prompted the 1973 coup.   He blamed Aylwin's supporters for beating Buchi backers andbombing some campaign offices.   In a televised debate with Aylwin Oct. 9, Buchi hinted that hisopponent's backers might be responsible for the hit-and-run deathof a pro-Buchi labor activist. But a police investigation laterdetermined that he was killed in an ordinary traffic accident.   Aylwin, a 70-year-old veteran statesman, has responded byemphasizing his own reputation as a moderate and accuses Buchi ofwaging an undignified and irresponsible ``scare campaign.''   Aylwin's principal campaign message has been the need fornational unity to assure a democratic transition.   But Buchi's backers contend that the Aylwin camp is guilty ofbelow-the-belt politics.   ``They are trying to define the Dec. 14 election as a choicebetween dictatorship and democracy, which is a lie,'' said Buchi'scampaign manager, Pablo Baraona.   ``It is not dictatorship or democracy that is at stake here. Itis two democratic platforms.''   Buchi has tried to distance himself from Pinochet, evenrecommending publicly that Pinochet give up his command of the armywhen the change in government takes place.   Pinochet has said he plans to remain on as commander, a postthat the country's 1980 constitution allows him to keep for eightmore years.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday PMs, Oct. 30</NOTE></DOC>
