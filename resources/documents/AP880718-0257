The proposed contract requires no wage concessions by the 5,500pilots and offers pay raises to recently hired pilots, according toa report in Monday's editions of the Chicago Tribune.   The pilots' buyout offer of $110 per share in cash would requirepilots to make substantial concessions, including a 10-year, 25percent pay cut.   ``What the pilots have designed as part of their takeover planis Draconian givebacks,'' said Edward Starkman, an analyst in NewYork with PaineWebber Inc. ``I can't imagine they'd be too thrilledwith it and they haven't been.''   Pilots of other airlines, including Eastern and Pan Am, agreedto wage cuts of up to 20 percent in their most recent contracts,said Candace Browning, an analyst with Wertheim, Schroeder andamp; Co. inNew York.   ``In light of the buyout bid and in light of what other airlinesare asking for, it seems like a very attractive offer,'' Ms.Browning said.   Neither the airline nor the pilots' union, the United MasterExecutive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association, would commenton the contract proposal or the ongoing negotiations. The previouspact expired in April, said union spokesman Hank Krakowski.   Krakowksi said the contract proposal was not connected with thepilots' buyout offer, formally known as an Employee Stock OwnershipPlan.   ``It just happens that we have contract negotiations going onconcurrent with the ESOP effort,'' he said. ``They're two separatesubjects completely.''   United's reported proposal for a 5-year freeze on the salariesof senior pilots and a cumulative 10 percent raise for about 1,100pilots hired since 1985 is in line with ALPA's longstanding demandthat airlines do away with two-scale wage systems, Starkman said.   Annual salares for United pilots range from $21,600 for afirst-year, Boeing 727 flight engineer to $152,000 for a Boeing 747captain.   United's proposal also calls for an 8 percent increase in pilotproductivity, the Tribune reported. In return, United pledged toremain committed to the airline business and to provide moreopportunity for promotions through expansion, the newspaper said.   United has had a prickly relationship with its pilots since a29-day pilot strike in 1985.   The pilots' offer to buy the airline hinges on the outcome oftheir lawsuit challenging anti-takeover provisions in United'scontract with the International Association of Machinists.   Murphy said the proposal was the first specific packagepresented at the bargaining table since contract negotiations beganin February. He said he expected no concrete results fromnegotiations before the end of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
