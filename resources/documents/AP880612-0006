(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On a small dairy farm tucked under the Canadianborder, the ``For Sale'' sign has come down. Vermonters, worriedthat the small farmer might become an endangered species, hope itis the beginning of a trend.   What prompted Gary Jacobs to change his mind and stay on his100-cow farm was the promise of $5,000 cash this year from thestate.   Most of Vermont's 2,700 farmers are eligible for the subsidyunder the first such program ever enacted by a state. Farmers haveuntil Wednesday to apply; a maximum of $5,000 will be paid eachfarmer.   The subsidy was born out of fear that the farms that play such alarge role in the heritage of one of the nation's most rural stateswould soon vanish from the landscape.   The fear was well-founded: 10 percent of Vermont's 3,000 farmswent out of business in the past two years.   ``It's viewed as being rather revolutionary,'' said VermontAgriculture Commissioner Ronald Allbee of the new program. ``It'sviewed as, `I can't believe Vermont did it.'''   ``I think this is a ray of sunlight to all the dairy farmers inthe state of Vermont,'' said Ronald Morrissette of East Randolph,the first to sign up for the subsidy.   The problem facing dairy farmers was simple: The price of milkwas falling; costs were rising. Between 1981 and 1987, the pricefarmers received for their milk declined, in real dollars, from$13.90 to $12.43 per hundred pounds of milk. More than 40 percentof the farms in the state were operating below the break-even point.   The culprit was a federal policy designed to reduce a milksurplus in the West. The policy, farmers said, was ruining dairyfarms in New England, where there was a shortage of milk.   As 1988 began, Vermont farmers endured another reduction in thefederal price support, the price the federal ensures farmers fortheir milk, and faced the prospect of more cuts. The state decidedto step in.   At first Gov. Madeleine Kunin opposed the one-year $7.5 millionprogram as bad fiscal policy that wouldn't give farmers thelong-term help they needed.   But lawmakers and citizens groups _ seeing state coffersoverflowing from a strong economy _ rallied around the subsidy,concerned that the loss of farmers and farmland would change theface of Vermont and remove land treasured for hunting, fishing,trapping and sightseeing.   ``They're the custodians of the countryside,'' state Sen.Francis Howrigan, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee,said of the farmers.   The subsidy program will pay farmers 50 cents for every hundredpounds of milk they produce up to 1 million pounds, which is morethan the average farm produces. It's available to farmers whoreceive at least half their gross income from farming, make lessthan $32,000 a year, and belong to a milk cooperative or an11-state dairy cartel that's trying to win a higher milk price forNortheast farmers.   The program faces a legal challenge from a group of farmers whosay the program discriminates against those few who do not belongto co-ops.   The Legislature this year also enacted some long-term help forfarmers that will give them big breaks on their property taxes infuture years. The state will pay up to approximately 90 percent offarmers' local property taxes if they agree to continue farming.   The tax program covers all non-dairy farmers this year; nextyear, when the dairy subsidy is eliminated, it will apply to dairyfarmers.   But lawmakers and farmers say the state cannot afford tocontinue its $7.5 million subsidy and that the true solution cancome only from the Congress.   ``It's the finger in a dike that is getting an ever-widerfissure,'' said New Hampshire Agriculture Commissioner StephenTaylor. ``I think we're in a dire situation, and I don't think thestate of Vermont has the resources to carry that farmer for a longperiod of time.''   Jacobs expects to triple the value of his $5,000 payment fromthe state by using it to grow feed, one of his rapidly risingexpenses.   ``It's going to make a difference, and it gives you a chance,''he said, surveying the corn field that lies in the shadow of JayPeak, a popular ski area. ``It may turn around.''</TEXT></DOC>
