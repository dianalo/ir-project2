ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As a Senate committee continued reviewingleveraged buyouts and whether they should be restricted, Wall Streetdeal makers reacted with anger and skepticism Wednesday aboutproposals to curtail the popular method for financing corporateacquisitions.   ``They're trying to design a cure for something that has not beena problem,'' said Tony James, a managing director at DonaldsonLufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.   On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady suggested to theSenate Finance Committee that tax deductions for corporate interestpayments be limited, while a new deduction for stock dividends becreated.   At issue is whether the government wants to discourage thebuildup of huge amounts of corporate debt that are central toleveraged buyouts, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s recentrecord $24.53 billion agreement to buy RJR Nabisco Inc.   In a leveraged buyout, investors go heavily into debt to buy outa company. The company than pays off the debt with its cash flow orby selling some of its assets.   But deal makers questioned the feasibility of limiting LBO debtand said it would be difficult to define how much of a firm'sinterest payments are attributable to the cost of an acquisition.   Joseph Bartlett, a partnr and LBO specialist at the law firmGaston andamp; Snow, said that even if LBO debt is limited acquirers wouldfind ways around the restrictions.   ``Instead of borrowing, you will use sale-leasebacks. You say,`This isn't debt anymore,''' he said.   Bartlett also warned that too much tinkering with the corporateacquisition process could lead to unintended _ and unwanted _consequences, such as increased ownership of U.S. companies bycash-rich foreigners.   Past proposals to limit takeovers have had a devastating effecton Wall Street. In October 1987, congressional committees approvedtax increase bills that some critics charged helped contribute tothe stock market crash that month. The House version includedprovisions to sharply restrict the deduction for interest expensesincurred in takeovers.   But observers generally doubted anything substantive would comeout of this year's hearings.   ``There'll be a lot of discussion, but in the end relativelylittle action,'' said one principal in a major Wall Streetinvestment partnership who asked not to be identified.   ``The only danger is that people get caught up in the theater ofit all and they have some obligation to show some results,'' hesaid. ``That could be dangerous _ you could end up having stupidpolicy made.''   There may be skepticism now, but in 1988 deal makers who sawchanges in the law looming on the horizon weren't taking any chances.   Last year brought a storm of buyouts and bids _ including the RJRNabisco deal _ and many securities analysts attributed the intenseactivity to acquirers trying to wrap up takeovers while the Reaganadministration still was in office.   The presidential election campaign brought a number of bipartisancalls for more reins on corporate takeover activity.   The feeling on Wall Street is that the hearings and proposalshave grown out of a backlash from the takeover battle for RJRNabisco.   ``The politicians feel some negative reaction to the amount ofmoney being made on Wall Street and so there's a lot of curbing theLBO trend or curbing the acquisition trend,'' said the investmentpartnership principal.   ``There is is sort of a public consensus to do something aboutRJR Nabisco,'' said Bartlett. ``The problem is, in Washington theyhaven't figured out what that something is.''   Another criticism is that any action would not only affect thebig deals, but also the smaller, less highly-publicized buyouts thatthe observers say have benefited the country.   ``The buyout business isn't something new,'' said Edward Gibbons,a principal with the investment firm Gibbons, Green van Amerongen.``They've turned out to be fairly good investments over the years.''   ``In not all, but in most cases, we've seen the productivity ofthe businesses improve,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
