In the first day of hearings on President Reagan's nomination of Judge Bork to the Supreme Court, much of the questioning centered on the nominee's frequent and vigorous criticism of Supreme Court decisions that found a constitutional right to privacy implied, although not specifically mentioned, in the Bill of Rights.    The right to privacy is a lightning rod for debate over the nomination because many important Supreme Court principles are built on it. These include a right to sexual privacy for married couples, recognized in a 1965 ruling, and the right to abortion, recognized by the high court in 1973.    Judge Bork said his criticism of the right to privacy is based on the means by which the high court explained it in 1965. He called it a &quot;free-floating right not found in the Constitution.&quot; He said the right is &quot;undefined . . . . We don't know what it is. We don't know what it covers.&quot;    When Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) suggested that the nominee is uncertain as to how he would rule on the right to an abortion, Judge Bork replied, &quot;That is true.&quot; He added that he would have to consider whether some basis could be found in the Constitution for protecting the right to abortion, and whether the expectations of society and government have come to rely on that right.    The right to privacy and a number of other Supreme Court doctrines conflict with his basic view of the role of the courts, Judge Bork said. &quot;The judge's authority,&quot; he said in an opening statement, &quot;derives entirely from the fact that he is applying the law and not his personal views.&quot;    The hearing was an unusual one for Congress, often resembling a law school class more than a confirmation session.    The 60-year-old Mr. Bork, a federal appeals court judge in Washington and a former Yale Law School professor, remained low-key. Although he occasionally appeared defensive, he didn't back away from his views. Instead, he painstakingly explained the complex legal ideas that form his views, pointing out whenever possible that other constitutional scholars or Supreme Court justices share his criticisms.    The opening statements of committee members shed new light on the balance of views on the panel. Five conservative Republicans support the nomination, while five liberal Democrats oppose it. One moderate Republican and three conservative Democrats remain undecided, and their decisions are likely to be influential with other Senate members when the nomination is sent to the floor, probably in mid-October.    All four of the undecided senators, however, raised surprisingly strong concerns, in effect placing the burden on Judge Bork to convince them that his views are within the mainstream of legal thought.    After listening to Judge Bork's responses, one of the undecided Democrats, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, told reporters he wasn't satisified the judge would find &quot;a way in the Constitution to protect&quot; privacy.    Democratic senators, led by Joseph Biden of Delaware, the committee chairman, and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, greeted Judge Bork's scholarly explanations with more down-to-earth illustrations of why they think his views are too conservative to be acceptable in a Supreme Court nominee.    Judge Bork, for example, has criticized a 1942 Supreme Court decision that struck down an Oklahoma law requiring sterilization of habitual criminals. Judge Bork yesterday repeated his view that the high court's decision wasn't based on any right in the Constitution. But while the judge's answers focused on the constitutional theory he said was lacking, Sen. Biden repeatedly reduced the issue to one of whether a state legislature can pass a law requiring sterilization.    And while Judge Bork explained his privacy view in academic terms, Sen. Kennedy argued hypothetically that it could lead Judge Bork to uphold a state law requiring compulsory abortions for women.    In trying to counter critics who say he would overrule many important civil liberties precedents, Judge Bork said, &quot;It is one thing as a legal theorist to criticize the reasoning of a prior decision, even to criticize it severely, as I have done. It is another and more serious thing altogether for a judge to ignore or overturn a prior decision. That requires much careful thought.&quot;    Mr. Bork's testimony will continue today, and the hearings are due to last some two weeks, as witnesses attack and defend his record. Yesterday, he was introduced to the committee by former President Gerald Ford, who called him &quot;uniquely qualified.&quot;    But Sen. Kennedy criticized the judge as &quot;hostile to the rule of law and the role of the courts in protecting individual liberty.&quot; Sen. Kennedy also accused Judge Bork of insensitivity to civil rights, and said, &quot;Your clock on civil rights seems to have stopped in 1954,&quot; the year the Supreme Court ordered school desegregation.    In other testimony, Judge Bork defended his criticism of the Supreme Court's principle of &quot;one-person-one-vote,&quot; saying state legislatures should be able to apportion districts their own way, as long as they are rational. He said the high court erred in striking down a poll tax that was applied to all voters.    Judge Bork said he has opposed the Equal Rights Amendment because it would require the courts, rather than legislatures, to be the focal point for enforcing equal rights. And he said he supports affirmative action policies that would allow private companies &quot;to inform minorities that opportunities exist&quot; and to identify qualified job applicants, but he opposes numerical quotas or permanent use of statistical guidelines. </TEXT></DOC>
