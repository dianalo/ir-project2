The decision marks the first time Canadian auto workers have selected a different target than their U.S. counterparts for a pattern-setting agreement.    The United Auto Workers in the U.S. last Monday selected Ford Motor Co. as its negotiating target. The Canadian union broke away from the UAW in 1985.    Robert White, president of the CAW, said Chrysler Canada Ltd. was chosen because &quot;we'll get all of the attention&quot; from the parent company, whose contract with U.S. workers runs another year. General Motors Corp. and Ford are currently negotiating contracts with the two unions.    Mr. White said the CAW preferred a different target company than the UAW. A possible strike at Ford's U.S. operations would also close its Canadian plants, reducing the CAW's bargaining clout.    Contracts at the Canadian units of GM and Ford expire Sept. 14, the same date as in the U.S. Mr. White said the Canadian union will put negotiations with GM and Ford aside until it reaches a settlement or strike at Chrysler.    William Fisher, Chrysler Canada's chief negotiator, said the auto maker expects to consider making its initial proposals to the union on wages and related economic issues &quot;within the next day or two.&quot; Mr. Fisher made some proposals two weeks ago, including one to reduce certain pension payments.    The CAW, which rejected Chrysler's proposals, has made inflation-indexed pensions its top priority. The union is also seeking a 3% annual wage increase in each year of a three-year accord. The base rate currently is 13.21 Canadian dollars ($10.03) an hour.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Chrysler closed at $43.875 a share, up 62.5 cents.    Mr. Fisher said there is &quot;no reason&quot; a settlement can't be reached without a strike. A strike would close many of Chrysler's U.S. assembly plants within weeks, since they use parts supplied by Chrysler Canada.    Meanwhile, in Dearborn, Mich., UAW President Owen Bieber formally joined negotiations at Ford for the first time since they opened July 28, and met with top Ford officials. Various subcommittees convened, but the sides didn't get together at the main table. Neither side would say when it would make another formal proposal.    The CAW's choice of Chrysler surprised some union officials and industry analysts. Many expected General Motors of Canada Ltd. to be selected, since its 40,000 workers outnumber Chrysler Canada's by four-to-one.    &quot;I figured GM would make the biggest impact. I'm taken aback by Chrysler,&quot; said Dennis DesRosiers, an industry analyst.    GM, the industry's traditional trend-setter, was the target in the previous three rounds of Canadian talks. Mr. White said he didn't choose GM because of &quot;uncertainty&quot; surrounding talks between the company and workers in the U.S.    Many observers believe Ford, the number-two auto maker, will have a relatively easy time reaching an agreement because of its higher profitability and because it makes fewer parts internally than GM. The concern is that GM will have a hard time matching Ford's pact, and will be hit with a strike later. </TEXT></DOC>
