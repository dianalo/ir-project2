Monday introduced three object-oriented programmingadvancements for HP 9000 and HP Apollo computer platforms:andM;o  HP C++ Version 2.1 compiler on the HP-UX operating system;andM;o  HP C++Developer, a class-construction and browsing tool, onandM;Domain operating system; andandM;o  Domain/C++ Version 2.1 language system.andM;These programming advancements add improved compile-time performance,simplified class construction, improved code modification and support for thelatest C++, Version 2.1 from ATandamp;T.andM;The HP-UX and Domain operating systems are based on and fully comply withATandamp;T's UNIX system.andM;Engineers and programmers will be able to use HP's integrated C++ tool set todevelop applications that address such markets as telecommunications,computer-aided design, CAD/CAE engineering, user-interface development,software development, graphics design and text management.andM;HP C++ COMPILER ON HP-UX HP now offers a true C++ compiler based on ATandamp;T C++Version 2.1 on the HP-UX operating system that generates native code on HP9000 systems.andP;  A true C++ compiler generates object code directly from C++source code.andM;&quot;This new release of the HP C++ compiler increases compile-time performanceon HP-UX operating systems up to 75 percent,&quot; said Carl E. Snyder, generalmanager of HP's Systems Technology division.andM;HP C++DEVELOPER ON DOMAIN/OS HP now adds HP C++Developer, a classconstruction and browsing tool, to its Domain/OS platform.andM;&quot;With these tools, C++ developers can take advantage of the object-orientedfeatures of C++ development,&quot; said David M. Perozek, general manager of HP'sApollo Systems division.andP;  &quot;HP C++Developer allows programmers to concentrateon program development while it simplifies class construction.&quot;andM;HP C++Developer is a stand-alone X Window System, Version 11 application thatprovides a graphical representation of the C++ class-inheritance hierarchy.andO;(Inheritance, a key feature of object-oriented programming, allowsprogrammers to collect common code in one place, which reduces developmenttime by simplifying reuse of code and makes code easier to maintain andmodify.)andM;HP C++Developer allows users to browse class definition and member-functionsource code graphically, add and modify classes and inheritance hierarchies,generate source-code templates, and diagnose and correct errorsautomatically.andM;HP C++ AND DOMAIN/C++ 2.1 HP C++ and Domain/C++ Version 2.1 language systemsoffer advanced-programming features, such as multiple inheritance, classlibraries and source-code debugging.andP;  Because HP C++ and Domain/C++ 2.1 areobject-oriented programming languages, programmers can reuse code, reduce thecomplexity of application development and reduce code-maintenance costs.andM;INTEGRATED TOOL SET With the addition of Version 2.1 of C++ and HP's compilersolution for C++, HP has further enhanced the strong C++ offering across HPApollo and HP 9000 platforms.andM;The integrated tool set includes source-code debugging (DDE on Domain/OS andXDB on HP-UX); class-library support; a class- construction and browsing tool(HP C++Developer); a user-interface management system (HP Open Dialogue); anda development environment (HP C++/HP SoftBench).andM;HP now offers a broad range of tools and environments for object-orientedsoftware.andM;Computer                  Scheduled       U.S.andP;  ListandM;Products        Platform                  Availability    PriceandM;HP C++          HP 9000 Series 300/400    Q1 1991         $1,700andM;Version 2.1andM;HP C++          HP 9000 Series 600/800    Q1 1991          1,700andM;Version 2.1andM;(compiler)andM;HP C++          HP 9000 Series 300/400    Q2 1991          1,700andM;Version 2.1andM;(compiler)andM;Domain/C++      Motorola MC680X0-based    Q1 1991          1,615andM;Version 2.1     Apollo Series 10000andM;HP 9000 Series 400andM;C++Developer    Motorola MC680X0-basedandM;Apollo Series 10000andM;HP 9000 Series 400        Q1 1991          2,000andM;C++Developer    HP 9000 Series 300,       Now              2,000andM;400, 600, 800andM;All require Domain/OS SR10.2 or later, or HP-UX 7.0 or later.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
