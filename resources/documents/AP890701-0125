Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashirtold a government meeting broadcast on official radio. ``I willenlist the help of all experts in the quest for peace.''   El-Bashir said the peace overtures begun last month by PrimeMinister Sadek el-Mahdi, whom he toppled Friday, were ``politicalmachinations and not serious.''   The war with the mainly Christian and animist rebels in the southhas crippled the economy and led to widespread famine that hasclaimed hundreds of thousands of lives.   El-Bashir led 15 military officers in the bloodless coup, thefourth military takeover in Sudan's 33 years of independence. Thejunta, known as the National Salvation Council, imposed a state ofemergency, suspended the constitution and dissolved Parliament,political parties and unions.   Hundreds of troops guarded the streets on Saturday, stopping andsearching cars and manning barricades. Tanks and armored carsguarded the presidential palace, army headquarters and bridgesspanning the White Nile and Blue Nile that bisect the city.   Telex and telephone communications with Khartoum, cut immediatelyafter the coup, were restored. However, reporters wanting to sendstories by telex were ordered to submit their copy for``verification'' by officials.   The new regime also imposed an indefinite ban on travelingabroad. The move was believed aimed at curbing the spending of badlyneeded hard currency.   Khartoum Airport reopened for eight hours Saturday for planescarrying Moslem pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the annual pilgrimage,but it was closed to other international traffic.   Egypt on Saturday became the first country to recognize the newregime. Relations were strained during most of el-Mahdi's threeyears in power. El-Mahdi had accused Egypt of meddling in Sudan'sinternal affairs by giving shelter to Gaafar Nimeiri, the presidentousted in 1985, and approving Nimeiri's political activities inCairo.   In neighboring Chad, the official radio on Saturday welcomed themilitary coup, saying it was for the ``greatest good of Sudan andthe Sudanese people.''   El-Bashir, 44, consolidated his power on Saturday by sacking 28army generals, including Gen. Fat'hi Ahmed Ali, the commander inchief, and Gen. Babu Nimir, the chief of staff and a reputedel-Mahdi supporter.   The junta promoted el-Bashir from brigidier to lieutenantgeneral. He earlier named himself prime minister, defense ministerand armed forces commander.   Sources close to the junta said the army detained dozens ofpolitical figures after the coup, but there were conflicting reportsabout el-Mahdi's whereabouts. Egypt's Middle East News Agencyreported Saturday that el-Mahdi was in custody.   The sources did not verify that report but said the army isholding Hassan al-Turabi, head of the fundamentalist NationalIslamic Front; Idris al-Banna, a member of the disbanded StateCouncil; and Mohammed Ibrahim Nugud, secretary general of theCommunist Party.   At the meeting, el-Bashir put government undersecretaries incharge of ministries pending appointment of a new Cabinet.   He said he would scrap the peace process begun by el-Mahdi andlaunch his own peace strategy, but he gave no details.   In May, el-Mahdi opened peace talks with representatives of theSudan People's Liberation Army, led by former army Col. John Garang,the leader of the anti-government rebellion. The rebels demand moreautonomy from the mainly Moslem, northerner-controlled government.   One rebel demand was the permanent removal of harsh Islamic lawsintroduced by Nimeiri and suspended by Mahdi earlier this year.   Talks were to have been resumed Tuesday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,but the junta on Saturday indefinitely banned all official missionsabroad.   The talks were based on a tentative peace accord concluded inNovember and later endorsed by el-Mahdi under pressure from the armyand the unions.   Rebel leaders have not commented on el-Bashir's coup.   Also Saturday, the junta released more than two dozen officerswhom el-Mahdi's government arrested two weeks ago and accused ofplotting a coup.   El-Mahdi's civilian government took power in 1986, replacing atransitional military government that had been in place since the1985 coup that ousted Nimeiri.   Nimeiri last month said he would return from exile in Cairo andregain power. El-Bashir said in a statement on Friday that his couphad nothing to do with Nimeiri.</TEXT></DOC>
