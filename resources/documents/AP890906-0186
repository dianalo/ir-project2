Britain's financial ties with South Africa are of specialimportance, said Clark, who indicated at a London news conferencethat Britain's 47 Commonwealth partners will exert pressure over thelinks at a meeting next month.   Clark spoke as thousands of blacks struck in South Africa toprotest their exclusion from voting in Wednesday's nationalelection. Before the poll, President F.W. Clerk of the governingNational Party pledged reforms to give blacks a role in government.   ``If South African loans were rescheduled for say only one yearat a time, that would enable us to see how much progress is made inthe reform program. We feel that loan pressure can be an effectiveinstrument in helping the reform program,'' Clark said.   ``Talk of reform in South Africa is not in itself enough. Theremust be clear evidence that a reform program is being implemented,''he said.   Clark met earlier with Britain's Foreign Secretary John Major toexplain the decisions of the Commonwealth foreign ministerscommittee last month in Canberra, Australia. Britain is not a memberof the committee.   Clark said: ``The British position on sanctions has been clearfrom the beginning. They believe sanctions are not effective in thefight against apartheid. In my view, Britain is as committed asanyone else to the ending of apartheid.''   ``We hope that we may persuade the British government to take ahard look at the financial links with South Africa and the role ofSouth Africa in loan negotiations,'' he said.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will meet with other leaders ofthe Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies in Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia, on Oct. 18-24. The meeting is expected to assess theprospects for reform in South Africa following the general election.   Britain is the biggest foreign investor in South Africa.   The Anti-Apartheid Movement in London estimates total direct andindirect investment in South Africa by British companies at about$10.24 billion, down from $12.6 billion in 1987. Britain is SouthAfrica's third-largest trading partner behind Japan and West Germany.   More than 200 British companies have subsidiaries in South Africaand the 120 largest employ 230,000 people.   The largest of the British companies is Consolidated Gold FieldsPLC, with a 38 percent stake in Gold Fields of South Africa, whichmines gold and coal and employs 102,000 people.   Mrs. Thatcher has said mandatory economic sanctions would hurtthe black population and neighboring black states more than thegoverning white minority.   Later, a rally by about 180 anti-apartheid demonstrators inTrafalgar Square, near the South African embassy, turned violentwhen some tried to sit in the road, Scotland Yard said.   A spokesman, refusing to be named, said the problems began afterabout half the demonstrators broke away from the evening rally tomarch across the square to the embassy.   About 40 then tried to sit in the road, causing police to removethem, he said. Three people were arrested and one policeman wastaken to the hospital with broken ribs, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
