The loss is a painful one to BBDO's Los Angeles operation,which had serviced the account for more than 20 years. Likeother Los Angeles agencies fighting for business in therecession, it has had problems attracting new business, andit has suffered drastic cutbacks in ad spending from clients,such as Apple Computer Inc. and Glendale Federal Bank. Theshop, a unit of Omnicom Group Inc., last year eliminated anumber of staff positions.</LP><TEXT>   For Dailey, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos., winningthe account is a major victory because there aren't many bigclients on the West Coast. Phil Joanou, the shop's chairmanand chief executive, said the Sizzler account takes theshop's billings to about $225 million. &quot;Sizzler has been areal target account for us,&quot; he said. &quot;We've wanted it for along time.&quot;   Sizzler, a restaurant operator, put the account intoreview in large part because of disappointing sales,particularly in California where it is battling intensecompetitive pressures. &quot;We just felt that Dailey had both thedomestic and international facilities and creative prowessthat we needed to move ahead in the 1990s,&quot; said Mike MinchinJr., executive vice president of marketing at Sizzler. Inaddition to BBDO and Dailey, Sizzler also consideredChiat/Day/Mojo Inc. for its account.   Gene Cameron, president and chief executive of BBDO's WestCoast operations, said his agency will continue to work forSizzler until May 1. &quot;We gave them a plan that includedchanges in their restaurants, not just in their advertising,&quot;he said. &quot;They must've decided they couldn't do that.&quot; Hesaid combined billings at BBDO's Los Angeles and SanFrancisco offices will be about $133 million after the loss;he said no plans had yet been made for dismissals.   Dailey is one of Los Angeles's healthiest agencies, and isdifferent than most because it handles many packaged-goodsclients. It recently lost about $6 million in billings fromNeutrogena Corp. Mr. Joanou said he had double reason to bedelighted Friday; in addition to hearing of the big Sizzlerwin, it was also the opening day of the Warner Bros. film&quot;Final Analysis,&quot; a thriller that was directed by his son,who is also named Phil.</TEXT></DOC>
