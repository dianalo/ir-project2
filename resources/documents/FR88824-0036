TheSecretary will consider the public comments in determining the approvabilityof this amendment. Amendment 4 identifies additional problems that have developed in the fisheryand revises the objectives of the FMP accordingly. The annual review processfor the Tortugas sanctuary is simplified, and the Council and the Director,Southeast Region, NMFS, review deadline for the Texas closure is exendedto February 1. White shrimp taken in the EEZ are to be landed in accordancewith a State's size possession regulations to provide consistency and facilityof enforcement with the State of Louisiana. This latter action is to beimplemented at such time that Louisiana provides for an incidental catchof undersized white shrimp in the fishery for seabobs. The habitat sectionof the FMP is also updated. Proposed regulations for this amendment willbe published within 10 days. NOAA published a notice of availability on December 15, 1987 (52 FR 47615)outlining the purpose of Amendment 4 and inviting the public to comment.The Secretary returned Amendment 4 to the Council, however, because thesocioeconomic analysis of the proposed measures was inadequate.
