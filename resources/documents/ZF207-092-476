(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Moving Toward a Standard ArchitectureandM;Standard Air Force hardware contracts should ease the transition to a single,vendor-independent data architecture, Air Force officials have said.andM;One of the first steps in this process was the standard microcomputer buysthe Air Force has undertaken for the Defense Department.andP;  Since 1986, AirForce and other DOD users who want PCs have had to buy Zenith Data Systems'Z-248.andP;  The service also recently awarded contracts for standard local areanetwork equipment and minicomputer systems.andM;Because the Z-248 contract has kept prices low and is convenient to use.andP;  AirForce officials said they expect that when the contract expires next week DODusers will have ordered more than three times the 90,000 systems the AirForce initially thought were needed.andM;The service also is preparing to award a follow-on contract for standardmicros, Desktop III.andP;  The new machine will take advantage of gains inoperating systems and processor speeds, officials said.andP;  They are calling fora 32-bit machine running MS-DOS and a Posix-complaint operating system.andM;As many as 250,000 systems may be bought through the Desktop III contract,although program officials estimate the likely volume at between 150,000 and175,000.andM;In September, the Air Force awarded contracts to Electronic Data SystemsCorp. and TRW Inc. for local area network equipment.andP;  The contract, for theUnified Local Area Network Architecture (ULANA), will allow Air Force usersto select from a variety of TCP/IP products on a standard &quot;shopping list,&quot;program manager David Romanelli said.andM;The ULANA contracts may be worth up to $156 million, according to Air Forceprojections.andP;  EDS and TRW are testing ULANA equipment at Gunter Air ForceBase in Montgomery, Ala.andP;  Officials expect the equipment to become availableto users by June.andM;Late last year, the Air Force awarded a multiservice contract to ATandamp;T Co. forup to 21,000 minicomputers worth up to $929 million.andP;  ATandamp;T's machine, theenhanced 3B2/600g, supports two to 64 simultaneous users and is expandable to128 ports.andM;Interest in the program, AFCAC 251, appears high even outside of the AirForce.andP;  The Navy has delayed a solicitation for its own multiuser systembecause of user interest in the Air Force program.andM;Although users often are attracted to the convenience and economics ofordering from standard contracts, Air Force leadership has the bigger picturein mind.andP;  Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Robert H. Ludwig, the service's assistant chief ofstaff for command, control, communications and computer systems, said thecontracts will move the Air Force to an integrated architecture incorporatingindustry standards such as the Government Open Systems InterconnectionProfile and Posix.andM;&quot;In the long run, our goal is to become vendor-independent, to increasecompetition and to lower costs,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;A unique way to do that is to putthose [standard] requirements right smack dab in the specs of the hardware weare buying and enforce the use of that hardware across the Air Force.&quot;andM;Ludwig said the standard architecture will eliminate stovepipe systems in theservice and keep users from being tied to one vendor's solution.andP;  Inaddition, interoperability problems will be reduced, and users should nothave to be retrained on computers each time they are assigned to a newinstallation, he said.andM;However, Ludwig noted that the standard architecture will have itslimitations.andM;&quot;You just can't assume that a single hardware/software architecture solutionwill satisfy every damned requirement that is out there,&quot; he said.andM;Ludwig said he has granted waivers to users whose work cannot be done onstandard systems.andP;  Less than 10 percent of the systems used in the serviceare not standard, a figure that roughly corresponds to the amount of uniquework done by end users, he said.andM;When AFCAC 251, Desktop III and ULANA are in place, the service will havecompleted its standard hardware acquisition, at least until officials decideto purchase more advanced systems.andP;  Ludwig said he sees no need to buystandard mainframes or supercomputers, because those most often are used foruniqe applications.andP;  &quot;PCs, minis and LANs are as far as it will go,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
