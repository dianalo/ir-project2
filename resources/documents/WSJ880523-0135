There is none of the excitement that preceded the latest bold tax reforms in Britain and New Zealand. Indeed, a recent Gallup Poll of 38 countries found Australians had by far the gloomiest view of the near future among major nations, exceeded in their distress only by Ireland, Costa Rica and Peru.    Australia already introduced something called &quot;tax reform&quot; in September 1985, hailed somewhat prematurely in the American press as another supply-side victory. The Australian government's idea of &quot;tax reform&quot; is simply to tax every sort of useful activity at 49%. On Sept. 19, 1985, a brand-new 49% tax was applied to capital gains, which previously had been exempt.    At exactly the same time, noted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, &quot;The strong recovery of the Australian economy came to an end in the third quarter of 1985.&quot; On June 30, 1986, the government followed this up by adding a 49% &quot;fringe-benefits tax&quot; for things such as company cars. New vehicle registrations promptly fell by 23%. The corporate tax rate was increased from 46% to 49%, although significant relief from double taxation of dividends was instituted for domestic stockholders. Deductibility of entertainment expense was eliminated. The excise tax on petroleum products and other indirect taxes were increased, as was the Medicare payroll tax.    With all these new taxes, tax revenues appeared to soar 58% from 1982 to 1986, when measured in terms of the sinking Australian dollar. But that amounts to only an anemic 1.8% a year when measured in U.S. dollars. Australia needs to raise U.S. dollars, not Australian dollars, to service a foreign debt that amounts to a third of its gross domestic product.    Early in 1986, there was still hope for a significantly lower marginal tax rate on personal income. In late May 1986, however, it was learned that individual tax rates would be merely trimmed from 60% to 57%, and that this wouldn't take place until Dec. 1. Instantly, the Australian dollar collapsed, dropping against the U.S. dollar to 57 cents from 75 cents in two months, but recovering in January 1987 when tax rates were finally cut. Even then, however, Australia's new 49% tax rate kicked in at an even lower income level than the old 60% top rate did -- only 30% above average yearly earnings.    Back in 1985, the government also wanted to add a value-added tax, which may have been politically feasible if packaged with deep cuts in income tax and tariffs. But the main promise was merely to use some of the revenue to increase spending on 138 welfare programs. At one point, the government even seriously considered slapping a 30% sales tax on wedding rings. The latest idea, expected in the new minibudget, is to impose a higher tax on pensions, called &quot;superannuation.&quot; By now, Australians suspect that if the government cuts one tax rate by a few percentage points, it is only to raise another by much more.    Tariffs and import quotas are particularly burdensome. According to the OECD, the effective rate of protection in clothing and footwear increased to 220% in 1982-1983 from 64% in 1973-1974; for motor vehicles, protection increased to 147% from 41%. These tariffs make any given wage less attractive to Australian workers, contributing to high labor costs, weak incentives and underemployment. Labor and capital also are drawn out of efficient export industries, which are forced to compete for resources with protected companies (many of them foreign-owned) that are subsidized by taxing consumers.    There are other obstacles to efficiency. Minimum-wage rates and working conditions are set in minute detail by a politically appointed arbitration commission. There is a different minimum-wage rate for female process workers, another for second-class machinists, and so on. Since wage arbitration means small towns have to pay the same wages as big cities, business and people crowd into five big cities. Regulated wages -- along with taxes that claim half of any pay increase -- help explain why Australian workers seem more interested in restrictive work practices and leisure rather than more cash.    A serious tax reform would involve a top tax rate no higher than 40% at no less than five times average earnings, with that threshold indexed. Australia's corporate tax should not exceed 40%, and tax revenues would surely increase if the capitalgains tax were cut to 25%. Tariffs should be no higher than 20%. States should be given the power to levy sales taxes, in return for reduced federal funding (state politicians now get credit for spending, but bear no voter wrath for taxes).    Australian economists worry that the government can't afford to be this bold, although government deficits and debt actually are quite small. But even the government's own 1985 tax-reform paper noticed that there has been &quot;a sharp contraction in the relative contribution of tax from the upper-income range.&quot; Australia's marginal tax rate on people with only average earnings has risen to 46% from 10% over the past three decades, yet the revenues collected from those earning over 1.6 times the average has fallen to 21% from 54% of total revenues.    Since those with higher incomes paid a much larger share of the tax when marginal rates were much lower, does it not follow that a sharp reduction in Australia's higher tax rates would once again raise the income earned, reported and taxed at higher incomes?    In America, revenues from the wealthiest 1% of all taxpayers increased to 26.1% from 18.1% of total income taxes between 1981 to 1986. In the United Kingdom, the share of income tax paid by the top 5% has risen to 30% from 24% since 1979. In Australia, by contrast, the top 4.4% pay less than 14% of the tax, and the top 1% pay about 10%.    The Australian economy has awesome potential. Australia was far more affluent than the U.S. at the turn of century, and could be again. To realize that potential, however, Australia is simply going to have to look more like Hong Kong and less like Argentina. It needs to become a tax haven, complete with much freer trade and a stable currency. Will Australia ever seize the opportunity before it?    Australian voters have ousted high-tax politicians before, thus voting themselves lower tax rates and a stronger economy from 1932 to 1934, and again in 1962. Something of this sort is likely to be repeated sooner or later. Either the incumbents will change their stripes, as in 1962, or the opposition will gain office by seizing the tax issue, as in 1932. When that happens, Australia can easily double real output in two decades.    ---   Mr. Reynolds is vice president of Polyconomics in Morristown, N.J. </TEXT></DOC>
