The General Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress,said in a report this week that the department's acquisitionstrategy for the rail garrison system calls for the start ofproduction two years before development contracts have beencompleted.   This overlap between production and development, known asconcurrency, must be ``well planned and controlled,'' the GAO said,otherwise, ``it can cause cost, schedule and performance problems,as demonstrated in other Air Force acquisition programs.''   In addition, the GAO said that by March 1990, when the departmentmust make an initial production decision on the rail garrison, onlyabout two years of the system's planned four-year test program willhave been completed.   ``Most systems integration testing, all basing verificationmissile flight tests, and most of the operational test andevaluation effort will remain to be done,'' said the GAO.   The Defense Department, in comments included in the GAO report,concurred with all of the agency's findings. It added that thedepartment believes the system of launching missiles from the railsis similar to silo launches and does not require special tests.   Under the rail garrison system, 50 missiles would be placed on 25trains that would be parked inside train alert shelters in garrisonsat Air Force bases around the country. In the event of a threat, thetrains, each carrying two missiles, would move onto the nation'srailroad tracks.   The Air Force estimates that acquisition cost for the railgarrison system is about $7.4 billion.   Congress approved $440 million for research and development ofthe rail garrison program in fiscal 1987 and 1988, and appropriated$600 million in fiscal 1989. However, the Pentagon can only spend$250 million on the MX rail garrison before Feb. 15, according tothe Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal 1989.   The Feb. 15 date is the deadline for the president to decide whatto do with the remainder of the funds.   Under the system, the trains will be deployed initially at F.E.Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, and at up to 10 other possible AirForce installations.</TEXT></DOC>
