At the same time, the Treasury suggested that Congressmight want to defer consideration of broader legislationresponding to the Salomon Brothers Inc. bond scandal untilthe Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Departmentcomplete their investigations.</LP><TEXT>   Congressional approval of what once was viewed as aroutine government securities regulation bill, extending theTreasury's rule-making authority under the 1986 GovernmentSecurities Act, has been delayed as lawmakers ponder how torespond to the Salomon scandal.   The Treasury retains authority to regulate its securitiesauctions under a 1917 law, officials said.   The Treasury, which stated its position in a letter fromAssistant Secretary Mary Sophos to key lawmakers, appears tobe siding with the Senate in intramural jockeying over thetiming of action on government-securities legislation.   Last month, the Senate approved a narrow bill making itunlawful under the federal securities laws to use false orinaccurate information in making bids in the Treasuryauctions. The measure provides a one-year extension of theTreasury's rule-making authority to give policy makers plentyof time to assess the Salomon scandal and considerlegislative responses.   The House hasn't taken any action yet, but key memberswant to pass a comprehensive bill this year responding to theSalomon situation. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of theHouse Telecommunications and Finance subcommittee, plans tounveil a bill at a hearing this Friday at whichrepresentatives of the Treasury, SEC and Federal Reserve areslated to testify.   The three agencies currently are making a joint review ofthe government market. Their recommendations are due in earlyDecember.   Rep. Markey's bill will propose that the Treasury'srule-making authority be extended. It also is expected topropose that the SEC be given authority to oversee the mannerin which bond price and trading information gets to thepublic and regulators; to give the SEC primacy in settingsales-practice rules for the government market; to proposestandard internal procedures to guard against abuses bygovernment-securities dealers; and to makegovernment-securities abuses explicit violations of federalsecurities laws.</TEXT></DOC>
