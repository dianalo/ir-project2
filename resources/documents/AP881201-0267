Six weeks after jumping into the fray to protect his``franchise'' on leveraged buyouts, King Henry is still on top.   At 44, Kravis is the highest profile member of the partnership ofKohlberg Kravis andamp; Roberts Co., which is credited with making theleveraged buyout technique a powerful factor in the biggest takeoverbinge in American history.   The partnership's apparent victory in the unprecedented auctionfor RJR Nabisco _ with a bid exceeding $24.5 billion _ joins othercrown jewels in Kohlberg Kravis's expanding showcase of corporateacquisitions.   Before the food and tobacco gem came Beatrice Cos., for 6.1billion in 1986; Safeway Stores Inc., for $4.2 billion the sameyear; Storer Communications Inc. for $2.5 billion in 1985; and Stopandamp; Shop Cos., for $1.2 billion in 1988, among others.   Kohlberg Kravis is the undisputed leader in LBOs, in which it andother investors put up a small amount of money and borrows the rest,repaying the debt with the acquired company's earnings, the sale ofassets or both.   In the past 10 years, Kravis has spent more than $38 billionacquiring about 35 companies. Investors in the firm's growing LBOinvestment fund have earned about 40 percent returns in the process,and Kohlberg Kravis has become manager of a huge conglomerate.   The man at the top of the heap of all that debt _ and power _ isKravis, an Oklahoma boy who has found a home on Wall Street and thesocial circles of Manhattan.   Married to a glamorous fashion designer, Carolyne Roehm, Kravislives a life straight out of Tom Wolfe's novel ``The Bonfire of theVanities.'' While he works incessantly, he finds time to dash out tokey dates on the party circuit and entertain guests at hisConnecticut estate, where _ rumor has it _ the smell of fresh-bakedcroissants is piped into the guestrooms every morning.   ``It's a high-voltage existence,'' his wife said in an interviewwith Newsweek magazine earlier this year.   At work, Kravis was the protege of Jerome Kohlberg, who left thefold last year after a falling out with Kravis and George Roberts,the other major partner. The principal point of disagreement betweenKohlberg and his partners was the size of deals the firm shouldpursue.   Kravis and Roberts stand ready to scale ever more challengingheights. Although the RJR Nabisco buyout carries more than $20billion in debt, Kravis believes the deal is still conservative.   The amount of equity in the acquired company is estimated atabout $7.4 billion, for a debt-to-equity ratio of 3-to-1. In termsof leveraged buyouts, that is considered low, Kravis said Thursday.   The deal was an even more critical measure of Kravis's personaland professional prestige _ which is why he entered the bidding insuch a brazen way in the first place.   After RJR Nabisco chief executive F. Ross Johnson first announcedhis plan to take the company private Oct. 20, Kravis rushed to makehis own proposal. Initially, he tried to call off Johnson'sfinancial advisers, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., in a meeting inwhich Kravis offered to top Johnson's bid to ``protect hisfranchise.''   Kravis's overtures were greeted with a flat rejection from themanagement group and the bidding war was on.   If Kravis succeeds in adding RJR Nabisco's tobacco and foodholdings to his stable, the LBO kingdom will boast revenues of $50billion or more _ about the same as blue-chip International BusinessMachines Corp.   ``There's a sense of one-upmanship in the financial markets,''said one stock analyst early on in the battle for RJR Nabisco.``These people want to say, `We've done the biggest deal ... We'rethe best.'''   For the moment, King Henry is just that.</TEXT></DOC>
