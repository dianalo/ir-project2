The managers, with financier Gordon Cain's Sterling Group as anequity financing partner, expect to complete the deal by Aug. 5.   The deal was negotiated with BNS Inc., a takeover group composedof British industrialist Brian Beazer, the Wall Street investmentbank Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank.   BNS completed a $1.8 billion tender offer for Koppers June 15.   Cain will serve as chairman, and Glen Tenley, who was presidentand chief operating officer of Koppers, will serve as president andchief executive of the business, to be known as Koppers Chemical Co.   The new company, with annual sales of about $600 million inchemicals and wood products, will remain headquartered inPittsburgh.   Beazer wanted Koppers for its building materials businesses,which he added to his own international operations in the sameindustry.   He had intended to sell the chemicals and related businesses tohelp finance the takeover, and he gave the Pittsburgh-basedmanagers exclusive right to negotiate for the units.   The 6-year-old Sterling Group has completed 20 leveragedbuyouts, about one-third in the chemical industry. Tenley, 60, is a33-year veteran of the chemicals business.   The size of Cain's equity stake in the new company is ``amongthe details to be worked out,'' said Koppers spokesman RobertO'Gara.   ``I'm not sure how much of that is going to be made public. Thisis going to be a private corporation,'' he said.   The other major unresolved issue is personnel, O'Gara said.   The chemicals businesses employ about 4,000 people at 25 plantsaround the country. All but 50 of the 1,150 employees at Koppers'headquarters work for the chemicals businesses, and Beazer has yetto pick the employees he wants to hire for the constructionmaterials operations, O'Gara said.   The parties hope to resolve both issues in the next four weeks,he said.   ``Our cash flow is strong, and the outlook for the Kopperschemical business is good,'' Tenley said in a statement.   ``We are confident of our ability to grow to a $1 billion salesorganization by the early 1990s, and we will add that growththrough expansion of quality programs in our businesses and byserving our customer base with new products and services,'' he said.   Local government officials had pressed for Beazer to keepKoppers in Pittsburgh, and Beazer said the buyout ``constitutes thefulfillment of our pledge'' to give local management an edge innegotiating for the businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
