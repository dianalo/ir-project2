The Hezbi Islami Party, led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, said in astatement that the Darwazgai garrison at Shinki district in theZabul province fell Saturday after several days of fighting.   It quoted ``a wireless report'' from guerrillas in the area.   It said 10 guerrillas had died and 18 others were wounded.Several mortars, guns, pistols, anti-aircraft guns, wireless setsand uniforms also were seized in the operation, the report said.   The report of the capture comes only days after the signing inGeneva of a U.N.-mediated Soviet troop withdrawal accord.   The guerrillas, who were not party to the Geneva agreement, havesaid they will not be bound by any accord in which they did notparticipate. They have vowed to continue the fight until theCommunist regime in Kabul is toppled.   According to Western diplomatic sources, the Afghan war hasintensified in recent weeks despite the signing of the accord.There seems to be no indication the guerrillas will let up theirattacks.   Since Thursday, Afghan President Najib has been making dailyappeals to the guerrillas to join a coalition government and endthe conflict so millions of refugees can return home from Iran andPakistan.   The rebels have said they will not share power with theCommunists in any future government.</TEXT></DOC>
