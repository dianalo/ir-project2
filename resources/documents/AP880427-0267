In the letter, association Executive Director F. Hagen McMahonJr. and President Scott Smith of Sherman's American Bank protestedthe unlimited insurance provision and a greater willingness byregulators to close ailing small banks rather than rescue them.   They accused the FDIC of slandering and threatening themanagement of independent banks closed by regulators, while publicstatements about First RepublicBank's troubles blamed outsideeconomic forces rather than management.   ``Let us point out that our bankers live in the same economy asthe bankers working for First RepublicBank,'' Smith and McMahonwrote.   Normally, the FDIC insures individual deposits up to $100,000.   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said the full-insurance solution forFirst RepublicBank was the best one under the circumstances toensure the safety of the Texas banking industry. But heacknowledged the guarantee causes disparity among the state's banks.   Texas has 1,400 independent banks, each averaging $44 million indeposits, according to figures compiled by the banking association.   Of the 71 Texas banks closed in 1987 and 1988, all but a handfulwere independent, so a slight influx in deposits from troubledlarger banks is small comfort to most independent bankers.   ``I would say that the independent banking community _ for thelack of a better word _ has benefited, or our deposits haveincreased, due to the problems that the larger banks are having,''said McMahon.   Last month, the association's bankers reported they not onlywere gaining deposits from the First RepublicBank system, butpeople were also moving safe-deposit boxes.   ``Any time that a customer will go to the trouble of moving hissafe-deposit box, that is a good indication that core deposits areflowing into our banks, not just temporary hot-money movement,''McMahon said.   But those added deposits could be a mixed blessing as demand forloans continues to drop in Texas, said Stephen Skaggs, a vicepresident at Alex Sheshunoff andamp; Co., a leading bank consulting firmin Austin.   ``It could be an opportunity for a financially healthy, soundbank which has loan demand to profitably make use of the depositgrowth that comes from the troubled banks in the state,'' Skaggssaid. ``But growth in and of itself without having a way to deploythose deposits is not necessarily advantageous.   ``If you don't have anywhere to put the money and suddenly yougrow by $20 million, then what's really the advantage?''   But where loan demand does exist, larger independents with moneyto lend hope they can fill the lending void left by ailing holdingcompanies.   ``Out-of-state lenders are scared to make loans or invest here,and the major Texas people have their hands tied,'' said RichardWare II, president of Amarillo National Bank, one of the state'sbiggest independents.   Ware's bank, owned and operated by his family for fourgenerations, works with other independents to assemble large loandeals that his bank, with assets of $630.8 million, would not beable to do on its own.   Ware said while his bank's profits are down, the bank remainsprofitable because its loan portfolio lacks the heavy exposure inreal estate loans that burned it big-city counterparts.   The rush toward real estate lending by most holding companiesillustrates a strength of independent banking _ independentthinking, he said.   ``This concentration (of lenders) all starts thinking one way,and they all went into real estate lending and it got 'em,'' Waresaid. ``So I think there's some strength in the independent conceptin that you're diversified, you have different management, you havedifferent deposit bases. That's a strength that will allow us toget through this.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday April 28</NOTE></DOC>
