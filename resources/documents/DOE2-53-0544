This was essentially accomplished by July 1, 1988.We have also made progress on the reactions of metal carbonyl anionswith metal carbonyl cations and metal carbonyl dimers. Reactions of Re(CO){sub5}{sup -} with Mn(CO){sub 6}{sup +}, phosphine, inorganic complexes andorganometallic halides are discussed. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
