The oil-price collapse that threw thousands of educated and motivated professionals out of work appears to have set the stage for a new entrepreneurial wave on the Texas Gulf Coast.    Only a handful of cities are developing small businesses at a faster rate than Houston, says David Birch, president of Cognetics Inc., an economic and marketing consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. Mr. Birch, who also is director of the Program on Neighborhood and Regional Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been tracking business-formation trends since 1969.    He says the entrepreneurial zeal now on display in Houston was predictable and little different from the small-business boomlets that occurred in Boston, Seattle and Detroit after industrial recessions or layoffs rocked those communities.    &quot;One of the responses to crisis is entrepreneurship,&quot; says Mr. Birch. People thrown out of work have four options: finding a new job, staying unemployed, leaving the area or starting a business of their own. The latter course has taken hold in Houston.    THE RESULT, when the debris is sorted out, will be a more diversified economy than the one that made Houston a petroleum-industry center. &quot;People are setting up medical labs, testing facilities, financial-software companies. They're taking the expertise they developed in the oil industry and making that their profession,&quot; says Mr. Birch. &quot;It's sort of like a forest fire. The ashes of the catastrophe are the fertilizer for the next growth.&quot;    As evidence, Mr. Birch points to a couple of indicators. Ranked by the number of new businesses started in the four years 1982-1985, Houston ranks fourth nationally behind Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago.    A better measure may be the percentage of &quot;significant startups&quot; -- new companies that had 10 or more employees at the end of the four-year period. Houston was sixth of 239 areas. Above it on the list were Phoenix, Ariz., and four other Texas cities less directly affected by the oil-industry recession: Austin, Dallas, El Paso and San Antonio.    Mr. Birch says it will take a while to see results of the small-business surge. &quot;I'm not bullish on Houston now, but I'm bullish five or six years from now,&quot; he says.    ---   OHIO'S LEGISLATURE SHIFTS the state's presidential primary election date from May to the third Tuesday in March, matching the primary day in nearby Illinois. Ohio's move may encourage other neighboring states to create a Great Lakes, or Midwest, regional presidential primary, similar to the &quot;super primary&quot; that 13 Southern states have fashioned for the second week of March. Wisconsin, Indiana and Pennsylvania are potential partners.    State Sen. Stanley Aronoff, the sponsor of Ohio's primary election bill, deplores the trend toward earlier selection of delegates to presidential nominating conventions. &quot;It's craziness, but as long as everyone's jumping the gun, there's no choice unless you want to be left at the gate.&quot; He notes that Ohio Sen. John Glenn's presidential hopes in 1984 weren't helped by the fact that 16 states held primary ballots, beginning in February, and many others held party caucuses before voters in Mr. Glenn's home state got a chance to vote in early May. Ohio's new earlier primary date &quot;is a matter of survival,&quot; Sen. Aronoff says.    ---   ALASKA'S PERMANENT FUND this year declared its largest-ever annual citizen dividend. Since 1976, Alaska has used oil and gas revenues to build a nest egg against the day when the wells run dry. Slightly less than one-third of the interest on the fund's principal, now $7.78 billion, is divided each year among state residents.    Starting in October, checks for $556.26, the largest dividend since a special $1,000 payout at the fund's beginning, were mailed to some 532,000 Alaskans. The dividends give the state economy a quickie infusion of nearly $300 million in disposable income.    ---   FORT WORTH, TEXAS, bests three other communities in competition for the first U.S.-currency printing plant outside Washington, D.C. The Treasury Department wanted a site west of the Mississippi with direct air service to more than three dozen cities in the Federal Reserve System's San Francisco, Dallas and Kansas City districts. Others in the final four were Las Vegas, Nev.; Aurora, Colo., and Pierce County, Wash. Each offered the Treasury free land and buildings in an attempt to lure the bill printing plant.    ---   ENERGY-STATE CREDIT RATINGS get bumped. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. in the third quarter lowered 15 Colorado municipal-bond credit ratings, seven in Louisiana, and two in Oklahoma. None of these states had a bond upgrade. Five Texas bonds were knocked, while three had credit improvements. The slide in energy-state bond ratings runs counter to a trend toward credit upgrades for local-government bonds across most of the U.S.    ---   BRIEFS: A new Maryland law says automobile dealers can't stick their ad logos on new and used cars without the buyer's permission. . . . Charlotte, N.C., is in &quot;Central America,&quot; says an ad campaign aimed at ending confusion over the city's location. . . . Eureka, Mo., is selected as the site of the Dog Museum of America. </TEXT></DOC>
