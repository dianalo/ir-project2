<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0464 </DOCNO><TEXT>The invention relates to a rechargeable high temperature electrochemicalcell having a molten sodium anode, a molten halide salt liquid electrolyte,a compatible cathode in contact with the liquid electrolyte, and a beta-aluminasolid electrolyte between the anode and liquid electrolyte is non-acidicand contains sodium cations as its only alkali metal cations, aluminiumcations, as its only alkali metal cations, aluminium cations, and chlorideanions. The electrolyte is doped with fluoride anions to combat progressivelyincreasing internal resistance of the cell associated with cyclic chargingand discharging thereof.</TEXT></DOC>
