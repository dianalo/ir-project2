David Pryor, D-Ark., said in preparedremarks at a hearing of a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee.   ``Congress has been so disappointed in the testing office thatsome have spoken of eliminating it.'   ``Six years after setting up the testing office, America is stillsending poorly tested weapons to the troops and spending billionsdue to misleading or incomplete test reports,'' he said.   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., added in a statement that ``it isno secret that the (testing) office has been a terribledisappointment to many members of Congress.''   The staff of the federal services subcommittee chaired by Pryorcompiled a report on the Pentagon's Office of Operational Test andEvaluation, the top weapons testing office. Data came from theGeneral Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency, fromthe Defense Department's inspector general, and from other sources.   ``Contractors with ties to weapons being tested regularly reviewtest plans, analyze test results and and prepare test reports,''Pryor said.   TRW Inc. and Science Applications International Corp. or SAIChave been hired under an $85 million contract to provide a widevariety of technical support `` across the full spectrum of test andevaluation activity,'' the report said.   TRW is the 11th largest weapons supplier to the Pentagon and thefourth largest contractor working on the Strategic DefenseInitiative, the report noted.   The testing office insists that its staff is making all thedecisions and the firms are merely providing support, but the reportsaid TRW has ``contact with a wide variety of other DoD projects andcontractors ... (and) it is difficult to understand how this firmcan be used to perform objective, independent operational testing.''   At the Cleveland headquarters of TRW, the firm's media relationsoffice said everyone who could comment was traveling.   Frank C. Conahan, assistant comptroller general in the GeneralAccounting Office, told the panel that ``testing has not beencomprehensive, realistic or rigorous; nor has there been sufficientoversight of the testing and evaluation function by top management''of the Defense Department.   To improve testing, Conahan said officials in his agency``strongly support the need for having some ... results availableearly in the acquisition process before production commitments aremade.''   John E. Krings, the head of the 50-person office who hasannounced he is retiring, defended the testing operation, saying thePentagon ``has made tremendous strides'' to ensure that equipmentsent to the troops is safe and effective.   He cited a number of cases in which organized tests have affectedweapons, but he said some weapons can't be ``subjected to full upoperational testing until a considerable monetary commitment hasbeen made.'' Congress has not always been forthcoming with themoney, he said.   While he praised the goal of an independent testing office,Krings said, ``The price of independence is a constant attack fromthose who would leave you independent from all but them.''</TEXT></DOC>
