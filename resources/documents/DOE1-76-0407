There hasbeen a steady increase in drilling in oil plays of the deepwater Gulfof Mexico and in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico. Butnatural gas drilling has not seen much of an increase, although activityinvolving Miocne sands in the shallow water portion of the gulf is startingto pick up. Deep gas drilling, stalled by the 1986 spot price collapse,has not yet shown signs of new life, even though production is scheduledto begin this year from the Jurassic Norphlet deep gas play off Alabama.There should be continued increases this year in deepwater and Permianbasin drilling if oil prices remain in the $18-20/bbl range. And gasdrilling is expected to pick up considerably if spot prices strengthen.An important factor in the drilling outlook is an expectation that majorinterstate transmission companies this year will resume buying long termgas supplies for resale. Long term contracts reduce producer uncertaintyin project economics.</TEXT></DOC>
