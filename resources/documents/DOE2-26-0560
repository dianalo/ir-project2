The magnetic energy stored in them is usuallydischarged into an external electrical resistance for faults in operation.One must investigate theoretically and experimentally whether and howsystem faults could lead to a deposition of this energy inside a magnetcoil and whether local destruction of the magnet must be expected. Ifthere were an arc, there is the danger of the destruction of adjacentcomponents of the magnet system. The preparation of the conceivable faultscenario, fault detection and identification, the investigation of thebehaviour of a magnet system after faults have occurred and the developmentof measures to limit the damage form the catalogue of subjects for thestarted program for investigating the safety of magnets and for designingsafer magnet systems.</TEXT></DOC>
