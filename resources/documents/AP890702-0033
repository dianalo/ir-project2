Bush, who is no relation to the presidentbut was the finance director for both his 1980 and 1988 presidentialcampaigns.   ``And if he goes, it may just be as a visitor,'' Dole quipped.   Frederick Bush was questioned extensively last Thursday and inMay by the House Government Operations Committee about hundreds ofthousands of dollars in consultant fees which his lobbying firm,Bush andamp; Co., reaped in 1986 and 1987 for HUD projects in Puerto Rico.   In the testimony, Frederick Bush acknowledged he had contactedpolitical appointees at HUD but said he did not feel that he had``political influence'' with them because of his campaign efforts onbehalf of George Bush or his job as deputy director of the vicepresident's staff from 1982 to 1984.   ``I made the distinction between what I call political access andpolitical influence,'' the 40-year-old ambassador-designate told theHouse panel.   Dole, interviewed on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' program, said hewas not urging the president to withdraw Frederick Bush's nomination.   ``I'll support the president,'' Dole said, adding, ``but I thinkyou've got to be realistic in this business. I don't believe ... theSenate Foreign Relations Committee (is) going to be in any hurry toconfirm his nomination or to report his nomination favorably.''</TEXT></DOC>
