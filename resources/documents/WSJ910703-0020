Keating Jr.and associates were abruptly halted yesterday when lawyersfor the former chairman of American Continental Corp. saidthey were asking a federal judge to cancel the one-day-oldsession.   The lawyers contend that the OTS hearings are interferingwith defense preparations for a California state-court trialset to start Aug. 2. In that case, Mr. Keating and otherformer officers of Phoenix, Ariz.-based American Continental,and of its former California thrift unit, Lincoln Savings andamp;Loan Association, are charged with criminal fraud counts inthe sale of American Continental bonds.</LP><TEXT>   If the OTS hearings continue, Mr. Keating is expected tobe one of the first witnesses called, although he is expectedto exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and to refuse totestify. The federal government has alleged in civillitigation that Mr. Keating and others used Lincoln toprovide money for their personal benefit.   Lincoln was seized in April 1989, a day after its parentfiled for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcylaws. The bailout of Lincoln, since acquired by Great WesternSavings, Beverly Hills, is expected to cost taxpayers $2.6billion.</TEXT></DOC>
