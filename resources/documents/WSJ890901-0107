The Swedish auto maker and Ford didn't deny Swedish press and television reports that they are in serious negotiations; however, a Saab-Scania spokesman declined to comment on the reports.    A Ford spokesman called the reports about the talks &quot;speculation,&quot; and wouldn't comment further. Ford is, however, interested in acquiring a luxury European nameplate at some point, company officials say privately. While Saab may be one possibility, another is Britain's Jaguar PLC. The prospect of a shakeout among European auto makers in the early 1990s may provide a prime opportunity, these Ford officials say.    The attraction for Ford would be to obtain an upscale brand that could broaden the appeal of its product lines both in the U.S. and in Europe. Ford has tried to accomplish that in the U.S. by importing some of its existing European cars under the Merkur nameplate, but sales of those cars have been slow.    Saab-Scania's Saab car division had a loss of 450 million Swedish krona ($68 million) for this year's first four months. Saab-Scania officials blamed most of the divison's woes on slumping sales in the U.S., Saab's biggest single market. </TEXT></DOC>
