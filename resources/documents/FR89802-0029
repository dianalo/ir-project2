Management measures for 1989were effective on May 1, 1989 (54 FR 19798, May 8, 1989). This notice announcesinseason actions affecting the two ocean salmon fisheries below.(1) <T3>Recreational fishery from the U.S.-Canada border to the Queets River,Washington.</T3> Regulations governing the ocean salmon fisheries at 50CFR Part 661 specify at andSection; 661.21(a)(1) that ``When a quota forthe commercial or the recreational fishery, or both, for any salmon speciesin any portion of the fishery management area is projected by the RegionalDirector to be reached on or by a certain date, the Secretary will, bynotice issued under andSection; 661.23, close the commercial or recreationalfishery, or both, for all salmon species in the portion of the fisherymanagement area to which the quota applies as of the date the quota isprojected to be reached.''The 1989 recreational fishery for all salmon species in the subarea fromthe U.S.-Canada border to the Queets River, Washington, commenced on July2, 1989, and was scheduled to continue through the earliest of September28, 1989 or the attainment of either a subarea quota of 22,500 coho salmonor an overall quota of 47,500 chinook salmon north of Cape Falcon, Oregon.Based on the best available information, the recreational fishery catchin the subarea is projected to reach the 22,500 coho salmon quota by midnight,July 26, 1989. Therefore, the fishery in this subarea is closed to furtherrecreational fishing effective 2400 hours local time, July 26, 1989.(2) <T3>Recreational fishery from Cape Falcon to Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon.</T3>The 1989 recreational fishery south of Cape Falcon, Oregon, is managednot to exceed 285,000 coho salmon. If the recreational coho quota is reached,the subarea between Cape Falcon and Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, closesto recreational fishing for all salmon species, and the recreational salmonfishery south of Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, remains open for all salmonspecies as regularly scheduled.The entire area south of Cape Falcon currently is open to recreationalfishing for all salmon species. According to the best available informationthrough July 23, about 85,000 fish remain in the 285,000 recreational cohoquota. At expected catch rates, the coho quota will be reached and thefishery in the subarea from Cape Falcon to Orford Reef Red Buoy will beclosed well ahead of its scheduled ending date of September 15. A shortenedrecreational fishing week in this subarea is expected to dampen catch rates,provide additional opportunity to harvest coho and chinook salmon, andprolong the recreational fishery.Regulations at andSection; 661.21(b)(1)(iii) authorize inseason changes inthe recreational fishing days per calendar week. Therefore, the fishingweek for the recreational fishery in the subarea from Cape Falcon to OrfordReef Red Buoy, Oregon, is shortened to Sunday through Thursday only, effective2400 hours local time, July 27, 1989.In accordance with the revised inseason notice procedures of andSection;andSection;661.20, 661.21, and 661.23, actual notice to fishermen was given priorto (1) 2400 hours local time, July 26, 1989 for the recreational closurebetween the U.S.-Canada border and the Queets River, Washington, and (2)2400 hours local time, July 27, 1989 for the shortened recreational fishingweek between Cape Falcon and Orford Reef Red Buoy, Oregon, by telephonehotline number (206) 526-6667 and by U.S. Coast Guard Notice to Marinersbroadcasts on Channel 16 VHF-FM and 2182 KHz.The Regional Director consulted with representatives of the Pacific FisheryManagement Council, Washington Department of Fisheries, Oregon Departmentof Fish and Wildlife, and California Department of Fish and Game regardingthis action. The states of Washington and Oregon will manage the salmonfisheries in State waters adjacent to these areas of the EEZ in accordancewith this federal action. This notice does not apply to other fisherieswhich may be operating in other areas.Because of the need for immediate action, the Secretary of Commerce hasdetermined that good cause exists for this notice to be issued withoutaffording a prior opportunity for public comment.
