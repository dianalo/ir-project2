BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaders of this week's ``Siege of Atlanta''begged for more people to attend today's demonstrations during thefinal day of anti-abortion protests after a dramatic drop inattendance.   The pleas apparently paid off, because about 50 people werearrested today in two waves of protests at the Midtown Hospital.   The Rev. Joseph Foreman, regional director of the New York-basedanti-abortion group Operation Rescue, told about 40 people at arally Thursday night to gather early today for a private strategysession.   ``We've gotten predictable,'' Foreman said earlier at a rally atSt. Jude the Apostle Roman Catholic Church.   Atlanta police first arrested 33 demonstrators early today forblocking clinic entrances, as some patients had to be taken overpolice barricades to get inside, according to witnesses. Later,about 20 more demonstrators were taken into custody.   Police did not show the force this morning that they have usedthis week, instead asking the protesters to walk to police buses``like gentlemen and ladies.'' When the demonstrators refused, theywere carried _ but not dragged _ off the clinic property and intothe buses.   Several dozen supporters stood on the sidelines singing hymns.   The demonstrations, part of a week of protests dubbed ``TheSiege of Atlanta,'' began Tuesday, when 343 of an estimated 800protesters were arrested. Since then, participation both in thedaytime demonstrations outside the clinics and nighttime rallieshas fallen steadily.   Only 14 people were arrested Wednesday and 11 Thursday. Therallies have dwindled from 1,000 people Monday to fewer than 250Thursday.   Speakers at Thursday's rally repeatedly begged for more peopleto attend the demonstrations, either to risk arrest or provide``prayer support.''   ``I'm pleading with you before the Lord to come with us tomorrowwhether you plan to `rescue' or not,'' Operation Rescue headRandall Terry said Thursday. Terry and other leaders say they arenot demonstrating, but are ``rescuing'' fetuses from being killedbefore they are born.   Despite the shrinking numbers, protest leaders maintain they areshutting down clinics temporarily and preventing abortions frombeing performed. Clinic operators deny that claim, saying the onlydisruption has been in some rescheduled abortions.   Protest leaders also have complained about police brutality,mainly during Tuesday's arrests, and charge that police aredeliberately preventing protesters from from getting out of jail.   But many of those arrested have refused to give their realnames, calling themselves instead Baby Jane Doe or Baby John Doe,officials said.   That identification tactic was used in earlier protests, withdemonstrators saying they were expressing solidarity with what theycalled the anonymous victims of abortion. Authorities have refusedto release protesters who don't give their real names.   Of the 368 arrested during the first three days, police saidThursday that 30 had made bond, which was set at $650.   To combat the demonstrations, Atlanta's seven clinics thatperform abortions have cooperated by shifting patients from oneclinic to another, or helping provide escorts through thedemonstrators.   Members of Operation Rescue first appeared in Atlanta during theDemocratic National Convention in July, and stayed in town for muchof the summer. Since the protests began, more than 1,100anti-abortion protesters have been jailed, mostly on trespassingcharges.   The Most Rev. Eugene Marino, archbishop of Atlanta, has endorsedthe group's efforts.   In San Francisco, a federal appeals court Thursday refused tooverturn an injunction prohibiting anti-abortion activists inPortland from physically intimidating patrons of a health clinic oryelling loud enough to disrupt business inside.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that the injunctionby a U.S. District Court magistrate in Portland does not abridgeFirst Amendment rights of free speech and is not too vague.   Advocates for Life, a non-profit corporation that engages inabortion protests, appealed the ruling.</TEXT></DOC>
