We have accumulation of about an inch on mostof the roads.''   A wintry storm bedeviled the Deep South on Monday with sleet andfreezing rain, and another onslaught of cold air from Canadaadvanced through the Plains today. In Illinois this morning, Peoriaand Springfield received about 4 inches of snow, with an inchreported in the Chicago area.   In Colorado, motorists slipping and sliding along icy,snow-packed roads deluged the Rocky Mountain AAA Auto Club with 100to 150 calls an hour for tow trucks.   Ski resort operators, meanwhile, were a very happy lot.   ``We're set up for the rest of the season,'' said Barb Jennings,spokeswoman at a Steamboat Springs ski lodge, where storms havedumped 110 inches of powder in the last nine days. ``We're ready todo some powder skiing.''   On Monday, the storm iced roads from Mississippi to theCarolinas. There were scores of minor accidents, and traffic cameto a standstill in many areas. ``If you had a cardiac now it couldbe a matter of living or dying because of the roads,'' said policedispatcher Ronnie Toliver in Little Rock, Ark.   The cold has been blamed for nine traffic deaths and 31 otherfatalities since Friday, among them Atlanta Falcons player BradBeckman, who was killed Monday in a crash on icy Interstate 85outside Atlanta.   The fatalities also included a homeless man who set himself onfire in a New York City subway station while using a hotplate tokeep warm, and an 86-year-old found dead, apparently of exposure,in the driveway of her Birmingham, Mich., home.   In Chicago, a man got stuck in the ventilator shaft at arestaurant, apparently during a burglary attempt, and died ofexposure, police said.   In Apalachin, N.Y., a woman accused of pouring water on her7-year-old foster daughter and leaving her outside as thetemperature dipped to 5 degrees was charged Monday with murder.Police said Lisa Braden, 36, put the girl outside as punishment.   Dickinson, N.D., reported a record 23-below zero this morning.Bismarck reached minus 34, two degrees above the record. Denver'sStapleton International Airport reported a record 10 below-zeroreading, one degree below the previous record set in 1924.   In Youngstown, Ohio, the temperature dipped to minus 3 thismorning, breaking a record of 2 below set in 1963. Monday's readingof 12 below also set a record.   Record-breaking cold gripped at least 11 cities Monday,including Pittsburgh, minus 7, and Lexington, Ky., 1 below. Theoutlook for most of the country is for below-average temperaturesfor the next month or so, according to the National Weather Service.   With even the desert Southwest expecting relatively chilly60-degree temperatures, South Florida is the only hot spot. Miami'sforecast called for highs in the 80s today.   Though winter doesn't officially begin until Thursday, iceforced closure of a 200-mile stretch of the Mississippi River tobarge traffic from Cairo, Ill., to St. Louis. The ice compoundednavigation problems posed by low water that has plagued bargeoperators because of the summer's drought, the Coast Guard said inannouncing the closure Monday night.   This is the slowest time of year for shipping on the Mississippi.   The Missouri River turned to ice for the 75 miles between Blair,Neb., just north of Omaha, and Sioux City, Iowa, the weatherservice reported.   The ice jam began late Friday and has continued to grow.Officials feared that the freeze could cause problems forcommunities that pump their water from the river, and WeatherService hydrologist Roy Osugi didn't hold out hope for an earlythaw.   ``Nothing is going to bust it up except warmer weather,'' Osugisaid. ``We think it's going to stay in place at least this weekbecause it's going to stay very cold.''   In St. Joseph, Mo., officials activated a new emergency pump asa precaution to keep water flowing to the city.   Some merchants welcomed the chill, saying it drove people towarm indoor malls and shops.   ``Were selling lots of mufflers, outerwear, coats and gloves,''said Robert Spevak, senior vice president at the Alexander'sdepartment store in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
