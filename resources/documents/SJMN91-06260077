And what happened Sunday before 59,148 fans at the Metrodome was nojoke.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NO JOKE: 49ERS FALL TO 1-2VIKINGS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF S.F. MISTAKES, WIN 17-14  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Vikings 17, 49ers 14; See also related stories on pages 1D and 7-8D of thissection.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The Minnesota Vikings, looking crisp and confident, took advantage of every49ers foible and flaunted their own mental superiority, winning 17-14 andforcing plenty of questions in the visitors' locker room.;   Why eightpenalties for 60 yards in the third week of regular-season play?;   Why thenumerous missed tackles from a veteran defense?;   Why all the missedoffensive assignments, such as the ones that led to an interception at theVikings' 2, a blocked field goal and a fumble on the Vikings' 11?;   What'severybody thinking?;   &quot;I don't know, but we're not thinking together,&quot; guardGuy McIntyre said, shaking his head and contemplating the awful unfamiliarityof a 1-2 record, something the 49ers haven't experienced since thestrike-shortened 1982 season, when they finished 3-6.;   Running back SpencerTillman was more direct.;   &quot;When I first got here, after a loss, we had guysthrowing up in the locker room,&quot; said Tillman, who joined the club in 1989.;  &quot;I'm not questioning the commitment of our players. I just think some of theguys who have been here, who expect to win, need to bring that out and give itto the younger guys, the guys who are asking, 'Where's that 49ers mystiquewe've heard about?' &quot;;   Ouch. But the fact is, the 49ers look wayward, andthey know it.;   &quot;The fact that we threw an interception when we were in thered zone, or in the scoring territory, and the fact that we fumbled when wewere in scoring territory, and the fact that we had a field goal blocked --that was just too much for us to overcome,&quot; 49ers Coach George Seifert said.;  Field day for Anthony Carter; That the 49ers' injury-ravaged defensivesecondary was exploited by the Vikings (2-1) was no shocker, but Minnesotawide receiver Anthony Carter had a field day, catching three passes for 71yards, including a 46-yard scoring reception from Wade Wilson, and rushing for41 yards in two end-arounds. Running back Herschel Walker added 72 yards in 25carries and caught three passes for 26 yards.;   49ers quarterback Steve Youngwas spotted all over his side of the field, scrambling to escape a viciousVikings pass rush. He completed 19 of 27 passes for 275 yards and twotouchdowns, both to Jerry Rice, but a second-quarter interception marred hisperformance.;   Rice misses some passes  Rice, whose four receptions accountedfor 85 of the 49ers' 355 total yards, also wasn't without blame, dropping anumber of throws.;   &quot;That one thing -- that's really an example of whathappened today, so many things not going right,&quot; he said of the missedreceptions.;   Early on, though, things weren't going right for Minnesota, and49ers cornerback Kevin Lewis appeared to be a hero.;   On the first play ofthe Vikings' third offensive series, he intercepted a pass by Wilson thatdeflected off fullback Alfred Anderson's hands at the Vikings' 36.;   Threeplays later, Young threw a 15-yard scoring pass to Rice for a 7-0 lead with 2minutes, 11 seconds remaining in the first quarter.;   Minnesota answered witha quickie touchdown drive that had many checking the play twice.;   Onthird-and-15 from the 49ers' 46, Wilson threw a quick out to Carter in theflat. He broke right, into what appeared a play-stopping tackle by 49erssafety Johnnie Jackson at the 30.;   But in the takedown, Jackson pulled thePro Bowl receiver down on top of him, and Carter's knees never touched turf.He bolted up, sprinted past Lewis -- who barely touched him, thinking the playwas dead -- and scored. The extra point tied the score at 7-7 with 12:11 leftin the second quarter.;   The 49ers' ensuing drive carried them 69 yards tothe Vikings' 15. There, however, Young's timing pass to Rice, who cut in forthe reception when he spotted free safety Felix Wright leaving the middleopen, was picked off by backup right cornerback Audray McMillian at the goalline and returned to the 2.;   What followed -- a 13-play, 98-yard drivecapped by a 1-yard touchdown run by Walker with 2:25 remaining beforehalftime, cut right into the heart of the 49ers' defense. A 31-yard field goalby Fuad Reveiz increased the lead to 17-7 as the half ended.;   &quot;It was justguys missing opportunities -- we missed tackles,&quot; said linebacker CharlesHaley, who had five tackles and an assist. &quot;We've just got to stay up on guysand drive through them, instead of trying to dive over them.&quot;;   Anotherpromising 49ers drive -- a 54-yarder in the third quarter -- was quashed whenfullback Keith Henderson fumbled on an up-the-middle pile drive at theVikings' 11. The next series was even more disheartening.;   A 49-yard drive,highlighted by Young's 19-yard pass to Rice, his 18-yard completion tosubstitute tight end Wesley Walls and his 5-yard pass to fullback Harry Sydney-- went for naught.;   Mike Cofer's 35-yard field-goal attempt was blocked byVikings backup cornerback Todd Scott, who skirted around Jamie Williams' blockto get to the kick.;   &quot;I went through the technique that I've been taught,&quot;Williams said. &quot;I was doing everything I could to help us win.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NANCY GAY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Minneapolis  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910916  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  998  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 16, 199100260077,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
