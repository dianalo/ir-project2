But U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said Monday she would not holda hearing on the leak allegations made by defense lawyers untilafter Milken's trial, so as not to heighten publicity in theracketeering and fraud case.   Milken's lawyers last week asked Wood to order the government tohalt a ``constant stream'' of press leaks they claimed threatenedthe right to a fair trial for the former head of Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.'s junk bond division.   ``We're very pleased with the court's decision to direct aninvestigation into the alleged leaks,'' Milken attorney MartinFlumenbaum said.   Wood, who is presiding over the case, directed the U.S.attorney's office and the Justice Department's Office ofProfessional Responsibility to examine the alleged leaks bygovernment officials. She also requested private periodic reports onthe probe.   But Wood also said there was no basis in the record for thecontention that the alleged leaks could only have come fromgovernment sources.   Milken was first named in news reports as the government's maintarget shortly after now-jailed speculator Ivan Boesky agreed tocooperate with the government's investigation of widespread WallStreet corruption in late 1986. Boesky provided much of theinformation used to indict Milken.   Newspaper stories since then regularly have contained advancedetails of the government's investigation and indictment plans.Stories have appeared leading up to and containing the indictmentdate as well as the charges.   The motion cited stories published in The Wall Street Journal,The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times.   Milken's lawyers asked Wood to order the government to stopleaking confidential material, hold a hearing to identify thesources of the leaks, impose contempt sanctions on the leakers andmake public a Securities and Exchange Commission memo detailingconfidential testimony in the case that recently was written aboutin the Post.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said the government hadrequested an investigation of the alleged leaks, which defenselawyers have protested regularly, before the motion was filed lastWednesday.   The judge also said the government should instruct the grand juryin the case not to pay attention to any outside reports on the case,which prosecutors said they already had done.   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader BruceNewberg were charged in March in a 98-count fraud and racketeeringindictment that alleges insider trading, securities violations andother crimes. They have pleaded innocent and a March 1990 trial isset.</TEXT></DOC>
