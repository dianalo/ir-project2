The European airline's decision represents a major victory for the St. Louis-based aircraft maker, which has been trying to build a strong base of orders for the new version of the DC-10. It also deals a blow to Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that has been battling McDonnell to stake out the market for a new generation of jumbo jets. Airbus hasn't yet made a final decision whether to build its proposed competitors in that market segment: the A-340 and the A-330.    A Swissair official said the airline chose the McDonnell jet over its chief Airbus rivals largely because of the MD-11's earlier delivery date. He said McDonnell would finish its first Swissair jets in May 1990, while Airbus's earliest proposed delivery date is 1992.    The Swissair official also said the airline was heavily involved in the planning of the MD-11 and that McDonnell had been willing to meet certain specifications that the airline wanted, such as enlarging the plane's rear cargo door.    The airline intends to use the new MD11, a long-distance jet, on several of its nonstop international flights, including Chicago to Zurich and Boston to Zurich. Depending on the seating arrangement, the MD-11 can carry between 276 and 405 passengers as far as 6,600 nautical miles.    Swissair is the fourth airline to sign purchase contracts for the new jets. McDonnell said it has received orders and options from 17 customers for 119 of the planes.    Although potential purchasers include several large foreign carriers, such as Alitalia, British Caledonian Airways and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), McDonnell has yet to land an order from a major U.S. airline -- an accomplishment aircraft analysts believe is critical to the long-term success of the jet.    An Airbus spokesman in Washington said that nine airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa, had made commitments to buy 104 A-330s and A-340s. The two versions seat between 260 and 330 passengers.    &quot;We're sorry to have lost the Swissair sale,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;It's a blow, but not a serious enough blow that we won't launch the aircraft program.&quot; Airbus, which is supported by the governments of France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, estimates the A-330/A340 development program will cost $2.5 billion.    Airbus and McDonnell both face fierce competition from the industry leader, Seattle-based Boeing Co. Boeing makes the wide-body 747 and 767 models used by several domestic carriers. It has 85 orders on hand for its two-engine 767-300-ER and 773 orders for all models of its four-engine 747.    McDonnell shares closed yesterday at $78.50, off 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
