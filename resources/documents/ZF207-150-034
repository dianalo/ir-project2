 The following is a list of systems designed as network serversalong with comments from current users.andM;----------3S/200 and 3S/400 serversandM;3Com Corp.andM;The 3S/200, which replaced 3Com's 3Server3 server line, is an 80186-based,8MHz system that supports 3Com 3+ and 3+Open network software.andP;  It supportsfive to 15 PCs over Ethernet or Token-Ring networks and hybrid networks ofPCs and Apple  Macintoshes.andM;The server comes standard with a 100M-byte hard drive with a Small ComputerSystems Interface (SCSI).andP;  A 150M-byte hard drive is optional.andM;A built-in LocalTalk port is provided for AppleTalk network systems.andP;  The3S/202 version comes with a 150M-byte internal tape-backup unit.andP;  3+ and3+Open software are delivered on tape with the 3S/ 200.andM;The standard version 3S/200 is priced at $8,495; the 3S/202 is priced at$10,495.andP;  Users can upgrade by adding a unit holding an 80386 processor and4M bytes of RAM for an extra $7,995.andM;The 3S/400 is an 80386-based, 16MHz server that runs 3+ or 3+Open networksoftware.andP;  Designed for heavy network loads, it can support a combination ofDOS- and OS/2-based workstations on Ethernet or Token-Ring networks, as wellas Macintosh computers on Apple Computer Inc.andP;  LocalTalk networks.andP;  Hybridnetworks are also supported.andM;The server comes standard with a 150M-byte hard drive.andP;  The 3S/401 versioncomes with a 150M-byte tape-backup unit.andP;  The 3S/402 version comes with a320M-byte hard drive.andM;A standard version costs $12,995; the 3S/401 and 3S/402 versions cost$14,995.andM;3Com Corp. can be reached at 3165 Kifer Road, Santa Clara, Calif.andP;  95052-8145(800) 638-3266.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;At GTE Florida, a division of GTE Corp. in Tampa, 50 to 60 3Com 3Server3 and3S/401 servers are employed on several networks.andM;The 3Com servers ''seem to be plenty fast enough.andP;  I'm surprised they've keptup with the burden we've placed on them,'' said Mike Ferrer,information-center coordinator at GTE Florida.andP;  One network links thecompany's approximately 2,000 users.andP;  ''We've had a little bit of troublewith the tape-backup system, [which] would die in the middle of the backup,''Ferrer said.andP;  The problem can probably be traced to the hard disk or thetape-drive software, he added.andM;The speed of the 3S/401 server and its ability to support 3+Open networksoftware are the system's best features, according to David Wise, chief ofthe information-technology branch at the National Institute of Allergies andInfectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.andM;''The average time between major breakdowns of a system board or a hard disk,for example, is 13 months, for IBM and compatible microcomputers,'' saidWise.andM;''We've experienced much better than that [with 3Com servers], and they'redoing more than workstations do,'' he said.andM;The institute shied away from using PCs as servers because ''you cannotalways be sure PCs will support all applications,'' he said.andP;  ''As networkservers, PCs will freeze up on you.andP;  You find glitches.''andM;DTS and CNS serversandM;Banyan Systems Inc.andM;Banyan's DTS -- Desktop Server -- system is based on a Motorola 68000processor running at 10MHz.andM;It is designed to support small- to medium-sized Banyan Virtual NetworkSystem (VINES) networks with five to 25 users.andM;It supports a variety of LAN hardware configurations, including ARCnet,Ethernet, PC Net and Token-Ring.andM;The DTS server comes standard with 52M bytes, 80M bytes or 146M bytes ofinternal hard-drive storage capacity.andM;Prices range from $8,995 to $12,595, depending on configuration.andM;The Corporate Network Server (CNS) floor-standing system is based on an 80386processor running at 20MHz.andP;  It is built to support from 20 to 100 or moreusers on a VINES network.andP;  It supports ARCnet, Ethernet, ProNET, StarLAN andToken-Ring networks.andM;The CNS server comes standard with 80M bytes, 146M bytes or 320M bytes ofinternal hard-drive storage capacity.andM;Prices range from $23,795 to $33,995, depending on configuration.andM;Banyan Systems Inc. is located at 115 Flanders Road, Westboro, Mass.andP;  01581(508) 898-1000.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''We've had very few hardware problems with our Banyan servers,'' said JohnGood, manager of distributed systems at Turner Corp., a construction companywith headquarters in New York.andM;He noted that the company's Compaq Computer Corp.andP;  Deskpro 386 running Banyansoftware performs as well as the Banyan servers themselves.andM;It was worth paying more for Banyan servers because of features such asbuilt-in battery backup and the ability to expand system memory andhard-drive capacity, Good said.andM;''Our Banyan servers have been workhorses,'' said Norman Ross, a vicepresident at The Chase Manhattan Corp. in New York.andP;  ''They're up just aboutseven days a week, 24 hours a day, and we've almost never had a failure.''andO;Ross was particularly impressed by the systems' battery backup and internaltape drive.andM;MultiServerandM;Network andamp; Communication Technology Inc.andM;MultiServer is a 70-inch high, floor-standing cabinet that holds as many asfour 80386-based 20MHz or 25MHz servers in standard 19-inch racks.andP;  Firstintroduced in June 1988, MultiServer was redesigned and reintroduced inFebruary.andM;The company will install servers and peripherals or sell the unit with emptyracks.andP;  A bare-bones unit would include the cabinet, a control panel, akeyboard and a locking keyboard shelf.andM;The MultiServer will support as many as 11 half-height hard drives in variousconfigurations.andP;  Servers support Novell Inc., 3Com, Banyan and other NetBIOS networks.andM;Two 9-inch, dual-scan monochrome monitors (comprising four screens) includedwith the MultiServer let users view activity on two servers simultaneously.andO;The 30-inch-deep cabinet has a lockable rear door.andM;A bare-bones unit is priced at approximately $2,500; a fully configured unitis priced at approximately $30,000.andM;Network andamp; Communication Technology Inc. is located at 366 Kinderkamack Road,Westwood, N.J.andP;  07675 (201) 666-5630.andM;Because the product was just introduced, no users were available for comment.andM;Triumph TNX andandM;Triumph 4000 serversandM;The Network Connection Inc.andM;The Triumph TNX and Triumph 4000 tower-design systems can be used asworkstations, but are configured primarily as network servers.andM;The 80386-based Triumph TNX offers processor speeds of 16MHz, 20MHz and25MHz.andP;  With an 80386-based processor, the 4000 offers speeds of 16MHz, 20MHzand 25MHz; with an 80286-based processor, the 4000 runs at 12.5MHz.andM;The TNX and 4000 can both be configured with the Triumph ProServerdisk-controller board, which is designed to boost throughput.andM;The TNX is priced between $2,665 and $7,135, depending on configuration.andP;

 .  .andM;''We tried some other 80386-based machines, and this machine with itsmemory-cache board blows away any other,'' said Mark Snidero, seniorconsultant at Ellin andamp; Tucker Chartered, an accounting firm in Baltimore.andP;  Thecompany uses a Triumph 3000 80386-based server that is similar to the TriumphTNX and 4000 servers, but comes as a desktop unit.andM;The firm tried other systems as network servers -- a Compaq Deskpro 386/20and machines by Acer Technologies Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. -- but foundthat the Network Connection's system outperformed them, according to Snidero.andO;There has been no degradation in the performance of the server, even withabout 90 users on the network, he said.andM;LANserver 386andM;Racore Computer Products Inc.andM;The LANserver 386 is an 80386-based, 20MHz floor-standing system that comesin four models varying with hard-drive configuration.andM;The system supports Novell NetWare and Token-Ring hardware or Racore'sproprietary LANpac II network-adapter cards, as well as other networkhardware and software.andM;It comes standard with a 1.2M-byte, 5-1/4-inch or a 1.44M-byte, 3-1/2-inchfloppy drive.andP;
