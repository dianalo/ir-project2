Waves of students hurling firebombs, rocks and bricks foughtriot police around college campuses in Seoul and the provincialcities of Kwangju, Taejon, Chongju, Pusan and Chonju.   Yonhap, the Korean news agency, reported that 22,000 students at58 colleges took part in confrontations and peaceful protests, butdid not give a breakdown. News reports estimated 9,000 studentsparticipated in the unrest that started Monday in Seoul and othercities.   ``Down with the military dictatorship,'' ``Yankee go home'' and``Down with the murder regime,'' the students shouted in therunning clashes.   Hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues, black metalhelmets and gas masks fired volleys of choking tear gas to driveprotesters back. Armored vans with multiple tear gas launchersfired salvos of tear gas bombs as martial arts squads chargedprotesters.   At least two students were injured in fighting at seven collegecampuses in Seoul, but police declined to give any overall figures.Several police officers were hit by firebombs.   The clashes occurred on the eve of the anniversary of the May18, 1980 anti-government uprising in Kwangju, where at least 191people died in a suppression led by the military.   Radical students and dissidents contend the death toll was inthe hundreds and demand that President Roh Tae-woo and other topleaders, who were military commanders at the time, be punished forsuppressing the rebellion.   About 4,000 students held a large rally today at ChonnamUniversity in Kwangju and then fought with riot police when thestudents attempted to march off campus. Student leaders vowed tohold daily protests for a week in Kwangju, 165 miles southwest ofSeoul.   ``Punish culprit Roh Tae-woo,'' the students shouted.   National police were on general alert because of the protests.Security was increased in Seoul with riot police detachmentsguarding key buildings and college campuses.   Protesters chanted anti-American slogans because of their claimsthe United States has supported military rule in South Korea. Anestimated 40,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under adefense pact.   Students burned effigies of Roh and the United States at SeoulNational University in Seoul. Protesters in Kwangju marched with alarge sign showing a broken American flag.   ``Go home Yankees who supported the chief culprits in theKwangju massacre,'' students chanted.   Roh, who took power Feb. 25 after winning election in December,has promised to introduce full democracy and has ended many of theauthoritarian polices of former President Chun Doo-hwan.   But many Koreans are distrustful of the former general. Radicalstudents and dissidents still mount protests against the governmentand demand a full accounting of the Kwangju revolt.   Students and residents seized control of Kwangju in 1980 duringanti-government demonstrations shortly after Chun and the militaryseized power. The military moved in combat units and crushed therevolt, leaving a legacy that traumatized Korean society.   In another development today, the trial of a former policeofficer charged with sexually torturing a female dissident in 1986was interrupted at least 20 times in 90 minutes.   About 150 people repeatedly disrupted the trial in Inchon, aport city west of Seoul, of Moon Kwi-dong. They threw eggs andshouted insults and anti-government slogans. A pair of scissors wasseized from a woman who said she wanted to attack Moon.</TEXT></DOC>
