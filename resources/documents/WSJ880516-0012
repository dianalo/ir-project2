In trade with the U.S. alone, however, Japanese exports fell in April, highlighted by a sharp decline in auto shipments. If the auto-export decline continues, Japan's surplus with the U.S. could continue to narrow.    The Finance Ministry said Friday that the overall April trade surplus declined 10.5% from a year earlier, to $6.75 billion from $7.54 billion. Imports -- almost half of which were manufactured goods -- rose 31.1%, to $15.68 billion, while exports grew a slower 15%, to $22.42 billion.    After seasonal adjustment, the surplus declined 3%, to $6.35 billion in April from $6.55 billion in March. Since last autumn, the seasonally adjusted surplus has widened and narrowed in a slim range, leading some economists to assert that Japanese exporters' success in adjusting to the strong yen may prevent a further substantial narrowing in the surplus.    &quot;The reduction of Japan's trade surplus is not going to move too rapidly,&quot; said Russell Jones, London-based international economist with Hoare Govett Ltd. &quot;We're looking for a decline of only 10% (annually) in the trade and current-account balances, which isn't exactly going to solve the world's economic problems in the next 12 months.&quot; The current account adds trade in services and some unilateral transfers to the merchandise-trade measure.    &quot;The surprising factor,&quot; said Kermit Schoenholtz, vice president with Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., is that Japan's seasonally adjusted trade surplus in dollar terms has held its own on a month-to-month basis &quot;at the same time that the economy has experienced an appreciating currency and strong domestic demand.&quot; The rising yen makes Japanese exports more expensive in terms of other currencies and at the same time reduces the cost of imports to Japan.    In trade with the U.S., Japan's surplus narrowed 19.5% in April, to $4.13 billion from $5.13 billion a year earlier. American exports to Japan rose 39.7%, to $3.21 billion, while Japanese shipments to the U.S. dropped 1.2%, to $7.34 billion. Most significantly, Japanese exports of cars to the U.S. declined 22.9%, to $2.14 billion.    &quot;One month isn't a trend,&quot; said David Gerstenhaber, senior economist with Morgan Stanley International Ltd. in Tokyo, &quot;but if the decline in automobile exports continues, it should be a very positive development from the standpoint of the U.S.&quot;    As in past months, an increasing amount of Japan's exports consisted of capital goods sent to the U.S., the European Community and Southeast Asia. These exports reflect both an industrial retooling prompted by economic growth in those regions and the expansion of Japanese companies' overseas investment in plant and equipment. Exports to the U.S. of general machinery rose 31.8%, to $1.58 billion.    The high level of capital-goods exports, Mr. Gerstenhaber said, may mean that the recovery of Japanese exports may be only cyclical. Once demand for capital goods flattens out, he said, the surplus may decline further.    On the other hand, he added, the strong growth in Japanese imports is probably sustainable because it comes in response to the yen's appreciation. Japanese officials noted that manufactured goods accounted for 49.9% of Japan's April imports, the highest level ever. Among the manufactured goods making inroads into the Japanese market were textiles, nonferrous metal and steel products, especially from such newly industrialized countries in Asia as South Korea and Taiwan.    American exporters showed that they are taking advantage of the Japanese appetite for manufactured foreign goods. For example, shipments of machinery to Japan rose more than 50% in April from the year before, to $923.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
