It was all spending, and nosaving.   &quot;Pretty impulsive&quot; is the phrase Mr. McCormick used todescribe his generation, back in June 1985. The salesman,31-years-old at the time, said he and his friends were buyingbigger houses than they could afford. His family, he said,ran up huge credit-card bills. And they didn't have muchmoney to spare. They counted on income-tax refunds, forinstance, to pay their auto insurance premiums. As forsavings, he said, &quot;It's almost impossible, really.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Today, Mr. McCormick still sells dairy products tosupermarkets and lives in the same house. His wife has anoffice job now, and their income has about doubled since1985, to $60,000 a year. But when he talks about money, BillMcCormick sounds like a new man.   &quot;We're making a concerted effort to put something away --even if it's only a few dollars,&quot; the Iselin, N.J., residentsays. Why? &quot;I'm 37 years old, not 22. It's time to get real.I was always living on the edge. I'm off it now.&quot;   So are many of the other middle-income Americans who gottogether in a New Jersey conference room six years ago at therequest of the Gallup Organization and The Wall StreetJournal. A profound change has occurred in most of them, orso it seems. The shop-till-you-drop ethic, so in evidence in1985, is all but dead. The mood is one of caution, ofconserving cash. There is new emphasis on saving, on puttingaway rainy-day money for an uncertain future.   It may be too early to declare the 1990s The SavingsDecade, and some experts doubt that significant change reallyis afoot. But evidence of a new mood is apparent in recentconversations with baby boomers and young adults, as well aswith financial planners and marketing executives at suchplaces as American Express and Citicorp, which are trying toserve the savings ethic at a profit.   Some economists say that demographic shifts are tiltingthe saving/spending balance more heavily toward saving. Thebulge in the population that began after World War II -- thebaby boomers who are now in their 30s and early 40s -- isentering the highest-income years. So, economists figure,these will be the highest saving years as well. Allcontributing to the saving trend: widespread anxiety aboutthe economy, about depressed real-estate prices andunemployment.   &quot;There has been an extraordinary change in the way welive,&quot; says Fabian Linden, executive director of theConference Board's consumer-research center. &quot;Demographics,society and economic currents of change in the 1990s shouldbe more conducive to savings than {they were} during the1980s.&quot;   Some economists believe that the change in personalfinancial habits is real and will endure. After dipping to apostwar low of 2.9% in 1987, the personal savings rate (as apercentage of disposable income) rose to 4.5% last year. Somepredict the rate will double, to 9%, by the end of thedecade.   Skeptics believe that won't happen. Some say higher taxeswill hinder savings. Others look at history and say thatsavings can rise only if incomes rise, and real incomes inthe U.S. are falling not rising. Some economists argue, ineffect, that saving is un-American.   &quot;Americans like to consume,&quot; says Richard Peterson, chiefeconomist at Continental Bank, in Chicago. &quot;People willcontinue to spend what they earn.&quot;   Maybe so. But in an informal, impressionistic survey, thisnewspaper has found considerable evidence that consumerattitudes are changing. And striking change is very much inevidence among the New Jersey residents who gathered aroundthat conference table six years ago to talk about spendingand saving.   Things were different then. The U.S. economy wasexpanding. And around the table, men and women ranging in agefrom 28 to 68 -- sales reps and homemakers, a key-punchoperator, a systems analyst, a construction worker, anattorney and several others -- all expressed optimism aboutthe future, and confidence in their own financial security.   Abe Ash, the systems analysts, told the story of how heand his wife had lost their jobs in 1976 but still qualifiedfor a home mortgage. So they bought a house, and it tripledin value. Others at the table nodded knowingly.   Panelists talked of trading up to bigger houses, ofexpensive vacations, of proliferating credit cards. Themoderator asked the group at one point what everyone would dowith a $5,000 windfall. Most of the panelists said they wouldblow a lot of it on a vacation.   Barbara Eadie, today an articulate 34-year-old housewife,was part of that 1985 panel, and what she said spoke volumesabout prevailing attitudes toward debt. She and her husband,a computer-programmer, borrowed money for the down payment ontheir house. They borrowed from her parents, too, and weremaking payments to them as well as to the mortgage company,while building equity in their home.   &quot;We didn't have enough saved yet, but we thought it was aninvestment,&quot; said Mrs. Eadie six years ago. She acknowledgedthat it was hard to save, and when her husband got an annualbonus, the bulk of it went to pay bills.   Today, six years later, Mrs. Eadie has a new attitudetoward family finances. She was converted to saving duringthe lean years when her husband gave up his job and, for atime, struck out on his own. &quot;It made us think about havingsomething to fall back on,&quot; she says. Today, funds arededucted automatically from each of her husband's paychecksand deposited in a retirement account.   The Eadie family has some new thoughts about real estate,too. After witnessing a sharp decline in house prices in theNortheast, they have decided to fix up the house they areliving in and have abandoned for the time being plans to buya bigger place.   Mrs. Eadie says the family isn't saving for anything inparticular, &quot;just for some emergency.&quot;   The Eadies have revised their view of credit-card debt,too. In the early 1980s, they were actively using six orseven different cards. They have whittled that down to twonow, and they try to pay off the entire balance every monthrather than make minimum payments and let the debt increase.   &quot;It just felt as if we were sinking all the time,&quot; saysMrs. Eadie. &quot;Having been there before, we aren't going thereagain.&quot;   Even those panelists who in 1985 were casual about workand indifferent to saving now say they are taking a differenttack.   Six years ago, Joseph Steitz sniffed at individualretirement accounts and other long-term saving schemes. The47-year-old construction worker in Verona, N.J., still sayshe'll take a day of fishing over a day of work anytime. Buthe has begun thinking about the future. It started after hisunion and his employer negotiated a mandatory retirement plana few years ago. Each worker must put 18% of his paycheckinto an annuity fund. &quot;I could never do it on my own. Butit's a great thing,&quot; he says. Now he even has a specificsavings goal: &quot;I want to retire as soon as possible,&quot; hesays.   Seven of the 11 original focus-group participants nowexpress a more conservative approach to spending and newdetermination to save. (The other four members didn'tparticipate in the recent discussion.)   Mr. Ash, the systems analyst admits to having been one ofthe &quot;spending pack&quot; before. Today, he says, &quot;I've toned downa bit.&quot; He hasn't taken what he considers a real familyvacation since 1987, and he and his wife, a teacher, areearnestly trying to put as much of her income as possibleaway for retirement.   Several others say that, in contrast to the mid-1980s,they are taking fewer vacations, thinking ahead to retirementand waiting until they can afford to pay cash for what theybuy rather than go into debt.   One who fits that description is Andrew Bruner, a retireewho was a member of the 1985 group. &quot;I'm not a penny pincher,but I just don't do as much anymore,&quot; he says.   Even some young adults in their 20s -- typically bigspenders on furniture, appliances and cars -- are showing apropensity to save these days. Take the unusual case of Kimand George Norris, of Columbus, Ohio, who together earnroughly $50,000 a year. (They were not in the 1985 group.)They seek out $2 movie theaters, avoid expensiverestaurant-meals and budget just $40 per week for gasolineand entertainment. They put 40% of their take-home pay intosavings.   &quot;We save more than the Japanese,&quot; says Mrs. Norris, a26-year-old nurse, whose husband is 25. &quot;Our friends are alsoaggressively working on saving,&quot; she says.   The economic shocks of the past few years are probablybehind much of the new caution. Texas, particularly, wasdevastated in the mid-1980s by the collapse of oil prices. Aneconomy built largely on debt came undone as developers wentbelly up, housing prices plummeted and deeply indebtedhomeowners sometimes abandoned houses they couldn't sell orpay for.   Joan Peurifoy, a personal financial planner in Dallas,sees a sharp change in how her clients regard money. Many aretwo-income couples 35 to 45. Several years ago, when shewarned people that they were overspending, many shrugged offher admonitions. No longer.   Ms. Peurifoy says that, nowadays, many of her clients havethe same response to a financial problem: &quot;How can we fixit?&quot;   Mindful of the new mood, financial institutions are tryingto profit from the new cachet saving seems to have. AmericanExpress has begun encouraging card members to remit a littlemore than they actually owe on their monthly statement.   Under the plan, called Membership Savings, the extra moneygoes into an FDIC-insured savings account paying half apercentage point more than the average rate paid bycommercial banks and thrift institutions. After testing theplan in seven states, American Express is branching out into20 others. The most enthusiastic response has come fromcustomers in their 20s and 30s.   &quot;Financial responsibility is the thing that is going toplay in the 1990s,&quot; says Philip Riese, executive vicepresident and general manager of the consumer card group atAmerican Express.   Citibank is extolling the wonders of savings plans atseminars in 140 branches in and around New York City. And theeducational approach is paying off, according to MatthewKissner, a Citibank managing director in charge of marketingin the New York City area. From January 1990 to January 1991,sales volume of annuities, unit investment trusts and zerocoupon bonds offered through Citibank rose eightfold, whilemutual-fund sales doubled.   High in the glassy Citicorp office tower in Long IslandCity, N.Y., Mr. Kissner pops a cassette in a tape player andsays: &quot;Listen for the educational tone.&quot; A radio spot pitcheszero coupon bonds, explaining both benefits and pitfalls. TheCitibank strategy: Offer lots of different savingsinstruments and take time to explain them.   &quot;It was unheard of for banks to be doing this five yearsago,&quot; says Mr. Kissner. &quot;People are learning you can't counton real-estate values' rising by double digits every year.People are coming out of this recession naturally moreinclined to go back to basics.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
