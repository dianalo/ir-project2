The vote was 89-2, with 48 abstentions on the resolution callingon the United States to comply with the 1986 World Court rulingagainst U.S. funding of anti-government insurgents.   The United States and Israel voted against the resolution, asthey have in the past in the 159-nation General Assembly. Othernations were absent.   Last year the vote was 94-2, with 48 abstentions.   The Netherlands supported Nicaragua Tuesday, changing its votefrom last year's abstention. Other nations which voted for Nicaragualast year were absent or abstaining this year and observers said itwas not a clear-cut gain for either side.   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the deputy permanent U.S.representative, told the assembly that repeated consideration of theitem ``makes no contribution to peace in Central America'' and saidthe item should be stricken from the agenda.   ``The U.S. vote against this resolution is not a vote against theInternational Court of Justice,'' Okun said. ``It is a vote againsta worn-out issue that is translated by the government of Nicaraguainto support for a repressive Sandinista government.''   Okun called the resolution ``counterproductive'' and saidNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has increased itsrepression of democracy during the past year.   The United States argues that the International Court of Justice,the World Court's formal name, lacks jurisdiction in the casebecause all parties to a dispute must accept jurisdiction and theU.S. government has rejected it.   The World Court statute does not require any state to acceptjurisdiction and the court operates on the basis of concensus andacceptance of its authority.   In 1986 the World Court ruled that continued U.S. financing ofNicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, constituted interference inNicaragua's internal affairs. The World Court is the primary U.N.legal body and each U.N. member agrees to abide by its rulings.   The resolution, identical to that submitted last year, says thatall states are obliged under international law not to intervene inthe internal affairs of other states.   The Nicaraguan resolution urgently calls for full and immediatecompliance by the United States with the court ruling and says thatthe General Assembly will consider the issue again next year.</TEXT></DOC>
