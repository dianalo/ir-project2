Here are highlights from some past party conferences, whichunder present rules can be called at any time to consider ``urgentquestions of party policy.''   _First Communist Party Conference held by Russianrevolutionaries at an exile base in Tammerfors, Finland, in 1905,the year of a bloody, unsuccessful uprising that set the stage forthe collapse of the monarchy 12 years later and the BolshevikRevolution that brought the Communists to power.   Seven party conferences were held in Paris, Prague and othercities outside Russia as revolutionaries plotted the overthrow ofCzar Nicholas II.   _1912, the Prague conference votes to create an all-Russianworkers' newspaper, which is today the official party organ, Pravda.   _1924, a party conference held days before the death of Sovietfounder Vladimir Lenin condemned Leon Trotsky and his followers,signaling the rise of Josef Stalin, who was to lead the Sovietstate for most of the next three decades.   _1929, the 16th Party Conference approves the first five-yearplan, the keystone of what has become a cumbersome, centrallymanaged economy.   The 16th conference also ordered a purge of party ranks thatpresaged Stalin's mass political repression of the late 1930s.   _1941, the 18th Party Conference orders party organizations tooversee the management of industry and transport as the nationrushes to prepare for war with Germany.   The party's entanglement in practically all governmental andeconomic affairs, which grew from the resolutions of the 16th and18th conferences, is a key target of Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev's decentralization drive.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 26</NOTE></DOC>
