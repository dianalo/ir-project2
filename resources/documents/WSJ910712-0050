However the talks are being complicated by politicalopposition to the scheme in Rome, as well as Enichem's needto placate the Italian government and unions over job cuts itis planning as part of a long-overdue rationalization.</LP><TEXT>   Enichem is the market leader in polyethylene in Europe,with 18% of the continent's sales. But its plants use avariety of outdated technologies and it needs to modernize toimprove efficiency and cut costs.   &quot;The choice of Union Carbide as a joint venture partnerwould be strategically very important,&quot; says GabrieleCagliari, president of Enichem's parent, state energy groupEnte Nazionale Idrocarburi, known as ENI. &quot;If the talks fail,it won't be a mortal blow to us, but any other solution wouldbe less advantageous.&quot;   Enichem's interest in acquiring Union Carbide's advanced&quot;gas phase&quot; polyethylene process has led to the talks onsetting up two joint ventures in Europe and the U.S.,controlled respectively by Enichem and Union Carbide, toproduce polyethylene. Both companies would contribute plantsto the ventures, which would use Union Carbide technology. Nocash would change hands.   The proposed arrangement has advantages for both groups.Union Carbide wants to gain entry to the European market andsees Enichem as a good way of doing this. Enichem would liketo have more control over its production technology than asimple licensing accord would bring.   While Mr. Cagliari and Enichem's president, Giorgio Porta,are pressing for the Union Carbide deal, they are beingopposed from inside ENI's socialist-dominated board by twonominees of the Christian Democratic party, Alberto Grottiand Antonio Sernia.   The two board members would like to see an alternativeaccord with a European company rather than a U.S. one, andsuggest buying the necessary technology either from BritishPetroleum PLC or Italy's Montedison S.p.A.   &quot;It's not a political debate in the strict sense. But itis a line of reasoning which stems from a lack ofunderstanding of what Union Carbide is proposing and what BPcould provide,&quot; says Mr. Cagliari.   Enichem has had talks in recent years with BP onpolyethylene technology, but they did not result in anyaccords. ENI officials say a licensing agreement with BPcould still be an option if the Union Carbide talks fail, butit would involve a simple acquisition of technology, not anyjoint ventures.   Company officials say Montedison isn't a realistic sourceof technology at present because it has only just announced aprototype production system. As a result, even if Enichemwere interested in acquiring the new process, it would not beimmediately available.   Any prospect of an accord with Montedison is also souredby fresh memories of ENI's epic two-year battle with thegroup over control of the base chemical assets of Enichem'spredecessor Enimont S.p.A., a battle which only ended lastNovember.   For the moment both Enichem and Union Carbide are makingno predictions on the outcome of their talks. Mr. Cagliari iscautiously optimistic, but warns a great deal still has to benegotiated. Initially, the two companies had hoped for adecision by mid-July, but several more weeks of talks looklikely.   While the group is trying to set in motion a majorinternational alliance, its managers are being distracted byhaving to renegotiate a plant closure and job-cutting planwith the Italian government and unions. Analysts say too manyconcessions would compromise Enichem's drive to become morecompetitive.   &quot;If I were Union Carbide, it would make me very wary,&quot;says Mike Hyde of London-based trade publication ChemicalInsight. Mr. Cagliari, while asserting that the domestictalks are not an obstacle to its international ambitions,concedes that &quot;it certainly isn't ideal to have this type ofinterference.&quot;   Although Enichem appears determined to keep most of itsplan intact, unions say around 1,000 of the planned net 4,500job cuts are likely to be avoided under revised proposalspresented by the company this week.</TEXT></DOC>
