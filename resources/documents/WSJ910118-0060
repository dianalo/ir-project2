But it was close. Having just survived a coupattempt, the country shudders at the near assassination ofits president-elect, the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, anevent which would have set the entire country in flames.   As it was, the Jan. 7 attempted coup unleashed a murderousrage against the hated members of the disbanded &quot;TonTonMacoute&quot; security forces. Marauding mobs of young men lynchedan estimated 70 Macoutes, &quot;a la Pere Lebrun&quot; (withgasoline-doused burning tires). Businesses allegedly run byMacoutes were &quot;dechouke&quot; (uprooted) by breaking, looting andmore burning. And a few &quot;executioners&quot; paraded castratedpenises while posing proudly for pictures, unabashedlypublished in the papers.</LP><TEXT>   This unique Haitian flavor of public vengeance is aresponse to an all too common predicament in Latin America:The furious young men were avenging the deprivation ofmanhood by Haiti's 187-year old system of political andeconomic protectionism. This age-old system was onlyperfected under the Duvaliers with enforcement by theofficial Macoute terrorists.   Haiti, the so-called &quot;Pearl of the Antilles,&quot; is theAmerican country with the worst political economy -- whethermeasured by per capita income, life expectancy, literacy,infant mortality, the percentage of children in school orviolent human rights violations. Only a racist wouldattribute the situation solely to Haiti's exotic vodounculture, as Hollywood has. Only ideologues would blame thispoverty on the U.S. occupation that lasted 19 years until1934 and that usually supported the 29 year Duvalierdictatorship that ended almost five years ago. These aresymptoms of a protectionist system from which the only escape(or the only means of exacting justice) is informally orunderground.   The &quot;popular justice,&quot; on display last week and thatFather Aristide promised to end in his campaign, is a &quot;blackmarket&quot; response to a system that has prosecuted only oneMacoute since Jean Claude Duvalier left five years ago.Father Aristide's liberationist branch of the Roman Catholicchurch, like the growing Protestant evangelical church,represents an informal grouping of priests in response to areactionary Roman Catholic hierarchy (once actually appointedby the Duvaliers). And the country's informal economic sectoris fueled by imports smuggled into the country because ofhigh tariffs, quotas and protected monopolists.   After &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier left Haiti, the military juntawas forced by popular pressure to open all the country'sprovincial ports that had been closed for reasons of&quot;national security&quot; -- i.e., the Duvalier regime's protectedinterests. Then-finance minister Leslie Delatour (who leftoffice shortly after the failed 1987 elections), introducedmany liberalizations, such as reducing the number of productscovered by quotas to seven from 113, and ending theprotection of state monopolies in flour and sugar that hadforced consumers to spend two to four times the world price.   Unfortunately, he ignored the army, which sought to takeover the smuggling of goods and transshipment of cocaine tothe U.S. In return, it let him try to reduce corruption andinefficiency in state enterprises and ministries. Instead ofcollecting and sending customs fees to the Central Bank, themilitary pocketed bribes and fought the economic andpolitical democratization process. The subsequent governmentof Leslie Manigat tried to increase government revenue byreducing contraband (not tariffs), which helped to induce thearmy overthrow of his government after only four months inoffice in June 1988.   The Haitian people have no patience for statist economics.Ages of protectionism have led to an enormous informaleconomy, including thousands of &quot;Madam Sara's&quot; who travel tolarge cities to sell cheap food and clothing that arrives onsmall boats. The poorest people in the hemisphere have becomeover the past five years one of the better clothed and fed,thanks to these informal importers and retailers.   Despite the fact that the informal sector suffersdiseconomies of scale, the black market in food (among manyproducts) is a direct challenge to the large &quot;Syrian&quot;families, as they are called, that have managed Haiti'ssupermarkets. They have stocked imports -- procured bytariff-avoiding bribes and large-scale smuggling -- that sellfor higher than U.S. prices.   The tension between these &quot;informal&quot; and &quot;formal&quot; marketsreached the crisis point with the ransacking last week of theLalue Super Market. Owned by Mr. Touffic Jaar's, the storehad an estimated $5 million in damages. Also destroyed wasthe Bazar La Poste store, owned by Mr. Jaar's brother.   One of the overriding objections people had toward theJaar family was their perceived identification with theMacoutes. &quot;The Jaar family are certainly Macoutes,&quot; says oneman interviewed on the street. &quot;They only sell expensiveproducts to the rich that none of us can afford.&quot; The Jaarfamily, of course, denies any Macoute connection, a viewsupported by businessmen interviewed. Several suppliers saidthey are &quot;tough,&quot; &quot;work hard&quot; and &quot;sweat for every penny theyearn.&quot;   But one supplier noted: &quot;It is very possible that theyhave paid some bribes in order to get their imports throughcustoms. In a country with institutionalized corruption, thestore that does not bribe goes out of business.&quot; Unavoidablypart of the Duvalierist system, the burning of Laluerepresents the popular desire for a clean start.   In the meantime, Father Aristide is trying to decide whomto support with his yet undefined economic policy: protected,oligarchic producers representing tens of thousands of jobs(some of whom privately backed Father Aristide's bid, perhapshoping to secure their protection a bit longer), or nearly 7million consumers, off-shore assembly exporters and the manyinformal entrepreneurs? His campaign platform proposedstatist and protectionist solutions preferred by ananti-trade liberalization alliance of Marxists and members ofthe Association of National Producers.   Father Aristide has naively said that he can endcorruption, inefficiency and high prices with good and honestpeople. While it is true that Haiti never has had a leaderwith as honest a reputation as Father Aristide's, it iscompetition, not good intentions, that will lower prices. Theanswer is to lower tariffs and quotas and end private andpublic monopolies -- not to ban contraband and the &quot;MadamSaras,&quot; as his electoral promises would. To implant newvariations of protectionism will merely condemn Haitians tothe continuation of the inequities of privilege that have ledto the decades of murderous vengeance and bloodletting thatFather Aristide is responsibly trying to end.   ---   Mr. Carey, a Fullbright Lecturer at the Central AmericanUniversity in Managua, Nicaragua, in 1989-90, observed theHaitian presidential election for the Organization ofAmerican States.</TEXT></DOC>
