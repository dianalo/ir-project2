(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers union todayextended a sanctioned work stoppage for two more days, meaning about60,000 coal miners east of the Mississippi River will be off theirjobs at least through Friday.   Howard Green, international executive board member from UMWDistrict 17, said the contractually permitted ``memorial period'' isbeing extended to give the Pittston Co. more time to respond to arequest by Virginia's governor that the company and the union resumenegotiations.   ``Unfortunately, in southwest Virginia _ where the primarypurpose of the law appears to be the defense of corporate privilegeat the expense of individual liberty _ the conditions which led tothis protest have, if anything, gotten worse,'' UMW PresidentRichard Trumka said in a news release.   Telephone calls to the office of Pittston spokeswoman SusanCopeland in Lebanon, Va., were not immediately returned.   The memorial period, called last week, originally was intended toend at midnight tonight. Since being called, violence has continuedin the coal fields and state police beefed up patrols.   More than 37,000 UMW members in eight states have been on wildcatstrikes in support of 1,900 miners on striking The Pittston Co. inVirginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.   In Alabama, police said up to six shots were fired today at acoal-loading facility where union miners were harassing non-unionhaulers. A shot fired from 300-to-400 yards away struck a coal truckbut no injuries were reported, officers said.   About 30 state troopers were assigned to the southern WestVirginia coal fields Tuesday after rock-throwing and other violence,primarily in Raleigh, Boone, Mingo and Logan counties.   Lt. Col. G.R. Young said the violence amounted to ``just aboutthe same thing that has been going on during the past few weeks _ afew rocks being thrown, some broken windows, some flattened tires.''   In Boone County, state police responded late Tuesday evening tothe Candamp;T Coal Co. at Nellis where two trucks and a bulldozer were onfire.   Trooper R.L. Richard said no injuries were reported.   In Washington, Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said the HouseSubcommittee on Labor Management Relations will begin aninvestigation into the Pittston strike.   ``Given the length of the strike, the number of workers involved,the protracted involvement of both the state and federal courts andthe potential effect of the strike on the economy, I believe it istime for a congressional investigation of the matter,'' Clay said.   A National Labor Relations Board regional office filed complaintsFriday against both the UMW and Pittston.   Pittson was accused of unfair labor practices such as coercionand bad faith bargaining, a position that, if upheld, would bar thecompany from hiring permanent replacements for the striking unionmembers.   The union, the complaint said, has engaged in illegal picketactivity.   Both the union and Pittston said they will fight the complaints.   UMW President Richard Trumka last week called for a three-day``memorial period'' for union miners east of the Mississippi to stayoff the job through today.   The U.S. Energy Information Agency reported that U.S. coalproduction fell 35 percent in Eastern coal fields during the weekending July 1. Production in West Virginia was down 37 percent fromprestrike levels, from 3 million tons a week before the wildcatstrikes began to 1.9 million tons.   That reduced production has meant few or no shipments to powerplants that burn coal.   Virginia Power Co. spokeswoman Karen Russell said her companynormally maintains stockpiles of enough coal to burn for 35 to 65days, and ``we're now at about the midpoint.''   The utility, which produces 45 percent of its power fromcoal-burning plants, has 1.7 million customers in Virginia and NorthCarolina.   American Electric Power Co., the nation's largest coal customer,has seen its stockpile drop from about 70 days to 65, said spokesmanCarl Crawford.   ``We're not down significantly,'' Crawford said. ``We're gettingsome fuel supply deliveries, but at reduced levels.''   American Electric Power's eight operating divisions serve 7million customers in Ohio, West Virgina, Indiana, Kentucky,Michigan, Virginia and Tennessee.   Trumka said Tuesday he was accepting a request by Virginia Gov.Gerald Baliles that the union and Pittston resume negotiations underthe supervision of a federal mediator, with Trumka and PittstonChairman Paul Douglas heading the negotiating teams.   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom said the company hadno comment on the proposal. ``At the appropriate time, we'll make aresponse,'' Odom said.   Pittston, which has demanded cutbacks that the union fears wouldset an industry-wide precedent, has rejected other requests that thetwo sides resume talks or that Douglas become personally involved inthe negotiations.   In Charleston, U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp indefinitelypostponed strike-related proceedings in his court.   ``I thought it might very well help the situation if all legalproceedings are suspended for the time being,'' Knapp said. ``Idon't want to impede those who are trying to end these strikes.''</TEXT></DOC>
