 In addition, the Xerox 7650 scanner,introduced two years ago, received considerable attention at this year'sType-X--a direct result of a new marketing effort by Xerox on behalf of theproduct.andM;Xerox: 7650 ready for OEMsandM;In the nearly two years since its introduction, the Xerox 7650 scanner hasremained virtually in a class by itself: a mid-range gray-scale scanner witha variable resolution up to 1,200 dpi priced under $10,000.andP;  But because itwas initially marketed only as the Pro-Imager for the Xerox 6085Pro-Illustrator workstation, the scanner is just beginning to receive broadacceptance in the market.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  16, No.andP;  22 for photo and initialsample output.)andM;Although the 7650 has always been available as an OEM product, few companiesseemed to know it was available.andP;  Xerox's OEM division is now stepping up itsefforts to market the scanner, with good results.andP;  At Type-X, threecompanies--Penta, Triple-I and Autologic--showed the 7650 as part of theirscanning systems.andP;  And the OEM division of Xerox took its own booth at theshow to demonstrate the scanner's capabilities with both Macintosh and PCsoftware to prospective OEMs.andP;  A Unix version of the demo software is justabout ready, too.andP;  The company followed its Type-X showing with an appearanceat Comdex/Spring.andM;The purpose of the Xerox demonstration software is to show the underlyingcapabilities of the scanner and its software, which is bundled with themachine.andP;  It also provides a base-level package to which the reseller can addvalue.andP;  A PC add-in card for interfacing through the scanner's parallel portis sold with the PC version.andP;  A SCSI card for the scanner has been developedfor offering with Mac or Unix-based systems.andP;  The actual end-user software,including file format conversions and any additional image manipulationfunctions, is provided by the reseller.andM;The 7650 records 8 bits of gray-scale data per pixel, scanning eithermonochrome or color reflective originals.andP;  In the horizontal direction(parallel to the sensor), the scanner samples the image at 400 dpi butinterpolates the samples to anywhere from 7.5 to 1,200 dpi.andP;  Vertically, thedirection that the scanning head moves, the sample rate is determined by thespeed that the head moves across the image, and it may be set from 7.5 to atrue 1,200 dpi.andM;In addition to its high resolution the 7650 has several advantages owing tothe scanning software Xerox has built into the device, which enables it to:andM;* Crop and scale images within the scanner itself, including support formultiple images on the platen at one time;andM;* Automatically apply programmable thresholding, with 256 levels of gray;andM;* Apply halftone screens (using Xerox's own matrix layouts or using thosedeveloped by the reseller);andM;* Apply programmable image enhancement filters to detect fine lines orsharpen edges and details (unsharp masking);andM;* Automatically calculate the dynamic range of the original from a prescanand reset the endpoints (from white to black) to within that range to obtainmore grays on the final scan;andM;* Reprocess an image saved to disk without rescanning the original.andM;Output from the scanner is asynchronous; it may be stopped and started ateach scan line.andP;  Its speed is up to 200 scan lines per second, whichtranslates to about 13 to 15 seconds for a full-page image at 300 dpi orabout one minute for the same image at 1,200 dpi.andM;All of the above features are provided standard to the OEM or VAR selling theproduct.andP;  The reseller adds image manipulation software and any customfilters, halftone screens or other special features that give its offeringdistinction.andM;Xerox has added to the 7650 a unique feature that is useful for scanning lineart.andP;  A common problem in scanning line art is jagged lines that result fromslight misalignment of the image.andP;  With most scanners, you have two choices:clean up the image in software or try to reposition the original to get astraighter scan.andP;  Both choices may prove time-consuming and frustrating.andM;Xerox has added a rotating surface, made of Xerox proprietary material, tothe scanner's lid.andP;  The material, used in Xerox copiers, adheres well topaper but not to glass.andP;  Using a knob on the lid of the scanner, the user canrotate the image 3.0 degrees to either side--a slight adjustment, but allthat is usually needed to get the image aligned just right.andP;  By zooming in ona preview of the scan, the user can adjust the original until it is right,and then make a final scan that is much closer to reproducing the original.andM;To date, OEMs of the 7650 scanner include Tyrego, Autologic, Dewar and Penta.andO;The retail price is usually about $10,000.andP;  Interested parties should contactSteve Myles of Xerox at (213) 333-8756.andM;PostScript Clones on ScreenandM;We've seen Adobe giving Display PostScript technology demonstrations for morethan a year, but those are always &quot;canned&quot; demos that can't be altered.andP;  AtType-X, we found three firms in various stages of development of PostScriptscreen previews, all of which gave impressive interactive demos.andP;  Lincoln'sPC-based PS Tutor and Pipeline Associates' PS View already are on the market,while Lincoln's PS Tutor/Mac and TeleTypesetting's yet-unnamed product arestill in development.andM;Nor are they alone in sending PostScript to the screen.andP;  Eicon Technology,which makes a PC plug-in PostScript card running EicoinScript, has just begunto ship ES View.andP;  Princeton Graphic, which sells a VGA monochrome monitor andis also a VAR for Raster Image Processing Systems, has software that lets theRIPS PostScript card drive its VGA display.andM;Lincoln's learning toolandM;PS Tutor is an interactive learning tool that lets you edit a PostScript textfile, then see the result on your screen.andP;  As the name implies, it is aimedat people who want to learn the PostScript language.andP;  It is not designed tobe a screen preview of printer files, though it can certainly be used thatway.andP;  Its advantage as a learning tool is turnaround time; rather thanwaiting for the printer to spit out a page (typically two minutes for aLaserWriter), the screen can draw it before your very eyes in a few seconds.andO;Not only do you save time and materials, but you may gain insight by watchingthe process unfold.andM;You can, of course, send the PostScript files you create out to a PostScriptprinter.andP;  In addition, PS tutor lets you print the screen image out todot-matrix printers, LaserJets and the like.andM;The main restriction on using PS Tutor as a previewer is that there isn'tmuch memory in a PC.andP;  The current version of the program is limited to the640K that DOS supports; after you load all the program code set aside 2K fora font cache, you have about 85K available for PostScript's VM, or workingmemory.andP;  Into this space must fit any header files, any down-loaded fonts(which generally consume 35-60K per font) and the PostScript page descriptionitself.andP;  This puts a limit on the complexity of the page you can display, andfor any real page from Ventura or PageMaker it means you can't download anyfonts.andM;The current program is priced at $119.95.andP;  Lincoln says that the next versionof the program will support EMS memory, which will lift the restrictions onfonts and page complexity.andP;  No release date for the upgrade has been set.andM;Mac version.andP;  Lincoln also showed a developmental Macintosh version of theprogram, which is scheduled to be shipped in June.andP;  The base version, pricedat $225, supplies 13 fonts (by Digital Type Systems); for an extra $70, youcan buy the remaining 22 fonts of the standard LaserWriter Plus font set.andM;The Mac product will not suffer from memory shortages quite as much as the PCproduct, though on a one-megabyte Mac there are still some limits.andP;  It willalso take full advantage of the Mac user interface, with all operationscontrolled by pulldown menus and with windows that show the contents of thevarious PostScript stacks and dictionaries.andM;LincPage.andP;  LincPage is Lincoln's PostScript clone RIP.andP;  It is not an end-userproduct, but a set of software modules that a printer manufacturer could linkinto his controller programs.andP;  It is designed to be resolution- anddevice-independent.andP;  The source code is written in the C language and hasbeen ported to Intel 80186- and Motorola 68000-based computers.andP;  Lincoln canhelp its OEMs with other platforms, including multiprocessor implementations.andM;Lincoln said that it has signed an OEM license for an end-user product, butit cannot yet disclose any details about the license.andP;  Look for anannouncement toward the end of the summer.andM;Pipeline's PS ViewandM;PS View runs on more platforms than any competitive product we've seen:Macintosh, PC, the Apollo Domain workstations, and generic Unix workstationsrunning X Window (version 10.4; the X-11 version is not ready yet).andP;  The baseproduct includes 13 Alphatype fonts (Alphatype was one of the first customersfor Pipeline's PostScript interpreter) and more are available from Alphatype,but PS View can also run URW Nimbus-Q fonts or Bitstream Fontware.andP;  Theproduct is Pipeline's screen-display version of PS Clone.andM;The Mac, PC and X Window versions of PS View cost $395; the Apollo version,which uses Apollo native graphics mode for screen rendering, costs $495.andP;  Tothis, you must add a media charge for Unix tape formats of $20-40.andP;  Thisprice also does not get you any printer drivers; you can add a 300-dpi laserprinter driver for $200 or a dot-matrix driver for $100.andP;  A color-printerdriver will be available in a few weeks.andM;PS Clone.andP;  This is Pipeline's OEM product, comprising some 30,000 lines of Csource code.andP;  Pipeline says that it has been ported to 68000, 80386, NS32000,AMD 29000 and SPARC processors, and there are versions that run on theMacintosh, MicroVax, Unix, MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems.andP;  It is rated upto 5,000-dpi resolution.andM;In addition to working with Alphatype vector fonts, Bitstream Fontware, URW'sNimbus-Q, and PostScript Type Three fonts, Pipeline says that it will be opento working with other font vendors' formats (e.g., Intellifont).andO;Essentially, the font rendering engine in PS Clone is a separate module fromthe rest of the interpreter; a font technology from another vendor could be&quot;dropped in&quot; without affecting the design of the other modules.andM;TTS turns to the screenandM;With its PostScript-to-typesetter code converter programs largely completed,TeleTypesetting has turned its energies to showing PostScript on the screen.andO;Its program is only part way through the development process, and it hasn'tbeen &quot;productized&quot; with a name and a price tag yet.andP;  TTS is simultaneouslyaddressing the PC and Macintosh platforms; the PC version will run as astandalone application, while the Mac version will be a Chooser devicedriver.andM;The program will use Compugraphic fonts and will drive a number of outputdevices: Mirus slidemaker, HP LaserJet and ColorPro, and Versatec plotters.andO;The finished product will support color output, although at the moment itrenders colors as gray values.andM;PostScript for Old TypesettersandM;A year ago, there appeared a great flowering of programs that convert theoutput of desktop publishing programs into something that a non-PostScripttypesetter can use.andP;  Some of them, like Edco's, have installable devicedrivers for specific desktop publishing programs; Edco offers PubSet forVentura Publisher and PageSet for MAcintosh products (it trnslates Quick-Drawinto typesetter codes).andP;  TeleTypesetting translates Quick-Draw with itsMac-based Microsetter II program and PostScript files with the PC-basedMicrosetter-PS.andM;Although these vendors have refined their software over the past year, thesubject is no longer new.andP;  (Several vendors told us that sales have alreadystarted to decline; they know that transition products like these have abrief life.)andP;  Progress is mostly a matter of supporting a few moretypesetters and cleaning up a few more bugs.andP;  For instance, Edco and CSP haveadded Densy (to support CRTronics) to the list of typesetter languages theydrive.andM;CSP focuses on screen fontsandM;Computer Solutions for Publishing showed an interesting program for rapidlygenerating Macintosh screen fonts that match your typesetter fonts.andP;  To bemore precise, the software takes the width table for one of your typesetterfonts and an existing Mac screen font that you select, then generates a newMac screen font that has the typesetter widths and the bit maps from the oldscreen font.andP;  The result may or may not look good on the screen--if you don'tlike it, you can use a screen font editor like Fontastic to improvematters--but it is guaranteed to print correctly on your typesetter.andM;If your typesetter supports the operation, the program can automatically readthe width tables out of the typesetter.andP;  Otherwise, CSP has a library ofwidth tables that it has already generated for its customers.andP;  If worst comesto worst, you'll have to type the widths from data sheets provided by thetypesetter vendor.andM;The program is part of the Link package, rather than a separate product.andP;  Theentire package--both PC and Mac versions, plus the width utility--is now$1,990; last year CSP was selling the several components separately.andM;Parnau GraphicsandM;Parnau Graphics sells V-Prep, a program for taking output files from VenturaPublisher and typesetting them on a Mergenthaler CRTronic.andP;  This abilitywould be useful for a CRTronic user who wanted to take in work generated byVentura users, or for one who wanted to use Ventura in his or her ownoperation.andM;The principal function of V-Prep is converting PostScript files into CRTronicones.andP;  V-Prep runs in an IBM-compatible PC (it can be the same one that runsVentura, but it doesn't have ot be).andP;  It takes PostScript code and throwsaway all but text and rules.andP;  It converts PostScript positioning commands tocommands that have the same effect on the CRTronic.andP;  (Multi-column work isset straight across the page, without using reverse leading.)andP;  The resultingfile can be transferred to the CRTronic via a telecommunications interface(if one is available) or via disk conversion programs such as TronicAlternative or TComplus.andM;V-Prep contains a font-builder utility that lets you set up CRTronic fontwidths in Ventura.andP;  If you type in width values as they are supplied byMergenthaler (in 54ths of an em), V-Prep converts them to the format Venturaneeds.andP;  There is also a way to enter kerning data.andP;  The width files that arecreated by this process can be easily duplicated and shared with customers.andM;There is also a proofing module, which allows jobs to be proofed on aLaserWriter using only Helvetica and Times (if desired) as proxies for theactual faces that will be set.andP;  Using it, a customer can proof a job forwhich he or she doesn't have LaserWriter fonts.andM;V-Prep costs $795 (though there was a $495 &quot;show special&quot; price at Type-X),and a $20 demo disk is also available.andM;Parnau Graphics, Inc., P.O. Box 244, 2857 South 160th Street, New Berlin,Wisconsin 53151; phone (414) 784-7252.andM;Other PostScript NewsandM;Compumation's BureauMasterandM;Pity the poor PostScript service bureau operator who takes in jobs via modem.andO;The customers send any old file and expect him to print it flawlessly andcheaply.andP;  But that isn't so simple in today's computing environment.andP;  He hasto have the right prep file (PostScript header) loaded in the typesetter,capture the billing information, recover from PostScript errors and keep themodem available for customers at all hours.andM;BureauMaster to the rescue.andP;  This is a shop management program for theservice bureau.andP;  It does three main tasks:andM;* Bulletin board.andP;  The program can operate up to seven modems simultaneously,capturing files sent in by customers and saving them on disk.andP;  At thebeginning of each dialup session, the program gathers necessary informationabout the customer and the job to be run.andP;  It also offers password securitycontrol.andP;  The program uses the widely available Xmodem error-checkingprotocol and is thus compatible with most popular communication packages.andM;* Queue manager.andP;  The files to be typeset are sorted into queues based on thetype of film to be used, the prep file to be preloaded, rush requests and soon.andP;  The bureau operator controls which queues are sent to the printer andwhen.andP;  The software records how long each job takes and captures any errormessages from the RIP.andP;  Jobs can be aborted, requeued, purged and archived.andM;* Accounting.andP;  A job database keeps track of each customer's work and canprint invoices and management reports.andP;  It also provides information aboutthe routing and delivery instructions for work going through the shop.andM;All those different operations can be going on simultaneously in one PC.andO;That's because instead of running under MS-DOS (a single-task operatingsystem), it runs under Double-DOS, a DOS-compatible multitasking operatingsystem.andM;The price for Compumation's software is $3,000.andP;  This includes access totelephone advice and a bulletin board from which operators can upload thelatest PostScript filter programs and utilities.andM;ECRMandM;ECRM announced its PostScript approach at Type-X, and it is representative ofwhat may be a new trend in the Postscript output world.andM;If, as an ECRM customer, you want to be able to output PostScript pages, ECRMwill be glad to help you obtain your PostScript RIP from a third-partysource, but ECRM will not sell PostScript itself.andM;At Type-X, ECRM shared booth space with Hyphen, whose PostScript RIP softwarewas running in a Macintosh II.andP;  This was connected to the ECRM SCSI buffer.andO;The Hyphen software constructed the page on the Mac, then transferred the bitmap to the ECRM buffer, from which it was output to film.andP;  The Hypehn productrequires a Macintosh II with 8 MB of memory.andP;  The RIP software andaccelerator board (without the Mac) cost $17,000.andM;ECRM decided to take the third-party approach because, in the words of BillGivens, &quot;RIPs are now almost to the shrink-wrap stage,&quot; and it doesn't makesense to build a proprietary one.andP;  The company is also reluctant to getinvolved in the support and compatibility issues of a software-based product.andO;It prefers to stick with what it has been successful at: producing precisionimaging hardware.andM;Also making its debut at Type-X was a prototype &quot;defocusing&quot; module.andP;  This isused for scanning prescreened material that needs to be output at a differentscreen ruling.andP;  Without the defocusing step, serious moire' patterns canresult.andM;Media ConversionandM;ALTX: a 'new beginning'andM;The last couple of years have been transitional ones for ALTX, since itacquired the Altertext company and product line.andP;  We had grown used to seeingAltertext, Shaffstall and U.S.andP;  Lynx battling tooth and nail for their sharesof the media-conversion market.andP;  But after the acquisition, we didn't see thecompany until IPEX last September, when it exhibited a new version of thesystem.andP;  It runs on a PC under MS-DOS, rather than under CP/M.andP;  The userinterface has been streamlined to make the system easier to use--menus andprompts take the user all the way through the process.andP;  Translation programsnow convert data from one format to another in one step, without requiringthe operator to convert to the internal A-code first.andP;  (The system still usesA-code as an intermediate step, but this is transparent to the user.)andM;At Type-X, ALTX demonstrated the same system with some new conversionsoftware, but, probably more important, the company said it was using theshow to launch a &quot;new beginning.&quot;andP;  It has hired new programmers and willannounce a new software release in June.andP;  It now converts Microsoft Wordfiles on a Macintosh disk and has enhanced the user interface enough to bemore appealing to desktop users.andM;&quot;We are over the growing pains associated with the new ownership,&quot; thecompany said.andP;  The next step will be to bring public awarness back to whereit was three or four years ago.andP;  We'll see what happens.andM;The current product line includes the Altertext Document Conversion System I,consisting of a '286 PC with a 30-MB hard disk and five floppy drives: one8&quot;, two 5-1/4&quot;, one 3-1/2&quot; and one Mac.andP;  Also included in System I are allprograms for reading disk formats and all programs for writing disk formats.andO;The price is $15,000.andM;System II is identifical to System I, with one exception: it includes all&quot;read&quot; programs, but only one program to write to a target disk.andP;  The priceis $9,500.andP;  So if all you need is to write one disk format, the System IIsaves a lot of money.andP;  Service bureaus needing to support a variety of targetformats would go for the System I.andM;Avalanche goes commercialandM;We have written about Avalanche's Visual Recognition System several times(most recently two issues ago in our coverage of CALS-related exhibits at theSeminar).andP;  What the company has done is taken the base technology of theengine and put it into a PC product that is being marketed throughvalue-added resellers across the country.andP;  Avalanche will continue to work asan OEM with suppliers interested in incorporating its technology into theirown private-label products.andP;  To date, Shaffstall, Compugraphic and Contexthave made such agreements.andM;F  FastTag.andP;  FastTag is the new name for what Avalanche used to call theIntelligent Markup System, or Imsys, its flagship product.andP;  FastTag runs onany AT-compatible and the Sun-3 and 386i workstations.andM;FastTag reads an output file of WordPerfect or Microsoft Word or the printerfile (in Epson, Diablo or IBM Proprinter formats) of another word processorand, based on the indent, line spacing, left and right margin offsets andjustification mode, converts the file to a tagged file for your targetsystem, which may be Ventura, XICS, Quadex, IBM GML, Xyvision, Penta, Scribe,Datalogics, Flexicon, TEX and several Unix  formatters.andM;Using the MuSpec utility within the software, the user defines what markup toapply to the text file as a substitute for object positioning.andP;  For example,centered text might be coded as a first-level head; three lines of spacefollowed by bold text might be a second-level head; and so forth.andP;  For eachelement, indent and spacing values may be set or ignored.andM;FastTag is available through VARs, such as Inforizon and HerbertCommunications, both of which operate in the Washington, DC, area.andP;  The priceis $2,450 for the PC version, and $4,750 for the Sun versions.andP;  ContactAvalanche to find the nearest VAR.andM;Shaffstall: finding the Missing LinkandM;Shaffstall had several new developments to unveil.andP;  Like US Lynx, itrecognizes the growing need for file conversion software, especially on Unixnetworks, and is therefore moving to decouple its software from the 6000conversion hardware.andP;  It also has developed a facility for convertingPostScript output files into the format of various typesetting systems.andP;  Onthe hardware side, Shaffstall introduced a Micro Channel add-in card thatallows the 6000 to be configured with IBM PS/2s.andP;  It also demonstrated itsSGML Translator and Computer Solutions' Link, which we have covered before.andM;The Missing Link.andP;  To underscore the decoupling of its file conversionsoftware from the 6000 media conversion system, Shaffstall has introduced itssoftware-only products as The Missing Link.andP;  Available now for MS-DOS, theMissing Link includes Shaffstall's text processing language and SDS metafileformat for converting from one format to another.andM;Porting to Unix.andP;  Shaffstall is porting its underlying file conversionsoftware to other platforms.andP;  The first one, not surprisingly, is the Sun-3workstation; this software was introduced and demonstrated at Type-X.andP;  Itsinterface, unfortunately, is command-driven, with all conversions programmedin Shaffstall's language.andP;  The advantages to the Unix version are backgroundprocessing and piping: the file may be routed to a workstation, run throughthe filter and brought back out again without operator intervention.andP;  Thedown side to Shaffstall's initial implementation is that the user will haveto rely on Shaffstall for the filters, which cost extra.andP;  Not shown but nexton the platform list: the Vax running under VMS.andM;The price for versions of the Missing Link will vary according to workstationand capability, from $1,000 for a low-end Sun-3 with one input and one outputfilter, to $9,500 for a large Vax.andP;  The SGML Translator (not yet available inUnix) will be priced at $4,500 with one input filter.andP;  Additional filters are$500 to $750 apiece.andM;PostScript translation.andP;  Shaffstall has had requests from its customers todevelop a facility for converting PostScript output files into editable filesfor typesetting systems.andP;  Some PostScript service bureaus, evidently, want tooffer customers more capability than what their desktop publishing softwarecan provide, while still accepting their disks.andP;  At this time, the softwarereads PC PageMaker output files and converts them to Shaffstall's nativeformat, from which they may be converted to the target format.andP;  thetranslator has so far been tested with Bedford as the target format inresponse to a customer request.andP;  The remaining key source requirements (MacPageMaker, Quark Xpress, Ventura Publisher) are scheduled to be completedwithin the next six months.andM;The PostScript interpreter is a $2,995 option for a 6000 system, but becauseit is all software Shaftstall plans eventually to offer it as a softwareproduct.andM;T-Bug.andP;  A final note for current Shaffstall customers: Shaffstall is nowselling T-Bug, a program for debugging translations on the System 6000.andO;Running under MS-DOS, T-Bug lets you watch the translation process as ithappens and interrupt it to look more closely at what is happening.andP;  (Youmust start the translation process over again, though, if you want to correcterrors in your conversion setup.)andP;  The utility is offered at $695, or $395 tocurrent users with maintenance contracts.andM;US Lynx on Unix networksandM;US Lynx already has its Unix version of Copy Marketing in the field at Xeroxas part of Xerox's package for the 50-S contract.andP;  However, this was thefirst public showing of the Unix version.andP;  In addition, US Lynx showed CopyMarking running under Desqview, which runs several applicationssimultaneously under MS-DOS.andP;  US Lynx demonstrated Copy Marking running inone window while a communication program was running in another window.andP;  Thisconfiguration would enable a customer to keep a phone line open to captureincoming files while still running other applications at the same time.andM;VPix Copy Marking.andP;  All of the Copy Marking products are now availablerunning under Interactive System's VPix, which is Unix System V.2 with a DOSshell as one of the Unix tasks.andP;  The Unix configuration allows the CopyMarking system to be placed on a Unix network, where it can receive files fortranslation from anywhere on the net.andP;  Using Unix scripts and Copy Marking'sability to chain tables together, files can be routed to the workstation, runthrough the translation and piped back out again without operatorintervention.andP;  Unix versions of Copy Marking cost $1,200 more than thestandard MS-DOS versions.andM;In disk conversion, US Lynx now offers a version of the 4000 that supportsthe 3&quot; Amstrad Computer disks that are sold by Sears.andM;Other Output DevicesandM;APT shows Chameleon 3.0andM;Applied Publishing Technologies had, apart from its own booth, a nook inanother part of the hall that contained a proof printer mysteriouslyproducing pages with no visible means of support.andP;  Visitors intrigued by thisapparition were steered to the APT booth, where the full Chameleon proofingsystem was on display.andM;A special system just for remote proofing, Chameleon Remote, has beenavailable for a few months.andP;  Version 3.0 of the Cora proofing system isslightly more recent, and version 3.0 of ICL (Autologic) proofing is justgoing into general release.andP;  The latter's only present limitation is fontavailable; APT is creating fonts for use with the ICL proofing system.andM;Chameleon can now take simultaneous output from two front ends, keeping eachoutput stream contiguous.andP;  When multiple jobs have been output for proofing,the user can transfer or copy jobs between proof output queues, andpriorities may be assigned to determine the order in which proof jobs areprinted.andM;An intelligent font retrieval process maximizes system speed.andP;  All fonts arestored in one file and indexed.andP;  If a bullet is needed from a pi font, forinstance, Chameleon retrieves just that bullet, rather than spending time todownload the whole font.andP;  Another enhancement is provided by an optional&quot;stretch/squeeze emulation&quot; ($1,000); for fonts not available on the printer,this option substitutes another font but uses the widths of the desired font,producing proper character placement and line breaks.andM;APT sells the Chameleon Master System Software for $7,500.andP;  For the Remotesystem, a Remote Host Module costs $3,995.andM;Like several other exhibitors, APT demonstrated a preproduction model of theQMS--PS 2200 11&quot; X 17&quot; 300-dpi laser printer based on an Adobe Atlas RIP; itsprice for this printer (with 4 MB of memory) is $14,995.andM;Atech scales on matrix printersandM;PostScript and desktop publishing are all very well and good, but what if youcan't afford a PostScript printer?andP;  Atech offers one solution: PublishersPowerpak, a printer driver for a wide range of dot-matrix and ink-jetprinters.andP;  The Powerpak software has font scaling built in, covering a rangeof sizes from 6 points to 1000 points.andP;  It drives the printer in graphicsmode at the highest resolution the printer is capable of.andM;The program comes with three outline fonts: Dixon (sans serif), Marin (serif)and Cobb (typewriter).andP;  You can also with any combination of bold, italic orhollow.andP;  You can also select one of five set widths: two condensed settings,two expanded and normal.andP;  The outline fonts take up a mere 18K of disk space.andM;Most DOS word processors have limited abilities to use scalable fonts, but afew can put the scaling to good use--Microsoft World and WordPerfect 5.0,among others.andP;  Desktop publishing programs have the further requirement ofinstalling screen fonts.andP;  For these, a Font Manager module generates andinstalls the screen fonts you intend to use.andM;The samples we saw looked respectable above 12 points, though no one would befooled into mistaking them for laser printer output.andP;  Below 12 points, wethink you would be better off using the dot-matrix printer's native fonts,unless you are using the output only for proofing.andM;Prices vary depending on which version of the software you are getting.andP;  Thedriver for PFS First Publisher costs $79.95.andP;  The version for MS Word andWordPerfect is priced at $139.95, while the Ventura Publisher version is$199.95.andP;  The program runs on any PC with 512K of memory and a hard disk.andM;Atech Software, 5926 LaPlace Court, Suite 245, Carlsbad, CA 92008;

 It was using aPC to create letters to be output on a LaserJet.andP;  Davis has developed asimple program for determining line breaks (ragged mode, no hyphenation).andO;Fonts are downloaded by selecting items from a menu.andM;Davis hopes to sell the program to secretaries writing letters usingmail-merge facilities, generating labels, etc.andP;  Pricing and sales strategieshaven't been determined, except that sales likely will be through advertisingand telemarketing.andP;  Obviously some of the candidates will be the Varityperusers the company has already dealt with.andM;Of greater interest to some markets will be a program Davis is working on forfiling data electronically with the Securities Exchange Commission--a processcommonly known as EDGAR.andP;  Davis says it will be ready when the bell rings tostart the EDGAR movement, but until that happens, everyone is waiting.andP;  TheDavis program wasn't demonstrated at Type-X.andM;Genicom in productionandM;The Ace-language printer that was introduced last fall at the Seybold DesktopConference is now in production.andP;  A 300-dpi printer with an Ace RIP, 1 MB ofmemory and 13  LaserWriter-compatible fonts is priced at $4,295.andP;  Genicom ispitching the printer as a fast alternative to PostScript, and it has prepareddriver software for Windows (PageMaker), GEM (Vetntura Publisher), AutoCadand Microsoft Word.andP;  The WordPerfect PC word processing program comes withits own Ace driver.andM;The base model 6140 can be enhanced with more memory; the 3-MB model 6142costs $4995.andP;  You can retrofit either printer with 22 more fonts (to make upthe LaserWriter Plus set of 35 fonts) by plugging in a $699 font board.andM;Lt fall, we viewed the printer as a low-cost, low-resolution version of theChelgraph IBX typesetter, assuming that since both used the Ace language theywould be fully compatible.andP;  Genicom, however, says that that isn't so.andP;  Thereare Ace commands in the 6100 series that aren't implemented in the IBX.andO;Thus, you can't simply print an Ace file to disk and send the disk to an IBXservice bureau.andP;  The only way to assure correct results is to carry theentire application program to the service bureau and print the file directlyinto the typesetter.andM;In our view, Genicom had an opportunity and has blown it.andM;Genicom's version of PostScript, Geniscript, is due out in the fourth quarterof 1989.andP;  We hope that will not be too late.andM;Itex: foil transfersandM;Itex (no relation to Itek or Itek Graphix) is not in the publishing systemsmainstream, but it offers a clever product for a niche market.andP;  The productconsists of a PC, a scanner, and a laser print equipped with a foil transferunit.andP;  The PC runs basic composition software licensed from MediaCybernetics.andP;  It supports about 40 faces from Hewlett-Packard and Bit-stream.andM;Using the Itex unit, you can create business cards, awards, raffle tickets,birth notices--almost any printed piece that is likely to be required insmall numbers.andP;  The piece can be composed on the PC (including, perhaps, lineart scanned on the scanner) and output at 300 dpi on the laser printer.andP;  Thefoil-transfer unit converts the black printer dots into areas of color.andP;  Toadd a second color, you repeat the process with a different colored roll offoil in the foil-transfer unit.andP;  The new color will adhere wherever there isa new black image, but it won't adhere to the previous colored areas.andM;The cost per page for consumables is just under 20 for one-color output andunder 40 for two-color.andP;  The Itex unit, including a guillotine cutter, costs$41,840.andM;We can see that there is an opportunity for this kind of small-scalepublish-on-demand system.andP;  The output quality is not ideal, but it is finefor many products.andP;  Itex says that it has 112 sites so far, most of them indime stores, photofinishing shops, and other small stores.andP;  None have beeninstalled in conventional typesetting operations.andM;Locker adds VT600andM;Although known mostly for sales of used machines, Locker TypesettingEquipment is moving in a new direction.andP;  It is now a reseller of VarityperVT600 and 600W PostScript printers.andP;  It will continue to use its previoussales strategy--telemarketing, advertising and show appearances--but will addreferral agents around the country to put potential customers in contact withLocker's staff.andP;  This is a program Varityper has had in the past and is nowturning over to Locker.andM;Locker also has begun selling packages including hard disks with desktoppublishing software such as Quark Xpress, Aldus PageMaker, etc.andM;There have been no changes in the StarText software that runs on a Macintoshand drives conventional Varityper typesetters.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
