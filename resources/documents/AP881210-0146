Doug Elmets, the Energy Department spokesman, declined comment onthe story, but acknowledged that a classified report was being sentto President Reagan to be taken to Capitol Hill on Thursday.   The Post, quoting administration sources, said the EnergyDepartment recommends building four small reactors at the IdahoNational Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls instead of thesingle unit the department proposed earlier this year. Thedepartment also proposes a new, large reactor at the Savannah RiverPlant in South Carolina.   In the report, according to the paper, the department alsoproposes closing a uranium foundry, the Feed Materials ProductionCenter, near Fernald, Ohio, and the Rocky Flats plutonium-processingplant near Denver. It also recommends moving plutonium-relatedactivities out of the Pinellas Plant near Largo, Fla., and out ofthe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory east of San Franciscobecause, one of the newspaper's sources said, ``there are too manypeople there.''   The classified report, described by the Post as a blueprint forthe future of the nuclear-weapons complex, is scheduled to beforwarded to the Senate and House Armed Services committees nextweek, according to the paper. It said the report may be held up forseveral weeks because of a dispute between the Energy Department andthe Office of Management and Budget over high costs.</TEXT></DOC>
