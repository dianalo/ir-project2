DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court struck down Tuesday aSecurities and Exchange Commission attempt to prevent corporationsfrom creating unequal voting rights among their stockholders.   The three-judge appeals panel unanimously ruled in favor of anassociation of top corporations that had contended the SEC wasexceeding its authority by imposing a so-called ``one share, onevote'' rule.   The rule in question, SEC Rule 19c-4, was adopted in July 1988.It prohibited publicly traded corporations from weakening thevoting power of existing stock holders by issuing new classes ofstock with superior or ``supervoting'' rights.   The court upheld the arguments of The Business Roundtable, whichclaimed the rule interfered with corporate governance _ authoritytraditionally left to the states.   The SEC had claimed it had a right to impose the one share, onevote rule as part of its mission under the 1934 law that createdthe commission to protect investors in publicly traded companies.   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District ofColumbia disagreed. In an unusually sharp rebuke, the courtchastened the SEC for trying to put its own ``spin on a statutoryfragment.''   SEC officials had no immediate comment on the ruling, sayingthey hadn't yet read it.   ``It's a very important decision that limits the SEC's attemptto regulate corporate governance,'' said Washington attorney RobertD. Rosenbaum, who represented The Business Roundtable in oralarguments last November before the appeals court.   The Business Roundtable is an association of 200 corporations,including such corporate giants as American Express Co., XeroxCorp., Citicorp and General Mills.</TEXT></DOC>
