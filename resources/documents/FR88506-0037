The Secretaryof the Interior (Secretary) may open refuge areas to hunting and/or fishingupon a determination that such uses are compatible with the major purpose(s)for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available fordevelopment, operation, and maintenance of a hunting or fishing program.The action must also be in accordance with provisions of all laws applicableto the areas, must be consistent with the principles of sound wildlifemanagement, and must otherwise be in the public interest. This rulemakingproposes to open five refuges to hunting and two to sport fishing. Someof the proposed hunting and fishing programs require refuge-specific huntingor fishing regulations. These regulations will be included in a separaterulemaking document on refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations.Department of the Interior policy is, whenever practicable, to afford thepublic an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. It is,therefore, the purpose of this proposed rulemaking to seek public inputregarding the opening of the refuges cited below to migratory game bird,upland game or big game hunting, and/or sport fishing. Accordingly, interestedpersons may submit written comments concerning this proposal to the AssistantDirector_Refuges and Wildlife (address above) by the end of the commentperiod. All relevant comments will be considered by the Department priorto issuance of a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities</ITAG>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as amended(NWRSAA) (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C.460K) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges.Specifically section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretaryto permit the use of any area within the Refuge System for any purpose,including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreation and accommodations,and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the majorpurposes for which each refuge was established. The Service administersthe Refuge System on behalf of the Secretary.The Refuge Recreation act gives the Secretary additional authority to administerrefuge areas within the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriateincidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable andnot inconsistent with the primary purposes for which the refuges were established.In addition, prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing under thisact, the Secretary is required to determine that funds are available forthe development, operation, and maintenance of these permitted forms ofrecreation.In accordance with the NWRSAA and the Refuge Recreation Act, the Secretaryhas determined that the proposed openings for hunting and fishing wouldbe compatible and consistent with the primary purposes for which each ofthe refuges listed below was established, and that funds are availableto administer these programs. The hunting and fishing programs will bewithin State and Federal (migratory game bird) regulatory frameworks. Adiscussion of the compatibility of the hunting and fishing programs withthe purpose(s) for which each refuge was established and the availabilityof funding for each program follows: Cache River NWR was established in June 1987, by authority of the MigratoryBird Conservation Act to protect and preserve a portion of internationallysignificant waterfowl habitat. The bottomland hardwood forest containedwithin the refuge serves as important wintering habitat for mallards andexcellent year-round habitat for a variety of other wildlife species. Itis proposed to open the refuge to migratory game bird (waterfowl, dove,woodcock, snipe), upland game (squirrel, rabbit, quail, raccoon) and biggame (deer) hunting, as well as sport fishing. Present numbers of includedwildlife species are large enough to support a hunting and fishing programand provide for the beneficial use of a renewable resource. The proposedactivities would not interfere with the continued protection and preservationof the bottomland hardwood forest and its ability to provide for migratorywaterfowl throughout the year. Refuge-specific regulations would reduceany time and space conflicts between these activities and other permitteduses. By ensuring that the populations of key wildlife species, particularlydeer, are maintained within the capacity of the available habitat to supportthem, the important hardwood tree species typical of the bottomland forestwill continue to be preserved and food will be available for all speciesof wildlife. A section 7 evaluation under the Endangered Species Act concludesthat the proposed programs ``will not affect'' any listed endangered orthreatened species. Opening the refuge to hunting and sport fishing wouldcontribute to the attainment of refuge objectives in terms of wildlife_orientedrecreation, would be compatible with the purpose for which the refuge wasestablished and thus be in compliance with the NWRSAA. The annual costto administer the programs is estimated at $13,000. Within the currentannual refuge complex budget of $357,000 the necessary funds are availableto administer these programs. Therefore, opening the Cache River NWR tohunting and sport fishing would be in compliance with the Refuge RecreationAct. Edwin B. Forsythe NWR was created in 1984 by combining the former Brigantine(established in 1939 by authority of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act)and Barnegat (established in 1967, same authority) NWRs and renaming therefuge after the late New Jersey congressman. The purpose of the refugeis to provide habitat for migratory birds, particularly black ducks andAtlantic brant. It is proposed to open the refuge to big game (deer) hunting.The purpose of the hunt is to maintain the refuge deer herd within thecarrying capacity of the habitat and provide for the use of a renewablenatural resource. The deer herd is currently near the carrying capacityof the habitat and it is likely that it will exceed this capacity in thenear future. Overbrowsing by a large population of deer will adverselyimpact important habitat used by migratory birds thereby reducing the abilityof the refuge to meet its primary purpose. The hunting activity itselfwould generally be confined to the upland areas of the refuge and causeminimal disturbance to migratory birds. Refuge regulations would be establishedto ensure the objectives of the deer hunt are met and to reduce space andtime conflicts with other permitted uses. A Section 7 evaluation concludesthat the proposed program ``will not affect'' any listed endangered orthreatened species. Opening the refuge to big game hunting would enhancethe ability of the refuge to achieve its primary purpose, is compatiblewith the purpose of the refuge, and would be in compliance with the NWRSAA.The estimated annual cost of the hunting program is $6,800. Within thecurrent annual budget for the refuge, the necessary funds are availableto administer the proposed hunting program. Therefore, opening Edwin B.Forsythe NWR to big game hunting would be in compliance with the RefugeRecreation Act. Supawna Meadows NWR was established in 1934 by Executive Order 6582 asa refuge and breeding ground for wild birds and animals. Originally knownas the Goose Pond Addition to the Killcohook Migratory Bird Refuge, theSupawna Meadows portion was separated from Killcohook (now known as theKillcohook Coordination Area) and renamed the Supawna Meadows NationalWildlife Refuge in 1974. It is proposed to open the refuge to big game(deer) hunting. Current habitat conditions indicate a deer population exceedingthe capacity of the area and further habitat deterioration is likely unlessnumbers are reduced. Frequent deer/vehicle collisions on public roads surroundingthe refuge and complaints of crop depredations from farmers around therefuge also indicate a high population. A deer population exceeding thecapacity of its habitat to support it results in the deterioration of thathabitat and is detrimental not only to the deer population but also thewide variety of other wild birds and animals found there. Such deteriorationwould be in direct conflict with the purpose of the refuge. A section 7evaluation concludes that the proposed hunting program ``will not affect''any endangered or threatened species. Opening Supawna Meadows NWR to biggame hunting would therefore be supportive of and compatible with the purposefor which the refuge was established and would be in compliance with theNWRSAA. The estimated annual cost of administering the hunting programis $6,000. Within the current refuge budget funds are sufficient to carryout the proposed program. Therefore, opening Supawna Meadows NWR to biggame hunting would be in compliance with the Refuge Recreation Act. Little River NWR was established in 1987 by authority of the MigratoryBird Conservation Act to preserve bottomland hardwood habitat for migratorywaterfowl, particularly mallards and wood ducks. It is proposed that therefuge be opened to upland game hunting (rabbit and squirrel) and sportfishing. Both of these activities would provide the public with an opportunityto enjoy wildlife-oriented activities while at the same time utilizinga renewable natural resource. Hunting of rabbits and squirrels will notinterfere with the continued preservation of the bottomland hardwood habitatnor cause undue disturbance to migratory waterfowl. As hunting would betaking place on the upland portions of the refuge and largely before significantnumbers of waterfowl are present, such hunting is compatible with refugepurposes. The sport fishing program would be confined to major stream coursesand would pose no conflicts with waterfowl production. A section 7 evaluationconcludes that the programs ``will not affect'' the continued existenceor habitat of any endangered or threatened species. Opening Little RiverNWR to upland game hunting and sport fishing would be compatible with thepurpose for which the refuge was established and therefore in compliancewith the NWRSAA. The annual cost of administering the program is estimatedat $2,000. Within the current annual refuge budget of $130,600 the necessaryfunds are available to administer these programs. Therefore, the openingof Little River NWR to upland game hunting and sport fishing would be incompliance with the Refuge Recreation Act.Salt Plains NWR was established in 1930 by Executive Order 5314 for thepurpose of providing a migration, resting and wintering area for migratorybirds. It is proposed to open the refuge to migratory birds and uplandgame hunting. Present populations of species to be hunted (primarily mourningdoves and quail) are adequate to support such a program and provide forthe public use of renewable natural resources. Under the proposed programonly a small portion of the refuge (about 4% of total area, comprised ofupland and associated croplands) will actually be hunted thus reducingdisturbance to migratory birds on the main portion of the refuge (SaltPlains Reservoir) to a minimum. The area proposed for hunting is used onlysparingly by waterfowl but provides good conditions for mourning dovesand quail and other upland species. Refuge regulations would limit timeand space conflicts with other permitted uses. A section 7 evaluation ofthe program concludes that opening the refuge to these activities ``willnot affect'' the continued existence or habitat of any endangered or threatenedspecies. Potential conflicts between hunt participants and listed species(whooping crane, bald eagle, interior least tern) would be avoided by leavingthose areas frequented by these species (mainly the reservoir area) closedto public use. Opening the refuge to migratory birds and upland game huntingwould contribute to the attainment of refuge objectives in terms of providingopportunities for wildlife_oriented recreation, would be compatible withthe purpose for which the refuge was established and thus in compliancewith the NWRSAA. The annual cost to administer the programs is estimatedat $2,100. Within the current annual refuge budget of $229,500 adequatefunds are available to administer the programs. Therefore, opening SaltPlains NWR to migratory birds and upland game hunting would be in compliancewith the Refuge Recreation Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291, ``Federal Regulation,'' of February 17, 1981, requiresthe preparation of regulatory impact analyses for major rules. A majorrule is one likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies or geographic regions; or significant adverseeffects on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete withforeign-based enterprises. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions.It is estimated that the proposed opening of these refuges to hunting andfishing will generate approximately 71,550 annual visits. Using data fromthe 1980 National Survey of Hunting, Fishing, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation,and the 1987 Economic Report of the President (Consumer Price Index), totalannual receipts generated from purchases of food, transportation, huntingequipment, fishing gear, fees, and licenses associated with these programsare expected to be approximately $2,406,429, or substantially less than$100 million. In addition, since these estimated receipts will be spreadover three states, the implementation of this rule should not have a significanteconomic impact on the overall economy, or a particular region, industryor group of industries, or level of government.With respect to small entities, this rule would have a positive aggregateeconomic effect on small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions.The proposed openings would provide recreational opportunities and generateeconomic benefits that would not otherwise exist, and will impose no newcosts on small entities. While the number of small entities likely to beaffected is not known, the number is judged to be small. Moreover, theadded cost to the Federal government of law enforcement, posting, etc.,needed to implement activities under this rule would be considerably lessthan the income generated from the implementation of these hunting and/orsport fishing programs.Accordingly, the Department of the Interior has determined that this ruleis not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 andwould not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C), environmental assessments havebeen prepared for these proposed openings.
