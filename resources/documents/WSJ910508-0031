That's what a federal judge here ruled in approving asettlement of a class-action case against Merrill Lynch andamp;Co., the U.S.'s largest securities firm.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein said Jean Ettinger,a Philadelphia school teacher, is entitled to an award of$6,000 just for filing her case against Merrill. Ms. Ettingerherself was shut out of a settlement the judge approved, butthe award granted her by the judge is to come out of thepayment to investors in the class.   The judge said he made the award &quot;given the uniquecircumstances&quot; of the case. But in an unusual step, he warnedthat he would impose &quot;very severe&quot; sanctions if any attorneyused the ruling as a precedent.   &quot;The decision is to have no precedential value of anykind, and should not be cited or otherwise relied upon in anunrelated case before this or any other court,&quot; JudgeEdelstein said sternly at a hearing yesterday. &quot;I am not surethat even this decision is correct,&quot; the judge candidlyadded.   An award for bringing class-action suits is rarely grantedin federal courts in New York, securities lawyers say. Incourts where such awards are more common, the cases typicallyhave involved antitrust or employment discrimination chargesand not investor-related cases against securities firms.   Yesterday's ruling came as Judge Edelstein approved asettlement that will pay investors $3.83 million to end sevenclass-action suits that were filed in 1984 and 1985. Thesuits alleged that Merrill didn't properly registerzero-coupon bonds they issued -- called &quot;TIGRs,&quot; or TreasuryInvestment Growth Receipts -- and charged excessivecommissions in selling them.   Ms. Ettinger filed one of the suits in 1984. But she wasshut out of the settlement because it covers only investorswho sold the bonds at a loss, says David H. Weinstein, herlawyer in Philadelphia. Ms. Ettinger, it turns out, had again on her TIGR investment. She couldn't be reached forcomment.   In court papers, Ms. Ettinger said she deserves the awardbecause of the &quot;time and effort&quot; devoted to the litigation.   Merrill has said that it settled the case to &quot;avoidexcessive litigation expenses and loss of time.&quot; It declinedto comment on the judge's award. But in a court brief,Merrill said that &quot;the practice of giving a named plaintiff abounty merely for bringing a class action -- especially atthe expense of the class whose interests he or she purportsto represent -- is dangerous and inappropriate.&quot;   Zero-coupon bonds pay no interest until they mature.Investors buy the bonds at a big discount to face value,which they collect at maturity -- sometimes as long as 30years later. The bonds in the Merrill case were derivativesof existing Treasury bonds.</TEXT></DOC>
