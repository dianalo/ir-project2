The coatings evaluatedincluded diffusion aluminides and metallic overlays of various compositions.Visual examination, optical metallography and scanning electron microscopyin conjunction with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis were used to evaluatethe coated hot section components after a 7940 hour field test in a CentaurT-4000 engine. The metallic overlay coatings showed superior hot corrosionprotection on blade platforms and blade airfoil stubs when compared withaluminide diffusion coatings. No differentiation in performance for individualrepresentatives of these two groups of blade coatings could be discerned.The protectiveness of the vane overlay coatings was observed to increasewith its chromium content. The metallic overlay vane coatings were moreprotective than the diffusion aluminides. An exception was the Cr-aluminidewhich showed comparable performance to a metallic overlay with intermediatechromium content on first-stage vanes. 28 refs., 54 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
