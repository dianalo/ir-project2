WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Najib vowed today thatanti-communist rebels would never take over the Afghan governmentand that Soviet military advisers would remain in Afghanistanindefinitely.   Najib said negotiations with U.S.-backed rebel forces inPakistan were continuing, but he said the alliance of seven rebelgroups has taken an ``illogical, rigid stand'' in negotiations on acoalition government.   Najib, who spoke at a news conference for foreign journalists,said the Afghan government was confident it could stave off theinsurgents after Soviet troops withdraw if ``outside interference''ceases, a reference to U.S. aid to the rebels.   ``The military cooperation of the Soviet Union with Afghanistanbegan 23 years prior to the April revolution,'' Najib said,referring to the Soviet-inspired coup 10 years ago that installed aMarxist government.   He said Soviet military assistance would not stop after thepullout of Kremlin troops, scheduled to begin on May 15 accordingto an accord signed in Geneva this month.   ``It is not our position to stop cooperating with the SovietUnion, especially when the situation is not settled yet,'' he said.   He declined to say how many Soviet military advisers wouldremain here after the withdrawal, and he said assistance from otherfriendly nations in Eastern Europe also was expected.   Najib, responding to a question, also said he would not considerleaving Afghanistan if the rebel forces take over.   ``We shall not allow such a thing, that the coalition governmentcome under the influence of these forces hostile to the policy ofnational reconciliation proclaimed in Afghanistan,'' he said.   National reconciliation is Najib's proposal for drawing in rebelleaders with his Marxist Peoples Democratic Party in hopes ofending the civil war.   Pakistan-based rebel groups have rejected the offers and vowedto continue their fight to oust the Moscow-backed government.   In an apparent bid to put together a leadership acceptable tothe Afghan people when Soviet troops leave, Najib said he offfereda role in the new government to former King Zahr Shah. He said themonarch, now living in Italy, has a responsibility to help hisnation.   Najib, who has been head of Kabul's government since May 1986,did not specify what position the king could fill if he returned toafghanistan.   Najib also confirmed his predecessor, Babrak Karmal, is in theSoviet Union, where he is under medical care.   The estimated 115,000 Soviet troops now in Afghanistan tobolster Najib's army are expected to complete the withdrawal by theend of the year. Soviet soldiers first entered the war in December1979.</TEXT></DOC>
