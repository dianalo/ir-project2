The new regulations are designed in recognitionof the differences between the OCS activities associated with the discovery,development, and production of oil, gas, and sulphur and those associatedwith minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. These regulations addressissues identified by MMS as well as issues raised by representatives ofindustry (potential OCS mineral lessees), other Federal Agencies, Stateand local governments, and the public. To accomplish this goal, it wasfelt that the new regulatory regime should be designed to do the following:(1) Recognize the special circumstances, issues, and requirements associatedwith the discovery, development, and production of OCS minerals other thanoil, gas, and sulphur;(2) Assure that States, and through the States local governments, whichare directly affected by OCS mineral mining activities are provided anopportunity for consultation and coordination on policy and planning decisionsrelating to the management of OCS resources;(3) Avoid or minimize conflicts between OCS mineral mining activities andother users and uses of OCS resources;(4) Balance orderly mineral resource development with protection of thehuman, marine, and coastal environments;(5) Insure the public a fair and equitable return on the resources of theOCS;(6) Preserve and maintain free enterprise competition;(7) Encourage development of new and improved technology for producingOCS mineral resources other than oil, gas, and sulphur which will avoidor minimize risk of damage to the human, marine, and coastal environments;and (8) Establish practices and procedures for postlease mineral activitiesand wise management of the natural resources of the OCS.This proposed rule is designed to govern postlease activities to discover,develop, produce, and process OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur.A final rule is to be published as the first part of the regulatory regimeto govern OCS mineral mining activities. It establishes practices and proceduresspecific to prelease activities associated with geological and geophysical(Gandamp;G) exploration and scientific research for OCS minerals other thanoil, gas, and sulphur. Regulations are also being proposed to govern theleasing of such OCS minerals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On September 28, 1945, the United States declared its jurisdiction overthe natural resources of the continental shelf with the Truman Proclamation,``Policy of the United States with Respect to the Natural Resources ofthe Subsoil and Seabed on the Continental Shelf.'' At the same time, PresidentTruman placed these natural resources under the jurisdiction of the Secretaryof the Interior (Secretary) by Executive Order pending enactment of legislation.Congress passed the OCS Lands Act (OCSLA) in 1953 and delegated the administrationof the OCS mineral resources of the United States to the Department ofthe Interior (DOI), giving legislative expression to the Truman Proclamation.Section 8(k) of the OCSLA provides specific legal authority for leasingminerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS. Used in conjunctionwith other applicable sections of the OCSLA and other laws, this authorityprovides the Secretary with adequate flexibility and guidelines to administeran OCS minerals mining program.This proposed rule is an action within the statutory authority of DOI andis intended to promote and encourage private enterprise in the developmentof economically sound and stable domestic materials industries in the UnitedStates which provides the appropriate level of protection for the human,marine, and coastal environments.Under the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and DevelopmentAct of 1980 (30 U.S.C. 1601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the President is ``* * * to encourage Federal agenciesto facilitate availability of domestic resources to meet critical needs.''The statute further mandates that the President direct ``* * * the Secretaryof the Interior to act immediately within the Department's statutory authorityto attain the goals contained in section 21a of this title * * *.'' Section21a of the Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 21a) providesas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Congress declares that it is the continuing policy of the FederalGovernment in the national interest to foster and encourage private enterprisein (1) the development of economically sound and stable domestic mining,minerals, metal and mineral reclamation industries, [and] (2) the orderlyand economic development of domestic mineral resources, reserves, and reclamationof metals and minerals to help assure satisfaction of industrial, securityand environmental needs, * * *.</ITAG>President Reagan reemphasized these themes in April 1982 by stating inthe National Minerals and Materials Program Plan that this country willseek to reduce its dependence on imported minerals by eliminating barriersto the development of marine mineral resources. The MMS believes that issuanceof comprehensive regulations for the guidance of activities associatedwith OCS mineral discovery, development, and production which recognizesthe need for protection of the environment and avoidance of unnecessaryconflicts with other users of the oceans is in full accord with Federalpolicies. Implementation of the proposed rule is appropriate in view ofthe resource potential in areas of U.S. jurisdiction and the long leadtimes projected for development of certain OCS minerals other than oil,gas, and sulphur.The lack of comprehensive regulations applicable to the discovery, delineation,development, and production of minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphurfrom the OCS may have inhibited interest in development of a domestic marinemining industry. This has not been the case in Europe and Asia where vigorousmarine mining industries have developed with government regulation. Thisproposed rule is intended to dispel uncertainty and demonstrate governmentalcommitment to OCS minerals development and production. Regulations in 30CFR Parts 251 and 256 are presently applicable to prelease Gandamp;G explorationand scientific research activities and to the leasing of all OCS minerals.However, those existing regulations were designed primarily for oil andgas and to a lesser degree sulphur, and MMS believes that there is a needfor regulations which are more specifically designed for use with OCS mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur. For such minerals, leasing and operatingcriteria with respect to lease size, lease terms, life of a lease, rentals,royalties, and operating conditions can be substantially different fromthose that are associated with oil, gas, and sulphur.In the United States, industry interest in OCS mining has been focusedon gold and other heavy mineral placers, strategic minerals, sand and gravel,and phosphorite. On March 11, 1988, the MMS published a Request for Commentsand Nominations for a Lease Sale in Norton Sound in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 8134). Table 1 lists the permits thathave been isued under existing regulations by MMS and its predecessor Agenciesto allow prospecting for OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Geological and Geophysical Permits Issued by DOI to Prospect for OCSMinerals Other Than Oil, Gas, and Sulphur</T4><H1>OCS region</H1><H1>Permittee</H1><H1>Minerals of interest</H1><H1>Year</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Atlantic<D>Newport News Shipbuilding</D><D>Phosphate</D><D>1966 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pacific<D>Ocean Resources, Inc</D><D>Phosphorite</D><D>1967 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Bear Creek Mining Co</D><D>......do</D><D>1967 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atlantic<D>Global Marine, Inc</D><D>Sand and gravel</D><D>1969 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Ocean International, Inc</D><D>Heavy minerals</D><D>1969 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pacific<D>Global Marine, Inc</D><D>Sand and gravel</D><D>1969 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atlantic<D>Deepsea Ventures, Inc</D><D>Manganese nodules</D><D>1970 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gulf of Mexico<D>Radcliff Materials, Inc</D><D>Sand and gravel</D><D>1975 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alaska<D>Harding Lawson</D><D>......do</D><D>1982 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Sohio</D><D>......do</D><D>1982 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Tenneco</D><D>......do</D><D>1982 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Geocubic</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Doa<D>Woodward</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Doa<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Sohio</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Dames andamp; Moore</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Harding Lawson</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>McClelland</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Doa<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1983 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Doa<D>Harding Lawson</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Doa<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Ertec</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Harding Lawson</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>MTS</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Comap</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Doa<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Sohio</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Doa<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Harding Lawson</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Union</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>McClelland</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1984 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>Harding Lawson</D><D>......do</D><D>1985 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Do<D>......do</D><D>......do</D><D>1986 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Atlantic b<D>E.I.

Sand and gravel are being produced from Lake Erie and in Long IslandSound and New York Harbor in New York's and New Jersey's State waters.Interest has been expressed in acquiring prospecting permits for sand andgravel in Federal offshore waters.  Due to the growing interest in OCS minerals, MMS is working closely withthe Bureau of Mines (BOM) to assess the economic feasibility on miningOSC minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. Two studies dealing withsand and gravel and heavy minerals were completed in early 1987. The studiesare ``An Economic Reconnaissance of Selected Sand and Gravel Deposits inthe U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone,'' Open File Report 3-87, and ``An EconomicReconnaissance of Selected Heavy Mineral Placer Deposits in the U.S. ExclusiveEconomic Zone,'' Open File Report 4-87. Both of these reports are availablefrom the Bureau of Mines, Division of Minerals Availability, 2401 E Street,NW., Washington, DC 20241. Preliminary indications are that heavy mineralplacers, sand and gravel, and precious metal placers in near-shore watershave the greatest potential for near term development. Other publishedstudies on OCS minerals include the evaluation of cobalt-rich manganesecrusts, polymetallic sulfides, and phosphorites.  The MMS is working closely with a number of coastal States through jointState/Federal task forces and other arrangements to study the engineering,economic, and environmental aspects associated with marine mining. A specialworking group with Alaska and 5 task forces have been established involving9 coastal States: Hawaii; Oregon and California; Georgia; North Carolina;and Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Most mineral activity on continental shelves is for sand and gravel foruse as construction aggregate and fill. The most extensive marine sandmining occurs in Japan where approximately 1,000 small dredges produce60 to 70 million tons of sand (and some gravel) annually for use in concreteas well as for fill. This is about one-fifth of all sand and gravel minedin Japan.  The other major sand and gravel mining area in the world is northern Europe,in the North Sea and English Channel, where about 100 dredges annuallyproduce 40 to 50 million tons of sand and gravel, largely for use as concreteaggregate. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, and France havebeen the major producers. The United Kingdom obtains an estimated 15 percentof its total concrete aggregate by marine mining. Next to sand and gravel, the largest marine mining operations are for tinin Indonesia and Thailand where significant production results from seabeddredging and where continued exploration and development can be anticipated.In Thailand, large-scale marine tin mining operations account for halfof that nation's production which totaled 37,000 metric tons (tin content)in 1986. Phosphorite deposits also hold promise for development in the near term.One of the most promising prospects are the phosphorite deposits of theChatham Rise east of New Zealand. A New Zealand company, Fletcher Challenge,has explored the deposits on the Chatham Rise in association with two WestGerman firms, Preussag and Salzgitter. It has been reported that Germanmining engineers are designing mining equipment to recover these depositswhich lie in 1,200 feet of water. Other prospective phosphorite depositsare located off the West Coast of Africa. These deposits have been underinvestigation by a French firm. A major deep ocean project in the Red Sea now under consideration is thedevelopment of metalliferous muds containing zinc, copper, and silver in6,500 feet of water. This project is now entering the pilot stage of productionthat will involve a 5-year investigation of mining and processing strategies.A Saudi/Sudanese joint commission is managing the project with technicalassistance being provided by German and French firms. Exploration activity for manganese nodules is also continuing, at a pacesignificantly reduced from the 1970's, in international waters in the Clarion-Clippertonfracture zone in the northeastern equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean.The West German firm, Preussag, in cooperation with Japanese and U.S. firms,is also conducting detailed investigations of cobalt-rich manganese crustsin the Hawaiian Archipelago and Johnston Island Exclusive Economic Zone(EEZ) as well as other mid-Pacific areas. One or more Japanese firms havebeen exploring for polymetallic sulfides in the Pacific basin for the past2 years and have now added cobalt-rich manganese crusts in mid-Pacificareas to their exploration objectives. Minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS include over 80 differentcommodities, including a number of strategic minerals with limited domesticavailability. Although OCS resource data are limited, estimated quantitiesof minerals associated with cobalt-rich manganese crusts would appreciablyincrease the U.S. reserve base for strategic materials such as cobalt,nickel, and manganese. Existing world ore reserves of these minerals areadequate for the foreseeable future, but they are controlled by relativelyfew producer countries that could potentially have leverage over commodityprices. The OCS deposits that have nearer term economic potential include heavymineral placers containing gold, chromium, platinum-group minerals, tin,and titanium, as well as sand and gravel for construction material. Phosphoritecrusts and nodules, as well as extensive bedded deposits off the U.S. eastcoast, are a potential future source of phosphate_now a major U.S. mineralexport and an essential mineral import to many world agricultural regions.The OCS polymetallic sulfide deposits containing zinc, copper, lead, silver,and other metals have long-term but little near-term potential as theypose new mining problems and must compete with a large number of alternativeonshore domestic and foreign sources. Economic production from OCS deposits,as in onshore deposits, is ultimately dependent upon cost-competitive miningsystems, ore grade, and commodity markets. The MMS recognizes the potential for adverse environmental impacts as aresult of OCS mineral activities. These possible impacts will be identifiedand appropriate mitigation measures determined as part of DOI's environmentalreview process. Some potential impacts that may be postulated now willnever come to pass as experience provides added knowledge and modifiesexpectations and practices. Under DOI's case-by-case approach, issues commonto all forms of OCS mining and all commodities will be covered by regulationsgoverning Gandamp;G prosepcting, scientific research, leasing, and operations.Using this case-by-case approach, mitigation measures can be defined withspecificity as mineral resource targets are identified and recovery methodsare proposed. Commodity-specific issues will be covered by specially designedlease stipulations specified at the time the OCS minerals are offered forlease. Site-specific issues identified after the issuance of a lease willbe addressed through conditions of approval for the conduct of postleaseoperations. Based on this approach and information obtained as a resultof MMS's Environmental Studies Program (ESP), MMS believes that protectionof the environment can be compatible with the recovery of minerals fromthe OCS.The MMS has prepared OCS Report No. 87-0035, ``Environmental Effects Overview:Marine Mining on the Outer Continental Shelf,'' to provide the public withan early overview of the likely mining activities and potential impactson the environment resulting from OCS mining operations. The likely miningactivities and their potential impacts will be covered in more detail inthe environmental evaluations carried out as part of the decisionmakingprocess for all phases of OCS mining.Detailed coverage of potential environmental issues is not practicableat this point since may uncertainties remain at this early stage with respectto the nature, magnitude, location, and rate of future mining. Many typesof ore deposits exist in a variety of environmental settings requiringa diverse set of mining technologies. This raises questions whether a meaningfulassessment can be conducted at this time. However, this regulatory programis designed to ensure that environmental evaluations will be prepared priorto approval of postlease operations.Further, through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process,MMS's preparation of prelease environmental evaluations addressing proposalsto lease commodities in identified areas will provide a series of opportunitiesfor public involvement in the evaluation of environmental impacts. It isanticipated that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be preparedin connection with the decision to hold the first lease sale in an area.The additional site-specific and technology-specific environmental evaluationswhich will be conducted with respect to proposed postlease operations willprovide additional opportunities for public participation.Two sale-specific EIS's have been completed or are in the process of completion.They are for (1) sand and gravel in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska publishedas a final EIS in March 1983, and (2) cobalt-rich manganese crusts in theHawaii and Johnston Island EEZ's published as a draft EIS. The notice ofavailability for the Hawaii draft EIS was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 27, 1987 (52 FR 9958), with public commentsdue by June 25, 1987. The comment period was subsequently reopened fromDecember 10, 1987, until February 8, 1988. A draft EIS for metalliferoussulfides in the Gorda Ridge area off California and Oregon was publishedin December 1983. This EIS was cancelled in a <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice dated March 31, 1988 (53 FR 10447). OnMarch 11, 1988, the MMS published a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EnvironmentalImpact Statement in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 8134) in association with its requestsfor Comments and Nominations for a Lease Sale in Norton Sound. Lease saleEIS's such as these will be augmented by additional environmental documentationprior to the approval of postlease development and production operations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program History</ITAG>Federal study of OSC mining began as an outgrowth of the concern with mineralshortages during and after World War II and the Korean Conflict. In theearly 1950's, President Truman created the Paley Commission to investigatemeans to avoid shortages. This was followed by major studies by the NationalAcademy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), andothers which further focused attention on the critical nature of steadilydeclining mineral resources in terms of U.S. and foreign supplies, U.S.vulnerability, and national goals.During the period of 1958 through 1988, seven lease offerings were completedfor salt, sulphur, and phosphate minerals using the regulations promulgatedunder the OCSLA as a basis for the actions. Over $54 million were receivedby the Federal Government in bonuses and rents during this period (seeTable 2).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2<T4>Gulf of Mexico Salt and Sulphur Lease Offerings</T4><H1>Lease offering</H1><H1>Date of offering</H1><H1>Location</H1><H1>No. of tracts offered</H1><H1>Acres offered</H1><H1>No. of tracts bid on</H1><H1>Total bonus high bid</H1><H1>No. of tracts leased</H1><H1>No. of bids rejected</H1><H1>No. of bids received</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>10/23/54 </D><D>Sul-LA </D><D>108 </D><D>523,630 </D><D>5 </D><D>$1,233,500 </D><D>5 </D><D>0 </D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8 <D>5/19/60 </D><D>Sa-LA </D><D>10 </D><D>22,085 </D><D>1 </D><D>75,250 </D><D>1 </D><D>0 </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13 <D>12/14/65 </D><D>Sul-TX </D><D>658 </D><D>957,520 </D><D>50 </D><D>33,740,309 </D><D>50 </D><D>0 </D><D>113</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">17 <D>9/05/67 </D><D>Sa-LA </D><D>8 </D><D>16,995 </D><D>1 </D><D>30,564 </D><D>1 </D><D>0 </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20 <D>5/13/69 </D><D>Sul-LA </D><D>120 </D><D>165,605 </D><D>38 </D><D>3,678,045 </D><D>4 </D><D>34 </D><D>43</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">S/S <D>2/24/88 </D><D>Sul-CGOM </D><D>51 </D><D>593,971 </D><D>14 </D><D>15,149,327 </D><D>14 </D><D>0 </D><D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Totals <D> </D><D> </D><D>955 </D><D>2,279,806 </D><D>109 </D><D>53,906,995 </D><D>75 </D><D>34 </D><D>183 </D><F>Total Amount of All Bids Received for All Lease Offerings_$82,527,068.</F><F>Total Amount of All Rentals for All Lease Offerings_$297,860.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>10,L2,i1,s10,9,xs80,9,9,10,9,9,9,9</C><T4>Pacific Phosphate Lease Offering</T4><H1>Lease offering</H1><H1>Date of offering</H1><H1>Location</H1><H1>No. of tracts offered</H1><H1>Acres offered</H1><H1>No. of tracts bid on</H1><H1>Total bonus high bid</H1><H1>No. of tracts leased</H1><H1>No. of bids rejected</H1><H1>No. of bids received</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">PH <D>12/15/61 </D><D>So-CA </D><D>16 </D><D>80,640 </D><D>6 </D><D>$122,000 </D><D>6 </D><D>0 </D><D>6</D><F>Total Amount of All Bids Received_$122,000.</F><F>(Total bonuses (and rentals) were refunded due to discovery of unexplodedNaval projectiles on ocean floor.)</F></ITAG></ITAG>In its 1970 report to Congress, the Public Land Law Review Commission (Commission)concluded that the regulations associated with the OCSLA, designed primarilyfor oil and gas development, were not conducive to the development of otherminerals. The Commission also stated that a location system is not desirableand that competitive bidding procedures should be utilized where competitionis known to exist. The rules being proposed for the leasing of OCS mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur are consistent with the Commission's report.The benefits of leasing were reiterated in 1975 by the NAS/NAE Panel onOperational Safety in Marine Mining in its comprehensive report entitled``Mining in the Outer Continental Shelf and the Deep Ocean.'' This studyexamined basic issues including the importance and potential of OCS mining,mining technology, environmental protection and safety, regulations, andleasing. The panel recommended that operations be undertaken in representativeareas. Draft OCS hard minerals leasing and postlease operating regulations anda draft EIS were published in 1974. Following public comment, DOI undertooka series of actions culminating in the present policy of leasing on a case-by-casebasis in consultation with adjacent States. A proposed long-range programfor resource evaluation and lease management was drawn up by the U.S. GeologicalSurvey (USGS) in 1974 but was not funded. In November 1977, the Directors of the USGS and the Bureau of Land Management(BLM) recommended establishment of an inter-Agency task force to developpolicy recommendations for leasing OCS minerals other than oil, gas, andsulphur. The resulting Program Feasibility Document, published in 1979with 18 technical appendices, concluded that sufficient national interestand economic incentives existed to support selected commercial-scale miningin the OCS. On January 19, 1982, DOI announced approval of the development of a leasingprogram for OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur on a case-by-casebasis. The Secretary published a Notice of interpretation in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 8, 1982 (47 FR 55313), relating toDOI's jurisdiction over minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. Furtherclarification was published on January 19, 1983 (48 FR 2450). The case-by-case approach to the leasing of OCS minerals other than oil,gas, and sulphur was selected to provide practical experience with thevariety of potentially reservable mineral resources found in the OCS, thedifferent potential environmental settings, and the range of potentialtechnology that might be used. The case-by-case approach provides for managementflexibility, opportunity for effective coastal State participation, andcomprehensive environmental review. The regulations will establish a broadregulatory framework; the subsequent lease stipulations will define site-,commodity-, and technology-specific requirements; and the appropriate publicand environmental review of leasing proposals and proposed postlease operationswill facilitate the consultation and coordination processes authorizedunder Federal law. On April 9, 1986, MMS published an advance Notice of proposed rulemakingfor regulations to govern postlease operations (51 FR 12163). Responsesto the advance Notice for postlease operations are summarized in the sectionon Public Comments and Agency Responses. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulation Organization </ITAG>This proposed rule covers activities conducted on a lease for mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur in the OCS. The rule is subdivided intofive subparts. The vast majority of the provisions fall under two subparts,Subpart B, Jurisdiction and Responsibilities of Director, and Subpart C,Obligations and Responsibilities of Lessees. The remaining subparts areSubpart A, General; Subpart D, Payments; and Subpart E, Appeals. Whilemany activities are covered by the provisions of a particular subpart,some activities are subject to provisions contained in more than one subpart.For example, suspensions of operations are addressed in both Subparts Band C, because they can either be directed by MMS or requested by a lessee.The provisions which govern lessee obligations and responsibilities foractivities to be carried out on a lease are covered in Subpart C. Basically,a lessee's activities will fall into one or more of three categories: Exploration,testing, or mining and processing. Activities must be conducted in accordancewith an approved plan. No activity may be conducted that is not includedin the description of activities under an approved plan. An exception ismade for preliminary activities; i.e., those casual-entry activities whichhave little or no environmental impact and which are necessary to preparea reasonable delineation, testing, or mining plan. Requirements for thesafe conduct of mining activities and environmental protection and monitoringare also in Subpart C. To aid the lessee, reporting and recordkeeping requirementsother than those associated with delineation, testing, and mining plansare given in andSection; 282.31. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Proposed Regulations </ITAG>Provisions of the proposed rule are discussed below. The explanation givenis designed to avoid confusion and provide clarification. Comments arespecifically invited on the issues discussed. <T3>Public Participation. </T3>Opportunities for public participation similarto those that are part of the prospecting and the proposed leasing processesare also proposed for inclusion in the review, evaluation, and approvalprocess for postlease activities. For example, a site-specific environmentalevaluation will be made in association with the technical and environmentalevaluation of activities proposed in delineation, testing, and mining plans.Members of the public who wish to review and comment on proposed plansmay arrange for access to the nonproprietary portions of each plan whileit is being evaluated by MMS. Where applicable, States will have additionalreview opportunities under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Are there any other areas where opportunities for public participationshould be provided?<T3>Data and information to be made available to the public.</T3> The ruleproposes that proprietary Gandamp;G interpretations, maps, and other dataand information (including commercial and financial information) requiredto be submitted under the proposed rule will be protected from unauthorizedrelease so long as the lease is held on the lands involved. The proposedprovision to protect proprietary data and information from unauthorizeddisclosure for the duration of the lease parallels the protection thatis provided for data and information submitted under onshore mineral leasesfor minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. This proposal is based uponthe view that during the development phase of an offshore mineral industryproprietary data and information submitted by a lessee should be protectedfor at least as long as similar data and information would be protectedunder rules governing onshore mineral leases. The MMS bases the determination that particular data or information areproprietary on several criteria. Should these rules detail the categoriesto be considered proprietary, and if so, what should the categories be?<T3>Mining units.</T3> It is anticipated that leases for minerals otherthan oil, gas, and sulphur will cover an area that embraces one or moreeconomically minable orebodies. Section 282.11(d) provides for the formationof mining units in order that orebodies which underlie portions of morethan one lease may be mined in the most efficient and economical manner.Operations on any lease included in the mining unit will be consideredas operations on each of the leases within the mining unit and will keepeach of those leases in force even if there is no production from an individuallease. Minimum royalties paid on any Federal lease in the unit can be creditedagainst the royalties due on production under any Federal lease in theunit. Leases on disputed lands and State leases may be included in miningunits in accordance with agreements between the Governor and the Secretary,pursuant to andSection;282.8. However, all payments due under State and Federalleases shall be accounted for separately. <T3>Bonds.</T3> Section 282.40 provides for the submission of a suretyor personal bond prior to the commencement of any activity on a leasehold.The purpose of the bond is to protect the Government's financial interestin the event a lessee fails to meet a royalty or other obligation undera lease. <T3>Plans.</T3> Sections 282.21 through 282.27 require a lessee to submitand obtain the Director's approval for comprehensive delineation, testing,or mining plans, as appropriate, before significant activity can beginon a lease. The approval process may be iterative, requiring the lesseeto resubmit the plans containing modified sections as necessary. Certainpreliminary activities such as bathymetric and geophysical surveying whichwould not cause adverse environmental impacts are exempt from prior approval;however, the Director must be notified at least 30 days in advance of theinitiation of preliminary activities. These activities may be necessaryto supplement information developed through prelease prospecting activitiesin order to better identify site-specific exploration targets. Delineation,testing, and mining plans must describe in detail the activities to beconducted including exploration, mining, mineral processing methods andrates, transportation corridors, equipment, time periods, locations, andthe nature and degree of any potential environmental impacts of the activitiesproposed. Sufficient information must be provided so that the Directorwill have a basis on which to make informed judgments with respect to theplan's proposed activities and MMS's responsibilities for natural resourceconservation and protection of human life and the environment. Approvalsof proposed activities described in a plan are contingent upon the resultsof MMS's technical and environmental evaluations of the lessee's abilityto comply with the requirements of the lease and applicable laws and regulationswhile performing the activities described in the plan. The need for plans governing exploration and testing activities will dependupon the availability of adequate data and information to develop a comprehensivemining plan. As an example, it is anticipated that most sand and graveloperations will not need a delineation or testing plan. Knowledge of thedeposit and the existence of tested mining methods could allow a lesseeto submit a mining plan without conducting postlease exploration or testingactivities. The testing plan provides for an interim phase during whichextraction technologies and equipment can be evaluated and operating experiencedeveloped. Once sufficient information is available, the lessee may prepareand submit a mining plan. Plans are to include detailed descriptions forthe abandonment of lease operations including cleanup actions. When environmental data and information are insufficient to allow impactassessment, proposed plans must include descriptions of the lessee's comprehensiveplans to monitor the environmental effects of proposed operations, includingthe time period to be covered and the scope of the proposed monitoringprogram. It is anticipated that there will be some degree of environmentalmonitoring described in each plan submitted for MMS approval. If sufficientinformation is not available, the Director may require incorporation ofcontingency measures into a lessee's proposed plan. The contingency measureswill establish procedures that employees of the lessee are to follow inthe event of any equipment or procedural failure that could threaten safetyor seriously harm or damage the marine, coastal, or human environment.Proposed changes in delineation, testing, and mining plans that reflectchanged conditions, new data or information, oversights, etc., must beapproved by the Director prior to the initiation of those changes. <T3>Platforms.</T3> Provisions are included to require that installationsand structures placed on the OCS are designed, fabricated, installed, used,inspected, and maintained in a manner that assures their structural integrity.In those cases where a platform or other structure is fixed or bottom founded,the lessee is required to comply with the requirements of Subpart I of30 CFR Part 250 (published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 1, 1988 (53 FR 10739)) which governthe design, fabrication, and installation of OCS platforms and other bottom-foundedstructures. This approach utilizes an existing process for approving OCSinstallations and structures and for assuring the structural integrityof those facilities throughout their productive life. Subpart I sets outa two-tier system which requires third-party verification and more extensivedocumentation when an installation or structure utilizes unique technologies.In those instances where operations will be conducted from floating platformsor vessels, there are a number of applicable U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) requirementsthat relate to navigational aids and the stationkeeping ability of thevessel. <T3>Drilling.</T3> Drilling operations associated with OCS minerals exploration,testing, and mining will normally require many more drill holes of a smallerdiameter to a shallower depth than is the case with oil and gas operations.For example, in the evaluation and development of a placer deposit of goldor cassiterite (tin oxide), drill holes generally will be less than 30meters (m) deep and spaced as closely as 30 m apart. To evaluate such adeposit, containing 60 million m\3\ of ore for 20 years production, some2,000 holes each perhaps 20 centimeter (cm) diameter and 25 m deep maybe required. To develop a deposit of bedded phosphorite for slurry miningthrough boreholes, a similar spacing of 50 cm diameter holes to depthsof several hundred meters may be required. To evaluate a massive sulfidedeposit, several thousand small-diameter (less than 10 cm) drill holesmay be required. In each case, the drilling technology used will be quitedifferent and not interchangeable. Drilling for hard mineral resourcesgenerally will not be done in horizons that contain oil, gas, or geothermalresources, but where this might arise, appropriate safety measures willbe required. Provision is made in the proposed rules for appropriate blowoutprevention equipment to be installed and operated. The procedures requiredwill be the same as those required under normal oil and gas operationsin the OCS, found in Subpart D of 30 CFR Part 250 (published April 1, 1988(53 FR 10714)). Special attention is also given to the protection of freshwateraquifers from contamination through procedures for approved penetrationand sealing of aquifers. <T3>Disposal of Waste.</T3> The MMS recognizes that various aspects ofOCS mining operations associated with minerals other than oil, gas, andsulphur will require that the lessee dispose of waste generated by miningand processing activities. Since the nature and extent of OCS mining activities will vary widely,MMS cannot accurately project the additional environmental requirementsor safeguards which may be required. Under the proposed rule, delineation,testing, and mining plans are to include a detailed description of thecycle of all materials, the method of discharge and disposal of waste andrefuse, and their chemical and physical characteristics. The MMS's evaluationof each plan will address the proposed methods of waste disposal to assurethat disposal will be conducted in an environmentally responsible manner.The lessee must then follow the approved plan. In many cases, the disposal of waste material will be governed by regulationsof Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other Federal Agencies. Thelessee must comply with the applicable requirements of those Agencies.For example, discharge of material in the OCS may require compliance withappropriate EPA or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) regulations. TheMMS believes that the provisions of the proposed rule in combination withthe regulations of other Agencies are the best way to address disposalof waste generated by OCS mining activities. <T3>Environmental Protection Measures.</T3>_(1) <T3>Plans.</T3> As discussed earlier, MMS has prepared a general environmentaloverview and anticipates more detailed coverage of environmental issuesduring sale-specific environmental evaluations. Thus, additional opportunitiesfor public comment on environmental issues will be made available priorto issuance of an OCS lease for minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur.The environmental protection measures provided in the proposed operatingregulations are intended to supplement the special lease stipulations requiredas a result of environmental evaluations conducted prior to the lease sale.Requiring that the lessee submit plans to MMS for approval prior to conductingoperations on a lease will enable MMS to evaluate operators' plans at varioustimes during OCS mining operations. At each stage of operation, the lesseewill describe the activities to be performed, the potential environmentaleffects, and the mitigation measures to be implemented. The MMS will approvea plan only when appropriate environmental safeguards and adequate mitigationmeasures are contained in the plan. In addition, no changes can be madein the operations being conducted under an approved plan without the priorapproval of MMS for the specific changes, including changes in environmentalsafeguards and mitigation measures. (2) <T3>Baseline data.</T3> A reasonable knowledge of the lease area is a prerequisiteto the determination of the potential environmental effects of proposedactivities on a lease. Under the proposed rule, the Director may requirea lessee to collect additional data prior to approval of a planned activity.The Director may also require a lessee to monitor the approved activitiesfor unanticipated environmental impacts in accordance with a monitoringplan (andSection;282.28(b)). Some data needs are expected to be lease-specific.The MMS expects that lessees will obtain and submit information on benthiccommunities and archaeological resources on the lease. In those instances where additional information is needed, it is anticipatedthat the lessee will be asked to obtain and submit such information beforea plan is approved. (3) <T3>Monitoring.</T3> There are several objectives of monitoring, as specifiedin andSection;282.28(c)(1), but the most important is the need to ensurethe early and accurate detection of environmental effects. This requirementis applicable not only to mining plans (andSection;282.24) but to delineationplans (andSection;282.22) and testing plans (andSection;282.23) as well. Thetesting phase of activities should provide an excellent indication of short-term,lease-specific environmental effects. Monitoring of full-scale mining activitiescould still be required, even if no significant problems are detected duringthe test-mining phase. Monitoring during mining could also be requiredto verify predictions of the effects of scaling on equipment or the durationof operations and to test predictions of the environmental impacts of approvedmining activities based upon test activities carried out on a reduced scale.Monitoring requirements are expected to be more intensive during the earlyyears of exploration, testing, and development of commercial-scale mining.As reliable data and information are collected and analyzed, the levelof monitoring will be required so long as mining activities on the leasepose a threat to the environment. The MMS will utilize compliance inspectorsto ensure that the approved mining and monitoring programs are being adheredto (andSection;282.28(c)(3)). The MMS is not including a generic list of parameters to be examined duringmonitoring in these regulations. The environmental evaluation preparedfor a lease sale is expected to identify parameters of concern to the areaoffered for lease. (4) <T3>Technological Standards.</T3> It is not possible at this stage to definespecific economically feasible mining technologies as being the best availableand safest technologies (BAST). Whenever failure of equipment would posea serious threat to safety, health, or the environment, MMS's technicaland environmental review of a lessee's proposed delineation, testing, ormining plan will include consideration of whether the proposed activitiesrepresent BAST. Each plan submitted for MMS approval is to identify thealternative technologies considered and the reasons for not selecting analternative technology. (5) <T3>Mitigation.</T3> The MMS recognizes the potential for adverse environmentalimpacts and believes that mitigation is an important component of an environmentallysound mining program. The potential for a specific impact to occur willbe assessed and, where appropriate, mitigation measures will be identified.Where appropriate, lease stipulations will be used to identify specificmitigation measures to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on the environment.Site-specific issues identified after the issuance of a lease will be addressedduring the review and evaluation of activities described in a proposeddelineation, testing, or mining plan. All plans submitted for approvalwill be required to include appropriate mitigation measures to avoid orminimize adverse impacts on the environment. (6) <T3>Contingency strategy.</T3> It is in the lessee's best interest to ensurethat its activities are carried out in accordance with its plan of operations.Thus, it is unlikely that operational failures which pose a threat of seriousharm or damage to the marine, coastal, or human environment will occur.However, MMS recognizes that operational failures can happen, and thatplans for taking corrective action should be in place when the technologybeing used and the sensitivities of the environmental settings involvedrequire added assurances of environmental protection. The proposed rulerecognizes the need for contingency plans in andSection;andSection;228.26 and282.28. The MMS will assess the need for contingency plans during the environmentalevaluation of a proposed lease sale and during the evaluation of individualplans. (7) <T3>Onshore.</T3> The MMS has no direct authority relating to onshore activitiesassociated with OCS mining. However, the MMS's environmental evaluationof a delineation, testing, or mining plan will include an assessment ofthe impacts of known onshore activities associated with OCS mining activities.For example, when OCS produced minerals are to be processed onshore, MMSwill seek a joint environmental evaluation to satisfy the responsibilitiesof Federal and State agencies for the protection of the environment. Themechanisms for consultation and coordination established by joint State/Federaltask forces and other arrangements will facilitate the development of ajoint evaluation of potential environmental impacts onshore. The lesseewill be expected to consult with MMS as early as possible concerning theinformation it must submit to MMS regarding potential impacts of proposedmining and processing activities on the environment. Consideration will also be given in the environmental evaluation of a planwhen a lessee proposes to process minerals overseas in accordance withExecutive Order 12114, which requires the environmental review of majorFederal actions abroad. However, information on the socio-economic impactsof foreign processing is not required. <T3>Reports and Records.</T3> Section 282.29 specifies the reports of postleaseactivities that are required and their contents and timeframes for submission.It also specifies which records are to be retained and for what periodof time. The section provides that the Director may inspect or copy anyof the records and may inspect or take cuts of any geological samples,cuttings, or cores that are taken from an OCS lease. These reports andrecords are necessary to enable MMS to assure that operations are beingconducted in a safe and environmentally sound manner in accordance withan approved plan, to determine whether production is being properly measuredand royalties properly paid, and to evaluate the economic potential ofnearby tracts to identify areas to be offered at future lease sales. The reports required to be submitted are: (1) A monthly or quarterly report of production and environmental monitoringresults. Submission of these reports is required beginning with the monththat production begins and continuing until the lease terminates, unlessthe Director suspends the requirement during a suspension of production.The report shall contain the identity, quality, quantity, and value ofeach of the minerals produced, sold, or disposed of, and other informationneeded to verify royalty due the Federal Government. Comments are requested on whether monthly or quarterly reports should berequired. (2) A quarterly report on the status of approved exploration and/or testingactivities and the results of the environmental monitoring program. Thereport shall contain a listing of exploration and/or testing activitiesconducted during the calendar quarter. (3) A final report on approved exploration and/or testing activities andthe results of the environmental monitoring program. This report requiresmore detailed information on the activities and is required to be submittedwithin 3 months after completion of activities. Maps of leases showing areas of exploration, testing, and/or mining areto be kept up to date and the accuracy of maps certified by a professionalengineer or land surveyor. Maps would be submitted to the Director annuallyor at such other times as may be prescribed. <T3>Methods of Royalty Calculation.</T3> The MMS will follow its RoyaltyManagement's regulations contained in 30 CFR Chapter II, Subchapter A,for product valuation and the collection of royalties. Specific regulations have been included in the proposed leasing rules,30 CFR Part 281. Comments are invited on the methods for establishing productvalue and the procedures for collecting royalties. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments and Agency Responses</ITAG>The following discussion summarizes the comments received as a result ofthe requests for comments and recommendations contained in the advancenotice of proposed rulemaking. Agency responses are also included.<T3>Comment</T3>_Several commenters stated that the regulations are premature,the MMS should await new legislation, and that regulations should be preparedonly after offshore mining is determined to be commercially feasible andthe economics of specific types of minerals can be determined. Other commentersstated that regulations are needed and timely. <T3>Response_</T3>The MMS does not agree that the regulations are premature,that it should await new legislation, or that regulations should be preparedonly after OCS mining is determined to be commercially feasible. Section8(k) of the OCSLA states, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary is authorized to grant to the qualified persons offeringthe highest cash bonuses on a basis of competitive bidding leases of anymineral other than oil, gas, and sulphur in any area of the Outer ContinentalShelf not then under lease for such mineral upon such royalty, rental,and other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe at the timeof offering the area for lease.</ITAG>Thus, section 8(k) specifically and clearly authorizes the Secretary tolease minerals in the OCS other than oil, gas, and sulphur. Mining companyrepresentatives have stated on a number of occasions that without regulationsin place they cannot accurately predict the economics of a mining operationnor can they raise capital for the venture unless the rules they will beworking under are known. It is necessary that the regulations be in placein order that the mining industry and other interests have advance noticeof the rules that will govern OCS mining activities.<T3>Comment_</T3>Two commenters stated that the proposed regulations shouldfollow the same framework as the oil and gas operating regulations. <T3>Response_</T3>These proposed regulations follow the framework of regulationsgoverning mineral activities on public lands onshore. The DOI has beenregulating exploration, development, and production activities associatedwith minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur for almost 70 years. TheDOI recognizes that many of the operating requirements for those mineralsare different from the requirements associated with oil, gas, and sulphur.The proposed rules are written in language that is familiar to the miningindustry.<T3>Comment_</T3>One commenter stated that consultation and coordinationwith States and other Federal Agencies should be done through MMS and thatMMS should be involved in any negotiations with State authorities for onshoreservices and facilities needed by lessees.<T3>Response_</T3>It is envisioned that State/Federal consultation andcoordination activities will be continued from prior to the identificationof areas of interest through and including abandonment of production activities.Opportunities are being provided for States and other Federal Agenciesto review and provide comments and recommendations with respect to prospecting,leasing, exploration, testing, production, and abandonment proposals. However,it is not anticipated that MMS will be actively involved in the negotiationswith adjacent State authorities for onshore facilities and services.<T3>Comment_</T3>The MMS should be solely responsible for approving plans,abandonment of operations, and compliance on OCS leases.<T3>Response_</T3>In the final analysis, the MMS will have primary responsibilityfor plan approval. That approval will be given after consultation withadjacent States and other Federal Agencies. Approval will be conditionedupon the lessee's compliance with applicable provisions of law and implementingregulations, for example, the National Pollutant Discharge EliminationSystem (NPDES), as appropriate. The MMS will also exercise primary responsibilityfor approval of the lessee's proposed abandonment of operations, inspectionsto assure compliance, and other activities covered by these regulations.Other Federal Agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA), USCG, and EPA, which have authorities and responsibilities foroffshore activities under the OCSLA or other legislation, will independentlyexercise those authorities and responsibilities.<T3>Comment_</T3>One commenter states there should be no areawide salessimilar to oil and gas.<T3>Response_</T3>The MMS does not anticipate that areawide sales willbe held. However, a number of tracts may be offered in order to obscurethe identity of the tract or tracts of interest when a mining company hasrequested a lease offering. It is also anticipated that some lease offeringsmay offer relatively large tracts for lease. Such offerings would be designedto assure that the party who discovers an ore body earns leasehold rightsto the discovered mineral.<T3>Comment_</T3>Regulations should require that documents addressing environmentalimpacts specify, in detail, the mining process and the ore beneficiationprocess.<T3>Response</T3>_The MMS will require that lessees submit mining planswhich include sufficient detail in the descriptions of the proposed miningand ore beneficiation processes to enable MMS to verify the identity ofany potential adverse environmental impacts that might result from theproposed mining and processing activities.<T3>Comment_</T3>Regulations should describe EPA's permit-issuance processand information needs.<T3>Response</T3>_Lessees operating under the proposed rule should be awareof the potential need to satisfy certain permit requirements of other FederalAgencies. In some instances, lessees may need to obtain an ocean dumpingpermit. However, it is not necessary or appropriate to include referencesto permit requirements of other Agencies in these regulations. The lesseeis responsible for knowing and satisfying all applicable Federal, State,and local permit requirements.<T3>Comment</T3>_An environmental report should be required with all postleaseoperating plans as for oil and gas.<T3>Response</T3>_An applicant seeking permission to conduct activitiesauthorized under the proposed rule will be required to submit environmentaldata and information regarding the area of activity and potential impactsthat may result from the proposed activity. The MMS will evaluate the proposedactivities to assure that they are technically sound, properly mitigated,and environmentally responsible.<T3>Comment</T3>_Regulations should specify under what conditions the Secretarycould cancel a lease.<T3>Response</T3>_The conditions under which the Secretary can cancel alease are addressed in andSection; 282.15 which repeats the provisions ofthe OCSLA.<T3>Comment</T3>_The MMS should recognize the important economic and strategicpotential of the east coast offshore heavy mineral deposits for supplyingthe U.S. titanium dioxide and titanium metals industries. Regulations shouldbe structured so as to encourage, not discourage, exploration and developmentof titanium deposits.<T3>Response</T3>_The MMS recognizes there is as yet no adequate substitutefor titanium in aircraft, space, and missile applications and no cost-effectivesubstitute for titanium dioxide pigment. The requirements of this proposedrule are designed to encourage the discovery, delineation, and productionof minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur in a manner that balancesthe national need for strategic minerals with appropriate protection ofthe environment.<T3>Comment</T3>_The comment was made that regulations should specify theuse of mining methods that will best serve to protect the marine environment.Another commenter suggested that regulations should be based on controllingimpacts on the environment, rather than on specific methods. A third commenterproposed that state-of-the-art mining technology should be required tominimize environmental damage (e.g., the use of silt curtains during dredgingto restrict the turbidity plume).<T3>Response</T3>_Section 21(b) of the OCSLA requires the use of BAST inoperations for all minerals in the OCS. Appropriate mitigation measureswill be required whenever a proposed mining activity is expected to havean adverse impact on the environment. Requried mitigation measures willnormally be identified during the technical and environmental evaluationsof a lessee's proposed plan. It will be the lessee's responsibility todemonstrate that the activities proposed in its delineation, testing, ormining plan constitute BAST. The plan will describe in detail the activitiesproposed by the lessee as well as any alternative sites and technologiesconsidered by the lessee and why they were not chosen. A proposed planwould not be approved if the technical and environmental evaluations byMMS indicate that the plan does not constitute BAST and that there areunsafe conditions or an undue threat of serious harm or damage to the marine,coastal, or human environment. The MMS does not intend to specify the miningpractices and procedures to be used; however, it would not approve theuse of unsafe practices. It is the lessee's responsibility to assure thatthe methods used are appropriate to the operations being conducted takinginto account the need for safety, environmental protection, and resourceconservation.<T3>Comment</T3>_A commenter stated that proposed production methods shouldbe compatible with geologic conditions.<T3>Response</T3>_The technical and environmental evaluations of a proposedmining plan should determine if the mining method proposed constitutesBAST and is suitable for the geologic environment. If it is determinedthat the plan doesn't represent BAST or that the proposed activities arenot compatible with geologic conditions, the plan would not be approved.<T3>Comment</T3>_A commenter suggested that conservation of resources forthe future should be of little concern.<T3>Response</T3>_The MMS does not share this view. It is important toconserve the Nation's mineral resources and to avoid waste. Delineation,testing, and mining plans will be evaluated to ensure against wastefulpractices and to assure the taking of reasonable actions for the conservationof resources whether leased or unleased.<T3>Comment</T3>_Proposed changes to the sea floor should be describedindicating anticipated extent and depth of excavation.<T3>Response</T3>_The plan should contain a detailed description of proposedexcavation activities which would include the extent and depth of all suchactivities. Actual excavation activities will be governed by the approvedplan. A significant departure from the excavation activities describedin an approved plan must be approved before the change is implemented.<T3>Comment</T3>_Federal regulations should allow for the control of onshoreenvironmental impacts to be handled by the appropriate State agencies.<T3>Response</T3>_The environmental impacts of onshore activities willbe subject to applicable Federal and State requirements. Onshore processingfacilities for minerals mined from the OCS are under the jurisdiction andcontrol of State and local governments and other Federal Agencies. Theproposed rule has no specific application to onshore processing facilitiesother than to require that they be described in a proposed plan togetherwith their socioeconomic implications.<T3>Comment</T3>_Health and safety considerations in the onshore miningindustry are controlled by the Mine Safety and Health Administration andthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration.<T3>Response</T3>_Health and safety considerations in the OCS mining activitieswill continue to be the subject of the regulations of the Federal Agenciesdelegated the authority and responsibility for regulation of those activities.<T3>Comment</T3>_States should have only an advisory role in regulatingmining in the OCS.<T3>Response</T3>_While MMS is committed to early and close coordinationand consultation with States on OCS mineral development, OSC propecting,discovery, delineation, development, and production activities are physicallylocated outside the jurisdiction of any State; therefore, these are areaswhere States have an advisory role. Part of MMS's plan for exercising itsjurisdiction and responsibility for OCS mineral resources is to provideadjacent States opportunities for participation in decisionmaking throughoutthe process from prelease planning to lease abandonment. In the absenceof regulations, consultation and coordination with States concerning prospecting,leasing, and mining of OCS minerals have primarily been accomplished throughjoint State/Federal task forces established by the MMS and the Governorsof adjacent States. A special work group with Alaska and five task forceshave been established to date. Provision is made for the establishmentof additional task forces in andSection; 281.13 of the proposed leasing rules.The activities of each task force will depend on the areas and mineralsinvolved and the particular concerns of the States that are representedon the task force. The proposed leasing rules provide a list of potentialareas of activity for task forces, but it is not intended as an all-inclusivelist. Postlease activities could include review of plans, environmentalmonitoring, and compliance inspections.When a mineral deposit straddles the boundary between Federal and Statejurisdiction, DOI expects to develop agreements with an adjacent Statefor joint management. These agreements would facilitate coordination andcooperation between MMS, agencies of the adjacent State, and State andFederal lessees in order to maximize efficiency, reduce regulatory burden,and obtain the most equitable return to all parties.Proposed andSection; 282.8 also anticipates agreements between the Secretaryand a Governor for operations when there are jurisdictional controversies,in accordance with section 7 of the OCSLA.<T3>Comment</T3>_Applications for mining operations as well as any updatereports should be handled by a single Agency.<T3>Response</T3>_The MMS will approve or disapprove a proposed delineation,testing, and mining plan after consultations with adjacent States and otherFederal Agencies, as appropriate. Discharges of pollutants associated withapproved mining activities which are subject to EPA's NPDES permits willbe subject to EPA approved discharge permits. Also, OCS installations andstructures will be subject to the navigational-aids requirements of theUSCG.<T3>Comment</T3>_Mining plans should provide sufficient detail on mine-siteconditions to allow reasonable review.<T3>Response</T3>_Under the proposed rule, the lessee must provide sufficientdata and information to permit technical and environmental evaluationswhich will provide a basis for MMS to make an informed decision to approve,disapprove, or require modification of the proposed activities.<T3>Comment</T3>_Minimum royalty should be required.<T3>Response</T3>_Provision is made for minimum royalty in the proposedleasing regulations in proposed 30 CFR Part 281.<T3>Comment</T3>_Not every applicant should be required to prepare a detailedenvironmental study on the broad environmental and economic issues.<T3>Response</T3>_Applicants under the proposed rule are required to addresssite-specific issues relating to a lessee's proposed operations and theimpacts of those operations. The proposed activities and potential environmentalimpacts will be evaluated in environmental evaluations prepared in associationwith MMS's technical and environmental evaluation of the applicant's proposal.Broad environmental and economic issues will be addressed in environmentaldocuments prepared in association with the OCS mineral lease sales.<T3>Comment</T3>_Site-by-site approval of postlease operations whetheror not it includes drilling should not be required.<T3>Response</T3>_Under the proposed rule, sampling techniques, samplesize, and proposed sampling locations would be specified in the delineation,testing, and mining plans submitted for MMS review and approval. Approvalof the plan would constitute approval of the sampling techniques, samplesize, and sampling locations. Departures from an approved plan must besubmitted for approval prior to implementing changes from the approvedplan.<T3>Comment</T3>_The type of diligence rule that protects oil, gas, andsulphur lessees from drainage by production on other properties shouldnot be included in the postlease regulations.<T3>Response</T3>_The diligence rules governing OCS oil and gas leasesare designed to protect the lessor from loss, not the lessee. The diligencerequirements of the proposed rule recognize that OCS minerals other thanoil, gas, and sulphur generally do not migrate. Provisions to encouragedevelopment are addressed in proposed leasing regulations.<T3>Comment</T3>_After approval of the mining plan, lessees should be ableto mine the minerals in the most economic way (i.e., not be restrictedby ``high grading'' rules).<T3>Response</T3>_It is anticipated that each proposed mining plan willrepresent the lessee's view of the most economic way for it to mine theOCS minerals involved. Once a mining plan is approved, the lessee mustcomply with that plan unless and until a revision is approved. Proposedleasing regulations at 30 CFR Part 281 permit the Secretary to exercisediscretion to adjust royalty rates or rentals in order to prevent prematureabandonment of mining operations. However, these considerations have tobe balanced with concern for the conservation of OCS natural resourcesand the prevention of waste.<T3>Comment</T3>_Concerning abandonment of operations, commenters statedthat the mining industry should not be saddled with open-ended liabilities.<T3>Response</T3>_Provisions for the abandonment of operations and clearanceof the lease where appropriate will be required for delineation, testing,and mining plans submitted for approval by MMS. The mining industry canprotect itself from subsequent liabilities by planning for and carryingout proper cleanup and abandonment operations.<T3>Comment_</T3>Regulations should provide environmental protection bothoffshore and onshore for all phases of postlease activities.<T3>Response_</T3>The technical and environmental evaluations of any proposedactivity will include consideration of measures to mitigate damage to theenvironment. While onshore activities are outside MMS's jurisdiction andsubject to the regulations of other Federal Agencies as well as State andlocal agencies, potential onshore environmental effects and mitigationmeasures will be addressed in the environmental evaluation of the proposal.<T3>Comment_</T3>A commenter suggests that regulations for prelease, leasing,and postlease operations be combined.<T3>Response_</T3>This suggestion was not adopted. Three separate setsof regulations are being prepared and are being promulgated in separaterulemakings. Each set of regulations covers a significantly different activitywithin a different timeframe. However, they are complementary and willbe published sequentially in Chapter II of Title 30 of the Code of FederalRegulations (CFR), following the existing rules for oil, gas, and sulphur,to comprise a comprehensive set of rules reflective of MMS's authorityand responsibility for administration of all OCS mineral activity underthe OCSLA.<T3>Comment_</T3>Are enough data available to assume that minimal environmentalimpacts would occur in deep waters?<T3>Response_</T3>The MMS's ESP has developed considerable data and informationabout the OCS mining activities and their probable impacts. Under MMS'scase-by-case approach, mitigation measures will be defined with specificityas mineral resource targets are identified and specific recovery methodsare proposed. This proposed rule and the companion rules for prospectiveand leasing will enable MMS to effectively address site-specific environmentalissues concerning specific commodities, technologies, and locations asthe specific issues are defined. To ensure environmental protection whendata are insufficient or unavailable, those activities which are authorizedwill be monitored to ensure the early detection of adverse impacts andthe identification and implementation of effective mitigation measuresto avoid or minimize adverse effects.<T3>Comment_</T3>Postlease regulations should include program participationby States and other Federal Agencies.<T3>Response_</T3>The proposed rule provides several opportunities forparticipation by representatives of State and Federal Agencies. The case-by-caseapproach to leasing provides for management flexibility, opportunity foreffective coastal State and Federal Agency participation, and extensiveenvironmental review. The proposed leasing regulations provide for State/Federaltask forces, and the NEPA process requires Federal inter-Agency consultationand coordination. Review of leasing proposals and of delineation, testing,and mining plans will further facilitate the consultation and coordinationprocesses authorized under other Federal laws.<T3>Comment_</T3>A programmatic EIS should be prepared for the proposedmining program.<T3>Response_</T3>The MMS recognizes the potential for environmental impactsas a result of OCS mineral activities. The MMS has prepared a report, ``EnvironmentalEffects Overview: Marine Mining on the Outer Continental Shelf,'' OCS ReportNo. 87-0035, to provide the public with an early overview of the likelymining activities and potential impacts on the environment resulting fromprospecting and postlease activities. Detailed coverage of potential environmentalissues is not practicable now since many uncertainties remain at this earlystage with respect to the nature, magnitude, location, and rate of futuremining. Many types of ore deposits may be mined in a variety of environmentalsettings using any one of a diverse set of technologies. This rasies questionswhether a meaningful assessment can be conducted at this time. However,sufficient environmental safeguards are being included in these proposedrules to ensure that environmental evaluations will be prepared prior toapproval of a plan of proposed operations. Possible impacts will be identifiedand appropriate mitigation measures determined as part of the DOI's environmentalreview process. Mitigation measures will be defined in lease and operatingrequirements. Commodity- and area-specific issues will be addressed byspecially designed lease stipulations, and site- and operation-specificissues identified after the issuance of a lease will be addressed as conditionsof approval for delineation, testing, and mining plans.<T3>Comment_</T3>Two commenters suggested that DOI support the introductionof new legislation to govern the mining of minerals other than oil, gas,and sulphur since the OCSLA does not provide a clear legal basis for thepromulgation of regulations.<T3>Response_</T3>The MMS does not agree that new legislation is requiredto provide a clear legal basis for the promulgation of regulations to governthe mining of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur. As previouslynoted, section 8(k) of the OCSLA specifically and clearly authorizes theSecretary to prescribe terms and conditions for leasing of OCS mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur. Used in conjunction with other applicablesections of the OCSLA and other laws, this authority provides DOI witha clear legal basis for administering an OCS minerals mining program.<T3>Comment_</T3>Several commenters recommended that regulations shouldprovide for joint/Federal management of mineral resources and postleaseoperations including inspections.<T3>Response_</T3>The MMS has primary authority and responsibility forthe management of OCS mineral resources including postlease activities.The level of participation by adjacent States will vary from State to State.Where the boundary between the State and Federal jurisdictions is underdispute, leasing and postlease activities will be subject to joint approvalsby the responsible Federal and State agencies pursuant to an interim agreementnegotiated in accordance with andSection; 282.8. It is anticipated that thelevel of participation for a specific adjacent State will be dictated bythe degree to which the Governor of that State wants to participate andmutually acceptable conditions can be established. While the final ruledoes not discuss contracting with States, when such contracting is permissibleunder Federal law, it can be considered on a case-by-base basis for suchactivities as compliance inspections.<T3>Comment_</T3>Several commenters expressed concern about environmentalprotection of fishery resources.<T3>Response_</T3>Under the proposed rule, postlease activities will besubject to technical and environmental evaluations. To avoid or minimizeadverse effects, mitigation measures can be included as conditions of approval,or a lessee may be required to modify the planned activities to ensurethat those activities are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner.Necessary mitigation measures can be included as lease stipulations. Sensitiveareas, where special protection is needed, can and will be withheld fromleasing when appropriate.<T3>Comment_</T3>Agencies should have a well-defined time limit for reviewand approval of plans.<T3>Response_</T3>The proposed rule includes specific timeframes for reviewof delineation, testing, and mining plans. Those timeframes are applicableto instances involving minimal disruption of the environment. In thoseinstances where an EIS is prepared in accordance with the practices andprocedures prescribed by NEPA, those timeframes will be lengthened.<T3>Comment_</T3>Several comments were received suggesting that postleaseoperating plans should be required.  <T3>Response_</T3>The proposed rule requires that postlease activitiesbe conducted in accordance with an approved delineation, testing, and/ormining plan.  <T3>Comment_</T3>One commenter urged that hearings on the proposed rulemakingbe held locally to allow public participation.  <T3>Response_</T3>The decision to hold public hearings on the proposedrule has not been made at this time. Three public hearings were held onthe proposed prospecting rules in June 1987. If public hearings are tobe held during the comment period of this proposed rule, it will be announcedin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>  <T3>Comment_</T3>Public interest groups; industry; and local, State, andFederal Agencies should be involved in the initial stages of regulationdevelopment.  <T3>Response_</T3>Meetings were held on March 7, 8, 9, 14, and 28, 1988,to receive comments and recommendations from various parties includingrepresentatives of industry, States, special interest groups, other FederalAgencies, and congressional staffs on a draft of this and the proposedleasing rules. Some of the comments were incorporated into the proposedrules.  <T3>Comment_</T3>To avoid military operational impacts, future mineralleasing programs should be handled in the same manner as the Gorda Ridgeand Hawaii projects.  <T3>Response_</T3>In accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement datedJuly 20, 1983, that covers all mineral activities in the OCS, the MMS willconsult with the various elements of the Department of Defense to avoidor minimize the impact of military operations on OCS mining activitiesand to minimize interference of OCS mining activities on military activitiesin the OCS.  <T3>Comment_</T3>Strong concerns were expressed that the mining of constructionmaterials, placers, and phosphorite desposits could result in significantadverse environmental impacts, particularly in the marine biological community. <T3>Response_</T3>The MMS recognizes the potential for adverse environmentalimpacts. Those impacts will be identified together with appropriate mitigationmeasures during the environmental evaluation of proposed activities. Someareas of the OCS may be found to be of such exceptional natural resourcevalue that the advantages of maintaining those values outweigh the advantagesof leasing the area.  <T3>Comment_</T3>One commenter recommended finding a means of financialassistance for affected States, so that they can function as full partnersin the process, and as an incentive for locating onshore staging areasalong their coasts.  <T3>Response_</T3>The finding of a means to provide financial assistanceto adjacent States is outside the scope of this proposed rule. However,MMS intends to continue joint State/Federal cooperative activities includingfinancial support for joint task forces and studies conducted through jointefforts.  <T3>Comment_</T3>One commenter recommended new legislation to provide formethods other than cash bonus bidding and for revenue sharing.  <T3>Response_</T3>If new legislation is enacted which provides for methodsother than cash bonus bidding or for revenue sharing, revisions will bemade in the regulations to effect required changes.  <T3>Comment_</T3>Vessels involved in postlease operations must comply withUSCG regulations including workplace safety and health. Postlease vesselowners/operators must be aware of USCG accident-reporting requirements.Navigational safety and proper abandonment of operations must be conductedto satisfy USCG requirements.  <T3>Response_</T3>Vessel operators are presumed to be aware of the broadjurisdiction that USCG exercises over vessels operating in U.S. watersincluding the OCS. Lessees will be reminded that MMS approvals for proposedactivities are conditional upon compliance with USCG and other governmentalrequirements for those activities which are not subject to MMS's authority. <T3>Comment_</T3>A commenter suggested that OCS minerals production operationscould be authorized by the same Corps of Engineers nationwide permit usedfor oil and gas explorations, production, and transportation.  <T3>Response_</T3>The applicability of the aforementioned COE nationwidepermit to prelease and postlease mining activities associated with mineralsother than oil, gas, and sulphur must be verified by the lessee with theCOE office having jurisdiction over the area where proposed activity isto be carried out. <T3>Comment</T3>_It was recommended that ocean disposal sites for dredgedmaterial be regulated by EPA and a specification for the sites be includedin the postlease regulations.<T3>Response</T3>_Ocean disposal associated with exploration, testing,and mining activities under an OCS mineral lease may be subject to EPAregulations. Over 125 ocean disposal areas have been designated by EPAfor use as dredged material disposal sites. Disposal activities at eachof these sites are regulated by the COE. It is conceivable that some ofthese sites could also contain subsurface deposits of economically recoverablemarine minerals. However, there is no indication that any of these areaswould be used as disposal areas for mining wastes.<T3>Authors:</T3> Andrew Bailey (retired), Charles Ham, John Mirabella,Jane Roberts, and William Wolf of the MMS; Michael Cruickshank of the USGS(retired); Ransom Read of the BOM; Ronald Smith and Donal Ziehl of theBLM; John Padan of NOAA, Department of Commerce; and Joseph Wilson of COE,U.S. Army.The DOI has determined that this action does not constitute a major Federalaction affecting the quality of the human environment; therefore, an EISis not required.The DOI has also determined that this document is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 because the annual economic effect is less than $100million. The overall effect is expected to be less than $1,000,000 peryear. The costs are based on an expected two sales per year with threenew leases per sale for a total of six new leases per year. When the programis mature, it is anticipated that there will be 10 preproduction leasesand 10 leases in production.The information collection requirements contained in 30 CFR Part 282 havebeen submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approvalunder 44 U.S.C. 3507.
