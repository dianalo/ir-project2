The executive provided no numbers but said the first quarter would be somewhat disappointing while there would be gradual improvement in the second, third and fourth quarters. The company is a diversified maker of aircraft engines.    United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., had 1986 net income of $72.7 million, or 27 cents a share, including a profit of $24.6 million from discontinued operations. The annual profit included a fourth-quarter loss of $228 million that reflected provisions for restructuring and work-force reductions.    Profit in the 1986 first quarter was $127.6 million, or 93 cents a share.    Mr. Daniell told securities analysts the pattern of increasing earnings was tied to the restructuring, in which several thousand employees are being cut, and that the savings will become increasingly apparent as 1987 progresses.    He also said the Hamilton Standard division, which produces military electronics equipment, had a &quot;considerable loss&quot; in 1986. It will be in the midst of a turnaround in 1987, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
