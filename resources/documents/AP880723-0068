The trip, Ball's first to the region as the Navy's top civilianofficial, was not announced in advance by the Pentagon and wassurrounded by special security precautions, including abullet-proof car.   Ball arrived in the gulf Friday. U.S. officials, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said the visit had been planned for sometime and was unrelated either to plans for reducing U.S. forces inthe region or the investigation into the shooting down of anIranian jetliner by a Navy warship July 3.   Meanwhile, two U.S. warships weighed anchor and left Manama,bound for home after completing their three-month tours of duty inthe Persian Gulf.   Naval sources said the departure of the destroyer O'Brien andthe missile frigate John H. Sides was part of a normal rotation anddid not signal the start of a U.S. force reduction connected withan Iran-Iraq cease-fire.   Both ships are being replaced by other vessels now en route tothe region, keeping the force in and around the Persian Gulf at 27.   U.S. officials say the fleet is certain to be cut back if aU.N.-sponsored truce between Iran and Iraq goes into effect, butthat any speculation on a timetable is premature.</TEXT></DOC>
