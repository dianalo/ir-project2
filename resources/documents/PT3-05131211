The bottom wall of the circular      recess is provided with spaced holes through which a vacuum is drawn to      advance the leads into this recess in the packaging process. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  The present invention pertains to the packaging of components such as fiber      optic devices which have elongate, flexible leads and, more particularly,      to packaging arrangements in which such leads are efficiently placed and      retained in an orderly array. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A number of electronic and fiber optic components include a body portion      and elongate, flexible leads extending therefrom. In the packaging of such      components it is necessary to contain the leads in an orderly manner to      prevent damage to the leads. Fiber optic leads, in particular, must be      packaged in a way which avoids the formation of sharp bends or kinks in      the leads and which avoids tangling of the leads. Manual packaging of such      components, while potentially effective in preventing damage to the      component leads, is an added expense. </PAR><PAR>  The requirement that the component leads be arranged without sharp bends or      kinks necessitates the use of a relatively large size container,      particularly when the leads are of substantial length. This, again,      represents an expense, both in terms of packaging material and in space      requirements in storage and shipping of the packaged components. </PAR><PAR>  It is a primary object of the present invention to provide for the      packaging of components having elongate, flexible leads in a manner which      maintains the leads in an orderly and undamaged configuration. </PAR><PAR>  It is also an object of the present invention to provide packaging for such      components which utilizes a relatively compact container. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the invention is the provision of such packaging which      permits the use of automated packaging techniques. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The above and other objects of the invention which will become apparent      hereinafter are achieved by the provision of a container for packaging a      fiber optic or other component of the type having a body portion and      elongate, flexible leads extending therefrom which container is of molded      plastic construction and includes cover and base panels connected by an      integral hinge, the base panel having a first recess for retaining the      body portion of the component, a second, annular recess adjacent the first      recess for receiving the component leads, and third recesses      interconnecting the first and second recesses along smoothly curving      paths. The bottom wall of the annular recess is provided with spaced holes      which are brought sequentially into communication with a vacuum source to      draw the free ends of the leads into the annular recess, thereby coiling      the leads around the inner wall of this recess. First and second annular      flanges secured adjacent the radially outer and inner sides of the annular      recess, respectively, together form a cover therefor. </PAR><PAR>  For a more complete understanding of the invention and the objects and      advantages thereof, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings      and the following detailed description wherein a preferred embodiment of      the invention is illustrated and described. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In the drawings: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a fiber optic component; </PAR><PA1>  FIG. 2 is a plan view of the container of the present invention; </PA1><PA1>  FIGS. 3 and 4 are transverse cross sectional views taken on the lines 3--3      and 4--4, respectively, of FIG. 2; </PA1><PAR>  FIGS. 5 and 6 are fragmentary transverse cross sectional views taken on the      lines 5--5 and 6--6, respectively, of FIG. 2; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 7, 8 and 9 are schematic showing of the sequence of steps performed      in packaging of a component in the container of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  A typical fiber optic component 10 includes, as is shown in FIG. 1, a body      portion 12 in which are housed the active elements of the component and a      plurality of elongate, flexible leads 14 and 16 extending from he body      portion for connection with other components and circuits. As has been      mentioned above, these leads, which are filaments of glass or other light      conducting material, are relatively fragile and subject to damage if      kinked or otherwise roughly handled. </PAR><PAR>  The container of the present invention used in packaging the fiber optic      component, or a similar electronic component, is illustrated in FIG. 2      through 6. The package is, preferrably, of vacuum thermoformed plastic      construction and includes a base panel 20 and a lid panel 22 which are      joined by an integral hinge 24. An upwardly projecting ridge 26 extends      along the three sides of the base panel remote from the hinge with a      complementary groove 28 being provided in the lid panel, the ridge and      groove forming a friction fit closure for the package. </PAR><PAR>  A first recess 30 in the base panel is configured to receive the body      portion 12 of the fiber optic device, the length and width of the recess      being substantially equal to those of the device so as to provide a snap      fit retaining the device therein with the depth of the recess from the      principal surface 32 of the base panel being approximately equal to the      thickness of the device. One or more second recesses 34 extend outwardly      from opposite sides of the recess 30 at locations corresponding to the      points at which the leads 14, 16 exit from the device body portion 12 and      are of sufficient depth as to receive the leads. Adjacent to the first      recess is a third, circular recess 36 the bottom wall 38 of which is      provided with holes 40 uniformly spaced therearound. The depth of the      recess 36 is greater than that of the first recess and the arcuate bottom      wall 38 is of sufficient flexibility as to allow upward movement of the      inner wall 42 of the recess 36. Concentrically surrounding the circular      recess 36 is a fourth, also circular recess 44 spaced radially outwardly      therefrom so as to provide a circular, upwardly projecting ridge 46 at the      circumference of the recess 36. The recess 44 and ridge 46 serve to locate      and retain a ring 48 having outer and inner flanges 50 an 52,      respectively, joined by a midportion 54 of complementary configuration to      the ridge 46, the outer flange 50 being received in the recess 44 and the      inner flange 52 overlying the radially outward half of the circular recess      36. A circular plate 56 is attached to the central wall portion 58 defined      by the recess 36, the plate being concentric with the recess 36 and of      such diameter as to project outwardly, overlying the radially inner half      of the recess 36 thus forming, with the flange 52, a cover for this      recess. The ring 48 and plate 46 are secured to the base panel 22,      preferably being heat sealed thereto. Extensions 60 of the second, lead      receiving recesses 34 connect these recesses to the circular recess 36      along smoothly curving paths which extend tangentially into the recess 36,      the ridge 46 of the base plate and the midportion 54 of ring 48 being      interrupted, as indicated by the numeral 62, at the juncture of the      extensions 60 and the circular recess 36. </PAR><PAR>  The fiber optic device may be packaged manually or automatically. Manual      packaging involves inserting the component body portion 12 into the first      recess 20, raising the center portion of the base panel to separate the      plate 56 from the flange 52 thus providing access to the inner wall 42 of      the recess 36 and coiling the leads 14 and 16 about this wall. </PAR><PAR>  The sequence of steps in the automated packaging a flexible lead component      in the container of the present invention is shown schematically in FIGS.      7-9. The body portion 12 of the component is first snapped into the recess      30 with the leads 14, 16 extending outwardly through the recesses 34. The      free ends of the first set of leads 14 are then placed at the juncture of      the flange 52 and plate 56 overlying the recess 36 and in alignment with      the recess extensions 60, passing through the gap 62. The container is      positioned on a support surface having a vacuum port 64 with the bottom      surface of the container base panel in contact with the surface and the      vacuum port 64 in communications with the one of the holes 40 adjacent the      entry gap 62. As the base panel 20 is pressed onto the support surface,      the inner wall 42 of the circular recess 36 and the plate 56 move upwardly      by a short distance relative to the remainder of the base panel, creating      an annular opening between the plate 56 and the flange 52. A vacuum is      drawn through the port 64 to draw the free ends of the leads 14 into the      circular recess. By relative rotation of the container relative to the      vacuum port, as indicated by the arrow 66, successive ones of the holes 50      are brought into communication with the vacuum port thus advancing the      leads 14 into the recess 36 and winding them about the inner wall 42. When      the leads 14 have been drawing fully into the recess, as shown in FIG. 9,      the process is repeated with the second set of leads 16, these leads being      wound in the opposite direction about the wall 42. Thereafter, the lid      panel 20 is closed onto the base panel 22, completing the packaging      operation. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention provides for the packaging of flexible lead      components in an efficient and compact manner. The recesses 34 and recess      extensions 60 offer smooth transitions for the leads between the      components body retaining recess 30 and the circular recess 36 in which      the principal lengths of the leads are stored in an orderly fashion. </PAR><PAR>  While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and      described in detail, it will be apparent that changes and additions may be      had therein and thereto without departing for the spirit of the invention.      Reference should, accordingly, be had to the appended claims in      determining the true scope of the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
