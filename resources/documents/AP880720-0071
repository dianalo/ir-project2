PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A school official charged with lewdbehavior killed himself after making a videotape proclaiming hisinnocence, not knowing that his 15-year-old accuser had recantedher story two days earlier.   ``I think that somebody somewhere along the line could have toldsomebody that the story had been altered,'' the girl's mother toldthe St. Petersburg Times in Tuesday's editions.   Douglas Tarrant, 41, Pinellas County assistant schoolsuperintendent for finance, died Friday in his car of carbonmonoxide poisoning. He was arrested July 11 on a charge ofcommitting a lewd and lascivious act.   The 15-year-old told police that Tarrant asked her to get intohis car and was masturbating. But under questioning July 13, thegirl said Tarrant did nothing more than ask her to get into hiscar, according to her mother.   The mother called police and school officials to tell them herdaughter had recanted the sexual allegation, and the teen-ager wasasked to give a sworn statement to state prosecutors. The sessionwas scheduled for July 25.   ``It's too late now. I did everything I knew to do,'' the mothersaid after Tarrant's death.   Tarrant's family said he was depressed over a serious healthproblem and that his arrest was more than he could handle.   He had worked for the school district since 1971 and was afinance official for the past two years. He had been on medicalleave since June because of a serious heart condition that promptedtwo heart attacks.   Tarrant's brother Jeff said the girl's mother called him Mondayto tell him what had happened.   ``She was very upset,'' he said. ``I'm just too shocked over thewhole thing.''   Detective James Dressback said the mother called SchoolSuperintendent Scott Rose on Thursday and he referred her to SteveCrosby, personnel director, who was investigating the accusation.   Crosby said he talked to the mother Friday morning, then calledTarrant but didn't mention the mother's call because he was unsurewhich story was correct.   ``I told him that we wanted to straighten out the girl's storyand whether she was being truthful,'' Crosby said. ``I told himthere was some confusion. I told him we would request of her motherthat she take a polygraph exam.   ``He said thanks for the consideration. Then he discussedmeeting with his attorney, and I gave him my home phone number andasked him to give me a call after he met with his attorney.   ``When somebody's talking to you about meeting with his attorneyon Monday,'' Crosby said, ``you just don't think that he might beconsidering committing suicide.''</TEXT></DOC>
