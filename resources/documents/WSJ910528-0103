Mr. Woolard said the fibers division, which accounted for$6 billion of the company's $40 billion in sales last year,is &quot;sometimes a leading indicator&quot; for the rest of Du Pont.</LP><TEXT>   As for a sales recovery at other divisions, &quot;we don't seeit anywhere else&quot; yet within the company, he said. While heand other Du Pont executives said they believe the recessionin the U.S. has bottomed out, Mr. Woolard added, &quot;there areno multiple signs that the recession is over,&quot; based on salesresults from Du Pont's different units.   Theodore Semegran, a securities analyst with ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. in New York, said he recommended Du Pontstock for purchase earlier this month, partly on the strengthin the fibers division. He said that Du Pont's Aprilshipments, including exports, of nylon and polyester yarn andstaple to industrial users were 15% to 20% higher than inMarch in many cases, although most segments still laggedyear-ago levels.   Mr. Woolard said it is still too early to project how DuPont will fare financially in the current quarter, addingthat it is company policy not to comment on specific earningsprojections. Noting that in the first quarter the companynearly matched year-earlier earnings per share, reporting 88cents a share compared with 90 cents a share in 1990's firstquarter, he added, &quot;we don't see a major short fall&quot; thisyear compared with last year.   He said the company's mix of businesses, includingchemicals, fibers, plastics, petroleum, coal and a grab bagof diversified businesses, plus its strong presence inEurope, where most economies are stronger than in the U.S.,&quot;will allow us to have a decent year.&quot;   In March, Du Pont agreed to sell a 50% stake in itsConsolidation Coal Co. subsidiary to the German coal companyRheinbraun A.G., a unit of RWE A.G. Terms weren't disclosed,but analysts have estimated the sale price at $1 billion to$1.25 billion. The sale is expected to be completed by yearend.   Some Wall Street analysts estimate the company will earnroughly 80 cents to 90 cents a share for the current quarter,compared with $1.02 a year ago. Of 18 securities analystsfollowing the company, the mean earnings estimate for 1991 is$3.06 a share, and $3.55 a share for 1992, compared with$3.40 a share last year, according to Zacks InvestmentResearch. The estimates don't include any anticipated gainfrom the sale of the coal interest.   Mr. Woolard said the company expects the economy to beginrebounding sometime this year, &quot;but we don't expect a robustrecovery.&quot;   Du Pont's fibers unit incorporates mature, high volumebusinesses such as nylon and Dacron polyester, which areclosely linked to the U.S. economy with heavy sales to thetextile and housing markets. Faster growing specialtyproducts range from Lycra spandex to flame retardant Nomexand Kevlar, a high strength fiber used in tires, bullet-proofvests and U.S. Army infantry helmets.   Another bright spot, albeit a relatively small one in DuPont's constellation of multibillion businesses, is its jointventure in pharmaceuticals with Merck andamp; Co. The joint ventureposts about $700 million in annual sales and will be&quot;modestly&quot; profitable in its first full year of business, Mr.Woolard said. Pharmaceuticals had been losing about $50million a year in recent years when operating as a Du Pontunit, he said.   The company decided it needed to link up with drug giantMerck in pharmaceuticals in order to have the resources andexpertise to be a global player in what is expected to be arapidly growing market, he said.   Mr. Woolard noted that while Du Pont's chemical andplastics businesses were benefiting from declining rawmaterial prices during the recession, the prices Du Pont hasbeen able to charge for its finished products also are comingdown.   Du Pont's petroleum business, acquired 10 years ago whenthe company bought Conoco, is benefiting from continuedstrength in refining margins, despite the slowdown in theU.S. economy, Mr. Woolard said. The petroleum business,buoyed by the jump in oil prices last year following Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait, accounted for $16 billion out of thecompany's $40 billion in 1990 sales, and $1.1 billion out of$2.3 billion in net income.</TEXT></DOC>
