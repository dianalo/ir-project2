Characterization techniques suchas electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy,nuclear magnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopies, thermal analysis,acid dissolution, silanation, and density fractionation have been usedas experimental probes, and reveal a range of information relating tothe glass phases from the macro, through the micro, to the nano-structurallevels. Complex inter- and intra-particle heterogeneity in ash is observablenot only in bulk chemical and mineralogical analyses but also at themolecular level in the constituent glasses. Remarkable relationshipsbetween ash particle size, density and glass composition have been observedand lead to a new proposed mechanism for ash morphogenesis based on temperature-viscosityeffects in the mineral precursor melts in the boiler flame. A glass-ceramicmodel for fly ash particle structure is proposed and discussed in termsof phase relations in the CaO-SiO/sub 2/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and FeO .Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/-SiO/sub 2/ systems, modificationsof the aluminosilicate glasses by alkali and alkaline earth metal cationsand microheterogeneity involving glass devitrification and phase separation.</TEXT></DOC>
