Exxon is sitting home dateless on Saturdaynight. And General Electric and IBM have fewer admirers thanthey used to.   Those are some of the conclusions that can be drawn from arecent poll by Rivel Research Group in Westport, Conn. Over a2 1/2-month period through Feb. 25, Rivel polled 200 moneymanagers, asking which three or four stocks they thoughtwould perform best in the next 12 months.</LP><TEXT>   Managers could choose any stock, no matter how tiny. Butthe major vote getters, as the table shows, were big,wellknown companies such as Philip Morris and Merck. For themost part, as one might expect, managers voted for stocksthey already own.   What's interesting are the exceptions. They can be foundby comparing the Rivel poll results against a list of biginstitutional holdings compiled by CDA InvestmentTechnologies, Rockville, Md. CDA tracks managers' portfoliosthrough the 13F forms that large managers must file with theSecurities and Exchange Commission. (Managers with more than$100 million in stock must file 13F forms; some smallermanagers file them voluntarily.)   According to CDA, 684 managers owned more than $27 billionof Exxon stock as of Sept. 30, the latest data available. Buthow many votes did Exxon get in the poll? Not one.   Wolodymyr Wronskyj, manager of Dreyfus Fund, speaks for alot of managers when he describes why he's unenthusiasticabout Exxon, which sells for about 12 times the company'spast four quarters' earnings and yields 4.8% a year individends. &quot;The outlook for oil is not favorable,&quot; he says.&quot;We're still in a recession, and oil is plentiful. This iswhat the war was all about in Kuwait -- to keep the price ofoil low and the supply plentiful.&quot;   Scott Black, president of Delphi Management in Boston,thinks more highly of Exxon, but not highly enough to own it.&quot;People are worried about the price of oil,&quot; he says. As aresult, the energy sector is one of the few pockets in thestock market that is &quot;statistically cheap.&quot; Exxon, he says,is &quot;the best of the American internationals&quot; in the oilbusiness but he prefers Royal Dutch Shell Group, which hethinks has done a better job of exploration lately.   International Business Machines fared a little better inthe poll. It was named by seven managers out of 200. That'snot very many, considering that 731 managers who filed 13Fforms indicated they had IBM in their portfolios.   &quot;I have no respect for IBM,&quot; says Mr. Black. &quot;Here's acompany that had about 80% of the world market&quot; forcomputers. &quot;But like Napoleon surrounded by Wellington atWaterloo, they let themselves get outflanked. IBM's doneeverything wrong.&quot;   David Elias, chief investment officer at Elias AssetManagement in Buffalo, N.Y., adds: &quot;We would definitely stayaway from IBM. The people in the trenches want to do the job,but they're not getting the direction or the vision&quot; theyneed. &quot;Until (chief executive) John Akers is asked to stepdown, we don't think IBM's going anywhere.&quot;   Big Blue isn't without defenders. Richard L. Evans, whoruns a Flossmoor, Ill., investment firm bearing his name,likes IBM's 5.5% dividend yield and considers the stock&quot;probably the best value&quot; among the 30 in the Dow JonesIndustrial Average. Richard Arms, head of Arms EquivolumeCorp. in Albuquerque, N.M., says IBM shares &quot;seem to havefound a support area&quot; around 83 to 85; he thinks they arelikely to move up to around 125 within a year. IBM closedyesterday at 86 5/8, down 3/4.   Neither Mr. Arms nor Mr. Evans rush to the defense ofGeneral Electric. GE received only seven votes in the Rivelpoll, even though CDA counts 732 money managers who own it,the highest total on its list. (IBM has 731, Philip Morris719.) Mr. Arms, a stock-chart student, says the stock'sinability to pierce the $82 barrier was a bad sign. Mr. Evanssays GE shares have had such a major run-up that furthergains are unlikely for a while. GE hit a low of 62 inDecember; it closed yesterday at 77 3/4, up 1/8.   Investment professionals gush with enthusiasm for PhilipMorris. &quot;I love Philip Morris. I've loved it for 10 years,&quot;says Marvin B. Roffman of Roffman Miller Associates inPhiladelphia. &quot;The company is a huge cash-flow machine.Between 1992 and 1996 it will generate $21 billion in freecash flow&quot; that isn't needed to pay the current $2.10-a-shareannual dividend rate or for capital spending.   Philip Morris is so popular with money managers that onemight question who's left to buy it. But Mr. Roffman says astock's popularity isn't a problem unless the price getspushed excessively high. Philip Morris hasn't been, he says.It sells for 16 times the past four quarters' earnings, and13.4 times the $5.56 a share in earnings that most analystspredict for 1992.   Money managers say Philip Morris would sell at a highermultiple if it weren't for investors' fears that a cigarettemaker may some day lose a product-liability case, opening thefloodgates for further lawsuits. Most pros shrug off suchfears; some buy the stock during periodic &quot;litigationscares.&quot;   Computer-chip maker Intel ranked well in the poll, with 10votes, even though it isn't among the very biggest holdingsof institutions. It ranks 53rd on CDA's list by dollar value,with 404 managers owning $5.9 billion of the stock.   Mr. Wronskyj of Dreyfus Fund says Intel CEO Andrew Grovehas done a &quot;brilliant&quot; job of going beyond a mere componentsbusiness to make Intel's chips the heart of most personalcomputers. However, he says he doesn't own the stock becausehe's a bargain hunter and Intel never dips into his pricerange.   Drew Peck, an analyst for Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette,says he thinks Intel has &quot;reasonably positive&quot; prospects forthe very short term, and for the long term. But he thinks thesecond half of this year will be a &quot;dangerous&quot; time, becausehe expects fierce chip price wars to break out among Intel,Advanced Micro Devices, Chips andamp; Technologies, and perhapsclosely held Cyrix, which is based in Dallas.   Art Rivel, president of the survey research firm thatconducted the poll, says that what struck him most was moneymanagers' strong attraction to health-care companies. Four ofthe top six vote getters -- Merck, Glaxo, Bristol-MyersSquibb, and Eli Lilly -- are pharmaceutical firms. And Amgen,Syntex, Abbott Laboratories and UnitedHealth Care were amongthe top 25.   ---                  Most Likely to Succeed                                                                                                          In a poll, 200 money managers were asked to name three orfour stocks that would &quot;perform the best over the next 12months.&quot; These stocks rang up the most votes.
