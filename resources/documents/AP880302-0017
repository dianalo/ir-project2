Vice President George Bush is taking some heat on theIran-Contra affair from Sen. Bob Dole. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ismoving onto the populist turf claimed thus far by Rep. RichardGephardt. And Gephardt is continuing his broadside againstMassachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.   Gephardt, D-Mo., also is running an ad in which Rep. MarvinLeath of Texas praises him for standing ``with us for lower taxes,for an oil import fee to make America strong, for a tough tradebill to stand up for American workers.'' Leath says Gore andDukakis oppose all three.   Gore spokesman Arlie Schardt said Tuesday it had not beendecided yet whether the Tennessee senator would release his owncache of hard-hitting ads.   ``We're prepared for any needs that may arise,'' Schardt said.``We're considering what other messages we may still want to conveyover the next few days.''   Gore did mount an indirect TV challenge to Gephardt on Tuesday,when he started running three new ads promoting populist themessimilar to the ones Gephardt has adopted.   One new ad depicts Gore as a fighter against polluters,price-fixers and big corporations _ exactly the type ofanti-establishment image Gephardt has tried to cultivate.   The other two ads feature Gore talking to groups of Texas oilworkers. In one spot he says corporations need to invest in Americaand create jobs at home, while in the other he tells the workersthat ``it's time to put people back to work in the United Statesand have the rigs in Libya and Iran stand idle for a change.''   The ``blame foreigners'' message is strikingly similar to one ofGephardt's strongest ads, the ``Hyundai'' spot that helped him winthe Iowa caucuses and is now being used across the Super Tuesdaystates.   In that ad the congressman criticizes South Korea for puttinghigh import tariffs on U.S. autos and asks how many Hyundais theKoreans could sell here at $48,000 apiece.   Gephardt has also revived a highly effective South Dakota spot,now retooled for Super Tuesday, alleging that Dukakis is atax-raiser and mocking his suggestion that depressed Iowa farmersrecover by growing Belgian endive.   The Dukakis campaign was planning to take aim at Gephardt'snewly acquired reputation as an anti-establishment crusader andpossibly run an ad featuring a swirling weathervane to raisequestions about his consistency.   Leslie Dach, Dukakis's communications director, said no finaldecisions had been made about which ads would be used where andwhen.   But he said the general thrust of the spots is that Gephardt``says he is leading the little guy's fight but his campaign isfinanced and supported by the big guys. His biggest contributorsare America's biggest corporations. He has failed to show a set ofprinciples or a set of values that give a rudder to his policies.''   He said Dukakis was also prepared to counter-attack againstGore, if necessary.   Dukakis has commercials on the air in Texas and Florida, thebiggest Super Tuesday states, plus Maryland. His ad campaign was toexpand this week into Washington state, Oklahoma, Arkansas,Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, aides said.   Dole, R-Kan., went on the air Tuesday in North Carolina andSouth Carolina with an ad contrasting his and Bush's positions on anumber of issues, including the Iran-Contra affair.   The narrator says Dole ``opposed selling arms to Iran. Bushsupported the arms-for-hostages deal.'' The ad also accuses Bush ofwaffling on taxes, taking a soft line on the U.S.-Soviet armscontrol treaty, and opposing a textile bill popular in severalSouthern states.   Another Dole spot running in Florida depicts a man walkingthrough snow but leaving no footprints. Dole campaign manager BillBrock said the message is that Bush ``has held all these big jobs''yet left no mark.   The vice president, in West Palm Beach, Fla., called the``footprints'' commercial ``terribly ineffective.''   Bush's campaign refused to disclose any details of how orwhether it planned to respond. But the vice president said: ``We'renot going to sit out there unprotected. ... I think I have everyright to set the record straight.''   Bush used a negative ad against Dole in New Hampshire lastmonth, but it ran for only a couple of days before the primary.   As the Super Tuesday TV campaign grew more heated, Rep. JackKemp, R-N.Y., questioned Pat Robertson's judgment in radio adsthroughout South Carolina, which holds a GOP primary on Saturday.   The Kemp ad asks if the former television evangelist has ``thequalifications and the judgment to be our next president'' andcites some of his more unusual positions such as a 1979 suggestionthat public schools be eliminated. Robertson later changed his mindabout that.   In addition to negative ads, the candidates are using moretraditional biographical spots and political testimonials. Amongthem: former Sen. Barry Goldwater endorses Bush, former HouseSpeaker Thomas P. O'Neill of Massachusetts praises Dukakis, andRep. Claude Pepper _ an elderly Florida legislator with enormousclout among senior citizens _ speaks kindly of Gephardt.   At least two candidates, Gore and Dukakis, are usingSpanish-language ads in Texas. Dukakis does the talking himself.``The governor is fluent in Spanish, so it seemed like the thing todo,'' said Tom Cosgrove, Dukakis's Texas campaign director.   There are 712 Republican delegates and 1,307 Democraticdelegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday, March 8. Television is thecandidates' major tool in seeking to win them.</TEXT></DOC>
