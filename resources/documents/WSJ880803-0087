Hughes (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BVG MKT </IN><TEXT>   The art community is suddenly awash in a sea of free booze.    In a move to combat declining alcohol consumption, a growing number of liquor companies are trying to identify themselves with the upscale, fashionable set that attends art events. They are pouring lots of free drinks, especially champagne and liqueurs, at art events in Los Angeles and New York.    &quot;We are targeting the avant-garde trend setters with the hope that people will look to them for trends and there will be a trickle-down effect,&quot; says Ann Willets, a spokeswoman for Schieffelin andamp; Somerset, a joint venture of Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Guinness PLC. &quot;People used to think of it as a starving artist crowd and it's not. These people have a high disposable income.&quot; Schieffelin has been pouring free Dom Ruinart champagne at art events.    Cointreau America Inc., a unit of Cointreau S.A. in Paris, has served margaritas made with its liqueur at art gallery parties. It believes the free drinks may help it establish brand loyalty among young consumers. &quot;The heaviest drinkers are older, in the 45-plus category, but younger people, 21 to 35, are fairly impressionable,&quot; says Kip Morrison, a publicist.    Plenty of people in the arts community are clamoring to get the free drinks. Carillon Importers, a unit of International Distillers andamp; Vintners in London, says it gets dozens of requests for free Absolut vodka and its other brands every week, mostly from small art groups. Some companies say small art gallery shows offer better exposure than a large museum event. &quot;It's a relatively uncluttered area in terms of sponsors, and it's easier to get attention,&quot; says Ms. Willets at Schieffelin.    A few people in the art world have qualms about liquor tie-ins. &quot;To a certain extent, it's crass commercialism,&quot; says Richard Kuhlenschmidt, an art gallery owner in Santa Monica, Calif. &quot;It's providing free advertising for liquor companies and it sort of cheapens the art opening.&quot; Some companies are doing more than just pouring free drinks. Last March, Schieffelin underwrote a party for the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, a nonprofit art gallery. The company hired a Los Angeles artist to build a bar using 200 empty Tanqueray bottles, and free Tanqueray cocktails were served.    The company even set up an art show and is using photographs of that event in ads for Dom Ruinart champagne. The artists and some Los Angeles gossip columnists also received free cases of the champagne. &quot;We gave it to them so that they would expose their other art and performance circle of friends to the product,&quot; says JoAnn Craner, marketing brand manager at Schieffelin.    Liquor marketers say they typically spend less than $1 million for their giveaways to the art community.    The sales impact of the free drinks is difficult to measure because such promotions can't be separated from other types of advertising. But Schieffelin judges the success of giveaways by whether the product is mentioned in news coverage of art shows and parties.    That's undoubtedly why liquor companies are also giving a lot of free booze to trendy publications that organize art-related events. Carillon has provided free drinks at art gatherings organized by such publications as Details, Paper and N.Y.C. Metro. And Cointreau has supplied free drinks for arts events sponsored by L.A. Style magazine and Detour Magazine in Dallas.    The promotion of liquor brands at art events is usually subtle. When Interview magazine held a dinner party for artists, Carillon served Laurent Perrier champagne in buckets inscribed with the brand name. And Cointreau merely adds its name at the bottom of invitations.    But some promotions aren't so low-key. Carillon has hired well-known painters, such as Keith Haring, to create ads for Absolut vodka. Recently, the company flew a group of those artists to Sweden where they watched as a 20-foot ice replica of an Absolut bottle was lowered from a helicopter. Lumberjacks split the ice bottle open and the group climbed inside.    Says Richard McEvoy, a senior vice president at Carillon, &quot;Art and fashion are a gateway to the top of the social pyramid.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
