A interdisciplinarytechnical group, the contract-review team, should be established, consulted,and perhaps even heeded before a coal-supply contract is negotiated andsigned. Nothing in this document should be construed as being a legalopinion. Certain technical terms in common usage have legal meaningsbeyond that used in every-day use. A lawyer should be an indispensablepart of every contract review team. While all aspects of coal-supplycontracts are technical in nature, beyond generalities, this paper shalladdress primarily the technical aspects pertaining to sampling and analysisof coal supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
