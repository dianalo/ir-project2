Viktor Smirnov, former second-ranking party official in theMoldavian republic, was charged Jan. 11 with taking bribes.   The weekly Moscow News said at the time that Smirnov had beenpopular in Moldavia where he was sent in 1984 because of hisactivity in an investigation that broke up a chain of corruption inthe republic of Uzbekistan.   That investigation was led by Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov,two investigators who tracked a chain of bribery and corruptionthat led to Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former leader LeonidI. Brezhnev.   ``Today, the case against Smirnov was dropped due to the absenceof facts of the crime, and he was released from custody,'' Tasssaid.   It said prosecutors ``apologized to Smirnov for the seriousviolations of socialist legality with regard to him on the part ofofficials from the prosecutor's office.'' It did not identify theofficials responsible for arresting him.   Gdlyan and Ivanov gained wide popularity in the Soviet Unionbecause of their investigation, and both won seats in the Congressof People's Deputies parliament that meets for the first timeThursday.   But Ivanov has been sharply attacked by the Kremlin for sayingin a televised election debate May 12 that the name of Politburomember Yegor K. Ligachev has come up in his corruptioninvestigation. The Soviet Supreme Court has ordered aninvestigation of Gdlyan because of the jailing of a famous Estonianscientist who died in prison and later was cleared of charges.   A commission of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, thecountry's highest executive body, on Friday reported systematicviolations of laws and ethics by Gdlyan and Ivanov, and turnedtheir findings over to the Soviet Procurator General's Office.   Ligachev has denied any wrongdoing and demanded that results ofan investigation be made public. Tass said a statement of his aboutthe corruption investigation was read at Monday's meeting of theparty's policy-making Central Committee. It did not provide details.   Moscow News on Jan. 22 said Smirnov was one of four delegates tothe Communist Party conference in June 1988 that Vitaly Korotich,editor of Ogonyok, identified in a speech as having been implicatedin taking bribes.   If true, that would mean that Smirnov was implicated by Gdlyanand Ivanov, who wrote the article published by Korotich's magazinealleging four unidentified delegates to the conference had takenbribes.   But Ogonyok itself later published the names of four Uzbekofficials that it said had been fired from party jobs or were beingprosecuted as a result of an investigation started after Korotich'sspeech at the party conference.   Smirnov resigned his job in Moldavia in 1988. Tass said fullerinformation about his case would be published later.</TEXT></DOC>
