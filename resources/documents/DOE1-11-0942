The results obtainedby the studies were as follows: (1) High quality technology for amorphoussemiconductor production: An amorphous film growing facility of separateand independent reaction type for tandem structure was completed, andoptimum film forming conditions for every reaction chamber and an optimumprimary step for each mono-layer for the tandem structure were studied.(2) Study on the technology for modular design: Enclosing elements weremade by means of film using fluoro-ethylenepropylene (FEP) as the basematerial, and weather-proof tests are being carried out. (3) Study onthe electrode formation technology: By low temperature film formation- short time annealing, a good result was obtained for the redistributionof impurity and improvement of the processing capacity. (4) Study onreliability technology: A high grade cell with the deterioration rateof the conversion efficiency of less than 2 - 3% was obtained. (4 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
