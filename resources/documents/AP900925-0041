(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The City Council failed to revive thenation's first tax on college tuition but voted to seek other waysof raising extra money from Northwestern University and three othercolleges in this Chicago suburb.   The council, in a 10-8 vote Monday, fell two votes short ofoverriding Mayor Joan Barr's veto of a tuition tax of up to $60 ayear on students at Northwestern, Kendall College, GarrettEvangelical Theological Seminary and Seabury-Western TheologicalSeminary.   ``The people who are opposed are always joined together onanything the city administration wants,'' said Alderman JackKorshak, who proposed the tax.   The tax would have generated an estimated $500,000 a year towardthe city's budget, which totaled $77.3 million in 1990-91,officials said.   The measure, adopted on Sept. 10, centered on Northwestern'sunwillingness to pay the city for police and fire protection. Theuniversity has its own security force but occasionally asks forassistance from Evanston police.   Evanston schools are exempt from property taxes, and the measurewas intende to give tax relief to homeowners who saw higher billsin this community of 73,000 because of reassessment last year.   The council also voted 15-3 Monday to establish a three-membercommittee to look for ways to increase the amount of moneyNorthwestern gives the city.   Northwestern is willing to hold talks with city officials on``all matters of mutual interest to the city, not just a financialcontribution,'' said spokesman Chuck Loebbaka.   Opponents who labeled the tax ``anti-education'' and``anti-business'' said it would destroy the relationship betweenthe city and its educational institutions. Northwestern, which owns242 of the 5,400 acres in the community, has said it is typical forsuch institutions to be exempt from property taxes.   Most of the school's nearly 10,500 students are undergraduateswho pay tuition of $13,725 a year.</TEXT></DOC>
