The disagreement between the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund centers around the division of work between them.Which should be telling governments to devalue their currencies?Which should require cuts in government spending? Which should lookat long-term problems? How long is long-term?   The 151 governments that own the bank and the IMF, which gettogether every spring and fall, start meetings in the coming week.Their ministers of finance and central bankers will have a lot tosay about the debt of Third World countries, now over $1.2trillion. What the two organizations can do about it depends onclearing up just what their roles should be, or even whether theyshould be merged.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has put out some new ideas onhow to reduce the debt, but critics are saying they may be toolittle and too late. Other governments are expected to suggestdoing more.   Before the meetings open, President Barber Conable of the bank,a former congressman from New York, and Managing Director MichelCamdessus of the fund, a Frenchman, are trying to agree on how tocooperate. The United States and nine other leading governmentshave asked Lamberto Dini, the No. 2 at the Italian government'scentral bank, to report on improving the relations between the twininstitutions.   ``If they don't get their act together, there's going to be morepressure to merge them,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, who heads theprivate Institute for International Economics.   ``That would be a mistake, because they would only have to beseparated again after a few years.''   Bergsten used to be in charge of U.S. relations with them asassistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.   Both organizations are linked to the United Nations, but theyhave something it lacks: teeth. By giving or holding back loans andby the conditions they set, they can sometimes make or breakgovernments.   Their conditions can lead to violence. Most recently, areduction in government subsidies, urged by the fund, brought anincrease in bus fares that touched off riots last month inVenezuela. At least 300 people were killed.   Both the World Bank and the IMF were set up at a meeting inBretton Woods, N.H., as World War II came to an end. Westernleaders were hoping to nip in the bud the economic problems thathad twice helped to plunge the world into bloody conflict.   The bank, officially the International Bank for Reconstructionand Development, was to help the countries devastated by the war torecover a decent standard of living. As they did, the bank turnedto the Third World, making easy, long-term loans for schools,hospitals, farms, roads, ports _ the basic needs of poor countries.   India and Brazil were among the biggest borrowers.   The fund's job was to keep currencies stable. Big shifts incurrency values upset world trade, and bad trade relations can leadto bad political relations. As recently as the 1970s it was helpingBritain and Italy with such problems.   In time the fund too found itself working mostly in the ThirdWorld, where high values for local currencies wre making tradedifficult. Often the exchange rates were only part of a country'sproblem. The fund offered big loans and mobilized more from privatebanks. To get the loans, borrowing governments had to promisechanges in their policies _ austerity programs, often includingdevaluations, to put the debtors in better shape to keep up withtheir debts.   Billions went to Brazil, Mexico and other major debtors.   In 1985 James A. Baker III, then secretary of the Treasury, saidthe way out of the debt problem was more loans and more policychanges by the borrowers. The Baker plan called on the bank to mapout longer-term programs for them, since their problems went toodeep to be solved in a few years and the bank was used to takingthe long view. It had always made some ``policy-based'' loans. Nowit started making more.   So bank and fund, with headquarters facing one another indowntown Washington, found their jobs overlapping more and more.They approached problems from different viewpoints.   Lord Keynes, the British economist who helped set them up, wasquoted as saying that the bank is a fund and the fund is a bank.Funds are usually concerned with improving people's livingstandards; banks worry more about finance. But some of the IMF'sstaff of 1,600 have seen the World Bank as a collection of 6,000soft-minded do-gooders. Many in the bank thought the fund toopreoccupied with the world's financial system and insensitive topeople's needs.   Neither bank nor fund officials want to be quoted about theirdifferences, except to say that they try hard to work together. Butsome acknowledge privately that they have occasionally givencountries contradictory advice.   Last October the bank offered $700 million worth of loans toArgentina. The fund had been negotiating with Argentina for years,but could not get the government of President Raul Alfonsin to meetits conditions. The bank's offer raised a lot of eyebrows: in thepast, the bank had waited for the fund's approval of a country'spolicies before going ahead with its own lending.   In February, after disbursing $150 million, the bank decidedArgentina was not meeting its own conditions and refused todisburse another $350 million.   There were some quiet ``I-told-you-sos'' from sympathizers withthe fund, but officials said the bank's action showed that the twoinstitutions were closer to seeing eye-to-eye.</TEXT></DOC>
