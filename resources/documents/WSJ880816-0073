Today, the upper ranks of English society still drink Pimm's, though in weather that is rather damper and at contests somewhat tamer: the Ascot horse races, the Wimbledon tennis tournament, the Henley rowing regatta.    Pimm's -- first mixed in the 1840s by London oyster bar owner James Pimm and later popularized throughout the Empire -- is the quintessential high-society English drink, as much a summer institution here as the mint julep is in Dixie.    Now marketers at Guinness PLC, which acquired Pimm's when it bought Distillers Co. in 1986, are trying to widen its appeal. They want people to keep imbibing it after summer fades. And they want to demystify Pimm's by removing its elitist image -- in the process maybe even taking it (shhh!) down-market.    &quot;I can see a truck driver serving it to his guests on a Sunday afternoon,&quot; confides James Espey, deputy managing director and hotshot marketing strategist at Guinness's United Distillers unit.    Some self-appointed custodians of upper-crust values are aghast. But in increasingly classless Britain, apparently anything goes.    Exactly what's in Pimm's is a secret guarded as closely as the formula for Coca-Cola. Guinness says the ingredients -- liqueurs and fruit extracts from around the world -- are purchased in such a way that even its accountants would have difficulty reconstructing the blend. The drink usually is mixed in an icy pitcher with lemon soda, mint and chunks of cucumber and fruit. Served at outdoor fetes and garden parties, it's less formal than champagne and more festive than a gin and tonic.    The brown-colored concoction tastes as harmless as punch at a ladies' tea. But part of its appeal is that a cup of Pimm's packs a punch, even though its makers reduced the alcohol content slightly in February to appeal to younger drinkers.    Lady Elizabeth Anson, a cousin to Queen Elizabeth and a party consultant who often serves Pimm's at summer gatherings, would never countenance intoxication, of course. But for the record she states that &quot;the way to get extremely drunk&quot; on Pimm's is to eat the fruit floating in the drink.    Pimm's, which costs about #7 ($11.99) a bottle, isn't particularly pricey. Although Britons traditionally have stuck to the customs of their class, Guinness's strategy banks on many in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Britain aspiring to the Pimm's life style. &quot;Look at all the readers of the Sun {a popular tabloid} buying green Wellingtons and imitation Barbour jackets,&quot; Mr. Espey says, referring to the green rubber boots and oiled-cotton coats associated with the leisurely rich.    Despite its fame, Pimm's is a relatively small seller; retail sales in Britain amount to about #6 million a year, with roughly 70% sold in the summer. To widen the drink's appeal, a TV ad campaign was launched two years ago showing punks with fruit-colored, spiked hair drinking Pimm's. Even Mr. Espey says things got out of hand with that campaign: Punks aren't a big market, and few want to emulate their life style.    This summer, a new campaign encourages the occasional Pimm's drinker to order it regularly at his local pub. Videos show bartenders how easy it is to make a Pimm's. And for the untapped mass market, there are tastings run out of a bus at shopping centers around Britain.    Skeptics see possibilities. Ron Hadland, a rubber worker at the Dunlop Tyre plant in Birmingham, thinks people could be persuaded to try Pimm's -- which he thinks &quot;comes across as a woman's drink&quot; -- with &quot;lots of adverts on the telly.&quot;    Such popularization shocks some traditional Pimm's drinkers. &quot;The drink's definitely had it as far as all the people we document are concerned,&quot; says Harold Brooks-Baker, editor of Burke's Peerage, the address book of Britain's titled class. Mr. Brooks-Baker's own pedigree is well-documented; he's an American who moved to Britain in 1968. </TEXT></DOC>
