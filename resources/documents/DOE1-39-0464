We have cloned andmapped nineteen genes required for the growth of Methylobacterium organophilumstrain XX on methanol. Nineteen genes were found in seven linkage groupson the M. organophilum genome and were separated by 40 kb or more. Elevengenes were required for the synthesis of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH)and were located in three unlinked gene clusters. The MDH structuralgene was localized on a 2.5 kb DNA fragment. The gene was sequenced andcontains a 175 bp untranslated leader sequence, a signal sequence andthe structural gene. MDH messenger RNA (mRNA) has a half life of approximately20 min. and is present at approximately 2% of the cellular mRNA. Thestructural gene for the {gamma} subunit of methane monoxygenases hasbeen cloned from Methylosporovibrio. Methane monooxygenase subunits havebeen purified by Prof. J. Lipscomb's laboratory and are being sequencedto construct DNA probes to identify cloned subunit genes. New facultativemethylotrophic bacteria were isolated and characterized. Several aminoacid auxotrophs have been isolated. 11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
