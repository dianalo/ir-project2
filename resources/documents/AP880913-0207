The U.S. Embassy said it had ``high regard'' for the men andwould not force them to leave against their will.   Two of the three are senior officials of the now-banned UnitedDemocratic Front _ acting publicity secretary Murphy Morobe, ablack, and acting general secretary Mohammed Valli Moosa, anIndian. The other is Vusi Khanyile, a black who was chairman of thebanned National Education Crisis Committee.   The U.S. Embassy statement confirmed that the three had takenrefuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of an office building indowntown Johannesburg. The building is two miles from the hospitalwhere they were being treated.   The main U.S. embassy is in Pretoria.   Several associates of the escapees later met with U.S.Ambassador Edward Perkins and they said he assured them the menwould be well cared for.   The three have asked to meet with their relatives and withleaders of the anti-apartheid movement, but they have not disclosedany other requests.   ``We were in frequent contact with these three men prior totheir detention without charge, and hold them in high regard,'' theU.S. statement said. ``We will not press them to leave againsttheir will.''   The statement said the United States does not offer asylum atits diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolableunder international law and may not be entered by the hostgovernment without consent. The embassy said it was discussing thesituation with the activists and the South African government.   Jay Naidoo, an anti-apartheid labor leader, said he and severalcolleagues including Max Coleman conferred with Perkins, America'sfirst black ambassador to South Africa, and they were assured theescapees' physical needs would be cared for. Coleman said of thethree, ``They're very pleased to be where they are.''   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry,said the men had escaped from Johannesburg Hospital, where they hadbeen receiving physiotherapy. No details of the escape weredisclosed.   Previously, the three had been at Johannesburg's DiepkloofPrison.   At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security forcedeployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about twodozen journalists waited in the hall for several hours beforedispersing.   Morobe, 32, and Valli Moosa, 31, were detained in July 1987after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June12, 1986. Khanyile, 37, was detained in December 1986.   Between the emergency declaration and his detention, Morobeoperated from underground, wearing disguises and showing upunannounced at newspaper offices.   As one of the United Democratic Front's most eloquent writersand speakers, he played a key role in conveying the positions ofthe nation's largest anti-apartheid group, at a time when most ofits leaders were in jail or in hiding.   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge atsome point during the emergency. The government has not releasedcomprehensive statistics, but it said recently that 802 people whohad been held at least 30 days were still in custody.   Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliatedto the United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition of more than600 anti-apartheid groups.   Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the NationalEducation Crisis Committee, a coalition of parent, teacher andstudent groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculumand policies in their schools.   The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycottsthat spread nationwide in 1985-86. But when it subsequentlycampaigned for ``people's education,'' the government outlawed it.   The United Democratic Front and the crisis committee were among17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conductingany activities. The U.S. government was among many to condemn thesebannings.   Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomaticmissions in South Africa. Six United Democratic Front leadersstayed at the British Consulate in Durban for several weeks in late1984 before emerging to face arrest for high treason. The chargeslater were withdrawn.   In September 1987, South Africa agreed to let a Dutchman, Klausde Jonge, return to the Netherlands after being holed up at a DutchEmbassy office in Pretoria for two years.   De Jonge escaped into the office from police custody after beingarrested for aiding the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla movement.</TEXT></DOC>
