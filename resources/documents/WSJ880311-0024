As easy to prepare as frozen or canned products but boasting the freshness and eye appeal of home cooking. In the food business, they are known as &quot;fresh refrigerated&quot; products, and they are the biggest thing to hit the industry since the microwave.    But within the food industry as well as the Food and Drug Administration, there are growing concerns about fresh refrigerated foods, which include everything from pizza to filet mignon. According to many experts, the new packaging and processing techniques potentially offer a breeding ground for an array of dangerous bacteria, most notably those causing botulism. Ironically, consumers may be courting food poisoning in their haste to get the looks and tastes of mother's kitchen without any of the bother.    &quot;This is the unexplored side of the fresh, refrigerated foods business that could have very adverse consequences for consumers,&quot; says Joseph Hotchkiss, associate professor of food science at Cornell University. &quot;The science and technology are going into developing the new products, but virtually no one is doing research to find out what the risks are and how to control them.&quot;    Indeed, in a letter to the National Restaurant Association, the FDA has described &quot;sous-vide&quot; products -- fresh refrigerated foods packaged in oxygen-free pouches -- as being &quot;fraught with danger&quot; because of the risk of botulism. The agency has also criticized &quot;modified atmosphere&quot; packaging, which partially replaces oxygen with nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The agency is studying the products but hasn't issued any guidelines.    To date, there have been no reported cases of food poisoning or death from the new products. There is also little doubt that the U.S. food supply ranks as the safest in the world. Still, experts privately worry that the demands of the marketplace are outpacing the abilities of regulators and scientists.    &quot;Nobody ever asked us before to take totally prepared refrigerated products and distribute them from New York to San Francisco,&quot; says Aaron Brody, vice president for strategic studies at Shotland Business Research in Princeton, N.J. &quot;We food technologists don't know how to do it.&quot;    Fresh refrigerated products are designed to offer the convenience of frozen and canned foods while providing homemade taste and appearance. Typically, they are cooked just enough to ward off spoilage for a short period of time. As a further aid to freshness, they also are often sealed in packaging that contains little or no oxygen, which can extend shelf life for several weeks.    Consumers are beginning to clamor for the new products. A Michigan State University study estimates that fresh prepared foods now account for about $500 million of the $450 billion U.S. food market. Industry analysts estimate sales will grow a rapid 14% a year.    What accounts for the success? People are sick of canned and frozen goods that are processed to a pulp, food experts say, and they are less concerned about the dangers of fresh refrigerated foods than they are about the dangers associated with food additives.    &quot;They perceive the risk (from fresh refrigerated foods) only as a bellyache,&quot; says Mona Doyle, president of Consumer Network, a research company in Philadelphia. &quot;And to them, a bellyache is better than the possibility of cancer from a lifetime of preservatives and additives.&quot;    But scientists are concerned that some dangerous bacteria may not be killed during the minimal precooking characteristic of fresh refrigerated foods. And the microorganisms that cause botulism can flourish in an oxygen-free environment -- precisely the kind of packaging used for many of the new products.    Moreover, the most dangerous bacteria -- listeria, yersinia and botulism -- don't always make food smell or taste spoiled. The telltale signs of spoilage are caused by other microorganisms, which generally are inhibited or eliminated in the processing of fresh refrigerated products. In other words, the new foods could be -- but not taste or look -- unsafe to eat.    Of course, no food-processing technique is completely safe. But older technologies do offer better safeguards against food poisoning. The temperature of frozen foods is too cold for bacteria to grow. Canned foods are cooked at sterilization temperatures. Conventional refrigerated foods like milk or butter typically show signs of spoilage, and their processing is geared toward eliminating bacteria through techniques such as pasteurizing.    &quot;What is really alarming (about fresh refrigerated foods) is that consumers could do everything right and there could still be a problem, particularly if the product wasn't heated again,&quot; says Lloyd Moberg, head of the microbiology department at General Mills Inc.    Sous-vide, a technology imported from France, has sparked the most controversy because of the fear of botulism. The technique, which reached the U.S. in the early 1980s, is essentially four-star dining out of a plastic bag.    Sous-vide calls for sealing fresh raw ingredients in an oxygen-free pouch, which is then cooked under precisely controlled heat and moisture conditions. The pouch is then chilled and ultimately given a quick cooking before landing on a diner's plate. The appeal: enhanced flavor, the preservation of freshness for three weeks or more -- and, as a growing number of U.S. restaurateurs report, decreased labor and food costs. The technology also holds out the promise of virtually kitchenless restaurants, which can just reheat pouches produced off-site.    &quot;Initially, I worried about the idea of customers thinking of this as meals on wheels,&quot; admits Ed Albany, general manager of the Petroleum Club of New Orleans, a private club owned by Restaurant Marketing Associates, of Media, Pa. &quot;But I will challenge anyone to a taste test of the product.&quot; Despite the FDA's warnings, Mr. Albany plans to continue using sous-vide products.    Not surprisingly, the market's strong sales are attracting big food processors. Carnation Co., for example, is racing to build a national presence with its Contadina Fresh Pasta andamp; Cheese line. General Foods Corp. is testing its Culinova gourmet entrees and Ronzoni refrigerated pasta and sauces. And Kraft Inc. recently began testing its Chillery line of refrigerated salads as well as pizza kits and pasta-and-sauce dinners.    These companies maintain that the potential hazards are only a concern with smaller manufacturers. &quot;This is a very unregulated area, and it has a lot of little regional companies who may be operating on a wing and a prayer,&quot; says Stephen Cunliffe, president of Carnation's Pasta andamp; Cheese subsidiary. Thomas L. Schwarz, an official in the retail food protection branch at the FDA, acknowledges that the agency is more worried about processing techniques at smaller companies but quickly adds: &quot;More people might be affected if a large company makes a mistake.&quot;    Bringing refrigerated products to market is an exercise in complexity. Culinary Brands -- a closely held food processor in Sausalito, Calif., that specializes in sous-vide offerings like turtle soup and poached Norwegian salmon -- prepares its delicacies in a clean-room environment. Employees don masks, gloves, booties and hospital gowns. To deliver on the promise of freshness, the company ships the foods by Federal Express to a handful of hotel chains now experimenting with the concept.    Similarly, General Foods' Culinova subsidiary shuns the traditional supermarket warehouse system. Instead, it uses its own delivery system and its own refrigerated kiosks in stores to prevent temperature abuse that can speed spoilage. Beyond that, the company concocts its recipes to control moisture and acidity levels -- all to control the growth of bacteria.    While Culinova also depends on modified atmosphere packaging to help preserve its 21-day shelf life, David Olsen, technical director of General Foods' meals division, says: &quot;We have less oxygen than in the atmosphere, but it isn't enough to encourage&quot; the growth of bacteria. Even so, Mr. Moberg of General Mills says he &quot;never would have let that product out the door.&quot; In his view, most fresh refrigerated products on the market today don't have &quot;sufficient barriers to prevent potential hazards.&quot;    &quot;We didn't fully develop these products before we hammered them into the marketplace,&quot; says Shotland's Mr. Brody, who pioneered the development of a modified atmosphere preservation system at Whirlpool Corp. &quot;We are trying to rush things into the marketplace before we fully understand what we are doing.&quot;    ---                     Accepting the Risks   Many consumers who want refrigerated foods also know that they may carry health risks. Consumers, for instance, were asked to comment on this statement: Refrigerated foods without preservatives involve many more risks of foodborne illness than frozen prepared foods. Their responses:    Agree                          63%    Disagree                       29%    No opinion                      7%   Source: The Consumer Network</TEXT></DOC>
