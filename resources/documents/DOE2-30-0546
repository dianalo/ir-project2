<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0546 </DOCNO><TEXT>A D/sup +/ beam of kinetic energy T/sub i/=0.7 MeV was stored in a 'simplemirror' magnetic field as self-colliding orbits or migma and neutralizedby ambient, oscillating electrons whose bounce frequencies were externallycontrolled. Space charge density was exceeded by an order of magnitudewithout instabilities. These nondestructive diagnosis methods allowedmeasurements of ion orbit distributions, ion storage times, ion energydistributions, nuclear reaction rate, and reaction product spectrum.The proton energy spectrum for d+d -andgt; T+p+4 MeV shows that dd collidedat an average crossing angle of 160/sup 0/. Evidence for exponentialdensity buildup has also been observed. Relative to Migma III resultsand measured in terms of the product of ion energy E, density n, andconfinement time tau, device performance was improved by a factor of500. The stabilizing features of migma are: (1) large Larmor radius;(2) small canonical angular momentum; (3) short axial length z (discshape); (4) nonadiabatic motions in r and z; (5) precession and energyspread; (6) ambipolar potential; (7) radial density gradient; (8) largeion-to-electron temperature ratio; (9) metal walls in z; (10) suitabilityfor external stabilization techniques (small volume, recurrent surfacingof ions); and particularly (11) diamagnetic well. Extrapolation of theresults to reactor densities led to a D+/sup 3/He reactor 'basic migmadisc' 0.5 m in diameter and 0.25 m thick, suspended in a 10 T field,generating 1.5 MW(th). A 2-MW(e) power plant would consist of 3 suchdiscs in a common volume, referred to as a triplet migmacell. Its specificpower is projected to be 1 MW(e)</TEXT></DOC>
