Reagan urged state governments to set up bipartisan citizencommissions to redraw boundaries after the 1990 national census.   ``I think it will be a big issue in the 1990s and I intend to bein the thick of it,'' Reagan said in a 20-minute speech to morethan 4,000 people attending the National Restaurant Association's70th Restaurant and Hotel-Motel Show.   ``I am putting the legislators on notice to keep it fair or theymay find the Gipper on the steps of their state capitols callingattention to their shenanigans,'' he said, drawing laughter.   Reagan also called for steps to balance the federal budget,saying he was ``working to help future presidents ... get the toolsthey need to bring the budget under control,'' including aconstitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget and thepresidential power to veto a budget line by line.   The Republican senior statesman said the House ofRepresentatives, which is dominated by Democrats, ``has becomevirtually a permanent chamber.''   ``It has less turnover than the Supreme Soviet,'' Reagan said,adding that 98 percent of the incumbents who ran for re-electionlast year won.   He called gerrymandering _ the rigging of congressionaldistricts' boundaries to assure a majority vote to one party oranother _ an ``abuse of power that distorts democracy.''   Reagan said Americans must ``be vigilant and protective of theirpowers or those powers will be ceded to Washington.''   ``Be strong and courageous ... go to the polls ... take aninterest in government, and let your representatives know how youfeel ... and what you want,'' he said.   He reiterated his support for repealing the 22nd Amendment tothe U.S. Constitution, which limits a president to two terms.   ``Since I'm already out to pasture this amendment doesn't affectme, but I think it should be repealed,'' he said, labeling it``another area where the people's democratic rights are beingthwarted.''   After his speech, Reagan stayed on stage for 40 minutes toanswer questions from the audience, sign autographs and shake hands.   Asked what he was doing with his spare time, he noted that hehad made a number of speeches in the four months since he left thepresidency.   ``I'm looking for my spare time,'' the former president joked.``I'm enjoying it.''</TEXT></DOC>
