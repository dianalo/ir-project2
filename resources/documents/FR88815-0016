The purpose of this rule now being published is to addGeorgia and South Carolina to the list of States for which alligator exportwould be approved, and to issue Service findings on a revised harvest programin Florida to enable continued export of alligators from that State. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scientific Authority Findings </ITAG>Article IV of the Convention requires that an export permit for any specimenof a species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certainfindings have been made by the Scientific Authority and Management Authorityof the exporting country. The Scientific Authority must advise ``that suchexport will not be detrimental to the survival of that species'' beforea permit can be granted by the Management Authority. The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problemsof potential threat to the survival of American alligators [ConventionArticle II.2(a)] and its similarity in appearance to other crocodiliansthat are threatened with possible extinction [Convention Article II.2(b)].The marking of hides, meat, and parts with specified tags and documentationof shipments, as well as the issuance of export permits, is consideredsufficient to address the issue of identification due to the similarityin appearance between American alligators and other listed species (seeManagement Authority findings for export program and tag specifications).Inasmuch as the alligator is also listed because of a potential threatto its survival, the Service must determine if exports will not be detrimentalto the survival of the American alligator itself. Guidelines developed for Scientific Authority advice on exports of Americanalligators under the provisions of Convention Article II.2(a), are summarizedas follows: A. Minimum requirements for biological information (1) Information on the condition of the population, including trends (themethod of determination to be a matter of State choice), and populationestimates where such information is available; (2) Information on total harvest of the species; (3) Information on distribution of harvest; and (4) Habitat evaluation. B. Minimum requirements for a management program (1) There should be a controlled harvest, methods and seasons to be a matterof State choice; (2) All hides should be registered and marked; and (3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the State.The Service's Office of Scientific Authority finds that current informationon population status, management, and harvest submitted by the States ofFlorida, Georgia, and South Carolina, as well as information collectedby the Service fully support a finding that the export of alligators takenin accordance with State regulations in these States during the 1988 harvestseason will not be detrimental to the survival of the species in the listedStates. Tagging of hides by the States and documentation of shipments bythe U.S. Management Authority provide assurance that export will not reducethe effectiveness of the Convention in controlling trade in other speciesof crocodilians. Documents containing information that provided the basisfor the Service's findings are available for public inspection at the Officeof Scientific Authority (address given above). <ITAG tagnum="84">Management Authority Findings </ITAG>Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under the Convention onlyif the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens were not obtainedin contravention of laws enacted for the protection of the involved species.The Service, therefore, must be satisfied that alligator hides, meat orproducts were not obtained in violation of State or Federal law in orderto allow export. Evidence of legal taking for American alligator is providedby Service-approved State tagging programs. The Service annually contractsfor the manufacture and delivery of special Convention animal-hide tagsfor export-qualified States. In a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, published on April 24, 1986 (52 FR 15548),the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of a US-CITIEStag symbol. This symbol appers on every Service-approved export tag toprovide legal evidence of export approval for certain Convention AppendixII listed species. Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State Americanalligator export programs, slightly modified from the 1986-1988 rule, underprovisions of Convention Article IV.2(b), are summarized as follows: (1) Current State alligator trapping and tagging, meat, and parts processingregulations must be on file with the Office of Management Authority; (2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat packing seal, and parts tagmust be on file with the Office of Management Authority; (3) The export tag must be durable and permanently locking, and must showU.S.-CITIES logo, State of origin, year of take, species, and be seriallyunique; (4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag must be applied to all hides,meat or parts, within a minimum time after take or processing, as specifiedby State law, and such time should be as short as possible to minimizemovement of untagged hides, meat, or parts; (5) The tags or seals must be permanently attached, as mandated by theState; (6) All alligator harvesters and processors must be State registered; (7) All hide, meat, and parts dealers are to be State registered; (8) All State-registered alligator harvesters, processors, and dealersmust make available their alligator harvest and commerce data to the Stateon at least an annual basis, as specified by the State;(9) State-registered alligator dealers and licensed harvesters allowedto attach export tags to the hides must account for all tags received andmust return unused tags to the State within a specified time after theharvest period closes; and  (10) Fully manufactured alligator hide products may be exported from theUnited States when the State-hide Covention export tags, removed from hidescontained in manufactured products, are surrendered to the Service priorto export.  The Service's Office of Management Authority has reviewed the alligatorexport tagging programs of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina and hasfound that they fully meet the guidelines listed above. Documents containinginformation that provide the basis for the Service's findings are availablefor public inspection at the Office of Management Authority (address givenabove).  The Service approves exports of 1988 alligators harvested in Florida, Georgia,and South Carolina on the grounds that both Scientific Authority and ManagementAuthority export requirements are satisfied. Public Comment No comment was received concerning the proposed rule published on July15, 1988 (53 FR 26799). This final rule is issued under authority of the Endangered Species Actof 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The authors are S Ronald Singer, Office of Managementof Authority, and Dr. Charles W. Dane, Office of Scientific Authority.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_The Department had previously determined that the exportof alligators of various States taken in the 1986-1988 harvest seasons,was not a major Federal action that would significantly affect the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of section 102(1)(c) of theNational Environmental Policy Act, therefore, the preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement was not required (48 FR 37494). Because these findingsdo not significantly differ from the previous export findings, the previousdetermination not to prepare and Environmental Impact Statement on exportof alligators taken during the 1986-1988 harvest seasons in certain States(51 FR 31130) remains appropriate. The Department had also previously determinedthat such harvest was not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 anddid not have a significant economic affect on a substantial number of smallentities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). Because theexisting rule treats exports on a State-by-State basis and approves exportin accordance with a State management/export program, the rule will havelittle effect on small entities in and of itself. This rule does not containany information collection requirements that require approval by the Officeof Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG>This rule adds Georgia and South Carolina to those States already permittedto export this species and authorizes the expansion of the already existingprogram in Florida. The export of American alligator is a necessary portionof a State's alligator management program as the foreign markets for thisspecies are dependent upon this final rule. The buying season is now underwayin the already permitted States. The rule announced in this notice is tobecome effective upon publication so that export can begin in these additionalStates as soon as possible. This will enable these new States their shareof the export market, enable the alligator farmers and trappers to realizea monetary return for their product, and infuse the resulting State shareof export monies into State alligator programs. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 23 </ITAG>Endangered and threatened wildlife, Exports, Fish, Imports, Plants (agriculture),Treaties. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 23_ENDANGERED SPECIES CONVENTION </ITAG>Accordingly, the Service amends Part 23 of Title 50, Code of Federal Regulations,as set forth below:1.
