The dramatic May 28, 1987, flight shook the foundation of Sovietsecurity and oiled the way for the ouster of Defense MinisterSergei L. Sokolov and Air Defense chief Alexander Koldunov, butSoviet citizens still grin at the audacity of the young pilot andhis success in putting one over on the mighty Kremlin.   Soviet jets scrambled when Rust crossed into restricted airspaceover the republic of Estonia, but the Soviet Air Defense forcestook no action to halt the flight.   Then, with apparently no warning to security forces in thenation's capital, the single-engine Cessna swept toward the heartof Soviet power and buzzed Kremlin landmarks such as Lenin's tomband Spassky Tower.   Rust, now 20, was sentenced Sept. 4 to four years at ageneral-regime labor camp on charges of malicious mischief. Bymutual consent with the Soviet government, he is serving his timeat the infamous Lefortovo Prison in eastern Moscow, which in thepast contained American journalist Nicholas Daniloff and U2 pilotFrancis Gary Powers.   A source close to the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said Rust asked to remain at Lefortovo rather than transfer to aless restrictive penal institution because the little-used KGBfacility is more easily accessible to his parents and West Germandiplomats who are allowed to make regular visits.   At Lefortovo, Rust has been allowed more visits than he isofficially entitled to. His parents, Karl-Heinz and Monika Rust,and his 16-year-old brother Ingo, have visited Lefortovo at leastfive times since June. Under Soviet corrections regulations,prisoners are allowed one visit every three months.   A representative of the West German Embassy is allowed to visitonce each month to bring mail, books and special foods to augmentthe prison diet.   Rust's appeal of his four-year sentence was turned down latelast year.   The young amateur pilot from suburban Hamburg has issued apersonal request for clemency that does not require a formal reply.To date, there has been no reply.   Soviet officials have commented privately that Rust will likelyserve at least half of his term, to show that the Kremlin does nottake such stunts lightly and to discourage any similar incidents inthe future.   Rust was accused during his two-day trial of endangering thelives of thousands of airline passengers when he piloted hisborrowed Cessna 172-B from Helsinki, Finland through the flightpaths of foreign airliners headed for Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.   Witnesses testified that he could have injured some of thehundreds of pedestrians at Red Square on the cool, sunny eveningwhen he landed.   Rust told the court he felt ``remorse and deep repentance'' andnever intended to endanger or insult anyone.   Before landing in the square, Rust piloted his blue and whitecraft at a low altitude through more than 500 miles of closelyguarded Soviet territory.   The dramatic stunt was followed by a short-lived moment of gloryfor Rust as tourists and Muscovites crowded around the plane thatcame to a rest between St. Basil's Cathedral and the red-brick wallsurrounding the Kremlin. They asked for the pilot's autograph andtook his picture as he reclined against the fuselage before hisarrest.   Less than 48 hours later, the ruling Politburo met in specialsession and sent Sokolov into retirement and fired Koldunov fornegligence.</TEXT></DOC>
