Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee said he expects the panel to vote next Tuesday to extend the debt limit until Aug. 7 or Aug. 8, when Congress hopes to begin a one-month recess.    The Illinois Democrat added that he expected the House would take up the short-term extension Wednesday. After Wednesday, the Treasury says the government will begin to default on its obligations if its authority to borrow isn't renewed.    A spokesman for House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) said a brief extension of the debt ceiling next week would be considered if it was necessary to prevent the unprecedented default. A vote hasn't been scheduled.    The Senate would have to accept the House action in order to lift the limit. But in that chamber, the fate of the debt-ceiling bill is uncertain.    The Ways and Means Committee is also considering tax legislation to help reduce the federal budget deficit. But members say the panel isn't likely to begin drafting any tax increase until after the August recess. The tax writers are hoping that, come September, President Reagan might be under more pressure to agree to support a tax increase, which he currently opposes.    Since the debt ceiling expired a week ago, the Senate has been snagged on disagreements over an important amendment to legislation that would extend the debt limit. Last night, the Senate killed two versions of the amendment, which would have reinvigorated the automatic, across-the-board cuts of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    Gramm-Rudman is largely ineffective because the Supreme Court last year struck down one of its central elements for enforcing the automatic cuts. But many lawmakers have said they won't vote to allow the government to borrow more money until some automatic method of shrinking the budget deficit is established.    Last night, however, the Democratic-controlled Senate rejected an intricate Democratic plan by the surprisingly wide margin of 71-25. And on a procedural vote of 49-47, the Senate set aside a simpler Republican proposal. Both measures would have slashed as much as $36 billion from projected government spending each year, beginning with fiscal 1988, which starts Oct. 1.    Proposals for across-the-board cuts are being constructed as backstops in case Congress and President Reagan don't agree to a deficit-reduction package of their own. The severity of the automatic cuts, which would be divided equally between military and nonmilitary spending, also is designed to force the two sides to come to terms.    Budget leaders said they hoped they would return to the bargaining table today to try to devise a compromise Gramm-Rudman procedure that could pass the Senate. </TEXT></DOC>
