In the case of ACH credit transactions, funds flowfrom the originator of the payment to the receiver. The majority of ACHcredit payments are payroll, pension, or annuity payments. In the caseof ACH debit transactions, funds flow from the receiver to the originator.The majority of ACH debit transactions are used to collect insurance premiums,bill payments, and mortgage loan payments. In addition, ACH debit transactionsare used for cash concentration purposes, that is, to draw down balancesfrom the accounts of affiliates or subsidiaries located throughout thecountry, and they account for the largest proportion of the dollar valueof ACH transactions.The ACH is a value-dated mechanism. Transactions may be originated oneor two days before the settlement date and may be processed on one of thetwo operating cycles_a day or a night cycle. All ACH transactions are provisionalpayments. The Reserve Banks currently reserve the right to reverse creditsgiven to receivers of ACH credit transactions until the entries are postedon the settlement day, and credit given for debit transactions may currentlybe reversed by a Reserve Bank until the opening of business on the dayfollowing settlement. In addition, institutions receiving debit transactionshave the right to return them.<ITAG tagnum="84">Previous Proposal and Comments </ITAG>In December 1986, the Board requested comments on the following proposals(Docket No. R-0591, 51 FR 45043, December 16, 1986):andbullet; To provide finality to receivers of ACH credit transactions amountingto $5,000 or less at 1:00 p.m. local time on the settlement date;andbullet; To provide finality to receivers of ACH credit transactions amountingto more than $5,000 when the Reserve Banks have received actually and finallycollected funds;andbullet; to notify receivers of ACH credit transactions if payments werereversed before the time of finality on a ``best efforts'' basis; and andbullet; to retain the right to reverse ACH debit transactions at any timeuntil the Reserve Bank has received actually and finally collected funds.The Board received 112 comments on these proposals. The majority of commentersopposed the proposals. In the case of the proposals concerning ACH credittransactions, commenters stated that there was no good reason to distinguishbetween small and large-dollar credit transactions, that the dollar amountsproposed were arbitrary, and that finality should be granted at a specifictime for all ACH credit transactions. Eighty-five percent of the commentersbelieved that small-dollar credit transactions should be treated as finalat the opening of business on the settlement day. All commenters believedthat a specific time should be set for the finality of large-dollar credittransactions, and more than 50 percent believed that all ACH credit transactionsshould be treated as final at the opening of business on the settlementday. Commenters believed that delaying finality for ACH credit transactionsamounting to $5,000 or more and ACH debit transactions until the ReserveBanks had received actually and finally collected funds would add substantiallyto the risk of participating institutions and their customers. They indicatedthat the increased uncertainty resulting from adoption of this proposalwould reduce the attractiveness of the ACH mechanism. A majority of commentersargued that finality should be granted at a specific time and indicatedthat they would prefer that the same time be designated for both debitand credit transactions. If the Reserve Banks were to grant finality for all ACH credit transactionsat the opening of business on the settlement day, as many commenters onthe 1986 proposal suggested, the credit exposure currently faced by receivinginstitutions would be eliminated. The Reserve Banks' risk, however, wouldbe substantially increased because they would not be able to reverse anypayments on the settlement day without regard to whether the originatinginstitution had sufficient funds in its account to cover the payments.The Board believes that no distinction should be made concerning the finalityaccorded large and small-dollar ACH credit transactions. While commenterswould prefer that finality be granted at the opening of business on thesettlement day, the Board believes that the risk faced by the Reserve Banksis too great to adopt this proposal. In order to balance the risk facedby the Reserve Banks with that faced by receiving institutions, the Boardbelieves that finality for ACH credit transactions should be granted at6:30 p.m. local time, a time late enough on the settlement day to permitthe Reserve Banks to recover some funds, if it is determined that an originatoris unable to cover the payments that it has originated. With regard to the proposal to treat credits given for ACH debit transactionsas final only after they had received actually and finally collected funds,the majority of commenters opposed this proposal. They indicated that aspecific time should be adopted after which a Reserve Bank would not reversecredits given for ACH debit transactions. The Reserve Banks' risk would not differ substantially under the termsof the current operating circular or the proposal published for commentin 1986. To provide greater certainty for depository institutions, theBoard proposes to treat credits given to originators of ACH debit transactionsas final at 10:00 a.m. local time on the business day following the settlementday. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Three issues have been considered in the timing of finality for ACH credittransactions: (1) Current practices and customs; (2) the credit exposurefaced by the Federal Reserve and by depository institutions; and (3) thepotential that changes in the treatment of finality for ACH transactionsmay result in shifts in the use of payment mechanisms. <T3>Current Practices</T3>_The Reserve Banks' ACH operating circular currentlyindicates that credit given to receivers of ACH credit transactions isavailable for use on the settlement day. At the same time, the ReserveBanks reserve the right not to settle for an item after notice of the suspensionor closing of the originator or the receiver is received.\1\<NOTE/> In addition, the Reserve Banks may cease acting on or settlingfor a credit item if a Reserve Bank judges that there may not be sufficientfunds in the originator's account on the settlement day to cover the item.\2\<NOTE/> Based on these provisions, the Reserve Banks have the rightto reverse credit transactions until all transactions affecting reserveor clearing accounts have been posted on the settlement day. Further, ReserveBanks are not obligated to notify depository institutions before transactionsare reversed although notices would typically be provided the businessday following the reversal of transactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Uniform ACH Operating Letter, paragraphs 24 and 25. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Ibid., </T3>paragraph 31. Other rules and regulations_Regulation CC, Regulation E, and NACHA rules_alsoinfluence depository institutions' treatment of ACH credit transactions.The Board's Regulation CC requires depository institutions to make fundsreceived via ACH credit transactions available for withdrawal no laterthan the opening of business on the business day following the settlementdate, but does not preempt existing rules that may require earlier availability(12 CFR 229.10(b)). The Board's Regulation E requires depository institutionsto credit consumers' accounts as of the settlement day but does not specifya time of day, and it does not require depository institutions to makefunds available for use on the day they are credited (12 CFR 205.10(a)(2)and Official Staff Commentary, Q10-13). NACHA rules, which are incorporatedin the Reserve Banks' Uniform ACH Operating Letter, are more stringentand require depository institutions to make funds available for both consumerand corporate payments on the settlement day.\3\<NOTE/> Further, NACHA guidelines encourage depository institutionsto make funds available to consumers at the opening of business on thesettlement day.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Operating rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association,</T3>pages OR 12. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>Operating Guidelines of the National Automated Clearing House Association,</T3>pages OG V-8. <T3>Current Practices</T3>_Payroll, pension, and annuity payments are typicallyprocessed one or two days before the settlement date, and transaction dataare generally provided to receiving institutions before the settlementdate. The majority of depository institutions make these payments availableto consumers at the opening of business on the settlement day. Larger dollarcorporate-to-corporate payments are typically processed at night, withtransaction data generally provided to receiving institutions at the openingof business on the settlement date. Funds availability practices vary;funds may be made available to customers on the settlement day, or notuntil the business day following the settlement day.  <T3>Credit Exposure</T3>_The credit exposure faced by depository institutionsand the Federal Reserve varies inversely based on the finality accordedACH credit transactions. That is, as Federal Reserve risk is reduced, depositoryinstitutions' risk tends to rise.Under the Reserve Banks' current ACH operating circular, receiving depositoryinstitutions are generally exposed to some risk of loss on the settlementday as well as the business day following the settlement day. This riskis due to most institutions' practice of making funds available to theircustomers on the settlement day even though the Reserve Banks reserve theright to reverse transactions until the time all reserve and clearing accountshave been posted. If payments are reversed and customers do not reimbursetheir depository institution for the funds they have used, the institutionwould experience a loss. The Reserve Banks' risk is limited to situationsin which it is not discovered that an originator is unable to fund itspayments until the day following the settlement day.While receiving institutions are exposed to the risk of financial loss,the Federal Reserve has taken steps to reduce this risk. The Reserve Bankshave implemented precedures to monitor ACH credit transactions originatedby ``problem'' institutions, that is institutions in weak financial positions.In addition the Reserve Banks are implementing procedures that permit themto require problem depository institutions to prefund or pledge collateralto cover the value of credit transactions originated at the time they aredeposited for processing.Furthermore, over 90 percent of all ACH credit transactions are payroll,pension, and annuity payments. The median value of these payments is lessthan $600, and the depository institutions receiving such payments aregenerally a highly diverse group. As a result, the potential financialloss faced by institutions receiving small-dollar payments is not substantial.<T3>Changes in the Use of Payment Transactions</T3>_It does not appearthat there has been a shift of funds transfers to the ACH. Nevertheless,the Board believes that granting finality for ACH credit transactions atthe opening of business on the settlement day could lessen the distinctionbetween the ACH and the funds transfer mechanisms and provide incentivesfor depository institutions to change their payment practices.<T3>Proposed Finality Terms</T3>_After review of the current practices,the credit exposure of despository institutions and Reserve Banks, andthe potential for shifts in payments transactions, the Board has determinedthat Federal Reserve policies should provide receivers of ACH credit transactionsmore certainty regarding the time at which the Reserve Banks grant finality.Accomplishing this objective poses several problems for the Reserve Banks.First, supervisors of depository institutions typically close institutionslate in the day. The Reserve Banks, therefore, generally would not be ableto begin notifying receiving institutions that an originator is being closeduntil late in the afternoon. Second, over 20,000 institutions use the ACHmechanism. While all of these institutions ordinarily would not be affectedby the closing of one originating institution, a potentially large numberof institutions may be affected and a considerable amount of time may berequired to notify those institutions that transactions will be reversed.In order to balance the risks faced by the Reserve Banks and receivingdepository institutions, the Board proposes that ACH credit transactionsbe treated as final payments to the receiver at 6:30 p.m. local time forthe receiver on the settlement day. The Reserve Banks will provide receivinginstitutions the name of the originating institution whose transactionswill be reversed by means of a wire notice to institutions with on-lineconnections to Fedwire before 6:30 p.m. local time. If notice of reversalis not sent to an on-line receiving institution by 6:30 p.m. local time,then the items will be considered to be final. For those institutions thatdo not have on-line connections to Fedwire, the Reserve Bank will attemptto give notice by telephone by 6:30 p.m. local time. Due to the difficultyof making potentially numerous telephone calls to institutions that havealready closed for business for the day, the Board does not believe thatit should accept the losses that may accure if notice can not be givenby 6:30 p.m. Therefore, the firm 6:30 p.m. finality only applies to on-lineinstitutions. For other institutions, the Reserve Banks will attemp togive notice, but the transactions will not become final if such noticeis not given by 6:30 p.m.The Board requests comments on the proposed 6:30 p.m. finality. The Boardalso requests comment on whether this notice is useful to the receivinginstitution without the accompanying transaction data, and how late after6:30 p.m. this notice may be given and still be useful to the receivinginstitution. Because timely notice can be best provided through computerconnections, the Board requests comments on how the 6:30 p.m. time fornotification of reversals should be handled if (1) a Reserve Bank's computeris down; or (2) a receiving institution's computer is down or shut off.Granting finality at 6:30 p.m. local time exposes the Reserve Banks tosome risk of loss. Specifically, losses may be incurred if an originatorwere closed unexpectedly and had not funded the ACH credit transactionsit had originated before it was closed. In addition, losses could be incurredif institutions located in the mid-west and western parts of the countryare closed late in the day. For example, if an institution located in Californiawere closed at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, the Reserve Banks may be able tonotify receiving institutions located in the Mountain and Pacific timezones that transactions originated by the institution would be reversedbefore 6:30 p.m. local time. Because the time set for finality in the Centraland Eastern time zones would have passed before the California institutionwas closed, the Reserve Banks would not be able to reverse transactionsin those regions of the country and would absorb any losses incurred. TheBoard requests comments on whether it is appropriate for the Federal Reserveto accept such risk of loss and whether commenters believe that a privateACH processor would accept this type of risk.It is proposed that, after giving a receiving institution notice of theclosing of an originator, the Reserve Banks will make available to receivingdepository institutions data on the individual transactions that are beingreversed. This transaction data will be provided before the opening ofbusiness on the business day following the settlement day. In the caseof institutions with electronic connections to the Reserve Banks or thatpick up their ACH transactions at a Federal Reserve office, reversed transactionswould be made available no later than the close of the night cycle. Forinstitutions whose transactions are delivered via courier or mail, thedata would be included with transactions delivered on the next deliveryto the institution. In addition to comments on this proposal, the Boardalso requests that commenters give the latest time that a depository institutioncould receive reversal transactions and still update its accounts beforeopening for business on the day following the scheduled settlement date.As an added protection against potential losses, the Board proposes thatthe Reserve Banks reserve the right to charge the accounts of originatinginstitutions any time during the settlement day for all ACH credit transactionssettling on that day. The Reserve Banks would use this right in situationswhere there were concerns about an originator's ability to fund ACH credittransactions on the settlement day. This change would reduce the probabilitythat the Reserve Banks would need to reverse transactions that had beendelivered to receiving institutions. As a result, it would reduce the riskfaced by receivers of ACH credit transactions.<T3>ACH Debit Transactions_</T3>The Reserve Banks' ACH operating circularcurrently indicates that credits given for ACH debit items will not bereversed after the opening of business on the business day following thesettlement day. It also indicates that a Reserve Bank may refuse to permitthe use of credit given for a debit item if it judges that there may notbe sufficient funds in the originator's account to cover chargeback orreturn of the item.\5\<NOTE/> This finality granted by the Reserve Banks does not changethe receiver's right of return.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Uniform ACH Operating Letter, paragraph 23.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>Ibid, </T3>paragraph 33.<T3>Credit Exposure_</T3>The risk faced by institutions originating ACHdebit transactions is not affected substantially by the finality grantedby the Federal Reserve. In most cases, some portion of debit transactionsare returned by receiving insitutions, and the return items may not bereceived by the originating institution until as many as five days followingthe settlement day. Most depository institutions have agreements with theircustomers to charge back such items. Alternatively, they place holds onfunds collected through the ACH if they are concerned about the financialstability of their corporate customer.Because institutions receiving ACH debit transactions are obligated tosettle for them by the close of business on the settlement day, the ReserveBanks are able to determine whether debit items have been paid when alltransactions have been posted to reserve or clearing accounts. As a result,a Reserve Bank would be able to determine whether payments needed to bereversed in the morning on the business day following the settlement day.To provide greater certainty for depository institutions, the Board proposesto treat credits given to originators of ACH debit transactions as finalat 10:00 a.m. local time on the business day following the settlement day.If a receiver of debit transactions fails and the ACH transactions areto be reversed, the Board proposes to advise originators of ACH debit transactionsof the name of the receiving institutions whose payments are being reversedby 10:00 a.m. on the business day following the settlement day. Transactiondata on these reversals would be made available to institutions with electronicconnections to the Reserve Banks or to those that pick up their transactionsat a Federal Reserve office no later than the close of the day cycle onthe business day following the original settlement date. Reversal transactionswould be included on the next delivery to institutions served by couriersor the Postal Service.<T3>Debit Item Adjustments_</T3>The NACHA rules permit receiving institutionsto return consumer debit transactions up to about 45 days after the settlementdate, if a consumer provides notice that such debit entry was, in wholeor in part, not authorized by the consumer.\7\<NOTE/> Such returns are called debit item adjustments and the ReserveBanks process and settle for them. If the originator of the debit itemhas failed before the item is submitted for processing, the Reserve Bankscurrently would be obligated to credit the returning institution and wouldonly have a claim against the failed bank or possibly the failed bank'scustomer. Processing debit item adjustments, therefore, exposes the ReserveBanks to some risk of loss.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association,</T3>page OR 17.This right of a consumer to obtain credit on the basis that an ACH debittransaction was not authorized differs from a customer's right to obtaincredit in the case of a forged or altered check. In the case of a forgedcheck, the payor (receiving) bank bears the risk. In the case of a forgedindorsement or an altered check, the customer must prove the alterationof forgery, and the receiving bank must claim against prior banks on thebasis of breach of warranty.The Board does not believe it is reasonable for an intermediary, such asa Reserve Bank, without any knowledge of the transaction to assume therisk of loss. Rather, this risk should be borne by the parties involved.Therefore, the Board proposes that the Reserve Banks grant credit for debititem adjustments only when they can recover credit from the originatingdepository institution.<T3>Proposals_</T3>Based on the preceding discussion, the Board of Governorsrequests public comment on the following proposals concerning the finalityof ACH transactions:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Granting finality to receivers of ACH credit transactionsat 6:30 p.m. local time on the settlement day;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Treating credits given to originators of ACH debit transactionsas final payments at 10:00 a.m. local time on the business day followingthe settlement date;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Advising receiving depository institutions with on-line connectionsto Fedwire that payments are being reversed by the time set for finalityof ACH payments;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Endeavoring to advise off-line institutions by telephonethat payments are being reversed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Reserving the right to debit the reserve/clearing accountsof institutions originating ACH credit transactions at any time duringthe settlement day; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Granting credit for debit item adjustments only when theReserve Banks can recover credit from the originating depository institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,February 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
