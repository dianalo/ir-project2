Regulators ``should ... immediately begin shrinking suchinstitutions' balance sheets in a coordinated and orderly manner,''instructs a document obtained Monday by The Associated Press.   The administration, in a 91-page strategic plan, also is tellingregulators to discourage influence-peddling by keeping a public logof all attempts by ``senior public officials'' or their staffs toinfluence their decisions.   The plan, scheduled for release by the end of the year, wasprepared by the Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board, anadministration panel headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.Brady. The board sets policy for the Resolution Trust Corp., a newentity run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an independentregulatory agency.   Under pressure from critics to increase the pace of its savingsand loan bailout, the administration plan outlines its approach tothe huge task of selling more than $300 billion in Sandamp;L assets.   As of Dec. 8, the RTC had control of 280 failed Sandamp;Ls, havingdisposed of 33 since its creation Aug. 9. It expects to getjurisdiction of at least another 220 insolvent thrifts in the next2{ years.   Most of the 33 Sandamp;L resolutions so far have involved transferringthe deposits of the failed institution to a healthy bank or Sandamp;L,leaving the government with the thrifts' bad loans and repossessedreal estate.   Critics say unless the RTC starts selling Sandamp;L assets soon, theproperties will deteriorate, driving up the taxpayer cost of thebailout.   Earlier this month, the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, agroup of university professors and other private analysts, warnedthat if the RTC continued on its present course, it could soonexhaust its available cash.   The oversight board is directing the RTC to develop a nationalprogram to sell Sandamp;L assets even before the institutions are closedor sold to new investors. As part of that, it suggested packagingand selling mortgage loans owned by the thrifts.   The plan also:   _Gives the RTC a June 30 deadline to finish reviewing thebailout deals put together by its predecessor, the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp.   _Tells the agency to ``provide financing of (real estate) assetssparingly and only when necessary.'' The financing should beconsidered a concession and be reflected in a higher purchase pricefor the property, it said. Without such financing _ in effect agovernment loan _ some analysts contend the agency won't be able tosell many properties.   _Says failed Sandamp;Ls deteriorating at the fastest rate should beclosed first, but says the agency shouldn't waste time developing aprecise priority schedule.   _Allows the RTC to sell a minority-owned thrift to anotherminority institution without opening the sale to non-minoritybidders. It permits the agency to finance the sale, at marketrates, for as long as nine months. In most cases, the RTC isforbidden from keeping an interest in institutions it sells forlonger than six months.   _Orders the agency to make public all documents spelling out theterms of bailout deals, including the estimated cost to thegovernment and the economic assumptions underlying the estimate.   Despite its length, the plan leaves a number of important issuesunresolved. For example, it tells the RTC to ``develop amechanism'' to raise additional funds to finance Sandamp;L bailouts untilit can sell thrift assets. However, it gives the agency no guidanceon the politically charged question of whether the additional fundsshould be added to the federal budget deficit.   It also gives the RTC wide latitude in deciding how to sellinsolvent Sandamp;Ls, including selling the whole institution with goodand bad assets, selling only the good assets and marketing the badassets separately, keeping all the assets for later sale, anddismantling the thrift and selling it branch by branch.</TEXT></DOC>
