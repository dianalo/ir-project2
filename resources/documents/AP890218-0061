Arnaldo Forlani was expected to be chosen to replace De Mita asparty secretary, considered by many the most powerful politicalposition in Italy. The choice could possibly endanger De Mita's10-month-old government.   De Mita, a leader of his party's left wing, called on partyleaders to avoid making the Christian Democrats a ``party ofconservatism'' and make it instead a broad-based, popular party.   ``It is not at all a personal issue but a political questionbecause the weakening, or worse, the collapse of the role ofgoverning assumed by the Christian Democrats could create a muchworse problem than the failure of a Cabinet,'' De Mita said in athree-hour speech opening the party's 18th congress this weekend.   De Mita also called Saturday for support for his government'sprograms to reduce the public deficit, improve the environment andenact reform in Italy's political system.   The Christian Democrats are the country's largest political partyand have been the main force in Italy's postwar politics. The party,which dominates the five-member governing coalition, has enormousinfluence in the shape and success of government programs.   De Mita insisted on remaining party leader when he assumed thepremiership last April, arguing it provided the government withmuch-needed stability. But other leaders have charged that too muchpower is concentrated in the premier's hands.   Forlani, 64, the only candidate for party secretary, served asItaly's premier in 1980-81 and as Christian Democrat secretary from1969-73.   For several weeks, De Mita had backed other candidates in partywrangling over his successor. However, Forlani had overwhelmingsupport from the centrist faction of the party, which controls abouta third of the 1,312 delegates, and from Giulio Andreotti, whoforeign minister and De Mita rival who controls about 20 percent ofthe delegates.   Several newspapers said Saturday that the Forlani nominationcould spell the end of De Mita's government.   ``Already the De Mita phase is coming to its conclusion and thegovernment will have rather the physiognomy of a government waitingto be definitely retired,'' the Rome-based La Repubblica said in afront-page editorial.   Many of Italy's 47 postwar governments have been brought down bydivision among Christian Democrats, even when premiers were from theparty.   The Christian Democrats currently rule in a coalition with theSocialists, Liberals, Republicans and Social Democrats.   Forlani was expected to address the congress Sunday. Although heis the only candidate for party secretary, he does not automaticallywin the post. If he does not get enough votes, delegates canconsider other candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
