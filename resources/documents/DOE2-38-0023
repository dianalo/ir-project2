Also other low energy gamma emitters like /sup234/Th, /sup 239/Np, /sup 129/I can be measured more precisely. The wholeenergy spectrum above 30 keV was covered by the high volume coaxial detectorand the 20 cm/sup 2/ planar detector. The impact of the technologicallyenhanced natural radioacivity on the human exposure was studied alongthe upper stream of the river Sava in Slovenia (YU). The low energy photonspectrometer was also useful for the rapid evaluation of the consequencesof the Chernobyl accident. 6 refs.; 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
