Comment Date: </T3>March 3, 1989.<T3>k. Description of Project: </T3>Rather than construct the intake atnortherly end of the Broad Street Dam and start the penstock from thatpoint, we propose to erect a <T3>new water diversion structure </T3>250andmin172; downstream of the BroadStreet Dam. This diversion structure will consist of two feet of permanent,concrete spillway anchored to ledge (crest elevation 508andmin172; msl) andthree feet of steel, hydraulically operated, flashboards (maximum crestelevation 511andmin172; msl).The proposed new diversion structure will divert water into a <T3>new intake structure and canal </T3>located at its northerly end. Theproposed canal will be trapezoidal in shape, be 55andmin172; wide at theintake, and extend 100andmin172; in a northeasterly direction to its 25andmin172;wide terminus. By using the route of an old canal (long since filled inwith earth), this route should provide minimal construction difficulties.<T3>New Penstock Route: </T3>At this point water will flow into a submerged,10andmin172; I.D. penstock, which will continue approximately 230andmin172;in a northeasterly direction to the existing intake at the Upper SullivanDam.From here it will turn easterly (more directly downstream) and extend anadditional 50 feet to a <T3>proposed new powerhouse </T3>(40andmin172; W x 30andmin172; L, identicalin size and layout to the powerhouse originally licensed). Again, waterfrom the turbines will discharge into a <T3>tailrace canal, </T3>with approximately the same dimensions and layoutas approved in the original license, with the major difference being thatthe proposed new powerhouse and tailrace will be located <T3>on the northerly instead of the southerly side of the sugar river.</T3>In addition, to facilitate efficient operations, we also propose tomove the installation of the 40 kW minimum flow turbine from the southerlyend of the dam to the northerly end, adjacent to the existing intake structureon the Upper Sullivan Dam. Like the minimum flow turbine originally proposed,this installation would use the same configuration of siphon inlet tubeand enclosed turbine-generator unit.The proposed changes will produce a gross head of 46.5 ft., an average<T3>net head </T3>of 43 ft. (as opposed to 50andmin172;) and generating CAPACITYin the main powerhouse of 1515 kW, in two machines of 1000 kW and 515 kWrespectively. Together with the 40 kW minimum flow unit, total capacityof 1555 kW should allow the generation of 6,000,000 kWh/year.<T3>l.
