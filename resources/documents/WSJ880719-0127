A microscopic flaw or a particle of dust can misroute or block the flow of electrical current -- a major reason the yield of usable chips from a production batch can fall as low as 25%. One of the best ways to improve those yields, however, is to repair slightly flawed chips that otherwise would be thrown out.    To make repairs easier, chip makers have begun designing &quot;redundant&quot; electrical routes into their chips through which the current can be diverted around clogged pathways. When a flaw turns up in a chip's circuitry, manufacturers use a tiny laser to cut a detour in the old path, sending the electrical current down the alternate route.    As chips become increasingly dense with circuitry, however, it becomes more difficult to repair the ever-tinier electrical routes with relatively fat and inaccurate laser beams.    Electro Scientific Industries Inc. of Portland, Ore., has introduced a laser system that it claims can test and fix a higher volume of chips than previous chip-repair systems. ESI says the beam on its new model is accurate to half a micron -- 1/200th the thickness of a human hair -- a 50% improvement over its earlier model, and small enough to repair chips with 16 times the density of today's most tightly packed chips.    `Soft X-Rays' Help Make   Smaller Semiconductors   TO HELP semiconductor makers produce ever-tinier computer chips, Hampshire Instruments Inc. has come up with &quot;a better light bulb.&quot;    The basic technique for making chips involves projecting light through transparent films, known as masks, whose images of tiny circuitry then etch themselves into wafers of light-sensitized silicon. Numerous repetitions of the procedure creates microscopically thin layers of circuits and components.    As circuits get smaller, however, the composition of the light used to project the images comes into play. If the chip features are too small, the wavelength of conventional light is too large to project the tiny image onto the silicon wafer. The solution is to come up with a light source that produces shorter wavelengths.    Researchers say the most promising source is &quot;soft X-rays,&quot; whose wavelengths are 1/300th that of visible light, and hence allow much finer detail to be projected onto silicon. A number of chip makers are building synchrotrons -- miniature nuclear particle accelerators much like those used in research physics labs -- to generate X-rays for making chips. But the machines aren't expected to be commercially available for another three years.    Meanwhile, Rochester, N.Y.-based Hampshire has developed a smaller system that uses a pulsing laser beam to induce a metallic surface into releasing X-rays. The machines, priced between $2 million and $3 million, are already in commercial production, with deliveries scheduled for next summer. Can they compete with the synchrotrons? &quot;If we do our job,&quot; says Moshe Lubin, Hampshire president and chief executive, &quot;synchrotrons will be a moot point.&quot;    Hybrid Chip Solves   Incompatibility Problem   RESEARCHERS at Texas Instruments Inc. say they have found a way for chip designers to combine the best attributes of gallium-arsenide and silicon, two materials that never used to get along.    Gallium-arsenide semiconductors, often touted as the chip of the future, are much faster than their silicon counterparts and can translate electrical signals into laser light for data transmission. But gallium-arsenide is expensive and brittle. Silicon, on the other hand, is relatively cheap, uses less power, and the industry is already proficient at packing ultradense circuits on it.    Dallas-based Texas Instruments believes a hybrid chip can be designed using gallium-arsenide components where speed is required, such as in the logic portion of the chip or for carrying data into fiber-optic cables, and densely packed silicon circuits for the memory.    To make the heretofore incompatible substances work on the same chip, Texas Instruments researchers have devised a way to embed islands of gallium-arsenide into the finished silicon chips. It's a tricky process because introducing any impurities can hinder silicon's conducting ability. While the new hybrid chips won't be commercially available soon, experts envision them as a key component in superfast computers in the 1990s that will use both highspeed fiber-optics and conventional electronics to move data.    Fiber Optics May Give   Data Centers More Room   STORAGE DEVICES that hold files of information for mainframe computers are taking up more and more floor space, creating a layout problem for data centers.    The thick wire cables that give a huge mainframe quick access to the external files can carry the heavy stream of data only about 400 feet before the signal degrades beyond use. That means companies have to keep storage equipment close to the mainframes, which can be difficult for organizations with limited available space nearby.    National Semiconductor Corp.'s National Advanced Systems unit offers a solution: &quot;optical channels,&quot; which use tiny fiber-optic cables that can carry data about 1 1/4 miles. National Advanced Systems, which markets mainframes and peripherals, says the hardware that translates data into light signals can be quickly installed in most existing models. Once that's done, up to six million pieces of information a second can fly along the optical cable from relatively distant points. </TEXT></DOC>
