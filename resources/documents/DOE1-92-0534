A major reason for seeking independence fromforeign fuel supplies was the oil crisis of 1973, so that already in1974 the French government instructed EDF to set up a programme for nuclearpower plant construction that was to ensure supply of one third of France'spower demands by nuclear electricity generation by the year 1990. Atthe time, 75% of primary energy supplies had to be imported. The standardizednuclear power plant programme set up then covered 34 units with an electricityoutput of 900 megawatt each, and 21 units of 1300 megawatt each. Theprogramme has meanwhile been adjusted to the current power demands. Thereare currently 43 PWR-type reactors in operation, generating 70% of theelectricity supplies. The remaining supplies come from hydropower orcoal, and gas or oil are practically out of electricity generation.</TEXT></DOC>
