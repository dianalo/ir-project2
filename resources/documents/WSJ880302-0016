Discounts </HL><AUTHOR> William Power (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD PET PCS MIN </IN><TEXT>   Oil prices tumbled to 10-week lows on reports that Arabian Oil Co., 20%-owned by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, has offered discounts from official OPEC prices.    The company -- 80%-owned by Japanese interests -- sold at least one cargo at $2 a barrel below the official $16.27 price that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set for oil produced in the &quot;neutral zone&quot; between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, according to analysts and industry sources. Oil prices have been depressed because of world oversupply; hints of price discounting from official prices prompts futures traders to anticipate further declines.    In Europe, the price of North Sea Brent crude oil fell 45 cents yesterday, to $14.25 a barrel. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, current-delivery crude traded as low as $15.55 a barrel before closing at $15.72, down 29 cents. The New York price rose slightly after Arabian Oil denied it was offering discounts.    Though the Arabian Oil situation doesn't involve a lot of oil, it had a big effect on the market, according to analysts, because any pricing decision involving the company must be approved by both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, two pivotal OPEC members.    &quot;So the perception is that if both of them approved it, perhaps the Saudis are relaxing their defense of the fixed-price concept,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, oil analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    The Saudis, as previously reported, have been offering discounts on their oil to U.S. companies recently, but not to Japan, which is a major importer.    Crude products also fell sharply. Current-delivery heating oil slipped 1.04 cents, to 43.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline fell 0.93 cent, to 45.29 cents a gallon.    Traders said that besides the OPEC news, energy prices were under pressure from doubts about current U.S. crude stocks. Prices tumbled last week after the Department of Energy reported an unexpected 8.5 million-barrel stockpile increase a day after the American Petroleum Institute reported a 1.9 million-barrel decrease. Part of the heavy futures selling yesterday was because of considerable speculation that API would revise its statistics upward to match the government number, Nymex traders said.    Indeed, last night API reported an almost 2%, or 5.5-million-barrel buildup in U.S. stocks, to 338.9 million barrels. Some analysts said the new figure would be bearish for today's trading.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, silver and platinum prices were mostly unchanged after rallying late Monday. Analysts said the failure to sustain the rallies provides some confirmation that the gains were essentially technical and that prices are still headed downward. Current-delivery gold on New York's Commodity Exchange gained 50 cents, to $431 an ounce; platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which soared $25.30 the day earlier, closed 30 cents lower, at $474.70 an ounce. Some analysts said since gold is so near the $400 level, many investors are staying on the sidelines until it gets even closer.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of wheat futures slipped amid news that the U.S. Agriculture Department sold more wheat than had been expected at its regular Friday auction, said Richard Loewy, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. The department sold an estimated 15.8 million bushels of wheat instead of the 10 million bushels projected by traders. The wheat market was also depressed by the absence of any new big wheat trade. The Soviet Union reportedly has finished buying the last 500,000 metric tons of the two million metric tons of subsidized wheat that the Agriculture Department offered it last month. There is growing speculation, however, that dry conditions in some parts of China might force that country into the market for more U.S. wheat. Soybean prices were mixed on profit-taking. Corn closed unchanged.    COPPER: Futures prices rose as the liquidation of March contracts abated. Anticipation of improved demand for copper in the second quarter also was a supporting factor. May-delivery copper ended at 88.2 cents a pound, up 1.9 cents. The latest report of the American Bureau of Metal Statistics showed an increase in copper supplies recently. U.S. mine production of copper in January was up 29% over a year earlier, while deliveries of refined copper by producers in the same month were down 4% from a year before, reflecting a drop in demand. Producers' inventories in the U.S. for December and January and in foreign producers' hands for November and December rose a total of 47,000 tons above year-earlier levels. Despite the modest increases, said Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, &quot;inventories still are at a critically low level and the industry is approaching its seasonally strongest consumption period -- the second quarter.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
