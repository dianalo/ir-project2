Ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had renounced the U.S. tradeagreement in February 1988, when it appeared the U.S. Congresswould not renew it because of human rights abuses by Ceausescu'sregime.   The Foreign Ministry said it was ``empowered to nullify theabusive and unilateral Feb. 29, 1988, declaration of the formerregime which gave up the granting by the U.S.A. of the most favorednation clause.''   The ministry said a decision Monday to lift all travelrestrictions on Romanians paved the way for Romania and the UnitedStates to resume the trade privileges, which exempted from somecustoms duties Romanian products arriving in the United States.   Washington granted the privileges to Romania in 1975 whenCeausescu was courted by the United States as a Communist maverick.They were tied to human rights, including free travel andemigration under the 35-nation Helsinki Final Act.   Washington increasingly grew critical of Ceausescu's suppressionof free speech, religious practice and political organization. Inbreaking the accord, the dictator said the U.S. pressure on him tohonor human rights pledges violated the principles of foreignrelations.   Ceausescu was toppled last month in a popular uprising. Theprovisional government convicted he and his wife, Elena, of ``gravecrimes'' and executed them Dec. 25.   Romania estimated the lost trade privileges cost it $250 millionin export revenues from the United States, which totaled $775million in 1987. The Romanians sell wooden furniture, smallengines, leather, textiles, gasoline and aluminium products to theUnited States.   The governing National Salvation Front also asked for diplomaticties with the European Community and membership in internationalsatellite organizations.   In Brussels, Belgium, a European Community Commission spokesmansaid the EC's external relations commissioner, Frans Andriessen,will discuss the request with Romanian authorities in Bucharest onSunday.   Romania and Albania are the only East European nations withwhich the EC has no diplomatic ties.   The state news agency Rompress said the international satelliteorganization Intelsat would allow Romania to join, and that thecountry was trying to join other such organizations.   Ceausescu had rejected Romania's membership in the organizations``because he was not interested in linking Romania to Europe andthe whole world,'' Rompres said.   The news agency also reported that leaders of a 1987 protest ofthe Ceausescu dictatorship were allowed to return from internalexile.   The leaders were deported to other parts of the countryfollowing the Nov. 15, 1987, protest in Brasov, which involved atleast 10,000 people. Rompres said 74 people returned to the truckmanufacturing enterprise in Brasov, but it was not clear how manyhad been banished.   Rompres on Tuesday also gave details from the trial of a memberof Ceausescu's security forces who was sentenced to nine years inprison in the first announced conviction resulting from militarytribunals set up by the interim government.   The defendant, identified as Ioan Bundea, a police major inSibiu, was sentenced in the Transylvanian city after being foundguilty of attempted murder, the report said.   Rompress said Bundea had opened fire on a group of five armyofficers Dec. 22 battling Ceausescu security forces, injuring oneof them.   The report, which did not provide further details, said othersuch trials were scheduled in Sibiu this week.   Captured members of security units who battled the army face amaximum life sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
