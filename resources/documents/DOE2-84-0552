The new technology offers forestrythe ability to directly transfer genetic information at any stage oftree development, or create useful biological factories or improved biologicalcontrol agents. These new techniques in conjunction with traditionalmethods can provide the means for greater efficiency in forest managementand product development. It is the USDA Forest Service's role to encourage,to develop and to test this new technology.</TEXT></DOC>
