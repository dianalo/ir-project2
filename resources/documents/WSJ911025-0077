The technology envisioned by the FCC, called video dialtone, would use telephone wires, preferably optical-fiberwires, to carry video programming and other informationservices to the home.</LP><TEXT>   Under one scenario sketched by FCC officials, consumerswould turn on their television sets to find a menu ofservices, including TV shows, movies, sports and news, thatare carried over phone lines. The programming would probablyinclude many shows already carried by cable or broadcast overthe air. One of the choices on that menu would be a packageof programs and services offered by the local phone companyitself. Consumers then would use a remote control to selectthe services they want.   The agency voted 4-0 to begin an inquiry to decide howbest to regulate the telephone video service, which has beena longtime proposal of FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, and askedfor industry comment. The technology would be &quot;aneasy-to-use, {telephone}-based way for consumers to seemultiple, competing video services,&quot; said Robert Pepper,chief of the FCC's office of plans and policy.   The implications of the technology cut across severalindustries. Telephone companies, for the first time, couldbecome effective competitors to local cable-TV companies. Andthe phone companies and other communications companies wouldbe encouraged to develop fiber-optic or other transmissiontechnology capable of carrying multiple programming. The FCChopes to put out rules in about a year.   Telephone companies are now barred by law from providingcable-TV programming. The FCC ruled that the ban doesn'tapply to long-distance phone companies. The commission alsois proposing to reinterpret its cable-TV rules to allow localphone companies to offer video programming owned by othercompanies and exempt the phone companies and videoprogrammers from having to pay cable-franchise fees.Additionally, the FCC is expected to recommend that Congressdrop its ban against telephone companies' directly owning andproviding video services.   &quot;You'd have an alternate, competitive way&quot; to get cable-TVprogramming, said Richard Firestone, chief of the FCC'scommon-carrier bureau.   James Mooney, president of the National Cable TelevisionAssociation, called the FCC proposal &quot;unfair&quot; because itexempted potential competitors from franchise fees. Inaddition, he said, he feared that the telephone companiescould subsidize their video business with profits from theirtelephone business. &quot;Until and unless the {telephonecompanies'} monopoly is ended,&quot; he said, &quot;no level ofgovernment safeguards against cross-subsidies will beeffective.&quot;   Unlike many new technologies, where regulation lags behindtechnology, the FCC clearly is ahead of the phone companies'political and business agendas. Joseph Sodolski, president ofU.S. Telephone Association, said his association was pushingfor congressional repeal of the cable-TV ban and consideredthe telephone video service insufficent. &quot;If what thecommission wants on behalf of America is investment ininfrastructure and promotion of competition, video dial toneisn't enough to get it done,&quot; he said.   Cable-TV companies often own a stake in the programmingthey carry, he said, and could deny that programming tocompanies that would transmit shows by telephone wire. &quot;Wecould have a big fiber-optic party and no one would come,&quot; hecomplained. &quot;We need a {financial} interest in programming&quot;to make sure telephone companies can get a variety of shows.   Three FCC commissioners who voted for the proposal alsoexpressed reservations that the agency may be too far aheadof industry. James Quello said he hadn't yet concluded &quot;thereis any public benefit to be derived&quot; from local phonecompanies' providing programming or forming joint ventureswith cable systems. Sherrie Marshall said that encouragingthe nationwide deployment of fiber-optic cable amounted to&quot;industrial policy of the worst kind,&quot; a kiss of death in theBush administration, which campaigns endlessly againstgovernment intervention in commercial technology.   Nevertheless, the commissioners said they went along withthe proposal because they said the agency should investigateways to increase competition. The FCC's staff, which isappointed by the agency chairman, the one unambiguouschampion of the telephone video service, tried to quell thecommissioners' concerns. Telephone companies would have tocarry any programmer that wants to use the service, theysaid, and much of the telephone company's rates would beregulated.   FCC Commissioner Ervin Duggan, though, was still worried.&quot;Having a single wire into each home, if that occurs, wouldbe not unlike having only one printing press,&quot; he said. &quot;Wemust do everything possible to ensure diversity in what iscarried over that wire.&quot;   Along with trying to promote telephone video services, theagency, by a 5-0 vote, also approved a proposal to supportso-called personal communications services, which useexperimental hand-held phones for mobile communications. Theagency said it would provide transmission channels for theseservices starting next year. The FCC has awarded about 45experimental licenses to companies that are running trials ofthe technology.   ---   Raquel Santiago contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
