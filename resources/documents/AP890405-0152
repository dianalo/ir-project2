They are also expected to reduce the number of Poles applyingfor political asylum each year, said government spokesman FriedhelmOst.   Under the measures, Polish citizens who apply for tourist visaswill be required to carry the equivalent of $27 for each day oftheir visit. Those without the required money will be turned backat the border, Ost said.   He said West German authorities would be more stringent ingranting visa requests and would deny visas to Poles previouslyinvolved in illegal activities in West Germany.   He said the new measures were aimed at discouraging Poles fromvisiting West Germany soley to earn hard currency.   West Germany is the favored destination of thousands of Poleswho sell goods that they buy cheaply in Poland or offer their laborat rates that undercut those of Germans.   Some Poles say they earn in just three months in West Germanywhat they would earn in a year in Poland.   But the new restrictions were not meant to discourage Poles fromvisiting or moving to West Germany, Ost said.   Juergen Chrobog, spokesman for the West German Foreign Ministry,said he did not know how many Poles worked illegally in WestGermany but estimated the number as ``tens of thousands.''   According to government figures, in 1988, 29,000 Poles whoentered West Germany with a tourist visa later applied forpolitical asylum. Only 2.6 percent of those applications wereapproved.</TEXT></DOC>
