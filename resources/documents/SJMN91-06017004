I've beentold that the wood should be stained.;    I thought pressure-treated woodwould last in its natural state for years -- just the way it comes from thelumber dealer.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  STAIN GIVES WOOD LONGER LIFE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO><TEXT>     A Outdoor or pressure-treated lumber is treated with chemicals to resistdecay and insect attack. This procedure permits consumers and the forestindustry to use inferior grades of lumber, rather than increasing the demandfor redwood, cedar or cypress.;    But, unlike species of timber that arenaturally decay- and insect-resistant, these lesser species have morepronounced grain, and are more prone to splinter and crack than redwood orcedar. So, even though the wood is treated, it is best to apply a stain -- orat least a water repellent -- as soon as your project is dry enough to takestain.;    The first tip for working with pressure-treated lumber is to let itdry before using it. Other woods such as redwood and cedar are dry when youbuy them. But lumber that has been treated has been injected with massiveamounts of chemicals and water. For wood that will be in ground contact, theseliquids penetrate the wood completely.;    If possible, hand pick your ownwood at the lumber dealer. Select lumber that looks straight and true, and islighter and drier to the touch. These pieces have less water content and willbe ready to use sooner.;    For very heavy lumber, understand that the extraweight you feel is fluid weight and will evaporate out in time. Stack wetlumber on a flat surface such as a driveway or patio, use spacers betweenboards to let air circulate, and check the wood for weight and by touch formoisture.;    We have let pressure-treated lumber sit for four or more weeksin 90-degree weather until it was dry enough to use without shrinking.;   When the wood is dry, it may be too hard to nail. Pre-drill holes for nails toavoid splitting the lumber. Use construction adhesives and metal connectors toreduce the number of nails or screws needed. Use only galvanized nails orcoated screws for assembly.;    Apply stain or water repellent to the &quot;down&quot;side of the lumber before you nail it in place. Joists, braces, and theunderside of deck boards will be hard to reach and finish when you have nailedthem in place.;    Q Maybe I'm all thumbs, but I have trouble getting wirenuts to hold -- even when I hold the wires in place with electrician's tape.Is it really me?;    A Your trouble in getting wire nuts to hold is that youfirst twisted the wires together before installing the nut. Electrical tape inthis case, just makes for a messy connection. To join two wires together,strip the insulation back about 3/4-inch from the wire ends. Then hold the twowires alongside and parallel to each other.;    Slip the wire nut over theends of the wires and tighten the nut. When the wire nut is tight, tug on eachwire to test the connection. Do not add electrician's tape, the wire nut willstay firmly in place on its own.;    Q Dark brown spots are appearing in areasof my concrete deck. They don't wash away with soap and water. What causesthese spots?;    A The type of discoloration you describe occurs whentricalcium alumino-ferride -- the agent that gives portland cement its graycolor -- has not reacted thoroughly with the other chemicals in concrete.;   To remove the dark spots, try pouring undiluted household vinegar. If thatdoesn't work, try a solution of 1 part muriatic acid to 30 parts water.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Popular Mechanics  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910117  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  622  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 17, 199100017004,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
