A California study, meanwhile, finds that two out of threeAlzheimer's patients are women and one in four is under 65.   ``As the U.S. population ages, the public health impact ofdementias is increasing in importance,'' the Centers for DiseaseControl said in its weekly report. An estimated 1.6 millionAmericans currently suffer from severe dementia _ most oftenAlzheimer's disease, but also some with Parkinson's disease,Huntington's chorea or dementia-inducing strokes, CDC researchersreported.   ``By the year 2000, at least 2.3 million persons are expected tobe affected,'' the Atlanta-based agency said.   The estimated annual cost of care and related expenses forpatients with severe dementia in 1985 was as much as $48 billion,the CDC said.   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder marked bydementia _ an inability to remember, reason or understand what isgoing on. The cause is unknown, and no cure is available.   A survey of 439 patients with Alzheimer's at six Californiatreatment centers from 1985-87 showed that 298, or 68 percent, werewomen, according to data from the Institute for Aging at theUniversity of California at San Francisco.   While the California patients do not represent an accuratenational survey, Alzheimer's is more frequent in women than in men,said Dr. Charles Helmick, a CDC Alzheimer's expert.   And while the disease is often regarded as an affliction of thevery old, 106 of the California patients _ or 24 percent _ wereunder 65.   ``It's been recognized it can occur in middle age,'' Helmicksaid. ``It's more prevalent among the older population, and age iscertainly a risk factor, but there are people in middle ageaffected by this.''   The largest numbers of Alzheimer's patients in the Californiastudy were in their 70s. Ages of patients ranged from 45 to 92.   Most of the California patients _ 66 percent _ were referred tothe special treatment centers by family members, most often becauseof an obvious memory problem.</TEXT></DOC>
