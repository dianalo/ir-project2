In contrast to doublestrand breaks, they showed no statistical' distribution pattern acrossthe genoma. Liquid holding experiments showed that centers sensitiveto S1-nuclease will be repaired in S. cerevisiae by a combined processof recombination and postreplication repair; the gene products of thegenes RAD50 and RAD18 are involved.</TEXT></DOC>
