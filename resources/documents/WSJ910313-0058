The federal Medicare program and private health insurersoften require physicians to get approval for surgery throughso-called precertification review in an effort to curtailprocedures considered unnecessary or inappropriate.</LP><TEXT>   The study found that criteria used to judge surgicalrecommendations vary widely across the U.S. and are often atodds with guidelines adopted by national medical groups.   &quot;The decisions of review organizations have considerableimpact on a physician's ability to care for patients,&quot; saysJohn T. Kelly, director of the office of quality assurancefor the American Medical Association. &quot;The study indicatesthat review organizations must be subjected to the samescrutiny as physicians.&quot;   Dr. Kelly and Shirley E. Kellie, also of the AMA's qualityassurance office, wrote the report, which is being publishedin today's Journal of the American Medical Association. TheAMA has long been a vocal critic of precertification programsand similar cost-control efforts it considers meddling inphysician decision-making.   The findings are based on a study of criteria used byMedicare peer review organizations for three commonprocedures, carotid endarterectomy, cataract removal andcardiac pacemaker implants. Some 48 organizations around theU.S. monitor quality and appropriateness of care for 32million Medicare recipients.   The researchers found, for instance, while mostpeer-review groups required visual acuity measurements beforeapproving cataract surgery, measurements considered asindicating surgery ranged from 20/30 to 20/300. The AmericanAcademy of Ophthalmology recommends a lower limit of 20/50.   Among patients at risk of stroke but without overtsymptoms, blockages of the carotid artery ranging from 50% to90% were found in peer-review criteria as indicating surgery.Guidelines recently adopted by the American College ofPhysicians recommend 70% as the threshold, and stress thatsurgery is appropriate only if it can be done with low riskof death or other complications. Variation for pacemakerimplants was less pronounced, the researchers found, becausemost of the peer-review groups surveyed used guidelinesapproved by the American College of Cardiology in 1984.   Dr. Kelly said the Medicare criteria were examined becausethey are publicly accessible. Health insurers use their owncriteria to judge recommended surgery, but often considerthem proprietary. The study indicates that all &quot;reviewcriteria must be publicly available and not kept secret,&quot; Dr.Kelly says. While the researchers didn't review any othercriteria, &quot;we haven't any reason to believe that thevariability we identified is limited to the PRO {peer-review}programs.&quot;   In an editorial accompanying the study, John E. Wennberg,an epidemiologist at Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, N.H.,argued that third-party guidelines generally dictate what theinsurers think is appropriate, but not what the patientprefers. He urged that guidelines and criteria be developedthat make patient preference the &quot;paramount&quot; factor indeciding what treatment is required.</TEXT></DOC>
