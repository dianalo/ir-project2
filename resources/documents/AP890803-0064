Moscow's shift was conveyed in a paper presented to U.S.Secretary of State James A. Baker III by Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze when they met last week in Paris, theofficial said.   The Soviets agreed with the U.S. position that joint inspectionsbegin before the ban is initialed by the 40-nation GenevaConference on Disarmament, said the official, a Soviet delegate tothe conference who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.   Moscow previously wanted to allow checks only after the ban wassigned, and the shift was aimed at clearing the way for earliestpossible inspections, he said. ``It is just a matter of time.Initialing comes before signing,'' the official said, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The accord must be initialed by negotiators before its formalsigning by each country's head of state.   The disarmament conference has been debating a comprehensivechemical weapons ban for more than two decades, but delegates havelittle hope of getting the draft accord ready for initialing in theimmediate future.   Disagreements at the conference include how to monitorcompliance with a future ban.   The Soviet shift in Paris was part of separate superpower talkssince 1986 on chemical weapons. The United States and Soviet Union,who have the world's biggest poison gas arsenals, say their talksmay help the 40-nation negotiations.   Both superpowers reported they agreed to on-the-spot inspectionprocedures in the latest round of bilateral talks, which ended inGeneva in late June. But they said an accord on exchanging chemicalweapons data _ which would precede the inspections _ was not readyyet. The talks are due to continue in the fall.   The Soviet official said he could not give firm predictionsabout when data exchanges or inspections may begin.   Moscow expects on-site inspections to back its official positionthat it has no more than 50,000 tons of chemical armaments. SomeWestern analysts have said the Soviet stockpile is more than sixtimes bigger.</TEXT></DOC>
