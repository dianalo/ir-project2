(PRC) in McLean, Va., said he&quot;absolutely&quot; could use the XL/doc product.andP;  Joyner has used IndexTechnology's Excelerator for analysis and design work on contracts for DODand NASA that require extensive documentation.andM;&quot;The product is designed to handle the documentation standards for 2167A, andit does it very well,&quot; Joyner said.andM;XL/Doc includes such features as boilerplate text insertion, automaticparagraph numbering, table of contents generation, external file inclusionand automatic table creation.andP;  The product can be customized to conform toother government documentation standards, such as those within NASA, theFederal Aviation Administration and the Army's 7935A documentation standard,company officials said.andM;The product also can be made to conform to Federal Information ProcessingStandard 38, known as Guidelines for Documentation of Computer Programs andAutomated Data Systems.andM;PRC's Joyner said he likes XL/doc's flexibility and its languageindependence.andP;  Joyner said he has used Excelerator on FORTRAN, Pascal and Adasoftware development projects, as well as on a database engineering projectusing the Structured Query Language.andM;Index Technology has tightly integrated XL/Doc with the Exceleratordictionary to ensure consistency, company officials said.andP;  If a change ismade in the system's requirements, analysis or design, any new documentautomatically will reflect the change.andM;The product also contains document tables that trace systems specificationsback to the original engineering requirements.andM;Under a licensing agreement with XL/Doc's developer.andP;  Solutron Inc. ofAlameda, Calif., Index Technology has exclusive rights to market and sell theproduct, which sells for $7,900.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
