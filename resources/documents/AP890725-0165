Bloch.   Newt Gingrich, the GOP whip in the House, said after a WhiteHouse meeting with President Bush that the FBI'scounterintelligence capabilities had been weakened over the past 15years, along with U.S. ability ``to know exactly what the KGB isdoing.''   The Georgian added: ``I think that as people look at that case,there is going to be a very serious effort to rethink how much _how much resources do we need to put into counterintelligenceactivities and to what degree do we have to strengthen thatcapability. It's obviously a very serious concern.''   The Soviets, meanwhile, were showing extraordinary interest inthe investigation of the 54-year-old diplomat, even tailing him andthe FBI to New York.   The unusual Soviet surveillance shows ``they have a lot investedin this,'' said a government source familiar with the case.   The United States cautioned the Soviet Union against trying tosmuggle Bloch out of the country, it was learned Monday evening.The warning came weeks before news organizations reported that the30-year career diplomat was suspected of spying.   Even so, Bloch and a caravan of FBI agents were followed bySoviet Embassy personnel on Saturday from Washington to a New YorkCity suburb, the government source said.   Still, the former No. 2 official in the U.S. Embassy in Viennawas not arrested. Several officials suggested the government wastrying to bolster its case against Bloch, and even hoped theSoviets would try to establish contact with him.   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said thedepartment ``has had no contact with the Soviets regarding theBloch investigation.'' But she declined to say whether Moscow hadbeen cautioned against trying to smuggle Bloch out of the country.   The embattled diplomat was suspended from his job as director ofthe Office of Regional Political-Economic Affairs on June 22 andsurrendered his diplomatic passport. But no restrictions wereimposed on his travels by the State Department.   The Bloch investigation centers on the eight years he served inVienna, first as an economic officer and then, from 1981 to 1987,as deputy chief of mission.   Senior U.S. officials said Bloch would have had access in thedeputy ambassador's post to all messages that passed betweenWashington and the Vienna embassy.   ``The Central Intelligence Agency would have a responsibility tokeep him informed,'' said an official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity. ``And he would know about arms transfers.''   In addition, officials have said Bloch participated in adecision announced by the Commerce Department last week to allowthe sale of a broad range of personal computers to the Soviet Unionand Eastern-bloc countries.   Austria, as a neutral country, is not bound by the restrictionsthe United States, other Western countries and Japan impose ontechnology sales.   To try to prevent security-sensitive sales, the U.S. Embassy inVienna, acting on instructions from Washington, tries to dissuadethe Austrians from permitting questionable deals to go through,officials said.   The officials stressed that Bloch probably had a larger role toplay in embassy issues because he served under two political _rather than career _ ambassadors, Helene Von Damm and Ronald Lauder.   Gingrich's suggestion that U.S. counterintelligence needed to bebuilt up _ and a suggestion he might use the defense bill nowbefore Congress to accomplish that end _ got a mixed reception atthe White House.   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush also was concernedabout the government's capabilities. But, the spokesman said, ``wedon't advocate any specific changes at this point.''</TEXT></DOC>
