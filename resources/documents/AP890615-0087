Pat Swindall's perjury trial,jurors heard him in tape-recorded conversations with an undercoveragent.   That's all they're going to hear from him.   Swindall's lawyers rested their case Wednesday without puttingthe former congressman on the stand.   The case is expected to go to the jury Friday, following closingarguments.   Because he won't be taking the stand, Swindall will not facecross-examination by prosecutor Craig Gillen, who questionedSwindall for hours on Feb. 2, 1988, before a federal grand juryabout an $850,000 loan deal.   Prosecutors said that among other things, Swindall lied duringhis testimony that day when he denied being told by an agent posingas a money launderer that some of the loan money might have comefrom drug trafficking.   Swindall, 38, faces up to 45 years in prison. The two-termRepublican from the Atlanta suburbs lost his congressional seat toDemocrat Ben Jones in November.   The indictment specifies 23 alleged lies, grouped into ninecounts of perjury. Fourteen other alleged lies were dismissed byU.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman or dropped by the prosecutionfor reasons of clarity.   The prosecution won a victory today when the judge said he willtell the jury that only one deliberate lie is sufficient for aconviction on any one count.   He also said he will instruct the jury that Swindall's failure totestify on his own behalf should not be considered in jurydeliberations.   The trial was nearly aborted Wednesday after Gillen asked adefense witness, lawyer Bobby Lee Cook, about what motivatesdefendants to testify.   Gillen asked whether it was correct that ``if a defendant were totestify and he knew certain things ... could help him ... he wouldbe more prone to testify in that regard?''   Swindall attorney Tom Thrash immediately asked Freeman to declarea mistrial, arguing that the question planted in the jurors' mindsthe thought that if Swindall did not testify, it would be because hehad something to hide.   Freeman denied the mistrial motion, and instructed the jury thatSwindall's failure to testify _ which is his right _ should not beheld against him in any way.</TEXT></DOC>
