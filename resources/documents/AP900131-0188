(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jurors on Wednesday found Paula Marie Simseligible for the death penalty for the murder of her 6-week-olddaughter, and now must decide whether to sentence her to death bylethal injection.   A red-eyed Mrs. Sims, who contends a masked gunman abductedHeather Lee Sims last year as well as her firstborn daughter in1986, displayed no reaction when the decision was announced.   The Madison County Circuit Court jury, which deliberated abouttwo hours, will hear further arguments before considering whetherto impose the death penalty or a lesser sentence.   This third phase of the trial begins Thursday, and will centeron any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, said AssistantMadison County State's Attorney Donald Weber.   Weber and defense attorney Donald Groshong both declined tocomment on Wednesday's decision.   Weber argued Wednesday that the death penalty was warranted inthe April 29 suffocation of Heather Lee Sims because the slayingwas planned and the crime was ``cruel, brutal, grossly ruthless anddevoid of mercy and compassion.''   Under Illinois law, prosecutors may seek the death penalty undercertain circumstances, including cases in which the victim is under12 years old and the killing is particularly brutal, or in whichthere are multiple victims.   Mrs. Sims, 30, of Alton contends a masked gunman abductedHeather Lee and, three years earlier, 13-day-old Loralei.   No murder charges have been filed in Loralei's death, but Mrs.Sims faces trial in Jersey County on charges of obstruction ofjustice and concealment of a homicide in connection with the death.   Mrs. Sims continues to maintain her innocence, Groshong told thepanel Wednesday.   But he also argued, ``We cannot say the death of this child waspremeditated, prolonged or torturous. ... In the pecking order ofevil ... smothering is usually considered more merciful than otherforms of killing.''   The jury Tuesday found Mrs. Sims guilty of first-degree murder,obstructing justice and concealing a homicide in Heather Lee'sdeath.   Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert, reported Heather abductedApril 29 from their home. Her body was found May 3 in a trashbarrel across the Mississippi River in nearby West Alton, Mo. Anautopsy indicated she had been suffocated and that her body wasthen frozen.</TEXT></DOC>
