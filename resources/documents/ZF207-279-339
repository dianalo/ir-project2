Carlucci had imposed a 2 percent limit on realgrowth for fiscal 1990, but congressional sources said that figure was toohigh in view of the deficit.andP;  Don Richbourg, staff director of the HouseAppropriations defense Subcommittee, said many DOD officials think the 2percent rate is unrealistically low.andM;Another congressional source said, &quot;No one believes they will actually getthe 2 percent real growth that was budgeted.andP;  The consensus on the Hill isthat they will be lucky to get zero percent.&quot;andM;DOD officials, however, said they expect ADP spending to be strong underBush.andP;  William Leary, director of review and control for the DOD comptroller,said, &quot;Overall, IRM funding continues to be strong and is slightly upcompared to last year.andP;  There aren't any obvious big increases or decrease.andO;It is a realistic budget for IRM.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
