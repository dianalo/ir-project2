Using parallel processing rulemaking procedures, EPAproposed approval of a conditional Plan Approval issued by the MassachusettsDepartment of Environmental Protection (DEP) which imposes VOC controlmethods as RACT for Spalding Sports Worldwide Corporation (Spalding) locatedin Chicopee, Massachusetts. This final rulemaking action approves the formalSIP revision submitted by the DEP on July 18, 1989.This notice is divided into three parts:<ITAG tagnum="25">I.

Background Information</ITAG>On November 9, 1983 (48 FR 51488) EPA approved Massachusetts Regulation310 CMR 7.18(17), ``Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT),'' aspart of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1982 ozone attainment plan. Thisregulation requires the Massachusetts DEP to determine and impose RACTon all facilities with the potential to emit one hundred tons per year(TPY) or more of VOC that are not already subject to Massachusetts' regulationsdeveloped pursuant to the EPA Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents.On February 4, 1988 the Massachusetts DEP submitted a SIP revision forparallel processing. This SIP revision was composed of a Plan Approvalfor Spalding which defined VOC control requirements as RACT. On February10, 1989, EPA proposed approval of the Plan Approval with the understandingthat the DEP would amend it as outlined in the NPR prior to final rulemaking.On July 18, 1989, the DEP formally submitted an amended Plan Approval datedJuly 12, 1989, which amends the original Plan Approval and incorporatesall the provisions required by EPA's NPR.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of SIP Revision Including the Changes Made To Secure FinalEPA Approval</ITAG>Spalding is a non-CTG source. The SIP revision for this source includesa Plan Approval dated October 7, 1985 and an Amendment to that Plan Approvaldated July 12, 1989 requiring RACT on four processes at Spalding that arenot covered by a CTG. The DEP has calculated that VOC emissions at Spaldingwere reduced from 541.2 TPY to 126.3 TPY (a 76.7% reduction) during thetime period which RACT was imposed. The emission reductions achieved fromeach process are discussed in the Technical Support Document prepared forthis action.RACT is being imposed for four processes, including the manufacture andcoating of golf balls, and inflated balls as well as for miscellaneouscleaning operations. The details of each RACT requirement were outlinedin the NPR and will not be restated here. EPA's NPR required that fiveissues be addressed in the Plan Approval prior to final rulemaking. Howthe DEP's July 12, 1989 Plan Approval satisfies the issues of the NPR issummarized below.(1) The July 12, 1989 amended Plan Approval requires explicit emissionlimits in pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (minus water and photochemicallynonreactive solvents) for each coating/painting manufacturing process.The July 12, 1989 amended Plan Approval states that EPA-approved ReferenceMethod 24 shall be used to determine compliance.(2) The calculation method to determine compliance is attached to the July12, 1989 amended Plan Approval as the RACT equivalency worksheet. Thisworksheet facilitates calculation of the actual pounds of VOC per gallonof coating (minus water) for comparison with the RACT limit.(3) The July 12, 1989 amended Plan Approval requires that four metal partscleaning units be installed and operated in accordance with the manufacturer'sspecifications. These new cleaning units will emit fewer VOC's when properlyoperated.(4) The DEP has made four minor changes to the Plan Approval, as requestedin the NPR.(5) The July 12, 1989 amended Plan Approval includes the recordkeepingsheets that Spalding must maintain on a daily basis.No public comments were received on the NPR. Other specific requirementsof the RACT determination and the rationale for EPA's proposed action areexplained in the NPR and will not be restated here. Since the DEP has addressedeach of the issues raised in the NPR, EPA is approving the Plan Approvalsas an amendment to the Massachusetts SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

This SIP revision was composed of a Plan Approval dated June30, 1987 for Duro which defined VOC control requirements as RACT. On August16, 1988, EPA proposed approval of the Plan Approval with the understandingthat the DEP would amend it as outlined in the NPR prior to final rulemaking.On August 8, 1989, the DEP formally submitted Amended Plan Approvals datedAugust 1, 1989 and August 8, 1989, respectively which supercede the June30, 1987 Plan Approval and incorporate all the provisions required by EPA'sNPR.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Summary of SIP Revision Including the Changes Made to Secure FinalEPA Approval</ITAG>Duro's emissions have been reduced from 148.5 tons per year of VOC in 1980to 39 tons per year, resulting in a 74 percent reduction based on typicalproduction. Duro achieved its emission reductions through process changesand reformulation of its inks. The DEP's Amended Plan Approvals enforceablyrequire these changes and the use of the reformulated inks. The amendedPlan Approvals also require that Duro only use rotary screen printers.In the June 30, 1987 Plan Approval, the DEP had imposed a daily emissionscap on Duro such that VOC emissions would not exceed 0.156 tons per day(312 pounds per day). In the NPR, EPA stated that the DEP RACT Plan Approvalmust also impose an emission limit on each of Duro's inks to be met atall times.The DEP's Amended Plan Approvals satisfy the NPR's requirement for fabricprinting because those Amended Plan Approvals limit each of Duro's inkto 0.5 pounds of VOC per pound of solids.As discussed in the NPR, fabric printing is similar to graphic arts. OnSeptember 9, 1987, a memorandum from Darryl D. Tyler, Director of the ControlPrograms Development Division of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning andStandards, suggested that an emission limit of 0.5 pounds of VOC per poundof solids would be equivalent to RACT for flexographic and packaging rotogravureprinting industries. While this emission limit was not intended to be imposedon rotary screen fabric printing operations, Duro's production on rotaryscreens must replicate the quality of product achieved on roller printersno longer in use. Duro's inks have been substantially reformulated to meetthis emission limit. Further, the emission reductions achieved by Duro,through process changes and reformulation is consistent with the reductionsanticipated for either add-on controls or through reformulation at facilitiesrequired to meet the emission limits suggested by EPA's Graphic Arts CTG.For all of the above reasons, the DEP has imposed an emission limit of0.5 pounds of VOC per pound of solids and an emissions cap (312 poundsper day) which, together, ensure that a 74 percent reduction in emissionsis achieved each day at Duro.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Final Action</ITAG>For all of the above reasons, EPA is approving the Amended Plan Approvalsdated and effective August 1, 1989 (SM-85-168-IF) and August 8, 1989 (SM-85-168-IFRevision) as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA is approving Massachusetts' Amended Plan Approvals dated and effectiveAugust 1, 1989 (SM-85-168-IF) and August 8, 1989 (SM-85-168-IF Revision)as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP.
