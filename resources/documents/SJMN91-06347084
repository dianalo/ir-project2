But whether this commonwealth will fillthe political vacuum will turn on its ability to attract other republics. Themost critical remaining republic is Kazakhstan with its 16 million people anda territory almost seven times that of California.;   The Bush administrationis particularly enamored of Kazakhstan because it is one of the few republicsthat has not acted riotously to jettison the past. Rather, led by itspresident Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan has plotted a moderate path todemocracy and a free market.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A CRUCIAL PIECE: KAZAKHSTAN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary; Keith A.

Nazarbayev received an overwhelming mandate,more than 98 percent of the vote.;   Kazakhstan is a remote Central Asianrepublic, but positioned strategically between Russia and China, and within acouple of hundred miles of Afghanistan and Iran. Unlike the three members ofthe new commonwealth, Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia, no one ethnic grouppredominates in Kazakhstan.;   There are almost equal numbers of Russians andKazakhs, and large concentrations of Germans, Koreans, and Ukrainians.;  Kazakhstan's promise lies in its ability to maintain the delicate harmony in aheterogeneous population. Last month's celebration of the October BolshevikRevolution in the capital shows the balance Kazakhstan is trying to maintainbetween the conservative forces and the emerging new generation offorward-looking leaders.;   As in previous years, red banners celebrating theOctober Revolution decorated the streets of the capital, Alma Ata. As a meagergesture to old-line communists, a very brief goose-stepping guard appearedoutside the parliament building. But the communist slogans had disappeared,and the grand parades with their displays of military prowess were gone.;  The city creatively transformed the day into a celebration for TokhtarAubakirov, the first Kazakh cosmonaut. A crowd of about 15,000 -- small bycomparison with the obligatory appearances of prior years -- showed up tohonor Aubakirov and to watch dancers in exotic ethnic dress.;   A streetadjoining the celebration was once called Stalin Street; but with Stalin'sdisgrace, the name was changed to Communist Street. &quot;Now we'll have to changethe name once again,&quot; observed a parliament member.;   But the roots ofcommunism still run deep. Although Nazarbayev dissolved the Communist Party inKazakhstan in the wake of the failed August coup, Kazakhstan State Universitystill proudly carries the sign over its entrance: &quot;Learn According to thePrecepts of Lenin!&quot; Pictures of Lenin decorate the offices of many members ofparliament.;   But even the most ardent communists appear resigned to change.Indeed, concern runs high in liberal circles that the former privileged elitewill continue to rule Kazakhstan under the guise of capitalism rather thancommunism.;   Like the other republics of the former Soviet Union, Kazakhstanfaces huge challenges. The central authorities ran the republic from Moscow,failing to nurture a local bureaucracy. The Russian Republic's government hasselected the best of the former central administration, keeping for itself theexperienced administrative staffs. Russia will continue to function with thiswell-developed bureaucracy in place. But with little experience, the otherrepublics must develop their own tools of governance.;   Kazakhstan hasundertaken to meet this challenge with Nazarbayev leading the charge. Once apuppet of the Communist Party, the Kazakhstan parliament is working vigorouslyon new legislative initiatives to stabilize the economy and attract foreigninvestment. A commodity exchange opened earlier this year. The formerCommunist Party school has been transformed into a business school. Businessand commerce are starting to jell.;   Despite Kazakhstan's vast potential, thepresidents of Byelorussia, Russia and the Ukraine omitted Nazarbayev from theguest list for their talks last weekend to establish the new commonwealth --possibly because of Nazarbayev's close relationship with Gorbachev.;  Nevertheless, their failure to invite Kazakhstan may cast doubt on theirstatement that they would admit other republics that agreed with their aimsand principles. Kazakhstan will probably set its own pace this week, decidingwhether to cast its lot with the new Commonwealth of Independent States. Thepolitical reality dictates that Kazakhstan should join, and it would be wiseto do it now. The ability of the commonwealth to gain wide acceptance in theWest would be greatly enhanced.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KEITH A.
