The Targeted Export Assistance (TEA) program was launched in 1986 to boost food exports, and House and Senate appropriations committee conferees are now considering raising the program's budget from $110 million in 1988 to $330 million in 1989. But the TEA program epitomizes the absurdity of U.S. agricultural policy and the arrogance of U.S. trade policy.    Under the TEA program the Agriculture Department is paying for foreign advertisements for Samuel Adams beer, Paul Newman gourmet sauces, Moyle Mink furs, Celestial Seasonings tea, Chateau San Michel wine, Kroger grocery items, Blue Diamond almonds, and Sunkist oranges and lemons.    Yet some of the American groups receiving federal funds for foreign advertising are actively impeding American exports. The Agriculture Department gave $4 million to the California Almond Growers Exchange for foreign promotions, for example -- even though the exchange controls the Agriculture Department's Almond Board, which is prohibiting American farmers from exporting more than 100 million pounds of almonds this year in an effort to drive up world almond prices. And Sunkist received $17 million -- even though Sunkist publicly urged Japan not to remove its import quotas on American citrus. (Sunkist had a lock on the Japanese market and didn't want competition.)    What's worse, the TEA program is trying to boost exports of products that other Agriculture Department programs sabotage:   --It has spent $25 million to boost raisin exports, even though byzantine Agriculture Department restrictions are deterring the export of 100 million pounds of California raisins.    --The National Peanut Council received $11 million to boost peanut exports at the same time that the Agriculture Department prohibits the export of unsubsidized American peanut butter to Canada.    --The Chocolate Manufacturers Association received $5 million, even though chocolate exports are repressed because the government drives domestic sugar prices to triple or quadruple world prices.    --The National Sunflower Council received $3 million, even though sunflower exports have plummeted largely because lavish federal subsidies encouraged farmers to grow fewer sunflowers and more (surplus) wheat.    --Tobacco Associates received $1.3 million in tax dollars to boost American cigarette exports at the same time that the surgeon general is trying to reduce domestic cigarette consumption.    The TEA program is designed to counter the effects of foreign trade barriers against American agriculture exports. But as a recent General Accounting Office report noted, the Agriculture Department considers almost any barrier to American exports as unfair, even though the U.S. itself is notorious for strict import barriers on foreign food.    Nor does the program work to lower the trade barriers. Instead, it provides federal subsidies for American companies to seize larger market shares in countries that in some cases have no trade barriers and have committed no offense against American industry.    Critics have derided the TEA program as &quot;throwing money at exports.&quot; Indeed, the Agriculture Department has been far more concerned with spending money than in getting results, and until recently did not even require much evaluation of how the funds were spent. When pressed to require more solid evaluations, as the General Accounting Office noted in a May report, the Agriculture Department &quot;warned against overregulation and said that different commodities, markets and activities demanded different evaluation techniques.&quot; The department apparently considers it an invasion of corporate privacy to ask recipients what they did with their grants.    The TEA program epitomizes Congress's approach to trade problems in the massive Omnibus Trade Bill. Congress is attempting to solve the trade problem not by reducing the regulations, taxation and budget deficits that hurt American business productivity and efficiency, but by adopting definitions of unfair trade that include anything and everything, promising massive retaliation against foreign exporters, and spending more billions on ineffective government programs such as the Overseas Private Investment Corportion, the Small Business Administration, the Export-Import Bank, and Trade Adjustment Assistance.    There is no excuse for government to reduce American productivity and then to squander tax dollars to hide the damage caused by foolish government policies. The TEA program is a symbol of the incompetence of Congress and the Agriculture Department in dealing with world markets.    ---   Mr. Bovard, an associate analyst at the Cato Institute, wrote on agricultural export subsidies for the Journal in February. </TEXT></DOC>
