Mr. Tanaka was convicted in 1983 for taking bribes from Lockheed Corp. to use his influence to persuade All Nippon Airways to buy Lockheed Tristar jets. Yesterday's ruling sustained his four-year prison sentence and upheld the convictions of four lesser defendants. Mr. Tanaka was accused of receiving about $1.7 million in payoffs while in office between 1972 and 1974.    Mr. Tanaka remained free on bail, and his attorneys said they are appealing to the Supreme Court. In view of the extremely slow pace of the criminal justice system in Japan, it's unlikely that Mr. Tanaka, who is 69 years old and ailing, will spend time in prison.    The ruling's lack of major political impact has much to do with the fact that the Tanaka faction in parliament was dissolved July 4, when Noboru Takeshita, the Liberal Democratic Party's general secretary and a former Tanaka protege, broke loose. Mr. Takeshita, a leading candidate to succeed Yasuhiro Nakasone as prime minister in October, founded his own faction within the ruling party after a protracted intra-factional dispute and took with him 113 of the 141 members of the Tanaka faction.    For many years, Mr. Tanaka was the most powerful man in Japan. He resigned as prime minister in 1974 amid accusations of unethical fund-raising methods. That scandal was unrelated to the Lockheed case, which surfaced in 1976.    One political consequence of the High Court's decision could be a threat to Mr. Tanaka's seat in parliament stemming from an opposition demand, which was renewed yesterday, that the lower house's ethics committee review his case. But calls for Mr. Tanaka's resignation have gone unheeded in the past. </TEXT></DOC>
