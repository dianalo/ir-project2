EEC External Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq said in astatement the bill confirmed a U.S. tendency ``to interpretinternational trading rules unilaterally.''   ``The Community stands ready to defend its legitimate interestseach time these are threatened by unilateral measures ... by U.S.authorities on the basis of the trade bill,'' he said.   De Clercq said he would seek an ``adequate'' EEC response to thebill when the EEC Foreign Ministers meet here Sept. 26.   De Clercq said the EEC had trade rights in the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade, the international trade organization, andthat it will ``defend them if necessary.''   President Reagan signed the trade bill into law on Tuesday.   Among others things, it gives U.S. negotiators more bargainingroom at international trade talks, boosts U.S. ability to fightrestrictive trade policies of other nations and allows thepresident to block foreign investments if these are seen to impairU.S. national security.   The EEC objects to portions of the bill including a sectionraising retaliatory powers in trade and to the extension for twoyears of the Export Enhancement Program. The program pays surplusfarm commodities from government bins to exporters to boostoverseas sales. The program has a price tag of $2.5 billion.   A Commission spokesman said the EEC ``will check, on acase-by-case basis, to see how the bill is implemented but we firstwant a reaction from the member states.''   He noted that the bill's contents clashed with PresidentReagan's strong views on free trade guarantees.   The president signed the bill and, in a speech, acknowledged``it could lead to an import fee that would be illegal according tointernational law and inconsistent with our goal of moving toward afree world trade.''   In his statement, De Clercq said the United States had declaredat the Toronto summit of industrialized nations in June that``nations must continue to resist protectionism and the temptationto adopt unilateral measures.''   The EEC also was party to the declaration.</TEXT></DOC>
