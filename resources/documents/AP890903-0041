He had started the day at St. Ann's Episcopal Church where theRev. Laman H. Bruner Jr., after his own sermon, turned the pulpitover to the president, who told his fellow parishioners he was readyfor the end of summer.   ``Tomorrow it starts all over again,'' said Bush. ``I don't knowwhat you guys have to do, but I know what I've got to do: head backto work.''   Like a student beginning the new school year after Labor Day,Bush said he needed to ``start studying hard'' for the drug speechhe will deliver to the nation Tuesday night.   ``It's the first speech I'll give from the Oval Office. I'm notgoing to be scared,'' said Bush, who began the talk recalling how asa young child he would shake when called upon to recite a verseduring the summer services at St. Ann's.   Bush spoke of the signs of faith he has encountered in communistlands, and said, ``We're living in a time of real hope.''   He exhorted young people ``to involve yourselves in the lives ofothers. ... Do what you can to strengthen community life.''   ``Indeed, I'll be asking our country to do that'' as part of theanti-drug strategy, Bush said.   ``Remember, don't ever forget that we are one nation under God,''said Bush, who was joined at the service by Barbara, his motherDorothy Walker Bush and other relatives.   Then, after a fast change of clothes, it was out to sea in hisspeedboat Fidelity with wife Barbara, son Marvin and nationalsecurity adviser Brent Scowcroft.   ``What a day,'' said Bush, who had vowed to end his dry fishingspell before returning to the White House on Monday after 20 dayshere at the family's oceanfront retreat. ``It was a long, drysummer, but it all worked out.   ``It's what we call `stick-to-it-ivness','' said the president,holding the glistening fish aloft with one hand as he steered theboat to the dock with the other. ``A tremendous fish. ... a verystrong fish.'' He estimated it weighed ``nine or 10 pounds.''   He said they had been led to the magic spot by some birdscircling overhead.   There was no weigh-in, for Bush personally cleaned and filletedthe fish immediately upon docking.   ``We're just going to get the steak,'' he said, tossing fishentrails into the cove waters. ``This is nature, return to nature,''he said, ``because in about two hours you'll see the gulls in herepicking this guy clean.''   Bush performed the operation on a plastic bag, saving the head``for soup.''   Bush got his bluefish after only a few minutes in the water atthe outset of a 2{-hour expedition. They caught nothing else.   ``My boy Marvin was steering the boat at the time. He did aheckuva job. And as for General Scowcroft and Bar, they werealong,'' he said.   Bush, who prides himself on his fishing abilities, had become thebutt of jokes, including a Portland Press Herald ``No Fish''insignia that became a best-selling T-shirt.   Bush went golfing later Sunday, and planned one final fishingouting Monday morning before flying back to Washington early in theLabor Day holiday afternoon.</TEXT></DOC>
