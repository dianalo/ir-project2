The conviction Friday of corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian,whose bushy mustache and bargain basement suits belied his businessworld clout, marked a number of firsts in a three-year federalcrackdown on Wall Street crime.   It was the first guilty verdict delivered by a jury in a casecentering on criminal securities fraud charges.   It was the first time stock ``parking,'' in which parties try toconceal the sale or transfer of securities, was prosecuted as afelony.   It was the first time information spun off from the Ivan Boeskyinsider trading scandal _ via Los Angeles stockbroker turnedgovernment informant Boyd L. Jefferies _ yielded a conviction.   ``We will continue to prosecute any case that's appropriate toprosecute. and if that includes parking violations, then so be it,''said U.S. Attorney Benito Romano.   Wall Street lawyers said the swift conviction _ the Bilzerianjury deliberated just eight hours _ should buoy the government in aseries of scheduled trials, including the racketeering and fraudcase against bond mogul Michael Milken.   ``It does give them some momentum and embolden them to continueother prosecutions,'' said a New York securities defense lawyer whoasked not to be identified.   The government was stymied earlier this year with two mistrialsin its other top case at U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the stockmanipulation and wire fraud trial of GAF Corp. and a top executive.A jury deliberated 12 days before the second mistrial was declared.   ``The fact of the matter is it just shows that the GAF case wasan aberration and that it bodes ill for Milken and that ilk goingforward in the future,'' the securities attorney said.   Defense lawyers believed the Bilzerian jury could have gottenlost in a morass of details it couldn't grasp, which has long been afear of the government in prosecuting complex stock market-relatedfrauds.   But courtroom observers said the government presented a strongcase _ and that Bilzerian, testifying in his own defense, failed toexonerate himself by admitting he supplied misleading information tothe Securities and Exchange Commission.   The 38-year-old Singer Co. chairman and corporate takeoverspecialist was found guilty on nine counts of breaking securitiesand tax laws and making false statements in connection with threefailed takeovers and one other transaction in 1985 and '86. He facesup to 45 years in jail and $2.25 million in fines.   The conviction on the stock parking charges broke new legalground, attorneys said. Parking, typically done to dodge tax ordisclosure laws, is not defined anywhere as a crime, but is lumpedwith other actions that may be used to violate federal securitieslaws.   Many defense lawyers had argued that the government wasstretching the law by seeking to prosecute the activity criminally.The jury's verdict proved them wrong.   ``It certainly removes any illusion that parking is an inncocuousactivity,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a New York securities lawyer.``It does underline that parking activities will be viewed veryseriously by federal regulators and they can make it stick.''   Parking violations are included in the civil and criminal casesagainst Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the racketeering and fraudindictments of Princeton-Newport Partners LP and Drexel financierMilken.   ``I still believe that despite the conviction it was not the kindof case that should have been prosecuted criminally,'' securitiesdefense lawyer Stanley Arkin said. ``I certainly hope it's not aprecedent.''   Finally, the conviction marked success in a case derived from thesnowballing information provided by Boesky, who paid $100 million tosettle insider trading charges in 1986 and named names.   Boesky had told government prosecutors about Jefferies, whosetestimony was central to the GAF trial but was contradicted severaltimes. In the Bilzerian case, he was viewed as more credible.Jefferies is to testify in the GAF retrial and another fraud caselater this year.   The government's only other victory in a case tied to the WallStreet scandals was the perjury conviction in March of Drexelassistant bond trader Lisa Jones, who lied during thePrinceton-Newport inquest but wasn't charged with violatingsecurities laws.</TEXT></DOC>
