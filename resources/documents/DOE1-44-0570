<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0570 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two-dimensional numerical simulations have been carried out in order tostudy the injection and propagation of a nonrelativistic electron beamfrom a spacecraft into a fully ionized plasma in a magnetic field. Contraryto the earlier results in one dimension, a high-density electron beamwhos density is comparable to the ambient density can propagate intoa plasma. A strong radial electric field resulting from the net chargesin the beam causes the beam electrons to spread radially, reducing thebeam density. When the injection current exceeds the return current,significant charging of the spacecraft is observed along with the accelerationof the ambient electrons back to the spacecraft. As a result, a beamcurrent much larger than the thermal return current can be injected intospace. Recent data on the electron beam injection from the Spacelab 1(SEPAC) are discussed. copyright American Geophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
