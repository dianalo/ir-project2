Adams as the House subcommitteeon employment and housing began hearings to investigate the troubledprogram.   ``We concluded that inappropriate lender underwriting practicescaused inflated mortgages,'' as early as November 1985, Adams said.   But he said HUD managment criticized him for overstating theproblems and rejected controls he suggested as too strict. However,he said officials kept assuring him they were taking steps to``improve lender monitoring processes and enforcement actions.''   Meanwhile:   _In Montgomery, Ala., federal attorneys are looking intoallegations that a Montgomery real estate broker kept more than $2million that he was supposed to send to HUD, spending nearly$180,000 on cars.   _In Washington, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said ``The wholenation is appalled _ in fact, sickened _ by the revelations of thelooting'' at HUD during the Reagan administration.   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is scheduled to appear July 12 beforethe House banking committee which Gonzalez heads to discuss reformmeasures being instituted.   In the Senate, one staffer said Senate banking committee chairmanDonald Riegle, D-Mich., has sent a letter to panel members seekingauthorization for an investigation. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,chairman of the subcommittee on housing, said Friday he would votefor a probe of the ``scandal-ridden'' department.   In a separate matter, Kemp late Thursday cancelled a $500 millionmortgage loan guarantee program that helped finance such things asstreet construction and sewer lines for smaller developers whoincluded low- and moderate-income housing in their projects.   The department found that nearly half of the 58 projects financedthrough the program had defaulted on loans and cost the government$90 million.   ``This program was an absolute disaster, said HUD spokesman BobNipp.   The coinusrance mortgage program was started in 1983 as ahallmark of Reagan administration efforts to ``privitize'' manygovernment programs.   Under the program, private lenders offer loans for the repair,rehabilitation or construction of low- and moderate-incomemultifamily housing.   Lenders are paid an annual fee of about 4 percent of a project'soperating income. If a loan defaults, lenders are responsible forabout 20 percent of the loss while HUD picks up the tab for theremaining 80 percent.   ``Claims filed against HUD as of September 1988 total over $100million, with more claims expected in the next several months,''said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman.   In his most recent program audit in March 1989, Adams found onelender, Benton Mortgage Company, of Knoxville, Tenn., hadmisrepresented mortgage amounts and rents on 14 projects it hadunderwritten.   Adams estimated Benton's mortgages were excessive by $22 million.He also said the government would pay excessive rent subsidies of$37 milllion over the 15-year period of contracts for rental housingBenton had coinsured.   Benton is one of three companies which has been placed on asix-month probation from the program. Three companies have beensuspended indefinitely and three others are under ``close watch''review by HUD, Adams said.   Adams revealed Friday that Benton is the subject of a grand juryinvestigation.   When Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., asked Adams whether he wasinvestigating relationships between developers, consultants andBenton Mortgage, the inspector general replied: ``I'm not at libertyto discuss an ongoing investigation, a subject of a grand juryinvestigation.''   Morrison dropped that line of questioning when Lantos warned itmight jeopardize the grand jury's probe.   The housing and employment subcommittee also is investigatingalleged abuse, influence-peddling and mismanagement in HUD programsto fix up rundown housing complexes for the poor.   Adams said his first report of problems in the coinsuranceprogram was sent to then-Assistant Secretary of Housing Phil Abrams,one of several former HUD employees who was paid as a consultant onprojects funded under a HUD program.</TEXT></DOC>
