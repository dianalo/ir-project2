The specific surface area was increasedby thinning, thereby improving the adsorption rate. Experiments on thecontacting properties of sheet-type fibrous adsorbents showed that masstransfer resistance between liquid and the fiber at sea flow rate couldbe ignored. A current-driven system which considerably reduces the operatingcosts can be used. The intrafiber diffusion coefficient for alkali-treatedsuperfine fiber amidoxime fiber (SFF-AOF) was determined to be 5.0 x10/sup -14/ m/sup 2//s. This is four times greater than that of untreatedSFF-AOF, owing to the increase in the number of hydrophilic groups.</TEXT></DOC>
