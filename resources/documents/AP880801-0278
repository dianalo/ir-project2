Separately, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said he planned tointroduce legislation to speedily extend a cooling-off period inthe labor dispute for 36 days, which would postpone any strikeaction.   The railroad offered to accept a recommendation by apresidential emergency panel to eliminate 700 brakemen's jobs,instead of the 1,150 cuts Candamp;NW had previously said were needed.   But United Transportation Union general counsel Robert Hart saidthe union was not impressed by the offer. ``That won't settle it,''Hart said.   Candamp;NW spokesman James Foote said the railroad ``made aconcessionary offer to the union to try and settle this dispute.''   But he acknowledged the railroad is ``not very hopeful'' theunion will accept the offer to avert the strike, scheduled to beginThursday.   The recommendation initially came from the PresidentialEmergency Board in July, which President Reagan appointed in Aprilin an effort to solve the longstanding dispute, Foote said.   Until Monday's compromise offer, Candamp;NW had said it wanted to save$51 million a year by cutting most of its train crews from four totwo people, eliminating what it considers unnecessary brakemen'sjobs and leaving an engineer and conductor on board.   The union has considered that move unacceptable.   The presidential panel recommended that all the railroad'sfreight trains be operated with three brakemen instead of four,that only two brakemen be used on certain nonstop freight trains,Foote said.   The strike would affect commuters in a six-county area aroundChicago for whom Candamp;NW provides service through an agreement withMetra, a suburban commuter rail service. It would also affectfreight service in several Midwestern states.   However, neither side can act until a cooling-off period orderedby Reagan ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4.   Hart said Monday's move by the Candamp;NW was intended to persuadeCongress not to extend the cooling-off period.   ``Candamp;NW doesn't want'' the strike to be postponed, he said.``They want it to come to a head.   ``All the purpose of this statement is to persuade Congress notto take any action,'' Hart said.   But in Washington, Simon spokesman David Carle said an extensionof the cooling-off period would give both sides ``breathing room''to come up with a solution on their own.   He said Simon would introduce the bill under a ``fast-track''procedure that would allow a Senate vote Tuesday, and would workwith several House members who could get it through that chamberthe next day.</TEXT></DOC>
