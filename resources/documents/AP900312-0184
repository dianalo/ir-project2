A coalition of opposition leaders, keeping to a timetable setwhen Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril relinquished power on Saturday, said itwould announce its choice for an interim president today.   At least 24 people had been killed in the seven days of protestsand clashes that have left this Caribbean nation leaderless and inturmoil. Most of the victims have been civilians slain by soldiersor police.   ``The people have shown how much they love democracy by dyingfor it,'' the Rev. Bertrand Aristide, a Roman Catholic who has beena staunch critic of the government, said in an interview on RadioAntilles.</TEXT><DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Patricio Aylwin called for anend to violence and hate as he took over from long-ruling Gen.Augusto Pinochet, but street disturbances marred the celebration ofdemocracy's rebirth.   ``Chile doesn't want more violence, it doesn't want more war,''Aylwin declared Sunday night from the balcony of the presidentialpalace after his inauguration earlier in the day.   Thousands below him cheered the end of Pinochet's 16-year rule.   ``This infant being born, this liberty we are reconquering, wehave to take care of it,'' said the 71-year-old Aylwin. He saidthat would require ``knowing how to respect one another, neveragain having Chileans divided into enemies.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New weapons to catch spies _ including rewardsfor reporting turncoat relatives and greater FBI access to taxrecords _ are being studied by a panel of private citizens workingbehind closed doors for the leaders of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee.   Many of the ideas under discussion revolve around money _ nowthe most common motivation for those who deliver U.S. secrets toforeign governments.   Without any public announcement, nine men usually at the beckand call of presidents were recruited last spring by Sens. DavidBoren, D-Okla., and William Cohen, R-Maine, chairman and vicechairman of the Intelligence Committee, for a unique effort torespond to ``the decade of the spy.''   Most of the nine are former White House, CIA, State or Justiceofficials who, Cohen said, not only are trusted by the nation'sintelligence officers but also can rally political support ifcontroversial new laws seem needed.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Get ready, America. Your ``no tax increase''federal government is about to start collecting another new tax.   As taxes go, this one isn't much. Most of the impact will be onbusinesses, at least at first. It could raise the price of atelephone by a dime but add $25 or so to the cost of recharging anautomobile air conditioner.   On April 1, the government will begin collecting this new tax,which is aimed at limiting use of chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbons,or CFCs _ that are deemed to damage the ozone layer protecting theEarth.   It has the dual task of raising about $4.3 billion for deficitreduction over the next five years.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Tompkins Square Park band shell is filledeach night with piles of ragged blankets. A passerby might hearsneezes and snores and realize there are people underneath, butcertainly wouldn't know how many, or their sex, race or age.   That is what census workers are being asked to find out _without waking anyone up _ from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. March 21 at parksand other outdoor sites where the homeless congregate.   The survey is part of an unprecedented nationwide count inshelters, parks, subways, vacant buildings, doorways andbank-machine vestibules. The plan's critics call it poorly designedand doomed to undercount the homeless, estimated by the Coalitionfor the Homeless to number 70,000 to 90,000 in New York City alone.   The Census Bureau already has issued a disclaimer.</TEXT></DOC>
