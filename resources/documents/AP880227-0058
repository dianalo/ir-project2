As the Friends of the Wolf members began their effort in theMuskwa Valley on Friday, the Western Canadian Wilderness Committeewas in British Columbia's Supreme Court in Vancouver seeking aninjunction to halt the wolf hunt.   Justice Alan Macdonell declined to order an immediate injunctionbut ordered that the application be heard Monday.   Meanwhile, another environmental group, Earth First, planned itsown protest and said it would have people hike into the area tointerfere with the government-paid hunters.   The provincial government's Enviornmental Ministry announcedMonday that about 55 wolves will be shot in a 3,700-square-milearea of the valley.   Biologists blame wolves for reducing populations of moose, stonesheep, elk and caribou to low levels in the area.   Since 1977, more than 1,000 wolves have been killed in BritishColumbia, and experts estimate there are 7,000 wolves in theprovince. Controls in other provinces vary _ Ontario permits thehunting of coyotes but not timber wolves, while Alberta hasconsidered a wolf kill for northern areas.   The three Friends of the Wolf protesters _ Myra Finkelstein,Renee Grandi, and Randy Reibin _ were equipped for 10 days in theregion, where temperatures can drop far below zero at night, theorganization said.   They were carrying video and camera equipment in the belief thatif the hunt was recorded, it would prevent hunters from carryingout the kill.   ``With witnesses there, we're pretty confident the hunters won'teven show up,'' said Sue Rodriguez-Pastor in a telephone interviewfrom Fort St. John, about 500 miles northeast of Vancouver.   If the government-paid hunters are not deterred, she said theprotesters will try to scare the wolves away with the noise of potsand pans.   Ralph Archibald, coordinator of the fish and wildlife branch'scarnivore control program, said Friday he doubted the protesterscould disrupt the hunt.   ``The Muskwa is a very large area,'' said Archibald in atelephone interview from Victoria. ``The probability of thesegroups bumping into each other is pretty low.''</TEXT></DOC>
