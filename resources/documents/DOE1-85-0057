From these gas compositons, the field was classifiedinto Zone A, B and C, and delta {sup 13}C was -23to-24% in Zone A, -18to -17% in Zone B and -16 to -11% in Zone C respectively. It was foundthat the distribution survey of H{sub 2} concentration and carbon isotopicratio were effective to find the deep geothermal field and the zone extension.(5 figs, 1 tab, 24 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
