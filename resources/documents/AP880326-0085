Some conservatives counter that Reagan's positions are very muchin tune with the American mainstream.   The enactment of the Civil Rights Restoration Act over Reagan'sveto was the latest skirmish in the administration's rockyseven-year attempt to redefine _ and some say erase _ the federalgovernment's role in ensuring basic rights to all citizens.   Reagan and his conservative allies contend they are committed toa ``colorblind'' society and reject the idea that they are lessconcerned about discrimination than those who support strongerremedies.   But their vision has led to years of confrontation withDemocrats and liberals and often with moderates, conservatives,Republicans and business people as well.   ``People simply don't want to go back and undo things that havebeen accomplished over the last 20 years,'' says veteran civilrights attorney William Taylor, who helped draft the restorationact.   But some conservatives say the administration's victories havenot drawn the attention they deserve and do, in fact, reflect thepublic's feelings.   ``The picture is more mixed than perhaps some would have peoplethink about the Reagan administration and its civil rights policyand how much it's in sync with the public,'' said former AssociateDeputy Attorney General Bruce Fein, now a fellow at theconservative Heritage Foundation.   Fein said the media has not fairly portrayed theadministration's progress toward its civil rights goals. ``On thevictories, they end up with a little three-graf snippet on page25,'' he complained.   But Ralph Neas, executive director of the 185-group LeadershipConference on Civil Rights, said the victories have been smalland-or temporary.   ``Congress and the Supreme Court have reined in the excesses ofthe Reagan administration,'' he said. ``The only time they (theadministration) have been able to do anything or change anything iswhen they have acted by executive fiat.''   The administration provoked an uproar early in 1982 when ittried to reverse a longstanding policy of not giving tax breaks tosegregated schools and caused more controversy a year later byfiring three liberal members of the supposedly independent CivilRights Commission.   Among other things, the administration has also tried and failedto:   _Block strong economic sanctions against the South Africangovernment for its apartheid policy.   _Dismantle or weaken ongoing school busing and affirmativeaction plans.   _End affirmative action goals and timetables for governmentcontractors.   _Block a tough new extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982and win a different interpretation of it three years later in theSupreme Court.   _Dissuade Congress from enacting a new holiday honoring MartinLuther King.   _Elevate the architect of its civil rights policies, AssistantAttorney General William Bradford Reynolds, to associate attorneygeneral.   Those are the major defeats. Where are the comparable victories?   Some point to the Supreme Court's 1984 decision narrowingprotection under four civil rights laws to specific federallyassisted programs, rather than prohibiting an entire institutionfrom discriminating if any part of it receives aid. But that rulingwas reversed last week with the veto override.   There were also two Supreme Court rulings in which the justicesfound newer minority employees were improperly shielded fromlayoffs while innocent white workers with more seniority were letgo.   But the Justice Department later was rebuffed when it asked 51local jurisdictions to scrap hiring and promotion plans on thebasis of the court rulings on seniority and layoffs. One Republicanmayor, William Hudnut of Indianapolis, said he refused to complywith the request because he felt it was wrong constitutionally,morally and politically.   The high court went on to deal a double blow to theadministration in 1986, approving the Cleveland Fire Department'splan to reserve half of all promotions for minority candidates andendorsing a labor union's use of racial quotas to help moreminorities get jobs.   Fein cited several lower court rulings that threw out racialquotas in government contracting and said the Supreme Court wouldreview them. He also noted a federal appeals court decision thismonth striking down racial quotas used to avert ``white flight'' atan integrated Brooklyn housing development, Starrett City. Thedecision stemmed from a 1984 suit filed by the Justice Department.   Taylor and others in the civil rights community do say thatReagan has succeeded in dismantling much of the federal civilrights law enforcement machinery and has kept advocates busy forseven years with rearguard actions.   On the other hand, they say, in their forced re-examination andre-evaluation of the nation's civil rights policies, Congress andthe courts have deemed them essentially sound.   ``The basic threat the administration posed was turning theclock back and turning the country in a different direction,''Taylor said. ``They sure tried hard. They failed every time. To me,that is a very encouraging development.''</TEXT></DOC>
