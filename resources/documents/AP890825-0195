(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 20-pound badger killed on a Wyominghighway is spending the hereafter stuffed in a fierce pose, mountedon wheels and racing hither and yon trying to scare some sense intooverly friendly ferrets.   He's called ``Robo-Badger'' by his handlers from the SmithsonianInstitution's National Zoo, who hope his radio-controlled scaretactics will help ferrets reared in captivity learn to protectthemselves from predators when they are returned to the wild.   If Robo-Badger's menacing lunges aren't enough to instill fear,zoo conservationists pelt the puzzled ferrets with rubber bands,whose harmless stings usually encourage them to dive into thenearest hole.   Another fear-inspiring weapon is a stuffed owl with outstretchedwings that swoops down on a hand-operated pulley and string to buzzthe sleek, furry ferrets as they scamper over a dirt mound.   Here in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains about 80 mileswest of Washington, at a former training camp for U.S. Army cavalrytroops, scientists are conducting ``predator-avoidance training''for ferrets at an outpost of the National Zoo that is dedicated tosaving endangered wildlife from extinction.   Wildlife biologist Brian Miller says his project at the zoo'sConservation and Research Center is aimed at ensuring the survivalof the North American black-footed ferret, which he calls ``one ofthe most endangered mammals in the world.''   Hundreds of thousands of these ferrets, the chief predators ofprairie dogs, once lived in the vast arid grasslands of the West,from southern Canada to northern Mexico. But they fell victim toagricultural development and the federal government's program toeradicate grass-eating prairie dogs as a threat to the livelihood ofcattle ranchers.   Deprived of their main source of food as well as shelter inprairie dog burrows, the ferrets rapidly fell prey to disease andother predators such as great horned owls, golden eagles andbadgers. By 1985, only 10 black-footed ferrets remained, all of themin Wyoming.   They were quickly removed to the safety of captivity, wherebreeding was begun. Today, says Miller, there are 120 black-footedferrets at the Wyoming game and fish research center at SybilleCanyon, Wyo., the Henry Doorly Zoo at Omaha, Neb., and at FrontRoyal.   ``They were raised in captivity and they know nothing aboutpredators,'' Miller said in an interview.   ``They have never seen a badger. Will they duck when they seeone? Will they run into a hole? It's one thing to be afraid, andanother thing to know what to do. We want them to get into that holeas quickly as possible.''   Enter Robo-Badger.   The badger was a road kill found lying alongside a Wyominghighway. At Miller's request, it was hustled into a freezer andshipped across the country to Washington, where Smithsoniantaxidermist Paul Rhymer transformed it into a battery-operated robot.   Stuffed with ears bent back and front paws clawing as if chasinga prey, the badger was mounted on the chassis of a toy truck withminiature tractor wheels and a tiny, red-tipped antenna forreceiving radioed stop-and-go and directional commands.   Miller is experimenting first with 50 Siberian polecats, morepopulous first cousins of black-footed ferrets from Soviet Asiawhich were bred from stock imported from the Moscow Zoo.   In the first couple months of testing, the Siberian ferrets seemmostly curious about Robo-Badger, but more frightened by theswooping owl.   Once he has determined what ferrets know instinctively from their``genetic memory'' about self-protection, feeding, digging intoburrows and other necessities in the wild, Miller will know whattraining in captivity is required to prepare the black-footedvariety for its return to the wild.   If the black-footed ferrets make a comeback there, he said, otherspecies of plant and animal life _ birds, insects, small mammals andshrubs _ may also flourish and help restore what was once a ``richoasis of diversity'' in the ecosystem of prairie dog communities.   Working in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Wyoming game and fish officials and experts at North Carolina StateUniversity, Miller hopes to give the ferrets their freedom inWyoming's Absoroka Mountains adjacent to Yellowstone Park sometimein 1991, if the current population of 57 adults has grown to 200 bythen.   ``They've had a pretty hard time,'' he said. ``They deserve thebest shot we can give them.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
