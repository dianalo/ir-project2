At the heart of the debate is a fundamental question: Canthe market for health care work like the market for autos ortomatoes? Or is health care an exception, like defense andhighways, that is unsuited to market mechanisms and must beprovided by the government?</LP><TEXT>   Nearly every other developed country has given up on themarket as a means of dispensing health care. But the Bushadministration hasn't. The plan it is now crafting behindclosed doors is an effort to use market forces to address thenation's two overwhelming health-care problems: runaway costsand limited access.   Most Democrats, in contrast, believe that only increasedgovernment involvement can cure these ills, although theydiffer over the degree of federal control that's necessary.The result is almost certain to be a showdown. While on otherissues the two parties often drift toward middlegroundcompromises, on health care, many on both sides agree thatthe middle of the road is the most dangerous place to be.   &quot;These are fundamentally different alternatives. Theydon't lend themselves to a mix-and-match approach,&quot; WhiteHouse Budget Director Richard Darman, a leading architect ofthe administration's plan, recently told Congress. &quot;If wewish to have a coherent approach to reform, the politicalsystem will have to choose one of the conceptualalternatives.&quot;   Ever since Pennsylvania's Harris Wofford, campaigning fornational health insurance, upset former Attorney General DickThornburgh in a U.S. Senate race, President Bush has beenunder heavy pressure to come up with a plan to addressAmerica's health-care problems. While he hasn't made finaldecisions about what he'll propose, and many of the proposalswill be seen as tiny steps, the principles that will guidethe president's plan are now clear:   The administration's plan would give low-income people themeans, probably through tax credits, to buy their own privateinsurance rather than having the government provide itdirectly;   It will offer incentives to prod people into enrolling inhealth-maintenance organizations or other prepaid healthsystems, which are generally less costly;   And it will include measures intended to reform theprivate health-insurance market and ensure that people withhigh health risks can still get insurance.   The package stands in stark contrast to the positionsbeing staked out by leading Democrats in Congress and in thepresidential campaign. A number are proposing aCanadian-style system that would have the government providetaxpayer-financed health coverage to everyone and wouldregulate the fees of hospitals and doctors. Others areadvocating a less-radical &quot;play or pay&quot; system that requiresbusinesses to either provide insurance to all employees orcontribute to a government-financed health plan. Evenadvocates of play or pay, however, favor expanded governmentpower to control health-care costs.   The federal government is already the largest player inhealth care. Through Medicare, a program for the elderly, andMedicaid, for the poor, as well as through programs forsoldiers and veterans, the federal government accounts for42% of the roughly $700 billion spent on health care eachyear. The Bush administration has no immediate plans toreplace those programs, although its budget due out laterthis month will propose large savings in Medicare andMedicaid.   Nearly everyone seems to agree the current system doesn'twork very well, and cries for fixing it are becoming everlouder. An estimated 37 million Americans are without healthinsurance, a number swelled by the loss of more than amillion jobs during the recession. Some people keep jobsthey'd like to leave just to retain the health coverage.Other employees complain that their employers are pushing anincreasing portion of health costs on them. At the same time,employers also feel heavily burdened by the rising cost ofhealth care for employees, a concern that sometimesinfluences their hiring plans.   &quot;I can think of no other issue more important to themiddle class and to small business than health care,&quot; KarlHall, the owner of a small transportation brokerage firm,recently told Democratic senators.   The rising political pressure virtually guarantees thathealth care will remain a top issue in Washington for thenext decade. And the stark contrast between administrationand Democratic approaches ensures that as long as bothparties have power, it won't be easy to solve. Here is a lookat the plan taking shape within the Bush administration, aswell as the rival Democratic schemes:                                                                                                          Bush: Market Forces                                                                                                          Democrats will immediately attack the White House healthplan as piecemeal reform and futile life-support of a systemthat is terminally ill. But some of the president's adviserssee it as a first step down a path of radical transformationof the health-care system that they plan to follow moreboldly after the election.   The Bush administration is learning what serious studentsof U.S. health care have known for years: It is a huge andenormously complex system in which attempts to make modestimprovements often backfire and make things worse. Thispattern leads analysts to advocate major overhaul. Butoverhauling an industry that now accounts for 12% of theeconomy frightens consensus-seeking politicians.   Some of Mr. Bush's political advisers have been urging hisnew chief of staff, Samuel Skinner, not to rush into themorass. Mr. Skinner has been soliciting views of the AmericanMedical Association and of corporate heavyweights, and evenallowing visitors to cross-examine White House healthplanners.   Yesterday Mr. Bush met with about a dozen representativesof a group advocating a free-market approach to health-careoverhaul. According to people who were there, the presidentsaid Americans are ready for &quot;sound and sensible&quot; health-carereform, but stressed that he didn't want to do anything thatwould hurt the economy or cost jobs. The group urged him notto propose politically explosive measures, such as putting acap on the income-tax exemption for benefits.   The philosophy behind the plan is espoused by manyconservative economists who believe they can use the tax codeto fix the system by making people more sensitive to the costof their health care, and by forcing insurers, doctors,hospitals, nursing homes and all others to compete on priceand quality for patients' business. But critics say thereisn't enough information made available for people to shopintelligently.   One means of sensitizing people to cost would be to limitthe amount of employer-provided health benefits exempt fromincome tax. All are currently exempt, undermining theincentive for employees or companies to question the cost ofcare. The administration is studying a proposal that wouldrequire people earning more than $100,000 a year to payincome tax on any health benefits they get from theiremployer that exceed $4,000 a year. This would affectrelatively few people, but administration officials look atthis as a foot in the door. They argue that the proposalwould establish an important principle, and that the limitscould be lowered in the future.   In order to deal with some of the 37 million people whohave no insurance, the administration would provide taxcredits or vouchers for the purchase of insurance. The planis likely to limit these to people with incomes of no morethan 150% of the poverty line. That would mean covering onlya fraction of those now uninsured, but again, the move wouldestablish a position that could be expanded later.   By using tax credits or vouchers, rather than providinggovernment insurance outright, the administration hopes toforce people to shop for the best quality coverage at thelowest price. Under the freemarket approach, tax credits orvouchers might even eventually replace Medicaid and Medicare,further reducing the government's role.   The White House plan also will aim to give the insuranceindustry a push toward the market, including measures thatwould make it easier for small businesses and individuals toband together into large risk pools that would lower theirpremiums. In addition, it would provide a variety of measuresto compel insurance companies to continue to provide healthcoverage to people with serious medical conditions. And therewould be new incentives to encourage people, starting withthose on Medicaid and Medicare, to enroll in organizationsproviding prepaid health care. In theory, such groups have agreater incentive to control costs.   The administration is also considering a proposal to makeit easier for middle-class taxpayers to deduct some healthexpenses.   Mr. Bush has not made any final decisions about what hewill propose, administration officials say. Though he earliersaid he would have a health-care plan ready for his State ofthe Union Message Jan. 28, officials now say he will begin tolay out the plan in the speech, and unveil a detailedproposal a few weeks later.                                                                                                          Democrats: More Government                                                                                                          Democrats have introduced dozens of health-care-reformbills over the past year, all based on the premise thatprivate markets can't be expected to address such afundamental human need as health. &quot;No one can distributeGucci loafers better than the market,&quot; says Uwe Reinhardt, aPrinceton economist who specializes in health care. &quot;But apure market cannot distribute health care.&quot;   Though many Democrats contend that enactingtaxpayer-financed universal health insurance is politicallyimpossible in the U.S., some influential Democrats back thatapproach. They include Rep. Pete Stark, chairman of a Househealth subcommittee, and a Democratic presidential candidate,Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.   Under a Canadian-style national health system, Americanswould receive government-paid hospital, doctor and dentalcare, as well as prescription drugs, mental health servicesand long-term care. This would not be full-blown socializedmedicine; everyone could choose his own private-sectordoctor, hospital or nursing home. But the government would bedeeply involved in setting the budgets of hospitals andnursing homes and establishing fees for doctors and otherhealth-care providers.   While patients would spend virtually nothing on care,they'd pay for that benefit with higher taxes. Rep. MartyRusso (D., Ill.), the chief sponsor of a leading nationalhealth insurance bill, contends that the country wouldactually end up saving $40 billion on health expendituresoverall. Businesses wouldn't have to buy health insurance fortheir employees. Consumers wouldn't have to pay premiums ordeductibles. Hospitals wouldn't raise bills to make up forbad debts. And most people believe the system could save tensof billions of dollars on paper work if the government werethe only health-care customer.   But others argue that a nationalized system would bevastly more expensive, by encouraging people to seekunnecessary care. &quot;National health insurance would give usall the compassion of the IRS and the efficiency of thepostal service -- at Pentagon prices,&quot; declares ConstanceHorner, until recently the No. 2 official at the Health andHuman Services Department.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell is among Democratspushing for lessradical change, a &quot;pay or play&quot; plan. Thegovernment would draw up a package of core benefits andrequire every employer to offer them to employees or else paya percent of payroll (as yet undetermined) to finance apublic plan for all working or unemployed people lackinginsurance.   To hold down costs, the Mitchell proposal would establisha &quot;federal health expenditure board,&quot; with stature andindependence similar to the Federal Reserve Board, whichwould set national health spending goals. While the boardwouldn't be able to set prices, it would try to negotiaterecommended rates of payment with health-care providers.Similar pay-or-play legislation, submitted by House Ways andMeans Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), wouldlimit the annual growth in both public and private healthspending to the growth in the gross national product, andauthorize the government to set nationwide fees for doctors,hospitals and other providers at whatever level is needed toadhere to that restriction.   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the HouseLabor and Human Resources Committee, says the panel will takeup the Mitchell bill when Congress reconvenes next week.   Many experts argue that comprehensive health-care overhaulwill only be achieved incrementally. The U.S. politicalprocess, they say, is too cumbersome for radical change. Buteven those who favor a cautious approach say it is criticalthat the nation decide on which general direction it isheading: toward more competition or toward more regulation.Which course the nation takes could well be decided by thisyear's presidential and congressional elections.   ---   Staff reporter David Wessel contributed to this article.   ---            Competing Health-Care Philosophies                                                                                                                            BUSH                 DEMOCRAT                    ------      ----------------------------                    MARKET      GOVERNMENT RUN   PAY OR PLAY                                                                                                        Access for all     Yes          Yes            Yes                    eventually                                                                                                                                                                                                               Cost control       Left to      Gov.'t-set     Some gov.'t                    marketplace  budgets        intervention                                                                                                                                                                                                               Quality assurance  Left to      Undetermined   Undetermined                    marketplace                                                                                                                                                                                                               New mandated       No           Yes            Yes employer spending or tax                                                                                                                                                                                                               Major role for     Yes          Generally no   Yes private insurers                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tax exemption for  Capped or    Not            Unlimited employer-paid      eventually   applicable premiums           eliminated                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tax credits to     Yes          No             No cover health insurance                                                                                                                                                                                                               Medicare and       Could be     Replaced with  Replaced Medicaid           eliminated   national       with public                    over time    health         plan for                                 insurance      those not                                                covered by                                                employers</TEXT></DOC>
