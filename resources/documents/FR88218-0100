No. 36-00925) locatedin Indiana County, Pennsylvania. The petition is filed under section 101(c)of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that automatic fire sensor andwarning device systems provide identification of any fire within each beltflight.2. Petitioner states that the belt fire detection system presently in useat the mine will result in a diminution of safety because the system doesnot issue a warning until a fire actually exists and the flames cause thetemperature to rise to a sufficient level, thereby exposing miners to therisks associated with belt fires.3. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to install an early warningfire detection system, in addition to heat point sensor devices. A low-levelcarbon monoxide (CO) detection system would be installed in all belt entriesused as intake or return aircourses and at each belt drive and tailpiecelocated in intake aircourses. The low-level carbon monoxide system wouldbe capable of giving warning of a fire for four hours after the sourceof power to the belt is removed, and a device would be installed whichwould be capable of activating an alarm in case of low-charged batteries.A visual alert signal would be activated when the CO level is 10 partsper million (ppm) above ambient air and an audible signal would sound at15 ppm above ambient air. All persons would be withdrawn to a fresh airarea outby the working places with communication to the surface at 10 ppmand evacuated at 15 ppm. The fire alarm signal would be activated at anattended surface where there is two-way communication. The CO system wouldbe capable of identifying any activated sensor and monitoring electricalcontinuity to detect any malfunctions. In addition, the system would beequipped with an audible alarm to be activated in the event any such malfunctionsoccur in the system and would also be equipped with a surge suppressorconnected to outstations and datalines capable of taking a high voltagesurge of electricity to ground.4. The CO system would be visually examined at least once each coal-producingshift and tested for functional operation weekly to ensure the monitoringsystem is functioning properly. The monitoring system would be calibratedwith known concentrations of CO and air mixtures at least monthly.5. If the CO monitoring system is deenergized or malfunctions, the conveyorbelt would be completely stopped and all personnel inby the last workingsensor would be withdrawn to a point outby the next working sensor.6. Positioning and installation of sensors would be done so that both verticaland horizontal placement ensures maximum detection. CO sensors would bepositioned in a combination track and belt haulageway so that the sensorswould not be affected by any external heat sources.7. When a CO monitoring system has the capability of expanding its functions,i.e., monitoring belts, bearing temperature, water, these expansions wouldbe done without affecting the normal function of the system.8. The CO monitoring system would be designed so that the system cannotbe inadvertently shut down by accidentally punching one key. It will beprogrammed so that a coded message would have to be fed into the system.9. If a sensor detects 15 ppm above the established ambient level for themine, all section alarms on that split of air would be activated. The personsent to make the determination of the cause of activation will carry aself-contained self-rescuer, a hand-held methane detector and a CO detectiondevice with a built-in alarm that will activate at 50 ppm of carbon monoxide.10. The CO detection device would be available for use on each workingsection. These devices would be used for one shift and then transportedto the surface where a qualified person will recharge and calibrate them.11. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
