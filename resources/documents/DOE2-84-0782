Factor VIII is requiredfor the proteolytic cleavage of Factor X by activated Factor IX. Themechanistic role of Factor VIII in this reaction has not been elucidated.Factor VIII has not been satisfactorily purified and characterized dueto its trace concentration in plasma (100 to 200 ng/ml) and because itis easily proteolyzed. Ted Tuddenham of the Royal Free Hospital in Londonin collaboration with Genentech has provided a number of preparationsderived from human plasma which are substantially enriched for FactorVIII and in which the Factor VIII had been separated from its carrierprotein von Willebrand Factor. Typically, in these preparations whichbegin with 100 liters of plasma, Factor VIII is purified 300,000 foldwith a 3 to 10 per cent yield to give 300 to 500 {mu}g of protein whichstill shows a number of bands when analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis.The most prominent bands found on these gels under reducing conditionsare at 210 kilodaltons (kd) and 80 kd. A series of 6 to 8 other bandsfrom 200 kd to 90 kd are also found as well as some fainter lower molecularweight species.</TEXT></DOC>
