(shown at the Seybold Seminars' Digital World conference inJune but not at Macworld Expo) fall into this class, as does the editorsegment of the forthcoming Video F/X machine from Digital F/X Inc.andM;Step 5.andP;  In the fifth stage, we're finally editing actual captured videoimages on-screen rather than working only with boxes.andP;  Using reduced imagescaptured from our video sources as stand-ins for segments, we can do trueWYSIWYG video layout.andM;More to come.andP;  There's more to good editing than rearranging video segments,but the programs currently on the market are trying to make video as familiara data type as text.andP;  Perhaps when we reach Step 6, the software will havethe capability to make a complete picture.andM;Send tips and comments to Steve Rosenthal, c/o MacWEEK, 301 Howard St., 15thFloor, San Francisco, Calif.andP;  94105; AppleLink: Steve.R; MCI: 114-8611.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
