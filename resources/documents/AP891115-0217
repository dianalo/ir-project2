By coincidence, the first major retrospective exhibitions ofGerard Sekoto's paintings and Jackson Hlungwani's sculptures aresimultaneously on display this month in Johannesburg. Critics havegreeted both with superlative praise.   One reviewer described the Hlungwani show as ``the mostimportant sculpture exhibition yet held in South Africa.'' Sekoto,wrote another critic, ``is one of the greatest figures of20th-century South African art.''   Sekoto, 75, lives in a home for retired artists outside Parisand has not returned to South Africa since going into self-imposedexile in 1947. His finest works, critics agree, are gentle scenesof black urban life painted in South Africa in the eight yearsbefore he emigrated.   Many of his paintings depict black and mixed-race inner-cityneighborhoods in Cape Town and Johannesburg that later were razedby the government and reconstructed as whites-only districts.   The exhibition of 138 of his works, many of them loaned fromprivate collections, has drawn large crowds to the Johannesburg ArtGallery, the largest exhibition facility in the country's largestcity.   ``It has taken about as long for Sekoto to attain publicrecognition in his own native country as it has for theJohannesburg Art Gallery to wake up to the fact that whites cannever carry the full weight of this country's political, economicand cultural self-fulfillment,'' said Eskia Mphahlele, a friend ofthe painter and former professor of African literature at theUniversity of the Witwatersrand, at the opening of the exhibition.   The New Nation, an anti-apartheid newspaper, said in its reviewthat for decades Sekoto was deprived of proper recognition``because of the one-sided focus which was placed on the work ofwhite artists by galleries, critics, art historians and authoritiesblindfolded by apartheid.''   Hlungwani, 66, is the son of a mineworker, never had formaleducation, has 12 children, and lost a finger in an industrialaccident when he worked as a laborer. He says he decided to take upsculpting after experiencing a religious vision.   ``I do the work of God by carving,'' he said in an interviewearlier this year. ``Art comes from all my body.''   Most of his works are carved from wood found in the area aroundtwo improvised temples he has built in a village in Gazankulu, ablack homeland near South Africa's northeastern border withMozambique. His creations include angels, crucifixes and many fish_ which he considers an important Christian symbol.   More than 200 of his works are on display at a convertedindustrial warehouse in one of Johannesburg's oldest districts.   ``His sculptures have transformed an ordinary old factory ...into a magical place of reverence,'' wrote Kendell Geers, a criticfor The Star, the country's largest-selling daily. ``The showcertainly sets a standard for South African art for the future.''   The New Nation has devoted full-page spreads to each of theshows.   ``It's an exciting and joyful time for art lovers inJohannesburg,'' the newspaper said. ``Two current exhibitions, bothunforgettable, are giving them the first comprehensive look at twoof South Africa's greatest artists.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Mon Nov. 20</NOTE></DOC>
