As President Bush signed sweeping legislation that will enact an industry bailout and restructuring, regulators began wrestling with that issue and numerous others affecting deposit rates, how quickly sick Sandamp;Ls will be sold, and under what terms.    The process includes gearing up a new federal agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., which will dispose of insolvent thrifts and their assets under direction of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Serving up the first slice of the $50 billion committed by the bill to sick thrifts, regulators said they will spend roughly $215 million this week to close, sell or merge three insolvent thrifts. The three institutions are to be named today.    &quot;With this bill's substantial funding, we will begin, here and now, to eliminate the ongoing losses of the insolvent firms,&quot; said Mr. Bush. &quot;I'm proud to sign this monster.&quot;    Already, federal officials have seized 262 insolvent Sandamp;Ls, in preparation for the bill's enactment. By the end of 1991, officials expect to take control of as many as 425 additional sick Sandamp;Ls.    But depositors and industry executives will begin seeing the effects of the bill much sooner. FDIC Chairman William Seidman said the RTC, which will have control of the sick Sandamp;Ls, hasn't yet decided whether to honor the above-market CD rates that the sick thrifts paid customers in order to attract funds. Certificates of deposit, for example, could be cashed out earlier, reducing some of the interest due to the customer, while paying all of the principal.    While it has always been the policy of the FDIC to honor the CD rates and terms, Mr. Seidman said the future course &quot;is still in discussion.&quot;    Before the government seized control, dozens of insolvent thrifts remained afloat solely because their unusually high rates brought in a flood of deposits, often in the form of $100,000 jumbo CDs. The rates -- often one or two percentage points higher than solvent, healthy thrifts were offering -- were a bonanza for investors, who couldn't lose because federal deposit insurance backed them up if the institution ultimately went under.    A decision to pay off the CDs early would probably draw at least some support on Capitol Hill, but would infuriate the financial firms that collected deposits from investors and packaged them into $100,000 blocks. Many congressmen have criticized so-called deposit brokers for funneling billions of dollars to insolvent thrifts when it was clear the government would eventually pick up the tab.    Whether that policy changes, administration officials believe that consumers will soon see a decline in rates paid to depositors. As a result of a compromise with Congress over how the funds would be raised, $20 billion must be spent before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. About $15 billion of that will be pumped into sick thrifts, which have been driving up the deposit rates. A decline in interest rates paid to depositors, a senior administration official said, is likely to be felt by Oct. 1.    Signing the bill, which authorizes spending at least $166 billion over 10 years, launched the dismantling of one federal agency and the birth of another. On an easel next to Mr. Bush was a new seal to be placed in the windows of all Sandamp;Ls: &quot;Deposits Fully Insured up to $100,000. Backed with the Full Faith and Credit of the United States Government.&quot;    Meanwhile, at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the signs for the thrift insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., were being removed and replaced with new logos for the Resolution Trust Corp.    The RTC's Oversight Board, which includes Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and other Treasury officials, met to determine what future deals by the FDIC to dispose of sick thrifts would look like. Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson was named interim president of the board.    Unlike transactions last year by thrift regulators at the Bank Board, the FDIC said it's likely to use cash to compensate buyers of sick thrifts for the bad assets they take on, rather than using notes or complex formulas that guarantee some form of return.    That policy will prevail even if the $50 billion to close ailing thrifts proves insufficient, and the government won't engage in &quot;uneconomic deals,&quot; said presidential assistant Richard Breeden. &quot;What we won't do is follow the path of trying to stretch the dollars as FSLIC was forced to do . . . because they didn't have short-term cash to handle the problem,&quot; Mr. Breeden said.    &quot;We're going to go after these deals and do it right, and do {the deals} at the lowest possible cost,&quot; he said. &quot;If we end up running out of money, fine, then we'll run out of money and end up asking for more.&quot;    ---@ Under RTC Control @ The 262 savings and loans institutions under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp. hold $89.3 billion in deposits.
