DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Many long distance telephone rates to pointsin the United States and abroad will be going down after the firstof the year, the three major long distance companies say.   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. filed reductions with theFederal Communications Commission Tuesday. MCI Communications Corp.and U.S. Sprint said they will take action to remain competitive.   ATandamp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long distance market,as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2with more than 10 percent. U.S. Sprint claims 7 to 8 percent.   The ATandamp;T reductions will take effect Jan. 1, barring an unusualaction by the FCC to block them.   The company said the reductions were taken in line with an FCCprice cap which has been reduced because local telephone companiesare charging long distance companies less for access to customers'lines.   ATandamp;T's submission to the FCC called for $300 million a year inreductions on interstate and international long distance servicesused primarily by residential and small business customers. Othercategories of service used by businesses, such as private lines and800 and 900 numbers, are not affected.   MCI spokesman John Hauser said the No. 2 long distance companyalso will reduce its rates to pass on the savings in localtelephone company charges. ``We will remain competitive withthem,'' he said. ``I don't know how much our total cost savingswill be.''   Hauser's counterpart at U.S. Sprint, Robin Pence, said, ``We arereviewing the filing and we intend to remain competitive.''   The company said price reductions will apply to its ``Reach OutAmerica'' and optional long distance plans as well as to basic longdistance service.   A 10-minute call during daytime hours on a weekday, to anywherein the United States, will cost $2.50 or less, a decrease of 1.3percent on the average, the company said. Some of the increaseswould be greater. For example, a 10-minute daytime call fromWashington to New York, which now costs $2.30, would decline to$2.20. Daytime hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time Monday throughFriday.   In the evening, the rate for a call to anywhere in the UnitedStates will drop by an average of 2 percent, the company said. Anevening call from Washington to San Francisco, Los Angeles orDallas, which now costs $1.67 for 10 minutes, would be $1.58. Theevening period is 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Friday.   Weekend rates are in effect all day Saturday and until 5 p.m. onSunday and the same rates apply from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. Sundaythrough Friday. These rates will not change. The maximum for such acall is $1.32 for 10 minutes within the United States, the companysaid.   Discounts for subscribers to the Reach Out America 24-hour planwill be increased from 5 percent to 10 percent on weekday calls andfrom 20 to 25 percent on evening calls. Under Reach Out America,the evening period is 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Friday.   International calls from the U.S. mainland to 25 of the mostfrequently called countries and overseas areas will be slashed by$104 million. The reductions will vary from country to country andthe countries will include Canada, Mexico, Japan, the UnitedKingdom, France, Italy, Israel, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines,Taiwan and Korea.   A five-minute call from anywhere in the United States to Japanbetween 2 and 8 p.m., now $8.72 at the standard rate prevailing inthose hours, will drop to $8.07. A similar call to Britain between1 and 6 p.m., when discount rates are in effect for such calls,will decline from $4.21 to $3.99. Calls to Mexico will decline from2 to 20 percent, depending on the time and the city from which thecall is placed. A five-minute call from New York to Cancun, now$7.90 at the standard rate, will drop to $5.90. Five minutes fromLos Angeles to Mexico City, now $6.15, will cost $5.55.   ATandamp;T said the reduction will be the company's 10th since 1984and would bring total rate decreases to 40 percent in the six yearssince the breakup of the Bell System.</TEXT></DOC>
