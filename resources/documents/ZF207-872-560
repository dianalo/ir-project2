 Just as Micropro International became WordStar,Inc. and a Lifetree Software spinoff was named Volkswriter, Inc., so hasLennane Advanced Products become DeScribe, Inc.andP;  In this case, though, it isinteresting that the name was changed before the product earned a reputation.andM;DeScribe is a WYSIWYG &quot;word publisher&quot; running under OS/2 PresentationManager.andP;  It blurs even further the already hazy boundaries between wordprocessing and desktop publishing.andM;We hope to publish a review of DeScribe within the next few months, so wewon't enumerate all of its powers here.andP;  The following is a summary of itsmost notable features.andM;DeScribe offers interactive WYSIWYG text entry and editing within theconstraints of PM (for which there are still precious few screen fonts).andO;There is only an actual-size view; other zoom levels will be available in thenext release, due in the first quarter of 1990.andM;Text: mostly good, but some weak points.andP;  DeScribe is far ahead of typicalword processors in text composition.andP;  For hyphenation, the user can specifythe minimum length of a hyphenatable word, the minimum number of charactersbefore or after a hyphen, and the maximum number of consecutive hyphens.andP;  Theprogram supports three levels of preferred hyphenation points (although itdoesn't use them in the most optimal way).andM;When PM fonts arrive in quantity, DeScribe will support kerning tables; fornow, the user can kern manually in 1/100s of an em.andP;  There is no truetracking, but character spacing adjustments can be applied globally.andP;  Theuser can set relative word spacing (the justification algorithm wasn'texplained to us), kerning and letter spacing, as well as the ratio of word toletter spacing.andM;A collection of text attributes can be saved as a style and applied to anyrange of text.andP;  An undo feature retracts an unlimited number of text (but notgraphic) changes one by one.andM;The program is weak in creating certain types of text, such as superscripts,subscripts and fractions.andP;  To achieve these specifications, the user mustchange the point size and leading values of the necessary characters--atedious process with great potential for error.andP;  There is also no simple wayto create dropped capitals.andM;Working with objects.andP;  A graphic or text object can be created visually or byspecifying measurements.andP;  Objects can be made to appear on all left or allright pages or both.andP;  Within a text object, a frame can be inserted insidetext that is inside a frame, and so forth (this is possible for at least sixlevels).andP;  The user can specify the offset for text runarounds, which can onlybe rectangular (as can object frames).andM;Objects can be imported; we saw a graph brought in from the Microsoft Excelspreadsheet program, which was running concurrently.andP;  The next release willcontain text and graphic conversion capabilities for both import and export.andM;A graphic object can be scaled along the horizontal or vertical axisindependently.andP;  It can also be forced to fit the object frame.andM;Speeding jobs by using macros.andP;  DeScribe contains powerful macro capabilitiesthat enable the user to speed up common tasks.andP;  The user can create macroseither by recording keystrokes or by using the sophisticated macro language.andO;In either case, macros are fully editable.andP;  They can be mapped touser-specified key combinations.andM;A collection of useful macros is included with the program.andP;  It should beeasy for even many nonprogrammers to configure these macros for theirpurposes or to write their own.andM;What's coming?andP;  Having jumped out to a headstart in the PM wordprocessing/layout race, DeScribe is pushing to keep up the pace.andP;  It plans toinclude in its next release such enhancements as password protection for anyobject or piece of text; widow and orphan control; the ability to makeobjects transparent; separate clipboards, for macros to use, that don'tinterfere with the operation of other programs; automatic creation of indexesand tables of contents; objects that float with text; footnotes; and supportfor the Dynamic Data Exchange protocol.andM;Later, DeScribe intends to use this program as the editing kernel for moresophisticated applications, such as an advanced page layout program.andP;  We'llkeep an alert eye on its further developments.andM;Xyquest brings a WYSIWYG surpriseandM;Sly marketers that they are, Xyquest's staff had kept a lid on its plans tounveil a preproduction version of XyWrite IV.andP;  All we received was alast-minute notice that we should absolutely not miss that booth.andP;  As XyWriteusers ourselves, we were curious enough to make Xyquest our first stop.andO;Here's what we saw.andM;XyWrite IV will be Xyquest's move (at last!) toward the wonderful world ofWYSIWYG.andP;  Using Agfa Compugraphic fonts, XyWrite IV offers an editableWYSIWYG display mode, in addition to the existing modes.andM;The program was shown with Times and Helvetica in seven sizes from 8 to 36points.andP;  In the WYSIWYG mode, it can also display graphics--initially, inPCL, TIFF and PCX formats.andP;  Users can specify an image's size, location,scale and crop area.andM;The version we saw had a typical assortment of preproduction bugs and quirksand not-fully-thought-out features.andP;  One such feature is that in amulticolumn display (see photo), there should be a direct way to movehorizontally between columns; we had to scroll to the end of one column tobring the cursor to the top of the next one.andM;Despite the software's rawness, though, it looked promising.andP;  In WYSIWYGmode, the speed loss was less than we might have feared.andP;  We congratulateXyquest on helping the convergence of word processing and interactive layoutsoftware.andM;The program is slated for a first-quarter 1990 release.andP;  Like its immediatepredecessor, it will list for $495.andP;  It will probably require 512K of RAM;III+ (with spelling checker) needs 384K.andM;Note to experienced XyWrite users: Xyquest is remapping some of the functionkeys in the new version.andP;  You can, however, change them back to the familiarset.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
