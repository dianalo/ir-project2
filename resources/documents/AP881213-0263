The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which on Nov. 29 reported onthe industry's loss for the third quarter, said the number ofinsolvent institutions fell from 498 as of June 30 to 434 as ofSept. 30. At the end of last year, there were 520 insolvents.   However, even as the government resolved or stabilized the casesof 86 Sandamp;Ls during the third quarter, 22 more slipped into insolvency.   The Sandamp;L industry is piling up the biggest loss this year sincethe Depression. Losses in the third quarter were $1.6 billion, downfrom $3.9 billion in both the first and second quarters.   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, declined to saywhether he thought thrift institution performance would improve orworsen in the fourth quarter, but he warned that rising interestrates will cut into earnings.   The relative health of commercial banking stands in starkcontrast to the condition of savings and loan institutions.   The nation's commercial banks are posting record profits thisyear and should have another good year in 1989, unless the ThirdWorld debt problem worsens dramatically, analysts say.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits up to$100,000 in 13,239 commercial banks, said Monday that the industryearned $5.9 billion in the July-September period, topping theprevious quarterly record of $5.8 billion set a year ago.   Earnings totaled $5.0 billion in the first quarter of this yearand $5.5 billion in the second.   ``I think we can say without much question that this year will bean all-time high for banking profits,'' FDIC Chairman L. WilliamSeidman told reporters.   The agency is predicting profits will top $23 billion in 1988,surpassing the record $18.1 billion earned in 1985. Last year, thelargest banks took big writedowns on loans to Third World countries,holding the industry's earnings to $3.6 billion, the weakest sincethe Depression.   Banks did not take further writedowns this year, but ``the LDC(less developed country) debt does remain a key overhanging issue,''said James H. Wooden, an analyst with the investment firm ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc.   The FDIC said the fact that Brazil has resumed payments on itshuge foreign debt, following a moratorium, should add $1.5 billionto the fourth-quarter bank earnings total.   But, Wooden warned, ``there's some expectation that Argentina isgoing to go non-performing. ... And if the government loses theelection in Brazil next November, we could be back to square onethere.''   Despite the good news for banks, Seidman sounded notes of cautionregarding an increase in bad loans and banks' rising involvement inleveraged buyouts.   Bad loans, on which borrowers have stopped making payments,jumped 4.3 percent from the second quarter to $76.5 billion in thethird, the FDIC said. Much of the increase came in the Southwest,where the economy has been depressed by troubles in the oil industry.   However, bad real estate loans in the New England states, NewJersey and Florida also rose.   ``We need to keep a careful eye on that,'' Seidman said. ``...But they are not, I repeat not, at alarming levels and not like theSouthwest.''   Robert G. Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co., said,``There's no question that real estate prices bolted up pretty highin some areas and there are some vulnerabilities there. Fortunatelyit doesn't seem to be national in scale.''   Seidman also said that a substantial, but undetermined, share ofbank income is coming from the boom in corporate buyouts.   ``Leveraged buyout transactions are becoming a big part ofbanking activity and that does increase the risk to some extent,''he said, but added: ``At this point ... I don't have any evidencethat would indicate that institutions are going to fail because ofleveraged buyouts.''   The strong 1988 earnings, paradoxically, are coming amid theworst year for bank failures since the Depression. Through lastweek, 213 banks either failed or were saved from failing throughgovernment assistance. That already tops the record of 203 for allof last year.   The failures reflect continuing troubles in the Southwest, and toa lesser extent the fallout from farm problems earlier in the decadein the Midwest. Of the failures this year, 114 were in Texas, 24 inOklahoma, 11 in Louisiana, nine in Colorado, eight each in Minnesotaand Kansas and seven in Iowa.</TEXT></DOC>
