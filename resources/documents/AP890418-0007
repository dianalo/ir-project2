But from the air, the miles of protective barrier desperateAlaskans have spread out to keep the nation's worst oil spill fromtheir corner of paradise look pitifully inadequate.   In the quiet coves and inlets of Kachemak Bay, the view isencouraging. The taut line of boom, some of it homemade, gives theappearance of a beaver dam during spring's high water.   The fortifications at Tutka Lagoon look worthy of itsimportance. Pale blue, commercially manufactured boom swirl in asemi-circle from the narrow mouth of the lagoon.   Lest any oil creep by, a second line extends hard across themouth between steep rocky shorelines, punctuated by thick Sitkaspruce.   Several hundred yards up the narrow channel sits an emeraldpool, the crown jewel of the lower Cook Inlet pink salmon fishery.   Floating wooden pens, housing more than 40 million salmonsmaller than a finger, nestle inside a blue diamond of boom. Thishatchery accounts for about 90 percent of the pink salmon caughtcommercially each year in the lower inlet.   The Gulf of Alaska is just a short trip away. This side of theKenai Peninsula has been hard hit by the oil the residents of CookInlet and Kachemak Bay hope to escape.   Just above the mouth of Port Dick Creek, mountain goats seek outpatches of vegetation exposed by retreating snow. A bright orangeboom slumps on the mudflats below.   Several hundred yards out, a glob of weathered oil ``mousse''clashes with the crystalline water.   Farther toward the gulf are more and more patches of mousse,ribbons of rainbow-hued sheen streaming behind them in the wind.   In the open water, the mousse has stretched into long strands bydays of vigorous wind. On one side of the spectacular rockyoutcropping, known as Gore Point, squats a large pool of the sicklybrown oil.   Nearby, seagulls hover almost motionless against the wind,oblivious to the slow, agonizing death awaiting them should theyswoop into the water.   ``I wonder what's going to happen to an animal when it getstangled up in that?'' asked pilot Bill De Creeft, who has flownfloatplanes throughout the region for 23 years.   White boom protects a small stream from one side of PorthChatham. Farther out, streamers of mousse snake toward sensitiveintertidal basins.   Near Elizabeth Island, unconnected to any land mass, severalhundred feet of boom known as ``sea curtain'' are temporarilyabandoned. Rough seas have prevented its use in conjunction withskimmer boats, and heavy oil streams by on either side.   The island's shore of shattered stone is a favorite spot for adwindling sea lion population.   Before English Bay, the oil peters out. Only the gleen ofreflected sunlight shines off the gently undulating sea.   A tiny necklace of orange boom chokes off the stream at the backof the lagoon adjacent to English Bay. Although few people live inthe village, it will be the largest population the oil hasencountered since it began streaming out of Prince William Sound acouple of weeks ago.   In contrast to the seeming indifference of English Bay, aroundthe corner Port Graham bristles against the threat. Cleanup crewsare mobilizing there for quick deployment.   Booms of various sizes and color sprawl disjointedly among thefleet of boats there to tend them. The crude log booms built inHomer Spit look like jumbles of matchsticks on an aquamarine tabletop.   The oil hasn't turned the corner into fish-laden Cook Inlet _Anchorage's outlet to the sea _ but it is hard to look uncriticallyat the surf-scarred beaches heading back toward Homer.   For a long time to come, every passerby will be looking for thetell-tale signs of oil instead of the raw beauty of the coast.</TEXT></DOC>
