 Post-processing takes generic CAMinstructions and converts them into a machine-specific format forthe specific machine tool being programmed.andP;  The cutter-locationfile, which contains the machine data for setting part parameters,moving the machine tools, setting cutting planes and tool pathsand programming all of the other machine movements, is processedinto machine specific form by post-processor programs.andP;  Theseprograms are provided by the machine vendors, generally for free.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer-aided manufacturingPostprocessorsApplications.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Bruce HaaseandM;Regardless of the computer-aided manufacturing package, before any chips arecut, holes drilled or parts turned, the files created by the CAM program mustbe post-processed.andM;In spite of its important role in the manufacturing process, many buyersunderstand very little about the post-interpreter/compiler between their CAMpackage and their machine tool.andP;  In fact, the &quot;post&quot; may be the leastunderstood software portion of the CAD/CAM equation.andM;&quot;The purpose of a post is to take a CL [cutter location] file that is genericin nature and translate that into code that is machine-specific,&quot; said FrankBakanau, the marketing development manager for Point Control Systems Inc., aCAM software developer in Eugene, Ore.andM;The cutter-location file represents the actual output file or finishedproduct of a CAM program.andP;  It contains data on part parameters, overallmachine-tool movements, cutting planes, tool path, feeds, speeds and spindlemovements -- everything that's required to machine a part.andM;However, because the CL file isn't specific for the machine tool until thatfile is &quot;posted,&quot; it doesn't speak the same language as the machine tool'scontrol.andP;  Once the post-processor completes the translation, the machine toolcan follow the instructions in the file created by the post and actually cut,mill, drill or turn the part created in the CAD/CAM program.andM;Every CAM system needs some type of translator to convert CAM files intonumerical machine-tool files, Bakanau explained.andM;&quot;The CL file is standard, but there are 25 or so different versions orvariations of that standard file&quot; depending on the CAM software, he said.andM;Adding to the complexity is the fact that machine-tool controls also speaktheir own unique language.andP;  Two milling machines, both having the samecapabilities and functions, often have different controls and thus needdifferent post-processor programs.andM;Putting both sides of the translation equation together means that the postmust be able to understand and communicate with a specific CL file producedby a CAM package and translate that file into definitive commands for aspecific machine-tool control.andM;The possible combinations are almost limitless.andP;  &quot;It's like not only knowingChinese, but all the different dialects of Chinese, and then being able totranslate any of those dialects into any other language and dialect spoken inthe world,&quot; said Charles Claydon, product manager for Tool Chest, a CAD/CAMprogram sold by Battelle Memorial Institute of Columbus, Ohio.andM;&quot;We have several hundred posts in our library,&quot; said Claydon.andP;  &quot;We don'tcharge customers for any of them.&quot;andM;Battelle will ship additional or different posts to customers as their needschange.andP;  &quot;We cover all of their machine tools at the time of the sale.andP;  Lateron, if a customer's requirements change, if he adds or changes equipment,we'll upgrade or change the post for him even if we have to custom-code it.&quot;andM;Battelle's post policy is more liberal than some.andP;  Point Control, forinstance, offers customers any post within its library, charging them onlyfor custom-coding.andM;&quot;We actually don't have post-processor,&quot; said Bakanau.andP;  &quot;We provide what wecall a code generator.andP;  Our users have told us that if it's driven by G codesor M codes [ANSI machine-tool languages], the code generator can run it.andM;&quot;We've found that the vast majority of customers can use the existing codegenerators.andP;  If there's an oddball [machine-tool] control out there that wedon't support, we usually charge around $1,000.&quot;andM;Since all CAM programs require some type of post-processing, it might beexpected that most vendors would have distribution and pricing policiessimilar to those offered by Battelle or Point Control, but such is not thecase.andM;Some vendors require the customer to buy the first post-processor, as well asany others needed to &quot;post&quot; to different machine tools.andP;  Other vendorsprovide the initial post-processor with their CAM software.andP;  Additional postsare available, but the customer has to buy them, and post-processors aren'tinexpensive.andP;  The software can range from $1,000 to $10,000.andM;If a vendor does charge customers for posts, the price can vary depending onthe type of post-processor provided.andM;Two categories of posts have evolved.andP;  One type is specific not only to theCAM program being used, but also to the machine tool and its specificoptions.andP;  Therefore, the post can be used for only one machine tool.andM;The other type of post is also specific to the CAM program, but is moregeneral in nature regarding the machine tool.andM;&quot;We offer both,&quot; said Claydon.andP;  &quot;The most popular is the customer-configured,or generic, post.&quot; Often this type of post processor is called a G-post.andM;&quot;We've just added our seventh system,&quot; said David Spaulding, CAD/CAM managerof Arbor Model and Tooling Inc. in Grand Rapids, Mich.andM;&quot;All our posts are G-posts.andP;  If a customer knows anything at all regardinghis machine, a G-post is the way to go.andP;  I can fine-tune the machine the wayI want to.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
