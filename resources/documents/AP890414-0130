James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service, said permission was given to theAgracetus Co., Middleton, Wis., for testing the new cotton varietyin Starkville, Miss., beginning immediately.   Glosser said the testing procedure was reviewed by his agencyand determined to be ``well designed and environmentally safe.''   The company's scientists inserted a gene into the cotton plantfrom a common soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringienensis. The geneproduces a protein that is toxic to caterpillar-type insects butnot to humans, mammals or most other insects.   Glosser said if the cotton performs as the company hopes, itwould mean the plants are protected against such pests as thebollworm, tobacco budworm and armyworm. The department estimatesthese pests cost U.S. cotton producers about $128 million in 1988,including lost yields and costs of insecticides.</TEXT></DOC>
