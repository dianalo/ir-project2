The announcement came a day after sources disclosed new concernsabout the segment's environmental liabilities that jeopardized theplanned sale of the business to a group led by its management.   British businessman Brian Beazer had counted on the sale of thebusiness to help finance his $1.8 billion takeover of Koppers Co.While Beazer was going to sell the business segment, he would haveretained responsibility for its past environmental liabilities.   Gordon Cain, head of Sterling Group of Houston and a specialistin chemicals industry buyouts, was to be an equity partner withmanagement.   Koppers said it is now free to consider other offers for thebusiness.   ``We have received a number of inquiries relating to thistransaction over a period of several months,'' Beazer said thismorning by telephone from Koppers' headquarters in Pittsburgh.   ``We have not pursued those inquiries because of our undertakingto give exclusivity to the management group,'' he said. ``It is ourintention to seek purchasers of a serious nature immediately, andthat is already under way.''   We do not expect any difficulty,'' Beazer said.   Beazer, who prevailed June 1 in a bitter takeover battle againstKoppers' former top management, declined today to say whether heintends to sell the chemicals group as an entity or in pieces.   He said Thursday that discussions about the chemicals buyoutwere continuing. But those last-ditch efforts proved fruitless.   One official at Koppers headquarters, who would not speak forattribution, said managers of the chemicals segment were being toldthat a financial consultant to the deal had raised new concernsabout the extent of Koppers' environmental liabilities. Thatapparently created differences over the agreed purchase price.   Breaking up the chemicals group would be a blow to the nearly2,700 Koppers employees who were expected to keep their jobs afterthe buyout.   The Pittsburgh company also has major interests in constructionmaterials, which Beazer wanted as an addition to his internationalconstruction operations.   Glen C. Tenley, slated to move from Koppers president and chiefoperating officer to president and chief executive of the newcompany, on Thursday referred questions to Beazer.   A Wall Street securities analyst who follows Koppers said he wasnot surprised by the reports that environmental issues were at theroot of the problem, although he said he was unaware of the snag.   ``The company doesn't know what the liabilities are. The EPAgets around to these plent sites one at a time, and until they getaround to some of these places, you don't know,'' he said, speakingon condition he not be named.   The analyst said Cain ``is a smart guy and usually he sets thesedeals so that the environmental liabilities are covered. He's beencareful about that because it's sucn an open-ended thing.''   Selling the chemicals businesses in pieces ``would take longer,but they might get a better price,'' he said.   In the battle against the Beazer group, Koppers' former topmanagement argued in court documents that with environmentalliabilities of $200 million over the next decade, the chemicalsbusiness could not survive without cash from the constructionmaterials business.   Tenley has estimated the segment's sales would grow from about$600 million in 1987 to $1 billion in the 1990s. It had operatingprofits of around $40 million last year.</TEXT></DOC>
