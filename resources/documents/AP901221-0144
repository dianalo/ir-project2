The National Safety Council each year estimates the number ofholiday traffic fatalities for the heavily traveled holiday period,which began at 6 p.m. Friday and ends at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday.   Last year, 372 people died during the three-day Christmasholiday.   This year's projection is higher because Christmas falls on aTuesday, extending the holiday period an additional day, saidcouncil statistician Terry Miller.   Safety officials say the death toll could be lower than inprevious four-day Christmas periods because high gasoline pricesmay deter people from making long car trips or from going to socialevents.   ``People may just decide to limit their driving to necessaryerrands, going to the store and other things of that nature,''Miller said. ``But it's hard to predict people's behavior in suchsituations.''   The council makes its projections by comparing the averagenumber of traffic deaths each day of the current year withhistorical figures on traffic fatalities during past holidayseasons.   The council also projects that between 350 and 450 people willdie in on the nation's roads during the four-day New Year holidayperiod.</TEXT></DOC>
