RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, broadly interpreting a keyfederal anti-racketeering law, made it easier today to use the lawin civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud.   The court said unanimously that the law applies to more than whatis traditionally described as organized crime.   Also, Justice William J. Brennan said for the court that to provea pattern of racketeering activity under the law, a privateplaintiff or a prosecutor must show at least two criminal acts``within a single scheme that were related and that amounted to, orthreatened the likelihood of, continued criminal activity.''   Brennan rejected arguments that a plaintiff or prosecutor mustprove ``separate illegal schemes'' to demonstrate a pattern ofracketeering activity.   Moreover, he continued, the law is designed to apply to more thantraditional organized crime.   ``The occasion for Congress' action was the perceived need tocombat organized crime,'' Brennan said. ``But Congress for cogentreasons chose to enact a more general statute, one which, althoughit had organized crime as its focus, was not limited in applicationto organized crime.''   The court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against NorthwesternBell Telephone Co. by Minnesota consumers. The suit was based onalleged violations of the federal Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act, or RICO.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, whichaccused Northwestern Bell of bribing state public utility officials.   The consumers say the phone company in 1980 began tryingillegally to win rate increases by offering gifts, employment andother favors to members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.   The appeals court ruled that the phone company's customers failedto prove ``a pattern of racketeering activity'' required to make acase under RICO.   The 8th Circuit court said a single fraudulent scheme isinsufficient, ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged.   Other federal appeals courts have allowed civil RICO suits basedon numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme.   It is not unusual nowadays to find at least one RICO claim inlawsuits involving virtually any business dispute. The stigmaattached to being linked in public court documents to allegedracketeering can be powerful leverage for out-of-court settlements.   Winners of RICO lawsuits may collect triple damages and lawyerfees, both of which generally are not available under stateanti-fraud laws.   Justice Department lawyers, in a friend-of-the-court briefsubmitted last year, sided with the phone customers in urging thejustices to interpret the RICO law broadly and reinstate the lawsuit.   Also backing the customers were 14 states _ Arizona, California,Connecticut, Idaho, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, NorthCarolina, Oregon, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin andWyoming.   Other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit. Forexample, the AFL-CIO said in a friend-of-the-court brief that``private civil RICO actions have become a tool of harassment ...against legitimate businesses and labor organizations.''   During an oral argument session before the justices lastNovember, a lawyer for Northwestern Bell said the 1970 law is aimedat thwarting organized crime, and should not be used againstotherwise legitimate businesses accused of fraud.   But the lawyer representing the company's customers saidbusinesses that engage in fraudulent acts ``forfeit the right tocall themselves legitimate.''   The case is H.J. Inc. vs. Northwestern Bell, 87-1252.</TEXT></DOC>
