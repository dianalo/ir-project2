Ask DAKA International Inc. A few years ago, the suburbanBoston company, which runs cafeterias and Fuddruckersrestaurants, nearly lost a major account when one of itswomen cafeteria workers married a man with AIDS. Co-workersrefused to work with her, and customers picketed thecafeteria. The woman ultimately quit; and, as a result, DAKAdidn't lose the contract.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the nightmare lingered for DAKA executives, whoknew it was only a matter of time before some members of itsyoung work force, who served food and made sandwiches andpizza, would themselves contract AIDS. &quot;I lived in fear ofword getting out that a chef had AIDS, and we'd lose all ourcustomers,&quot; says DAKA President Allen R. Maxwell.   But instead of taking a hush-hush approach, the companyopenly concedes that AIDS is a problem. It has an AIDS-policyoffice for confidential counseling of employees and anin-house AIDS hotline. DAKA, which employs about 9,000, saysat least 100 employees have told supervisors that they testedpositive for HIV or have AIDS -- and that doesn't include theweekly anonymous calls to the hotline from infected employeesafraid they may lose their jobs and benefits and bestigmatized by co-workers.   DAKA knows of four AIDS-related employee deaths. &quot;It'senough people {with the AIDS virus or AIDS itself} that we'realmost always dealing with the issue,&quot; says William H.Baumhauer, DAKA's chairman and chief executive officer.   Under DAKA's AIDS policy, infected workers can stay intheir jobs as long as they are physically able and take paidleaves of absence when they are too weak to work. &quot;Mostbusinesses don't have AIDS policies. They're dealing with iton an ad hoc basis and a lot of things fall through thecracks,&quot; says Robert A. Kaiser, director of services for theNational Leadership Coalition on AIDS, whose board includesMr. Baumhauer.   According to Mr. Kaiser and other AIDS activists,companies other than DAKA that have adopted progressive AIDSpolicies include Wells Fargo Bank, Kaiser Foundation HealthPlan Inc., Pacific Bell, Digital Equipment Corp. and LeviStrauss International.   The food-services industry is particularly sensitive toAIDS since many consumers mistakenly believe the disease canbe transmitted by handling food. As a result, mostfood-service companies are loath to even mention the disease.   Furthermore, AIDS activists say the industry is adding tothe AIDS hysteria by ignoring well-known facts about how thedisease is transmitted. For instance, the 18,000-memberNational Restaurant Association, while acknowledging thatAIDS isn't spread by &quot;food, drink or casual contact,&quot; wantedthe right to fire food-service employees who had AIDS or anyother communicable disease.   &quot;The unfortunate reality is that there are Americans whopanic at the mention of the word AIDS,&quot; the association saidin a 1990 flier urging an amendment to the Americans WithDisabilities Act. DAKA was the only association member topublicly oppose the failed amendment.   &quot;There are other companies out there that don't care,&quot;said John Lojko in an interview shortly before he diedearlier this month at the age of 36. Mr. Lojko, a former DAKAdistrict manager, had been diagnosed with AIDS three yearsago. He said he realized that keeping employees with AIDS isfinancially risky for a company. He said his own medicalbills, covered by DAKA's insurance program, would exceed$50,000 this year.   &quot;Most people have to keep their mouths shut so they won'tlose their insurance,&quot; Mr. Lojko said. In his case, he said,DAKA created a new job auditing accounts at companyheadquarters when he no longer had the strength to bedistrict manager.   DAKA is still trying to determine the cost of itsAIDS-related medical services, but one thing is certain:&quot;It's a major component of our health costs,&quot; says Mr.Maxwell. Lewis Maltby, director of the American CivilLiberties Union's National Workplace Rights office, says,&quot;The business community is terrified of AIDS for economicreasons. It didn't used to be that terrible because peopledidn't live very long. Now people are living longer and thecost of AZT {a drug used to treat AIDS} is phenomenal.&quot;   What's more, &quot;There've been a lot of cases offood-industry people being subject to pickets, violence,boycotts and dramatic declines in clientele and revenuebecause the community thought they had persons with HIV,&quot;says Larry Gostin, executive director of the American Societyof Law and Medicine and professor of health law at Harvard.He says that so far, however, courts have defended rights ofthose with AIDS to work in the food industry as long as theydon't pose an obvious risk to the general public.   DAKA believes its policy will save money in the long termby avoiding the cost of defending civil-rights lawsuits bystricken employees and by preventing a mass exodus offrightened workers. &quot;We've taken it out of the closet,&quot; saysMr. Baumhauer. &quot;But the fear is still there on both sides.For the infected person it's `What does this mean relative tomy life, my job and my family?' For co-workers it's `How's itgoing to affect me?'&quot;   Louise A. Faucher, who runs DAKA's AIDS program, recalls apregnant DAKA employee who balked at working with a co-workerwho had tested positive for HIV because she was afraid herfetus might be affected. Ultimately, she was persuaded tostay on the job.   In another case, a 22-year-old cafeteria worker says thatat first he &quot;was worried about using one of the cuttingboards&quot; after a co-worker with AIDS had used it. &quot;But afterabout a week or two it was, like, fine, he has AIDS, we'lljust deal with it,&quot; the man says. And in yet another instanceof panic, a Fuddruckers customer found chewing gum stuck tosome broccoli and sued DAKA, alleging the gum could havecarried saliva tainted by the AIDS virus. The suit wentnowhere. Mr. Maxwell says DAKA hasn't lost a single accountas a result of its AIDS policy.   With all the training, it's still a struggle for DAKAemployees to deal with AIDS in the workplace. One districtvice president refused to discuss the company'sAIDS-education program when making sales pitches to potentialnew accounts because he thought it would work against him.But the one occasion when he was persuaded to include it inhis pitch, he won a significant account, Mrs. Faucherrecalls.   A 56-year-old DAKA worker in a New England collegecafeteria recalls feeling horrified when she found out that a30-year-old co-worker, with whom she had worked six years,had AIDS. She feared for her safety, worrying that theinfected man would somehow transmit his disease to herthrough knives, dishes and food he handled, or even the air.She felt somewhat reassured when the company restructured histasks so he wasn't using sharp utensils, thinking he would beless likely to cut himself and bleed.   But doubts lingered. On the advice of a supervisor, thewoman contacted an AIDS hotline. She also spoke to a familydoctor. After being reminded that the odds were virtuallyzero of contracting the disease by working with the man, saysthe woman, &quot;I didn't worry any more.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
