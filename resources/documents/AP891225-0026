The people who held the men for four days ``cried hysterically''when freeing them Saturday, 33-year-old Jon Meyersohn told a newsconference Sunday.   ``Evidently they couldn't find anyone to negotiate with,''Meyersohn said. ``They didn't really know what to do with us, theyjust knew they had a hot property.''   Meyersohn and Doug Mullen, a GTE executive, were seizedWednesday at the Marriott hotel in Panama City by paramilitaryforces loyal to deposed strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Theywere released unharmed Saturday.   At a news conference at CBS in New York, Meyersohn said he andMullen were tied up, threatened and psychologically abused but werenot physically harmed during their four-day ordeal.   He said his captors appeared disorganized and confused beforesurrendering to U.S. Embassy officials Saturday afternoon.   ``Everyone was in tears,'' Meyersohn said.   Meyersohn said his captors, armed with AK-47 and M16 automaticrifles as well as hand grenades, told them: ``We just want peopleto understand what we're going through. Tell the world we just wantdignity, we don't want to be a colonial nation.''   At least 24 U.S. servicemen have been killed and about 280injured since the United States invaded and occupied Panama lateTuesday and installed the civilian government of PresidentGuillermo Endara.   Just hours after Meyersohn's Sunday news conference, U.S.officials announced Noriega had turned himself in to the Vaticanmission in Panama and requested political asylum.   Meyersohn and Mullen were abducted at about 9 a.m. Wednesday bymembers of Noriega's so-called Dignity Battalions. Meyersohn saidhe, Mullen and two others were first driven to a Panamanian DefenseForces building.   ``There were guns everywhere, guns in our faces, and we heardthreats like `we're going to kill the gringos,''' Meyersohn said.   They were marched up six flights of steps, ordered to sit withtheir hands on their heads and interrogated, he said.   Meyersohn said that at one point a captain of the PanamanianDefense Forces took Mullen and Meyersohn aside and told them inEnglish, ``We need you as a hostage to bargain for.''   The two Americans were then tied up with their shoelaces, takenback to the pickup truck, made to lie beneath a tarpaulin anddriven away. Later they were driven about 30 minutes into thecountryside.   The Americans were taken to three other locations, including ajungle clearing, where they were tied up. On Saturday they weretaken to the apartment of a Panamanian friend of Mullen, whonegotiated their release.   Meyersohn said that while in captivity he thought often of the15 hostages held in Lebanon, particularly about Terry Anderson, thechief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who hasbeen held since 1985.   ``I'll never look at a hostage situation in the same wayagain,'' Meyersohn said.</TEXT></DOC>
