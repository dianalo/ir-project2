Thisthesis sets out to study the very nature of retrieval. Formal specificationsthat capture certain informal intuitions about retrieval are developed,studied, and implemented by retrieval algorithms. Consistent with thenecessity for fast retrieval is the guiding intuition that a retrieveris, at least in simple cases, a pattern matcher, though in more complexcases it may perform selected inferences such as property inheritance.Seemingly at odds with this intuition, this thesis views the entire processof retrieval as a form of inference and hence the KB as a representation,not merely a data structure. A retriever makes a limited attempt to provethat a queried sentence is a logical consequence of the KB. The techniquesof model theory are adapted to build non-procedural specifications ofretrievability relations, which determine what sentences are retrievablefrom the KB's. Model-theoretic specifications are presented for fourretrievers, each extending the capabilities of the previous one.</TEXT></DOC>
