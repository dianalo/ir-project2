But none had to rely solely on aSenate salary.   According to financial disclosure statements made public Friday,perhaps one-third of the 100 senators are millionaires and mostothers are wealthy.   Most have impressive investments.   And most routinely accepted speaking fees and travelreimbursements from special-interest groups.   Here's how some senators supplemented their $89,500 Senatepaychecks last year:   _Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., earned $15,000 as a lecturer at C.W.Post College in Long Island, N.Y.   _Donald Riegle, D-Mich., made 21 speeches at $1,000 apiece toWashington Campus, a nonprofit educational organization thatconducts seminars.   _Paul Simon, D-Ill., reported $3,042 in residuals from fourappearances on ``Saturday Night Live.''   _Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, grossed $65,000 from five farms butafter subtracting expenses was left with only $6,000.   _Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., reaped $1,760 selling hay off his farm.   _Bennett Johnston, D-La., who heads the Senate Energy Committee,pocketed $377 in oil-well royalties.   _Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, earned$22,500 in royalties from ``Men of Zeal,'' a book he wrote with hisMaine colleague, Republican Sen. William Cohen, which reflectedtheir service on the Senate committee that investigated theIran-Contra affair.   _Cohen listed $25,763 in royalties, including some still comingin from a novel he co-authored with ex-Sen. Gary Hart.   _Alan Cranston, D-Calif., received $62,906 in pension from hisservice as a California state official and $18,246 in SocialSecurity benefits.   _Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who lost a leg in the Vietnam war,reported $18,972 from a Navy pension.   Almost all the 95 senators who filed the required statements(five were granted extensions) reported receiving honoraria _ whichusually were fees for making speeches to schools, churches andspecial-interest groups.   Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, listed $46,950 in such fees, including $10,000 fromelements of the defense industry. Under the rules, he could keeponly $35,800, so he gave $11,686 to charity.   Richard Lugar of Indiana, senior Republican on the AgricultureCommittee and former chairman of Foreign Relations, picked up$72,950 for speaking and turned over $37,189 to charity. Hisaudiences ranged from the National Pork Producers Council to theNational Association of Arab Americans.   Wendell Ford of Kentucky, a senior member of the CommerceCommittee, reported $28,500 for speeches, many of them to regulatedgroups, including the alcohol and tobacco industries that areeconomic powers in his home state.   Jake Garn, R-Utah, former chairman of the Banking Committee, wasa favorite speaker at financial and banking meetings. He was paid$37,700 and gave $2,000 to charity.   Tom Daschle, D-S.D., a freshman who serves on the FinanceCommittee, accepted five expense-paid trips, four of them with hiswife. They included stops in Puerto Rico, in Louisville for theKentucky Derby, in Fort Lauderdale and Miami.   Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and his wife accepted a free five-day tripto Paris in connection with American Airlines' launching non-stopservice from Nashville to Paris.   Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., was reimbursed by non-government interestsfor trips to Cuba, San Francisco and Fayetteville, Ark.   Not everything senators touched turned to gold last year.Freshman Herbert Kohl, a multimillionaire, did well with his bakerystock but his Milwaukee Bucks National Basketball Associationfranchise lost $95,000, although it generated revenues of $12.1million.   In most cases, it is next to impossible to tell a senator'sfinancial condition from the disclosure statements. Items ofincome, assets and liabilities are listed in broad brackets. Thus,$6,000 interest earned shows up with a value of $5,001 to $15,000.A $10 million gain from a property sale would be listed only asworth $250,001 and up.   Some of the wealthiest senators have assets in trusts. So, thestatement of Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., gives no clue that he hasan interest in trusts worth tens of millions of dollars. He has noliabilities.   Similarly, the extensive wealth of Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., istied up in trusts.   When trusts are excluded, Kohl could be the richest senator,with assets of up to nearly $28 million and liabilities of lessthan $2 million. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., whose grandfather foundedRalston Purina, lists assets of up to $13 million and noliabilities.   John Heinz, R-Pa., whose family started and still owns a largeblock of H.J. Heinz Co., the ketchup-and-pickle giant, reportedassets of at least $11.2 million and perhaps $13.6 million, withliabilities of about $1 million.   Nancy L. Kassebaum, R-Kan., who owns real estate and a Wichitaradio station, listed assets of up to $4 million with maximumliabilities of under $1.5 million.   Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., one of the poorer members, said sheowns shares in a gold fund, but took pains to add the fund has noinvestments in South Africa.   Gifts worth nearly $5,000 were reported by Republican Leader BobDole of Kansas. They included seven lithographs, a dozen silk tiesworth $240, a hand-tailored suit valued at $600, two cases ofchampagne worth $888 and a $200 pencil drawing of himself.   Phil Gramm, R-Texas, reported receiving a gift of steaks worth$240. Simon, the Illinois senator whose bowtie is a trademark,accepted a bowtie quilt of unknown value. Carl Levin, D-Mich., saidhis wife won two airline tickets worth $1,858 in a raffle. ArlenSpecter, R-Pa., said his assets include a 1976 Jaguar, which hevalued at under $5,000.   Among the assets listed by Pete Domenici, R-N.M.: a mausoleumcrypt worth less than $5,000.</TEXT></DOC>
