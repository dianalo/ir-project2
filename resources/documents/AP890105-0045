Shultz wasembarking today on a mission to persuade more than 100 nations toimpose sanctions on countries that use poison gas.   He also planned to urge foreign ministers and ambassadorsassembling for a five-day conference in Paris to strengthen the handof U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in investigatingallegations of chemical warfare.   The skirmish Wednesday over the Mediterranean in which U.S. Navyjet fighters shot down two Libyan MiG-23 planes acted as a backdropfor the conference, which opens Saturday.   William Burns, director of the U.S. arms control agency,acknowledged that decisions at the meeting will be by consensus.This means any nation, including Libya, can block proposals.   ``I don't know how successful we will be, and I don't know howmuch of a resonant chord this will strike in the hearts of otherparticipants,'' Burns told reporters Wednesday at the StateDepartment.   Still, Burns said, Shultz will push for sanctions under theUnited Nations charter and for additional powers for the U.N.Secretary-General.   The Paris conference was proposed by President Reagan inSeptember to draw international attention to the spreading use ofchemical weapons. The focus then was on Iraq, which was accused of _and denied _ devastating Iranian troops and civilians with poisongas.   For the last two months, however, the United States has putspecial stress on Libya and a plant at Rabta, south of Tripoli, theState Department claims has recently begun limited production ofchemical weapons.   Even before U.S. jets shot down the Libyan fighter planes nearCrete on Wednesday, the Reagan administration had servednot-so-subtle notice to the world that it considers MoammarGadhafi's drive to produce poison gas _ an allegation the Libyanleader has consistently denied _ a serious threat to world stability.   Shultz, in an interview on the eve of his departure, told TheWashington Post the administration was raising ``a big stew'' overthe plant because of Libya's ``known connections to terroristgroups.''   After the clash, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and othersenior U.S. officials sought to separate the incident from thedrumbeat of alarm the Reagan administration has sounded over thesuspected chemical weapons facility.   The Libyan plant controversy is bound to have an impact on theconference. And yet, Burns said ``it is not aimed at bashing aparticular country.''   Referring to the air clash, Burns added: ``I don't see it asreally germane to the conference. I think that other nations willnot see it as germane as well.''   Carlucci, at a news conference at the Pentagon, said the Libyanjets had approached the U.S. F-14 Tomcats at high speed and in ``ahostile manner'' in international airspace.   He said the Navy planes acted solely in self-defense. Based onpreliminary reports, the MiGs activated their radar before theTomcats opened fire with air-to-air missiles, Carlucci said.   Congressional leaders said the United States had actedappropriately, but expressed concern that the incident might portendfurther hostilities with Libya.   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said ``Congress shouldbe informed ... if the United States is engaged in a piecemealescalation of our conflict with Libya beyond these legitimate actsof self-defense.''   Libya, meanwhile, condemned the U.S. firing as a premeditatedattack, and Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, declared his North Africannation would ``meet challenge with challenge.''   ``If America has prevailed because it is a superpower in the airand the sea, it will inevitably be defeated in Libya,'' Gadhafisaid. ``We, as well as the fish, are awaiting them.''   European officials reacted cautiously to the incident, whileIsrael applauded the U.S. action and Yasser Arafat, chairman of thePalestine Liberiation Organization, and the Arab world sharplycriticized the United States.   The downing of the two Libyan jets kept attention fastened on thesuspected Libyan chemical plant as delegates to the Paris conferencebegan assembling.   Shultz, who will be in Paris through Sunday, will urgeindustrialized countries to deny technology to other nations bent ondeveloping chemical weapons. Charles E. Redman, the State Departmentspokesman, said the key to the Libyan situation was to depriveGadhafi of the equipment, material and expertise to produce poisongas.   ``If these kind of things are going to be cut off it's going tobe very difficult for a plant of this kind to operate,'' he said.   The 1925 Geneva Protocol under review in Paris bans the use ofchemical weapons, but does not outlaw their production. Some 20nations, by U.S. estimate, either have produced chemical weapons orare capable of manufacturing them.   The protocol has no enforcement mechanism. Its effectivenessdepends on the self-discipline of the 130 nations that are partiesto the pact.   To try to stem proliferation, Redman said ``we are prepared todiscuss the strongest possible measures'' against countries thatexport sophisticated technology.   The West European governments have responded with some skepticismto the U.S. allegations, however. West German Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher said Wednesday his government had no evidenceproving West German pharmaceutical firm had helped build the plantat Rabta. A spokesman for Genscher said, meanwhile, Bonn had accusedWashington for ``additional material'' to back up the allegation.   But the Reagan administration has not pulled back.   Robert M. Gates, a former CIA deputy director who was named lastweek as deputy director of the National Security Council, said in arecent speech that the plant was built with the help of ``nearly adozen nations, East and West.'' He declined to name them.   The United States stopped production of chemical weapons in 1969,then resumed 17 years later on the grounds the Soviet Union andother potential adversaries had chemical weapons stocks. Currently,U.S. chemical components and artillery shells to contain them arebeing produced but stockpiled separately.   The Soviet Union acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemicalweapons, then claimed to have ceased production. A foreign ministryspokesman said 50,000 tons would be stored, the rest destroyed.   Officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in Genevato plan ways to restrict proliferation.</TEXT></DOC>
