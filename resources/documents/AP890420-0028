HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three evil-tasting tablespoons of herring oil eachday can lower mildly elevated blood pressure, providing some of thebest evidence yet that fish oil is good for the heart, scientistsreported today.   Although the seeming benefits of fish oil have been widelytouted, little hard evidence has been offered to back up theseclaims. Now, two researchers skeptical about fish oil's powers saythey have surprised even themselves by finding that it seems towork.   Their study, conducted on 32 men, found that big daily doses canreturn mild high blood pressure to normal levels. It appeared towork about as well as diuretics or the beta blocker propranolol,two medicines widely prescribed for high blood pressure.   ``It opens the possibility that this type of therapy mayultimately find a place in the treatment of high blood pressure,''said Dr. Garret A. FitzGerald, who with Dr. Howard R. Knappconducted the study at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.   ``It's an important first step in that direction,'' FitzGeraldsaid. ``Given an adequate dosage, fish oil appears to lower bloodpressure in people with elevated high blood pressure.''   The amount of fish oil used in this experiment was much higherthan that recommended by manufacturers of the fish oil gel capsulessold in grocery stores and pharmacies. In fact, when taken at thedose usually suggested, the oil did not help.   Other studies have suggested that fish oil can prevent heartdisease by repairing damaged arteries, lowering dangerously highcholesterol levels and making the blood more slow to clot.   Despite their encouraging findings, the Vanderbilt researcherssaid people should not exchange their blood pressure pills for fishoil until doctors know more about its effectiveness and safety.   At Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, Dr. Richard Pasternak notedthat several large studies are under way, adding:   ``This research is consistent with other experimental evidence,and this is an important break in that regard.''   According to the latest report, published in today's New EnglandJournal of Medicine, a month of fish oil lowered the men's averageblood pressure from the starting point of 139 over 94 to 132 over90.   To achieve this, they had to take three tablespoons of herringoil daily. The liquid oil, which caused belching and a lingeringfishy aftertaste, is not widely available because it spoils quickly.   The amount taken is the equivalent of 50 fish oil gel capsules,like those sold in supermarkets and drugstores. Knapp said takingthat many is impractical because big doses of them often causeupset stomachs.   The doctors also cautioned that people should not substitute codliver oil, which contains too much vitamin A and D and not enoughomega-3 fatty acids. Oily ocean fish, such as herring and mackerel,are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the particular variety of fish oilthat appears to be good for the heart.   Herring oil used in the study was about 30 percent omega-3. Thedoctors noted that more concentrated kinds of fish oil are becomingavailable. These may allow people to get fish oil's benefits whiletaking less.   ``Fish oil is not the drug of choice for treating hypertension,but the study shows that that dietary change can markedly reduceour risk of high blood pressure,'' said Dr. Mark Milner ofWashington Hospital Center.</TEXT></DOC>
