These days, Mr. Robertson treats the little guydifferently. A recent day finds him backing his train into asiding east of town to pick up just two carloads of pulpwood,then dropping off a single empty lumber car in the town ofIdabel. Spotting a group of children on the tracks, he stopsthe train and leaps off to scold them. There's another delaywhile he backs up so his conductor can jump down and sliceoff some peppertree bark, which he chews to ease a toothache.</LP><TEXT>   That kind of laid-back operation might drive a bigrailroad into bankruptcy. But Mr. Robertson now works for atiny line called the Kiamichi Railroad, which has bought thistrack from Burlington Northern. And though it operates in adepressed area of cattle ranches and piney woods, it isturning a profit, while winning the loyalty of shippers andtownsfolk.   The Kiamichi (French for an extinct local woodpecker) isrepresentative of the newly evolving railroad industry. Thenation's big railroads grew by combining short lines intolong ones. Now many are selling off weaker operations, whichbecome short-haul, low-volume -- and often quite profitable-- carriers. Today short lines operate 24% of the nation'strack, up from 6% two decades ago, according to theAssociation of American Railroads.   &quot;We're changing the whole image of railroading,&quot; says JackL. Hadley, the Kiamichi's president and the leader of thegroup that formed it in 1987. Economists agree. They say Mr.Hadley and people like him are reducing transport costs,preserving rail service and jobs in rural America and showinghow railroads can stay competitive in the 1990s.   But there are critics, too. Edward Wytkind, executivedirector of the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department,says short lines have &quot;splintered the railroad system,displaced thousands of workers and left track in the hands ofpoorly capitalized, poorly maintained railroad companies onedisaster from bankruptcy.&quot;   The Burlington Northern was eager to dispose of what isnow the Kiamichi: two lines totaling 230 miles, one runningfrom Lakeside, Okla., to Hope, Ark., and another fromAntlers, Okla., to Paris, Texas. Mr. Hadley and his grouppaid $10 million to the giant carrier, which lent them 60% ofit. Mr. Hadley holds 70% of the Kiamichi, with the rest ownedby eight current and former holders of Anacostia andamp; PacificCo., a New York transportation-investment firm.   Once in control, Mr. Hadley, a 37-year veteran ofshort-line railroads in the Northeast, went to work quickly.As the chief of a new railroad, he could replace unionizedworkers with nonunion employees earning 40% less, and couldoperate without the work rules and manning levels that haveplagued big railroads. He used the savings to double trainfrequency and hold down rates while launching an aggressivemarketing program to lure back shippers that had defected totrucks and other railroads.   Carloadings, which had been declining under BurlingtonNorthern's management, grew to 33,500 last year from 18,000in 1986. The Burlington Northern says it can't calculatewhether the lines made or lost money for it, but as anindependent, the Kiamichi earned $1.2 million on revenue of$9.6 million last year.   Short lines such as the Kiamichi, says John Hall, a vicepresident of Burlington Northern, &quot;raise the question of canJoe Blow run a railroad better than we can.&quot; He adds that Mr.Hadley has the &quot;flexibility to provide a different type ofservice than we could provide.&quot;   Concern over that flexibility was exactly why townsfolk inHugo tried to block creation of the Kiamichi with protestmeetings and objections to the Interstate Commerce Commissionand, Mr. Hadley says, chains and logs on the tracks. Theyfeared Mr. Hadley's plans to operate the lines with half asmany employees. The loudest objections came from rail workersfacing big pay cuts. &quot;It was just a sham deal to take awayour seniority and cut our salary in half,&quot; says Jackie DavidPeddy, a conductor who now commutes three hours a day to keephis $50,000-a-year job with the Burlington Northern.   Today, however, Mr. Hadley is popular in Hugo, a town of7,172 where the two lines cross and where the Kiamichi hasits headquarters and main freight yard. Employment, slashedafter the takeover, has climbed back to 75 full-timepositions, almost as many as Burlington had here. TheKiamichi buys its fuel oil, copying machines, stationery andautomobiles locally. Shippers praise the expanded service.Now local boosters say the Kiamichi has become an importantindustrial-development tool.   Mr. Hadley cultivates this local popularity. The Kiamichisponsors the first prize for bull-riding at Hugo's annualrodeo, and, for a nominal fee, runs a weekend tourist trainfrom the town's restored depot.   Kiamichi officials regularly visit even small shippers andtry to be of help. To a big railroad, &quot;we're just a number intheir computer, but we're a pretty good-sized customer tothese people,&quot; says Ted Kirkpatrick, who owns a feed-additivecompany. Last August he relocated the business to a sitealong the Kiamichi, moving it from its location along thetrack of a big railroad.   Martin Fry, who owns a pulpwood yard in Fort Towson,Okla., says Burlington Northern trains often rushed pastwithout stopping. &quot;They had half a dozen excuses. The trainwas too big to stop, or they didn't have time. The Kiamichitreats small customers a whole lot better.&quot;   On at least one occasion, the Kiamichi sent a locomotiveto Madill, Okla., to rush a single hopper car of flour to alocal Campbell Soup Co. plant that was about to run out. Italso provides just-in-time delivery of tin plate to theplant. And it has reduced freight rates by establishingconnections to a number of mainline railroads, much to thesurprise of Burlington Northern officials accustomed tothinking of the feeder line as their own.   Weyerhaeuser Co. has capitalized on the Kiamichi'smultiple connections to play off one big railroad againstanother, driving down shipping costs by 5% to 20%. DavidGiorgi, a transportation analyst at the forest-productscompany, says the Kiamichi is &quot;much more open to help usdevelop new markets.&quot; Burlington Northern disdained themeager revenue from interconnecting with the Santa Fe Railwayfor freight moving to California. But the Kiamichi, eager tooblige, has increased its revenue from Weyerhaeuser.   But some shippers resist using the Kiamichi because itcan't take their goods all the way, as a truck can. &quot;Kiamichican provide excellent service in its own area, but once theshipment gets on a long-haul railroad, I start chewing mynails,&quot; says Carl Lucas, transportation manager of Campbell'sParis, Texas, plant. Though Campbell increased inbound railshipments of ingredients and tin plate on the Kiamichi, thefood company hasn't restored a siding for outbound shipmentsthat had been removed to make room for truck loading docks.   Undaunted, Mr. Hadley recently visited Mr. Lucas, arguingthat even if Campbell didn't use the siding, &quot;it's a realdeterrent to keep the {truckers} from getting too greedy.&quot;Mr. Lucas acknowledges that Mr. Hadley &quot;may eventually wearus down.&quot;   Though the Kiamichi turned a profit right from the start,it has been low on cash because of simultaneous needs torepay debt and fix track. Years of deferred maintenance underBurlington Northern, and south-eastern Oklahoma's rainyclimate, have slowed the track work. Keeping tracks out ofthe mud is &quot;a never-ending battle,&quot; says transportationmanager Claude Griggs. Because beavers building dams alongthe tracks have caused several costly floods, the Kiamichioccasionally pays a $25-a-pelt bounty to a local trapper.   So, despite relatively large expenditures, parts of theline are still rough. &quot;When we get past one {speedrestriction}, we have to slow down for the next,&quot; says Mr.Robertson, the engineer. Also reflecting the road's limitedfinancial resources are its ragtag, though freshly painted,second-hand locomotives.   Partly because of its cash squeeze, the Kiamichi hasstretched out some payments to other railroads for jointfreight shipments. The cash problem was aggravated in 1990when the road spent $700,000 to restore a mile of trackwashed away by a flood on the Red River.   Nevertheless, Mr. Hadley acquired a dilapidated Santa Feline in 1990 and created the Chaparral Railroad, which linksup with the Kiamichi at Paris and runs 61 miles towardDallas. &quot;I have no desire to create an empire,&quot; he says. &quot;Ifwe became a really big outfit, we might lose some of ourability to perform.&quot; Rather, his goal was to improve theKiamichi's access to the Southwest; he believes that furthertraffic gains depend partly on his ability to extendconnections to other railroads.   The 65-year-old Mr. Hadley tackles problems withenthusiasm. He has long wanted to make changes inrailroading. A math major at Holy Cross College in Worcester,Mass., he operated LTV Corp.'s steel-hauling railroads untilretiring in 1987. On some LTV lines, he departed from theindustry's rigid craft distinctions by cross-trainingemployees and creating the all-purpose job of &quot;railroader.&quot;   &quot;A person who can do a lot of jobs will stay employed&quot;during a business slowdown, he says. That principle has beenput into practice on the Kiamichi, which avoided layoffs evenwhen its biggest customer, a coal-fired utility at FortTowson, shut down for 75 days. Idled train crews kept busyfixing freight cars and track.   The Kiamichi gets praise from some workers. It built arepair shop in Hugo so they wouldn't have to fix locomotivesand freight cars in the rain. And it has improved the crewlounge with showers, air conditioning and a microwave oven.The company offers a profit-sharing plan, tuition paymentsfor employees and their families and regular hours for traincrews used to erratic schedules with the Burlington Northern.Another perk: free wooden crossties for fence building.   Some employees say the Kiamichi tries to cultivate afamily atmosphere, in contrast to the military-stylediscipline of large railroads. &quot;That happens. Don't worryabout it,&quot; Mr. Hadley tells a carman whose failure to reportsticking brakes on a coal car caused more than $10,000 inwheel damage. Later, Mr. Hadley says, &quot;What good does it doto punish a guy who is already saying mea culpa?&quot;   &quot;Money-wise, I liked the Burlington Northern, butpeople-wise, I like working for this outfit,&quot; says JohnnyJames, a locomotive engineer who earns $25,000 to $30,000 ayear at the Kiamichi, down from $45,000 at BurlingtonNorthern. With the Kiamichi, he says, &quot;There's more business,and we'll get raises later.&quot;   The Kiamichi is a family business in another way, too. Mr.Hadley's son-in-law, James Shaffer, is vice president,administration, and heir apparent. Mr. Hadley's daughter,Judy Shaffer, handles the Kiamichi's public relations andreal-estate matters while working as an animal rehabilitator.His son Tom is a lawyer who works one day a week for theKiamichi. Another son, Ken, was the chief mechanical officeruntil he was sidetracked last October by injuries and jobstress. &quot;Stress and I never got along, and railroading ispure stress,&quot; he says.   A case in point: Some townspeople still think they aredealing with the well-endowed Burlington Northern when theymake damage claims against the Kiamichi. &quot;We find we neverhit a cow that isn't a prize animal,&quot; Jack Hadley says.</TEXT></DOC>
