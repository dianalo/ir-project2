The principal proposal would exempt from the premerger notificationobligations all acquisitions of 10% or less of an issuer's voting securitieson the grounds that such acquisitions are unlikely to violate the antitrustlaws. The alternative proposals would alter existing notification proceduresfor acquisitions of 10% or less of an issuer's voting securities. One wouldpermit the purchase, but require that the securities be placed in escrowpending antitrust review; the other would eliminate the reporting requirementimposed on the target firm, thus freeing the acquiror of its obligationto give the target prior notice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date: </T2>Comments must be received on or before November 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>addresses: </T2>Written comments should be submitted to both (1) theSecretary, Federal Trade Commission, Room 136, Washington, DC 20580, and(2) the Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice,Room 3214, Washington, DC 20530. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact: </T2>Kenneth M.

The Commission has determined thatnone of the amendments is a major rule, as that term is defined in ExecutiveOrder 12291. The amendments will not result in: an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies,or geographic regions; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in the domestic market.None of the proposed amendments expands the coverage of the premerger notificationrules in a way that would affect small business. Therefore, pursuant tosection 605(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), asadded by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354 (September 19,1980), the Federal Trade Commission certifies that these rules will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Section 603 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 603, requiringa final regulatory flexibility analysis of some rules, is therefore inapplicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification rules and report form containinformation collection requirements as defined by the Paperwork ReductionAct, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3518. These requirements were reviewed and approvedby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Control No. 3084-0005). Becausethe proposed amendments would affect the information collection requirementof the premerger notification program, the proposed amendments have beensubmitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct. The Supporting Statement accompanying the Request for OMB Review estimatesthe principal proposal would reduce the number of notifications required,on average, by 20 filings per year. This would reduce the existing burdenestimate of 142,000 hours annually by about 800 hours. The two alternativesbeing considered would not materially change the current burden estimate.Each of those proposed procedures would be optional if adopted. Personswho wish to do so could continue to file notifications under existing procedures.Comments on the Commission's submission may be directed to the Office ofInformation and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington,DC 20503, Attention: Don Arbuckle, Desk Officer for the Federal Trade Commission.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Section 7A of the Clayton Act (``the act''), 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added bysections 201 and 202 of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Actof 1976, requires persons contemplating certain acquisitions of assetsor voting securities to give advance notice to the Federal Trade Commission(hereafter referred to as ``the Commission'') and the Assistant AttorneyGeneral in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice(hereafter referred to as ``the Assistant Attorney General''), and to waitcertain designated periods before the consummation of such acquisitions.The transactions to which the advance notice requirement is applicableand the length of the waiting period required are set out respectivelyin subsections (a) and (b) of section 7A. This amendment to the ClaytonAct does not change the standards used in determining the legality of mergersand acquisitions under the antitrust laws. The legislative history suggests several purposes underlying the act. Congresswanted to assure that large acquisitions were subjected to meaningful scrutinyunder the antitrust laws prior to consummation. To this end, Congress clearlyintended to eliminate the large ``midnight merger,'' which is negotiatedin secret and announced just before, or sometimes only after, the closingtakes place. Congress also provided an opportunity for the Commission orthe Assistant Attorney General (who are sometimes hereafter referred tocollectively as the ``antitrust agencies'' or the ``enforcement agencies'')to seek a court order enjoining the completion of those transactions thatthe agencies deem to present significant antitrust problems. Finally, Congresssought to facilitate an effective remedy when a challenge by one of theenforcement agencies proved successful. Thus, the act requires that theantitrust agencies receive prior notification of significant acquisitions,provides certain tools to facilitate a prompt, thorough investigation ofthe competitive implications of these acquisitions, and assures the enforcementagencies an opportunity to seek a preliminary injunction before the partiesto an acquisition are legally free to consummate it, reducing the problemof unscrambling the assets after the transaction has taken place. Subsection7A(d)(1) of the act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(d)(1), directs the Commission, withthe concurrence of the Assistant Attorney General, in accordance with 5U.S.C. 553, to require that the notification be in such form and containsuch information and documentary material as may be necessary and appropriateto determine whether the proposed transaction may, if consummated, violatethe antitrust laws. Subsection 7A(d)(2) of the act, 15 U.S.C. 18a(d)(2),grants the Commission, with the concurrence of the Assistant Attorney General,in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, the authority (A) to define the termsused in the act, (B) to exempt additional persons or transactions fromthe act's notification and waiting period requirements, and (C) to prescribesuch other rules as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposesof section 7A. On December 15, 1976, the Commission issued proposed rules and a proposedNotification and Report Form (``the Form'') to implement the act. Thisproposed rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 20, 1976, 41 FR 55488. Because ofthe volume of public comment, it became clear to the Commission that somesubstantial revisions would have to be made in the original rules. On July25, 1977, the Commission determined that additional public comment on therules would be desirable and approved revised proposed rules and a revisedproposed Notification and Report Form. The revised rules and Form werepublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 1, 1977, 42 FR 39040. Additional changesin the revised rules and Form were made after the close of the commentperiod. The Commission formally promulgated the final rules and Form, andissued an accompanying Statement of Basis and Purpose on July 10, 1978.The Assistant Attorney General gave his formal concurrence on July 18,1978. The final rules and Form and the Statement of Basis and Purpose werepublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 31, 1978, 43 FR 33451, and became effectiveon September 5, 1978. The rules are divided into three parts, which appear at 16 CFR Parts 801,802, and 803. Part 801 defines a number of the terms used in the act andrules, and explains which acquisitions are subject to the reporting andwaiting period requirements. Part 802 contains a number of exemptions fromthese requirements. Part 803 explains the procedures for complying withthe act. The Notification and Report Form, which is completed by personsrequired to file notification, is an appendix to Part 803 of the rules.Changes of a substantive nature have been made in the premerger notificationrules or Form on six occasions since they were first promulgated. The firstwas an increase in the minimum dollar value exemption contained in andSection;802.20of the rules. This amendment was proposed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 10, 1979, 44 FR 47099, and was publishedin final form in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 21, 1979, 44 FR 60781. The secondamendment replaced the requirement that certain revenue data for the year1972 be provided in the Notification and Report Form with a requirementthat comparable data be provided for the year 1977. This change was madebecause total revenues for the year 1977 broken down by Standard IndustrialClassification (SIC) codes became available from the Bureau of the Census.The amendment appeared in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 5, 1980, 45 FR 14205, and was effectiveMay 3, 1980. The third set of changes was published by the Federal Trade Commissionas proposed rule changes in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 29, 1981, 46 FR 38710. These revisionswere designed to clarify and improve the effectiveness of the rules andof the Notification and Report Form as well as to reduce the burden offiling notification. Several comments on the proposed changes were receivedduring the comment period. Final rules, which adopted some of the suggestionsreceived during the comment period, but which were substantially the sameas the proposed rules, were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 29, 1983, 48 FR 34427, and became effectiveon August 29, 1983. The fourth change, replacing the requirement to provide1977 revenue data with a requirement to provide 1982 data on the Form,was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 26, 1986, 51 FR 10368. The fifth set of changes to the rules and the Notification and Report Formwas published by the Federal Trade Commission as proposed rules changesin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 24, 1985, 50 FR 38742. Those thirteenproposed revisions were designed to reduce the cost to the public of complyingwith the rules and to improve the program's effectiveness. The Commissiondecided to adopt nine of the proposals, to reject one proposal and to deferaction on the other three. Final rules, which adopted some of the suggestionsreceived from public comments, were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 6, 1987, 52 FR 7066 and became effectiveon April 10, 1987. These changes included revisions to the Notificationand Report Form, found in 16 CFR 803 (Appendix). The Form had previouslyundergone minor revisions on two other occasions. The sixth set of amendments to the premerger notification rules grew outof the comments on Proposal 1 of the September 24, 1985, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, the proposed ``acquisition vehicle''rules. Upon reviewing the comments on the ``acquisition vehicle'' proposal,the Commission reconsidered its proposal and proposed a new approach thatapplies only to partnerships and other entities that do not have outstandingvoting securities. On March 6, 1987, the Commission proposed in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>52 FR 7095, amendments to its premerger notificationrules to implement this approach. The final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 29, 1987, 52 FR 20058, and became effectiveon July 4, 1987. The current set of proposals grew out of efforts by the Commission to insurecompliance with the antitrust premerger notification obligations. The Commissionhas investigated a number of transactions in which persons purchased votingsecurities without filing notification or waiting the requisite period.Few of these transactions raised any competitive issues. In addition, inalmost every case, acquiring stock without notifying the issuer and atthe lowest possible price, rather than escaping antitrust review, appearsto have been the reason for avoiding the premerger notification process.The Commission recognizes that premerger notification obligations can createdelay even for acquisitions that do not raise competitive concerns, andthat this delay can impose significant burdens on buyers and sellers. However,this interruption does not reflect a Congressional decision that the Commissionshould regulate generally the acquisition of voting securities or assets.It is, rather, the necessary consequence of preventing consummation whilethe antitrust agencies assess the likelihood that proposed transactionswill violate the antitrust laws. The special treatment of cash tender offersin section 7A(b)(1)(B) of the Act illustrates Congressional concern toavoid unnecessary disruption of the operation of the market for corporatecontrol. <T3>See </T3>122 Cong. Rec. H. 10,293 (daily ed. Sept. 16, 1976). In addition,the Commission has tried to minimize any unnecessary disruptive effectof premerger review by the design of its procedures and the speed withwhich it reviews proposed transactions. In addition, whenever the Commissioncan determine that a class of transactions is unlikely to violate the antitrustlaws, it has sought, with the concurrence of the Assistant Attorney Generalfor Antitrust, to exempt such transactions from all notification obligationsand the delay inherent in premerger review. Accordingly, the Commissionis exploring whether, consistent with its antitrust responsibilities, itcan modify its premerger notification rules so as to: (1) Substantiallyreduce the non-antitrust-related incentive to evade the obligations ofthe program; (2) eliminate any unnecessary burden on the parties; and (3)avoid any unneeded interference with the securities laws' disclosure requirementsand the market for corporate control. This Notice discusses in some detail the nature of the transactions inwhich the compliance problems have arisen, laws and regulations that affectthe non-antitrust related incentives not to comply with the Commission'srules, and the extent to which these and other purchases of minority interestshave competitive significance. It then offers one principal and two alternativemethods of modifying the rules that would diminish the avoidance incentiveand explains what the Commission believes are the advantages and disadvantagesof each. The Commission has undertaken the somewhat unusual step of presentingan extended discussion of the problem and proposing two alternatives inaddition to the principal proposal because this area involves numerousissues and each of the proposed solutions appears plausible. The Commission, therefore, invites interested persons to submit commentson the nature and scope of the problems described, on the desirabilityof each of the proposed amendments, and on other alternatives. <ITAG tagnum="85">Statement of Basis and Purpose for the Commission's Proposed Revisionof its Premerger Notification Rules </ITAG>The purpose of section 7A of the Clayton Act is clear: to give the antitrustagencies an opportunity to determine whether a proposed acquisition mightviolate the antitrust laws and an opportunity to challenge any such transactionprior to consummation. It is solely in order to meet this objective thatsection 7A requires advance notification to federal antitrust agenciesof proposed acquisitions. The Act was never intended to generate public disclosure of stock acquisitions.To the contrary, Section 7A(h) sets forth a rigorous confidentiality standard.Nonetheless, in order to assure that premerger notification and informationare received from the acquired person, in circumstances in which the acquiredperson might not otherwise be aware of its filing obligation (<T3>e.g., </T3>open market stock purchases), the antitrust premerger notificationrules require that the acquiring person disclose its holdings and intentionsto the acquired person at an early stage-before the $15 million reportingthreshold is crossed. (See 16 CFR 803.5.) The securities laws have as their purpose investor protection and the efficientfunctioning of capital markets. There has been vigorous and continuingdebate over the years as to when Congress should require public disclosureof stock acquisitions through the securities laws. The antitrust review procedures can require disclosure to the issuer whosestock is being acquired before any disclosure to a takeover ``target''can be very costly, both in terms of driving up the price of the stockand more generally by enabling the target to undertake defensive maneuvers.As a result, it appears that some purchasers have used various techniquesto avoid their antitrust notification obligation. Their aim has evidentlybeen to buy stock immediately and secretly and to delay notice to the issuerat least until public disclosure is required by securities laws. The Commission rejects the view that violation of the premerger notificationrequirements may be justified by the non-antitrust-related incentive toavoid disclosure to a takeover target or the public until required by thesecurities laws. The Commission will continue to require compliance withits rules. Nevertheless, it may be the case that certain aspects of theCommission's rules that require filing notifications create an incentiveto avoid that obligation, but do not play any significant role in the effectiveoperation of the premerger review. It may be possible, therefore, to broadenthe circumstances in which voting securities may be purchased without priornotification to the antitrust agencies or prior notice to the target. Inparticular, the Commission believes that the premerger notification rulesshould be amended if they can be changed in a way that would reduce complianceproblems and reduce filing burdens while maintaining the program as aneffective antitrust enforcement tool. If such changes can be made, a majorbenefit would be the freeing up of Commission resources currently expendedon compliance investigations regarding transactions that lack antitrustsignificance. This Notice seeks public comment on three alternative means of achievingthese ends. The principal proposal would exempt any acquisition of 10 percentor less of an issuer's voting securities, regardless of value. The Commission'sexperience, particularly its eight years experience reviewing premergernotifications, supports the conclusion that such acquisitions are unlikelyto violate the antitrust laws. This exemption would subsume the ``solelyfor the purpose of investment'' exemption in section 7A(c)(9) of the act(15 U.S.C. 18a(c)(9)), and, as a result, eliminate the need for the parallelprovision in andSection; 802.9 of the rules. The two alternatives proposeprocedures designed to address the apparently unlikely possibility thatan anticompetitive acquisition of 10 percent or less might occur. One procedurewould allow an acquiror to purchase up to 10 percent of an issuer's votingsecurities without reporting to the enforcement agencies, provided thatthe stock remains in escrow until the agencies have completed their antitrustreview. The other would enable a purchaser of up to 10 percent of the votingsecurities of an issuer to meet the premerger notification requirementswithout notifying the target firm. For certain non-consensual transaction,it would eliminate the reporting requirement currently imposed on the targetfirm if the acquiring person submits specified information not requiredby the existing notification and report form. I. The Compliance Problem Experience with the premerger notification program demonstrates a persistentproblem in obtaining full compliance with notification obligations foracquisitions of 10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securities. Asoutlined above, those compliance problems are largely, if not entirely,the result of non-anti-trust related economic incentives to avoid the notificationprocedures. In order to describe and assess these proposals more fully,it is important to understand the operation of the antitrust notificationprocedures and the securities laws, the point at which their requirementsresult in disclosures, and the types of transactions that are most affectedby these requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Hart-Scott-Rodino Requirements </ITAG>The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires thatcertain acquisitions be reported to the Commission and Department of Justiceprior to consummation. Assuming all other criteria are satisfied and notexemptions are applicable, an acquisition of voting securities or assetsmust be reported to the enforcement agencies and a waiting period mustbe observed before consummation if the transaction is valued at $15 millionor more, or if the transaction would result in the acquiring person holding50 percent or more of the voting securities of an issuer with sales orassets of $25 million or more. Section 7A(a)(3)(B) of the Clayton Act,15 U.S.C. 18a(a)(3)(B), and andSection; 802.20. The Commission's regulationseatablish three additional ``notification thresholds'' for acquisitionsof voting securities valued at more than $15 million.<T3> See</T3> andSection; 801.1(h). The next thresholds are 15 percent; 25percent; and, finally, 50 percent. The regulations impose a potential filingand waiting requirement for each threshold that will be crossed. However,subsequent filings can be avoided if the initial filing is for the highestthreshold the acquiror will meet.<T3> See, e.g.,</T3> andSection; 802.21 and examples. The waiting period prior to consummation of an acquisition is the Keystoneof the act. During this 30-day period (15 days in the case of a cash tenderoffer) the antitrust agencies can examine whether the proposed transactionis likely to violate the antitrust laws.<T3> See</T3> section 7A(b) of the act. They are authorized to requireadditional information from the parties and extend the waiting period upto another 20 days (10 in the case of cash tender offers) to review theadditional submission.<T3> See</T3> section 7A(e) of the act. Armed with the information developedwhile the waiting period preserves the status quo, the agencies can anddo challenge proposed mergers.<T3> See</T3> section 7A(f) of the act. They thereby avoid the complexremedial problems of undoing anticompetitive transactions. Typically, however, the waiting period is less than the statutory maximum.Few transactions need to be challenged, and only a small percentage receiverequests for additional information. For most transactions, the agenciescomplete their antitrust review within about two weeks and terminate thewaiting period in less than half of the maximum time allowed by statute.The filing obligation for a typical acquisition of voting securities containstwo notification obligations. The acquiring person must file the Notificationand Report Form with the antitrust agencies.<T3> See</T3> andSection; 803.2. It also must notify the issuer of the votingsecurities, if the shares are to be bought from a third party.<T3> See</T3> andSection;andSection; 801.30 and 803.5. The acquiror must servethis notice on the issuer prior to notifying the enforcement agencies.<T3> See</T3> andSection; 803.5.The prior notice of the target, therefore, is a precondition to the initiationof the waiting period for an acquisition of voting securities from a personother than the issuer. Pursuant to andSection; 801.30, the waiting periodbegins when the acquiring person files its notification. The acquired personmust file its notification within the 15 days (10 if the transaction isa cash tender offer) thereafter. Without notice from the acquiring person,the acquired person might not know that its voting securities were beingacquired, that it might have a filing obligation, or when it is requiredto file. Section 803.5(a), therefore, requires the acquiring person toinform the target firm of the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The identity of the acquiring person; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The fact that the acquiring person intends to acquire votingsecurities of the issuer;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The specific classes of voting securities of the issuer soughtto be acquired; and if known, the number of securities of each such classthat would be held by the acquiring person as a result of the acquisitionor, if the number is not known, the specific notification threshold thatthe acquiring person intends to meet or exceed; and, if designated by theacquiring person, a higher threshold for additional voting securities itmay hold in the year following the expiration of the wating period;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) The fact that the acquisition may be subject to the act, andthat the acquiring person will file notification under the act with theFederal Trade Commission and Assistant Attorney General;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) The anticipated date of receipt of such notification under andSection;803.10(c).</ITAG>One exception to these filing requirements should be noted. Congress declaredin section 7A(c)(9) that acquisitions of up to 10 percent of an issuer'svoting securities would not be subject to the Act's obligations if madesolely for the purpose of investment. The Commission has broadened thesolely-for-investment exemption and permits institutional investors toacquire up to 15 percent of an issuer's voting securities without filingnotification. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 802.64.  At this point in the discussion, then, the class of transactions of interestcomprises acquisitions of voting securities that are valued at more than$15 million and are not made solely for the purpose of investment. Theseproposed transactions must be reported regardless of the percentage acquired,unless another exemption is applicable. For acquisitions of the stock oflarge, publicly-traded firms relatively small acquisitions in terms ofpercentage acquired may therefore be reportable. If a firm's outstandingvoting securities are valued at $1 billion, a $15 million purchase wouldconstitute only 1.5 percent of the outstanding shares. It would require$50 million to acquire a 5 percent share or $150 million to acquire a 15percent share. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Securities Laws  </ITAG>The Williams Act, passed in 1968 as a series of amendments to the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, had as its primary objective the regulation of tenderoffers. Pub. L. 90-439, 82 Stat. 454 (1968). It requires acquiring personsto disclose publicly, at the time of making a tender offer, who the acquiringpersons are, where they will raise the money for the purchase, what theirplans for the company are, and whether they have special agreements withother shareholders of the target management. Acquirors are required tokeep the office open to all shareholders for a minimum of 20 business days.<T3>See </T3>section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.78m(d) and the rules thereunder. The Williams Act also requires any personwho acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent (reduced in 1970from the original 10 percent) of an issuer's voting securities to makea similar public disclosure within 10 days <T3>after </T3>acquiring more than 5 percent. <T3>See </T3>section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.78m(d). In some respects, Williams Act disclosures parallel antitrust premergerrequirements. The securities law disclosures concerning tender offers,like the antitrust premerger notifications, take place prior to the acquisitionof shares. Thus, the andSection; 803.5 notice given in connection with atender offer provides no new information to the target firm.  The requirement to disclose beneficial ownership under section 13(d), however,does not apply to purchases of 5 percent or less, and the required disclosuresfor larger purchases need not be made until after the 5 percent thresholdhas been crossed. Consequently, an acquiror may buy 5 percent without anydisclosure. The andSection; 803.5 notice to the target can thus reveal anacquiror's otherwise secret plans. These acquirors have an incentive notto comply with the premerger notification rules in order to purchase sharesmore cheaply in secret.  In addition, although the section 13(d) disclosure obligation is triggeredby the acquisition of more than a 5 percent interest, an acquiror may accumulatea substantially larger percentage of the target's shares before makingthe disclosures. For example, the acquiror conceivably might, through blockpurchases, obtain a majority or even all of the target's shares beforemaking its public disclosure. Moreover, section 13(d) permits the acquirorto continue buying shares during the 10 days it has to make the disclosures. The percentage of shares an acquiror is likely to purchase initially andduring this 10-day period is significant for determining whether the levelof purchases at which secrecy is maintained under the Williams Act canbe matched under the antitrust rules without compromising the effectivenessof the premerger review program as an antitrust enforcement tool. If purchaserstypically acquire enough voting securities to transfer working controlof target firms before they make their acquisitions public, the Commissionwould be unable to bring its rules into close harmony with section 13(d).The enforcement agencies must have information in advance from both theacquiring and the acquired firm to evaluate adequately the antitrust implicationsof a transfer of control. If, however, purchasers more typically limittheir non-public acquisitions to a lower percentage of voting securities_onethat is unlikely to allow them to influence the firm's management_it maybe possible to revise the premerger notification requirements to accommodatethe level at which Congress permitted secrecy under the securities laws.Analysis of a random sample of one hundred Schedule 13D disclosures ofbeneficial interest filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showsthat 59 of the acquirors held less than 10 percent of the target's securities.Of the remainder, it appears that none of the acquirors had an incentiveto violate their premerger notification obligations. Those acquisitionsexceeding 10 percent fell into several categories: exempt from premergernotification obligations (because the acquisitions were valued at $15 millionor less or were stock options); otherwise not reportable; made by the issuer'smanagers who had little reason to hide their transactions from the issuer;or made after filing the required antitrust notification. A conclusionthat acquisitions of more than 10 percent are less likely to be involvedin antitrust notification compliance problems would also be consistentwith the Commission's experience under the Hart-Scott-Rodino act describedin the following section.  There appear to be a least two reasons that holdings greater than 10 percentare often not amassed before filing a Schedule 13D, despite existence ofthe ``10 day window'' between the crossing of the 5 percent threshold andthe mandatory disclosure. First, it may be difficult or unduly expensiveto acquire such holdings during that time period. Second, section 16(b)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b), may discouragepurchases beyond the 10 percent level. Section 16(b) requires a personholding more than 10 percent of a company's shares to disgorge to the companyany profits that person makes on the sale of company shares held for lessthan six months. Thus, persons whose plans contemplate, as one possibility,selling shares within the six-month period may limit their acquisitionsto less than 10 percent. If, for example, there objective is to obtaincontrol, acquirors may prefer to seek additional shares through a tenderoffer that conditions acceptance of additional shares on having a specifiedpercentage of shares tendered. Then the acquiror can be sure of obtainingcontrol when it buys the tendered shares or, it the acquisition plan failsbecause too few shares are tendered, the acquiror risks loss only on the10 percent holding and can retain any gain if it sells those shares ata profit.  The ability of acquirors to amass holdings greater than 5 percent withoutdisclosure may be significantly reduced as a result of legislation introducedin Congress to alter the Williams Act requirements. One approach wouldnarrow the ``10 day window'' or close it entirely by forbidding purchasesbeyond 5 percent until disclosure had been made. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Tender Offer Reform Act of 1987, H.R. 2172, 100th Cong.,1st Sess. (1987). Another proposal would, in addition, lower the disclosurethreshold to 3 percent or less. Tender Offer Disclosure and Fairness Actof 1987, S 1323, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987). <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Experience under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act  </ITAG>The Commission's experience with the permerger notification program suggeststhat acquiring persons have in a number of instances sought, through variousdevices, to avoid filing premerger notifications. These acquirors appearto have done so not in order to escape or delay antitrust review but, ratherin order to acquire voting securities prior to informing the issuer. Acquirorshave tried at least two ways to argue under the Commission's rules thatpurchases of a small percentage of an issuer's voting securities were exempt:(1) They acquired shares directly and claimed the transaction was exemptunder andSection; 802.9, because the shares were acquired ``solely for thepurpose of investment;'' and (2) they acquired shares ``indirectly'' throughbrokers under what were described as option agreements, claiming an exemptionunder andSection; 802.31. In most of these instances the acquiring personheld less than 10 percent of the issuer's voting securities. Furthermore,in a number of these instances the acquirors had actually filed or declaredan intention of file the antitrust notifications for shares purchased subsequentto disclosing their beneficial ownership under the securities laws. Thisexperience and our assessment of the current stituation under the securitieslaws set forth above suggest that the secrecy-based incentive to avoidfiling premerger notifications is greatest for acquisitions of less than10 percent.  Accordingly, the Commission believes that most acquirors would submit additionalpurchases to an antitrust premerger review, if they could acquire up to10 percent without prior notice to the issuer. The question raised in thisNotice is whether the Commission can alter its premerger notification rulesin a way that will reduce this incentive while maintaining an effectiveantitrust enforcement mechanism. The answer to that question depends inlarge part on the antitrust significance of acquisitions of up to 10 percentof an issuer's voting securities. II. The Antitrust Significance of 10 Percent Acquisitions  The Commission has examined three sources of guidance in considering theantitrust implications of acquisitions of 10 percent or less: antitrustchase law, experience with antitrust premerger filings, and federal statutorypresumptions. All three indicate that acquisitions of up to 10 percentare less likely to violate the antitrust laws than acquisitions of greaterpercentages. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Antitrust Case Law </ITAG>Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits acquisitions where the effect ``maybe substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.''15 U.S.C. 18. It requires courts to predict whether a stock acquisitionmay give the acquiring person the power to influence target managementin an anticompetitive manner. <T3>United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., </T3>353 U.S. 586(1957). An acquiring person does not need to purchase as much as 50% of anothercompany's stock to violate section 7. <T3>See, e.g., Denver andamp; R.G.W.R.R. Co. v. United States, </T3>387 U.S.485 (1967); <T3>United States v. E.I. du Pont De Nemours and Co., supra. </T3>In <T3>Du Pont, </T3>the court stated that an acquisition of ``any part ofthe stock of another corporation, * * * is within reach of the Sectionwhenever the reasonable likelihood appears that the acquisition will resultin a restraint of commerce of in the creation of a monopoly * * *'' 353U.S. at 592. The court held that Du Pont's 23% share of General Motorssecurities violated section 7.Other antitrust cases have recognized the influence on a target's managementthat the holder of a 20 percent interest can exert. <T3>See, e.g., Crane v. Briggs, </T3>280 F.2d 747 (6th Cir 1960) (22% andthe power to elect two directors enjoined as a violation of section 7);<T3>Jacobson Manufacturing Co. v. Sterling Precision Corp., </T3>282 F.Supp 598 (E.D. Wisc. 1968) (a 22% owner ``is going to be in position toexercise some form of control''). Other courts have indicated that it wouldbe appropriate to enjoin an acquisition that would result in the acquirorholding 20 percent of a target's shares. <T3>See, e.g., Gulf and Western Industries, Inc. v. Great Aandamp;P Tea Co.,Inc. </T3>476 F.2d 687 (2d Cir. 1973) (19% share); <T3>Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., </T3>114 F. Supp 307 (D. Conn.),<T3>aff'd, </T3>206 F.2d 738 (2d Cir. 1953) (24% share). Acquisitions of under 10 percent have received a mixed appraisal in casesnot involving section 7. For example, in <T3>Dan River, Inc. v. Unitex, Ltd., </T3>624 F.2d 1216 (4th Cir. 1980),a securities law case, the court noted that 20 percent is ``frequentlyregarded as control of a corporation * * * [but] at this point in theirpurchase program when they have but some eight percent of Dan River's stock,they could not hope to exercise control.'' 624 F.2d at 1225. However, theCivil Aeronautics Board has declared that a carrier may be in a positionto exert control over another carrier at any percentage. <T3>See, e.g., Toolco-Northeast Control Case, </T3>42 C.A.B. 822, 825 (1965);<T3>Allegheny Airlines, </T3>41 C.A.B. 743, 744-5 (1964). With the agreementof incumbent management, an acquisition of only a few percent of sharessometimes has been the basis of a transfer of control to the acquiror.<T3>See generally Matter of Caplan v. Lionel Corp, </T3>14 N.Y.2d 679 (1964),<T3>aff'g, </T3>20 A.D.2d 301 (1964); <T3>cf. Essex Universal Corp v. Yates, </T3>305 F.2d 572 (2d Cir. 1962).There has apparently been no section 7 case that addressed directly andin detail the implications of an acquisition of less than 10 percent ofthe target's voting securities. There are two cases, however, that suggestthat acquisitions of less than 10 percent may violate section 7. In thefirst, a district court issued a preliminary injunction against an acquisitionof 9.9 percent of the target's shares. While this injunction was vacatedon appeal, <T3>Kennecott Copper Corp v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., </T3>584 F.2d 1195 (2dCir. 1978), the reversal appears to rest on the inadequate definitionsof product and geographic markets not on the ground that a 9.9 percentholding and the power to elect one director was insufficient to triggersection 7. In <T3>Vanadium Corp. of America v. Susquehanna Corp., </T3>203 F. Supp. 686(D. Del. 1962), the court enjoined Susquehanna, its president and relatedinterests from voting their combined 19.7 percent block of shares in Vanadiumon the grounds that the exercise of those voting rights would probablylessen competition in the vanadium market. It issued the injunction notwithstandingthat no person or entity in the Susquehanna group held as much as 10 percentof Vanadium's shares. Consequently, it appears that a court might alsoenjoin the acquisition of shares by individual members of a group evenwhere no individual's holdings would be sufficient alone to influence thetarget management. Finally, in one instance an acquisition of under 10 percent resulted inan interlocking directorate which the Commission found illegal under section8 of the Clayton Act. In <T3>Borg-Warner Corp. v. Federal Trade Commission, </T3>746 F.2d 108 (2dCir. 1984), Bosch GmbH had placed two of its directors on the board ofBorg-Warner after acquiring 9.5 percent of Borg-Warner's shares. The Commissionheld that the presence of common directors on both corporate boards violatedboth section 8 of the Clayton Act and section 5 of the Federal Trade CommissionAct, because the firms competed in three lines of business. The SecondCircuit reversed the Commission's order, but only on grounds of mootness(competition between the two firms had ceased as a result of divestingthe competing business line, and the firms no longer had common directors).These decisions indicate that although there are circumstances in whichthe acquisition of 10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securitiesmay violate the antitrust laws, the occurrence of actual anticompetitiveacquisitions in this range has been rare or non-existent. In addition,there are reasons why anticompetitive acquisitions of under 10 percentwould be unusual. Anticompetitive acquisitions appear to be of two principaltypes: acquisitions conferring control of an issuer, and acquisitions thatfacilitate collusion by obtaining the power to elect a member of the issuer'sboard of directors. Ten percent is not enough to guarantee control withoutthe agreement of the issuer's management; a person seeking control is thereforelikely to purchase more shares individually or set up a group to purchasethe requisite shares. The former would not be protected by an exemption(or other rules modification) that was limited to holdings of 10 percentor less. The latter would require a public disclosure under the securitieslaws and would risk liability under section 1 of the Sherman Act as wellas under section 7 of the Clayton Act. Obtaining a seat on the board ofdirectors might be an efficient way to facilitate collusion between theparties, but it too would normally be a public act likely to incite unwantedscrutiny by the antitrust agencies. Accordingly, it appears probable thatnearly all acquisitions of 10 percent or less will have no antitrust significance.The same reasoning applies even more forcefully to voting security acquisitionsof 5 percent or less. Obtaining control or a seat on the board is evenless likely, while all the risks of unwanted antitrust scrutiny from usinga group or obtaining the seat are the same. Moreover, even the sparse precedentfor finding antitrust violations for acquisitions of less than 10 percentevaporates for acquisitions of less than 5 percent of an issuer's votingsecurities. <T3>Kennecott, Vanadium, </T3>and <T3>Borg-Warner </T3>all involved acquirors of more than 5 percent. Weare aware of no case in which a tribunal at any level found a violationof section 7 for an acquisition of less than 5 percent, apart from acquisitionsby a person operating as a member of a group. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Antitrust Enforcement Activities </ITAG>Available records indicate neither of the antitrust agencies has ever challengedan acquisition of 10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securities asa violation of section 7. (In <T3>Borg-Warner, </T3>though, the Commission challenged under andSection;8 an interlocking directorate achieved through a 9.5 percent acquisition.)The complete absence of section 7 actions by federal enforcement agenciesis not surprising. Rather, it is consistent with the conclusion of thepreceding section that acquisitions of 10 percent or less do not appearto have presented competitive problems.This conclusion is further supported by an even more sensitive preliminaryindicator of antitrust enforcement interest. The Commission maintains recordsof two levels of preliminary enforcement interest on all transactions filedunder the premerger notification program: ``clearance,'' the first indicationof antitrust concern, initiates a procedure by which the two antitrustagencies decide which agency will begin an in-depth review of a transaction,and ``second requests,'' the procedure under the act for obtaining additionalinformation from the parties that generally indicates a higher level ofconcern. We have complete statistics for the years 1981-1984 (see tablebelow), and these demonstrate a much lower than average level of enforcementinterest in acquisitions of 10 percent or less. Overall, the percentageof clearances for these transactions was under 10 percent, which is lessthan two-thirds the percent in which clearances were sought for all transactions.The more recent but incomplete data for 1985 and 1986 show, for 1986, ahigher number of transactions reported and a higher percentage of clearances.The larger number of transactions involving acquisitions of up to 10 percentprobably reflects the larger number of transactions reported overall thatyear. The higher percentage of clearances may be just a chance variation.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Enforcement Interest in Selected Premerger Transactions</T4><H1>Calendar year</H1><H1>Transactions</H1><H1>Total clearances granted (FTC andamp; DOJ)</H1><H2>Number </H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Second requests issued (FTC andamp; DOJ)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Transactions as a percentage of annual total adjusted transactions</H1>A.

Thetwo second requests on the table involved special circumstances. Both transactionswere subject to second requests because the securities were being receivedin exchange for the independently reported acquisition of 100 percent ofthe acquiror's assets. In other words, the concern that generated the secondrequest was the merging of the two businesses, not the acquisition of asmall amount of voting securities by what would become a shell corporation.Had the acquisition of voting securities in these two instances been exemptfrom reporting obligations, the asset acquisitions would still have beenreported and the agencies' investigations, which included issuance of secondrequests, would not have been impeded. Apart from these transactions weknow of no second requests issued that were for acquisitions of 10 percentor less since the program was established in 1978.The small number of transactions reported in these categories and the lowdegree of enforcement interest should be interpreted with some caution.Because a premerger notification remains in effect for a year, acquirorsgenerally file for the highest threshold they expect to cross. Otherwise,an additional filing and waiting period would be required if a subsequentacquisition would increase the acquiror's holdings over the 15, 25, or50 percent thresholds. Thus, it is possible that a clearance or secondrequest recorded in these statistics at a higher threshold level mighthave been sought by the enforcement agencies if the percentage of votingsecurities intended to be held were 10 percent or less. There is, however,no indication of whether this is the case in any of these transactions.In addition, historical data on enforcement interest may not always beof great value in assessing whether a rules change would be likely to letanticompetitive transactions go unreported. If all acquisitions up to 10percent were exempt, more persons might be encouraged to make initial acquisitionswithin this range before making a filing, and it is possible that someof these acquisitions would raise competitive issues. Nonetheless, thecentral fact that we are unable to uncover any instance of either of theantitrust agencies ever challenging a stock acquisition of less than 10percent under section 7 alleviates this concern.The enforcement interest statistics, like the case law, indicate that therehas been relatively little antitrust interest in acquisitions of smallpercentages of an issuer's voting securities. The enforcement agencies'interest has been demonstrated only at the ``clearance'' level and evenat that level the interest has been must lower than for other transactions.There have been no relevant second requests. Moreover, neither antitrustagency has ever challenged an acquisition of 10 percent or less of an issuer'svoting securities as a violation of section 7.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Federal Statutory Presumptions</ITAG>There are a number of federal statutes that establish reporting and otherregulatory requirements based on the percentage of securities a personholds. They frequently reflect an implicit or explicit assumption thatbelow the stated percentage the acquiror is unlikely to control the issueror above that percent it is likely to control the issuer. While not determinativefor the premerger rules, the generalizations in those laws provide a usefulperspective. Federal regulatory statutes have generally used three percentages as benchmarks:5, 10, and 25. Most common is a presumption of control at a 25 percentholding: Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1841 <T3>et seq.</T3>; Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1811 <T3>et seq.</T3>; Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation Act, 12 U.S.C.1730(q)(8)(B); National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1730a (a)(2)(B); and theInvestment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-2 <T3>et seq.</T3> Another significant group of statutes use 10 percent eitherto presume control or the possibility of control or more simply as a notificationthreshold: Federal Aviation Act of 1953, 15 U.S.C. 1378(f); SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78p(a); and Public Utilities Holding CompanyAct of 1935, 15 U.S.C. 79(b)(a)(9) and (10). Still other statutes haveused a 5 percent holding as a notification threshold without any necessaryimplication of control: Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2);Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78m(d). Finally, severalacts have established a presumption that control does not exist for holdingsof less than 5 percent: Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, 12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(3);Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(1)(A).The legislative history of the securities laws, especially of section 13(d)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, includes extensive discussion ofwhether a holder of 5 percent or less is likely to control an issuer. Thepurpose of section 13(d) is to alert the marketplace to rapid accumulationsof securities which might represent a potential shift in control. <T3>Mosinee Paper Corp. v. Rondeau</T3>, 500 F.2d 1011 (7th Cir. 1974);<T3>GAF Corp. v. Milstein,</T3> 453 F.2d 709 (2d Cir. 1971). An acquisitionwhich reaches the 5% level signals ``the earliest possible moment of thepotential for a shift in control.'' <T3>Mosinee Paper,</T3> 500 F.2d at 1016.As noted earlier, section 13(d) was amended in 1970 to reduce from 10 percentto 5 percent the threshold level at which an acquisition of shares mustbe disclosed. The principal reason for the change was evidence presentedto Congress that companies limited their open market purchases to justbelow 10 percent as a means of avoiding the prior disclosure requirementapplicable to tender offers. Pub. L. 91-567, 84 Stat. 1497 (1970). Becauseof the ``ten day window,'' during which additional shares may be boughtprior to disclosure, the amendment may not have achieved its objective.However, the legislative history shows Senator Williams' concern that ``even5 percent, can involve large amounts of money and can have a significantimpact on corporate control.'' <T3>Hearings of S. 336 and S. 3431 Before the Subcommittee on Securitiesof the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, </T3>91st Cong., 2d Sess.1 (1970).On the other hand, the Chairman of the Federal Securities Acts Committeeof the Investment Bankers Association, who also spoke in favor of the amendmentto decrease the section 13(d) threshold, stated, ``We believe it has notbeen demonstrated that ownership of less than 10 percent of the equitysecurities of any company constitutes ``control'' of the company in anyway, even in the case of large corporations where the value of 9 percentof the equity securities would be many millions of dollars.'' <T3>Hearings, supra,</T3> at 115.If other federal statutes imply that holders of 10 percent or less of anissuer's voting securities are unlikely to control the issuer, the legislativehistory of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act tends more to the opposite view. Congresswas aware that the premerger notification program would require filingfor far smaller percentage acquisitions of voting securities than thosecovered by other statutes. Representative Hutchinson responded to a criticismthat the notification requirements of the act_$15 million or 15 percent_werenot strict enough: ``If the percentage test were the only test of substantiality,the cited statutes might provide appropriate guidance. But the [$15] millionfigure, in effect, operates to reduce the percentage required as the transactiongets larger. Thus, the two-pronged committee test is both more flexibleand more exact than the other statutory test.'' <T3>Id. </T3>Cong. Rec. H-8140 (daily ed. Aug. 2, 1976).When Congress considered a <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption for voting security acquisitions, it limitedthe exemption to acquisitions that (1) were ``solely for the purpose ofinvestment,'' and (2) constituted 10 percent or less of the outstandingvoting securities of the issuer. Section 7a(c)(9) of the act. The Commissioncould and did broaden this exemption using its authority under section7A(d)(2)(B) to exempt ``transactions which are not likely to violate theantitrust laws.'' Section 802.64 exempts an acquisition of up to 15 percentof an issuer's voting securities by an institutional investor if made solelyfor the purpose of investment. Neither this nor any of the other exemptionsin the rules are based on other federal statutory presumptions about controlof corporations.Overall, these other statutory presumptions support the proposition thatacquisitions of up to 10 percent are less likely to confer control or createcompetitive problems than acquisitions of greater percentages. Similarly,they indicate that any such problems are even less likely for holdingsof 5 percent or less. In contrast, the $15 million reporting thresholdin the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and the ``solely for the purpose of investment''qualification to its voting securities exemption indicate a Congressionalinterest in subjecting some types of acquisitions of 10 percent or lessto premerger review. At the same time, however, Congress gave the enforcementagencies broad authority in the act to exempt classes of transactions thatare unlikely to violate the antitrust laws. III. Proposed SolutionsThe proposals outlined below are directed at acquisitions of 10 percentor less of an issuer's outstanding voting securities. In part because theantitrust agencies appear never to have challenged such an acquisition,such acquisitions appear unlikely to violate the antitrust laws. As theforegoing discussion makes clear, the Commission has identified the 10percent level based also in part on marketplace incentives related to thesecurities laws. If the federal securities laws are amended, the Commissionmay want to focus on a different threshold level. At present, though, the10 percent level seems appropriate in light of both the securities lawsand antitrust enforcement interest.There are basically two approaches to reducing the conflict between theacquiror's desire to purchase small percentages of voting securities insecret, which is permitted by the securities laws, and the obligation tonotify the issuer contained in the premerger rules. The first is simplyto exempt small percentage acquisitions from all premerger obligations.The second is to alter the notification procedures in a way that removesthe obligation to notify the target but assures that the antitrust agenciesreceive the information they require and have an opportunity to reviewit before consumers are harmed or remedial options are lost or become unworkablycomplex.The principal proposal follows the first approach and would exempt allacquisitions of 10 percent or less of an issuer's outstanding voting securities.The alternative proposals follow the other approach and are designed toprevent competitive harm in those apparently unlikely instances when anacquisition of 10 percent or less would be anticompetitive. One would permitan acquiror to purchase 10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securitieswithout filing notification, provided the securities are held in escrowuntil the antitrust agencies have completed their review. The other wouldpermit an acquiror to file its prior notification for an acquisition of10 percent or less without notifying the issuer (who would not have a filingobligation), provided the acquiror supplies certain information about thetransaction and the issuer that is not now required. Under this proposal,the enforcement agencies would retain the authority to seek informationfrom the issuer if necessary.The Commission presents these alternatives with the recognition that thereare disadvantages, as well as advantages, to each of the proposals. Itrequests comments on the provisions of each proposal. It would also welcomesuggestions for other proposals as well as comments on the problems describedin this Notice and the proposals set out below. In addition, the Commissionwould appreciate comments on several specific issues. Those that relateto a particular proposal are stated after the discussion of that proposal.The following questions concern all the proposals.1. Is promulgation of any one of these proposals likely to change significantlyexisting patterns of acquiring voting securities? Would, for example, manymore persons make acquisitions of up to 10 percent of the voting securitiesof an issuer?The dearth of antitrust cases involving acquisitions of 10 percent or lesssuggests that it is unlikely that such acquisitions will raise competitiveproblems. It is possible, however, that some acquisitions of more than10 percent that were found to be anticompetitive would also have had significantanticompetitive effects if they had involved 10 percent or less. Specialtreatment of acquisitions of 10 percent or less could encourage some acquirorswho might not otherwise have done so to limit their initial or total purchasesto 10 percent. Under what circumstances might acquirors be so influenced,and in what situations would such small acquisitions be likely to violatethe antitrust laws?2. Under any of these proposals, will a substantial number of purchaserstypically seek to acquire more than 10 percent of the voting securitiesof an issuer before notifying the target? If so, is it likely that anyof these proposals will effectively reduce the Commission's burden of policingcompliance with the premerger rules?Analysis of the random sample of Schedule 13Ds filed with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission discussed earlier indicates that few acquirorswith an antitrust notification obligation exceed the 10 percent level withoutfirst previously satisfying their antitrust premerger notification obligations.The Commission's own experience also suggests that most, but not all, suchacquirors file with the SEC and this Commission before exceeding the 10percent level.Even for those who seek to acquire more, however, it appears that the incentiveto avoid the rules would be diminished if the Commission eliminated noticeto the target for a lower percentage than the acquiror had intended toaccumulate. For example, assume that for $15 million an acquiror couldpurchase one percent of the voting securities of an issuer. Assume furtherthat the acquiror expects to obtain a $1.5 million profit upon resale ofthe shares and that the expected costs and profits are proportional foracquisitions of 5 and 10 percent, provided the acquiror does not notifythe issuer prior to these acquisitions. Finally, assume that the acquirorcan buy 11 percent of the shares before the securities laws would requirea public disclosure. In deciding how much to buy under the current premergerrules, the acquiror must balance a no risk $1.5 million profit on 1 percentof the stock against a risky $16.5 million profit on 11 percent. (Thisprofit is risky because it can be achieved only by violating the rules,which may result in substantial civil penalties.) If, under any of theseproposals, the acquiror could buy 5 percent of the shares without notifyingthe target, the acquiror would face a different choice, balancing a $7.5million profit without any risk of violating the rules, against the riskier$16.5 million profit option. If the rules permitted the acquisition of10 percent without notice to the target, the choice would be between therisky $16.5 million profit and a legal profit of $15 million. In that casethe incentives appear to be very different.Are there other factors which would affect a purchaser's decision?3. If Congress amends the securities laws to eliminate the ``ten day window,''how should that change be reflected in these proposals?Under those circumstances, should all the proposals be restricted to votingsecurity acquisition of 5 percent or lower? Would applying any or all ofthese proposals to acquisitions of 5 percent (or percent), rather than10 percent, of an issuer's voting securities be a better approach evenwithout changes in the securities laws? In this regard, it should be notedthat all relevant transactions identified by the staff to date as beingpossible violations of the premerger notification requirements have involvedacquisitions of more than 5 percent. 4. Should the Commission revise the other voting securities thresholdsof andSection; 801.1(h) if it exempts acquisitions of 5 percent or 10 percentof the voting securities of an issuer? For example, if a 10 percent exemption were adopted, would it make senseto retain the 15 and 25 percent reporting thresholds? Would the programbe diminished or enhanced by replacing those with 10 and 20 percent thresholds?<ITAG tagnum="81">A. The Principal Proposal: An Unrestricted Exemption </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 802.24 would exempt from the obligations of the actthe accumulation by any persons of up to 10 percent of any issuer's votingsecurities. Acquirors would not have to suspend consummation of transactionsduring a waiting period nor would they be required to notify the antitrustagencies or the target of their acquisitions before or after consummation.This proposal appears to address most directly the non-antitrust-relatedincentive to avoid premerger notification obligations that acquirors faceprior to the point when andSection; 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 requires them to disclose their beneficial ownership. The Commissionwill also consider whether a lower percentage exemption, such as 5 percent,might be appropriate, particularly if the provisions of the securitieslaws are amended. Acquirors are reluctant to file premerger notifications because both thedelay imposed by the waiting period and informing the target could increasethe cost to them of acquiring the issuer's voting securities. In general,this class of persons would not acquire more than 10 percent of a target'svoting securities because of the strictures on short-swing profits imposedby section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and because ofthe difficulties of acquiring more shares at low prices in the ten-dayWilliams Act period. Where such persons do seek to acquire more than 10percent of the shares, the Commission expects that they would comply voluntarilywith the obligations of the premerger notification program. Unless thesecurities laws are changed, a 5 percent exemption would reduce but noteliminate this non-antitrust-related incentive to avoid premerger notificationrequirements for most persons. Currently, acquisitions of voting securities valued at more than $15 million,but which constitute 10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securities,are exempt under andSection; 802.9 if the shares are held ``solely for thepurpose of investment.'' That exemption is not now available if the securitiesare purchased ``with the intention of influencing the basic business decisionsof the issuer, or with the intention of participating in the managementof the issuer.''<T3> See</T3> letter of Bureau Director Thomas J. Campbell dated August19, 1982, included as Exhibit D in the Commission's Sixth Annual Reportto Congress on the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (July 26, 1983). This proposalwould subsume that exemption by eliminating the filing requirement forall acquisitions of 10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securities,regardless of the intent of the acquired person. In 1978 when the premerger rules were originally adopted, the Commissionrejected the suggestion ``that investment intent should be disregardedand that all acquisitions below the 10 percent level should be exempt.''43 FR 33490, July 31, 1978. The Commission's current consideration of anunrestricted 10 percent exemption is based on eight years experience reviewingpremerger notifications which supports the view that such acquisitionsare unlikely to violate the antitrust laws. It also responds to persistentproblems enforcing filing obligations for acquisitions of 10 percent orless, an continued suggestions for some type of unrestricted exemptionfor acquisitions of small percentages of voting securities. See Comment20 to the proposed ``acquisition vehicle'' rule 50 FR 38742, September24, 1985 and comment 4 to the proposed ``partnership control'' rule, 50FR 7095, March 6, 1987, promulgated 50 FR 20058, May 29, 1987. The Commission, with the concurrence of the Assistant Attorney General,is authorized to ``exempt, from the requirements of [the act], classesof * * * transactions which are not likely to violate the antitrust laws.''Section 7A(d)(2)(B) of the act. The finding required by the statute canbe demonstrated in different ways. The Commission can exempt a class oftransactions on the grounds that that type of transaction is inherentlyunlikely to be anticompetitive. For example, andSection; 802.30 and section7A(c)(3) exempt acquisitions of voting securities by persons who alreadyown 50 percent or more of an issuer. Given that such an acquiror alreadycontrols the issuer it is possible, but not likely, that as a result ofthe acquisition the issuer will act in a way that significantly diminishescompetition in any relevant market. The Commission relied in part on thisrationale when it adopted andSection; 802.35 which permits Employee StockOption Plans (ESOPs) to acquire shares in their employer's firm if theemployer controls the ESOP by a contractual right to appoint the plan'strustees. Exemptions can also be based on enforcement experience and statistics.In 1985 the Commission proposed to raise the andSection; 802.2(b) ``controlledissuer'' annual net sales and total assets thresholds. That proposal wasbased on the observation that few of the reportable ``controlled issuer''transactions have raised competitive problems, not that they could notdo so. The proposal rested on the grounds that many persons, whose transactionstypically raised no competitive problems, were unnecessarily burdened byreporting obligations because of the possibility that statistically unlikelyanticompetitive transactions might occur.It is not possible to say that voting securities acquisitions of 10 percentor less, or 5 percent or less, cannot violate the antitrust laws. The proposedexemption is rather based on the evidently low likelihood that ``the classof transactions'' will violate the antitrust laws. The statistics compiledby the Commission, discussed earlier, demonstrate a much lower level ofenforcement interest in acquisitions of 10 percent or less than in othertransactions. Our review of antitrust litigation and inability to findany section 7 cases filed by the agency with 10 percent or less ownershipprovides even stronger support for the exemption. The conclusion that theclass of transactions is unlikely to violate the antitrust laws is alsosupported both by the reasons that make it likely that persons who haveanticompetitive objectives would not acquire only small percentages andthe likelihood that the antitrust agencies would become aware of such anticompetitivetransactions even without premerger notifications. Of course, such anticompetitivetransactions occur, the proposed exemption would provide no basis for arguingthe legality of the transaction.The advantages of proposed andSection;802.24 are clear. The exemption directlyreduces the non-antitrust-related incentives to avoid filing. Its criteriaare objective_10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securities_and thereforeeasy to administer. The antitrust agencies would not have to devote theirresources to determining whether particular acquisitions were made solelyfor the purpose of investment.The disadvantages of proposed andSection;802.24 are also evident. The antitrustagencies would not have the benefit of prior notice, information aboutthe parties to a transaction, or the waiting period to prevent any anticompetitiveacquisitions of 10 percent or less of an issuer's voting securities. Inaddition, the Commission may continue to have a significant complianceproblem with persons who seek to acquire more than 10 percent of the votingsecurities of issuers without prior disclosure to the target companies.However, as discussed at some length above, it appears unlikely that anacquisition of 10 percent or less of the voting securities of an issuerwill violate the antitrust laws. And the Commission's experience has shownthat most reportable acquisitions without notice to the target have beenat or below the 10 percent level.The Commission has considered the foregoing but has not finally evaluatedthe merits of proposed andSection;802.24. Its further consideration wouldbe aided by comments on the following matters.1. When would the antitrust agencies likely learn of an acquisition of10 percent or less of the voting securities of an issuer if the acquisitionwere anticompetitive?The Commission could of course monitor Schedule 13D filings, but most ofthose are not transactions that would have antitrust notification obligationsand, in any case, do not contain adequate information to do a quick screening.2. Should the Commission consider some limitation on the 10 percent exemption?The Commission might, for example, specifically exclude transactions thatenable the acquiror to elect a director or that include an agreement toappoint one or more directors to the issuer's board.3. Should the Commission reconsider using the group concept from the securitieslaws if it exempts acquisitions of 5 percent or 10 percent of the votingsecurities of an issuer?One aspect of the antitrust interest in 5 percent holdings is raised bythe decision in <T3>Susquehanna</T3> discussed above that enjoins the exercise of rightsto 2 percent of the issuer's voting securities. That decision was premisedon the collective exercise of rights held by a ``group'' holding 19 percentof the shares. While such groups can act anticompetitively, the antitrustpremerger notification rules have not used the group concept, perhaps becausethe $15 million criterion effectively lowers the percentage threshold inlarge transactions. The Commission never used the securities law groupconcept in defining the acquiring person, and formally deleted the term``group'' from the definition of ``entity'' in a 1983 amendment to andSection;801.1(a)(2).48 FR 34428, July 29, 1983. It should be noted that if such a group formedan entity that was not controlled under andSection;801.1(b) and used thatentity to make an acquisition, the transaction probably would not be reportableif, pursuant to andSection;801.11(e) the entity did not itself meet the minimumsize-of-person test.4. Would a 5 percent exemption unduly complicate the rules by creatingfor acquisitions of voting securities a 5 percent unrestricted exemptionunder proposed andSection;802.24, on top of a 10 percent ``investment only''exemption under andSection;802.9, and the 15, 25 and 50 percent reportingthresholds of andSection;801.1(h)? <ITAG tagnum="81">B. The Escrow Proposal</ITAG>Proposed andSection;801.34 would permit acquirors to purchase, but not takepossession of, up to 10 percent of an issuer's voting securities withoutfiling a notification. The shares purchased would be placed in escrow andvoted by the escrow agent in proportion to the votes cast by all othershares. The acquiror would be required to file and observe the waitingperiod prior to purchasing more than 10 percent of an issuer's voting securitiesor prior to taking the shares out of escrow. Like the unrestricted exemption,this proposal directly addresses the source of the incentive not to fileantitrust premerger notifications. Both permit the purchase of shares withoutdelay or prior notification to the target. The acquiror can thereby obtainthe economic benefit of acquiring in secret. Thus, unless it would acquiremore than 10 percent prior to making its securities law disclosures, theacquiror has no confidentiality reasons to avoid its subsequent antitrustpremerger obligations. The excrow proposal, unlike the unrestricted exemption, would not necessarilyrequire a conclusion by the Commission that holdings of 10 percent or lessare unlikely to violate the antitrust laws. Rather the proposal could bebased in part on the judgement that in the relatively rare event such antitrustenforcement actions must be undertaken, the escrow arrangement normallywill be an effective guard against competitive harm and preserve the opportunityfor effective remedies. This procedure would not be available for acquisitionsthrough tender offers. Because tender offers are announced in advance,there is no interest served in delaying the antitrust review.The primary advantage of this proposal is that the antitrust agencies willlearn of an acquisition and have an opportunity to review it before thepurchaser can vote its shares. Its weakness is that this opportunity occursafter the shares have been separated from the prior holder(s).The Commission has considered whether it has the authority under the actto promulgate the proposed treatment of voting securities held in escrow.The question arises because this proposal creates a procedure under whichthe filing and waiting requirements of the act would be met before sharesare taken out of escrow but after they are purchased. In contrast, theact explicitly prescribes procedures which provide for the antitrust reviewto be completed before an acquisition takes place. The Commission has concludedthat its authority under the act to ``define terms,'' exempt certain ``categoriesof transactions,'' and prescribe other rules ``necessary and appropriateto carry out the purposes'' of the act (section 7A(d)(2) of the act, 15U.S.C. 18a(d)(2)) would enable it to establish the procedures prescribedin proposed andSection;801.34 as a solution to the problem described in thisNotice.The treatment of acquisitions under proposed andSection;801.34 parallelsthe treatment of tender offers under the Commission's rules. Section 801.33establishes what steps in the acquisition process may be undertaken ina tender offer prior to the end of the waiting period without violatingthe act: the offer may be made, the tender pool may be established andthe shares may be tendered, but the acquiror may not accept the sharesfor payment. Thus, andSection;801.33 establishes acceptance for payment asthe consummation of an acquisition. Similarly, proposed andSection;801.34would determine the steps in the acquisition process that may be undertakenprior to filing by defining when consummation of an acquisition occursfor certain escrow purchases.In one respect, though, the proposed treatment of these escrow purchasesdiffers from the treatment of tender offers. Proposed andSection;801.34 wouldpermit payment and complete termination of the previous shareholder's rightswithout antitrust review. In this respect it is more like the acquisitionof convertible voting securities. Under andSection;802.31 the acquisitionof unconverted securities, including the termination of the previous shareholder'srights, in exempt. Section andSection;801.32 requires a filing only whenthe shares are subsequently exchanged with the issuer for voting securities.The Commission has previously created other procedures to permit escrowpurchases before filing in limited circumstances. Section andSection;801.31allows persons who tender their shares in a non-cash tender offer to acceptin payment shares from the offeror, if those shares are placed in escrowduring the pendency of their waiting period. Also, the Premerger NotificationOffice staff has permitted cash tender offerors seeking control of an issuerto consummate acquisitions after the expiration of their waiting periodseven if the target held a reportable amount of another issuer's securities.The staff has allowed in appropriate transactions the reportable secondaryacquisition on the condition that the secondary target's shares be placedin escrow pending expiration of the waiting period for the secondary acquisition.It should be noted here, however, that the circumstances in which the Commissionhas permitted purchases in escrow have been very limited. The antitrustenforcement agencies have opposed escrow agreements and continue to believethat, in general, purchases in escrow or hold separate agreements do notadequately protect against interim competitive harm or ensure adequaterelief. <T3>See, e.g., FTC v. PPG Industries,</T3> 798 F. 2d 1500 (D.C. Cir. 1986)and <T3>Application of Texas Air Corporation,</T3> U.S. Department of Transportation,Order 86-3-48 (March 14, 1986). The use of the escrow procedures proposedhere may be justified because the small percentages of voting securitiesinvolved make it likely that there will be no competitive harm and thatdivestiture will be available as an effective remedy.Other agencies operating under similar statutes have also permitted purchasesto be made and kept in escrow before the agencies exercised their powerto examine the transactions. For example, one airline may not acquire controlof another until the proposed acquisition had been reviewed and approvedby the Civil Aeronautic Board and now the Department of Transportation.49 U.S.C. 1378(a)(5). Beneficial ownership of 10 percent or more of thevoting securities of an airline creates a rebuttable presumption of control.49 U.S.C. 1378(f). Nevertheless, the Department of Transportation aftera case by case review, permits the prior acquisition of stock and requiresonly that it be placed in a voting trust while the acquisiton is underreview.The fact that other agencies permit escrow purchases offers some supportfor the view that the Commission may be justified in establishing a similarprocedure. There are, however, significant differences in the proceduresthey use and the statutes they enforce. The CAB, for example, had extensiveregulatory authority over airlines when it developed the escrow policy.Different programmatic needs or legislative expectations may have differentimplications for the appropriateness of escrow procedures.The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and its legislative history unequivocally emphasizethe requirement and expectation of antitrust review prior to an acquisition.The focus on prior review reflects the Congressional commitment to creatinga program which would assure that transactions could be evaluated and,if necessary, prevented, before businesses become so intertwined as tomake it impossible to restore effective competiton. However, none of theexamples in the Congressional debate illustrating the need for prior reviewincluded an acquisition of a small percentage of voting securities. Andnone of the debates about establishing the $15 million/15 percent of votingsecurities reporting threshold mentioned problems of formulating antitrustremedies for such transactions. The Commission has drafted the proposedprocedures for escrow purchases in light of the clear Congressional concernspecifically to prevent the scrambling of businesses by assuring that theshares cannot be voted. And, because the proposal is limited to purchasesof 10 percent or less of the voting securities of an issuer, there wouldappear to be little problem in obtaining an effective divestiture if thatbecame necessary.In evaluating the merits of the escrow purchase proposal, the Commissionis considering_in addition to issues discussed above_the following propositionsand welcomes comment on them.1. Is there a significant possibility of competitive harm during the timethe stock would be placed in escrow given that acquirors will not be ableto acquire more than 10 percent of an issuer's voting securities?There is of course, the possibility of harm to the issuer from the factof purchase and the concern about more to come. Employees may leave, orcustomers or suppliers may alter their plans based on expectations of eventsfollowing release of the securities from escrow. These effects seem, however,to be of much the same character as those resulting from a tender offeror a definitive contract to buy shares, both of which can be made, underthe rules, prior to filing.2. Would the acquisition of a small percentage of shares, held in escrow,prevent an effective antitrust remedy?Because no intermingling of assets or businesses seems likely during theescrow period, any remedy for an antitrust violation would be the saleof the voting securities. In most instances to maintain or fully restorecompetition it ought not be necessary to return these shares to their formerowners, even if those owners were, de facto, in control of the business.The likelihood of the remaining instances in which the transaction wouldboth violate the antitrust laws and require resale to the former ownerseems small.The Commission is also considering as an alternative to a 10 percent escrowproposal, a 5 percent escrow proposal, for the reasons and in the circumstancesdescribed in the unrestricted exemption proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. The Optional Notification Proposal</ITAG>The optional notification proposal would establish a separate system forantitrust premerger notifications for certain transactions in which theacquiring person would hold 10 percent or less of the outstanding votingsecurities of an issuer. This optional system would require the acquirorto submit specified public documents describing the entity to be acquired,but would not require that the issuer be given notice of the intended acquisition.The optional form would thus be available only for the acquisition of 10percent or less of the voting securities of firms that file Schedule 10Kswith the Securities and Exchange Commission and have publicly availableannual reports. While the acquired person would not be required to filean initial notification, the antitrust agency reviewing the filing wouldremain authorized to seek information from the acquired person either informallyor through a formal request for additional information.The optional notification proposal would reduce the incentive to avoidfiling the antitrust premerger notification by eliminating the prior noticeto the issuer of the voting securities. Like the other two proposals, itsprovisions limit the special treatment to acquisitions of up to 10 percentof the voting securities of an issuer. Like the escrow proposal, but unlikethe unrestricted exemption proposal, the notification alternative doesnot rely necessarily on a finding by the Commission that acquisitions of10 percent or less of the voting securities of an issuer are unlikely toviolate the antitrust laws. Like the other proposals, it would be likelyto reduce the non-antitrust-related incentive to violate the Commission'srules.The primary strength of this proposal is that it provides prior noticeto the antitrust agencies of transactions. It maintains the full statutoryperiod to review and, in appropriate instances, challenge them before thereis any change in the status quo. The proposal has, however, several possibledrawbacks. The antitrust agencies may contact the target during the waitingperiod, so that acquirors seeking secrecy still may be reluctant to file.In addition, this proposal maintains the full waiting period, so that thosewho may be more concerned about the ability to buy the moment the priceis right, may still be inclined to avoid filing. Moreover, the proposalis likely to reduce the initial information available to the antitrustagencies because the target will not file a Notification and Report Form.The Optional Notification and Report Form attempts to mitigate this lastdisadvantage by significant revisions to the requirements of items 4 and7. The Optional Form would require the acquiror to submit certain informationand documents relating to the issuer. Items 4(d) and 4(e) would requirethat the acquiror provide copies of Schedule 10Ks and annual reports ofthe issuer. This will assure some independent verification of the characteristicsof the target firm. The instructions to the Optional Form would state thatif the issuer is not required to submit periodic reports to the Securitiesand Exchange Commission so that the documents listed in item 4(d) do notexist, then the acquiror cannot take advantage of the alternative procedureallowed by andSection;801.30(c) by submitting the Optional Form. The actualdocuments must be submitted; no incorporation by reference to previousfilings would be acceptable for either item 4(d) or 4(e). Item 4(c) wouldalso be expanded. It would require that the acquiror submit all informationit has developed about the target or used in consideration of the takeover,not merely the information prepared for officers or directors.In addition, the form would require the acquiror to develop informationabout the issuer. Item 7 would require the acquiring person to determinefor each product or service it offers, whether the target produces a competingproduct or service. The form details a series of minimum efforts that theacquiror must make to identify the target's businesses. For each competingproduct or service, the Optional Form requires the acquiror to identifythe geographic areas in which it or the issuer operates. If the acquirorconcludes that the acquiror and the issuer produce no competing productsor services, then Item 7 requires that the acquiror detail the search uponwhich it based that conclusion. An acquiror who does not conduct the necessarysearch or submit the required information for this item may not use theOptional Form.Item 6 would also be expanded to require the acquiror to submit additionalinformation about the issuer. Items 6(d), 6(e), and 6(f) would requirea description of entities included within the isuer, shareholders of theissuer, and holdings of the issuer, the same information the acquiror mustsubmit about itself in Items 6(a), 6(b), and 6(c).The Optional Form requires the acquiror to assemble or compile informationabout the issuer because the antitrust agencies will not have the benefitof a form from the issuer. This requirement could be burdensome in someinstances. In such instances the acquiror is free to use the existing proceduresunder andSection;801.30(b).The Optional Form and instructions would differ from the existing formand instructions in a number of other, less significant areas. Becausethe optional form could be used only for an acquisition of 10% or lessof the voting securities of an issuer, references to other types of transactionsand questions soliciting information with respect to other types of transactionswould be deleted. For example, questions regarding a cash tender offer,formation of a joint venture, or an acquisition of assets would be omitted.The question requiring identification of the threshold to be crossed asa result of the acquisition would also be deleted.Finally, reference in the instructions to the requirement that notice beserved on the target issuer regarding its probable filing obligation wouldalso be deleted; in andSection;801.30(c) transactions the target issuer wouldhave no filing obligation and the acquiror would not be required to notifythe target of the acquisition.  In addition to an Operational Notification and Report Form, this proposalwould require a series of amendments to the rules. The following is a briefoutline of the necessary changes:  <T3>Proposed Section 801.30(c).</T3> This provision would state that the30-day initial waiting period will commence after an acquiring person thatseeks to acquire 10 percent or less of the voting securities of an issuer,in a transaction other than a tender offer, files the Optional Notificationand Report Form. This provision together with andSection;803.5(c) would establish three centralelements of this procedure. First, this procedure is optional. Second,the acquiring person need not give notice to the issuer (andSection;803.5(c)).Third, the acquired person has no obligation to file a Notification andReport Form.  This proposal, like the escrow proposal, would not be applicable to acquisitionsmade through tender offers because securities laws require that such offersbe made openly with advance notice. As a result, with respect to such transactions,acquirors do not have an incentive to avoid filing premerger notificationsfor the purpose of making acquisitions without giving notice to the issuer. <T3>Proposed Section 802.25.</T3> This provision would exempt certain acquiredpersons from the obligation to file the Notification and Report Form. Itwould also make clear that the acquired person would not be exempt froma request for additional information.  Because section 7A(e)(1) authorizes the antitrust agencies to issue ``secondrequests'' to any person required to file a notification under section7A(a), a quick reading of the statute may suggest the Commission lacksthe authority to require additional information from persons it has exemptedfrom the initial notification obligation. A closer examination suggests,however, that the determinative factor under paragraph (e)(1) is whetherthe person was obliged to file a notification under section 7A(a) of theact, not whether the Commission in its discretion exempted that personfrom that obligation. <T3>Proposed Section 803.1.</T3> This provision would add reference tothe Notification and Report Form.  <T3>Proposed Section 803.2(b)(3).</T3> This provision would reflect thatthe acquired person has no obligation to file if the waiting period isinitiated by filing the Optional Form, and specify for what entities theacquiring person is to complete the Optional Form. <T3>Proposed Section 803.3(e).</T3> This provision would state that theacquiring person must provide the copies of certain SEC documents and annualreports describing the acquired entity and required by items 4 (d) and(e) on the Optional Form. In contrast, the more usual standard requiresonly the acquiring person to submit what it knows about the issuer. Becausethe Commission would intend to do an initial review without contractingthe issuer, it would insist that the acquiror supply at a minimum thisinformation. Of course, the antitrust agencies would be free to contactthe issuer for any information they may think relevant, but the expectationis that such instances would be rare. If the acquiror fails to includethis required information about the issuer, then the filing will be deemeddeficient and no waiting period will be initiated in accordance with andSection;803.10(c)(2).<T3>Proposed Section 803.5(c).</T3> This provision would require the acquirorto submit an affidavit that it intends to make an acquisition of 10 percentor less of the outstanding voting securities. Section 803.5 is designedin part to make sure that the antitrust agencies do not review hypotheticaltransactions.  <T3>Proposed Section 803.20.</T3> This provision would reflect the factthe second requests may be issued to acquired persons that have been exempted,pursuant to proposed andSection;802.25, from the obligation to file a notification. <T3>Proposed Part 803 Appendix.</T3> The amendment would add the OptionalNotification and Report Form.  In evaluating the merits of the optional notification proposal, the Commissionis considering the following propositions and welcomes comment on them. 1. It is likely that the optional notification system can significantlyreduce the incentive to avoid notification, given the delay inherent inprior review?  2. Can the antitrust agencies conduct their premerger review without contactingthe acquired person and other firms in the industry in most transactions?In this connection, it should be noted Canada recently adopted a premergernotification program that allows for a confidential filing solely fromthe acquiror. Their early experience suggests it is possible to conductsome reviews in secret. 3. Would the adoption of the optional notification system require the antitrustagencies to impose even more stringent rules protecting the confidentialityof the information or monitor the stock transactions of persons who haveaccess to information included on an Optional Form? The antitrust agencies have an unblemished record in maintaining the confidentialityof information submitted pursuant to the premerger notification program.Most confidential information associated with premerger filings is eithernot easily exploitable or, like a decision to seek an injunction, valuableonly for a very short time. The information contained in the Optional Form,however, is likely to come in well in advance of the typical price runup that precedes takeover announcements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>16 CFR Parts 801 and 802 Antitrust.16 CFR Part 803 Antitrust, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.IV.
