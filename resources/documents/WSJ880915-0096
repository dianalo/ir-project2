Ms. Kanarak, like most Israelis, isn't panicked by the thought of chemical warheads slamming into the neighborhood.    But with two-thirds of Israel's population concentrated on the Mediterranean coast, the country is vulnerable. Officials say they don't have an effective defense against missiles; a single chemical warhead, like one the Syrians are believed to be developing, could kill thousands of civilians.    Yet Israelis aren't donning gas masks and scurrying to the nearest shelter. One reason is a stoicism bred of constant conflict and war. Another is the belief that the Arab nations would be crazy to use chemical weapons and risk retaliation.    &quot;If the Arabs leave us alone, we're Dr. Jekyll. If they use chemical weapons, we become Mr. Hyde,&quot; says Yehezkel Dror, a Hebrew University professor and former adviser to Israel's Defense Ministry. &quot;There will be no self-shackling when poison gas appears. We will be demonic in our response.&quot;    Syria is believed to be producing nerve and mustard gas -- two chemicals Iraq is believed to have used on Iranians and Kurds beginning in 1983. Libya used gas during fighting in Chad. And Egypt, now at peace with Israel, dropped gas on Yemen in the 1960s and may have helped other Arab states develop chemical arms. While poison gas isn't new to the Middle East, the ability to lob it into Israeli cities is improving rapidly. Israeli defense officials were surprised by Iraqi missile strikes on Tehran this spring, meaning that Tel Aviv is also within range.    Taken together with Chinese sales of medium-range missiles to Saudi Arabia, a possible Sino-Syrian deal for short-range rockets, and Libyan efforts to join the missile club, &quot;the worst-case scenario becomes very grim,&quot; says Miriam Ziv, a disarmament specialist with Is rael's Foreign Min istry. &quot;If Arabs work together in a future war, we could have chemical war heads coming from three or four directions.&quot; Israelis also are worried by what they see as the world's laissez-faire attitude toward Iraqi use of chemicals, most notably against Kurdish civilians in Iraq. &quot;The shooting of two Palestinians {by Israeli police} gets more publicity than the gassing of 5,000 Kurds,&quot; says Col. Zeev Eytan, a leading military analyst. &quot;The danger is that chemical weapons become as conventional as planes and tanks.&quot;    Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin also has criticized the press for focusing more on the Palestinian uprising than on the use of chemical weapons by Iraq and Iran. &quot;There is no doubt in my mind,&quot; he told the National Press Club this summer, &quot;that some of the Arab leaders believe that they have got legitimization to use ground-to-ground missiles, to use chemical means, maybe combined together, against centers of population.&quot;    Israel's army has stepped up training for poison-gas attacks; troops now carry antidotes and gas masks that can be fitted with prescription lenses. Last November, Israeli students held their largest gas drills ever, performing mock first-aid as tape decks simulated battle sounds. And in May, the deputy defense minister went to Switzerland to consider mass purchases of gas masks.    To be sure, many military experts think the chemical-warfare threat is overrated. On the battlefield, they say, gas would be little more than a nuisance, due to Israeli preparedness and prevailing westerly winds. A Syrian gas attack could easily blow back in the enemy's face -- or into the faces of Palestinians. If there is a tactical danger, it is gas attacks on the depots where reservists gather for battle. Because reserves make up more than 75% of the Israeli army, &quot;mobilization is the Achilles heel of our whole military system,&quot; says a senior official.    As for civilian targets, most analysts believe that rational Arab leaders will recognize the consequences and refrain from using gas. &quot;Israel isn't Iran,&quot; says Aharon Levran, a brigadier general with the reserves and a senior researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies. &quot;We have reprisal measures and Arabs respect them.&quot;    Most analysts believe &quot;conventional&quot; reprisals, such as heavy air strikes, are a sufficient deterrent. When Syrian missiles hit civilians in 1973, Israel bombed Syria's staff headquarters and knocked out power plants. Syria fired no more missiles.    But Israel is believed able to produce nuclear and chemical weapons as well. Asked about this, Israelis respond coyly. &quot;It wouldn't surprise me to learn that a modern country such as ours can develop chemical agents,&quot; says Brig. Gen. Levran, who has served with military intelligence. &quot;But if it's true we have a nuclear potential, why should we underrate ourselves with something as messy as gas?&quot; Analysts also note that the 1925 Geneva Protocol forbids only the use of chemical weapons, not making and storing them.    Even with strong deterrents, chemicals have shifted the strategic balance in the Middle East. Traditionally, Israel's air force has struck with impunity behind enemy lines, as it did in destroying an Iraqi nuclear plant in 1981. Now, Israel must consider the risk of a retaliatory chemical strike, or the potential for unintended side effects. If, for instance, Israel hits a Syrian airfield where chemicals are stored, it could let loose poison gas and spark a non-conventional war.    Also, chemical warheads allow hostile parties that don't border Israel, such as Iraq and Libya, to play a major role in future conflicts. In earlier wars, Iraq sent men and materiel to the frontline states. Next time, it could launch a chemically armed missile instead. Nor will Israel's better-trained and motivated troops count for much once missile exchanges begin.    &quot;The overall impact is that we've lost much of our traditional edge,&quot; says a senior defense analyst, who adds that &quot;in the next war, every coffee house in Tel Aviv will be on the front line.&quot;    To stay a step ahead, Israel recently signed an agreement with the U.S. to jointly develop an anti-missile system, the Arrow, that could defend against incoming warheads. Israel also may be working on a medium-range missile of its own, the so-called Jericho. And there is increasing debate about pre-emptive strikes against countries such as Saudi Arabia that are upgrading their missiles. But officials concede that an effective defense could take a decade and cost millions of dollars.    Surprisingly, all this talk about chemical weapons hasn't caused widespread anxiety among ordinary Israelis. Israel's military always has developed tanks and bombers at the expense of sheltering civilians. Most Israelis support this, believing that the best defense is a strong offense.    Israelis also recognize the fallibility of any civilian defense. A 1951 law requires that all new buildings have bomb shelters. But over the years, many of the concrete bunkers have become storage rooms, darkrooms, or gyms -- or been completely neglected. &quot;I don't know where the shelter in my building is, or who has the key,&quot; says Denise Wells, a 26-year-old graphic artist in Jerusalem. &quot;My feeling is, if a gas attack happens, it happens.&quot;    The army has distributed gas masks on a trial basis, to test the feasibility of supplying each home with protective gear. It found that people used the masks while spray-painting cars, or tossed them in a corner. After six months, most of the masks were lost or useless. Officials now say there are enough masks for every citizen, stored in several hundred warehouses. &quot;Even in the best of circumstances,&quot; says Col. Eytan, &quot;it could take hours, even days, to distribute masks to everyone.&quot;    But underlying Israelis' acceptance of the chemical threat is the fact that it is hard to panic a nation that has endured five major wars in 40 years, and now the months-old Palestinian uprising.    &quot;Israelis have been traumatized so often that the threat of nerve gas isn't going to break them,&quot; says Hebrew University's Mr. Dror. &quot;Some people may lie awake at night. But most will think, 'Haven't I got enough to worry about already?' and fall right back to sleep.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
