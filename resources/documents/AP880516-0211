Bush, the Republican nominee-to-be, also lashed out on Monday atthe most recent story suggesting his staff was involved in an armsand drugs network involving the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, callingit the ``oldest tiredest reporting.''   He denounced the story in Newsweek that suggested his foreignpolicy aide Donald Gregg was the Washington contact for an armsoperation supplying the Contras with links to drug dealers.   ``This is old news,'' he said. ``It's not even news. ... You getbombarded by these insinuations and tired stories. ... I'd hate tothink it is politically motivated material that has been lookedat.''   ``It's just pure unadulterated _ I've go to watch my lanuage.''   Later, he told local reporters in Seattle: ``I think it'sslanderous, and it's all been looked into.''   Bush said he did not believe the report woulld hurt his campaign.   ``No, I am not hurt and it doesn't happen to be true,'' he said.``I've learned to defend yourself and not let somebody libel orslander you.''   On the subject of acid rain, Bush said specific goals to cutdown on the air pollution that contributes to it may well beneeded. Administration policy is to continue to study acid rain.   Aides had promoted the speech _ to the Greater Seattle Chamberof Commerce _ as a major statement on the environment, a key themeof Bush's campaign in the Pacific Northwest.   ``A Bush administration will enforce environmental lawsaggressively, putting the responsibility for the cleanup where itbelongs _ on those who caused the problem in the first place,'' hesaid.   An earlier text of the speech was handed out by his staff butthen was hurriedly retrieved with the explanation that the text wasnot a final one. Just before Bush started speaking, another textwas distributed with no word on possible changes.   Bush has been bringing up the subject of the environment both inspeeches and in actions on this weeklong campaign swing, which hasappeared to be aimed mostly at the general election in the fall. Hehas campaigned in Oregon in advance of the Tuesday primary there,and late Monday he headed to California, which has its primary onJune 7.   Washington has already held its precinct caucuses, and Bushsuffered his sole loss on Super Tuesday here.   On Monday, he toured a major forestry reserach lab and a lumbermill near Seattle.   As he has recently, Bush spoke favorably of Teddy Roosevelt,declaring, ``I am proud of the leadership shown by Republicans onprotecting the environment.''   But he moved away from President Reagan's policies on acid rainas he seemed to suggest he would change much about Reagan's muchcriticized environmental policies.   ``With regard to acid rain, we can't study the problem any more_ we've got to begin to take effective action,'' Bush said. ``Therehas to be a national commitment to continue to reduce the emissionsof sulfur and nitrogen oxides.''   Bush went on to say that he would pursue initiatives that havecome from the negotiations with Canada on acid rain, ``and if theydo not produce results, establish specific emission reduction goalsthat promise steady progress toward cleaner air.''   He endorsed the administration's $5 billion program to developnew technologies to cut emissions from coal and other sources ofacid rain.   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said the acid rain position isdifferent from Reagan's.   The vice president seemed to suggest he would clean house at theEnvironmental Protection Agency.   ``A new administration is a time for change, a time for renewal.I will put the very best people we can find to work on ourenvironmental agenda. I want to bring a lot of people to Washingtonwho don't know what they can't do,'' Bush said.   Bush also endorsed many of the recommendations of thePresident's Commission on Americans Outdoors, a study that has notbeen officially released by the Reagan White House.   However, Teeley said Bush has not agreed to the commission'scall for spending $1 billion in new federal money a year on outdoorfacilities and parks. Over the weekend, Bush had made statementssupporting the commission's work without including anyqualifications.   On another subject, asked about Democrat Michael Dukakis' chargethat the new jobs created under Reagan have been largely low-wageones, Bush said:   ``He's wrong. The jobs that have been created are for the mostpart good jobs. ... The charge that the new jobs are flippinghamburgers ... and doing someone else's laundry are wrong.''</TEXT></DOC>
