Depending onthe existing capability of the industrial enterprises, the scope of nationalparticipation can be increased by technology transfer on all technicalareas to be applied for the construction of NPPs. Such technology requiresas basis a nuclear program of the country determined and supported bythe government and the utilities. This program has to be defined as realisticas even possible adjoined to the future energy demand of the country.Furthermore the available capability, existing qualifications and equipmentof the national industry have to be considered. On the basis of thesefundamental requirements a tailormade technology transfer program hasto be elaborated in close cooperation with an experienced main contractorof the plant and his partners for such technology transfer and shouldbe established afterwards. This program has to consider not only thegoal to achieve finally the independent production of components andequipment for NPPs or the construction of complete power plant unitsitself, but also the economic benefit of such a program for the country.The costs of technology transfer and the necessary investment of thenational industry required for the manufacture of nuclear componentshave to be thoroughly investigated, based on the expected scope of productsto be manufactured for the nuclear power plants according to the nuclearprogram. Furthermore the application of the technology transferred forother components e.g. for conventional power stations, mineral-oil orchemical industrial plants has to be considered.
