In a separate noticepublished in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Agency issued final rules implementing theMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (MontrealProtocol). In the context of that rulemaking, four issues were raised andaction on them deferred pending additional public comment and review. In the Preamble to its final rule, EPA briefly described new scientificinformation related to global ozone trends and seasonal losses in Antarctica.This ANPRM explains in greater detail the nature of that information. EPA's final rule implements the Protocol through a system of allocatedproduction and consumption allowances. EPA adopted this approach because,on balance, it appeared to be the most effective means of limiting ozone-depletingsubstances consistent with the Montreal Protocol. However, as explainedin the preamble to the final rule, EPA is concerned about two unintendedadverse consequences that might result from implementation of the rule.By allocating allowances to the seven domestic producers of CFCs and halons,and by restricting future supply of these chemicals, EPA's regulation couldresult in sizable windfalls accruing to these producers. The existenceof these windfalls could create an economic incentive for producers todelay the introduction of chemical substitutes which could have adverseeconomic and potential environmental consequences. EPA is seeking commenton the appropriateness and structure of supplementing its allocated quotasystem with a regulatory fee to remove any unintended incentives. Alternatively,the Agency is also seeking comment on the desirability of shifting fromthe allocated quota system promulgated today to an auction system.While the theory behind the allocated quota system is that the marketplace,through price increases, will provide adequate incentive for firms to reducetheir use of the regulated chemicals, EPA is concerned that some industries,particularly those in which CFCs and halons are a small part of the priceof final goods, may be slow to respond to market-driven price increasesand may not shift away from these chemicals as soon as it becomes cost-effectiveto do so. The effect of any such delays would be to substantially increaseCFC and halon prices to all firms, to increase the total costs to societyof meeting the Protocol's control requirements, and to increase windfallsto producers. EPA is seeking comment on industry-specific control requirementsas a supplement to allocated quotas that, under certain circumstances,it might promulgate to ensure that needed reduction in the use of CFCsand halons are adopted as soon as these reductions are cost-effective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Written comments on the ANPRM must be submitted by November1, 1988, to the location listed below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Written comments should be sent to Docket A-88-27,Central Docket Section, South Conference Room 4.

Background</ITAG>The threat of depletion of the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)was first raised well over a decade ago by the scientific community (Molinaand Rowland, 1974). The initial theory suggested that because CFCs arerelatively inert, emissions of these chemicals would not break down inthe lower atmosphere, but would instead slowly migrate to the stratospherewhere they would then break apart releasing chlorine. Once freed in thestratosphere, the chlorine would catalytically destroy ozone. From a healthand environmental perspective, depletion of the earth's ozone layer wouldallow more harmful ultraviolet radiation to penetrate the atmosphere andstrike the earth's surface which would increase the incidence of certainskin cancers and cataracts, suppress the human immune system, damage cropsand aquatic organisms, accelerate weathering of certain plastics, and increaseformation of ground-level ozone (smog).In the fourteen years of research since the original theory was proposedconsiderable scientific evidence has supported the general concern thatincreased emissions of CFCs (and halons) would lead to ozone depletion.(See, for example, Atmospheric Ozone, 1985 (WMO, 1986)).In response to the growing scientific consensus, the United Nations EnvironmentProgram (UNEP) began negotiations in 1981 in an effort to develop a multilateralresponse to reducing the threat of ozone depletion. These negotiationsresulted in the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layerin March 1985 which provides a framework for international cooperationin research, monitoring, and information exchange. Further negotiationsresulted in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the OzoneLayer which was signed in September 1987 and which requires Parties toreduce their use of specified ozone-depleting chemicals. The terms of theMontreal Protocol are discussed in detail in an earlier <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (December 14, 1987; 52 FR 47489). EPA's final rule implementing the Montreal Protocol is published elsewherein today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The notice accompanying that rule summarizesthe scientific, economic, technical, and legal bases for the Agency's action.It also describes the allocated quota system employed by EPA to achievethe Protocol's control refinements. While EPA believes that its final action meets its obligations under Sec.157(b) 42 U.S.C. section 7457(b) of the Clean Air Act and the MontrealProtocol, several issues were raised during the rulemaking which EPA believesrequire additional review. Specifically, new scientific information became available in summary formduring the course of the rulemaking which, in part because of time constraints,could not be fully reviewed and therefore was not considered in the finalrule. This ANPRM provides the public with a summary of that information.EPA intends to notify the public of the availability of the full body ofthe Ozone Trends Panel Report (NASA, 1988) when it becomes available andwill at that time request comments on its implications for future action.Three other issues, which relate to unintended adverse consequences ofEPA's use of allocated quotas, were raised in the public comments on theproposal and warrant additional review. EPA is seeking comment whetherit should add a regulatory fee to supplement the allocated quota system.The fee would be designed to capture the windfalls which would otherwiseaccrue to a small number of CFC and halon producers. EPA is concerned thatthe existence of such windfalls would create a potential economic incentivefor these chemical producers to delay the introduction of chemical substitutes.Any such delay could have adverse economic and potential environmentalimpacts on EPA's stratospheric protection efforts. Alternatively, EPA isalso seeking comment on the desirability of shifting at some future dateto an auction-based system in place of allocated quotas. Finally, EPA is also seeking comment on the desirability of developingindustry-specific engineering controls and/or use-specific bans on CFCs.These rules are being considered as an adjunct to the allocated quota system,but would be promulgated only in instances where industries were not makingtimely progress toward reduced use of these chemicals. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. New Scientific Information </ITAG>A. Past Treatment As part of its December 14 proposal, EPA discussed the existing evidenceconcerning possible changes that have already occurred to the ozone layer(52 FR 47492). It essentially stated that, based on the major assessmentissued by the World Meteorological Organization in 1986 (WMO, 1986) andEPA's own risk assessment document (EPA, 1987), no statistically significantchange had occurred in global estimates of total column ozone (i.e., theamount of ozone from the earth's surface through the stratosphere in anygiven place). The preamble to the December proposal went on to discuss preliminary evidencerelated to areas of potentially critical concern: large seasonal lossesin ozone over Antarctica (the so-called Antarctic ozone hole) and preliminaryreports of global ozone reductions based on both ground-based and satellitemeasurements. While the existence of the ozone hole had been well documentedby researchers, key questions remained: was it caused by man-made chlorine;are there health and environmental effects from this regional phenomenon;and are there implications for global ozone levels? Data suggesting thatozone had depleted globally had not yet been published in the scientificliterature and therefore had not yet been thoroughly reviewed. In additionto validating and quantifying the trend itself, EPA also cited the needto distinguish ozone losses related to man-made chlorine from those relatedto natural causes (e.g., solar cycle, volcanic activity). EPA also raised the concern that current atmospheric models which wererelied on in the Agency's risk assessment do not account for these occurrences.In both cases, EPA stated that because of insufficient information andtime, it was premature to consider these issues in its assessment of risksor as part of the rulemaking. The Agency also referenced an assessmentof these issues (the Ozone Trends Panel) that was in progress at the time.B. Summary Report of the Ozone Trends Panel Following an 18-month review involving over 100 of the world's leadingatmospheric scientists, the executive summary of the Ozone Trends Panelreport was released on March 15, 1988. The Panel conducted an extensivereview of existing ground-based and satellite measurements and of the resultsfrom recent campaigns to Antarctica. They analyzed and sought to isolatechanges in ozone levels related to natural phenomenon from those relatedto chlorine and also compared ozone meausrements to predictions from atmosphericmodels.The executive summary contains a listing of key findings. The analysisshowed ``undisputed observational evidence'' of increased atmospheric levelsof trace gases (CFCs, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, halons)because of human activities. Its review of global ozone trends showed adepletion of 1.7 to 3.0 percent ozone loss between 1969 and 1986 at latitudesbetween 30 and 64 degrees in the northern hemisphere (where measurementsare the most extensive). This decrease occurs after correcting for theeffects of natural variation and is more pronounced in the winter thanthe summer. After comparing these measurements with model calculations,the report states that ``The observed changes may be due wholly, or inpart, to the increased atmospheric abundance of trace gases, primarilychlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).'' The Panel determined that ``it was not possibleto obtain a sufficiently accurate trend in total ozone using Nimbus-7 satellitedata alone because the rate of degradation of the diffuser plate cannotbe uniquely determined.'' This problem in interpreting the raw data fromthe satellite to correct for instrument error restricted the Panel's abilityto rely on this source of information for its conclusions. In its review of data related to Antarctic ozone, it reconfirmed that ``Therehas been a large, sudden, and unexpected decrease in the abundance of springtimeAntarctic ozone over the past decade.'' The 1987 data showed that the ozonehole had both deepened (i.e, greater loss of ozone) and had lasted longerthan previously recorded. It also reported apparent ozone decreases since1979 of 5 percent or more at all latitudes beyond 60 degrees south throughoutthe year. It concluded, ``The weight of evidence strongly indicates thatman-made chlorine species are primarily responsible for the observed decreasein ozone within the polar vortex.'' The executive summary of the report has been added to the public docketfor this rulemaking. As stated above, EPA will notify the public in a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice when the full report is completed andat that time will seek public comment. The Agency intends to use this informationin the coming months to update its own risk assessment and will also examineany additional scientific information (e.g. papers presented at the ozonetrends conference held in May 1988 in Snowmass, Colorado) that has recentlybecame available. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Combining a Regulatory Fee With Allocated Quotas </ITAG>In proposing to implement the Montreal Protocol (52 FR 47489; December14, 1987), EPA examined a range of alternative regulatory approaches includingthe use of traditional engineering control requirements and innovativemarket-based rules, and stated that ``[e]ach of the options has certainadvantages, but also raises possible problems'' (52 FR 47500). As explainedin the notice accompanying the final rule, after reviewing the public comments,EPA concluded that, on balance, the allocated quota approach is the appropriatemeans of implementing the Montreal Protocol. However, EPA also noted thatadditional regulatory steps may be required to minimize any unintendedadverse impacts resulting from this approach. One such impact is the potential for current CFC and halon producers toreap a windfall profit from the scarcity created by EPA's regulation. Inits December 14 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA asked ``whetherpossible profits from continued production of the restricted chemicalsmight have the undesired effect of delaying the introduction of less profitablechemical substitutes'' (52 FR 474507). The Agency also asked for commentson the option of combining allocated quotas with a regulatory fee. A. Basis for Adding a Fee to Allocated Quotas EPA received public comment on both the likelihood of sizable windfallsresulting from its allocated quota system and the potential implicationsfor delaying the introduction of chemical substitutes. The Agency alsoinitiated two studies (DeCanio, 1988 and Sobotka, 1988) examining theseissues. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Likelihood and Magnitude of Windfall </ITAG>In the December 14 NPRM, EPA explained why windfall profits (also termedtransfer revenues) could result from its proposed allocated quota system.Essentially, the allocated quota system operates by restricting the supplyof CFCs and halons. Since demand for these chemicals by user industriesis expected to continue to grow (because of continued demand for productswhich contain them or are made with them), competition for the restrictedCFC and halon supplies should result in firms paying higher prices forthese chemicals. While higher prices for CFCs and halons will stimulatesome firms and industries to shift to alternate materials, institute orincrease recycling, or produce other products, if substitutes are not readilyavailable, many firms will have little choice but to continue to use thesechemicals while paying a higher price. The RIA supporting the December 14 NPRM estimated windfall profits of between$2-6 billion through the end of the century depending on the rate at whichfirms employed low-cost control technologies (i.e. the faster controlsare employed the lower the windfalls). The amount of the predicted windfallis based on the market-clearing price paid for CFCs and halons. In turn,this price results from the allowable supply of CFCs and the market demandas determined, in part, by the costs of options available to firms andconsumers to reduce their use of these chemicals. EPA has revised its preliminary RIA to include new information on controltechnologies and market demand for these chemicals. Its revised estimatesuggests that windfalls could range from $1.8 to $7.2 billion through theturn of the century. (See chapter 9 of the RIA.) <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Potential for Delay of Substitutes </ITAG>As stated in the December 14 NPRM, EPA is concerned that the existenceof large windfalls could create an economic incentive for the CFC and halonproducers to delay the introduction of chemical substitutes. Chemical substitutesare likely to be more costly to produce and therefore less profitable thanCFCs and halons. In contrast, CFC and halon prices are likely to increasebecause of the supply restrictions set forth in EPA's regulation whichcould result in substantial windfall profits for CFC producers. As a result,EPA is concerned that the seven CFC and halon producers may use their marketpower to increase profits either by restricting the introduction of newchemicals by others or by delaying the introduction of the chemical substitutesthey now have under development. EPA is seeking public comment on whether markets conditions are likelyto create an environment where such actions are possible. Factors affectingfuture market conditions include: who conducts research and developmentfor new chemicals; who conducts research and development for user industryapplications; what is the likely cost of chemical substitutes; and whetherthe CFC/halon producers can deter competition from outside parties. Based on a review of patents on potential substitutes, it appears thatthe current producers of CFCs and halons are also the most likely producersof alternatives (Radian, 1987). For example, patents for HFC-134a and HCFC-123,two of the most likely substitutes, are held by several CFC producers inthe United States as well as by CFC producers in other countries. Moreover,a large share of the products applications testing for many industriesusing CFCs is done by the chemical producers. These companies provide awide range of services to their customers including detailed tests on theapplicability and use of new chemicals. Estimates of the costs of producing chemical substitutes generally rangefrom 2-4 times the costs of the currently available CFCs (Nelson, 1988).This large difference in the costs of production between the current CFCsand their substitutes suggests that CFC producers may have considerableflexibility in pricing CFCs to respond to efforts by non-producers to capturemarkets with more expensive chemical substitutes.Whether chemical producers will use this incentive to delay the introductionof chemical substitutes to increase windfall profits will depend on theextent to which they are willing and able to pursue a strategy of profitmaximization. One public interest group in their comments on the Decemberproposal contended that firms typically base decisions concerning the timingof new product introductions on such factors as the goal of maximizingprofits on existing products. The following discussion indicates that CFCproducers may have the <T3>ability </T3>to pursue such a goal; moreover, with the large potentialwindfall, it is clear that they will have an economic <T3>incentive </T3>to do so. In most market situations, the company first to introduce a new producthas the advantage. In this particular situation, however, 14 major chemicalfirms from throughout the world are working together as part of a privateconsortium in conducting joint toxicity tests. This joint effort offersmany important advantages. It spreads the multi-million dollar costs ofconducting these tests among many participants. It maximizes the use ofthe limited quantities of the new chemicals available for all purposes(toxicity tests and user application tests) in the near term. However,a public interest group in its comments raised the issue that this jointeffort effectively creates a potential mechanism for these firms to delayor slow down the introduction of new chemicals by influencing the paceand extent of toxicity testing. Thus, in the current market situation,the producers of CFCs are the owners of the most likely substitute technologies(e.g., through patents and proprietary process information) and could throughthe joint toxicity testing program and the high capital costs of production,be able to control the rate of diffusion and adoption of substitutes. Future increases in CFC prices will also provide an incentive for non-CFCproducers to develop and market substitutes. However, these firms willbe at a disadvantage for several reasons. As previously suggested, theygenerally lack the research, technical and marketing foundation to competeagainst current CFC producers. Moreover, current CFC producers could attemptto counter the introduction of substitutes by others by reducing the marketprice of CFCs (and thereby reduce but not eliminate their windfalls). EPA believes that a regulatory fee, by capturing the windfall profits,would remove the economic incentive for delay and thus at least partiallyaddress these concerns. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Impact of a Two-Year Delay </ITAG>The revised RIA supporting the final rule examines the potential impactof delaying by two years the introduction of chemical substitutes. Thisanalysis, as shown in Table 1, compares the impact of different schedulesfor the introduction of chemical substitutes on the costs and feasibilityof meeting the reductions called for in EPA's regulation. It illustratesseveral critical points. First, it shows that the effect of delaying themarketability of chemical substitutes is closely related to the rate atwhich firms act to adopt low-cost control options. Not surprisingly, theamount of pre-tax windfall, as well as the cost increases resulting fromthe delay of chemical substitutes, is substantially greater in Case 1 thanin the other two cases. Case 1 represents a scenario in which major userindustries (e.g., mobile air conditioning, solvent uses, hospital sterilization,refrigeration and certain foam uses) delay their adoption of technicallyavailable, low-cost reduction options. Table 1 shows that windfalls throughthe end of the century would <T3>increase </T3>by $10 billion through the end of the century under thisscenario if the introduction of substitutes were delayed by two years.The potential increase in windfalls for producers from a two-year delaywere estimated to be $1.3 billion in the Case 1A+B (where two industrysegments aggressively employ reduction technologies) and $100 million inCase 2 which represent a scenario where user industries adopt technologicallyfeasible, low-cost controls in a more timely manner. Table 1 also showsthat windfalls in the early years could be quite substantial (case 1) orcould be eliminated completely if low cost options are actively adopted(case 2).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Impacts of a Two-Year Delay in the Availability of Chemical Substitutes</T4>a<H1> </H1><H1>Case 1</H1>b<H2>Without delay</H2><H2>With delay</H2><H1>Case 1A+B </H1>c<H2>Without delay</H2><H2>With delay</H2><H1>Case 2 </H1>d<H2>Without delay</H2><H2>With delay</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Social Costs: e 1989-2000<D>2,730</D><D>4,252</D><D>2,122</D><D>2,215</D><D>1,012</D><D>1,033  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transfer Costs: f 1989-2000<D>7,282</D><D>17,390</D><D>4,983</D><D>6,329</D><D>1,886</D><D>1,985  </D></ITAG>CFC Price Increases: g  <ITAG tagnum="4">1989<D>6.69</D><D>6.69</D><D>1.95</D><D>1.95</D><D>0.00</D><D>0.00  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">1990<D>5.32</D><D>5.32</D><D>1.84</D><D>1.84</D><D>0.00</D><D>0.00  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">1991<D>1.84</D><D>5.88</D><D>1.59</D><D>1.85</D><D>0.00</D><D>0.00  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">1992<D>1.60</D><D>5.88</D><D>1.55</D><D>1.95</D><D>0.00</D><D>0.00  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">1993<D>3.93</D><D/>h 50.00<D>3.55</D><D>10.84</D><D>1.55</D><D>1.84  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">1995<D>5.48</D><D>5.00</D><D>3.55</D><D>3.77</D><D>1.59</D><D>1.59  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">1998<D>5.48</D><D>17.69</D><D>5.48</D><D>5.48</D><D>4.49</D><D>4.49  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">2000<D>5.48</D><D>5.48</D><D>5.48</D><D>5.48</D><D>3.77</D><D>4.35  </D><F/>a The assumed stringency and coverage assumptions used are thoseof the CFC 50%/Halon Freeze case described in Chapter 5 of the RIA. CFCsare regulated with an initial freeze in 1989 at 1986 levels, 20 percentreduction in 1993, and 50 percent reduction in 1998, and halons are frozenat 1986 levels in 1992. The assumed rate of growth in baseline use is theMiddle Growth Scenario described in Chapter 4 of the RIA. <F/>b Case 1 assumes that firms do not act expeditiously to employ cost-effectivecontrol options. For specific control options that are delayed, see Chapter9 of the RIA.  <F/>c Case 1A+B assumes that reductions from recycling of car air conditionersand shifts to allternative solvents are initiated in the initial yearsof the regulation, but that other sectors delay their adoption of cost-effectivereductions. See Chapter 9 of the RIA.  <F/>d Case 2 assumes control reductions are adopted across several keyindustries as explained in Chapter 9 of the RIA.  <F/>e Social costs discounted at a 2 percent discount rate and citedin millions of 1985 dollars. All windfalls are stated before taxes.  <F/>f Transfer payments discounted at a 6 percent discount rate andcited in millions of 1985 dollars.  <F/>g Price increases are for all CFC compounds and are stated in dollarsper kilogram are weighted by ozone depletion potential and are cited inconstant 1985 dollars. CFC prices are currently about $1 per kilogram. <F/>h CFC price increases are capped at $50.00 which indicates thatinsufficient controls or substitutes are contained within the model toachieve the required reduction.</ITAG></ITAG>  Table 1 also illustrates a second point. It shows that in Case 1, a twoyear delay renders it significantly more costly and difficult to meet the20 percent reduction stage in 1993. The $50.00 CFC price increase whichoccurs in that year is a ``backstop'' price indicating that, based on currentinformation, no alternative technologies are available to achieve the requiredreductions. In the absence of technologies or substitutes to reduce CFCuse to the required levels, the economic hardship and dislocations in meetingthe required reductions would be severe. The dealy in the availabilityof chemical substitutes would also make it more difficult to obtain greateror further CFC and halon reductions in the future, should new scientificinformation lead to a change in the Protocol's control requirements.  This analysis likely underestimates the additional costs associated withdelays in introducing chemical substitutes by ignoring potential savingsthat are likely as firms start ``learning by doing'' earlier rather thanlater (Decanio, 1988). This potential savings reflects the likely reductionsin cost over time that will occur as producers and users gain experiencewith the chemical substitutes.A regulatory fee could also indirectly aid in efforts to encourage developingnations to join the Protocol. One goal of the Protocol is to avoid expandedproduction of CFCs by these nations. To accomplish this end, the Protocolallows limited increases in production of controlled substances in developednations if they are exported to developing nations. Because of the technologicalease of CFC production, developing nations may choose to produce CFCs themselvesand not to join the Protocol if CFC substitutes are not readily available.Further, over the longer term, developing nations are more likely to participatein the protocol if they can themselves produce the chemical substitutesrequired for their domestic industries (e.g., refrigeration, electronics,etc.) which now use CFCs. Thus, the timing of the availability of chemicalsubstitutes will be one key factor in decisions by developing nations tojoin the Protocol. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Summary of Public Comments</ITAG>Seven commenters (auto companies, federal agency, public interest groups)stated that they opposed the use of allocated quotas alone because it wouldresult in a small number of producers reaping substantial windfalls andallow them to exercise substantial power over user industries through controlof CFC supplies. Some of these commenters also raised concerns about thepossibility of producers cutting production further than the regulationsrequire (to further increase prices) or delaying the introduction of chemicalsubstitutes. Ten commenters (public interest groups) stated that they supported theuse of a regulatory fee because if would provide an added incentive forfirms to reduce their consumption of CFCs and halons and would capturethe windfall profits that might otherwise encourage producers to delaythe development of chemical substitutes.In contrast, six commenters (chemical producers and industry trade association)argued that EPA had overestimated the magnitude of likely windfalls. Asstated earlier, EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) supporting the proposedregulation stated that, depending on the rate at which firms shifted awayfrom CFCs and halons, the magnitude of windfalls would range from justunder $2 billion to just under $6 billion (pre-tax dollars) over the remainderof this century. The commenters suggested that this estimate failed toconsider the higher costs associated with reduced CFC production, the increasein government tax receipts from any windfalls, and the need for capitalto fund development of chemical substitutes. Several commenters also statedthat because chemical producers are likely to allocate their allowableproduction to past customers and therefore are not likely to charge fullmarket price for CFCs and halons, windfalls would be lower than EPA's estimate.The Agency's reexamination of its analysis in light of the public commentshas reaffirmed its general conclusions on the magnitude of the potentialwindfalls. The Agency recognizes that fixed costs may increase slightlyas production is cut; however no evidence has been presented demonstratinglikely increases in variable costs which represent by far the largest percentof total production costs. As a result, production costs are not likelyto increase substantially in future years. While the RIA presents estimatesof transfers in pre-tax figures, EPA recognizes that to determine a firm'sactual windfall profits, the figures presented would have to be adjustedto reflect each firm's marginal tax rate. EPA's estimate of CFC price increasesand transfers were similar to those contained in an industry-sponsoredanalysis (performed by Putnam, Hayes and Bartlett for the Alliance forResponsible CFC Policy, 1987) of the impact of the proposed rule.EPA also questions the assertion by some chemical producers that they intendto moderate price increases and allocate their supplies to past customerswhich would have the effect of reducing windfalls. Although firms can pointto past situations of shortages where supplies have been rationed (insteadof sold at a market-clearing price), these situations typically involveonly minor and temporary shortfalls in supply. In the case of CFCs, shortagesare likely to increase over time and, unless regulations change, are permanent.The use of allocations by producers to their customers would substantiallyreduce the potential profits from these chemicals to the producers. Inaddition, if a secondary market developed, users for which current CFCsare less important or which can utilize existing substitutes or can recycle(``elastic'' users), would have an incentive to sell some of their allocationto users with little flexibility (``inelastic'' users) at higher pricesthan they paid for the CFCs. Thus, these ``elastic'' CFC users would capturemuch of the windfall for themselves. Mindful of this, there is a strongincentive for the producers to recoup the windfalls themselves rather thansee their customers the beneficiaries of these profits. Moreover, any allocationof these chemicals would likely result in substantial economic inefficienciesunless a secondary market quickly developed. If allocated CFCs or halons,user frims with relatively inexpensive reductions would have less of anincentive to make such reductions, while firms without such options wouldhave a more difficult time in purchasing CFCs or halons. The net effectof an allocation by producers would be a substantially greater cost tosociety to achieve any given reduction (Decanio, 1988). EPA also strongly disagrees with some commenters arguments that windfallsare necessary to fund the development of chemical substitutes. This argumentsuggests that price increases for the current CFCs should be used to subsidizespecific firms (i.e., the current CFC and halon producers) to develop alternatives.EPA believes that, at least in the medium and long-term, many firms besidesthe current CFC and halon producers are capable of developing substitutes,and that all such firms should have equal opportunity to bring substitutechemicals to the marketplace. Investment decisions concerning the developmentof new chemicals by existing CFC and halon producers should be based onmarket potential and not indirectly subsidized by EPA regulations. EPA's analysis contained in the RIA also suggests that the amount of thewindfall profits (e.g., several billion dollars) is far in excess of theresources now being spent by the chemical producers for research on chemicalsubstitutes. Morover, there would be no guarantee that producers wouldchannel their windfalls back into the development of alternative chemicals.Finally, given the substantial market for alternatives to CFCs, EPA doesnot agree that any such subsidy is necessary or warranted.Many industry commenters (primarily foam-blowers and halon users) opposedthe use of a fee system they believed it would increase the cost of theregulated chemicals and thus their costs of doing business, and would alsomake it difficult to compete against product substitutes particularly insome foam areas.EPA does not believe that a fee, used in conjunction with allocated quotas,would necessarily alter the price of CFCs and halons to user industries.As discussed above, the price of these chemicals is determined by supplyand demand. As a result, the price should increase over time because ofthe scarcity created by the limits on production contained in the allocatedquota regulation; consequently, all user firms will pay somewhat higherprices over time if they want to continue using these chemicals. By settingthe fee at or below the market price increase resulting from the reducedavailability of these chemicals (i.e., the price increase which resultsfrom the scarcity created by allocated quotas), no further increase inthe price of CFCs or halons should occur. The fee would, however, reduceor eliminate the amount of windfall profits to the producers and capturethat revenue for the United States Treasury, therefore eliminating anypotential economic incentive to delay the introduction of less profitablechemical substitutes. Some users appear to believe that producers will simply pass on the additionalcosts of the fee to the user industries, in effect charging them both theprice increase due to the scarcity created by the allocated quotas andthe added costs of the fee. If producers attempted to do so, the forcesof the marketplace would operate to reduce demand for CFCs and halons belowthe level of their allocation. Thus, producers would see the additionalprofits they would earn on CFCs sold at a higher price offset by the foregoneprofits from lost sales. However, under a fee system which captured theentire windfall (e.g., a fee based on the difference between observed marketprice and production costs) producers would never benefit from attemptingto pass the fee on to users. B. Design of Fee With Allocated Quota SystemTable 1 shows the amount of CFC price increases for different scenarios.These increases would effectively be the same as the rate at which a feewould be assessed if all the windfalls were captured and production costsremain unchanged. The table shows that the magnitude of the fee (or CFCprice increase) depends on the rate at which firms reduce their consumptionof CFCs. In fact, in Case 2, where firms in many sectors act quickly toreduce CFC consumption, no fee would be expected in the initial years ofthe regulation.The December 14 NPRM briefly described issues related to the design ofa regulatory fee. Design parameters mentioned included phasing-in the fee,basing the fee on the relative ozone depletion weights of the differentchemicals, and adjusting the fee over time (e.g., to reflect changes inmarket conditions, regulatory requirements, etc.).EPA received few comments on specific design issues. A chemical manufacturerand an auto company stated that, because of the limited detail containedin the December NPRM, any fee schedule would require additional publicnotice and comment including review at a public hearing. The chemical produceralso stated that the CFR and Halon price increases contained in EPA's RIAanalysis were sufficiently flawed that they should not be used as the basisfor setting a fee. EPA agrees with these comments; additional analyses,public review and comment are necessary before a regulatory fee can beadopted.Although EPA has concerns, discussed below, about whether it has the authorityand administrative capacity to design and administer a large fee program,the following sections discuss specific design issues related to implementinga regulatory fee program. The fee system should be narrowly circumscribedto further the regulatory purpose in section 157(b), (or TSCA Section 6,if TSCA is used as the authority for the fee). EPA believes that the followingmethods of setting a fee further the purpose of that section, but is seekingcomments on all issues related to its use of a regulatory fee.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Setting a Fee</ITAG>In evaluating options for setting a fee, EPA has considered a number ofissues, relating to the design and administration of the fee.(i) When does a windfall profit arise? Specifically, producers legitimatelyexpect a ``regular'' (non-windfall) profit_<T3>i.e., </T3>a reasonable rate of return. How should the Agency determinewhen profit margins exceed the reasonable rate of return as a result ofthe Protocol/EPA restrictions?(ii) How should the windfall profit be computed? In general, the windfallprofit is the difference between (a) market price and (b) costs plus reasonablerate of return. How should the Agency compute each element? For example,should EPA use actual current market price and actual costs, and actualrate of return during the pre-Protocol period (when no restrictions appliedand thus no windfall profit situation existed)? Or, should EPA use proxiesfor some or all of these elements?(iii) Should EPA's fee try to capture some or all of the windfall? Whatare the advantages and disadvantages of trying to capture the entire windfall?(iv) How would EPA administer the fee? For example, what collection procedureswould be necessary? What types of appeals could be expected between EPAand the industry, and by what administrative mechanism could those appealsbe resolved? Note that these administrative concerns may vary, dependingon how the fee is designed.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Options for Fee Design</ITAG><T3>a. Predetermined Escalating Fee Schedule. </T3>EPA could establishin its rule a set fee schedule which would escalate over time to reflectthe expected increasing market price of CFCs and halons (as demand forthese chemicals increases over time, but supply is reduced by EPA's regulation).In setting a fee schedule, EPA would also consider the expected costs andtiming of the intoduction of new chemical substitutes which would act asa ceiling on potential CFR and halon price increases.A predetermined fee schedule has the advantage of providing clear marketsignals for both producers and users. Depending on the level at which thefee was set, it also could remove much but probably not all of the potentialfor windfalls. It has the important disadvantage of being inflexible tonew technological developments that could significantly influence futuremarket conditions. Based on EPA's existing analysis of control costs and chemical substitutesas explained in the RIA, the regulatory fee could be set at approximately$.25 per kg in the initial stage of the program and increase in a linearmanner to approximate the currently anticipated costs of chemical substitutes(about $5.40/kg) in 1993 when they are expected to become available. <T3>b. Fees Based on Model Predictions. </T3>EPA would initially set thefee based on (i) predicted market price, determined directly from the analysiscontained in its RIA (which would be periodically updated); and (ii) estimatedproduction costs (plus a reasonable rate of return), determined by a calculatedbaseline production cost periodically modified to reflect inflation andchanges in the price of raw materials. For predicted market price, theAgency could use the average of its Case 1 and 2 scenarios (see Table 1)( which spans the likely response by industry) or it could develop a ``mostlikely scenario.'' For estimated production costs, EPA could determinethe production costs in a base year (e.g., a year before the Protocol cameinto effect) plus the profits earned that year. EPA could then index thesenumbers (costs plus profits) for inflation and changes in the price ofraw materials. The windfall would be the difference between the predictedmarket price and the estimated production costs. By estimating the market price <T3>increases </T3>in CFCs and halons, the RIA model theoretically predictsthe amount of the windfalls assuming no changes in production costs. However,given the complexity of the analysis, the control cost model used in theRIA could predict increases that are either too high or too low. EPA maywant to base the fee on some percentage of its estimated price increase(e.g., 90 or 95 percent) to avoid imposing a fee higher than the windfallthat would directly result from the forces of supply and demand. In addition,as new information becomes available, the analysis would have to be periodicallyupdated to reflect actual market responses. If the analysis contained in the current RIA were used to set the amountof the fee and the fee were based on 100 percent of the average of Case1 and 2 scenarios and assuming no changes in production costs, (i.e. noindexing of production costs plus a reasonable rate of return), the feeamounts would be the following: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7 </C>  <H1>Year </H1><H1>Projected CFC price increase \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1989 <D>$3.39 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1991 <D>0.92 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1993 <D>2.66 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1995 <D>2.68 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1999 <D>4.99 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2000 <D>4.62 </D><F>\1\Assumes no change in production costs and no increase in reasonablerate of return.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>c. Adjustable fees based actual market price. </T3>Under this approachEPA would base the fee on (i) actual market prices of CFCs and halons and(ii) either actual or estimated production costs (plus a reasonable rateof return). As in the last option, if production costs were esitmated,a base year prior to the Protocol restrictions would be selected. For example,if production costs were estimated using 1986 as the base year, the differencebetween the 1986 market price charged by CFC and halon producers for thecontrolled substances and the price charged in the marketplace for thesechemicals after the allocated quota system were implemented would be usedto determine the fee. Future market prices would be used in determiningthe amount of the fee. Future market prices would be used in determiningthe amount of the fee to ensure that the net prices (i.e., reflecting anyincreases in production costs) received by CFC producers were constant.Under this approach, future production cost increases could be calculatedbased on an inflation index and published prices for feedstocks chemicals.Instead of estimating changes in production costs, EPA could determineactual production costs, plus the reasonable rate of return in the baseyear, in order to calculate windfalls. Basing the amount of the fee on observed prices would relieve EPA of theburden of attempting to forecast price changes. This approach would alsolikely result in a fee that fluctuates, as market prices change to reflectthe introduction of new chemical substitutes. One likely outcome is a feethat is first higher and then lower. In the initial years of the phasedreduction of CFCs, the price of CFCs is likely to increase up to the pricelevel set by supply and demand as a result of the scarcity created by theallocated quotas. In the years following the introduction of chemical substitutes,the market price is likely to decrease as producers improve the efficiencyof making these chemical substitutes and as users make more efficient useof them. Thus, the amount of the fee would be contingent on the amountof the CFC increase in price; only as long as the marginal costs of thechemical substitutes exceed the marginal costs of the CFCs, a fee be charged.This indicates an automatic ``sunset'' provision in the fee structure;the fee is self-extinguishing as substitutes become cheaper to produceover time. This approach to setting a fee would effectively eliminate windfalls andthus remove any economic incentive producers may have to increase revenuesfrom sales of existing CFCs or halons by withholding the supply of chemicalsubstitutes. As a result, this approach effectively removes any economicincentive to delaying the introduction of chemical substitutes and thusis the approach most preferred by EPA. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Issues Related to Implementation of a Fee </ITAG>EPA is also seeking public comment on whether the fee should be assessedagainst production, or against consumption (defined in the Protocol asproduction plus imports minus exports) of controlled substances. A feeon production alone would entail charging domestic producers for CFCs produced(including those exported), and would not impose charges on CFCs imported.This would increase costs only to domestic producers and would result inimports having a competitive advantage over domestic production and UnitedStates exports facing a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign production.A fee assessed against consumption would amount to a charge on all CFCsproduced and imported, with an exemption or credit for CFCs exported. Allowingexports to be exempt from the fee would avoid burdening industry in theUnited States in its competition abroad without undermining the effectivenessof the fee program. A fee on consumption would be assessed against thelimited number of producers and importers and not involve the collectionof fees from the thousand of firms who use (but do not produce or import)controlled substances. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Uses of Revenue From a Fee </ITAG>The goal of any regulatory fee under section 157(b) of the Clean Air Actor under Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act would be to removethe incentive for delaying the introduction of chemical substitutes byreducing the size of windfall gains to producers. Under 31 U.S.C. 3302(b),any revenues generated from the assessment of a fee would go directly tothe United States Treasury. Because of this legal limitation, EPA is not considering a program to channelsome portion of the estimated potentially multi-billion dollars in windfallsback to those industries developing or employing reduction technologiesfor CFCs and halons. Any such program could only be authorized directlyby Congress. While allowing the CFC and halon producers to maintain thewindfall profits themselves would be clearly inequitable, making some portionof the windfalls available to any firm developing or using reduction technologiesmight be potentially attractive in aiding the transition away from CFCsand halons. Resources might also be made available to groups of firms orassociations working toward removing the institutional barriers (e.g.,codes and practices, purchasing specifications) to shifting away from CFCsand halons. EPA is seeking public comment on the desirability of providingfunding for the development of alternatives to CFCs and halons, how suchprogram might be structured, and what legislative action would be necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Auctions </ITAG>In it December 14 NPRM EPA also asked for comment on the use of auctionsas the mechanism for allocating production and consumption allowances.In that notice, EPA stated several advantages of auctions. Specifically,an auction system should result in reductions being achieved in an economicallyefficient manner and any revenues from the auction would to directly tothe United States Treasury. Auctions are attractive, in part, because they provide a direct mechanismto ensure that the available CFCs and halons are awarded to he highestvalue uses. Through the bidding process, individual firms must determinehow much they value the use of these chemicals. By awarding CFCs and halonsto the highest bidders, this system ensures that the limited supply ofthese chemicals are put to their most economical uses. A major advantageof an auction is that it automatically yields a price for production andconsumption allowances that reflects the expected windfall. Under an auctionsystem, each bidder has the incentive to bid as close as possible to theexpected value of the allowances. Firms that underbid at an auction couldobtain fewer allowances than desired; firms that overbid would either paya price greater than the value it placed on the allowances or would obtainmore allowances than desired. As discussed in the prior section in the context of adding a fee to allocatedquotas, auctions would avoid the problems associated with potential billiondollar windfalls which would accrue to a handful of CFC and halon producersunder allocated quotas alone. The revenue from higher CFC and halon priceswhich result from restricting supply of controlled substances as calledfor by the Montreal Protocol would instead be transferred to the Treasurythrough the auction system. Because of these potential advantages, EPA is seeking additional publiccomment on the possibility of shifting sometime in the future from theallocation scheme contained in its final rule to one in which productionand consumption allowances would be auctioned to any interested party.EPA intends to make such a determination within 90 days of the end of thepublic comment period. If the Agency pursued this option, it would issuea notice of proposed rulemaking seeking public comment on a specified deadlinefor shifting from allocated quotas to auctions and specific changes inits rule to allow for such a shift, and would then issue a final decisionon whether to provide for auctions. A. Public Comments on December NPRM A large number of industry commenters, including both CFC producers anduser firms, argued against the use of an auction on the basis that it wouldresult in greater market uncertainty, and encourage speculation and hoarding.CFC producers asserted that auctions would lead to: higher prices due tospeculation and hoarding; increased uncertainties concerning productionplanning by allowing any person to hold production allowances; and a disincentivefor the production of chemical substitutes by unnecessarily disruptinguser markets. Producers also commented that problems associated with auctionswere likely to be worse in the early years following implementation. With the exception to some firms within the automobile industry, CFC andhalon user industries also strongly opposed auctions. These firms wereprimarily concerned that firms would purchase more of these chemicals thanthey otherwise needed, thereby driving up prices. They were also concernedthat speculators would enter the market, further adding to market uncertainties.Commenters asserted that problems of an auction could harm small firmsdisproportionately. They argued that such firms could be ``shut-out'' oroutbid by large firms. In contrast, several commenters supported the use of auctions as economicallyefficient and as a means of avoiding large transfers to producers whichwould result from simply allocating quotas based on past activity. Onecommenter argued that speculators would help stabilize the market by buyingup allowances when prices were low and selling when prices are high. Thecommenter also stated that successful participation in an auction wouldbe based on the value of CFCs to a firm and not on the size of a firm.To the extent that these may be problems, such difficulties are likelyto be eliminated overtime through market transactions. Several commenters stated that EPA had not provided sufficient detail inits description of an auction to permit adequate review and comment andtherefore could not issue a final action without seeking additional publicinput. Several also questioned EPA's legal authority for implementing andauction. These legal issues are discussed below, in section V. EPA has reviewed the public's response on this issue, and is seeking additionalcomment on possible ways to structure an auction system which would addressthe problems raised by commenters. B. Structure of an Auction System 1.<T3> Participation rules</T3>. EPA believes that auctions should be opento all interested parties. Any limits on participation (e.g., only users,producers) would unnecessarily disrupt market forces. While the auction would be open to all interested parties, EPA does notbelieve that most of the tens of thousands of firms who use CFCs and halonsare likely to directly participate. These firms are more likely to continueusing their current channels of supply (e.g., wholesalers and chemicalproducers) and rely on these firms to ensure that requirements for productionand consumption allowances have been satisfied. Because of the limitedparticipation by small users, EPA does not believe that the administrativecosts associated with an auction would be excessive. 2.<T3> Defining the commodity</T3>. To implement the Montreal Protocol'slimits on both production and consumption, separate auctions could be heldfor consumption and production allowances. Firms interested only in importingcontrolled substances would likely bid only on consumption allowances.Producers of controlled substances would likely bid on both productionand consumption allowances. Producers could also rely on their customersto supply the consumption allowances also required for production underthe Montreal Protocol. All allowances would be transferable to provide firms maximum flexibilityto respond to changes in market conditions. The allowances could also befor a single control period or they could allow the same amount of productionor consumption for each of one or more periods (e.g., 100 units for eachof the control periods covering 1988 and 1989). To ensure that the UnitedStates complies with the terms of the Montreal Protocol (which requiresParties to stay within limits defined in terms of 12-month control periods),allowances could be defined for multiple control periods, as long as theydid not allow trade-offs between periods. Allowances of a shorter duration would also reduce concerns that allowanceholders, who are likely to include producers of CFCs and halons, mighthave an economic incentive to delay the introduction of chemical substitutesin order the maximize their market position. To be consistent with the Montreal Protocol, all allowances would be definedin terms of Group I (CFCs) and Group II (halon) controlled substances andseparate auctions would be held for each. 3.<T3> Frequency of auctions</T3>. The frequency of auctions could be animportant factor in minimizing concerns raised about the possibilitiesof uncertainty and hoarding. Frequent auctions would help establish a marketprice, which would reduce uncertainties concerning the price or controlledsubstances. They would also ensure that a supply of CFCs is continuouslymade available to the public and thereby avoid concerns about hoarding.4.<T3> Bidding system</T3>. To minimize administrative costs, the auctionitself would likely be held through the mail. Firms would base their bidson the value to them of using controlled substances, which would be determined,in part, by the costs of alternative controls and technologies. Sealedbids would also minimize any gaming (e.g., bids based on competitor's actions)which could occur through public bids. Firms could submit as many bidsas they want. 5.<T3> Basis for Awards</T3>. Awards would go to the highest bidders untilall of the allowances up for auction are distributed. Under different auctionsystems, the price charged to the winning bidders may vary. Under one systemall winning bids pay the amount contained in their bid. Under an alternativeapproach, each successful bid would pay an amount equal to the highestunsuccessful bid. C. Public Comment EPA is seeking public comment on the desirability of shifting from thepromulgated allocated quota system to a regulatory system based on auctions,and on ways to minimize any disruption associated with such a shift. Itis also seeking comment on the specific auction design features presentedabove.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Legal Issues Related to Fees and Auctions</ITAG>In the December 13 NPRM, EPA specifically sought comment on the legalityof adopting a regulatory fee or an auction (52 FR 47508). Numerous commenters(chemical producers and industry trade association) stated the EPA doesnot possess the authority to use a fee or an auction. They argued thatsuch a charge_a fee or an auction_would in effect constitute a tax andEPA does not possess the power to tax under the Clean Air Act or the ToxicSubstances Control Act. In contrast, two commenters (federal agency andpublic interest group) stated that EPA did have the authority to use feesor auctions.While EPA believes that CFC charges make good policy sense to eliminateany windfall that may arise, EPA recognizes that imposing CFC charges wouldbe a novel interpretation of the environmental statutes. This action wouldrepresent regulatory action by an administrative agency, pursuant to anasserted, but not explicit, grant of authority from Congress, to collectcharges. The sections below discuss the extent to which CFC charges wouldbe legally permissible.Two statutes that EPA administers provide possible legal authority: TheClean Air Act provides for the regulation of substances that may affectthe stratosphere. Section 157(b) of the Clean Air Act describes the regulatoryauthority:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he Administrator shall propose regulations for the control of anysubstance, practice, process, or activity or any combination thereof) whichis his judgement may reasonably be anticipated to affect the stratosphere,especially ozone in the stratosphere, if such effect in the stratospheremay reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Suchregulations shall take into account the feasibility and the costs of achievingsuch control.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA'') providesfor the regulation of toxic substances. Section 6(a) of TSCA provides that,after finding that a substance presents an unreasonable risk of injuryto health or the environment_<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he Administrator shall by rule apply one or more of the followingrequirements to such substance or mixture to the extent necessary to protectadequately against such risk using the least burdensome requirements .. . (5) A requirement prohibiting or otherwise regulating any manner ofmethod of commercial use of such substance or mixture.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A third possible source of authority is the Independent Offices AppropriationAct (``IOAA'') 31 U.S.C. 9701(a), which authorizes agencies to impose feeswhen granting benefits to outside parties.Conscious that it may be breaking new ground, EPA is soliciting commentson the legal rationale for administrative charges in this context. EPAsees two sets of legal issues: The first are Constitutional issues, including(i) whether the administrative charges are ``taxes'' (i.e., whether theasserted grant of congressional authority represents a delegation of theCongress' authority under the Constitution to impose taxes \1\<NOTE/>) or ``fees'' (i.e., whether the grant of authority representsa delegation of the authority to regulate commerce \2\<NOTE/>); and (ii) whether any delegation of authority from Congressto EPA to impose charges under the CAA or TSCA was sufficiently circumscribedto avoid delegation-of-legislative-power questions. The second set of issuesinvolve statutory interpretation, i.e., whether Congress in fact delegatedauthority to EPA under the CAA or the TSCA to impose these charges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ U.S. Constitution, Art., I Sec. 8, cl. 3.A. ConstitutionalIssues<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Summary of Case Law</ITAG>Three Supreme Court cases, and the series of appellate court cases thatfollow them, raise the Constitutional issues EPA is considering. In <T3>National Cable Television, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 415 U.S. 336 (1974) (``NCTA''), the Supreme Courtconstrued the IOAA, and held that under this statute an agency may notimpose a charge in excess of the value of agency services or other actionto the recipient because such a fee would be a ``tax.'' The Court defineda tax as a charge that has no necessary relationship to benefits received,may be based solely on ability to pay, and may be designed to serve publicpolicy by, e.g., discouraging certain activities or preventing ``entrepreneursfrom exploiting a semipublic cause for their own personal aggrandizement.''By comparison, according to the Court, a ``fee'' connotes some benefit,and is incident to a voluntary act such as a request for a permit.<T3> NCTA,</T3> at 341.In <T3>Head Money Cases (Edye</T3> v. <T3>Robertson)</T3>, 112 U.S. 423 (1884), and a series of appellate courtdecisions decided under it, the courts have upheld charges as being fees_andnot taxes_when the statute under which the charges were imposed was regulatoryand the charges were closely tied to the regulatory purpose of the statute.<T3>See, e.g., Brock </T3>v. <T3>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</T3>, 796 F.2d 481 (D.C.Cir. 1986), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>95 L.2d. 494, 107 S. Ct. 1887 (1987) and causescited therein. The tests cited in these cases are discussed more fullybelow.In <T3>Federal Energy Administration </T3>v. <T3>Algonquin SNG, Inc.,</T3> 426 U.S. 548 (1976) (``<T3>FEA</T3>''), the Supreme Court upheld a license fee imposed on importedgoods under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Court found that althoughthis Act did not by its terms explicitly authorize the imposition of suchlicense fees, it did include a grant of regulatory authority that was broadenough to encompass the charges. The Court further found that the legislativehistory of the Act contemplated license fees. Although not discussing anydistinction between taxes and fees, the Court found that the statute providedsufficient guidance for agency action to avoid any question of ``unconsitutionaldelegation of legislative power.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 558-62.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Application to CFC Charges</ITAG>EPA solicits comments on how to reconcile these various strands of thecase law, and the extent to which the CFC charges would be permissibleunder the case law. The following is a brief sketch of some of the importantissues.The case law, particularly <T3>NCTA</T3> and appellate cases decided under it, may be read to indicatethat the courts generally have been wary of upholding administrative charges,in particular charges that can be construed as representing ``taxes,''<T3>i.e.,</T3> of finding that Congress delegated to an agency the legislativeauthority under the Construction to impose taxes. See <T3>e.g., National Association of Broadcasters </T3>v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission, </T3>554 F.2d 1118, 1129 n.28 (D.C.Cir. 1975). <T3>But see </T3>Gillete andamp; Hopkins, <T3>Federal User Fees: A Legal and Economic Analysis,</T3> 67 B.U.L. Rev.793, 822-24 (1987).The argument that a CFC charge_either a fee or an auction_may be considereda ``tax'' under <T3>NCTA </T3>rests on the assertion that it is designed to serve publicpolicy by eliminating the incentive to delay introducing chemical substitutes.If so, a CFC charge may not be authorized. On the other hand, it may beargued that the CFC charge amounts to a fee that is authorized becauseit is paid in exchange for the privilege granted by the Federal governmentto continue production of CFCs.EPA is also soliciting comments on the extent to which the CFC chargesmeet the criteria in <T3>Head Money Cases</T3> and its progeny. In general, the administrativecharges upheld under these cases involved (i) explicit statutory authorizationfor the charges and (ii) a close connection between the charges and theregulatory purpose of the statute, <T3>e.g., </T3>in most of these cases, the funds were used by the agencyas part of the regulatory scheme. <T3>But see Rodgers </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> 138 F.2d 992 (6th Cir. 1943). By contrast, theCFC charges_either a fee or an auction_are not explicitly authorized bystatute and would not be used to fund the regulatory purpose of the statute.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Under 31 U.S.C. 3302(b), the funds collected through theCFC charges would go to the U.S. Treasury.However, arguments may be made that the CFC charges are regulatory feeswithin the spirt of <T3>Head Money Cases</T3> and its progeny. The charges are designed toremove the economic incentive to delay the introduction of chemical substitutesthat results from the sizable windfall profits that could accrue to thehandful of CFC and halon producers by EPA's allocated quota regulation.As described above, if chemical substitutes are delayed, it may prove costlyand difficult for industry to achieve the reductions required by the MontrealProtocol and by EPA's regulation. Moreover, any significant delay in theavailability of new chemicals would make it more difficult to achieve greateror faster reductions in CFCs and halons if future changes in reductionoccur. Seen in this light, according to this argument, the charges implementthe regulatory purpose of CAA section 157(b), which is to protect the stratosphere.If chemical substitutes are not made available in a timely manner, theoverall costs to society of meeting the regulatory goals would be increasedas more expensive controls are used in lieu of chemical substitutes. Asa result, it could be argued that the use of a charge as an adjunct tothe allocated quotas system may be consistent with the provisions of section157(b) that require the Agency to take into account the ``feasibility andcost of achieving such control.''For much the same reasons, it may be argued that the charges implementthe regulatory purposes of the TSCA. The legislative history of Section6 of TSCA reveals specific congressional concern that certain steps betaken to minimize the chance that regulatory action might generate monopolyprofits. <T3>See</T3> Conference Report on Toxic Substances Control Act, H. Rep.No. 94-1679, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 75 (1976). However, as discussed below,it is uncertain whether this legislative history can be read to contemplatefees or auctions.The case for CFC charges may also be strengthened by <T3>FEA,</T3> in which the Supreme Court upheld charges that were not explicitlyauthorized by statute in light of the broad scope of regulatory authoritythe statute granted. In that case, however, the Court further found thatthe legislative history of the statutory provision provides ``much to suggest''that license fees were authorized. As discussed below, the legislativehistory of the Clean Air Act and TSCA is not as clearly favorable for CFCcharges. Moreover, EPA is examining how to reconcile <T3>FEA</T3>_which did not raise the issue of whether the charges representeda delegation of the taxing power or the power to regulate commerce, andthus did not explicitly discuss whether the charges implement the regulatorypurpose of the statute_with <T3>Head Money Cases</T3> and its progeny, which do not undertake thatanalysis.EPA solicits comments on the extent to which the CAA or the TSCA, by itsterms, provides sufficient guidance for imposing charges_either fees orauctions_to avoid delegation-of-legislative-power questions, under <T3>FEA.</T3>B. Statutory Interpretation IssuesEPA is further examining the extent to which CFC charges fit within theintended scope of the regulatory authority Congress granted EPA under eitherCAA Sec. 157(b) or TSCA Sec. 6(a)(5). CAA Sec. 157(b), as quoted above,provides a grant of regulatory authority that is written broadly_``regulationsfor the control of any substance, practice, process, or activity * * *which * * * may reasonably be anticipated to affect the stratosphere ** *.'' Two commenters (public interest group, federal agency) argued thatthese terms are broad enough to permit the imposition of CFC charges.

Under this interpretationof the legislative history, Congress was primarily concerned about regulatingpollution solely through emission fees; <T3>i.e.,</T3> allowing sources to emit as much pollution as they werewilling to pay for. Under this interpretation, Congress was concerned thatthese types of emission fees (i) may not guarantee a particular level ofpollution control (because, for example, if the fees were set too low,sources would emit more pollution than anticipated), (ii) could be administrativelycomplex, and (iii) could have unforeseen economic effects on the industry.\5\<NOTE/> It could be argued that at least some of these concern maynot apply to CFC charges under either the fee system or the auction systemdescribed in this notice. For example, it could be argued that the CFCcharges described in this notice would not jeopardize attainment of a particularlevel of pollution control because the amount of CFCs that may be producedand consumed would be limited separately. That is, CFC fees would simplysupplement the allocated quota system. Similarly, an auction would simplybe a method of distributing the allowable amount of CFC production andconsumption rights.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For example, Senator Muskie, one of the architects ofthe 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments, raised these concerns during a September18, 1975 mark-up session held by the Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution,Committe on Public Works, concerning a proposal by Senator Buckley to imposean emission fee on emissions of sulfur dioxide.TSCA Sec. 6(a)(5) is also written broadly_``prohibiting or otherwise regulatingany manner or method of commercial use of such substance. . . .'' EPA solicitscomments on the extent to which these provisions may be broad enough bytheir terms to permit CFC charges. As discussed above, the legislativehistory of TSCA reveals specific congressional concern over monopoly profitsthat could result from EPA action to restrict supply of a substance. However,this legislative history seemed to result from earlier proposals to requireEPA to impose specific allocations of quotas, under certain circumstances,if EPA limited production or use of a product. This legislative historydoes not explicitly authorize action, such as fees, to eliminate monopolyprofits.One commenter (federal agency) argued that EPA also had authority underthe IOAA to impose CFC charges on the grounds that the IOAA authorizesfees in an amount up to the value of the benefit provided the recipient.This commenter stressed that in <T3>NCTA,</T3> the Supreme Court held that IOAA fees should be computedwith reference to ``value'' granted by the agency to the recipient, anddid not expressly limit the amount of fees to the agency costs in providingthe benefit. The commenter acknowledged that at least four Federal Courtsof Appeals, in at least eight decisions, following <T3>NCTA</T3> have stated that the IOAA limits fees to agency costs (orvalue provided the recipient, if lesser).\6\<NOTE/> However, the commenter indicated that these statements werenot relevant to the holdings of those cases. EPA invites further publiccomment on this issue, including on how clearly the appellate courts havespoken.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The commentator cited the following decisions: <T3>Central andamp; Southern Motor Freight Tariff Ass'n </T3>v.<T3> United States,</T3> 777 F.2d 722, 729 (D.C.

Cir. 1976).On a broader level, EPA seeks comments on whether interpreting the CAA,TSCA or the IOAA to permit EPA to charge CFC fees could result in interpretingthese and perhaps other statutes to permit EPA and other agencies to imposeother charges that could cumulate in substantial revenues. The potentialsignificance of administrative agencies' collecting substantial revenuesmay be a factor in interpreting the statutes to allow this action.C. Public CommentThe legal issues outlined above raise questions about the best way to proceedwith the proposal for CFC charges. CFC charges will be more effective ifimposed in the near future because even one or two years of windfall profitsaccruing to the current CFC producers could delay the introduction of substitutes,with detrimental results. If EPA imposed a fee in conjunction with allocatedquotas, United States compliance with the Montreal Protocol would not bein jeopardy even if the regulatory fee were legally challenged. However,if EPA were to impose fees, a court were to invalide them, and Congresswere then to impose them, the loss of time before the fees became effectivecould reduce their utility. Accordingly, EPA seeks comment on the overallextent of the legal risks noted above with respect to CFC fees, and thebest course to follow in light of the risks.Similarly, if a court invalidates the auction, the United States' compliancewith the Montreal Protocol would be jeopardized. Thus, EPA seeks commenton the overall extent of the legal risks concerning an auction, and thebest course to follow in light of the risks.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Direct Controls on Use of CFC and Halons</ITAG>In the December 14 proposed rule, the Agency described the possible needto develop a program of engineering controls or bans on CFC and halons,either alone or as a supplement to the allocated quotas, if users of thesechemicals were postponing the adoption of technologically available, low-costreductions. The central purpose of direct controls is to ensure that low-costreductions would be made in a timely manner, thus preventing unwarrantedprice increases for the uncontrolled substances.EPA received 48 comments addressing the issue of direct controls. Thirtycommenters opposed the adoption of any technology-based controls or bans.Generally, these comments cited as the major disadvantages of direct controls,the elimination of incentives to develop substitutes and innovative practices,the likelihood of high administrative and compliance costs, the uncertainlevel of environmental protection, and economic inefficiency as a resultof inflexibility and unresponsiveness to changing technological innovationsand economic conditions.In contrast, eighteen commenters favored engineering controls and bansfor some CFC and halon applications, because they believe that despiteCFC price increases, voluntary and timely reductions by industry are unlikelyin the near term. Seven commenters preferred that industry-specific engineeringcontrols or bans be imposed in conjunction with allocated quotas. One commenterbelieved that such a ``hybrid'' would protect foam-blowing applications,an end use where near-term substitutes may not be readily available, fromhaving to bear excesssive CFC price increases.For many of the reasons outlined in these comments, EPA did not promulgatedirect controls in the final rule published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. However, the Agency believes that direct controls,when used in conjunction with the allocated quota system, under certainconditions (e.g., to overcome market imperfections) offer a potential cost-savingto allocated quotas.While the allocated quota system, by itself, requires that the Protocol'smandated reductions in CFCs and halons occur and thus fully implementsthe requirements of the Montreal Protocol, the addition of a program ofdirect controls would ensure that low-cost reductions are adopted.Potential disadvantages of direct regulations, such as high complianceand administrative costs, depend on the type of controls adopted. For example,a ban of CFCs in some end use applications would be simple to administerand enforce. EPA also believes that innovative technologies would developif prospective bans were imposed in conjunction with allocated quotas andthat it is possible to design such regulations for select user groups thatwould minimize the disadvantages of this traditional regulatory approach.Several other nations (e.g., Canada, Japan, and Sweden) are consideringthis form of hybrid approach for their implementation of the Montreal Protocol.A. Need for Direct ControlsAs part of its revised RIA, EPA examined the potential impact of delayedefforts by user industries to adopt low-cost reduction technologies ina timely manner. This analysis compared two scenarios. The Case 1 scenarioassumed key user industries delayed the date at which they began shiftingaway from CFCs and that a lower percentage of firms in a user industrymade the shift over a longer period of time. The Case 2 scenario assumesexactly the opposite; firms aggressively move away from CFCs to alternativetechnologies and increased recycling and recovery. Tables 2 and 3 showthe user industries examined in this analysis and the assumptions usedin the Case 1 and 2 scenarios, respectively. These assumptions were enteredinto the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) used in the RIA. This modeldetermines likely CFC price effects based on assumptions concerning controloptions and actions by industries.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Case </T4>1 <T4>Assumptions About Technical Feasibility of CFC-Conserving Technologies</T4><H1>Sector/technology</H1><H1>Start date </H1>a<H1>Penetration time </H1>b<H1>Use-specific reduction potential in 1988 </H1>cMobile Air Conditioning:<ITAG tagnum="2">Recovery at Service-Large Shops<D>1989</D><D>3</D><D>6.5%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Recovery at Service-Medium Shops<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Recovery at Service-Small Shops<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">DME<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)</ITAG>Solvents:<ITAG tagnum="2">Terpenes and Aqueous Cleaning<D>1988</D><D>5</D><D>24%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">CFC-113 Azeotropes<D>1989</D><D>4</D><D/>e 7%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Housekeeping<D>1989</D><D>1</D><D/>f 5-12%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-123<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)</ITAG>Hospital Sterilization:<ITAG tagnum="2">Disposables<D>1988</D><D>9</D><D>22%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Alternate Blends<D>1988</D><D>5</D><D>7%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Contracting Out<D>1988</D><D>9</D><D>4%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Steam Cleaning<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)<D>(</D>d)</ITAG>Refrigeration:<ITAG tagnum="2">Recovery at Service<D>1988</D><D>5</D><D>3-11%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Recovery at Rework<D>1988</D><D>3</D><D>2%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">FC-134a<D>1992</D><D/>f 10-21<D/>f 5-53%</ITAG>Foam Insulation:<ITAG tagnum="2">Product Substitutes<D>1990</D><D/>f 5-10<D/>f 20-40%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-123<D>1992</D><D>3</D><D/>f 27-50%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-141b<D>1991</D><D>3</D><D/>f 30-50%</ITAG>Flexible Foam-Molded:<ITAG tagnum="2">Water-Blown Processes<D>1988</D><D>3</D><D>41%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-141b<D>1991</D><D>9</D><D>18%</D></ITAG>Flexible Foam-Slabstock:<ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-123<D>1992</D><D>9</D><D>26%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-141b<D>1991</D><D>9</D><D>18%</D></ITAG>Foam Packaging:<ITAG tagnum="2">Product Substitutes<D>1988</D><D/>f 3-5<D/>f 10-51%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-22<D>1988</D><D>2</D><D/>f 0-90%</ITAG>Aerosols:<ITAG tagnum="2">Carbon Dioxide<D>1988</D><D>4</D><D>25%</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">HCFC-22 Blends<D>1988</D><D>2</D><D>25%</D><F/><T4>Notes:</T4><F/>a Year in which technology initially becomes available for commercialuse.<F/>b Years until maximum use of technology is achieved.<F/>c Possible reduction in CFC use for the sector in 1998 for thiscontrol only.

It shows that substantial increases intotal costs (from just over $1 billion in Case 2 to almost $3 billion inCase 1 through the turn of the century) would result. It also shows thatwindfall profits (pre-tax) through the year 2000 would as much as triple,going from just under $2 billion in Case 2 to over $7 billion in Case 1.CFC prices would shift from no increase in the initial years under theCase 2 scenario to price increases of $5-6.00/kg in the early years underthe Case 1 scenario.Based on this analysis, it appears that control actions in the next fewyears will have a substantial impact on short-term costs of reducing useof CFCs and halons, but far less impact on longer-term costs. However,short-term price effects are critical to encouraging an orderly transitionaway from these chemicals with minimum disruption to the nation's economy,and in avoiding adverse environmental consequences discussed above.The extent to which near-term price increases can be minimized is alsocrucial to the ability of potentially vulnerable industrial users of CFCs(e.g., certain foam applications) to maintain their markets prior to theavailability of chemical substitutes. If these firms are not confrontedwith steep near-term price increases, they will be better able to continuemanufacturing until chemical substances become available.B. Criteria for Selecting Direct ControlsThe December 14 proposal outlined several criteria EPA may use to developpossible controls. First, the Agency would review low-cost reductions currentlyavailable within each user group. It is these reductions that EPA believesthat industry will or should undertake during the initial years of theallocated quota system. For some end use applications, low-cost optionsmay not currently be available; for others, control options are currentlyavailable but may not be implemented due to the small cost of CFCs relativeto the total cost of the product or due to the ability to pass higher costson to consumers. EPA intends to closely monitor the pace at which reductionsare being made and if necessary develop control requirements. EPA is requestingcomment on the level of reduction in CFC and halon use or rate of progresstoward substitutes which EPA should expect within these industries to indicateeach industry's commitment to reduction in use of these chemicals.Second, the Agency will be concerned with the administrative burden associatedwith monitoring compliance and enforcing its regulations. EPA may targetend use applications where volumes of CFCs and halons consumed are easilymonitored or where uses can be banned, rather than mandating tecnology-basedcontrols which generally require extensive compliance with monitoring andsite inspections by EPA inspectors.Finally, EPA will avoid, if possible, direct regulations on small businesses.The Agency believes that the small business community should not bear aninordinate burden relative to larger businesses to comply with the stratosphericozone program. Furthermore, it is much more likely that small businesswill undertake measures to reduce their use of controlled substances sincethey will be unable to absorb large increases in the price of CFCs andhalons. The large number of small businesses potentially regulated alsopresents compliance monitoring and enforcement problems.EPA will closely monitor industry responses to today's final rule and reviewthe development of reductions in CFC and halon uses over the coming years.EPA believes that if reductions do occur then subsequent price increasesof controlled substances will be moderate. If available reductions arenot adopted, however, and prices increase significantly, this would signalthe need for direct controls on user applications. EPA is also seekingpublic comment on the possible role of voluntary, as opposed to mandatorycontrols, and the potential to use some form of negotiated rulemaking processwith specific user groups.C. Potential Near-Term User RegulationsBased on the analysis contained in its RIA and the criteria described above,EPA has identified several industry sectors where direct regulation inthe near term may be appropriate. To understand the impact of controlsimplemented within individual sectors, EPA estimated, through the IAM model,price increases of controlled chemicals when an individual sector aloneadopts low-cost controls. In some instances, sectors which use a relativelysmall percentage of the total of controlled substances can prevent largeprice increases if controls can either substantially eliminate CFC usein the sector or can be used by a high percentage of firms in that sector.In contrast, CFC price impacts from controls in a larger CFC user sectormay not be as great due to limited market penetration.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Automobile Air Conditioning</ITAG>Approximately 25 percent of all domestically-consumed CFCs are currentlyused in auto air conditioners, making it the single largest use of thesechemicals. Moreover, current servicing practices result in substantialunnecessary emissions of CFC-12. Typically, any CFC-12 remaining in theauto air conditioner is first vented to the air, a new charge of CFC-12is sometimes used to test the system and to locate the leak, and finallythe system is recharged. Additional waste may occur when ``do-it-yourselfers''either charge systems repeatedly what repairing the levels, overchargesystems, or discharge unused chemical from the small cans used to rechargesystems.Several groups (automobile manufacturers, servicing trade associationsand recycling equipment manufacturers) are not working together to developa standard for recycling CFC-12 for car air conditioners. If this stepalone were taken, the resulting reductions in CFC demand would reduce theprice of CFCs in 1989 from $6.69/kg in the Case 1 scenario to $4.49/kg.Because of the importance of this step, EPA intends to closely monitorprogress toward recycling by this industry segment and intends to developmandatory regulations requiring recycling in all service shops by 1992if near-term progress toward the use of recycling in this industry segmentdoes not occur.In addition, DME/12 blend, a mixture of CFC-12 and dimethylether, is apotential ``drop-in'' replacement for CFC-12, and has considerably lowerozone-depleting potential than CFC-12. Assuming the additional tests ofthis blend that are underway prove that it can safely be used in existingauto air conditioning systems, EPA believes that automobile manufacturersand service repairmen could replace CFC-12 with the DME/12 blend duringinitial charging and future servicing. EPA estimates that the DME/12 blendcould replace 20 to 30 percent of CFC-12 used in these applications ifsuch a practice is accepted under the automobile warranties which currentlyrequire pure CFC-12 as the replacement refrigerant. If adopted, DME/12blend could reduce price increases from $6.69 per kilogram in Case 1 to$2.21 per kilogram.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Hospital Sterilization</ITAG>Hospital sterilization accounts for 4 percent of all CFCs used within theUnited States. Although this application consumes a small percentage relativeto other uses, there are several immediate opportunities to decrease itsuse of CFC-12. To minimize CFC price increases, hospitals could expandtheir use of disposable medical items, potentially displacing 45 percentof CFC-12 used for sterilization. Hospitals could also contract to havesterilization done by external facilities which would use less CFC-12 intotal than individual hospitals, saving approximately 5 percent of CFC-12currently used in this application. Finally, alternate blends of chemicalsand steam cleaning could together displace an additional 45 percent ofCFC-12 used within this application.There are several obstacles to the adoption of these technologies. Acceptanceby hospital administrators, physicians and staff who may be biased towardmore traditional means of sterilization is crucial. Further developmentof off-site sterilization facilities and disposable instruments are alsonecessary. Finally, any new sterilants must be submitted to and approvedby EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Ifthese alternatives were available and implemented in 1988, price increasescould be reduced from $6.69 per kilogram to $2.21 per kilogram in 1989.Due to this potential saving for a relatively small user groups, EPA intendsto monitor this user industry and require a ban of CFC-12 use in hospitalsterilization if expected reductions do not occur.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Aerosols </ITAG>Current uses of CFCs in aerosols were exempted from the 1978 aerosol banand account for approximately five percent of the total CFC usage in theUnited States. Several alternative aerosol propellants and alternativedelivery systems have been developed since the original aerosol exemptionswere granted. A complete ban of CFCs within aerosols would reduce the priceincrease in 1989 from $6.69 per kilogram in Case 1 to $2.79 per kilogram.EPA may propose product labeling and further restrictions on aerosol use.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Solvents </ITAG>Approximately 12 percent of all domestically consumed CFCs are used insolvent cleaning of metal and electronic parts. This area also has severalpotential alternatives or process modifications to minimize the use andthus the demand for CFC-113. The use of terpene and aqueous cleaning assubstitutes for CFC-113 based solvents can provide approximately a 50 percentreduction in CFC-113 within this application by 1998. The timely applicationof CFC-113 azeotropes or mixtures and improved housekeeping practices tominimize vent losses or spills could further reduce CFC demand by an additional20 percent. If all controls are adopted, the expected price rise is only$1.95 per kilogram, rather than $6.69 under the ``Case 1'' scenario. EPArecognizes however that solvent applications are difficult to characterizeand that not all uses could shift to the suggested alternatives. Whileseveral large firms have recently made substantial strides toward reducingtheir reliance on CFCs, EPA will closely monitor this industry to determineif direct regulations are required and to better define which applicationsshould be controlled. D. Potential Long-Term Reductions and Controls <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Commercial Air Conditioning </ITAG>The December 14 proposal described several trends within the commercialair conditioning sector away from the controlled substances. Commercialchillers have already begun to shift to HCFC-22, CFC-502 and CFC-500, whichare chemicals and mixes with ozone depletion weights that are significantlylower than CFC-11 and CFC-12. CFC recovery during routine maintenance wouldfurther reduce CFC emissions. Recovery of refrigerant during maintenanceis not currently standard industry practice. Regulations requiring recoverymay be necessary to ensure low cost reductions are made as CFC prices increase.For the future, alternative chemicals such as HCFC-134a, HCFC-123, DME/CFC-12or HCFC-22/142b may replace CFC-11 and CFC-12 in new equipment. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Automobile Air Conditioning </ITAG>Over the long term, EPA believes that the automobile manufacturers willhave several chemical substitutes available. One promising alternativeis HFC-134a, a chemical that the major automobile manufacturers, in theircomments, pointed to as the most likely substitute, but one that will requireseveral years to develop, test and begin integrating into the automobilefleet. However, other chemicals are also under active consideration worldwide.Finally, as discussed above, a blend of dimethylether and CFC-12 may beanother possible alternative to pure CFC-12 refrigerant in existing andnew equipment. Although future automobile air conditioners may contain HFC-134a or someother refrigerant, the existing fleet of automobiles will continue to consumeCFC-12. Venting during repair and losses due to refrigerant trapped withindiscarded containers contribute to large emissions of CFCs when eventuallyreleased. As mentioned earlier, EPA is investigating the possibility ofrequiring recycling at time of servicing and the use of a DME/CFC-12 blendas replacement coolant. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Electronics and Metal Cleaning </ITAG>The electronic industry uses CFC-113 as a solvent; its use has grown substantiallyover the past years due to health concerns about alternative chlorinatedsolvents. The December 14 proposal noted that the high cost of CFC-113and the fact that it is recoverable makes it economically attractive torecover and recycle CFC-113. For the same reason, EPA believes recoveryand recycling are possible candidates for mandated controls. Existing equipmentfrequently does not have automatic covers or hoists (in the case of opentop vapor degreasers) to reduce losses. Better operating practices or ``housekeeping''could further reduce CFC losses. As mentioned above, alternatives suchas aqueous cleaners or terpenes, are likely to play a large role in reducingthis user group's dependence on CFC-113 and other chlorinated solvents.EPA expressly does not view shifting from CFC-113 to other chlorinatedsolvents which are currently under regulatory scrutiny as an acceptablesolution to protecting the ozone layer. Several commenters questioned EPA's previous estimates that aqueous cleaningwould replace a large share of CFC-113 use. EPA does estimate that 50 percentof CFC-113 will be replaced by both aqueous and terpene-based solutions.Commenters believed that the diversity of the electronics manufacturingindustry makes it necessary to examine the suitability of these substituteson a case-by-case basis and that across the board recommendations or controlsare not possible. EPA recognizes the diverse nature of the electronics industry and willaccount for this diversity should direct controls be considered. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Flexible Foam </ITAG>EPA discussed in the December 14 proposal possible controls applicableto the flexible foam industry, including makers of polyurethane foam slabstock.CFC-11 is an auxiliary blowing agent used by slabstock makers who manufacturecushions, mattresses and bedding. At this time, no chemical substitutesare currently available, but EPA believes that flexible foam-blowers maymanufacture slabstock without CFCs. The elimination of the auxiliary blowingagent would result in firmer, higher density foam cushions for automobileseats. Over the longer term, modified polyols may be used to decrease foamdensitiy to provide a softer foam simlar to CFC-11 blown foam. In addition,foam-blowers may increase water content of the foam to reduce density.In the long term, HCFC-123 or another chemical substitute may become aviable replacement for CFC-11 in many foam applications. In response to EPA's discussion in the proposal, several automobile manufacturersindicated that efforts to replace CFC-11 in molded flexible foam seatsfor automobiles have been fairly successful, and that water-blown technologiescan create the proper foam densities. Given the success with automobilecushioned seats, a ban of CFC-11 within this application may be appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Commercial and Residential Refrigeration</ITAG>Like commercial air conditioning, commercial refrigeration is shiftingtoward other less ozone-depleting chemicals such as HCFC-22, CFC-502 andCFC-500. Manufacturers can also reduce emissions through alternate leaktesting and recovery of CFC-12 during rework of the unit during test runsin the factory. Over the long term, HFC-134a or some other chemical substitutemay replace CFC-12 in new equipment. A wide range of alternative refrigerantsare also being explored for residential refrigerators.Twenty commenters claimed that there were no currently available alternativesto CFC-11, 12 and 502. Industry also believes that the adoption of HFC-134aas a future alternative chemical will require large capital costs as factoriesretool to produce new refrigeration units. EPA is currently reviewing thepossibility of HCFC-22, dimethylether/CFC-12, and HCFC-22/142b as substitutesfor these end use applications. In the near term, increased use of recoveryand recycling of refrigerant during servicing and use of DME/12 blend maybe the most attractive options. Over the longer term, new refrigerantswhich reduce dependence on CFCs without sacrificing energy efficiency willrepresent the most acceptable market solutions.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Rigid Insulating Foams</ITAG>CFC-11 is used as a blowing agent to make various forms of insulating foamssuch as polyurethane, isocyanurate, and phenolic foams. In the short term,HCFC-22 can be used in polystyrene insulation, and blends may be developedwhich reduce use of CFC-11, but there are no commonly accepted chemicalsubstitutes for other rigid foams. There are possibilities that productsubstitutes may attract part of the insulation market from this end useapplication. Over the long term, HCFC-123 or HCFC-141b may become an attractivemeans of reducing this use of CFC-11.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Rigid Packaging Foams</ITAG>Polystyrene foam is widely used in the food packaging industry. CFC-12is primarily used as a blowing agent and currently competes with pentane.In contrast to pentane, which is flammable and contributes to air pollution,HCFC-22 may be a more suitable substitute for CFC-12. The Food and DrugAdministration has recently approved the use of HCFC-22 in food serviceapplications. The most comprehensive data on HCFC-22 for polystyrene foamsuggests that firms will incur only limited capital costs and that operatingcosts are not expected to increase with the adoption of HCFC-22. In responseto the development of this alternative, the industry has proposed to phase-outvoluntarily the use of CFC-12 in food packaging by December 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Total Flooding Fire Extinguishant Systems</ITAG>Halon 1301 is used as the agent in total flooding fire extinguishant systemsto protect computer centers, document rooms, libraries, military installation,etc. Due to its unique features (non-toxic, non-residue forming), thereare currently no available substitutes.EPA believes that in the short term voluntary reduction will occur withinthe industry to reduce unnecessary emissions. Discharge testing of newsystems using halons is being reduced or even eliminated as alternativetest gases are being developed and employed. EPA's analysis of halon emissionpatterns indicate that only approximately 25 percent of all halon emissionsare emitted to fight an actual fire. All other emissions are a result ofaccidental discharges, training procedures, and system and discharge testing.Research efforts must focus on better ways to design systems which requireless agent for the required protection, on appropriate methods for determiningwhen halon protection is in fact necessary, and on the development of chemicalsubstitutes.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Halon Fire Extinguishers</ITAG>Halon 1211 is used extensively in portable fire extinguishers in marketswhere concerns exist about human exposure to and harm from residues fromother agents. In addition to this market, portable fire extinguishers havepenetrated consumer markets and some percentage are now purchased and usedfor applications where other fire extinguishing agents would be suitable.EPA is currently considering restricting the sale of portable halon extinguishersfor home use. Small halon extinguishers are relatively inexpensive andare purchased even where other agents might be used. Mandated controlscould limit the sale of extinguishers in markets where substitutes arereadily available.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Sterilization</ITAG>The December 14 proposal outlined several available ways of reducing theuse of CFC-12 to sterilize medical equipment. These options include theuse of mixtures of carbon dioxide and ethylene oxide, cobalt radiation,and recovery of CFC-12 with carbon adsorption and refrigerated condensers.Several commenters on the December 14 proposal disagreed that these optionsare available, stating that no widely available means of reducing CFC-12use are as safe or effective as the ethylene oxide and CFC-12 mixture.EPA continues to believe that the options are commercially available andhave been successfully demonstrated in the United States. Two of the methods,cobalt and gamma irradiation of equipment, have proven successful and indicatepotential for future growth. The carbon dioxide and ethylene oxide mixturemay require chamber replacement, and pure ethylene oxide for sterilizationwill require an explosion proof chamber, but over a long time period itmay be cost-effective for commercial sterilizers and large hospitals toswitch to these alternatives. For these reasons, EPA believes that sterilizationend use application may be a likely candidate for direct controls.E. Barriers to Reducing CFC and Halon UseEPA is also seeking public comment on specific institutional barriers toreducing the use of CFCs and halons. Several commenters expressed concernsthat such factors as energy efficiency standards, purchasing specifications,conflicting environmental laws and regulations, states and local codes,industry warranties, etc., may impede progress in moving away from ozone-depletingchemicals.EPA has initiated or is participating in studies in several of these areasto determine what steps are necessary to reconcile potentially conflictinggoals and to remove needless institutional barriers. EPA welcomes additionalcomment on relevant aspects of this issue.F. LabellingIn addition to the allocated quota system, auctions, and direct controlsfor specified user industries, EPA is also considering labelling requirementsfor products containing or manufactured with CFCs. As discussed in theDecember 14 proposal, EPA believes labelling provides useful informationto consumers, increasing their awareness of the ozone issue and allowingthe public to make informed decisions on purchases. In turn, a change indemand will assist the industry in moving toward alternatives. Indeed,EPA believes labelling was an effective impetus in moving industry awayfrom CFC use before the 1978 aerosol ban and has been proposed by severalother nations (e.g. Canada and European Economic Community) as part oftheir plans to implement the Montreal Protocol.Ten commenters believed that labelling could be an important part of thefinal EPA regulation, providing consumers with information that will allowthem to make choices which protect the ozone layer, helping to preventthe misuse of CFC and halon products, and providing a marketplace incentivefor manufacturers either to implement promptly a substitute for CFCs orto alter their products to eliminate CFCs.Seventy-four commenters opposed a labelling requirement, believing thatlabelling would adversely affect their business. Commenters stated thatlabelling could cause consumer panic and affect industry's research anddevelopment efforts. User groups believe that labelling will drive up thecost of products, and adversely affect firms where chemical substitutesare not available.Currently, EPA has not fully investigated the potential costs and benefitsof labelling in either general or specific applications of the requirement.EPA intends to further investigate the need for and potential role of labellingand requests additional comments on this possible future requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (1987), <T3>Economic Implications of Potential Chlorofluorocarbon Restrictions,</T3>Final Report, Putnam, Hayes andamp; Bartlett, Inc., December 2, 1987</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Decanio, Stephen J., ``Allocated Quotas and Regulatory Fees: A MixedStrategy for CFC and Halon Control,'' The Economics Group, Inc., SantaBarbara, CA, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">EPA (1987), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, <T3>Assessing the Risks of Trace Gases That Can Modify the Stratosphere,</T3>EPA 400/1-87/001, December 1987</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">EPA (1987), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, <T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis: Protection of Stratospheric Ozone, </T3>December1987</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">EPA (1988), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, <T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis: Protection of Stratospheric Ozone, </T3>August1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Nelson, T.P.
