The struggling airline, a unit of New York-based Pan Am Corp., acted after the Transport Workers Union, which represents 5,200 mechanics, fleet service workers and flight dispatchers, accepted work-rule changes expected to save $81 million over the three years of the contract. Pan Am then withdrew its demand for wage reductions and said it wouldn't seek to sell its South American routes or its large Miami maintenance base.    The tentative agreement, which received the unanimous endorsement of the union's negotiating committee, still must be put to a membership vote. The development nonetheless puts pressure on two of Pan Am's other unions, the Independent Union of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters, to reach accords with the cash-strapped, debt-ridden company.    The flight attendants in May overwhelmingly rejected the company's request for wage reductions, but they are to restart negotiations in September. The Teamsters, who also rejected the company's demands, are working under an imposed contract that includes an 8% wage reduction. Unions representing Pan Am's pilots and flight engineers already have agreed to take 22% wage cuts.    If the Transport Workers also ratify their contract, Pan Am will be able to save $145 million in each of the next three years. Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman and chief executive officer, is seeking annual cost savings of $180 million. Such savings will provide the carrier with a needed financial boost but still fall far short of solving its long-term problems.    The airline has one of the oldest fleets and some of the highest debt in the industry. Its weak domestic route structure and its lack of a sophisticated computer reservations system also are likely to hamper any prospect for recovery. And it still is possible that the Teamsters might decide to call a strike or that negotiations with the flight attendants will drag on.    William Genoese, director of the Teamsters' airline division, said the union might try to force Pan Am to soften its position on wage reductions now that the company has settled for work-rule concessions from the Transport Workers. A Pan Am spokesman said the company withdrew its demand for a wage reduction from the Transport Workers because Pan Am mechanics are already among the lowest paid in the industry.    Officials of the flight attendants union declined to comment. But an official close to the company said management is prepared to offer the attendants a new contract with smaller wage cuts to reach a quick agreement.    Despite Pan Am's long-term problems, industry analysts called the settlement with the Transport Workers a significant step in the right direction. &quot;What's important is that Pan Am is getting all its ducks lined up for next year,&quot; Louis A. Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said. &quot;If the economy is no worse then, with these concessions in hand, the airline just might be profitable&quot; in 1989.    Because Pan Am didn't win wage concessions earlier in the year, the company probably will report a loss of between $35 million and $40 million for the year, Mr. Marckesano said. He said that because of strong traffic on its international routes and East Coast shuttle service, Pan Am might have been marginally profitable this year if the wage concessions had come earlier. Pan Am had a 1987 loss of $265.3 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Pan Am shares closed at $2.75, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
