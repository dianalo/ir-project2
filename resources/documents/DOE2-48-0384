Because salt tongues are impermeable and coverlarge areas of sediment, they have the potential to trap tremendous volumesof hydrocarbons. Field observations, laboratory experiments, and in-situmeasurements in salt mines indicate that salt behaves like a viscousfluid over geologic time. Consequently, the same mechanical principlesused to analyze igneous dike and sill formation can be applied to saltintrusions. Evidence suggests that salt tongues, like igneous sills,intrude sedimentary strata in which both horizontal principal compressivestresses exceed the overburden stress. This stress state exists in areasof regional tectonic or localized horizontal compression (e.g., in activethrust and foldbelts, in the toe regions of active growth fault systems,and around the flanks of intruding diapirs). This model puts constraintson both the timing of emplacement and the location of salt tongues.</TEXT></DOC>
