($685) and Micro Planner X-Pert 1.04 from Micro PlanningInternational ($1,995).andP;  Open Plan/Mac 3.2 from Welcom Software Technology($4,200), a very large-scale system similar to those on mainframes, requiresFoxBASE+/Mac to run.andP;  AEC Information Manager 1.22 from AEC ManagementSystems Inc. ($695), a flat-file database add-on for other project managementsystems, tracks project paperwork.andM;These programs all need serious Macintoshes to do their jobs well, althoughthey could run on an SE equipped with a hard disk and 4 Mbytes of RAM.andP;  Wedid our testing on a Mac IIci and a Mac IIfx, both with8 Mbytes of RAM andlarge hard disks.andM;Micro Planner X-Pert 1.04.andP;  For a long time, Micro Planning International'sfirst Micro Planner program was the only competition for Apple's originalMacProject.andP;  Micro Planner also was the first Mac package to incorporate themainframe- and PC-based techniques demanded by professional project managers.andM;Micro Planner X-Pert (MPX) is Micro Planning International's most completeMacintosh system.andP;  It goes well beyond the capabilities of the company'sless-expensive product, Micro Planner Plus.andP;  MPX is for professionals whodaily manage multiple projects incorporating many levels of complexity.andP;  Assuch, MPX is an amazingly powerful system.andM;MPX was built to hold a lot of detailed project data (see project-capacitytable below).andP;  This capability more than any other helps set this entirecategory of expen-sive project-management software apart from less costlysystems, such as Claris Corp.'s MacProject II and Symmetry Software Corp.'sKeyPlan.andP;  But prodigious data handling would be worthless if MPX couldn'talso manipulate that data the way project-management pros need to.andM;MPX delivers the goods here, too.andP;  MPX supports both the arrow technique (seeglossary, Page 60) and precedence diagrams for project definition andcreation.andP;  It can even mix the two methods in a single chart.andP;  This means thesoftware can be adjusted to suit the project-management pro rather than viceversa.andP;  That's one reason MPX costs $1,995.andP;  It's meant to be a very flexibletool in the right hands.andM;Creating and managing an MPX project is surprisingly easy, given the surfeitof features the program incorporates.andP;  You start a project by breaking itdown into tasks using MPX's work breakdown outliner.andP;  You can then cut andpaste tasks from the outline to your arrow or network chart, which is theheart of any MPX project.andP;  Surprisingly, the outliner cannot create thischart view directly.andM;Once you have the basic project tasks recorded, you estimate the time it willtake to complete each task, defining the work schedule (calendar) for theproject.andP;  MPX makes all this happen very fluidly, even letting you break downlarge projects into subprojects so that charts don't get out of hand.andM;Using MPX's automated time-analysis tools, you can check out your proposedtask sequence to determine when an operation could start or finish withoutmucking up the expected project completion date.andP;  This time analysis thenidentifies the project's critical path.andM;Like most full-featured, mainframe project-management programs, MPX lets youenter just about as many project resources (such as personnel, budget,equipment and supplies) for each task as you could possibly need.andP;  Theseresources can be analyzed to determine when they might cause you to missmilestones or the project completion date.andP;  The analysis also can be used toautomatically level available resources, so that time constraints onresources affect the critical path as little as possible.andP;  To get an evenmore detailed look at the cost side of resources, MPX has an extensivecosting function that forecasts cash flows, creates and modifies budgets soyou don't have to export data to a spreadsheet for analysis, and figures thecost per task.andM;MPX's reporting scheme also leaves out little, offering more report stylesand types than most project managers will ever use.andP;  But again, this is partof the MPX gestalt -- to give project-management pros just about everypossible tool and then let them decide which ones to use.andM;Despite MPX's prowess, we had no trouble installing and using the programright from the start.andP;  Since the program can import files from MacProject II2.0 or later and Micro Planner 6, as well as information from mainframe-basedproject-management systems, it's likely that MPX can fill your needs.andP;  If youneed a complete and self-contained project-management behemoth, MPX is a goodchoice.andM;Project Scheduler 4.andP;  Scitor, like Micro Planning International, has been inthe project-management consulting and software business for years.andP;  Thisexperience has paid off in an excellent project-management program for theMacintosh, Project Scheduler 4.andM;At one-third the cost of MPX, Project Scheduler 4 lacks some of thatprogram's multiplicity of features and can't handle behemoth-sized projects,but you'll find it works well for midsize and larger projects (500 to 2,000tasks) for which you need very good analysis and reporting tools.andM;Project Scheduler 4 includes the usual Gantt and network charts, true PERTanalysis capabilities, critical-path method (CPM), and enough levels of chartzooming so that you can focus in on any part of your project.andM;Project Scheduler 4 also can break down project tasks by either a workbreakdown structure or an organizational breakdown structure.andP;  You also cansummarize these breakdown reports either way, so it's easy to collapse amultitask project into a single chart for presentations.andM;Like MPX, you'll find resource-analysis capabilities within Project Scheduler4, including forward and reverse resource scheduling, so resources can beleveled to prevent over- or underallocation.andP;  Leveling does not change actualresource allocations in Project Scheduler 4 but simply moves tasks to timeperiods when resources won't be overallocated.andP;  If you have overallocationswithin a single task, you will have to reduce the resource units manually orincrease their availability.andP;  But the resource-filtered Gantt-chart displayof Project Scheduler 4 makes it very easy to find such situations.andP;  While theresource-analysis and leveling tools provided by Project Scheduler 4 aren'tas comprehensive or adjustable as in MPX, they will be more than adequate formost managers.andM;Using Project Scheduler 4 to handle multiple projects is easy, thanks to avery clear manual.andP;  Project Scheduler 4 also can handle project data from theIBM version, so mixed networks of Macs and IBM PCs and compatibles can beused cooperatively to manage very large interrelated projects.andP;  In many ways,Project Scheduler 4 is designed for the large corporate user, where a singlemanager is in charge of various projects drawing from a common resource pool.andM;Project Scheduler 4 was very easy to learn and use; it took less time to getup and running with this program than any of the others (see table, Page 62).andO;Like MPX, it includes on-line, context-sensitive help, so we didn't have torefer to the manual often.andM;Project Scheduler 4 was our clear favorite among the four programs reviewed.andO;It had the best compromise of features vs.andP;  cost and practicality.andP;  Althoughwe'd need MPX's plethora of tools for some very large and complicatedprojects, we prefer Project Scheduler 4 for smaller-scale use on a dailybasis.andM;Open Plan/Mac 3.2.andP;  If you're a mainframe or micro database aficionado, youmay appreciate Welcom's Open Plan/Mac, but we didn't.andP;  At $4,200 (plus the$595 cost of FoxBASE+/Mac from Fox Software Inc.), this project-managementmonster makes MPX seem like a system for novices.andP;  It's not that MPX lacksany significant features compared with Open Plan/Mac.andP;  It's just that OpenPlan/Mac manages to take an already-complex subject and make it even morecomplicated.andP;  Here's why we didn't like it:andM;First of all, the program isn't a stand-alone, despite its high price.andP;  Sinceit's essentially a dBASE program, it requires FoxBASE+/Mac.andM;Second, Welcom seems to assume that project managers want to spend most oftheir days doodling around inside a giant project-management database.andP;  Wedidn't.andP;  Although Open Plan/Mac can handle prodigious amounts of data, withprojects limited only by your hardware resources, it's not a system that'seasy to install, learn or get comfortable with.andM;Like MPX, Open Plan/Mac can handle both arrow and precedence diagrams.andP;  Italso includes all the time analysis, resource scheduling, reporting andmanaging features you need for big-time project management.andP;  Lack of featuresis not the problem.andM;The problem is that a tool for professional project managers is touted as atool for ordinary managers, too.andP;  According to the manual, novices can useOpen Plan/Mac just because it has &quot;shell programs ...andP;  designed to allow anyuser, no matter how inexperienced, to perform all of the basic operations ofthe system.&quot;andM;While it's true that the menus are easy to operate, an understanding of whatis going on in the big project-management database underneath all those menusis anything but clear and not within the likely purview of an inexperienceduser.andM;Open Plan/Mac just isn't a general-purpose project-management program thatalso can be used to track small projects or schedules.andP;  If the documentationacknowledged that, perhaps the product would not have been so irritating touse.andM;If you are a project-management pro and have large amounts of data sitting indBASE format someplace else, or if you just require the services of a giantrelational database that happens to do project management, Open Plan/Mac isworth a look.andP;  But its high price and other software and hardware supportneeds have to be kept in mind.andP;  For many professional project managers, thelower-priced MPX is a better ultrahigh-end system that's considerably easierto learn and use.andM;AEC Information Manager 1.22.andP;  Brought to you by the same folks who make thelow-end FastTrack Schedule, AEC Information Manager (AIM) isn't afull-featured project-management system in its own right; instead, it is usedwith lower-end products such as MacProject II to give them substan-tiallyincreased data-management capabilities.andM;AIM works as a dedicated flat-file project-information database.andP;  It workswith MacProject II, Project Scheduler 4, Micro Planner 6, KeyPlan or otherproject managers that need the assistance.andP;  It lets you strap on seriousdata-management facilities to these less-expensive project-managementproducts.andP;  It also includes some niceties, such as an alarm for flaggingmilestones in your project.andM;AIM can import ASCII text from almost any program, even from PCs andcompatibles.andP;  It can also export in the same ASCII format.andP;  In short, AIM wascreated to make it easier to keep track of all the paperwork generated by aproject.andP;  In this regard, even Open Plan/Mac and Micro Planner X-Pert couldbenefit from the help that AIM provides, without the need for customprogramming.andM;The program lacks any PERT or CPM features of its own, relying on the parentprogram for those.andP;  Instead, AIM gives MacProject II and Micro Planner 6users a powerful organizational structure for keeping track of all the littletidbits of a project, from correspondence to phone messages.andM;AIM looks like a set of index cards when you fire it up.andP;  Since it's also adatabase, each index card functions as a record.andP;  These records hold specialAIM fields that point to other records, so the organizational metaphor caneasily be extended.andP;  For example, suppose you define a field for holdingproject notes and you call it a Special field.andP;  Because of this designation,the notes field points automatically to another record that can hold extendedtext describing the note entry.andP;  You can use this special field definition tobuild useful links among project data.andM;AIM displays most of its information as Gantt charts.andP;  The charts make iteasy to present information about such variables as equipment, vendors,approval processes and costs.andM;The program also makes it easy to search for specific information and sort itaccording to your own criteria.andP;  You could, for example, find all projectsubmissions outstanding for more than 10 days, sort them according to dateand display the results.andP;  With AIM you can produce charts showing theprogress of proposals and the appointments you have upcoming that couldinterfere with a project, as well as a directory of your projects and howthey break down.andM;Even if you already own a project-management program (low- or high-end), youcan probably benefit from the project database that AIM gives you.andP;  At $695,it's not cheap, but building a custom application to accomplish these taskswould be a big waste of time.andM;Conclusions.andP;  If your project-management needs can't be handled by KeyPlan orMacProject II, one of the packages reviewed here might be the ticket.andO;Project Scheduler 4 is a good bet if you will be managing a lot of separateprojects over a network with other managers and don't need everyproject-management tool under the sun.andM;Micro Planner X-Pert is for those project managers who do need every tool,and this system sure seems to have them.andP;  In addition, MPX has a surprisinglyshort learning curve, given its complexity.andM;On the other hand, Open Plan/Mac boasts even more power and complexity, butit's not for the average user.andP;  Unless you need an essentially unlimitedproject database, Open Plan/Mac is awfully expensive for what it provides.andM;Finally, just about any project manager can benefit from AIM, since itstreamlines project paperwork.andP;  Even if you buy Project Scheduler 4 or MicroPlanner X-Pert, AIM makes a nice adjunct.andM;Don Crabb is a senior lecturer for the department of computer science at theUniversity of Chicago and a contributing editor for MacWEEK.andM;andgt;AEC Information Manager: No information about support in manual;
