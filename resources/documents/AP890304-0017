Negotiations continued up to the deadline. But shortly aftermidnight, federal mediator Walter C. Wallace told reporters, ``Wehave not been successful in reaching agreement.   ``Eastern Airlines is officially on strike as of midnight,'' saidCharles Bryan, president of Eastern Machinists District 100. ``It'sshut down.''   PIcket lines went up around the country and pilots immediatelypledged to support the strike.   ``We voted unanimously to honor the picket lines,'' said JackBavis of the Air Line Pilots Association. ``That means as far as I'mconcerned the Eastern pilots are directed as of this moment not tofly Eastern airplanes.''   Tom Matthews of Eastern blamed the strike on the union'sinsistence on an 8 percent increase when the airline's others unionsaccepted a 20 percent wage cut three years ago.   ``This has to do with a union that has decided that it is notgoing to join with the other employees at Eastern who have made thesacrifices they've made,'' he said.   Matthews said Eastern would continue flying, albeit at a reducedschedule that he said was set to ``make sure people could havecontinued confidence in Eastern.''   The strike was called after Eastern made a new offer to the unionthat company officials said protected past wage increases and jobsecurity for 8,500 union aircraft mechanics and baggage handlers.   Wallace, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said the talksbetween the two sides ended on a ``professional if not cordial''note and that both sides were free to resume negotiations at anytime.   Bush, in an unprecedented action, earlier Friday had rejected arecommendation from federal mediators to order an emergency 60-daycooling-off period. Thirty-three senators and national labor leadersalso had urged him to name an emergency panel, a move that wouldhave averted a strike for at least 60 days.   The financially strapped airline said it opposed federalintervention.   Details of the company's last offer were not disclosed, althoughGeorge Brennan, an Eastern vice president, said it ``addresses the(union) concerns.'' The union earlier Friday rejected a companyproposal that would have cut mechanics' pay by 15 percent andbaggage handlers' wages by 26 percent.   A federal judge, meanwhile, ruled that Eastern machinists couldset up pickets against other airlines, but he prohibited Machinistsunion members at those airlines from joining the strike. AFL-CIOofficials had said members of all unions should honor the secondarypickets.   Wallace, speaking to reporters outside a hotel where talks wereunder way, said of Eastern's initial offer Friday, ``The other sideevaluated it and rejected it... It was a fizzle.''   Eastern on Thursday had offered to reduce the size of the wagetakebacks it has been demanding for the past 17 months from 8,500members of the International Association of Machinists and AerospaceWorkers.   The first offer Friday would have reduced hourly top-scale wagesfrom $18.83 to $16 for aircraft mechanics and from $15.60 to $11.54for baggage handlers.   In a non-strike action that could put pressure on all thenation's airlines, the Air Line Pilots Association announced that inthe event of an Eastern strike, it would instruct its 40,000 membersbeginning next Tuesday to precisely adhere to flying procedures thatwould cause ``substantial delays'' at the nation's airport.   Eastern said it would operate despite a walkout in an effort totrim by $150 million a year the wages paid to members of theMachinists union.   Bush, in a statement released at the White House, said, ``TheNational Mediation Board has for many months attemptedunsuccessfully to bring the parties to an agreement, and I have noreason to believe that an additional investigation or the 60-daydelay that would be entailed would produce such an agreement.''   He warned union officials against ``disrupting the nation'stransportation systems through secondary boycotts'' against otherairlines or transportation companies.   Bush said that if strikes against other transportation outletsoccur, he will seek emergency legislation to stop them.   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told a news conferenceFriday that Federal Aviation Administration inspections of Easternwere already being increased.   ``Eastern's service will be on planes that are safe andairworthy, and ... we will not tolerate any threats of sabotage orother forms of physical harm that threaten the health and safety ofpeople on the ground or in the air,'' Skinner said.   The union has said it has no plans for any such actions orthreats.   Skinner said, in answer to a question, that Bush retained thepower to call the emergency panel and prevent a strike _ even afterthe deadline _ but he indicated that was unlikely.   Congress could also invoke the emergency panel provision of theact. A panel would examine the dispute for 30 days and report to thepresident. A 30-day cooling-off period would follow before thecompany or union could take any action affecting jobs.   Eastern had said earlier that either a strike, if it involvedpilots, or presidential intervention delaying the strike, wouldlikely lead to bankruptcy. The company, which flies 100,000passengers a day with more than 1,000 flights, says it is losing $1million a day and has lost $1 billion over the past decade.   Pilots and flight assistants have said they will refuse to workbehind Machinists picket lines.   As the strike deadline approached, Eastern sent Machinists unionmembers home for a paid vacation day. The airline acted aftertelling a federal judge that the union planned last-minute sabotagethat threatened passenger safety.   ``This is not a lockout and is not an attempt to affect thebargaining,'' said airline spokesman Joe Leonard.   In U.S. District Court in Washington, Judge John H. Pratt said hewas ruling that Machinists union members at other airlines could nothonor Eastern machinists' picket lines there ``in view of the factthat there are no-strike clauses, no-slowdown clauses'' in theircontracts with the other airlines.   During the hearing, the attorney for USAir and Piedmont Airlines,Thomas Reinnert said the two airlines ``are total strangers to thedispute ... and we want to keep it that way.''   Also included at the hearing were representatives of NorthwestAirlines, TWA and United Airlines.</TEXT></DOC>
