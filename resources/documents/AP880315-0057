Mexican diplomats said the four members of the Mexican navalinfantry, carrying automatic weapons, crossed the border withoutrealizing it while in pursuit of alleged drug smugglers. The fourwere arrested without incident near the border and were released toMexican military officials late Monday.   U.S. Border Patrol officials said no charges would be filed, butthe State Department said the incident warranted further discussionbetween the two governments.   ``This action is an infringement of U.S. territorialsovereignty,'' said Bud Jacobs, a State Department spokesman inWashington, D.C. ``It's unacceptable regardless of their motivationor intention.''   ``I'm sure we'll take it up with the Mexican government,'' headded.   Mexican military or police have no authority to enter the UnitedStates when pursuing criminal suspects, Jacobs said.   ``The international line is marked clearly. It was not just aninadvertent entry,'' said Dale Cozart, chief agent in the U.S.Border Patrol's San Diego sector.   ``The line there is not clearly marked and the marines wereconfused,'' said Leonardo French, an official with the MexicanEmbassy in Washington. He added, ``What's important was that therewere no shots fired or any violence.''   The four men were arrested late Sunday night after a BorderPatrol helicopter crew spotted them talking with a group ofrevelers, U.S. officials said. U.S. officials said the armed menadmitted they knew they were in the United States when they crossedthe border.   Border Patrol spokesman Mike Nicley said the U.S. investigationwas complete and no charges would be filed.   He would not say whether U.S. authorities accepted the soldiers'explanation that they were pursuing drug smugglers. Americanauthorities failed to locate the revelers to find out what happenedduring the encounter.   Nicley said he didn't know what punishment the soldiers mightface in Mexico. American authorities described the soldiers asbeing equivalent in rank to privates.   In a similar 1986 incident in New Mexico, Border Patrol agentsarrested seven Mexican judicial police agents who said they hadaccidentally strayed less than a mile into New Mexico while on ananti-drug-smuggling assignment.   U.S. officials seized the stolen car the police officers wereoccupying, several automatic weapons, 6 grams of cocaine and$10,000 cash. Their commander said the officers probably didn'tknow the cocaine was in the car.   The seven were sent home after questioning and were not charged.   On July 16, 1977, an altercation between Tijuana police andmembers of the a joint Border Patrol-San Diego police unit left twoMexican officers and one San Diego policeman wounded.   San Diego police said the Tijuana officers were on the U.S. sideof the border, but Mexican police accused the Americans of firingacross the border.   A Tijuana officer was charged with assault with a deadly weapon.</TEXT></DOC>
