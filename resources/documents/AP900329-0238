But although Akers' compensation was shaved, the 3 percentreduction didn't compare with the 35 percent earnings slide atInternational Business Machines Corp.   IBM's 1989 profit totaled $3.76 billion, compared with $5.81billion in 1988. The company blamed a costly restructuring plan andunfavorable currency exchange rates for most of the decline.   Akers received $1,420,713 cash and IBM stock worth $519,976,bringing his total compensation as head of the world's largestcomputer company to $1,940,689, according to the statement.   In 1988, Akers received $2,000,500 in cash and stock. That wasthe first year his pay exceeded $2 million, said IBM spokesmanPeter Thonis.   Thonis said the company's profitability was just one factor insetting Akers' salary.   ``His pay isn't just a reflection of the year,'' but includesother factors, such as the company's long-term management, Thonissaid. In addition, the chairman's compensation is kept competitivewith that of heads of other major corporations, he said.   The pay and bonuses of IBM's top executives are set by theExecutive Compensation Committee, a group of the company's board ofdirectors that are not covered by the compensation plan.   Akers' actual salary last year was $712,500. The remainder ofAkers' compensation came from IBM's ``long-term performance plan,''adopted by stockholders last year to reward executives ``whoseperformance ... can have a significant effect on the success of thecompany,'' according to the proxy statement.   Akers received a cash award of $708,213 under this plan. He alsoreceived the $519,976 in stock under the plan, which he mustforfeit if he leaves the company within the next two years,according to the plan's terms.   None of IBM's executives received cash or stock last year underIBM's ``variable compensation plan,'' which is closely linked tothe company's fortunes. In 1988 and 1987, Akers received a combined$1,776,812 under the plan.   IBM President Jack Kuehler received total compensation last yearof $1,179,000, according to the proxy statement, down from$1,195,000 in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
