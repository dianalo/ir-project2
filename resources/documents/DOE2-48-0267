When Ga is substituted for Al theunit cell parameters and consequently the Nd-O distances increase, thereforecrystal field experienced by Nd/sup 3+/ and fluorescence quenching decrease.It is then possible to increase the concentration of the Nd/sup 3+/ activatorsions in the laser crystals. Synthesis, composition domain, optical propertiesand crystal growth of lanthanum-neodymium aluminogallates with a magnetoplumbite-likestructure are described.</TEXT></DOC>
