But that's about as far as the agreement goes.</LP><TEXT>   So while the Labor Ministry is hoping negotiations willproduce results soon, neither industrialists nor unionsbelieve an accord is likely for at least several months.   On the agenda is a whole series of issues, ranging fromproposals to simplify the various levels on which way paytalks are conducted to ideas for a more comprehensive stateincomes policy.   But undoubtedly the thorniest issue is the future of thescala mobile, the system of inflation-linked pay raises thathas been a cornerstone of the Italian employment system for45 years.   The employers' federation Confindustria insists thatindex-linking is inflationary, anachronistic and should beended. Union leaders are equally determined that it should bepreserved, even if in an amended form.   &quot;There are six or seven million workers who don't haveunion protection and who need an automatic mechanism . . .the scala mobile will change, but we cannot acceptConfindustria saying it is going to be abolished,&quot; saysOttaviano Del Turco, deputy leader of the CGIL union.   Unions say the scala mobile should not be allowed todominate talks that are supposed to tackle wider issues. Butfor Confindustria the problem is fundamental, because itfeeds consumer price rises straight back into labor costs,perpetuating inflation and putting Italian industry at adisadvantage to its competitors.   While the two sides are far apart on the scala mobile,there is an area on which they can agree -- the urgent needto reduce high social security charges on employers, whicheffectively double the cost of labor to employers whiledepressing net wages.   The high charges result mainly from Italy's expensive butinefficient public health service and near-bankrupt statepension system. Reform of both has been on the politicalagenda for years, but so far little headway has been made,despite the promise of imminent government action onpensions.   Both unions and employers are calling for the cost ofsocial services to be paid through general taxation, ratherthan through the current levy on employers. But thegovernment's problem is that raising the money throughindirect taxes could be inflationary, while increasing directtaxes could prove very unpopular in the run-up to a generalelection which must be held by June next year.   Unions are urging the government to raise funds bywidening the tax base, revoking a whole series of laws passedover the years granting tax relief or exemption to specialinterest groups. This, too, could be difficult for thegovernment to consider ahead of an election, however, and inany case resembles the attacks on tax evasion that arefrequently announced but tend to yield little revenue.   The government is instead hoping that the spotlight of thetalks can be turned towards a more general strengthening ofincome policy, extracting pledges from both sides of industryto negotiate wage raises respecting inflation targets.   The government is targeting a fall in inflation to 4.5%next year, 4.0% in 1993 and 3.5% in 1994 from the current6.8%, and has announced plans to hold public-sector wagerises to those levels. But there is skepticism over itsability to deliver on those promises.   &quot;This type of restriction has been written into policydocuments for the past four years,&quot; says InnocenzoCipolletta, director-general of Confindustria. However,generous pay awards by the state allowed public-sector wagesto soar 18.1% last year, more than twice as fast as the 6.8%rate in the private manufacturing industry and making privateindustry's pay bargaining position more difficult.   One approach Confindustria hopes to use to hold downinflationary wage claims is to simplify the pay bargainingstructure, eliminating some of the tiers.   The talks on reforming the system have been scheduled fornearly a year. Last July the government averted a threatenedgeneral strike by unions after Confindustria unilaterallyannounced its intention of pulling out of the scala mobile.Under the deal, all sides agreed to start talks on reformingthe pay bargaining system, once the round of sectoral paytalks then in progress had been completed.   The scala mobile system currently provides&quot;inflation-proofing&quot; for between 44% and 47% of the averageworker's salarymuch less than in the mid-1980s, but stillmaking Italy unusual in operating such a system. While unionshave conceded the principle of reforming the way it operatessomewhat -- possibly through the introduction of a minimumwage instead -- they are determined to preserve the benefitsit offers.   While the scala mobile is due to expire at year end,unless renewed, Mr. Cipolletta feels the talks could drag on,and that impetus for an accord may not come until the firstincrease due next year under the scala mobile is missing fromMay pay packets.</TEXT></DOC>
