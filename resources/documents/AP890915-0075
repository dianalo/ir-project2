Also today, the official press said in front-page editorials thatthe sacking of a provincial governor accused of corruption shows theCommunist Party will spare no high official found abusing his powers.   A measure similar to the ID card checks was instituted Sept. 1 inBeijing, which is under martial law, in an effort to round upalleged counterrevolutionaries still at large three months after thearmy crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.   No mention was made of the ``counterrevolutionaries'' whenauthorities announced today that nationwide checks would begin.   Instead, the Public Security Ministry said, ``The checking isaimed at providing convenience for citizens in their political,economic and other activities, guaranteeing their legal rights andstrengthening the administration and protection of the socialorder.''   Other measures are reported to have been implemented to clearBeijing of non-residents before the capital celebrates the 40thanniversary of Communist China on Oct. 1. Authorities appearconcerned that students and others who joined the popular movementthis spring might stage some kind of protest on National Day.   Chinese say notices have gone up in some work units orderingthose without papers authorizing them to live permanently in Beijingto leave by today. Only those with written permission fromauthorities above the provincial level to do business in the capitalare allowed to remain.   Hong Kong newspapers have reported restrictions on travel toBeijing, but government offices in a number of large Chinese citiesdenied any knowledge of such regulations.   The Beijing Foreign Affairs office, which handles questions fromforeign reporters, also said they were not aware of any travelrestrictions.   But Beijing Railroad Station is comparatively empty. China'sbusiest railroad station usually is teeming with people, withvirtually every bit of open space taken up by travelers who havecamped out while waiting, sometimes for several days, to buy tickets.   Chinese say strict security before Oct. 1 is normal, but manyalso say it has never been this strict.   The ID checks have scared away some of Beijing's transientpopulation of about 700,000 _ most of them peasants from thecountryside working at construction sites, selling vegetables,working as maids and doing other manual labor that city residentsdisdain.   The new measures are a turnaround from a gradual loosening ofrestrictions on movement in the past 10 years. In the past, a personneeded approval from several different government offices to leavehis village.   In recent years, however, traveling became much easier, and oftenthe only restriction was cost. The domestic tourism industry boomed,as Chinese with money set about seeing China's famous sites.   Hainan Governor Liang Xiang's dismissal, announced Wednesday,``completely expresses our party and government's determination andcourage to punish corruption,'' the Worker's Daily said.   Liang, governor since August of China's newest and most openprovince, was accused of aiding his wife and sons in real estate andauto speculation, illegally letting one of his sons settle in HongKong, and using public funds to buy clothes and hold banquets.   He is the highest ranking government official to fall since thebeginning of a campaign against corruption sparked in part by thecrushed student demonstrations of last spring, which made a majorissue of public corruption.   The 71-year-old Liang was closely associated with the reformistpolicies of Zhao Ziyang, who was purged from power and accused ofsupporting student dissent, but Hainan Communist Party chief XuShijie was quoted as saying Liang's fall was not a political matterconnected to Zhao.</TEXT></DOC>
