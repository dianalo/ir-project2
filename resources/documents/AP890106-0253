Reagan tossed the politically sensitive pay plan to Congressafter writing lawmakers that government jobs should not be ``theprovince only of the wealthy.'' He also urged lawmakers to abolishthe much-criticized honoraria system that permits them to earnappearance fees from special-interest groups.   The pay increase will become law automatically unless each houseof Congress rejects it by Feb. 8 _ 30 days from Reagan's formalbudget submission on Monday.   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who normally sets thechamber's agenda, said Friday that he would ``neither encourage norprevent a vote'' on the pay issue.   He added that ``if the pay raise takes effect, there will be aban on speaking fees and certain other forms of outside income. Theexact provisions for the severe tightening of outside earninglimitations are being drafted in bipartisan consultations.''   In the Senate, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, haspromised a vote.   In maneuvering two years ago, Congress allowed a 15.6 percent payraise to take effect. That time, the Senate voted 88-6 to reject theincrease. The House permitted enactment, then took a meaninglessvoice vote against the increase.   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, has said he thinks Wright ``is committedto making sure there is no vote.'' Tauke has proposed legislationrequiring Congress to vote on any pay raise, while delayingenactment until the next Congress.   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., called the pay raisepreposterous and said he had asked Senate leaders to schedule anearly vote on a resolution of disapproval.   ``The founding fathers meant for members to vote affirmativelyfor pay raises, as a means of ensuring accountability,'' Humphreysaid. ``Instead, we have a system which violates the spirit of theConstitution, if not the letter, by severing all accountability.''   Reagan chose not to modify a presidential commission'srecommendation that members of Congress and federal district judges,who now make $89,500 a year, be paid $135,000.   The speaker's annual salary would go from $115,000 to $175,000,and that of majority and minority leaders from $99,500 to $155,000.   Top executive-branch officials such as Cabinet members would getraises from their current $99,500 a year to $155,000.   Reagan's proposal would raise a president's annual pay to about$350,000 from the current $200,000, where it has stood since 1969.However, such a hike would not take effect until 1993 because of aconstitutional prohibition on raising a president's pay during histerm.   President-elect Bush said Friday he supported Reagan's decision,but may take another look at the issue when he becomes president.   Asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big payincrease at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits,Bush said: ``Well, I don't know whether we can afford anything thanto get this deficit under control.''   Reagan wrote Congress: ``We must ensure that the door to serviceremains open to Americans who must work to support their families,educate their children and save for their retirement.''   Addressing honoraria, Reagan said the fee system ``underminespublic faith in the integrity of senior federal officials,particularly in the legislative branch. Congress should moveimmediately to enact legislation that takes a comprehensive approachto the problems posed by honoraria, including payments for articles,speeches and appearances, and other forms of financial benefits.''   Under the system, senators can pocket up to 40 percent of theirsalaries in honoraria _ $35,800 for the rank-and-file members _while House members can hold on to 30 percent, or $26,850 for therank-and-file. Fees over that amount go to charity.   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriationslegislative subcommittee, said he was pleased with Reagan's decision.   ``This is a pay raise for all the top-level federal officials ...but, of course, we (Congress) take all the heat,'' he said.   Fazio said he believes the Senate is likely to reject the raise,as it has in past years when the House allowed pay hikes to takeeffect.   On Thursday, the nonpartisan National Taxpayers Union deliveredpetitions to the White House, saying they bear the names of 13,000people who oppose the raise.   The group's executive vice president, David Keating, said``Congress is hoping to batten down the hatches and weather a 30-daystorm of opposition.   ``The public is not going to give up after 30 days. They willjust get more angry at congressional double-dealing on the pay raiseissue.''   Keating also said Reagan has a personal stake in hisrecommendation because his pension would rise by 56 percent if thepay raise is approved. He said the pension is tied to Cabinetsalaries.   The pension increase from $99,500 to $155,000 annually also wouldapply to former Presidents Ford, Carter and Nixon, Keating said.   ``No employee of the federal government should be able to namehis own pension before retirement. Yet, that's exactly whatPresident Reagan has done,'' Keating said, adding that Reagan andthe three former presidents should refuse the increase.   A White House press spokesman, B.J. Cooper, said the taxpayerunion figures were accurate, but had no comment on the call forReagan to refuse the increase.   ``The president was not aware of that when he approved the payraise,'' Cooper said. ``I don't know whether it would have changedhis decision, the other factors being so overwhelming.''</TEXT></DOC>
