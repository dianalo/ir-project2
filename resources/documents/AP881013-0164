Hakim has filed a motion to obtain details of everything thatWillard I. Zucker told prosecutors about the secret Swiss bankaccounts and off-shore shell companies that were conduits formillions of dollars generated by the arms deals, according to courtpapers.   Zucker, a U.S. citizen who has lived in Switzerland for 20years, operates a financial consulting business in Geneva that haslong overseen Hakim's banking interests in that country.   A former Internal Revenue Service lawyer, Zucker has receivedimmunity from prosecution for his role in the Iran-Contra affair,and is listed as a prospective witness by independent counselLawrence E. Walsh.   Zucker's business, Compagnie de Services Fiduciares, S.A. (CSF),kept the financial records of the arms deals and set up a series ofdummy corporations and Swiss bank accounts for the armstransactions.   Hakim had ``long utilized the services of Mr. Zucker and CSF inthe conduct of his legal and business affairs,'' defense lawyerssaid. ``In so doing, he has often entered into confidentialcommunications with Mr. Zucker for the purpose of securing bothopinions on law and legal services.''   ``Mr. Zucker is a member of the bar who rendered legal servicesto Mr. Hakim, and Mr. Hakim has insisted that all communicationswith respect to those services remain confidential,'' defenselawyers N. Richard Janis and Lawrence H. Wechsler said in apleading that was ordered unsealed Wednesday by U.S. District JudgeGerhard A. Gesell.   An accounting of the information Zucker provided Walsh ``maywell result in the suppression of any effort by the government tointroduce at any trial either the testimony of Mr. Zucker or anyinformation derived directly or indirectly from government contactswith Mr. Zucker'' Hakim's lawyers said.   Defense lawyers threatened to try to prevent Zucker fromtestifying not only against Hakim but his three co-defendants inthe Iran-Contra conspiracy case: former national security adviserJohn M. Poindexter, ex-White House aide Oliver L. North and Hakim'sformer business partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord.   The four are charged with conspiring to defraud the governmentby diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sale to the Nicaraguanrebels.   Separate trials have been ordered for each defendant.   Prosecutors said in a pleading filed Thursday they were ready tobegin North's trial in January. They opposed further delays inpre-trial proceedings sought by North, contending the defense wasmerely trying to delay the trial.   Zucker's testimony would provide key evidence against all fourdefendants about the clandestine network of Swiss bank accounts andoff-shore dummy corporations through which arms-sale profits werediverted to the Contras.   His testimony would also support a charge that Hakim and Secordconspired to pay illegal gratuities to North, including thecreation of a $200,000 investment account at CSF and theinstallation of a $13,800 security fence around the former WhiteHouse aide's home in Great Falls, Va.   Zucker, an unindicted co-conspirator in this count of theindictment, met with North's wife, Elizabeth, in Philadelphia inMarch 1986 and later with Washington attorney David Lewis, theindictment says.   Lewis told congressional investigators that Zucker wanted him topass money to Mrs. North that would be disguised as compensationfor her role in a real estate deal. Lewis, who declined to becomeinvolved, testified that Zucker told him the money was owed North.</TEXT></DOC>
