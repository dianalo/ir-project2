There are in fact good reasons tocriticize Mr. Thornburgh's handling of the job, but theproblem is not the refrain that he was too political. WhenMr. Thornburgh got into trouble, the problem was that hedidn't possess the political strength of will to fend offdemands for abusive prosecutions of individual citizens by anoverwhelming powerful federal government.   The more conventional criticism of late is a variant onthe complaints against Mr. Thornburgh's predecessor, EdwinMeese; now, however, they are made more bitter by thedisappointment that Mr. Thornburgh, presumed to be apolitical moderate, actually helped carry out the policies ofhis less middle-of-the-road President. But on questions oflegal policy, Mr. Thornburgh performed precisely as a cabinetofficer should. He helped advance the executive branch'sposition on issues such as the quota bill, the crime bill anddefending the constitutional powers of the presidency againstan engulfing Congress.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thornburgh's critics, who want Justice to in effectsecede from the executive branch, forget the lesson GriffinBell taught Jimmy Carter. Mr. Carter in his campaign promisedto make Justice independent of the White House. Mr. Bell, hisAttorney General, spent the early months in office explainingthat the Constitution sets out only three branches ofgovernment, not an independent Justice Department. Justice,like all departments, answers only to the President, whichreflects the design of the Founders of a unitary executivebranch.   For example, Mr. Thornburgh's policy proposal for thecrime bill, whose passage President Bush called for in hisspeech Wednesday night, is what the Attorney Generaldescribes as the &quot;inclusionary rule.&quot; This would reform theabsurd exclusionary rule, which now lets both criminal andblundering police officer go free. Instead, a jury couldconsider evidence of a gun used in a crime, and anyconstitutional violation would be pursued separately againstlaw-enforcement officials. Justice was also instrumental inmaking good on Mr. Bush's promise to select more federaljudges committed to reclaiming the courts from liberalactivists.   Our problem with Mr. Thornburgh is not that he fulfilledhis constitutional role as the legal adviser to thePresident. It is that he failed in the other key duty ofAttorneys General: to make sure that federal prosecutors,with their extraordinary police powers, don't yield topressures to bring criminal cases against targets who arepolitically unpopular or suitable for free publicity.   In supervising the prosecutorial discretion of the 93 U.S.Attorneys' offices across the country under his control, Mr.Thornburgh too often gave in to political voices outside theBush administration, in particular the voices of vengeance.   To appease environmental extremists, he approved thenonsense criminal lawsuit claiming that Exxon intentionallydumped oil in Alaska. To please Congress's interests inavoiding accountability in the Sandamp;L crisis, Mr. Thornburghexaggerated the role of fraud and downplayed the role ofdeposit insurance.   So far Justice has left it to federal judges to reversethe headlined criminal prosecutions of the 1980s. In NewYork, the high-profile triumphs of former U.S. AttorneyRudolph Giuliani are evaporating as soon as they reach theappeals courts. Most recently Mr. Giuliani's conviction ofRobert Wallach in the Wedtech case was reversed. Reversals insecurities cases include the convictions of GAF for supposedstock manipulation and of a fourth-hand tippee of supposedinsider information.   Most conspicuously, Justice failed to correct its ownabuses of the RICO statute, twisting a law meant to helpprosecute Mafia groups into a rubber hose against individualsand institutions far afield from organized crime. RICOing ledto the pre-trial bankruptcy of the Princeton/Newportsecurities firm.   So while Mr. Thornburgh performed well as the President'schief legal adviser, his failure to protect the nobility ofthe law against abusive federal prosecutions mars his record.In selecting a successor, President Bush might note that thegreatest threat to civil liberties today is this cry forprosecutorial retribution. Mr. Bush should appoint someone tothe job dedicated to quieting the drumbeat that Justicemisuse the legal system for political ends. It is nopoliticization of the office to keep politics out of lawenforcement. Indeed, it is clearer than ever that this is thehighest duty of an Attorney General.</TEXT></DOC>
