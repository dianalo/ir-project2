East German Premier Lothar de Maiziere told East Berlin'sparliament yesterday that East Germany's budget deficit islikely to reach a staggering 120 billion West German marks bythe end of this year because of rising welfare costs andbusiness bankruptcies. At least 1.5 million of East Germany's8.5 million workers will have to be retrained or faceunemployment by the end of 1991, according to his report.</LP><TEXT>   Guenther Krause, a parliamentary state secretary and asenior East German negotiator in the monetary union talks,candidly told parliament that &quot;we slowly have to beginthinking about who will pay for these 120 billion.&quot;   The apparent appeal to Bonn comes as members in theGerman-German monetary commission, having agreed on a 1-to-1mark conversion rate for East German savings and wages, areat loggerheads over support for East Germany's crumblingwelfare system. The West German mark is scheduled to replacethe East German mark beginning July 2.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, before the Bonn parliamentyesterday, conceded that East Germany's budget and othermajor problems still defied solution, but he said the July 2date for monetary union remained intact.   In East Berlin, the Party of Democratic Socialism, therenamed Communist Party, accused Mr. de Maiziere's democraticgovernment of bowing to Bonn's terms for monetary union bynot demanding a better financial cushion for East Germanworkers and pensioners. While wages and pensions will bechanged into West German marks at a 1-to-1 rate, East Germanwages and pensions are only a third of West German levels,raising fears of impoverishment when a common German marketarrives.   East Germans also could face a doubling in their rents,which are heavily subsidized by the state. The uncertaintyboiled over yesterday as workers vented anger over possiblejob and housing losses, and farmers blocked major highways toback demands for continued price subsidies. Most East Germanfarmers also demand protection from West German competitors,whom they fear will pour in with well-oiled distributionsystems once the border is opened to unrestricted trade inJuly.   Industrial workers downed their tools yesterday in warningstrikes to protest subsidy cutbacks planned as East Germanyshifts from central planning to a free market. Joined intheir strike by East German teachers, the workers fear thattheir jobs at archaic plants face extinction in opencompetition with the West.   Citing the government study, Mr. Krause, the statesecretary, said only a third of East Germany's industrialenterprises are expected to be able to compete after monetaryand economic union. More than half are already operating at aloss, but they could be salvaged with subsidies. Theremaining 14% face imminent bankruptcy, the report said.   East German enterprises have a combined debt to the stateof about 260 billion East German marks. Monetary unionnegotiators are still wrangling over how -- and by whom --the sum is to be settled after July, when impoverished EastGerman enterprises will have to service their debt in hardWest German marks.</TEXT></DOC>
