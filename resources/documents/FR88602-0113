Exercise limits prohibit the exercise by an investoror group of investors acting in concert of more than a specified numberof puts or calls in a particular underlying security within five consecutivebusiness days.The proposed rule changes were noticed in Securities Exchange Act ReleasesNo. 24669 (July 1, 1987), 24701 (July 14, 1987), and 24971 (September 30,1987), 52 FR 26108 (July 10, 1987), 52 FR 27269 (July 20, 1987), and 52FR 37563 (October 7, 1987), respectively. No comments were received bythe Commission on the proposed rule changes.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction</ITAG>The purpose of the proposed rule changes is to increase position and exerciselimits for stock options by creating a limited exemption for the four mostcommonly used hedged positions. The current Amex, CBOE, and Phlx positionlimit rules circumscribe the number of option contracts on the same sideof the market (<T3>i.e.</T3>, short calls and long puts or long calls and short puts)that an investor may control. Position limits for equity options are determinedin accordance with a three-tiered system (<T3>i.e.</T3>, 3,000, 5,500, or 8,000 contracts) based on the number ofshares of the underlying security outstanding and/or the underlying security'strading volume.\5\<NOTE/> Exercise limits correspond to position limits, such thatinvestors are allowed to exercise, during any five consecutive businessdays, only the number of option contracts set forth as the position limit.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See</T3> Amex Rule 904, CBOE Rule 4.11, and Phlx Rule 1001.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See</T3> Amex Rule 905, CBOE Rule 4.12, and Phlx rule 1002.During the two-year pilot program, the proposals will allow an automaticexemption from equity option position and exercise limits for accountsthat have established one of the four most commonly used hedged positionson a limited one-for-one basis (<T3>i.e.</T3>, 100 shares of stock for one option contract). The four hedgedpositions, which combine stock and options on a one-for-one basis, are:long stock and short call; long stock and long put; short stock and longcall; and short stock and short put. Under the proposal, the maximum positionlimit (including the allowed exemptions) may not exceed twice the presentposition limit.The proposal contemplates that exercise limits will correspond to positionlimits. Therefore, investors will be allowed to exercise, during any fiveconsecutive business days, the same number of contracts set forth as theposition limit for that option, including those that are hedged (<T3>i.e.</T3>, if the position limit for an option is 5,500 contracts andan investor has established a hedged position of 6,500 contracts, the investorcould exercise all 6,500 option contracts during any five consecutive businessdays).In their rule filings, the exchanges stated that the proposed rule changeis a response to requests by institutional investors for the ability tohedge greater amounts of stock holdings than they can under the currentposition limit rule. The CBOE notes that in some instances it has beennecessary to grant market participants exemptions for existing equity optionposition limits. The proposed exemptions for long stock positions willprovide investors the ability to protect or hedge twice as many sharesof stock as they can under the current position limit rule with long putsor short calls. Similarly, the proposed hedged exemption for short stockpositions will permit investors to offset such positions with either longcalls or short puts. If either of these options positions is exercised,the shares of stock acquired or sold pursuant to the exercise will reducethe stock position and, therefore, will not add to the investor's totalposition in the underlying stock.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>Since the inception of standardized options trading, the options exchangeshave had rules imposing limits on the aggregate number of options contractsthat a member or customer could hold or exercise. These rules are intendedto prevent the establishment of large options positions that can be usedto manipulate or disrupt the underlying market so as to benefit the optionsposition. In particular, position and exercise limits are designed to minimizethe potential for mini-manipulations and for corners or squeezes of theunderlying market.\7\<NOTE/> In addition, they serve to reduce the possibility for disruptionof the options market itself, especially in illiquid options classes.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A mini-manipulation is conducted by effecting transactionsin the underlying security to profit a previously established options position(<T3>e.g.,</T3> purchasing stock to increase its price and, as a result,the value of call options), and then closing out the options position ata profit. Because of the substantial leverage provided by options contracts,a trader would be capable of accumulating a large enough position to resultin substantial profit from relatively small movements in the price of theunderlying stock. Corners and squeezes could involve the purchase of calloptions at a time when the option holder also has a substantial or evencontrolling interest in the underlying securities. The options would thenbe exercised, forcing uncovered options writers assigned to deliver stockon the exercises to buy the stock at increasingly higher prices becauseof the unavailability of the stock. The person effecting the corner orsqueeze would profit either by closing out his options position at a premiumor selling the underlying securities at inflated prices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21907 (March 29, 1985),50 FR 13440 (approving three-tiered position and exercise limits for individualstock options).The Commission previously has indicated that, in establishing positionand exercise limits, it has attempted to balance two competing concerns.On the one hand, limits must be sufficient to prevent investors from disruptingthe market for the underlying security by acquiring and exercising a numberof options disproportionate to the deliverable supply and average tradingvolume of the underlying security. On the other hand, limits must not beestablished at levels that are so low as to discourage participation inthe options market by institutions and other investors with substantialhedging needs or to prevent specialists and market makers from adequatelymeeting their obligations to maintain a fair and orderly market.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>Id.</T3>In 1978, the Report of the Special Study of the Options Market, while recognizingthe important functions served by position and exercise limit rules, setforth some of the deleterious effects of the 1,000-contract position andexercise limits then in effect.\10\<NOTE/> In particular, the <T3>Options Study</T3> suggested that position limit rules by completelyreviewed and their future elimination or relaxation, particularly for hedgedpositions, be considered.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ H.R. Rep. No. 1FC-3, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. at 189-91(Comm. Print 1978) (``Options Study'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The <T3>Options Study</T3> pointed out that, under rules promulgated by theCommodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), positions that are deemedto be bona fide hedging transactions (as defined) are exempted from positionlimit rules.In October 1980, The Commission approved proposed rule changes by the CBOE,the Amex, the Phlx, and the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. to increase positionand exercise limits from 1,000 to 2,000 contracts for all options classes.\12\<NOTE/> In July 1983, the Commission approved a further increasein position and exercise limits for individual stock options based on atiering approach.\13\<NOTE/> Limits for options on stocks with the greatest trading volumeand public float were increased to 4,000 contracts and limits on all otheroptions classes were increased to 2,500 contracts. In approving the increasedlimits under a two-tiered approach, the Commission recognized that securitieswith active and deep trading markets, as well as broad public ownership,are more difficult to disrupt than securities having less active and deepmarkets and having smaller public floats. Accordingly, the Commission believedthat the tiering approach to position and exercise limits was appropriatebecause it would increase the depth and liquidity of the stock optionsmarkets without significantly increasing concerns regarding manipulationand disruption of the market for the underlying securities. The Commissionnoted that the absence of discernible manipulation problems under the currentlimits was an indication that modest additional increases were justified.In addition, the Commission noted that tiering was consistent with thegradual evolutionary approach that the Commission and the options exchangeshave adopted in increasing position and exercise limits.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17237 (October 22,1980), 45 FR 71453.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19975 (July 15, 1983),48 FR 22289 (``1983 Release'').In April 1985, the Commission approved a three-tier structure that establishedposition and exercise limits of either 3,000, 5,500, or 8,000 contractsfor individual stock options depending on certain criteria related to thetrading volume and the number of shares outstanding of the underlying stock.\14\<NOTE/> In approving the proposals, the Commission concluded thatthe proposed increases, based on a three-tiered approach, would furtherincrease the potential depth and liquidity of the individual stock optionsmarket without significantly increasing concerns regarding intermarketmanipulations or disruptions of the market for the options or underlyingsecurities. The Commission noted, as it previously had noted in its 1983Release, that securities with active and deep trading markets, as wellas broad public ownership, are more difficult to manipulate or disruptthan those securities that are less active with smaller public floats.In this connection, the Commission believed, in particular, that the proposalto create a third tier, with a limit of 8,000 contracts, for options onthe most actively traded, widely held securities, permitted the Commissionto avoid placing unnecessary retraints on those options where the manipulativepotential is the least and the need for increased positions, both by tradersand institutional investors, likely would be the greatest. The Commissionnoted the absence of discernible manipulation or disruption problems underthe two-tiered limits in concluding that the proposed increases were warranted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21907 (April 3, 1985),50 FR 13440.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission has concluded that the CBOE, Amex, and Phlx proposals toincrease position limits for individual equity options in circumstanceswhere those excess positions are hedged fully with offsetting stock positionswill further increase the depth and liquidity of the stock options marketwithout significantly increasing concerns regarding intermarket manipulationsor disruptions of either the options market or the underlying stock market.In particular, the Commission believes that the proposals will providegreater depth and liquidity to institutional customers seeking to hedgestock portfolios by trading stock options. These investors will be ableto hedge twice the amount of underlying shares of stock than they currentlycan, and thus will be better able to protect their large stock portfoliosfrom market declines.The Commission also believes that the Amex, CBOE, and Phlx proposals areconsistent with the Commission's general approach to position and exerciselimits. That approach balances the benefits derived from increased positionand exercise limits against the potential for increased market disruptionsand manipulations. The Commission does not believe that the exemption fromposition and exercise limits will disrupt the options or equity marketsor substantially increase the possibility of manipulation in the underlyingstocks or options. In this regard, the Commission notes that the positionand exercise limit exemption is a limited one (<T3>i.e., </T3>the exemption is limited to accounts that have establishedone of four hedged positions). Moreover, because any option positions inexcess of current position limits must be hedged fully, market disruptionconcerns are lessened. In situations where the option position is hedgedfully with an offsetting stock position, potential disruptions in the underlyingstock market are lessened because the entity with the options positionis not required to enter the market to buy or sell the stock if the optionsare exercised or assigned. In addition, the Commission believes that amaximum position of double the existing position and exercise limits willhelp to ensure that any potential market disruptions are minimal. Finally,to the extent that an options position is hedged fully with stock, it ismore difficult to profit from an intermarket manipulation because an increasein the value of the options position usually will be accompanied by a correspondingdecrease in the value of the stock position.Nevertheless, larger options positions do raise the incentive to engagein intermarket manipulations by providing a greater potential gain fromthe derivative position. This is especially relevant to the CBOE, Amexand Phlx proposals in that the hedge exemptions will be available to marketprofessionals. In this regard, the Commission is confident that Amex, CBOE,and Phlx surveillance capabilities are sufficient to detect and deter tradingabuses arising from the increased position and exercise limits. Each exchangegenerates daily an automated position limit report. If an entity is identifiedas exceeding the existing position limit in a specific security, the surveillancestaff will discern immediately whether an offsetting stock position exists.If the excess options position is not hedged fully on a one-to-one basis,the entity loses the exemption, will be precluded from effecting additionalopening transactions, and will be required to close out those positionsin excess of the current position limit. In addition, the exchanges canproceed with whatever disciplinary action is appropriate under their rules.The Amex, CBOE, and Phlx also have noted that their surveillance departmentswill cross reference their position limit reports with their manipulationreviews to ensure that any unusual options or stock trading, whether fullyhedged or not, will be identified and investigated thoroughly.\1\\5\<NOTE/> In addition, the exchanges have indicated that any excessoption positions must be liquidated prior to or contemporaneously witha decrease in the hedged stock position or a violation of position limitswill be deemed to have occurred.\1\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission also notes that the exchanges have proposeda two-year pilot program for the equity option hedge exemption. Duringthe two-year pilot the exchanges and the Commission can monitor the effectsof the hedge exemption on the market to ensure that problems have not arisendue to the increased position and exercise limits.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ Letter from Nancy R. Crossman, Associate General Counsel,CBOE, to Joseph Furey, Esq., Division of Market Regulation, Commission,dated September 10, 1987; letter from Claire P. McGrath, Staff Attorney,Amex, to Joseph Furey, Esq., Branch of Options Regulation, Commission,dated September 3, 1987; telephone conversation between Howard Baker, SeniorVice President, Options Division, Amex, and Joe Furey, Branch Chief, Divisionof Market Regulation, Commission, October 6, 1987; telephone conversationbetween Michele Berkowitz, Staff Counsel, Phlx, and Mary Revell, Attorney,Commission, May 4, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Nancy Crossman, Associate General Counsel, CBOE,to Joseph Furey, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, Commission,dated October 9, 1987; letter from Claire P. McGrath, Staff Attorney, Amex,to Joseph Furey, Branch Chief, Division of Market Regulation, Commission,dated October 9, 1987; and telephone conversation between Michele Berkowitz,Staff Counsel, Phlx, and Mary Revell, Attorney, Commission, May 4, 1988.In this regard, the CBOE, Amex, and Phlx will conduct surveillance to detectany such violations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ The Commission expects the exchanges to determine fromtheir monitoring programs information including, but not limited to, thefollowing: the investors who use the exemption; how often the exemptionis used; the stock positions hedged; the amount and timing of trading inthe stock by the investor while he is using the exemption; the optionsused to hedge the stock positions; and the size (number of contracts) ofthe options positions held pursuant to the exemption. The exchanges alsoshould inform the Commission of the results of any surveillance investigationsundertaken for apparent violations of the provisions of the hedge exemptionrule.The Commission also notes that there does not appear to be any regulatoryreason to differentiate among the three tiers of current position and exemptionis concerned. Although the position and exercise limits for options inthe lowest two tiers are based on securities with a lower number of outstandingshares and/or with a lower trading volume, all securities underlying optionscontracts traded on the Amex, the CBOE or the Phlx must meet certain minimumoutstanding share and trading volume criteria.\1\\8\<NOTE/> Because any position in excess of the existing limit on thesame side of the market must be hedged fully by an offsetting stock position,market disruptions, regardless of differences in the trading of the underlyingstock, would be unlikely, and profits derived from one position would beoffset by losses associated with the other position. The Commission believes,therefore, that so long as there is significant trading volume and adequatepublic interest in the security to permit options trading, it is appropriateto allow an exemption from position and exercise limits for accounts thathave established one of the four hedged positions with options that havea current 3,000, 5,500, or 8,000 contract position limit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Generally, these requirements are: (1) A minimum of6,000 holders of record; (2) a minimum of 7,000,000 shares outstanding;(3) trading volume of at least 2,400,000 shares in the preceding 12 months;and (4) a minimum value of $10 per share for the underlying stock. <T3>See</T3> Amex Rule 915: Criteria for Underlying Stocks; CBOE Rule 5.3:Approval of Underlying Securities; and Phlx Rule 1009.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
