Drexel is much better known, of course, for helping companies issue debt in the form of high-yield, &quot;junk&quot; bonds.    But Drexel officials, including Michael R. Milken, who heads the firm's high-yield and convertible debt operation, have a new message. They are telling many clients that now is the time to replace bank debt and junk bonds with equity or convertible bonds, which can eventually become stock.    From a corporate treasurer's perspective, replacing debt with equity can give a company more financial flexibility by reducing interest charges. But this sort of switch has potential drawbacks for stockholders. &quot;If business improves, you've diluted some of that upturn&quot; among more equity holders, says Peter Sacerdote, the partner in charge of corporate finance at Goldman Sachs.    Drexel's argument, though, is aimed mainly at corporate clients. &quot;With equities trading at new highs and with some convertible bonds being issued with coupons only one half as high . . . as high-yield bonds, the latter don't have as much appeal,&quot; says the Drexel newsletter.    That message is being repeated around Wall Street and the business community. &quot;This is an ideal opportunity,&quot; to replace debt with equity, says Jerry Jordan, chief economist for First Interstate Bancorp, a Los Angeles-based bank holding company.    Among the companies that have acted so far this year are Occidental Petroleum, which sold over $1 billion in stock to primarily retire debt and Fruit of the Loom, a highly leveraged private company that recently sold $279 million in stock to buy back debt and preferred stock. In recent months, other big equity sales to help repurchase debt have been done by Valero Energy and Navistar.    Barry Friedberg, director of investment banking for Merrill Lynch says the equity underwritings by his firm rose 68% to nearly $2.2 billion in the first quarter from the year-earlier period. &quot;Most of the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding debt,&quot; he says.    Drexel says that in 1986 roughly $15 billion in high-yield debt was retired, up from less than $2 billion in 1985. Much of last year's total was funded by the sale of stock and convertible debentures. The rest came from the sale of assets, internal cash generation and lower interest-rate straight debt, the firm says.    A Drexel spokesman adds that as many as 30% of its several hundred high-yield debt clients are in a position to replace debt with equity or convertible debt.    Prime corporate prospects, investment bankers say, are companies that took on debt to make big acquisitions, to go private through a leveraged buyout or to fend off a hostile takeover bid. In the last category is Union Carbide, which took on over $2.5 billion in debt last year to defeat a takeover effort by GAF. In recent months, Union Carbide sold more than $650 million in stock and nearly $300 million in convertible debentures to replace some of that debt.    Selling large amounts of equity could depress the stock price, though that's less of a worry in a bull market. For instance, Union Carbide sold 30 million shares at 22 1/2 each and increased the shares outstanding 30%. The stock closed yesterday at 30.    So far, replacing debt with equity hasn't had an impact on the overall corporate debt load, which has been growing at a brisk pace. However, Drexel estimates the high-yield bond market will grow about 15% to 20% this year compared with 50% last year. Part of that slowed growth is due to increasing debt retirements, says a Drexel spokesman.    There are some obstacles to replacing debt with equity. For one thing, bonds typically have provisions that protect holders from having their securities redeemed for a certain period. With current interest rates generally much lower than the coupons carried on the debt, many holders would be reluctant to sell their bonds without getting a fat premium.    Several companies also have made direct swaps of equity for debt. In those cases, the debt holder must determine whether the potential return on the company's stock is greater than the interest rate on the bond.    Optimism by corporate executives can be another obstacle. &quot;A fellow optimistic enough to leverage his balance sheet may be optimistic enough to think the stock market will keep going up until further notice,&quot; says James Grant, editor of a financial newsletter.    However, Mr. Grant, a frequent critic of junk bonds and the rising level of corporate debt, wishes Mr. Milken nothing but the best in efforts to push equity.    For such firms as Drexel, it is also a business opportunity. The high-yield debt market, which Drexel effectively created and dominates, is becoming much more competitive as other investment bankers and banks compete for a chunk of the business.    Mr. Milken, who declined to be interviewed, hasn't soured on high-yield bonds and still believes the overall level of corporate debt is still relatively low, say Drexel officials. Advocating equities is &quot;just a reflection of market conditions,&quot; says the Drexel spokesman. </TEXT></DOC>
