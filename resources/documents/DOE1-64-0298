<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0298 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new 2.0-T high-speed MR imaging system (Advanced NMR System, Inc., Woburn,Mass.) that permits acquisition of a complete image in 40 msec has becomeavailable. The images are acquired within a 26-msec acquisition windowplaced under the signal envelope of a conventional spin-echo pulse sequence.The resulting images are acquired on a 64 X 128 image matrix. Becauseof the extremely short image acquisition time, a complete cardiac motionstudy can be performed in a single suspended respiration, with virtualelimination of cardiac and respiratory motion artifacts. Preliminarystudies show clear demonstration of major cardiovascular structures,including left and right ventricular walls. The system should lend itselfto cardiac function studies.</TEXT></DOC>
