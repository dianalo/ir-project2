<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-65-0819 </DOCNO><TEXT>A measurement method is described for determining the flow of vibrationpower in laboratory conductor spans. The vibration amplitude and thedynamic slope of the conductor are sensed at an arbitrary spanwise location.Their signals are manipulated by an analog computer to produce voltagesthat represent independently the travelling waves that convey vibrationpower forward and backward along the span. Power flow may be calculatedfrom the amplitudes of these waves. The method affords a more favorablecombination of accuracy and speed of testing than previous methods.</TEXT></DOC>
