The method is basedupon densitometry of ribless parts of the lung with subsequent digitalprocessing of the obtained data using the spectral analysis and the Fouriertransform. the algorithm DW permits dividing all films into 2 classes:''normal'' and ''pathology''. The accuracy of diagnosis of normal caseswas 80%, that of diagnosis of pathology - 90%.</TEXT></DOC>
