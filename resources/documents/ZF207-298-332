(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Pack your bagsandM;Auto Route Plus is an interactive software mapping and geographic informationsystem designed to simplify tasks of route planning and route scheduling.andO;Gone are the days of purchasing large quantities of road and country maps.andO;AutoRoute Plus helps eliminate those costs by providing a complete system forroute planning and scheduling.andM;The package will plan your routes anywhere in Britain.andP;  It allows you to pickyour own starting and finishing points, find the best route possible fortravel between two and 25 places, then optimizes the route, avoiding the busytown centres, roadworks and contraflows, incorporates your preferences forspeed limits and different types or class of roads, such as motorways, dualcarriageways, A or B roads etc.andP;  Then, within seconds, it calculates thequickest, shortest and cheapest journeys you can make, using mileage, timerates, time of day, and vehicle type as the basis for its calculations.andP;  Theresult is a whopping 20 to 30 per cent saving in driving time, operatingcosts, wasted man hours and aggravation.andM;AutoRoute Plus contains a huge databank of 33,000 place names and covers morethan 67,000 miles of road.andP;  With the optional post code module, access isavailable to over 8,700 postal codes, thus providing more accurate routeplanning and scheduling.andM;Having the postcode module means you don't even have to know how to spell thetown name; you only need know the post code - an excellent feature.andP;  Apostcode is a combination of up to seven alphabetical and numericalcharacters which define four different aspects of location.andP;  In the UnitedKingdom there are: 120 postcode areas (eg TW) 2,700 postcode districts (egTW18) 8,900 postcode sectors (eg TW18 4) and 1,300,000 postcodes (eg TW184XE).andM;A postcode add-on module is available which includes all postcode sectorsoutside Northern Ireland.andP;  These can be used to pinpoint your offices,warehouses, customers, dealers, salesmen or even friends within individualdistricts of any town or city.andM;Notably the greatest feature of AutoRoute is its ability to display fullcolour maps on screen.andP;  AutoRoute Plus is based on the latest OrdinanceSurvey data of 67,000 miles of mapped motorways, A, B, and minor roads aswell as most ferries and over 33,000 place names.andP;  road numbers and placenames shown may be selectively added or removed to produce the most usefulmap for your purposes.andM;For closer checking of a complex region, you have the ability to zoom in on aspecific area of the map.andP;  Using the Gazetteer option module editor (ageographical database index) AutoRoute allows the user to create Gazetteers(overlays of information) showing the location of all their offices, shops,dealers, competitors, distribution networks, freight depots, pubs,restaurants, airports and other special places.andM;AutoRoute Plus can accept up to ten gazetteers containing additional placenames or features.andP;  It's supplied with two -- one containing nearly everyvillage in Great Britain, the other containing mountains, rivers and othernatural features.andM;Automatic direction sensing (ADS) is an integral feature of the software.andO;Once the journey has been planned and calculated, the full drivinginstructions on how to drive from where you are to where you wish to be maybe followed (eg At Hyde Park Corner, turn right onto the A1 heading northeast for one mile towards Picadilly Circus, at the corner marked ...andP;  turnleft ...).andP;  So not only do you have a custom map, you also have explicitdirections on how to get where you want to be, using the most direct andefficient, cost effective route.andP;  What could be simpler?andM;There are a number of applications for which autoRoute Plus is ideallysuited.andP;  One is tourism.andP;  With its built-in search facility, AutoRoute Plusis a nationwide touring guide.andP;  Databases of hotels, garages, historicallandmarks, unique pubs and ale house can all be shown as overlays to thebasic AutoRoute system, along with other vital information, such as phonenumbers, opening and closing times, directions of how to get there from amain road, etc.andM;The same concept could also hold true for computer maintenance firms.andP;  Thequickest route to any customer can be calculated and printed to quicken thefield service response time for hardware breakdowns.andM;In terms of geographical information management, AutoRoute should be anessential tool to many business plans, from sales and marketing through toexpansion and relocation.andP;  AutoRoute Plus transforms dry, textual informationinto colour graphics.andP;  I have only two complaints.andP;  The first is that theproduct is copy protected.andP;  Installing it onto the hard disk wipes theprogram from the floppy disks until the program is de-installed, which is amajor nuisance.andP;  The second is the price has been more than doubled from the130 pounds sterling of AutoRoute v1.1.andP;  However, given the scope of theprogram, 299 pounds sterling is still good value.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
