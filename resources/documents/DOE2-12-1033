Common lorehas it that these neutrinos, because of their weak coupling to matter,pass through all but the iron core and inner silicon shell of the collapsingstar with negligible interaction. So far as energy deposition and theexplosion mechanism go, this is true but for the nuclear chemistry ofthe star, we argue that it is not. We draw particular attention to thesynthesis of an element whose origin has hitherto been obscure - fluorine- and show that its solar abundance constrains the temperature of muonand tauon neutrinos to values near what is expected from the standardmodel (8-10 MeV).</TEXT></DOC>
