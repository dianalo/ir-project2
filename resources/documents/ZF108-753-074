 Once introduced, symbol systems and thenecessary hardware and software were rapidly created to store and manipulatedata from any source in machine-readable form.andP;  With this development camethe ability to exchange data files or add to them by telecommunicationmachines.andP;  One consequences of this development is that it is now feasiblefor scientists to share research data on a scale never before envisioned.andM;While it has always been possible for consenting scientists to collaborateand work with and on each others' data, actually to do so was extremelylaborious.andP;  Computer-based processing technology of machine-readable data nowmakes it possible for groups of scientists sharing a common interest in adata file to work on or otherwise analyze and reanalyze each others' data.andO;Of course, different types of data are used and different scientific methodsare employed depending on the type of investigation being conducted.andO;However, once coded, the technical conditions for sharing data are fulfilled.andO;These technical potentials are made practical because, as a furtherconsequence of the automation of scientific data processing, scientistsworking with computers are forced to store and document data in an extremelyprecise fashion.andP;  Each data item placed on machine-readable media must beclearly defined, and recorded according to precise protocol in order to takeadvantage of data-processing techniques.andP;  However, once data in a file hasbeen clearly defined, most practical obstacles are removed, allowingindividuals other than the original investigators to handle that data.andP;  Infact, a great deal of data handling may be done by programmers, who are notscientists themselves.andP;  Indeed, it may be immaterial for the mechanics ofprocessing scientific data (but not necessarily for its quality) if theindividual directing the analysis is an original investigator or a recipientof data created by the original investigator.andP;  (1)andM;The technical ability of freely making use of already existing data stored onmachine-readable media is new in the sense that it is practical to do.andO;However, its use and growth have not been without conflict.andP;  While conditionsexist that encourage data sharing, very often forces appear to be at workthat oppose the sharing of data.andM;A number of forces--both implicitly or explicitly--initiate changes intechnology, impelling a shift away from modes which have until nowcharacterized the conduct and communication of science and scientists.andM;Other forces arise from certain strong economic, psychological and politicalfactors that guide most contact modes of scientists (and others).andP;  A numberof these factors tend to select from among the available technologies, thosesupporting dominant economic and political interests, often resulting inconflicts between diverging scintific interests.andP;  These motivating forcesaptly have been called reinforcement politics [9].andM;Of course, neither accommodation nor conflict need rule the roost.andP;  Theimpact modern technology has on the conduct of scientists depends oncircumstances.andP;  Certainly, the idea that technology represents a single forcefor sharing while social and economic forces represent a counterforce issimplistic.andP;  There are general and contradictory impulses whose resolutionsdiffer, depending on circumstances.andP;  Sometimes the impact of technology maydominate; at other times the impact of reinforcing politics and economics maydominate; and sometimes the model may be mixed--with elements of both aspectsintruding.andP;  We shall attempt to concentrate our discussion on those factorswhich support accommodation and those which may lead to conflict.andM;In Support ofandM;Accommodation:andM;The Easing of DataandM;SharingandM;Many examples of data sharing across sciences predate modern computingtechnology, or at best have used only primitive computing technology.andP;  Whilethese activities have increased greatly, other data-sharing activities havebeen added.andM;There appear to to be three types of data sharing:andM;1.andP;  Recipients have access to a system through which they can make queriesconcerning a central file containing a large body of orderly, cataloguedinformation, but since they lack direct access to that information theycannot modify it.andM;2.andP;  A copy of the data is transmitted from the Originator to Recipients.andO;While the Recipients process the original data independently, they maycommunicate with each other in the course of their work.andP;  They basicallyexploit the same data--but in their own ways.andM;3.andP;  Recipients have access to a central data file to which they maycontribute as well.andM;The use of data banks containing references of scientific literature (such asMEDLINE, TOXLINE, CANCERLIT, etc.) is the most common example of a centraldata file which scientists may query without, however, being able to accessits raw data directly or enter data of their own.andP;  These data banks functionas very extensive catalogues.andP;  The user accesses them, employing a particularlanguage (or instruction set) in which requests are made.andP;  Relatively simpleprograms then sort and search through files of categorized information.andP;  Asearch through a catalogue of published materials typically yields titles,authors' names, abstracts, keywords, and list of references corresponding tothe demand of the inquiry and so on.andP;  The usefulness of data banks ofpublished material is attested to not only by the large number of such filesin existence, but also by the creation of special commercial systems such asDIALOG, which can address and search through a large number of bibliographicreference files.andP;  These systems are extremely useful but they are not reallyexamples of the sharing of research data.andM;Then there are large data sets or data aggregates which are the results ofeither shared efforts by many scientists to develop a useful database, orsurveys (usually government sponsored or executed) in which large numbers ofobservations are made on a large population.andP;  The former exemplifies thetypes of data files available to natural history museums.andP;  These are fileswhich have been collected by many individuals over long periods of time or byteams of physicists, astronomers, and atmospheric scientists.andP;  Socialscientists have collaborated in building data sets used by many.andO;Anthropology's Human Relations Are Files (HRAF) and sociology's ChicagoCommunity Fact Book (CCFB) are well-known examples of this type.andP;  The manysurveys implemented throught the U.S.andP;  Census, especially through theNational Center for Health Statistics are examples of the latter type.andP;  Ofinterest here, however, is how investigators are permitted to interact withthese data banks.andM;Allowing other investigators to analyze body of research data such asexperimental results or the responses to a survey can be done in two ways.andO;One is simply to grant the investigator read-only access to the data,allowing him to perform any desired analysis using standard packages such asBMD or SPSS.andP;  One can impose further limitations, and grant read-only accessthrough certain programs such as BMD or SPSS.andP;  For example, we allow otherinvestigators to use one of our databases, the Building Performance Database(BPD), only through the Multiple Attribute Retrieval System (MARS)[20].andP;  Theother possibility is to allow access only through a special statisticalpackage that limits queries to statistical questions about large subsets ofthe data in a way that privacy or confidentiality cannot be breached.andP;  Suchsystems are known as statistical databases.andM;It is true that there is a great deal of literature on the theory andproblems of statistical databases.andP;  Many authors suggest these systems wouldbe useful for databases containing census information, medical records, orresults of surveys which contain sensitive information whose privacy must beensured.andP;  However, we were unable to find any references to actualimplementations, or to a body of data which can actually be queried, usingsuch a statistical database system.andP;  (2)andM;Public Use Tapes obtainable from such agencies as the U.S.andP;  Census Bureau orthe National Center for Health Statistics serve as examples of data fileswhich can be made available in toto.andP;  These public use files contain dataresulting from various activities by the data-collecting agency.andP;  Data thatare made available are purged of sensitive information, particularly itemsthat could identify informants.andP;  Public Use Tapes may also containintermediate variables besides the original data created by the originatingdata-collecting agency.andP;  The public use files are usually well documentedbecause their data have already undergone extensive processing.andM;New material may be added to a public use file in two ways.andP;  The originatingagency may announce that it has a modified Public Use Tape available or,under certain circumstances, an individual investigator may requestadditional information be added for a particular analysis.andP;  Ib the additionaldata can only be merged with the original data by using information that isdeemed to be confidential, the investigator may have to send a tapecontaining the additional data needed for the analysis and have theoriginating agency provide a tape containing the neede data, or perhaps evenanalyze the sensitive data and inform the collaborating investigator ofresults.andP;  While we are not concerning ourselves with the issue ofconfidentiality in detail here, we need to acknowledge that there are seriousissues concerning confidentiality with statistical data-bases.andP;  For instance,the U.S.andP;  government has mined census data to locate families of JapaneseAmericans for internment during World War II [14].andM;One great advantage of possessing a copy of the data file is the intensitywith which analysis may be carried out.andP;  Conducting extensive analysis oflarge data files in costly and, despite decreased transmission costs, isstill best performed locally.andP;  Large data aggregates, such as those compiledby the U.S.andP;  Census Bureau or the National Center for Health Statistics,provide useful data for answeing a large number of factual questions and fortesting different hypotheses.andP;  Indeed, hundreds of papers published inscientific journals are based on the analyis of these Public Use Tapes.andO;Investigators who have special problems may obtain additional related datafiles and combine these in a linked arrangement.andP;  Such linked arrangementsmay enlarge the reah of scientific analysis significantly.andP;  For instance, itmay be possible to combine hospital records containing diagnosis, date ofentry, and discharge of patients with information about pollutant levelsduring the same periods obtainable from the Air Pollution Network for thepurpose of evaluating the health effects of air pollution.andP;  [23,25].andP;  Thistype of analysis between linked data files is not practical unless aninvestigator controls all files to be linked.andM;It is important to emphasize, however, that none of the examples we havecited here represents a true interactive data-gathering and analyzing effort.andM;We do not know of an example of a publicly described system which permits adegree of interactive input, management, and transformation of a body ofresearch data comparable to that commonly found in inventory systems orairline reservation systems.andP;  There are instances in which data aggregatesare assembled by collaborating investigators.andP;  However, at present, inputcapabilities are not usually passed on to collaborators.andP;  input is almostalways centrally handled.andP;  Again, we emphasize we are missing examples ofcollaborations in which responsibility for input as well as ongoing analysisis shared by independent groups of investigators.andM;Technical ProblemsandM;in Implementing AccessandM;Experience with existing types of shared systems does not indicateinsurmountable obstacles to full data sharing.andP;  But obstacles do exist:Sharing data systems cannot be carried out unless an inquirer is highlyqualified professionally and acquires neede skills or receives assistance forcommunicating with the software.andP;  Another obstacle is cost.andM;The degree of computer literacy required by data processors, especially thosewho analyze large data files assembled at installations other than their own,is usually grossly underestimated.andP;  Languages that allow effectivemanipulation of complex databases are necessarily complex.andP;  To some extent,an illusion of ease of extracting data is created by the type of informationsystem that provides a prepackaged display--usually in response to pressing akey.andP;  However, this type of menu-driven informaton system is more akin to asophisticated set of catalogues than to the analysis of data archives for thelarge variety of questions constituting scientific inquiry.andM;To analyze an archive that contains data in some complex structure requiresthe capability to group, sort, convert, and rearrange data.andP;  (This is quitedistinct from the understanding that the new and hopeful user must have aboutthe meaning and usefulness of the variables that are contained in thatarchive.)andP;  The user must be offered an extensive data dictionary (usuallyidentifying subfiles and individual data items by acronyms) and a set ofinstructions (i.e.andP;  a language) with which data in the archive may beselected and manipulated.andP;  Often analytic programs for making tables, testingfor statistical independence, performing multivariate analyses such asregression, log linear analysis, or non-linear regression or various types ofgraphing are part of the manipulation package that provides the instructonsets to invoke special mathematical procedures.andM;However, a good manipulating language, one that can effectively provide theuser with many different services in data manipulation, requires time andeffort to learn.andP;  The more useful the instruction set, and the more servicesare made available through such a database-manipulating language, the morecomplex the grammar of such a language gets to be.andP;  Commands for datamanipulations are further complicated because they need to contain names ofdata entities.andP;  The data is usually structured in some relational scheme andorganized in a dictionary of data names, often containing many hundreds ofentries.andP;  Thus, the manipulator not only must know the language, but alsomust be familiar with the data dictionary (unless names of data entities areto be looked up in the dictionary each time they are needed--a lengthyprocedure).andP;  Manipulative commands must be carefully entered because of themany data names and labels involved and a single typographical error in astring of statements may prevent processing orproduce erroneous results.andO;Therefore, a good data management language provides for storing of chains ofcommands and their modification via an editing subsystem.andP;  However, thatuseful service also enlarges the set of instructions.andP;  Thus, an adequateinstruction set is simultaneously extensive, requiring learning and practiceand sometimes considerably greater time commitment on the part of the userthan a busy investigator may be willing to assume.andM;Extensive service programs also are embedded within the larger operatingsystem that regulates the activity of the total computer facility.andP;  Theoperating system usually does not present an obstacle to the simpleextraction of data.andP;  However, scientists who wish to also perform furtheranalyses on extracted data are forced to learn the idiosyncrasies of aparticular operating system.andP;  For instance, all our databases depend onsoftware written for a facility that uses the Michigan Terminal System (MTS).andO;But this dependence on MTS creates severe difficulties for interactiveprocessing with other facilities which do not operate under the system.andO;There are a limited number of installations that use MTS, which complicatesinteractive sharing greatly.andP;  (3)  A scientist may have considerabledifficulty finding skilled help in the university computing facility forinteractive work with an operating system not in use at the scientist'sinstitution.andM;There are optimistic projections that many of these detailed and laboriousmanipulations will be relieved by the development of better natural languageimplementation systems or by information handling expert systems.andP;  Whethersuch projections are overly optimistic pipe dreams or whether they wait forgreat breakthroughs in software, the fact is that these expert systems ornatural languages that would relieve search-through files of the tyedescribed do not yet exist or exist only as trivialized models.andP;  For themoment, we need to acknowledge that the useful manipulation of complex andextensive data files also requires complext and extensive software and thehelp of individuals who are skilled in manipulating that software.andM;One other obstacle not yet faced by collaborating scientists concerns theability of dispersed collaborators to input information into a centraldatabase, especially if the new data was obtained by processing alreadystored data.andP;  These types of problems can present serious difficulties incommercial applications.andP;  For instance, a number of terminal-usingreservation clerks may seek to allocate the same seats, at the same time, fordifferent customers in an airline reservation system.andP;  No really goodpractical solutions have been found for scientific systems that would permitcollaborative input.andP;  Although this problem has practical and relativelyefficient solutions for the situations that arise in commercial applications,it may be considerably more difficult to deal with in general in scientificresearch databases due to th more open-ended nature of the problem.andM;Both distance and speed of transmission create cost problems.andP;  To a largeextent these problems have been solved by networks of communication channels.andO;These channels make it possible for a user in a remote location to connectwith a local exchange and pay only costs of actual traasmission (which isjust a small fraction of the length of time spent on a terminal in aninteractive process).andP;  Transmission costs can be eliminated entirely bysending data tapes or data streams to a collaborator.andP;  Recipients then workindependently on their data files and exchange modifications or informationas needed.andP;  Use of telecommunications networks is generally reserved forinstances where the cost of creating and maintaining a large but often useddata file is distributed among users.andM;However, we cannot discount the cost of creating (and sharing) large dataaggregates.andP;  Lack of adequate funds places an obvious limitation on theexploitation of available technology.andP;  For instance, the Canadian HeritageInventory Network (CHIN) will eventually obtain descriptive information andthe location of archeological sites, historic sites, treasures, paintings,and other artifacts in Canada.andP;  (In fact, many municipal and provincial artgalleries have access to CHIN through hard-wired terminals.)andP;  However, atthis time only the inventory of paintings and other treasures is completeenough to support scholarly research.andP;  Similarly, the SouthwesternArcheological Research Group failed to establish a data bank because thefunds were not forthcoming to support the categorization of massivearcheological data in the American Southwest.andP;  But, it may be expected thatthe encoding of all relevant scientific data will proceed, albeit slower forsome disciplines than for others.andM;In Support of Conflict:andM;The Politics of SharingandM;Sharing of data has been an issue in science ever since creation of knowledgehas been a human enterprise.andP;  Due to technical progress, giving scientiststhe ability to share data, this issue and the conflict surrounding it hasbeen sharpened to the point that it might be an entirely new or greatlyescalated problem.andP;  Simplistically looked at, the scientist whose cabinetabounds with sheaths of paper on which data is scribbled could easily hidebehind the technical problems of re-recording in an orderly fashion datawhich someone else wants to share, if he did not wish to share it.andP;  Thehigh-sounding principle to which all scientists pay obeisance, that scienceand its data are public, is not always honored in practice.andP;  The ability ofscientist A to link to scientist B's data is influenced by a large number ofeconomic, social, psychological and political factors which will likelycontinue to determine the willingness or unwillingness of one scientist togive another scientist access to his data.andM;Statistics on how often access to data is demanded or refused are hard tocome by.andP;  There is no public scorekeeper who tallies how often access to datais requested, how often it is granted, and how often it is refused.andO;Knowledge of incidents of refused data sharing is largely anecdotal.andM;Leon Kamin reports refusal of access to data in studies which were at oddswith the scientific literature on the generic basis of schizophrenia [13].andO;Access to data was first refused by investigators on the grounds thatdivulging the data about their subjects would not be in line with thecondition under which information from subjects had been solicited.andP;  WhenKamin pointed out that subject identities could be protected, theinvestigators refused access because they had not finished analyzing theirdata.andP;  These same excuses were offered by th American Cancer Society when acommittee of 10 senior scientists requested access to the data of amillion-person epidemiological study on the effects of smoking.andO;Subsequently, this refusal led to an exchange of letters in Science magazineand, indirectly, to a conference called by the National Institutes of Health[1, 21, 22].andP;  The National Cancer Institute was concerned about when torelease data, and being forced to share information on findings which relatedto possible carcinogenic properties of commonly used substances, orsubstances which were to be introduced into common use.andM;Ceci and Walker surveyed 790 researchers from a variety of physical andsocial sciences [5].andP;  The survey was not meant to be a random selection ofscientists, but they did compare groups of investigators, such asbiotechnologists who stood to reap large rewards from certain findings, withsocial scientists who were not likely to participate in a reward structure tothe same degree.andP;  Ceci and Walker found few significant differences inopinion among scientists from various fields.andP;  The rate of refusal to sharedata ranged from 16 to 20 percent.andP;  However, there are indications that thepercent of refusal may be higher in actual practice.andP;  In a second survey,which on the whole replicated the results of the first, Ceci and Walker askedscientists to describe their own experiences in trying to obtain data fromcolleagues or to comment on their associates' attitudes regarding datasharing.andP;  The majority reported that thier colleagues were not prone tosharing data, even when it was obtained with benefit of federal funds.andP;  [4]andM;There appear to be five major reasons for the underlying lack of enthusiasmto share data:andM;1.andP;  Potential loss of reward (monetary, political or psychological)andM;2.andP;  Potential conflict and disagreementandM;3.andP;  Potential exposure of extreme bias and fraudandM;4.andP;  Lack of incentive to use someone else's data even though that data mightbe usefulandM;5.andP;  Exchange of scientific research data which has international characterbut may be restricted because it is considered too sensitive for an exchangebetween nationsandM;Possession of data my have financial and personal rewards.andP;  There is a childresearch institute in San Francisco that inherited the original contactinformation about a large cohort of children and is following them as theygrow older.andP;  The cohort consists of a large sample of children whose parents'various lifestyle factors were determined at birth.andP;  For years that institutewas the sole possessor of this data which was used to justify long years ofsupport by the National Institutes of Health for follow-up studies.andP;  Theresearch group refused all requests for parting with any of its data.andP;  WhenAnna Freud gave Masson access to Freud's letters she set up a situation whichnot only enabled Masson to become a leading spokesman for a particular schoolof interpretation of the causes of hysteria, but also offered Masson theopportunity to write a bestselling book (serialized in the New Yorker beforepublication) [16].andP;  Ceci points out the ample rewards to biotechnologistsfrom many discoveries.andP;  Certainly, engineers have mightily prospered (andmore so the companies for which they work) from discoveries, many of whichwere supported by public funds.andM;A second and very important source of resistance to data sharing is theexpectation of disagreement and conflict.andP;  Data are very often requested inthe course of adversary processes before regulating agency hearings, specialcommissions, administrative law judges and civil litigations (sometimes theseadversary processes involve all four).andP;  One example is a recent study of thehealth effects of formaldehyde on an industrial population by the U.S.andO;National Cancer Institute (NCI) [2].andP;  The Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) has been concerned that the current industrialformaldehyde standard might be too high.andP;  Industry strongly denies there arefindings of health effects possibly associated with exposure to formaldehydeat presently acceptable levels.andP;  For reasons difficult to understand, the NCIstudy was done jointly with The Formaldehyde Institute (an industry lobby)and a number of major formaldehyde-producing and/or using industries.andO;Perhaps because of industry participation, the reported results appeared togive a clean bill of health to industry.andM;The study design, conduct and conclusions were severely critized byenvironmental and occupational scientists and labor unions during the 1986OSHA hearings.andP;  Simultaneously, the NCI study's conclusions were mostrelevant to a class action suit brought against producers and the governmentof Canada by residents of Quebec whose homes had been insulated with ureaformaldehyde foam insulation by a federally subsidized program.andP;  With supportprovided by L'Office de Protection du Consommateour of the Province ofQuebec, the original data for this study were requested from the NCI andreanalyzed.andP;  It turns out that, where the NCI study did not conclude therewas a significant association with lung cancer, a different categorizationnof the data and a more thorough control for confounding variables yields theopposite--namely, a significant dose-dependent increased risk for lung cancerfor the industrial cohort study [26].andP;  This finding resulted in the reopeningof OSHA hearings [11].andP;  Thus, access to the NCI data had far-reachingresults.andP;  This incident is far from isolated.andP;  In another example, a reviewof the U.S.andP;  Veterans study and reanalysis of its data found errors ofprogramming that had led to misclassification of 50,000 out of 250,000subjects [24].andM;One problem that fuels the fear of conflict and disagreement is thepossibility of using the same data to obtain different sets of results.andP;  Datacan be manipulated, subsamples of data emphasized, other subsamplesneglected, in such a way that not one, but a number of different conclusionscan be based on the same data.andP;  As the amount of data increases,opportunities to manipulate it also increase.andP;  Thus, access to a particulardata assembly of a largescale scady is of considerable interest toadversaries where there is conflict between different interests.andM;A third motive for withholding data is the existence of bias, especially ofbias bordering on fraud, if not of fraud itself [3].andP;  Many scientists take anactivist role in various issues and some may use their position andacknowledged expertise to present findings that are relevant to a contentiouspublic issue.andP;  But sometimes conclusions publicized by scientists who alsoplay a role as advocates, rest on stubborn belief rather than acceptableanalysis of data.andP;  There may be a wide difference between conclusionsactually supported by the data and those published by the author.andP;  While somescientists may justify their biased presentations by their fervent belief inthe justice of their cause, they still find it prudent to refuse access totheir real findings.andP;  Then, of course, there are instances of outrightscientific fraud.andP;  It is unlikely that data manufactured to support afraudulent claim is shared (or of any relevance).andM;A Final WordandM;Many of the issues we touched upon here are discussed by sociologists andhistorians of science [6, 7, 8, 15, 17, 18].andP;  It cannot be denied thatscientists have shared resources by the use of electronic networks [10, 19].andO;Hitz [12] has summarized the services which have been created to helpacademic research.andP;  These services include (in order of apparent usefulnessas ranked by Hiltz) private messages, text editing, user consultants, systemcommands, group references, group messages, directories, private conferences,retrievals, searches, user-defined commands, anonymity or pen names,synchronous discussions, graphics routines, and examples of voting.andP;  However,we must emphasize they do not show examples of actual sharing, analyzing andrearranging of data.andP;  What we suggest here is that such current activities donot take place without some possible conflict and that the conflict is at itsgreatest where science is at its most creative.andP;  Data can be stored in amachine-readable form and modern telecommunications systems make it possiblefor many scientists to gain access to these data.andP;  There are technicalproblems, some of which have been and some of which need to be resolved togive full access to the stored information.andP;  But these technical obstacles donot appear to be insurmountable.andP;  Providing that all the technicalprerequisites are met, modern telecommunications technology, combined withadvances in computing, facilitates sharing of data so that sharing becomespractical and inexpensive.andP;  Data sharing also is seriously advocated as adesirable extension of scientific conduct [28].andM;At the same time, the potential facilitation of data sharing impinges onareas of scientific activity which have been marked more by conflict than bycooperation.andM;One reasonable conclusion from our brief review is that politics andeconomics of interaction of scientists would tend to encourage some anddiscourage other uses of the technology for different aspects of datasharing.andM;A number of aspects of data sharing have proven to be useful and acceptable,and they will continue to flourish.andP;  Foremost among them are two:andM;1.andP;  The use of large data files for reanalysis and exploration, such asCensus files or data sets of archaeological data, or Public Use Tapes ofNCHS.andM;2.andP;  The use of data aggregates that serve as very comprehensive catalogues,such as for literature search or collections of technical data as theBuilding Performance DataBase [9].andM;Scientist-to-scientist cooperation depends on individual arrangements.andP;  Onthe whole, however, the prospects for that particular cooperation to flourishare dim.andP;  Economic motives, motives of personal power, possible disagreement,prospects of conflict, likely detection of bias or fraud (and who among us isnot conscious of some aspects of bias and fraudulent exaggeration of theimportance of our work), all combine to discourage data sharing.andM;This does not mean that some data will not always be available for review byothers.andP;  Legislation, such as the Freedom of Information Act or orders from ajudge, might compel some scientists working for a public service organizationor engaging in expert testimony in a litigation to make their date availableto others.andP;  But the nature of the politics of data sharing wil discouragerather than encourage that activity.andM;(1) The terms primary and secondary investigator are sometimes used forOriginal and Recipient.andP;  However, we prefer to refer tod the original creatorof a data file as the originator and to others who work on the data asrecipients because in some cases there may be many, in fact hundred, ofrecipients.andM;(2) See J. Ullman [27] for discussion on statistical database systems.andM;(3) Some of the pressure to adopt generally used systems such as Apple,MS-DOS, OS/2 or UNIX is based on the experience of investigators trying tointerchange software and data between different users.andM;ReferencesandM;[1] Blade, E.
