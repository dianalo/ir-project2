Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> T WNEWS SUNW </CO><IN> TEL </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vittorio Cassoni, the man charged with turning around American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s disastrous venture into the computer business, abruptly announced that he will leave ATandamp;T next month for a top job at his old employer, Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. of Italy.    The news surprised ATandamp;T executives and added fresh turmoil to a company still reeling from the death last week of Chairman James Olson. It also cast new confusion over the increasingly tumultuous relationship between Olivetti and ATandamp;T, which owns a big stake in the Italian office-gear maker and distributes its personal computers in the U.S.    Succeeding Mr. Cassoni as president of ATandamp;T's Data Systems Group will be Robert Kavner, a 44-year-old accountant who is currently the telecommunications giant's chief financial officer. Mr. Kavner said yesterday he wants to shift ATandamp;T's emphasis away from manufacturing and toward the smaller but more lucrative arena of software and services. But he said he wouldn't take ATandamp;T out of manufacturing altogether, a retreat that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.    The management changes add a new twist to one of the most ill-starred sagas in industrial history. ATandamp;T's zeal to get into computers was one of the chief reasons it assented to its big breakup four years ago. It promised to transform itself from a phone company to a high-tech visionary that would shape the new business of moving voice and data over electronic networks.    Instead, ATandamp;T dug an enormous sinkhole of losses. In 1986 alone, the Data Systems Group piled up a pretax operating loss of $1.2 billion. Last year Mr. Cassoni cut that by 70%, though analysts say much of that was through reallocating overhead and other costs elsewhere within ATandamp;T.    Mr. Cassoni said he had planned to return to Olivetti ever since he joined ATandamp;T two years ago. He said the timing of his return had nothing to do with the tensions that erupted this month between ATandamp;T and Olivetti.    As previously reported, the two partners have been reexamining their ties, though each side has been telling a different story about the talks. Olivetti's chairman, the acquisition-hungry Carlo De Benedetti, has said he has been fighting off ATandamp;T's effort to seize more control of his company. ATandamp;T sources say Mr. De Benedetti wanted ATandamp;T to raise its stake to give him more cash for his battle to take over Societe Generale de Belgique.    It's not yet fully clear how the job-hop of Mr. Cassoni, a top De Benedetti lieutenant, fits into the broader ATandamp;T/Olivetti tussle. Some European analysts said it presages a final parting of ways for the two companies. In another interpretation, it could also strengthen their relationship, since Mr. Cassoni will bring to his new post at Olivetti an intimate inside understanding of ATandamp;T's view of the world.    Mr. Kavner said he and Mr. Cassoni had discussed six months ago on a Florida golf course the possibility that the executive might depart and Mr. Kavner might replace him. Mr. Kavner also said his last conversation with the late Mr. Olson, about a month ago, was about the prospect of running ATandamp;T's computer business.    Nevertheless, yesterday's announcement caught ATandamp;T insiders off guard. Mr. Cassoni's top managers only learned of the change at a dinner meeting Sunday night where, Mr. Kavner said, &quot;I was the fellow that jumped out of the cake.&quot;    &quot;It's like Olson's death,&quot; said one ATandamp;T computer executive. &quot;You weren't prepared for it, therefore you don't know all the ramifications.&quot;    Both Mr. Kavner and the 45-year-old Mr. Cassoni said ATandamp;T and Olivetti don't plan to sever their ties. But they made it clear that the relationship is fluid and may undergo some changes.    &quot;There's no dogma,&quot; said Mr. Cassoni. &quot;We will exploit the synergies where there are synergies, and we won't impose synergies where there are none.&quot;    Mr. De Benedetti is said to be badly disappointed in ATandamp;T's performance distributing personal computers in the U.S., though he doesn't seem to have a good alternative channel. ATandamp;T has also been unhappy with Olivetti's side of the bargain, selling ATandamp;T minicomputers and phone gear in Europe.    Some frustrated analysts have said ATandamp;T would be better off if it stopped manufacturing computers altogether and concentrated on services and software -- especially its Unix operating system, which is gaining ground as a computer standard. Mr. Kavner yesterday indicated his interest in moving in that direction.    &quot;I don't have religion about manufacturing,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to keep an eye on where the margins are&quot; -- namely software and services. But he added, &quot;I don't want to leave the impression that the Kavner administration is going to turn this into a software house.&quot;    Mr. Kavner conceded that one of his first challenges will be to combat the perception that ATandamp;T's computer business without the charismatic Mr. Cassoni will be like the Tonight Show without Johnny Carson. &quot;There's this public impression that it's a one-man band, and we're going to have to prove that it isn't,&quot; he said.    Mr. Kavner will also succeed Mr. Cassoni as ATandamp;T's representative on the board of Sun Microsystems Inc., a Silicon Valley workstation maker. ATandamp;T has an agreement to buy 20% of Sun, its close partner in marketing Unix -- a deal Mr. Kavner helped put together.    Sun Chairman Scott McNealy said he hadn't been told in advance of Mr. Cassoni's move. But he said he thought &quot;all the elements of (Mr. Cassoni's strategy with Sun) were in place.&quot;    Sun's stock slipped 37.5 cents to $36.375 in active national over-the-counter trading yesterday, and some analysts attributed the dip to concern about Mr. Cassoni's departure from ATandamp;T. ATandamp;T's stock edged up 12.5 cents to $27.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Mr. Cassoni's formal title at Olivetti will be managing director, reporting to Mr. De Benedetti.    ATandamp;T said Morris Tanenbaum, vice chairman, will assume Mr. Kavner's duties as chief financial officer. The changes will be effective May 15.    ---   Laura Colby in Rome and Richard L.
