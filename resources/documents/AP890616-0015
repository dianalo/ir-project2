The country's 27-member Theater and Film Censorship Board bannedthe film last October. The panel cited a criminal law that forbidspractices offensive to the beliefs of any religious group.   The movie, adapted from a 1955 novel by Nikos Kazanthakis,touched off protests by Christian groups in the United States andEurope. Some Christians have been offended by Scorsese's portrayalof Jesus Christ as a human being with passions and weaknesses.   In reversing the ban Thursday, the five-judge panel said it was``not enough that the movie is likely to stir up opposition or evenoffense against a portion of those who choose to see it.''   Amnon Globus of Golan-Globus Cannon, the film's Israelidistributors who appealed the case to the Supreme Court, said itsdecision signaled ``the end of censorship'' in Israel.   ``The ones who have to judge whether a movie should be shown ornot is the public,'' said Globus.   He said the movie would be shown in Israel by next week, afterHebrew subtitles are completed.</TEXT></DOC>
