Not any more. Earlier this month itreversed its longstanding policy, and accepted the principleof sending boat people to holding camps in Vietnam, whetherthey want to go or not. The proposed camps would be run by aninternational agency such as the U.N. High Commissioner forRefugees.   The UNHCR already runs a voluntary repatriation program,which has resettled about 7,000 boat people in Vietnam sinceMarch 1989. And it has long urged Vietnamese to leave theircountry only under the Orderly Departure Program. Indeed,57,000 Vietnamese emigrated through the ODP last year. TheODP, however, is no alternative for those who fearretribution from the authorities.</LP><TEXT>   Take the case of Hoa, a former interpreter for the U.S.Army, who applied to emigrate under the ODP in early 1988.Shortly after he was given an ODP case number, localauthorities crossed his name off the household registrationlist, thus denying him access to rationed staples andrestricting his freedom of movement. He was forced to hideevery few days when officials searched his home for illegaloccupants. A non-person in his own country, Hoa decided toflee by boat instead of waiting for his ODP case to bedetermined.   The U.S. decision was welcomed here in Hong Kong, which isholding almost 60,000 boat people. The British colony haslong tried to deter new arrivals by incarcerating the boatpeople in squalid and overcrowed detention centers. But theVietnamese keep on coming. More than 10,000 have arrived inHong Kong so far this year, compared with 6,598 for all oflast year. Clearly, transferring people from Hong Kong campsto Vietnamese ones is no solution; it ignores the reasonspeople fled in the first place.   For two years I worked in Hong Kong's Whitehead DetentionCenter, population 24,000. I spoke with hundreds ofVietnamese desperate for help in obtaining refugee status.These people realize that only a small percentage will begranted refugee status and the chance to re-settle. Still,they prefer a bleak future in Hong Kong's detention centersto going back.   The boat people consider the refugeee-screening processbiased, cursory and a violation of internationally acceptedjudicial norms. Amnesty International and the LawyersCommittee for Human Rights agree. Asia Watch recentlydocumented the cases of individuals who had been persecutedfor their leadership in human-rights activities in Vietnam,yet as boat people in Hong Kong had been denied refugeestatus.   The camps' screening questionnaire is concerned with onlythe applicant's immediate family, while the bio-dataquestionnaires used by Vietnamese authorities in applicationsfor education and employment ask about family activities asfar back as the French colonial period, before 1954.Discrimination in employment and education is still the normfor individuals whose parents or grandparents were associatedwith the French, or with the Americans. More severe penaltiesare confiscation of property, forced movement to New EconomicZones, as well as denial of household registration andidentity cards.   Take the case of Nhuan, who was the leader of a Catholiccommunity in a small village in northern Vietnam. The localauthorities confiscated his prayer books and crucifixes. OnSept. 6, 1988, the village attempted to celebrate the pope'shonoring of 117 Vietnamese Catholic martyrs, but publicsecurity officials broke up the ceremony and Nhuan went intohiding. He fled to Hong Kong and does not want to return toVietnam, where other Catholic leaders have been sentenced to10-year prison terms for celebrating the same event. Hisclaim to refugee status was denied.   The boat people's second concern is that they do not trustthe UNHCR's assurances that they will return to Vietnam insafety if they accept voluntary resettlement. Illegaldeparture remains a crime in Vietnam; those who havedissented in the past, even if by escape, know they can neverbe fully reintegrated into a political structure thatcontinues to view them with suspicion.   As one told me, &quot;If I return to Vietnam I will be subjectto special surveillance by the authorities. My record willcarry the mention `political suspect' because of my stay inHong Kong. In my whole lifetime I, myself, as well as mychildren and grandchildren will not be allowed to take anyimportant jobs with the government or simply to have anemployment as any other citizen has.&quot;   There are alternatives to forced repatriation. First, theflaws in the refugee-status determination procedures can beaddressed. (It is only fair to note that there have beenimprovements.) It's also possible to work for substantivechanges within Vietnam, of which improvement in human rightsshould be a top priority; in the meantime, the U.S. and othercountries can step up re-settlement.   The U.S., Britain and Hong Kong should not be playing withthe lives of the Vietnamese boat people. Instead, they shouldbe listening to what the boat people are saying by theirunwillingness to return to their homeland.   ---   Ms. Gow is a former UNHCR field worker at a detentioncenter for boat people in Hong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
