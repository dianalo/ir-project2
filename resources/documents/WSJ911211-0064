It's that they waited until a week ago to doit.   One audit of the rogue international bank more than a yearago by Price Waterhouse yielded a confidential 83-page reportthat was recently reviewed by this newspaper. The report anddozens of interviews with people familiar with the scandalindicate that:</LP><TEXT>   -- Far from being a bank intended to help developingcountries, BCCI appears to have been, from the outset, a planto line the pockets of already-rich Persian Gulf financiers.   -- Much of the bank's troubled nonperforming loans wereextended to these wealthy investors, often with insufficientcollateral.   -- When the bank's friends didn't repay their loans, BCCIcovered up with a secret bank-within-the-bank that tookdeposits and used the money to make loan payments appearcurrent.   -- The bank struggled to keep regulators off-track bydeveloping a vast international network of politicalcontacts, led in the U.S. by Democratic icon Clark Clifford.In recent weeks, the directors of First American BanksharesInc. -- the Washington area bank headed by Mr. Clifford andsaid by regulators to be covertly controlled by BCCI -- eventried to hire former Federal Reserve Board Chairman PaulVolcker. First American wanted Mr. Volcker to act as trusteefor shares in the Washington bank owned by BCCI, but Mr.Volcker said he wasn't interested, according to attorneyMichael Bradfield, who spoke on his behalf.   It will take months, perhaps years, to sort out this mess,which regulators and investigators say may cost between $5billion and $15 billion. But the illegal self-dealing thatlay at the core of the bank could have become apparent longbefore last week's crackdown.   At the center of the scandal are 12 Arab sheiks and theirPakistani bank managers who allegedly plundered BCCI fortheir own purposes. They include bank founder Agha HasanAbedi and his protege Swaleh Naqvi, and their names have beenforwarded to Britain's Serious Fraud Office for criminalinvestigation.   Although a subsequent Price Waterhouse report completed inJune actually triggered last week's seizure of BCCI, theearlier report reviewed by the Journal provides the firstclear look at the troubles and sloppy operations that finallyprompted regulators to act.   An example is the case of Sheik Kamal Adham, the formerhead of Saudi intelligence, a shareholder in both BCCI andthe parent company of First American, and a friend of BCCIfounder Mr. Abedi. At the end of 1989, he had borrowed atotal of $313 million from the Luxembourg subsidiary of BCCI.According to the bank's records, some of those loans werebacked by unidentified &quot;properties in Saudi Arabia.&quot;   But what are these properties and what are they worth?Price Waterhouse found &quot;no valuations&quot; and worse, &quot;no legalbasis for this security,&quot; because mortgages aren'tnecessarily enforceable in that country.   After Price Waterhouse told the bank of its concern aboutMr. Adham's account in November 1989, the auditors wereassured that his loan balance would be held at the 1988level. But by the end of the year, it was $17 million overthe previous year's level, and investigators say it hascontinued to grow.   Then there is the mysterious case of loans to Mr. A.R.Khalil, which stopped being serviced in the mid-1980s.Nevertheless, total borrowings from BCCI by Mr. Khalilcontinued to grow to $150.3 million at the end of 1989.According to the audit report, there are &quot;no signed loanagreements, no correspondence with the customer, no net worthstatements or cash flow information&quot; to back up the loans.   This newspaper was unable to locate Mr. Khalil. A formerlawyer for BCCI says he has &quot;been advised by Mr. Naqvi thatno one at the bank has been able to contact Mr. Khalil since1987.&quot; U.S. investigators question whether Mr. Khalilactually exists.   Then there was the case in which BCCI shipped $13.9million to a numbered account in the Cayman Islands, with noname attached and no documentation at all to support theloan.   The Price Waterhouse report also details the elaborateroute through which the bank funneled its own money to FirstAmerican Bankshares Inc., the Washington-area bank headed byMr. Clifford and his younger partner Robert Altman. BCCIdoled out hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to variousassociates, who then used that money to purchase shares inFirst American's holding company, Credit andamp; Commerce AmericanHoldings N.V.   Among those who received BCCI loans secured by shares inthe holding company, according to Price Waterhouse, were theruler of the tiny Arab emirate of Fujeirah ($186 million),the ruler of the emirate of Ajman ($86 million), Sheik Adham($105 million) and the elusive Mr. Khalil. The rulers ofFujeirah and Ajman later told Price Waterhouse that theydisagreed with the auditors' valuations and conclusions.   The auditors expressed alarm over the bank's many loanssecured by the holding company stock, but to no avail. &quot;InMarch 1989, management represented that the group's exposureto {the holding company} would be reduced,&quot; the PriceWaterhouse report says, but &quot;in fact the outstanding balanceat Dec. 31 1989 is $150 million greater than that a yearpreviously, and two borrowers have rejected their loancommitments.&quot; Speaking on behalf of Messrs. Clifford andAltman, Washington lawyer Robert Bennett said of the peculiarfinancing arrangement: &quot;In no way did they undermine theintegrity of First American or the interests of itsdepositors.&quot;   The report finds, for example, that BCCI exercised &quot;noreal control&quot; over much of its lending. It details more than$2 billion in troubled loans that BCCI lent to its closecoterie of allies, including Sheik Adham, Saudi banker KhaledBin-Mahfouz, Saudi businessman Ghaith Pharaon, the Gokaltrading family from Pakistan, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid ofDubai and other minor Gulf potentates.   In most cases loans hadn't been serviced for months oreven years, and little or no effort had been made to collecton them. Rather, in some cases, money continued to be drawndown by the clique, which included many present and formershareholders in BCCI and in the parent company of Mr.Clifford's First American Bankshares Inc.   To raise money to fund these questionable loans and toplug holes in its balance sheets, BCCI frantically scrambledto raise deposits, some of which appear to have gone into asecret bank-within-the-bank and were never recorded on itsbooks. It began routinely to collect deposits fromtraffickers in drugs, traffickers in arms, tax evaders andothers seeking shelter from the law. Some customers, whosought to hide their funds, may never claim their moneydeposited in BCCI for fear of exposure and legal reprisals.   Among those who benefitted from the bank's loose lendingpractices were the Gulf shipping companies controlled bythree Pakistani brothers named Gokal. At the end of 1989, theGokal companies had loans totalling $405 million fromBCCIeven though the group's main holding company had totalassets of only $416 million.   Another beneficiary of BCCI's largesse was the SaudiArabian banking family of Bin-Mahfouz, which controls thatcountry's biggest bank -- National Commercial Bank (NCB). ThePrice Waterhouse audit says it had loans of $152.5 million atthe end of 1989. Of this, $146 million &quot;isn't supported by{documented} requests&quot; the audit complains. The report notesthat BCCI is also &quot;heavily exposed to the Mahfouz bank withplacements of $250 million due from it.&quot;   Some of the missing money was spent by the bank and itsallies on greasing the wheels in political towns. InWashington, for instance, hundreds of millions of dollarswere poured into what soon became the town's largest bankholding company, First American, with Messrs. Clifford andAltman as its politically adroit helmsmen. First Americanmanaged to evade the scrutiny of regulators, until theFederal Reserve earlier this year demanded that it severitself from its de facto parent.   There were huge fees to Washington law firms, anothersource of political influence. BCCI spent as much as $35million on its defense against money-laundering charges inTampa, according to a former top BCCI official and one of thebank's lawyers. Millions more went to Mr. Clifford's lawfirm. There were even big donations to ex-President JimmyCarter's foundation and favorite charities; large lobbyingfees in Georgia and straight bribes to the family of a formerpresident of Paraguay and to leaders of other Latin Americanand African countries, according to former bank officials.   Who suffered as a result of this global financialscheming? Depositors in places where BCCI had big retailnetworks, including Britain, Africa, Latin America and theMideast. (BCCI customers in the United States are not likelyto sustain losses because the bank could not accept depositshere.)   In Britain, about 60 U.K. local authorities, attracted byBCCI's high interest rates, are facing losses of up to 100million pounds, according to the Association of DistrictCouncils.   Asian businessmen in London are also feeling the bank'scollapse. Many of them preferred to bank with BCCI becauseits employees were often fluent in Asian languages.   Repercussions of the scandal are likely to continue formonths. Further Federal Reserve enforcement actions areexpected soon. Federal prosecutors in Washington on June 14issued a subpoena to BCCI's lawyers asking for documentsrelating to Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman.   And in Manhattan, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, whohas spearheaded the investigation of BCCI and First Americanfor close to two years, is expected to seek indictments ofmany people involved in the affair. Another of the four grandjuries looking into BCCI is expected to recommend action soonconcerning the bank's links with CenTrust Bank of Miami,Florida's costliest savings andamp; loan failure.   ---   Nicholas Bray in London contributed to this article.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          SHEIKH MOHAMED bin RASHID al-MAKTOUM of Dubai wasidentified in a July 15 article on the Bank of Credit andamp;Commerce International scandal, reflecting statements in aPrice Waterhouse report to the bank, as one of those who &quot;gotthe money,&quot; certain large loans from BCCI. Having sinceconducted an independent investigation on the matter, thisnewspaper is now satisfied that none of the loans referred toin the Price Waterhouse report were, in fact, made to SheikhMohamed.
