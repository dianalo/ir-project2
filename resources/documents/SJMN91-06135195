There also have been stories aboutcards being trimmed to remove signs of wear, and there always is the suspicionthat dealers use lowball prices to buy cards from customers and exorbitantlyprofitable ones when selling.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  USING UNIQUE SALES POLICIES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Collectors' Connection  </MEMO><TEXT>     But Wasserman, who owns Collector's Corner II on North Santa Cruz Avenue,is not defensive about this image of dealers as, well, as scum. He and hisstore manager, Dave Kendall, say it was their unhappy experiences as consumersthat inspired them to adopt selling policies they think are unique.;    Themost attention-catching policy is one-time pricing. When the store acquires anitem -- a single card, a set, whatever -- it is given a price that is neverraised. Any rookie card that was priced at $2 is still available at $2 whenthe new monthly price guide says it's now worth $10 (assuming that every onein stock wasn't sold as soon as it hit $5 in the guide).;    The suspiciousamong you can ask a couple of good questions:;    (check) It's just anotherscam, isn't it? Sure, it's one-time pricing -- for five of the 100 cards ofthat type. The others get their one-time pricing after the price goes up.;   (check) If it's over-graded on condition from the start, that negates thebargain for the collector, doesn't it? Big deal that it was priced once. Itwas priced too high at the start.;    Wasserman answered question No. 1 bysaying he prices everything he gets as he acquires it. He added that his proofis on display in the form of quantities of cards with the same price.;    Asfor question No. 2, I dropped by the store and spot checked one relativelyexpensive card -- a George Brett rookie &quot;mini&quot; card (part of a set of cardsmade in smaller size than regular cards). Sure enough, Wasserman and Kendallsaw it as a card approaching &quot;excellent&quot; condition while the best I could rateit was &quot;very good.&quot; But even at my grade -- and these are highly debatabledistinctions -- their price of $100 matched up with my price guide. If youagreed with their evaluation of the condition, it was underpriced by $60 ormore.;    The store has other intriguing facets, including a one-in-eightchance of selecting a rack pack containing a Jerry Rice rookie card. Therealso is an unusually large inventory of older cards. If you're searching foranything in particular, the phone number is (408) 395-5332.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Antonucci  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910514  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  477  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 14, 199100135195,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
