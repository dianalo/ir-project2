When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait he doubtlessassumed that his naked aggression would be met with a greatdeal of rhetoric, but little more. The West, after all, issoft and self-indulgent; America's insatiable need forimmediate oil supplies surely would make a concerted,sustained effort to go without Iraq's oil out of thequestion.   Something like the same strategy must have been in theminds of the Actors Equity Council, which voted two weeks agoto forbid the appearance of British star Jonathan Pryce inthe forthcoming Broadway musical &quot;Miss Saigon.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The issue, the council argued, was one of discrimination:Mr. Pryce is white and the role he plays in the Londonproduction is half-French and half-Vietnamese.   Actors Equity has been very concerned in recent years withthe casting of minorities in theater productions. Admittedly,there has been a bit of confusion about its various stands.On the one hand, it insists that roles be performed by anactor of the race or nationality so designated: blackperformers in black roles, Hispanic actors in Hispanic roles,and so forth.   But it also has made a big pitch for &quot;color-blind&quot;casting: black actresses, for example, playing the SwedishMiss Julie or the Southern Blanche DuBois. Obviously there isa serious contradiction here.   You can't encourage the casting of an African-American asa Caucasian and forbid a Caucasian to play an Asian. But thatis exactly what Equity did, and one reason is that it thoughtit could call the bluff of &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; producer CameronMackintosh.   In point of fact, Equity had no legal basis for refusingpermission for Mr. Pryce to appear. The contract between theproducers and Equity has to do with British-Americanexchanges, not with discrimination. Neither country's actingunion will allow an actor from the other country to appearunless he or she is an acknowledged star. But Mr. Pryce is astar, having been designated as such by Equity when heappeared in the U.S. in 1984 in &quot;Comedians.&quot;   There were a number of other ironies in the situation, onebeing that Mr. Pryce is a political activist in Britain and alife-long fighter for the rights of minorities. Then there isthe supreme irony that &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; would employ more than30 Asian-American actors -- more than have been in anyBroadway show in decades.   None of this mattered to the members of the EquityCouncil, however. They intended to carry through with theirgrandstand play on minority casting because they felt theyhad Mr. Mackintosh just where they wanted him.   The advance sale for &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; -- originally scheduledto open here next March -- was an unprecedented $25 million,a sum that would corrupt any producer, as Equity saw it,since, in its view, producers are greedy creatures for whomthe dollar is everything. This, Equity apparently thought,must be especially true of Mr. Mackintosh, who with &quot;Cats,&quot;&quot;Les Miserables&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; is the mostcommercially successful theater producer of modern times.   It was true, of course, that Mr. Mackintosh had stated hewould cancel the production and return the $25 million if hecould not use Mr. Pryce. But Equity did not believe him. Whatdifference could one star make, it reasoned, with such a hugeadvance? The production would make money no matter what.   Adding to Equity's confidence in calling Mr. Mackintosh'sbluff was its fallback position. If the ruling went againsthim, Mr. Mackintosh doubtless would take the matter toarbitration, where, many in Equity agreed, he would win hiscase. Then Equity would have it both ways: It would have madeits self-righteous point, but the production would still goon.   The Equity Council made a few miscalculations, however.For one thing, Mr. Mackintosh does not need the money: He'salready the richest theater man in the Western world and onemore mega-hit is not at the top of his priorities. Also, he'sa man of principle where theater production is concerned. Hedid not become so pre-eminently successful by compromising onhis theatrical values, including the stars in his shows.   Mr. Mackintosh was interested in only two points: thatEquity should honor its contract, and that he should beallowed to employ the actor whom he thought was best for theshow.   In his mind the part of the Eurasian pimp in &quot;MissSaigon,&quot; who also serves as a narrator, requires a performerwith an exceptional flair, bite and cutting edge. Not onlywas there no Asian-American who qualified, there was noAmerican period. (Having seen Mr. Pryce in the role inLondon, one can easily understand Mr. Mackintosh's position.)   To the consternation of Equity, not only did Mr.Mackintosh cancel the production -- setting up a mechanism toreturn the advance -- but he refused to take the matter toarbitration.   Immediately the entire theater world descended on Equity.This was depriving hundreds of future employment. It wasgoing to seriously affect the economy of New York andcountless other cities across the U.S. where the productionmight go in future years.   New York Mayor David Dinkins quickly summoned the Equityleaders to his office at City Hall. Theater writers pointedout that Equity's vaunted ethical position was riddled withinconsistencies.(Black performers recently have appeared inleading white roles in unprecedented numbers.)   Under the pressure, Equity members in current Broadwayshows petitioned the council to reconsider. Their bluff hadbeen called not just by Mr. Mackintosh, but by a unitedtheater community. Last Thursday, in a six-hour meeting, theEquity Council reversed itself. Equity's executive secretarystated afterward that the union welcomed Mr. Pryce and wishedMr. Mackintosh a &quot;long and prosperous run.&quot;   Mr. Mackintosh has said he will respond today or tomorrow.Every expectation is that he will resume his plans to bring&quot;Miss Saigon&quot; to Broadway and that Mr. Pryce will agree tocome along.</TEXT></DOC>
