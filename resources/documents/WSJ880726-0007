The smelter here produces 270,000 metric tons of aluminum annually, or about 25% of Alcan's Canadian capacity.    Allan Hewitson, an Alcan spokesman, said the workers, who are members of the Canadian Association of Smelter andamp; Allied Workers, will be in a legal strike position 48 hours after the mediator completes his report. He said he didn't know when the report would be completed.    The main impasse to a settlement concerns the retroactivity of an eventual settlement, Mr. Hewitson said. The labor contract between Montreal-based Alcan and its unionized workers in Kitimat expired at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.    &quot;This is as close as we've been to a strike situation,&quot; said Mr. Hewitson. There have been only two strikes at the Kitimat facility, a legal walkout in 1970 and an illegal strike in 1976, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
