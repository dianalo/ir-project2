West German ARD television said the city prosecutor's office hadstarted an investigation against 78-year-old Erich Gutjahr forpossibly violating German laws with his reported statements.   Several members of the city council demanded the resignation ofGutjahr, a 78-year-old member of the rightist National Party ofGermany, known by its German initials, NPD.   The NPD, whose views are often likened to those of Germanneo-Nazi groups, won seven city council seats in local elections inMarch, giving the ultrarightist party a minority voice in thelaw-making body.   Gutjahr, in an interview printed Friday by the FrankfurtAllgemeine newspaper, was quoted as saying, ``Jews have bought uphalf of the city.''   According to the newspaper, Gutjahr also said: ``The Jews areplundering us again. Something must be done about this.''   He could not be reached Friday to comment on the newspaperreport.   Gutjahr, a strident anti-communist, also said he would rathersee city property put under government control before more of it issold to Jewish buyers, the newspaper reported.   The elderly councilman denied being anti-Semitic but said heonly wants to protect ``German interests,'' it said.   The newspaper further quoted him as insulting West GermanPresident Richard von Weizsaecker by calling the liberal-leaningpresident a ``lump,'' a degrading German word meaning ``limpworthless rag.''   Legislator Jo Meergans, a member of the city's governing SocialDemocratic Party, said Gutjahr's remarks constituted a violation ofWest Germany's laws against inciting the public. He demanded theFrankfurt prosecutor's office launch an investigation, which thetelevision said had already begun.</TEXT></DOC>
