 Home offices can create asmany problems as they solve.andP;  Cramped work spaces, telephone line conundrums,communication glitches, isolation and a lack of technical support can combineto make working at home a frustrating experience.andM;That needn't be the case.andP;  With a little time and the right tools, you canturn your home office into an ideal workplace, whether you spend time thereon weekends, one or two days a week or even if you become a full-timetelecommuter.andM;THE INSIDE LINE ON COMMUNICATIONSandM;No home office is an island.andP;  If you can't communicate with your corporateoffice, you can't do your job.andP;  The biggest problem you'll face at home iscommunicating electronically with headquarters and the outside world.andM;First, you'll need access to your corporate PC while you're at home.andP;  You'llhave to retrieve files from it and use it as a portal to your company'snetwork, electronic mail and laser printers.andM;Remote-access software will let you do that.andP;  Use it with your phone line todial into and control your office PC from your home computer.andP;  You can alsotransfer files between home and office with it.andP;  Since you're controlling themachine over telephone lines, screen refreshes tend to be slow-they'relimited by the speed of your modem.andP;  Because of this, it's best not to runapplications other than simple, text-based ones (an e-mail package, forexample) over the phone lines.andP;  Instead, transfer the files you need fromyour office to your home PC, then run your application locally.andM;Perhaps the software is best used for accessing your company's network.andP;  Dialinto your PC and log on to the network as you normally would.andP;  Then send andreceive electronic mail and files across the network as if you were in yourcorporate office.andP;  You can also run a company printer from home.andP;  If you havea big printing job, however, and don't want to tie up a network printerduring the day, dial in at night and do the job then.andM;Topping the list of remote packages is pcAnywhere IV.andP;  Its low cost ($179),sophisticated file-handling features, fast transfer speed and all-around easeof use make it ideal for the home office.andP;  It allows you to reach your officePC even if you have to dial in through a human-operated switchboard.andP;  First,use the program to place a voice call.andP;  Then ask the operator to switch youto your office PC's extension.andP;  Finally, switch to data mode when you hearyour modem's high-pitched screech.andM;* Fax FactsandM;When working at home, you'll need more than just access to your corporate PC.andO;You'll also require use of that ubiquitous business appurtenance, the faxmachine.andP;  Full-featured fax machines cost anywhere from $800 on up (with theemphasis on the up).andP;  If you work at home only a day or so a week or duringevenings, however, it doesn't make sense to fork over that much money for anitem you'll use only occasionally.andM;Instead, consider buying a fax board.andP;  Combination fax boards and modems areavailable for less than $500; several manufacturers make fax boards, withoutmodems attached, for less than $200.andP;  And prices are heading lower.andP;  Beware,however, of devices that call themselves &quot;broadcast faxes,&quot; which is a fancyway of saying the board sends faxes but can't receive them.andP;  Also, buy a9,600-bps, rather than a 4,800-bps, version (some of the lower-priced boardsrun at the lower rate).andP;  One further caveat: Some fax boards, although ratedat 9,600 bps, will run only at 4,800 bps on a PC or XT.andP;  If you have lessthan an AT-class machine, cheek your board before you buy.andM;If you already have a modem and just need a fax board, you won't find abetter deal than the $195 Frecom Fax96 from Fremont Communications.andP;  Itfeatures sophisticated but simple-to-use software that runs as a TSR(requiring 65K).andP;  Even more impressive is Frecom's $295 1-Liner fax board,which is ideal for the home office because it can share a single phone linewith an outbound modem, a telephone and an answering machine.andP;  The boardautomatically detects whether a call is a fax or regular phone call andtransfers it to the proper device.andP;  It also includes FarFetchFax software,which lets you dial into your home office from another location-yourcorporate office, for example-and forward fax messages to a fax machine ofyour choice.andM;If you need a modem and a fax board, Everex's EverFax 24/96 is a solid buy.andO;It packs a 9,600-bps fax and an MNP 5 modem onto a single card for $399.andP;  Faxsoftware runs as a 92K TSR.andP;  The EverFax 24/96 also lets you usecommunications software with your modem while your fax board is waiting for acall, although you can't send or receive while using the modem.andM;* Phone Line GridlockandM;With all this equipment hooked up to your phones-fax, modem, telephone, notto mention an answering machine-you'll need to devise a way to manage yourphone lines and prevent communications gridlock.andP;  First decide whether yourequire one or two phone lines.andP;  If you have a low or moderate volume of faxand modem traffic, one line will suffice.andM;You'll need to route that traffic among all your devices, however, so buy avoice/data switch.andP;  At $179, the 1-Line, from Acco, is a good buy for thehome office.andP;  It enables one phone line to serve triple duty, automaticallyswitching incoming calls to a fax board/modem, telephone or answeringmachine.andP;  If you have a standalone modem and a fax, it accommodates thatsetup as well.andM;If you need more than one phone line, let your modem and fax share one ofthem and use the other for your telephone and answering machine.andP;  In someparts of the country, a new phone service called &quot;distinctive ringing&quot;simplifies the use of multiple phone lines in the home office.andP;  This serviceallows as many as three incoming phone numbers to share a single line.andP;  Eachnumber gives a different, distinctive ring, notifying you, for example, thata call is for your home office rather than your residence.andP;  Distinctiveringing can be especially beneficial when used in concert with a voice/ dataswitch.andP;  Set separate rings for your fax, modem and telephone; the switchwill recognize each distinctive tone and switch among them.andP;  The $149 Switch,from High-Tech Resources, does just that.andP;  (Note: Distinctive ringing isn'tavailable yet in all parts of the country, and it goes by different names indifferent areas.andP;  Check with your local phone company for more information.)andM;When at home, be on the lookout for &quot;dirty&quot; telephone lines-lines bedeviledby transmission glitches that can garble fax and modem transmissions andreceptions.andP;  An easy fix is provided by the Noise Buster, a $19.95 devicethat filters line garbage.andP;  Plug the cord from your modem or fax in one end,a line to your wall jack in the other.andP;  Another fix: Buy a modem witherror-control protocols such as MNP 4 or V42.andM;HARDWARE FOR A SMALL OFFICEandM;Buying hardware for your home office is a balancing act of four concerns:power, price, support and physical size of the machine.andP;  Power and priceconcerns should be obvious.andP;  Equally important, however, is support: If yourcomputer crashes, you want to be able to replace it as quickly as possible.andO;In less severe situations, you want a knowledgeable person on the other endof the line, armed with good advice.andP;  Remember too that most home offices arestrapped for space, so your hardware should have the smallest footprintpossible.andP;  In general (and when it's economically feasible), re-create athome the kind of computing power you have at your c rate office.andP;  Otherwise,you'll defeat the purpose of a home office.andP;  If you have an underpowered CPU,you won't be able to take work home.andM;With this in mind, it doesn't make sense to buy anything other than a 386 foryour home office.andP;  At work, you'll need a 386 to run current andnext-generation software; get the same power at home as well.andP;  Also, pick upthat 386 in a &quot;slim-line&quot; case.andP;  These small-footprint PCs are ideal for thehome office where every inch of desktop real estate counts.andM;The SlimLine 386/20, from Northgate Computer Systems, is the best of thebunch and the ideal machine for the home office.andP;  For $2,999, you get a 20MHz386 (a full 386, not an SX), 2MB of memory, a VGA board and monitor, 5 1/4-and 3 1/2-inch high-capacity floppy drives and a 40MB, 28ms hard drive.andP;  Fiveexpansion slots are included, which is a rarity-slim-lines generally featureonly three.andP;  Everything has been wedged into a neat little package 4 1/4inches high and 16 1/2 inches square.andP;  Be aware, however, that spaceconsiderations have forced one compromise: To get at two of the expansionslots, you have to unscrew the unit's power supply.andP;  Also, if you put in aninternal modem or fax board, you must first disable a physical serial port bysetting switches on the motherboard.andM;(As PC/Computing went to press, Northgate planned to drop the price on its20MHz SlimLine and unveil a more powerful machine at a comparable price.andP;  Byearly fall, the company plans to release a 25MHz machine in the same SlimLinecase.andP;  Configured with 2MB of memory, an 80MB, 18ms hard drive, two floppydrives and VGA board and monitor, the unit will carry a price tag of $3,199.andO;Included in that price are a Microsoft mouse, Microsoft Windows 3.0 and twoWindows-based programs: the Ami Pro word processor and the Wingzspreadsheet.)andM;Northgate's support is as impressive as its PC's power and solid pricing.andO;The company maintains a toll-free technical support line 24 hours a day,seven days a week.andP;  If a problem can't be resolved over the phone, Northgatewill provide on-site service to many locations.andP;  The PC also carries aone-year warranty; if a part fails, Northgate will send a replacement partovernight.andP;  There's a 30-day tryout period as well.andP;  If you're not happy withyour PC or with Northgate service, log on to CompuServe and scream-Northgateowner Art Lazere responds to customer complaints online.andM;* PrintersandM;For those with limited home office space, printers have long posed aproblem-the only way to get quality output has been to devote a sizableamount of desk space to a laser.andP;  Small-footprint, lower-cost lasers havehelped remedy that situation.andP;  For example, for a street price of about $900,Hewlett-Packard's IIP takes up far less space than its larger laser siblings.andO;Meanwhile, HP's ink jet printer, the HP DeskJet 5000, makes even moreeconomical use of desk space while taking a smaller bite out of your wallet.andO;Listing for $729, the DeskJet 5000 is likely to retail for less than $500.andO;It features four internal typefaces and a resolution of 300 dots per inch.andO;It is capable of printing three pages of text or two pages of graphics perminute.andM;If even these printers occupy more room than you can reasonably spare, analternative exists in the form of the Canon Bubble Jet BJ-10e, a remarkablysmall, low-cost printer.andP;  Its light weight and compact size make itparticularly well-suited for people who maintain a home office and put in alot of travel time, too.andM;Measuring 12 1/4 inches wide by 8 1/2 inches deep by 2 inches high, the CanonBJ-10e lists for $499 ($569 with optional sheet feeder).andP;  Print qualityrivals that of the HP DeskJet 5000, although it is slightly inferior tolasers.andP;  It comes with two built-in fonts-Courier and Prestige Elite-andprints at 10, 12 and 17 characters per inch with proportional spacing.andO;Downloadable bitmap fonts are available as well.andP;  The BJ-10e emulates an IBMProprinter X24E, which makes it compatible with most software.andP;  One drawbackis the lack of built-in Laser-Jet emulation.andP;  But LaserTwin, a $179 packagefrom Metro Software of Tucson, Arizona, solves that problem.andM;The BJ-10e's economical use of space does harbor two drawbacks.andP;  The sheetfeeder holds only about 15 pages (don't believe its rated capacity of 30),which means you'll be doing a lot of paper changing if you regularly printlengthy reports.andP;  Nor is the BJ-10e speedy-it chugs along at about a page anda half of text a minute.andM;Still, if you have a home office with no space to spare, or if your homeoffice printer must pull double duty as a travel printer, the BJ-10e isideal.andP;  It even makes short work of printing envelopes.andM;* ModemsandM;The obvious communications solution for a home office strapped for space isan internal modem.andP;  Since it fits inside your PC, you forfeit virtually nowork space.andP;  Internal modems, however, have their drawbacks.andP;  They are oftena cause of hardware conflicts.andP;  To resolve them, you have to open your case,remove the modem, reset jumpers or switches, then reinstall the modem.andO;Additionally, you might not have a free slot in your PC, or be willing tosurrender one to a device that can easily fit into a free serial port.andP;  Andsome PCs (such as Northgate's SlimLine) require you to set jumpers orswitches on the motherboard before installing an internal modem.andM;The Hayes Personal Modem 2400plus solves these problems.andP;  It's an externalmodem that mounts on a standard wall outlet, thus saving desktop space.andP;  For$199 you get the modem, cables and Smartcom EZ, a stripped-down version ofHayes' Smartcom software.andP;  In addition, the 2400plus includes startersoftware designed for the CheckFree electronic payment system and forPC-Link, an online news, shopping and educational database service.andM;You do give up something, however: The modem doesn't have flashing LEDs tolet you monitor the progress of the call.andP;  And it comes with a 25-pinconnector, which means that if your PC has a 9-pin serial port, you'll haveto buy an inexpensive 25-pin-to-9-pin converter at an electronics store suchas Radio Shack.andP;  If the modem and a telephone share a single phone line,you'll also have to buy a phone splitter, which is a small plastic devicethat costs less than $10 and is available at most hardware, phone andelectronics stores.andP;  Keep in mind also that the 2400plus modem won't allowfor synchronous communications, which may be used on your company'smainframes.andM;TECHNICAL SUPPORT-ON YOUR OWNandM;When something goes wrong with the equipment at your corporate office, youwalk down the hall to your tech support person.andP;  But at home, you're the techsupport, so be sure to have a hardware and software toolkit on hand in caseof an emergency.andP;  It should include diagnostic software for troubleshooting,as well as hardware tools for solving the problem once you've found it.andM;Begin with a good piece of diagnostic software.andP;  Most of the problems you'llface at home involve hardware and software conflicts that occur when youinstall a new board or piece of software.andP;  Diagnostic software will help youresolve those conflicts or, better yet, make sure they never happen.andM;Three software packages are equal to the task.andP;  InfoSpotter, from Merrill andamp;Bryan Enterprises, Manifest, from Quarterdeck, and System Sleuth, fromDariana Technology Group, will assess your system and provide basicinformation on which hardware interrupts (IRQs) are in use, which memoryaddresses your programs use, your DOS and BIOS version, the amount and typeof memory in your machine and a variety of other technical details.andP;  Manifesteven offers advice on how to fine-tune your system for better performance.andM;For emergencies, you should always have nearby the granddaddy offile-recovery utilities, The Norton Utilities, now up to Version 5.0.andP;  Itsdata-recovery feature alone makes this a must-have for any home office.andP;  Butthere's much more packed in here as well, including new hard disk diagnosticsand maintenance features and an improved interface.andM;A well-stocked hardware toolkit is also a must.andP;  Build one yourself or buyone of the many prepackaged kits now on the market.andP;  CompuAdd, for example,offers an $11.95 toolkit that's more than adequate for just about any task.andO;If you build your own, include small and medium-sized Phillips-headscrewdrivers, nutdrivers and regular screwdrivers.andP;  Also throw in a pair oftweezers for handling small parts, as well as a three-pronged partsextractor, a nasty-looking little plastic-and-wire device for retrievingsmall objects that have fallen inside the case of your PC.andP;  If you'll beremoving chips from your PC, buy a chip extractor for prying them out.andO;Clear, anti-static tubes for storing miscellaneous parts will come in handy,too.andP;  Finally, make sure to pack a small flashlight for directing light whereyou want it.andM;(Need help selecting those PC utilities that make life easier?

Knowing which work should bedone at the magazine's offices and which at home.andP;  Home is the best place forsolo work: writing, troubleshooting hardware and software  all the researchand installation for last month's cover story on do-it-yourself networks, forexample, I did at home) and editing long pieces.andP;  The magazine's offices arebest for story meetings, short editing sessions, planning parleys and thenormal, unclassifiable, face-to-face give-and-take that constitutes the heartof any publication.andM;Why go to all the trouble to work at home a day or two a week? For me, itoffers the best possible mix of work and family life.andP;  I have a five-year-olddaughter and a seven-month-old son.andP;  At the magazine's offices, when I take abreak, it's to schmooze with other editors.andP;  But here at home I con watch inwonder as my son laughs uproariously because a leaf blew in the window, or Ican become the audience for one of my daughter's command performances as aballerina fairy dog from outer space.andM;I'm more productive as well.andP;  I write and edit more articles now than when Ispent all my time at the magazine.andP;  And I spend more time working.andP;  Mostevenings after my children are off to bed, I can be found tapping away at mykeyboard or installing some new add-on board to one of my PCs.andM;In fact, I've come across only one real problem when working at home: how tokeep my daughter from monopolizing the computer at night with Teenage MutantNinja Turtles and Reader Rabbit.andP;  I haven't found a solution to the problemyet, but it's not a bad one to live with.andM;The Basics of Home Office DesignandM;Most likely, you've had little say about the design of your corporate office.andO;Industrial designers probably chose your furniture and maybe even determinedwhere all your equipment would go.andM;At home, though, you're on your own; you are the industrial designer.andP;  Andyou face a significant design hurdle when your home office is located in anawkward space: an odd-shaped spare room, the corner of a living room, abreakfast nook.andP;  But if you know the basics of ergonomic design, almost anyarea can be tailored to maximize space, comfort and convenience.andM;The nature of your work should guide your design.andP;  For example, ergonomistsrecommend that, for reading and writing longhand, your desktop stand 28 1/2inches from the floor.andP;  For typing it should stand only 24 to 27 inches high,so your arms can rest comfortably at your sides.andP;  If you work as much withyour PC as with your pen, get a dedicated workstation for the computer.andP;  Manyroll nimbly out of the way if space is tight; others fit snugly against thewall in modular cabinets.andM;Whatever computing work area you choose, make sure you have plenty of kickspace underneath (which typically rules out using the return on an L-shapeddesk).andP;  if you tend to hunch over your desk, get a foot wedge or foot rest toforestall backaches and reduce neck and shoulder tension.andP;  Likewise, a wristrest can prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful stiffness in the hands.andO;You can also buy a clutter-saving keyboard drawer that tucks your keyboardneatly out of the way and has a wrist rest built-in.andM;Your monitor should sit 10 to 30 degrees below eye level and 16 to 24 inchesfrom your face.andP;  Position it away from direct sunlight.andP;  If windows supplymost of the ambient light in your office, you'll want the flexibility toadjust your monitor's angle to compensate for the sun's presence.andP;  A good betis a monitor arm that can support at least 30 pounds.andP;  Also, get a glarescreen from your local computer supply store.andM;Since your office chair is central to your health and comfort, you'll want tosit in several, rather than order from a catalog, before buying.andP;  Make sureyou can adjust the chair's height and the vertical angle of its back.andP;  A goodchair will move with you as you lean forward or backward.andP;  Remember thatarmless chairs are better for typing and that five-legged chairs are morestable than four-legged ones.andP;  Also, if your office is carpeted, a rubber matfor your chair will protect the carpet and ground static electricity.andM;Thanks to modular wall systems, which work like building blocks of cabinets,you con slide out your phone, fax and printer on trays when they're needed,then slip them back out of sight.andP;  Keep in mind that many printers havecooling fans, so ovoid running them from an enclosed cabinet space.andP;  If youuse an impact printer, consider getting a dedicated printer stand withshelves and slots for easier paper management.andM;All the space-saving devices in the world won't necessarily make your officefeel less cramped, though, and that can induce fatigue-and even depression.andO;Ergonomists recommend designing your office with as many sources of light aspossible.andP;  Use hard window coverings, such as velours, blinds or shuttersinstead of drapes so that you can control the amount and direction of light.andO;Point the surrounding walls white or a very pale color; it will make a smallroom seem larger.andP;  Finally, vary the lighting with task lamps, using bothfloor-standing and adjustable desktop models.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
