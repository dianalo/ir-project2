In addition to substantive changes, the AppealsRegulations and Rules of Practice have been reorganized for greater usefulness.The Appeals Regulations are now the primary source of regulatory provisionsconcerning the internal operations of Department of Veterans Affairs fieldfacilities and the Board of Veterans' Appeals with respect to appeals processingwhile the Rules of Practice are the primary source of information of interestto appellants and their representatives concerning their rights and responsibilitiesin the appeals process. The Appeals Regulations remain in part 19, whilethe Rules of Practice have been placed in new part 20. Both the Rules ofPractice and the Appeals Regulations have been renumbered, reserving numbersbetween major subdivisions so that they may be expanded logically in thefuture when the need arises.

Frequently, the claimant will agreewith adjudicative action taken on some issues and disagree with actiontaken with respect to others. Material has been added to point out thatwhen notice is received concerning the disposition of several issues, theclaimant or representative should identify which determinations he or shedisagrees with in the Notice of Disagreement.andSection; 20.202: Rule 202. Based on old Rules of Practice 23, paragraph (a), and 26 (38 CFR 19.123(a) and 19.126). Revisions have been made tonote that a Substantive Appeal should make it clear which issues are beingappealed when the Statement of the Case and any prior Supplemental Statementsof the Case have addressed multiple issues. Amended to note that the Boardmay dismiss an appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law,as provided by 38 U.S.C. 4005(d)(5) and as previously noted in old Rule26 (andSection; 19.126), and to incorporate the change to 38 U.S.C. 4005(d)(4)made by Section 206(b) of Public Law 100- 687.andSection; 20.203: Rule 203. Based on old Rule of Practice 37 (38 CFR 19.137).andSection; 20.204: Rule 204.

Based on old Rule of Practice 27 (38 CFR 19.127).On occasion, because a claimant has moved to another area or for some otherreason, applicable files will be transferred from one  Department of VeteransAffairs office to another after an action is taken which a claimant wishesto appeal, but before a Notice of Disagreement and/or Substantive Appealis filed. This rule has been amended to allow for this contingency.andSection; 20.301: Rule 301. Based on old Rule of Practice 28 (38 CFR 19.128).andSection; 20.302: Rule 302. Based on old Rule of Practice 29 (38 CFR 19.129).Amended to make it clear that this rule does not apply to cases involvingsimultaneously contested claims. (Time limits for filing in simultaneouslycontested claims are set out in Rule 501 (andSection; 20.501).) Paragraph(c) previously pointed out that there must be a response to a SupplementalStatement of the Case which includes new issues which were not includedin the Statement of the Case, but it did not indicate the nature of therequired response. When new issues are included in a Supplemental Statementof the Case it becomes, in effect, the Statement of the Case with respectto the new issues and the response required is therefore a SubstantiveAppeal. New material has been added to make this clear. Particularly inview of this situation, the time for responding to a Supplemental Statementof the Case has been lengthened to 60 days. Material has also been addedto paragraph (c) to make it clear that the 60-day period allowed for responseto a Supplemental Statement of the Case begins with the mailing of theSupplemental Statement of the Case.andSection; 20.303: Rule 303. Based on old Rule of Practice 30, paragraph(a) (38 CFR 19.130(a)). Material has been added to allow for filing requestsfor an extension of time with the office which has assumed jurisdictionover the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs records in cases wherethe records have been transferred after the action being appealed was taken.andSection; 20.304: Rule 304. Based on old Rule of Practice 30, paragraph(b) (38 CFR 19.130(b)).andSection; 20.305: Rule 305. Based on old Rule of Practice 31 (38 CFR 19.131).Revised to show that this rule applies to the computation of the time limitfor filing any written document, not just to the time limit for filinga Notice of Disagreement or Substantive Appeal. A presumption has beenadded that the postmark date is five days prior to the receipt of the documentin those cases where the postmark is not of record due to the loss of themailing envelope, etc.andSection; 20.306: Rule 306. Based on old Rule of Practice 32 (38 CFR 19.132).andSection; 20.400: Rule 400. Based on old Rules of Practice 40 and 41 (38CFR 19.140 and 19.141). (Some of the concepts previously found in old Ruleof Practice 40 are also found in new 38 CFR 19.52.) The last sentence ofthis rule has been revised. While a representative may act upon behalfof a claimant with his or her authorization, only the claimant may authorizea merged appeal.andSection; 20.401: Rule 401. Based on old Rule of Practice 42 (38 CFR 19.142).andSection; 20.500: Rule 500. Based on old Rule of Practice 44 (38 CFR 19.144).andSection; 20.501: Rule 501. Based on old Rule of Practice 45 (38 CFR 19.145).The definition has been removed from the first sentence of paragraph (a).Definitions, including the definition of ``simultaneously contested claim,''are now grouped in Rule 3 (andSection; 20.3). New paragraph (c) added toprovide information concerning action to be taken by claimants/appellantsand their representatives when a Supplemental Statement of the Case isreceived in a simultaneously contested claim.andSection; 20.502: Rule 502. This rule and new 38 CFR 19.102 are based onold Rule of Practice 47 (38 CFR 19.147). The old rule combined action tobe taken by the agency of original jurisdiction, more properly the subjectof an Appeal Regulation, with action to be taken by an appellant or representativewhen notice of the substance of an appeal by another contesting party isreceived in a simultaneously contested claim. The rewritten rule focuseson the latter. A new Appeal Regulation (andSection; 19.102) addresses theformer. The revised rule provides that a copy of the actual SubstantiveAppeal will be furnished to all other contesting parties. It also clarifieswhen the 30-day period allowed for a response commences.andSection; 20.503: Rule 503. Based on old Rule of Practice 48 (38 CFR 19.148).andSection; 20.504: Rule 504.

Based on old Rule of Practice 52, paragraphs(a) and (b) (38 CFR 19.152 (a) and (b)). Material added to paragraph (a)to point out that an attorney-at law may be designated through the useof a VA Form 2-22a, as well as through the alternative procedure outlinedin the rule; that all designations of attorneys-at-law must be to individualsrather than partnerships or firms; that an attorney's authority to actas a representative may be limited as noted in 38 CFR 14.631(d); that adesignation of a representative is not effective until it is received bythe Department of Veterans Affairs; and to note the existing practice ofcontinuing to recognize a representative designated prior to initiationof an appeal if the designation has not been revoked. Reference to appellant'sguardian removed from the third sentence as unnecessary. (If an individualhas a legal guardian, the guardian is the appellant.) The material previouslycontained in the last sentence of paragraph (a) has been moved to Rule606 (andSection; 20.606). Cross-reference material removed from body of paragraph(b).

They will have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendmentswill not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason for this certification is that the proposedregulations would have only a limited, beneficial effect on claimants/appellantsand their representatives. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these proposedregulations are therefore exempt from the initial and final regulatoryflexibility analyses requirements of sections 603 and 604.There are no Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers associatedwith these proposed regulatory amendments.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>38 CFR Part 14Claims, Foreign relations, Government employees, Lawyers, Legal services,Organization and functions (Government agencies), Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Surety bonds, Trusts and trustees, Veterans.38 CFR Part 19Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Veterans.38 CFR Part 20Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Lawyers, Legal services,Veterans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: July 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.

Such an agreement will be honored by the Department only if thefollowing conditions are met:(i) The total fee payable (excluding expenses) does not exceed 20 percentof the total amount of the past-due benefits awarded,(ii) The amount of the fee is contingent on whether or not the claim isresolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, and(iii) The award of past-due benefits results in a cash payment to a claimantor an appellant from which the fee may be deducted. (An award of past-duebenefits will not always result in a cash payment to a claimant or an appellant.For example, no cash payment will be made to military retirees unless thereis a corresponding waiver of retirement pay. (See 38 U.S.C. 3104(a) andandSection; 3.750 <T3>et seq</T3>. of this chapter.))(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a claim will be considered to havebeen resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if allor any part of the relief sought is granted.(3) For purposes of this paragraph, ``past-due benefits'' means a nonrecurringpayment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awardedon the basis of a claim reopened after a denial by the Board of Veterans'Appeals or the lump sum payment which represents the total amount of recurringcash payments which accrued between the effective date of the award, asdetermined by applicable laws and regulations, and the date of the grantof the benefit by the agency of original jurisdiction, the Board of Veterans'Appeals, or an appellate court.(i) When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the reopenedclaim, is service connection for a disability, the ``past-due benefits''will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the agency oforiginal jurisdiction following the award of service connection. The sumwill equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award tothe date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased evaluationis subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability evaluationinitially assigned by the agency of original jurisdiction, and if the attorney-at-lawor agent represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim,the attorney-at-law or agent will be paid a supplemental payment at thetime that the appellant is paid retroactive benefits based upon the increasegranted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disabilityis found to have existed between the initial effective date of the awardfollowing the grant of service connection and the date of the rating actionimplementing the appellate decision granting the increase.(ii) Unless otherwise provided in the fee agreement between the claimantor appellant and the attorney-at-law or agent, the attorney-at law's oragent's fees will be determined on the basis of the total amount of thepast-due benefits even though a portion of those benefits may have beenapportioned to the claimant's or appellant's dependents.(iii) If an award is made as the result of favorable action with respectto several issues, the past-due benefits will be calculated only on thebasis of that portion of the award which results from action taken on issuesconcerning which the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section have beenmet.(4) In addition to filing a copy of the fee agreement with the Board ofVeterans' Appeals as required by paragraph (g) of this section, the attorneyor agent must notify the agency of original jurisdiction within 30 daysof the date of execution of the agreement of the existence of an agreementproviding for the direct payment of fees out of any benefits subsequentlydetermined to be past-due and provide that agency with a copy of the feeagreement. Payment of the attorney's or agent's share of any past-due benefitswill be made at the same time that any such benefits are paid to the claimantor appellant.(i) <T3>Motion for review of fee agreement</T3>. The Board of Veterans' Appealsmay review a fee agreement between a claimant or appellant and an attorney-at-lawor agent upon its own motion or upon the motion of any party to the agreementand may order a reduction in the fee called for in the agreement if itfinds that the fee is excessive or unreasonable in light of the standardsset forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Such motions must be in writingand must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellantif other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor or guardian), theapplicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and the reason whythe amount of the fee is felt to be excessive or unreasonable. Such motionsmust be filed at the following address: Office of the Chairman, SpecialLegal Assistant (OlC), Board of Veterans' Appeals, 810 Vermont Avenue NW,Washington, DC 20420. The moving party must mail a copy of the motion toall other parties to the agreement, with return receipts requested. Thereceipts, which must bear the signatures of the other parties, must thenbe filed with the Board at the same address as proof of service of themotion.

If a reduction in thefee is ordered, the attorney or agent must credit the account of the claimantor appellant with the amount of the reduction and refund any excess paymenton account to the claimant or appellant not later than the expiration ofthe time within which the ruling may be appealed to the Court of VeteransAppeals.
