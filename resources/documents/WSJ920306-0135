The great creator of such immortalities as &quot;Il Barbiere diSiviglia&quot; and tournedos Rossini was 200 years old that day,and for many of us this was cause for celebration.Festivities are everywhere. A special Rossini train carryingpoliticians, musicologists, musicians and journalists madeworshipful stops in his hometown of Pesaro and in Florence,where he is buried. Riccardo Muti conducted the Stabat Materat La Scala Saturday and Tulsa hummed to a rare production ofhis dazzling fairy-tale opera, &quot;Armida,&quot; as directed byNicholas Muni.</LP><TEXT>   And so the Rossini crescendo begins. Thanks to thesimultaneous rise of technically accomplished singers andmuch rigorous archival dusting at the Fondazione Rossini inPesaro these past dozen years, a newly rounded Rossini hasstepped from the shadows. Think of the Rossini-related tripsyou can make in the U.S. alone: to Omaha for &quot;Ermione,&quot; toSan Francisco for &quot;William Tell&quot; and to Chicago, where theLyric's season opens with &quot;Otello.&quot;   These aren't joke-filled toe-tappers (though &quot;Otello&quot;exists with an alternative happy ending that has its own oddcharm), and that is a major aspect of the Rossini revival. Hebrings to mind &quot;Barbiere&quot; and maybe &quot;La Cenerentola,&quot; but hewas as much and maybe more a composer of serious operas thatexplored the frailties of the heart in the flowery musicallanguage of the day. In the majority of his operas, peoplesuffer greatly and even die, while, ironically, one of thefunniest pieces he ever penned, &quot;Il Viaggio a Reims,&quot; stillawaits the attentions of a major American opera house.Perhaps the Met, where his portrait is festooned with garlic,will put it on for its own bicentennial in 2083. Thecompany's birthday present is a stolid old &quot;Barbiere&quot;(brightened by Thomas Hampson) and a warmed-over&quot;Semiramide.&quot;   At least the amazing finale of &quot;Viaggio&quot; for 14 nuts (whohave bungled a trip to the coronation of Charles X) made itto the Rossini gala program at Avery Fisher Hall. Athree-hour fete, both puzzling and pleasurable, it unfoldedunder a cliched photograph of the fat master sporting one ofthe ill-fitting wigs he favored in his later years. But whenhe wrote &quot;Bianca e Falliero,&quot; &quot;La Gazza Ladra,&quot; &quot;Zelmira&quot; and&quot;La Donna del Lago,&quot; just some of the works on the program,he was of course a much younger, thinner man without majordewlaps or digestive problems.   Except for the British conductor, Roger Norrington, thiswas an all-American event. On stage were singers closelyassociated with the Rossini revival, in particular MarilynHorne, Chris Merritt, Rockwell Blake and Samuel Ramey, and afew newcomers who I hope won't be. The best was DeborahVoigt, whose ample soprano I suspect is destined for Teutoniclands, where roulades are not sung but eaten to give youplenty of strength for those endless unornamented tunes.   But if the future of Rossini singing didn't seem to behere, the past sure was, firmly embodied by Ms. Horne. WithJoan Sutherland, she made the Rossini renaissance happen whenshe opened the creaky portals to the bel canto repertoirewith her scale-bounding coloratura capers. For this we mustoffer thanks and remember great performances of the past whenshe now revisits familiar terrain with a heavier tread andoften a different key. Transposed down, Malcom's &quot;Murafelice&quot; does lose some glitter.   Even so, Ms. Horne's lower register remains plummy and hervitality seems undiminished. Ever the trooper, she cheerfullyfilled the large program hole left by June Anderson, steppingout with Tancredi's &quot;Di tanti palpiti,&quot; a once immenselypopular tune Rossini dashed off while boiling rice for fourminutes (this, like so many Rossini stories, sadly is nottrue). Where was Ms. Anderson, who looked so healthy poppingout of a recent issue of Vanity Fair? Actually quite frail,the soprano had taken ill after the gruesome &quot;Pavarotti Plus&quot;telecast a few days before the gala, at which she bravelysang a duet from &quot;Barbiere&quot; mostly by herself.   Memories of that evening, with its hypnotic parade ofwildly vocalizing guests, did leave you feeling friendlytoward the Lincoln Center Rossini fete even though it too hadits strange aspects, beginning with its unfestive hour of 3p.m. to accommodate the Philharmonic's evening concert (whichignored Rossini). Frederica von Stade, Mr. Hampson and Mr.Ramey had to lope over from the Met after finishing the&quot;Barbiere&quot; matinee, and while the double effort left Mr.Ramey undiminished in his big scene from &quot;Le Siege deCorinthe,&quot; Ms. von Stade seemed awfully tired and even Mr.Hampson wasn't at his dapper best, struggling with hiscadenza.   Still, listeners who paid up to $100 a ticket got theirmoney's worth, I suppose, with the arrival of a newly nearlyslim Mr. Merritt, bringing the most dramatic tenor sceneRossini ever wrote, Arnold's call to arms from &quot;Tell.&quot; Atonce poetic and thrilling, the tenor invested it with all thearching phrases and easy top notes one could hope to hear. Hewas wonderful, performing the aria with the finality itdeserves.   For a bundle of reasons having to do with illness,changing operatic tastes and a sizable portfolio, Rossininever wrote another opera after &quot;Tell&quot; though he was all of37. But he kept busy turning out hundreds of short piecesafter he recovered some of his mental stability and settledin Paris in 1855 with doting Olympe, his second wife. Manyare delicious little songs that friends would perform atprivate gatherings around his piano. Only slowly are theyreceiving the attention they deserve.   Ms. Horne, for instance, sang a selection in a free AliceTully Hall recital for gala ticket holders just before thegala itself, and so did Cecilia Bartoli on the previousweekend on the same stage and with the same pianist, MartinKatz. That Ms. Horne has a worthy successor in this dazzlingyoung Italian mezzo was evident in the graceful, thoughtfulway she illuminated the sunny surfaces and darker reaches ofRossini's troubled heart. Offering several examples of &quot;Milagnero tacendo&quot; -- &quot;I shall suffer mutely&quot; -- a Metastasiopoem Rossini obsessively set again and again, Ms. Bartolidrew us close into the little understood anguish of Rossini'slast years. And then she sent us home smiling with an amusingsong about a hard-boiled French cocotte that would havebrightened the composer on his gloomiest day.</TEXT></DOC>
