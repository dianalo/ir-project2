A more important long-range view is far cloudier, this oneeconomic. Yet major oil companies must plan far ahead onexpenditures of billions of dollars for petroleum explorationand refinery modernization, commitments stretching wellbeyond the current economic horizon.</LP><TEXT>   So even as earnings decline, Arco has embarked on anambitious overseas oil exploration campaign and plans majorrefinery changes.   &quot;We're trying not to yo-yo the company just because we'rein a downturn,&quot; Mr. Cook tells a visitor after anearly-morning exercise session. &quot;We don't want to cut just tomake the next few months look better.&quot;   Though it has reduced its overall U.S. work force by about7.5% because of problems in domestic natural gas markets,Arco has maintained its oil exploration and developmentbudget this year at about $1.32 billion. Moreover, it plansambitious changes to its refineries to meet newly mandatedstandards for clean gasoline.   With earnings and cash flow off of late, the company hasless financial maneuvering room than in past years, Mr. Cookconcedes. &quot;We have to manage ourselves through thisrecession, avoiding ways that damage the future,&quot; he adds.   The profit squeeze on oil companies has become even moreapparent in recent days. On Monday, Arco reported a 53%plunge in fourth-quarter profit, to $268 million, or $1.67 ashare. Revenue for the latest quarter fell 16% to $4.83billion. Other West Coast rivals were even more pressured.Chevron Corp.'s profit tumbled 94% from a year earlier. AndUnocal Corp. had a $16 million loss. Elsewhere, Exxon Corp.and Mobil Corp. recorded lower profit.   There has been &quot;a dramatic change in the operatingenvironment,&quot; Mr. Cook noted in reporting lower profit. Oilprices and particularly natural gas prices remain at lowlevels. Refining and marketing profits have narrowedsubstantially. And, though directors boosted Arco's dividendby 10% a year ago, they passed up the chance to do so againrecently.   Now, Mr. Cook, who is 63 years old, says he will stay twoyears past the company's mandatory retirement age of 65,holding the office through June 1995. &quot;There are a lot ofgood challenges out there that need continuity,&quot; he says, &quot;Ithink the board took that into account when deciding on thisplan.&quot; Not incidentally, Mr. Cook hopes to be around forbetter times. &quot;It gives us more time to get back on thatnortheast curve, which we like,&quot; he adds.   All of this is a sharp change from the recent past, whenArco posted record profit and its stock soared abovecompeting oil companies. Through the 1980s, the companygrabbed big chunks of the West's high-profit gasoline marketsand became the region's largest vendor. Its marketingstrength was balanced by the company's already formidablecrude oil advantage from its stake in the giant oil field atPrudhoe Bay in Alaska.   Long-term questions lingered about Arco's Western focusand its reliance on Alaska's now-mature oil fields. But itwas the recession and the company's lower profits thatfocused critics' attention on the company's long-termproblems.   Even in tough economic times, Arco needs to pursue plansit made a while ago to improve both refining and marketingoperations and to assure crude supplies for the last part ofthis decade and beyond.   Arco must spend $800 million on its Los Angeles-arearefinery alone, modernizing it to make the cleaner gasolinethat will be required by California regulations in 1996. Arcohas committed hundreds of millions of dollars to sustainingoil production at Prudhoe Bay. But perhaps most important tothe company's continued success, billions of dollars morewill be poured into exploring for oil to replacenow-dwindling Alaskan production.   These projects call for total corporate outlays of between$2.5 billion and $3 billion a year at least for the nextseveral years, Mr. Cook says. That is somewhat higher thanthe $2.4 billion total it plans to spend this yearcorporatewide, including not only exploration and developmentbut also refining and marketing.   &quot;We're doing all the things we're supposed to be doing --thinking and planning long term,&quot; says Mr. Cook. But takingthe long view can be painful in the short run, and thus theirony of Arco's plight.   Arco has taken a beating from investors, who have sent theonce-favored oil stock sliding about 9.6% in the past threemonths, a drop nearly three times steeper than its peers, onaverage. Arco shares were quoted at $108.125, down $2.375 inlate New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.   Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.both recently considered downgrading the company's debt.Though Moody's left its single-A-1 rating on Arco's $5.6billion in long-term debt, Standard andamp; Poor's downgraded thecorporate paper a notch, to single-A-1, its second-highestgrade.   &quot;Atlantic Richfield will walk a tight financial line overthe next few years,&quot; Salomon Brothers analyst Bernard J.Picchi predicted recently, adding that, after the company'sbig projects, &quot;excess cash will not be very great.&quot;   Arco has carried a more heavily leveraged balance sheetthan most other oil companies for some years. Debt at Sept.30 made up about 47% of its overall capital, nearly twice theindustry average of about 24%. &quot;There's no question thatwe're more leveraged than some of our competitors,&quot; saysArco's chairman. &quot;We feel comfortable there; this isn't atime to grow.&quot;   Leverage, says Mr. Cook, is part of Arco's tradition. &quot;Welike to feel under pressure,&quot; he adds. Indeed, in the 1970's,as it financed a sizable chunk of development of the PrudhoeBay oil field and the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline System,Arco's balance sheet was burdened with loans. But, whenoperations started and cash poured in, debt dropped to 25% orso of overall capital. Then, in 1985, Arco nearly doubled itsdebt in a single stroke by borrowing billions of dollars tobuy back about a quarter of its shares.   Analysts often have taken Arco to task even in the best oftimes. &quot;Not long ago, everyone was worried that we would makea huge acquisition; now the complaint is that we have toomuch debt,&quot; Mr. Cook grouses. &quot;It seems that analysts alwaysneed something to worry about.&quot;   Other major oil companies suffer a similar &quot;Catch 22,&quot;notes William H. Brown III, analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.Big companies, he says, have big needs. While a single oildiscovery may mean a huge jump in reserves for a smallcompany, major companies' oil reserves are so big that asingle roll of the dice won't do. Instead, it takes manysuccesses to make meaningful additions. &quot;There just has to bea minimum maintenance level of exploration spending,&quot; saysMr. Brown. So major oil companies haven't yet slashed capitaloutlays.   At the same time, there isn't much opportunity forday-to-day cost-cutting. As oil prices tumbled in the 1980s,producers slashed overhead and employment, cutting costs longbefore the recession hit. &quot;These companies are reaching theirterminal cost reductions -- unless they sell assets orseverely reduce operations,&quot; Mr. Brown says.   That could be in the cards for Arco. Although Mr. Cookthinks his company's course is set and is reluctant to &quot;jerkthe company around,&quot; he adds quickly: &quot;If we find ourselvesat the end of this year, and things haven't evolved as weanticipated, then we'll adjust.&quot;   ---                    Arco by the Numbers                                                                                                                            The Fundamentals                                                                                                                                             1991         1990                                                                                                          Sales ($ millions) ..........    $18,157      $18,808   Net Income ($ millions) .....       $709       $2,011   Earnings Per Share ..........      $4.39       $12.15                                                                                                          Major Product Lines: Gasoline and other refined petroleumproducts, natural gas, chemicals and coal                                                                                                          Major Competitors: Chevron Corp. and Unocal Corp. forgasoline marketing, other major oil companies around theworld for crude oil and natural gas</TEXT></DOC>
