COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Immigrant schoolchildren are hampered by rigidplacement practices, lack of bilingual education, culturalinsensitivity, harassment from other students and fear ofdeportation, a new study says.   Such children often are placed in classes for the handicapped orat inappropriate grade levels because schools can't cope with theircultural differences, according to the study released Wednesday.   This is true even though ``the education level of many newimmigrants ... is superior to that of previous migrations'' andsometimes exceeds that of Americans, added the 129-page study,titled ``New Voices: Immigrant Students in the U.S. PublicSchools.''   The study was conducted by the Boston-based National Coalitionof Advocates for Students and funded largely by the Ford Foundation.   The Supreme Court has ruled that all school-age immigrants areentitled to an education, regardless of whether they are herelegally, the study noted.   About 6.6 million people immigrated to the United States in the1970s, more than two-thirds of them legally, forming one of thelargest migrations in U.S. history and one that is continuing, thestudy said.   Newcomers arriving now are primarily from Asia, Mexico, Centraland South America and the Caribbean, it said. Immigrant children,who number up to 2.7 million, comprise about 6 percent of totalU.S. public school enrollment.   After conducting public hearings in six ``gateway cities'' forimmigrants and after interviewing parents and educators across thecountry, researchers reported that schools are doing a poor job ofmeeting immigrant students' needs.   Some areas of the country are fostering an ``English Only'' or``English First'' movement, undercutting public funding foreducational programs serving students who speak little or noEnglish, the study said.   The movement ``sends a clear message to newcomers that theirlanguages and cultures are unwelcome and inferior _ a point of viewwhich ill prepares this country for the realities of its domesticand international future,'' it said.   Dropout rates for immigrant students are high, suicide attemptsare all too frequent and some young newcomers under extremepressure have responded by forming gangs for emotional and physicalprotection, the study found.   Though the study could provide no figures on how often immigrantchildren are misclassified into special education programs withphysically and mentally handicapped youngsters, it apparently hashappened frequently, the authors said.   As far back as 1916, special classes ``frequently served as aneasy means of disposing of a (non-English speaking) pupil who,through no fault of his own, is an unsatisfactory member of aregular class,'' the study said.   Reine Leroy, an intergrou relations representative from DadeCounty, Fla., told the researchers, ``Teachers thought that thesekids were dumb, that they could not learn.''   The study suggested restructuring public schools to betterassess immigrant students for placement in appropriate grades,boosting the quality of bilingual education and providingcounseling and support geared specifically to immigrants.</TEXT></DOC>
