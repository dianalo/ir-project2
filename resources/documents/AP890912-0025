Sois hair down to there. And though they don't necessarily have todress for success, some say they must dress under duress.   Along with perpetual peer pressure to wear ``in'' clothes andsport the latest trendy haircuts _ whether it's a Batman insignia ora moussed-up do _ American teen-agers are facing dress and haircodes that impose official ideas of fashion.   In a flashback to the '60s, some students are protesting whatthey consider infringements on their right to free expression.   ``It's very regrettable when educators fail to see that kids haverights and that breathing down their necks about ways they should beable to express themselves is not encouraging real education,'' saidLeanne Kats, executive director of the National Coalition AgainstCensorship.   In Henry County, Ga., for example, about 100 students picketedthe school superintendent's office last month when dozens of boyswere sent home because their hair touched the collar in violation ofa new policy.   The same rule in Jasper, Ala., resulted in an angry school boardmeeting.   Shelia Whitfield, whose son Duane, a 10th-grader, was sent homebecause his hair is an inch longer than allowed, complained the rulewas an invasion of privacy.   ``His hair doesn't have anything to do with his education,'' Mrs.Whitfield said.   New dress codes are in effect in several Texas school systems,mostly to guard against offensive or suggestive T-shirts, and inBaltimore, where furs, costly jewelry and leather coats were banned.   Dozens of other systems, including some in Michigan, New York andLouisiana, have adopted voluntary dress codes for their schools toconsider.   Gary Marx, a spokesman for the American Association of SchoolAdministrators, said stricter dress and hair codes have not yetbecome a national trend but sentiment is growing to strengthen suchrules.   ``We do see indications here and there that schools are thinkingabout dress codes and how students are attired may affect theireducation and the education of others,'' Marx said. ``I think thereis a sense in society that we sometimes act the way we look.''   Lawrence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor whospecializes in First Amendment issues, said the U.S. Supreme Courthas never dealt directly with the issue and the lower federal courtshave ruled both ways.   The high court would likely side with school boards if it ruledtoday, he said.   ``I think it stretches the free expression clause to apply it inschools,'' Tribe said. ``The power of compulsory education alreadyinvolves a major intrusion into a person's ability to expresshimself. The school board has a broad range of powers over itsstudents.''   In Baltimore, schools' spokesman Dick Holden said the new codewas aimed at eliminating ``the uniform of the drug culture.'' Hesaid the clothes also are too expensive for some students to afford,leading to violence.   ``The dress code became a major topic of discussion after someviolent incidents in our schools involving outsiders stealing, orattempting to steal, jackets or jewelry of our students,'' Holdensaid. ``Clothing had become attractions to criminal activity.''   The New Orleans school board instituted a voluntary uniformpolicy for schools, and spokeswoman Rose Peterson said about 100schools have ``adopted some kind of uniform.''   She cited three reasons: ``It's a security issue. When theschools are wearing a uniform, it's easy to recognize an outsider.For the parents, they perceive it as a lot cheaper. And it takes thepressure off kids to wear designer clothes.''   In Clovis, N.M., a one-year trial dress code is in effect afterstudents rewrote an old one that banned shorts for boys but allowedminiskirts for girls. In protest, some boys wore miniskirts toschool.   The new policy allows shorts and skirts if neither is shorterthan 5 inches above the knee.   And in San Antonio, a 13-year-old student was forced to get ridof two Batman emblems emblazoned on each side of his head withbleach. Officials banned him from class until he came back with aflattop.   Among students, though, opinions can be divided.   Many see the restrictions as arbitrary, and others worry thatsome adults assume a given style of dress means a student is takingdrugs or involved in illegal activity.   Still others, including student body President Jason Thompson ofAllen High School in Dallas, support policies encouraging neatappearance.   ``Fads come and go,'' Thompson said. ``Last year, when studearrings were allowed for the first time, almost everyone went outand got his ear pierced. But now you don't see earrings that much.''</TEXT></DOC>
