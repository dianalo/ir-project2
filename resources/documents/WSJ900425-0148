Craig Fields, director of the $1.1 billion DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), was transferredlast week after his latest spat with Deputy Secretary ofDefense Donald Atwood. While the trigger was ostensibly onecontroversial investment, the dispute actually goes to theheart of the debate about U.S. &quot;industrial policy.&quot; Somewhereduring his 16-year career, Mr. Fields joined the crowd thatbelieves that a main Pentagon purpose is to nurture certainU.S. commercial interests. Since this is neither Bush policynor in the American tradition, Mr. Fields was bound to lose.</LP><TEXT>   That said, Mr. Fields has done an enormous amount of goodin an underappreciated area of U.S. defense-technologyresearch. His judgment delivered seed money for suchhigh-risk technologies as artificial intelligence (computersthat perform tasks analogous to human intelligence),parallel-processing computers and semiconductors that usegallium arsenide instead of silicon (and promise fasterprocessing speeds as well as protection against nuclear-blastradiation). He also financed the ideas of Carver Mead, theCaltech scientist and guru of America's computer industry.   Yet in the past year or so, Mr. Fields had begun to havelarger dreams for DARPA. He became a favorite of those onCapitol Hill and in U.S. industry who sought an expanded&quot;commercial DARPA&quot; for private industry. It wasn't enough toboost futuristic technologies that couldn't find privatefinancing. He wanted the government to subsidize the U.S.electronics industry -- for example, the $100 million subsidyfor Sematech, the federal computer-chip concern, andhigh-definition TV.   In a letter last August to the planners at the CommerceDepartment, Mr. Fields more or less endorsed a Japan-styleindustrial policy for the U.S. &quot;We need a national religiousconversion,&quot; he wrote, because &quot;the American way&quot; was nolonger good enough against the planners of East Asia. He alsotook a swipe at &quot;highly placed individuals who think nothingis wrong,&quot; presumably senior White House aides who stillbelieve in such notions as free markets.   Now, we understand that the line between &quot;seed money&quot; andindustrial policy can be muddy. The national defense is acommon good that requires the collective effort marshaled bygovernment. Since technology is critical to American defense,it makes sense for the Pentagon to spend liberally on Randamp;D.Some technologies are so speculative that the private sectoris reluctant to support them. Even as total defense spendingdeclines, Randamp;D spending should increase, as a hedge againstfuture uncertainty.   Yet the government crosses the line when it undertakes thewholesale subsidy of industry. We're still waiting to hearwhy Sematech is needed in a world with dozens ofcomputer-chip makers. High-definition display screens mayhave their defense uses, but that doesn't mean the fedsshould get into the home-TV business.   The &quot;commercial DARPA&quot; proposed by Senator John Glennwould undermine precisely the kind of far-out but promisingdefense research that Mr. Fields spent his career supporting.Pentagon research spending would become another politicalhoney pot micromanaged by Congress. Lobbyists for existingindustry would defeat the future every time.   In fact, just yesterday 11 Members of Congress fired off aletter demanding that Mr. Fields be reinstated. The entireindustrial-policy crowd signed up -- Reps. Mel Levine, DickGephardt, Don Ritter, Helen Bentley, Ed Markey, and SenatorsAl Gore and John Heinz.   Mr. Fields has also seemed unduly worried about Japan. Ina world where information travels at lightning speed, itisn't possible for Americans to lead in every technology.Instead of trying to make everything at home, a better (andmore plausible) national-security strategy is to sharetechnology with the likes of Japan. If the Japanese steal alead in gallium arsenide or ceramics, it makes more sense toshare than to duplicate. In any case, paranoia sends exactlythe wrong message.   We'd like to see Mr. Fields find some spot at thePentagon, because his defense dreams have served his countrywell. It's his larger dreams we worry about, just as wecontinue to worry about the people who want to make theprivate economy's best minds partners with the same peoplewho helped the Sandamp;L industry become what it is today.</TEXT></DOC>
