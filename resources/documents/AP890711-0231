Chase stood alone Monday in trimming its key lending rate a halfpercentage point to 10.5 percent.   ``I'm a little surprised that the other banks did not come inwith a similar decision,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financialeconomist for Nikko Securities Co. International. ``I suspect somekey people who probably make these decisions are probably onvacation.''   But Brusca predicted others would soon follow suit this week,even as early as today.   The prime, which usually lags behind other interest rates, is therate banks charge customers with the best credit ratings. It also isthe benchmark rate used to set interest on a variety of consumer andbusiness credit, including home-equity lines of credit.   It stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. Banks raised ittwice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a half percentagepoint on June 5. Those movements reflected changing concerns abouteconomic growth and inflation.   Economists have been predicting another prime-rate drop as theFederal Reserve Board shows more signs of loosening its creditpolicies in response to a slowdown in economic growth and easing ofinflation.   Last week, the federal funds rates, the market rate of which theFed has direct control, dipped as low as 8~ percent after hoveringat around 9{ percent. The federal funds rate is what banks chargeeach other for overnight loans.   Other credit market rates also have been falling steadily inrecent weeks. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, for instance,has tumbled to about 8 percent, its lowest level in more than twoyears. And 30-year fixed mortgage rates also have fallen, droppinglast week to an average 10.17 percent, a 14-month low, according toHSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage reserach firm.   Saving rates also have slipped, with the average yield on thesix-month certificate of deposit down to 8.79 percent last week fromfrom 8.84 percent the previous week.   Bond and stock prices rose moderatly following Chase'sannouncement Monday, while the dollar was little changed to slightlylower.   Chase said it lowered its prime rate because its cost ofborrowing money, including interest it pays on savings accounts orCDs, had declined.   Last week, one small bank, Southwest Bank in St. Louis, cut itsprime rate to 10.5 percent from 11 percent. But since then, no majorbank but Chase has taken similar action.   Although it's not unusual for one or two banks to adjust theirprime rates without others immediately following, major banks haveessentially worked in harmony in recent years.   For example, Citibank and Chase raised their prime to 7.75percent from 7.5 percent on March 31, 1987, a day before other majorbanks started following suit.   The last time Chase went solo was on Dec. 28, 1983, when itlowered the prime to 11 percent from 11.5 percent. Other banks tooksimilar action two weeks later.   ``We made an independent judgement,'' Chase spokesman FraserSeitel said of Monday's move. ``What we base our decisions on asmuch as anything else is the level of the cost of funds and marketrates, and at this particular level 10.5 percent is clearly theappropriate rate.''   While most economists predicted that interest rates wouldcontinue to decline through early next year, some said the lowerrates would do little to spur the economy, other than give thesagging housing market a lift.   ``I see it as more of a way of preventing a recession thanboosting economic growth,'' said Carol A. Stone, a senior economistNomura Securities Inc. ``We've just been on a three-to-four yearbuying surge and I think a lot of peole are saying, `I have my VCRand my camcorder and other durable goods.' There's not a lot of pentup demand here.''</TEXT></DOC>
