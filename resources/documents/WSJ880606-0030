In industrial countries the population is growing slowly and aging rapidly; in developing countries -- China excepted -- the population is growing fast enough to double in less than a generation, and 40% of the people are under age 15.    These divergent trends -- and the way nations respond to them -- will have a profound impact on immigration patterns, the world economic order and the U.S. position in the world.    At current growth rates, over the next 20 years the work force in Third World countries will expand by about 700 million -- an increase approximately equal to today's labor force in industrial countries. Mexico, Egypt and many other countries won't generate enough jobs to employ the new workers; wages will remain depressed and the potential for economic and political instability will rise.    The surge in the Third World labor force will come at a time when the population of young workers in many industrial countries, including the U.S., is stagnant or declining, creating pressure for the migration of people to developed countries and for the migration of investment and technology to countries with growing populations and low wages.    The Committee for Economic Development, a non-partisan, business-supported research organization, has launched an ambitious study of the public implications of demographic trends. &quot;As additional countries learn to apply the technology of the industrial world, populous regions of the Third World can be expected to increase their overall weight in international affairs,&quot; a draft of the CED study notes. &quot;For the U.S. to continue to exercise its accustomed international role will likely require a far higher commitment of resources to foreign affairs and economic investment, precisely at the time when the cost of supporting its elderly population soars.&quot;    The 77 million American Baby Boomers will begin to turn 65 in 2010, and as they do the share of the population over 65 will climb to 21% in 2030 from about 12% today.    The CED study raises an important issue: &quot;Whether a progressively aging American population, confronted with increasingly vigorous and technically skilled populations abroad, will engage that world or draw steadily back into itself, expressing a preference for relative comfort and security, and consumption over investment.&quot;    One problem with demographic projections is that they don't convey much urgency; it's easy to disregard projected problems that -- if they develop at all -- won't occur for 30 or 40 years. But the next millennium isn't incomprehensibly distant. A child who starts first grade this fall will graduate from high school in the year 2000; a student graduating from college this month will be contemplating retirement in 2030.    As the U.S. looks to the future, it has ample time and resources to adjust -- if it makes the right choices. The CED points out that measures to increase productivity today will ease the burden of a shrinking work force tomorrow. Policies to trim the budget deficit and promote greater national savings will make it easier to finance the Baby Boom's retirement.    A sensible immigration policy will help the U.S. build the human capital it needs to sustain growth. Last year 601,516 legal immigrants entered the U.S. -- probably more immigrants than all the other countries in the world accepted. But as the work force declines, the need for immigrants will rise.    Relative to the rest of the world, America's economic and military strength has declined over the last two decades, and the U.S. will continue to face economic challenges, not only from Japan but from industrializing countries such as Brazil and India. No country can claim to match the U.S. combination of military power, economic strength and diversity, but the growing Third World and the static population of the developed nations suggest a changing center of gravity in a world that's already more pluralistic and turbulent.    The risk, warns the CED, is that an aging America could produce &quot;a national outlook relatively less concerned with innovation, investment and looking to the future&quot; at exactly the time when these qualities are most necessary.    ---                    World Population Growth                         (In Billions)                                  1988           2020                               (Estimate)     (Projected)    Asia and Oceanea             3.021          4.665    Africa                       0.623          1.497    Europe                       0.497          0.499    Latin America                0.429          0.711    Soviet Union                 0.286          0.354    U.S., Canada                 0.272          0.327 -   Source: Population Reference Bureau, Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
