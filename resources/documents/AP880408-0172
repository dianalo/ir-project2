Strict laws bar private adoption agencies.   ``We are completely legal,'' Uwe Hamel, 32, told The AssociatedPress. ``All we are doing is breaking through the monopoly ofstate-run offices that put couples wanting to adopt through thetorture of long waits and tests before they get a child.''   To circumvent the adoption law, Hamel says, a prospectiveadoptive father declares himself the father of an illegitimatechild and signs a contract with the baby's mother, who is paid toverify his claim.   The adoptive father then applies to a West German court for thechild to be declared his legitimate offspring, Hamel said.   Hamel said he makes about $3,000 as the go-between, with therest of the fee going to the mother.   ``There is nothing in our law that forbids this,'' he said.   The agency sends its advertising fliers to prospective adoptiveparents and gynecologists.   ``I can arrange immediately for a child. The prices: 30,000marks ($18,000) for a child from the Middle East; 15,000 marks($9,000) for a child from the Far East; 45,000 marks ($27,000) fora German child,'' one flier said.   Frankfurt city officials are working to shut down Hamel's office``because it is morally and ethically wrong to profit by sellinghuman beings,'' city spokesman Stefan Lauer told the AP.   Last year, Frankfurt won a court order to shut down UnitedFamilies International, an information office for the InfertilityCenter of Michigan, Inc.   The Michigan office is operated by American lawyer Noel P.Keane, who gained fame in the ``Baby M'' surrogate motherhood case.   ``We closed down the Keane office last year, and in this case wealso think it is morally and ethically wrong to make a profit bytrading in children,'' Lauer said.   The case has been getting heavy publicity.   The Frankfurter Rundschau published an article about Hamel'soperation under the headline, ``Businessman Deals in Babies fromthe Third World.''   The Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper wrote: ``Frankfurt OfficeTakes Advantage of Law's Loopholes for Scandalous Baby Trade.''   Different prices does not mean the agency considers one babymore valuable than another because of race, Hamel said.   ``In West Germany a mother is entitled to as much as 2,000 marks($1,480) per month to support herself and a child.   ``A Third World mother can often support herself and a baby forabout 200 marks ($120) per month, depending on which country she'sfrom,'' he added.   Hamel said he has so far arranged the adoption of nine babies.His office has been operating for two months.</TEXT></DOC>
