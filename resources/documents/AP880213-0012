U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker on Friday dismissedthree charges against Younis, but refused to dismiss six conspiracyand hijacking counts of the indictment.   Each of the three charges Parker dismissed carried potential20-year sentences and fines of up to $100,000. The hijackingcharges still pending against Younis carry life sentences.   Parker ruled that the Aircraft Piracy Act of 1984 provided nojurisdiction for U.S. authorities to prosecute Younis for thebombing of the ALIA jetliner . The plane was blown up at BeirutInternational Airport after the passengers aboard the aircraft hadbeen released.   The judge ruled, however, that the Justice Department did havejurisdiction to prosecute Younis on the six other charges ofconspiracy and hijacking under the Hostage Taking Act, also passedby Congress in 1984 as part of a legislative package to combatterrorism. The hijacking happened June 11.   That law gives U.S. authorities jurisdiction because threeAmericans were aboard the flight when it was stormed in Beirut by agroup of armed men carrying assault rifles and submachine guns,Parker said.   ``There is no dispute that the only nexus to the United Stateswas the presence of several American nationals on board theflight,'' Parker said. ``The airplane was registered in Jordan,flew the Jordanian flag and never landed on American soil or flewover American airspace.''   The judge said the government didn't have jurisdiction toprosecute Younis on charges of placing a destructive device aboardthe plane, destroying the plane and assaulting the passengersbecause ``the ALIA flight had no connection whatsoever with UnitedStates territory   The judge refused to dismiss the six conspiracy and hijackingcounts of the indictment and upheld the use of Navy vessels thattransported Younis following his arrest aboard an FBI-charteredyacht last Sept. 13 in the Mediterranean.   Younis, who later told the FBI that Lebanaon's Justice MinisterNabih Berri approved the hijacking, was lured aboard the yacht bythe prospect of making a drug deal, authorities said.</TEXT></DOC>
