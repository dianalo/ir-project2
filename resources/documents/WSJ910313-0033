Energy Secretary James Watkins seized on the study as anew rationale for opening up to oil exploration a1.5-million-acre portion of the refuge on the state'snortheast coast.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Watkins told a Senate panel that President Bush likelywould veto any comprehensive energy-policy legislation unlessit authorizes drilling in the reserve, which could hold 3.6billion barrels of oil or more. &quot;I think it's thatimportant,&quot; he said. Strong opposition by environmentalistshas blocked oil-drilling in the reserve to date.   According to the study, the 800-mile pipeline carrying oilto the port of Valdez likely will have to be shut down by theyear 2009 unless Congress authorizes oil leasing in thereserve within the next six or seven years. That's becauseproduction from Alaska's North Slope, and particularly fromthe huge Prudhoe Bay field, will have fallen to such lowlevels -- 300,000 barrels a day -- that the pipeline couldn'toperate technically and economically. It would take 12 yearsto produce oil from the wildlife refuge once leases are madeto oil companies. If the pipeline is shut, the studyconcluded, one billion barrels of oil from already-producingfields would be locked in the ground because it couldn't betransported. Moreover, the huge potential for oil in theArctic National Wildlife Refuge might never be exploredbecause oil drillers could find it prohibitively expensive toreopen the pipeline.   &quot;The new fields most likely would have to pay for themaintenance costs of the pipeline during its shutdown alongwith normal tariff costs,&quot; a summary of the study stated.&quot;This could push the cost of the oil too high to makesignificant new production worthwhile.&quot; The study didn'tdisclose any figures or the economic assumptions behind itsconclusion. An official said the estimates involvedproprietary information.   If the reserve is drilled and as much oil as expected isfound, it would supply the U.S. with a new source of domesticoil that would prolong the life of the pipeline from nine to16 years, the study estimated. Alaska now accounts for aquarter of U.S. domestic oil production.   Drilling in the Alaskan reserve, which faces considerableenvironmental opposition on Capitol Hill, is the biggestissue that Congress must grapple with in trying to assemble anational energy policy in the wake of the Persian Gulf war.   Even if Congress breaks its years-long stalemate andauthorizes oil exploration in the reserve, the energy agencystudy said environmental roadblocks, including the Bushadministration's goal of &quot;no-net-loss&quot; of wetlands, stillwould stop development of much of Alaska's North Slope.</TEXT></DOC>
