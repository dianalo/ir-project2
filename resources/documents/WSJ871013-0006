FreedbergStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABOR </IN><TEXT>   A jury in Dade City, Fla., recently found Lykes Pasco Inc., a juice processor, guilty of age discrimination when it fired Malcolm Anderson, a 59-year-old worker with 30 years of service. The jurors awarded Mr. Anderson $196,940 -- about 10 times his final annual salary.    Whatever the merits of Mr. Anderson's case (the company is appealing), the outcome was typical in one respect: When juries hear age-discrimination lawsuits, the odds favor the worker.    &quot;It's very hard to convince a jury that a nice, white-haired man who lost his job after 20 years doesn't deserve something against the big, bad corporation,&quot; says Larry Besnoff, a management lawyer in Philadelphia.    Age discrimination is the fastest-growing type of bias charge in the workplace. Last year, almost 27,000 complaints were lodged with federal and state agencies -- more than twice the number filed in 1980. Although many cases never reach court, the occasional blockbuster settlement &quot;puts the fear of God in lots of managers,&quot; says J. Robert Kirk, a Washington-based management lawyer.    While some areas of the law are still being mapped, enough cases have moved through the courts to give lawyers and personnel specialists a good idea of what constitutes age discrimination -- and what does and doesn't work in pursuing or fighting such charges.    An individual who is pressing a lawsuit, for example, probably wants a jury trial; a company defending against such a suit probably wants a judge. Companies can still fire older workers, as long as age itself isn't a reason. But even casual asides -- such as a boss referring to an employee as &quot;the old man&quot; -- can be proof of discrimination. Companies sometimes lose suits because they can't document that an employee's work justified dismissal. But even with good personnel records, cases often boil down to credibility contests.    &quot;You can trot out every statistic and business explanation in the book, but if a jury thinks an older worker has been treated unfairly, they won't listen,&quot; says Jack G. Knebel, a lawyer for Miles Inc. In August, a San Francisco jury ordered the company to pay $1.63 million to nine older workers who had been dismissed in a companywide layoff. Miles, maker of Alka Seltzer, is asking for a new trial.    --THE LAW. In the area of civil rights, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act is a &quot;favored statute&quot; among employees and their lawyers, says Paul Brenner, a staff lawyer for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That's because the age act, unlike most other civil-rights statutes, allows jury trials as well as double damages for workers who prove &quot;willful&quot; discrimination by an employer.    Congress passed the law in 1967, preventing employers from using age as a basis for hiring or firing people ages 40 to 65. In 1978, the age cap was lifted to 70. Last year, Congress eliminated the cap for most occupations. About one-third of the states have passed companion measures that restrict mandatory retirement.    Litigants typically start by filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or its state counterpart. Such agencies can file a lawsuit on behalf of an employee, but their staffs are often bogged down. Thus, most workers simply go to court themselves.    --WHO SUES? The typical age-bias litigant is a white male supervisor in his 50s who was discharged in a corporate belt-tightening. A recent study by Syracuse University School of Management, which reviewed more than 10,000 age-discrimination claims, says the average litigant sees a lawsuit as his only refuge; he has no union to represent him and can't qualify for racial or sexual discrimination.    A majority of the complaints, the study says, originate in right-to-work states outside the Northeast, where employers &quot;may be more aggressive in discharging or forcing the retirement of older workers.&quot;    Last year, a fourth of the court actions filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission fell under the age act. Raymond C. Fay, a Washington lawyer specializing in discrimination cases, attributes the rise in complaints to heightened public awareness of the law and the growing numbers of workers covered by it.    --IN COURT. Only about one age-discrimination case in five makes it to a jury. &quot;A lot of these complaints ought not to be in court,&quot; says Christopher S. Miller, an Atlanta lawyer who co-authored the Syracuse study. &quot;They're straight grievance claims by older workers who were the unfortunate victims of companies that were forced to cut back.&quot;    The Syracuse study says judges rule for companies about two-thirds of the time, not including those cases decided on procedural issues. Conversely, Mr. Miller says, juries side with older workers about two-thirds of the time. Says San Francisco management lawyer Victor Schachter, &quot;Juries are inherently biased in favor of long-term employees who work for deep-pocket companies.&quot;    --RAVE REVIEWS. To avoid age-bias lawsuits, management specialists caution companies to avoid inflating performance appraisals and to ensure a thorough, accurate paper trail for each employee.    Such reviews played a role in the recent judgment against Miles, which merged with Cutter Laboratories Inc. in 1983 and inherited age-bias charges. At the trial in August, Miles argued that $60 million in losses prompted Cutter to lay off 1,200 workers in 1982 and that it picked the least productive employees with the worst sales records. But the nine workers who sued claimed that the company's standards were biased against workers over 40, and their lawyer produced records showing that they had received glowing performance evaluations over the years.    The six-member District Court jury -- all but one over 40 years old -- believed the salespeople. What's more, the jury found the discrimination &quot;willful&quot; and awarded double damages -- $1.63 million.    --WHAT TO DO? Any hiring or firing decision in which age has crept into the process is suspect under the law.    A company can be held liable, for instance, if an age-neutral layoff policy ends up having a disproportionate effect on older workers. An employer could also have trouble in court for involuntarily transferring an older worker who performs at a minimally acceptable level. And a company can lose a lawsuit simply on the basis of a seemingly harmless aside. In the case of Lykes Pasco, a subsidiary of Tampa, Fla.-based Lykes Bros. Inc., two secretaries testified that two executives called Mr. Anderson &quot;the old man&quot; and &quot;too darned old.&quot; (The executives denied it.) In the Miles-Cutter case, a manager allegedly commented that he preferred salespeople in their 20s. (The manager denied it.)    &quot;Remarks like, 'We need new blood,' can be the kiss of death for a company defending against an age-bias claim,&quot; says Mr. Miller, the Atlanta lawyer.    Even a company's manuals and forms can cause trouble if they reflect any age bias. Some businesses, for example, have decided to remove the &quot;Date of Birth&quot; box from their job-application forms and have stopped asking what year an applicant graduated from high school or college.    --GOLDEN HANDCUFFS. To thwart lawsuits, some companies are starting to ask retiring employees to sign notarized releases waiving all age-discrimination claims. Some lawyers, however, debate the validity of such releases. Last year in Cincinnati, a federal appeals court overturned a decision that had declared such a release illegal. The employee who had signed the release was a lawyer for NCR Corp.    --COMING ATTRACTIONS. The current interest in age discrimination, lawyers say, may be nothing compared to what lies ahead. By the year 2010, people age 40 or over -- those protected by the law -- are expected to make up half the work force. More older people with medical handicaps are likely to file suit, alleging both age and handicap bias. &quot;More older women and more older blacks will be contending for the same jobs held by older white men,&quot; says Mr. Miller.    As more companies seek ways to streamline aging work forces, new age-discrimination issues are likely to crop up in court: When does a &quot;voluntary&quot; early-retirement plan become subtly coercive? Can a company fire an older, higher-salaried worker to save money? And is the fast-track method of management -- in which younger &quot;bright stars&quot; are transferred from department to department to broaden their experience -- legal?    ---                A Profile of Litigation   An analysis of 280 federal court cases involving claimsunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act showed that: -- 84% were filed by white males -- 68% dealt with an employee's dismissal or involuntaryretirement -- 59% were filed by managerial and professional employees -- 54% were filed by employees between the ages of 50 and 59   Source: Syracuse University American Association ofRetired Persons</TEXT></DOC>
