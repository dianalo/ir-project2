Richard H. Ayers, president and chief executive officer, said the sale reflects Stanley's intention to focus on products and tools for the do-it-yourself and professional building market.    The businesses, which will be sold to Cold Metal Products Co., a private concern in Youngstown, Ohio, have been treated as discontinued operations. The businesses make precision, cold-rolled strip steel and strapping products for the packaging industry.    Stanley Works still is seeking to sell another business, a producer of pre-cast concrete structures. Mr. Ayers said the remaining divestiture is expected to be completed this year. </TEXT></DOC>
