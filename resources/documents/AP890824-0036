LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government said it is investigating reportsthat Israelis trained assassination squads for drug traffickers inColombia.   One source told The Associated Press that two such mercenarieswere smuggled out of Colombia after the nation's leadingpresidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, was gunned downFriday at a political rally. Drug traffickers were blamed for theslaying.   The source spoke to The Associated Press on condition ofanonymity. He has close ties to Israel's Defense Department and wasinvolved in an Israeli TV report.   The Foreign Ministry said the government was investigatingwhether Israelis were training hit squads for the notorious Medellindrug cartel.   The Israeli government said any citizens involved were acting ontheir own illegally, but critics said the actions still could damageIsrael's interests.   ``It blemishes Israel,'' said Amnon Rubinstein, leader of theleft-wing Shinui Party.   An NBC News report Tuesday included film purportedly showingIsraelis during training sessions. The film also was shown onIsraeli television.   Israel TV said the man in the NBC film was identified by Israeliweapons dealers in Colombia.   It said Colombia's secret service ordered the weapons dealers totell all Israeli army experts involved in training forces for drugcartels to leave the country immediately after Galan's slaying.   Shortly after the warning, ``a number of Israelis ... werehurriedly smuggled from the country,'' the television said.   The Itim news agency also reported Israeli mercenaries werespirited out of Colombia after the killing.   Israeli TV identified three colonels in Israel's military reserveit said were involved in Colombia: Yair Klein, Avraham Tzadaka andYaakov Brine.   In the NBC film, one man pictured in a group wearing fatiguescould be heard saying in Hebrew that it was a ``good exercise'' andeverything went well.   Israel television identified that man as Klein.   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kleincommanded the Israeli paratrooper's anti-terror unit in 1983. Hesaid Klein traveled to Colombia in 1985, where he set up a securitycompany called Hod Hahanit, or Glory of the Spear.   The television said a spokesman for Hod Hahanit would not say ifit was Klein who appeared in the broadcast or if he was involved intraining paramilitary forces in Colombia.   It said Hod Hahanit employs several high-ranking Israeliofficers, including three other reserve colonels.   The television identified them as Tzadaka, a former paratroopcommander; Brine, a helicopter expert formerly with the air force;and a third reserve colonel, not named, who had commanded a tankbrigade.   One Israeli source, insisting on anonymity, said the UnitedStates had asked Israel to look into the role of its citizens.   The Foreign Ministry said any involvement by Israelis wouldinvolve ``individuals who are acting on their own ... in violationof Israeli law and contrary to Israeli policy, which is stronglycommitted to the war on drugs.''   Cmdr. Yehoshua Caspi, investigations chief for the NationalPolice, requested that Colombia provide Israel with any informationon drug-related activities of Israeli citizens.   Rubinstein said Israel could block such mercenaries through a lawthat forbids ex-soldiers from using their military training abroadwithout Defense Ministry approval.   Benny Tal, head of a security company with clients overseas, saidIsraelis with military skills often are lured by the lucrative payof mercenary work.</TEXT></DOC>
