As most of the nation savored its first hours of unity andsovereignty after nightlong celebrations, leftist radicalsprotesting unification rampaged in Berlin. Police fired tear gasand water cannons in street battles, and about 50 people werearrested.   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, widely credited with makingunification possible, will visit Germany next month, a governmentspokemsan said Wednesday. A hero's welcome is expected.   In a message to governments worldwide, Chancellor Helmut Kohlpledged Germany would never again pose the territorial claims thatmarked Germany from its initial unification in 1871 to its defeatand division in World War II.   ``In the future, only peace will emanate from German soil,''Kohl said.   ``At the same time, we stand by our moral and legalresponsibilities that arise from German history,'' Kohl added. Thatwas a reference to the Nazi past and the Holocaust, which claimedthe lives of 6 million Jews.   President Richard von Weizsaecker raised the same themes in hisspeech at the ceremony in Berlin's Philharmonic hall.   ``The Nazi terror and the war it caused inflicted untold seriousinjustice and suffering on almost all of Europe and on us,'' hesaid. ``We continuously recall the victims.''   Among the several hundred invited guests was Heinz Galinski, anAuschwitz death camp survivor and now the leader of Germany'sJewish community.   ``No one among us will forget that there never would have been aseparation without the war started by Germany under Hitler,'' saidvon Weizsaecker, whose own father was convicted of two Nazi warcrimes for his role as a Foreign Ministry official.   Von Weizsacker said: ``For the first time, we Germans are notcreating a point of contention on the European agenda.''   Members of the renowned Berlin Philharmonic played works offamous German composers, including Johannes Brahms and JohannSebastian Bach.   The rebirth of Germany as the greatest economic power in Europehas worried its neighbors, particularly Poland, one-third of whoseterritory once belonged to Germany. Kohl singled out Poland whensaying that a future Germany will ``make no territorial claimsagainst anyone.''   Kohl, however, reiterated plans to amend Germany's constitutionto send German troops to the Persian Gulf. He said a united andsovereign Germany was willing to help U.N. efforts in ``protectingand restoring peace.''   Although Germany has committed $2 billion to the U.S.-ledmultinational effort to isolate Iraq after Iraqi troops invadedKuwait, Washington has urged the Germans to do more.   Germans say their constitution prevents them from sending troopsoutside NATO territory, but Kohl reaffirmed in his message that hewill seek an amendment that will make such a move possible.   His message came after Germany held a nightlong nationwidecelebration with fireworks and music.   The nation united at the stroke of midnight when a giant Germanflag was raised in front of the battle-scarred Reichstag buildingin Berlin. Kohl, von Weizsaecker and other leaders joined insinging the national anthem.   The unification came 11 months after the Berlin Wall fell in apeaceful revolt that cast aside Communist East German overlords.   Random violence marred the unification celebrations overnight innearly a dozen cities, including Hamburg, Goettingen and Leipzig,the cradle of East Germany's peaceful revolution against the oldCommunist government.   In Berlin, about 20,000 protesters, most of them young leftists,rallied Wednesday in the working class district of Kreuzberg. Asthe march moved toward central Alexanderplatz square, a group ofprotesters wearing masks broke store windows, set cars afire andscuffled with passers-by.   Police battled the protesters with nightsticks and fired watercannons and tear gas.</TEXT></DOC>
