Whitney andamp; Co., the venture capitalpartnership that acquired Prime in a 1989 leveraged buy-out.   The two partners most closely associated with Prime,Russell Planitzer who remains chairman of Prime, and Don E.Ackerman, both resigned as Whitney partners. Mr. Planitzersaid he resigned to &quot;give my full attention to Prime.&quot; JohnJ. Shields remains Prime's president and chief executiveofficer. Mr. Ackerman couldn't be reached for comment.</LP><TEXT>   The dissension at Whitney, a closely held New York firmthat owns most of Prime's stock through its DR Holdings Inc.unit is further evidence of the shaky condition of Prime andthe risks of LBO's in the cyclical, investment-intensivecomputer industry.   Whitney also wrote down its $105 million equity investmentin the Natick, Mass., computer firm, said Steven Galante,editor of Private Equity Analyst, a West Newton, Mass.,newsletter that first reported the changes. &quot;Prime has been adistraction for the Whitney organization,&quot; he said.   Whitney partners failed to return numerous phone calls.Prime said that Whitney's managing general partner, Benno C.Schmidt, and two other partners, Peter Casselman and JamesMacDonald, resigned from Prime's board. John Cunningham,former president of Wang Laboratories Inc. and Andrew Sage,former managing partner of Lehman Brothers, were added toPrime's board leaving one seat vacant.   Prime's largest creditor is Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,a unit of American Express Corp. that led the LBO and wasn'table to refinance a $500 million bridge loan when the junkbond market collapsed just after the deal was completed. AShearson spokesman said the firm hasn't written down the debtand considers it as good as money &quot;based on Prime'sprojections.&quot; Two Shearson employees remain Prime boardmembers. However, Shearson has written down the $66 millionvalue of its Prime stock to $10 million.   Prime's $1.24 billion in debt has bogged it down. In itsmost recent financial report, it reported a loss for thethird quarter ended Sept. 30 of $50.5 million on a 17% salesdecline to $315.8 million from $378.7 million.   Prime is restructuring by slashing its computermanufacturing business and focusing on selling software,especially the computerized design products made by itsComputervision subsidiary. Since the LBO, Prime's employmenthas been cut to 7,000 from 12,700. Much of its debt has beenrestructured to permit payment in kind rather than in cashuntil 1995.   Nevertheless, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. last month cutPrime's debt rating to triple-C-minus from triple-C.   For Whitney, one of the nation's oldest professionalventure capital firms, the Prime problems are embarrassing aswell as financially painful. It hadn't had much experience inleveraged buy-outs when Messrs. Planitzer and Ackermanconvinced other partners to serve as the white knightrescuing Prime from a hostile takeover offer by raiderBennett LeBow.   But buying Prime involved &quot;three initial problems -- therewas a high initial purchase price; interest rates were highand principal payments were high,&quot; said Mr. Cunningham, thenew board member. &quot;If you strip out the debt, it's a prettywell run business. The problem is they have tremendous debtservice.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
