The $47.9 million measure, which was passed on a 87-7 vote, will sustain the U.S.-backed forces in cease-fire zones within Nicaragua where they are to await the outcome of national reconciliation talks with the Sandinista government.    President Reagan is expected to sign the measure before leaving today for a 10-day California vacation.    During yesterday's debate, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) agreed that the Senate would quickly take up any future measure aiding the Contras that the House might approve later this year.    That assurance -- similar to a pledge House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) made in a letter to Mr. Reagan and House GOP Leader Bob Michel (R., Ill.) -- was sought by a group of Republican senators led by Ted Stevens of Alaska. The administration had wanted the legislation to guarantee a vote on future requests for aid, which could include military supplies, but settled for these assurances.    The bill, which was passed by the House Wednesday, gives the Contras $17.7 million in food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies over six months. The 60-day cease-fire truce reached last week specifically bars the rebels from receiving weapons and ammunition.    Another $17.7 million goes to care for children who have been wounded, orphaned or displaced by the seven-year civil war. In addition, the measure gives $2.5 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development to administer the assistance and $10 million to the Organization of American States to monitor the cease-fire.    Earlier aid to the Contras had ended on Feb. 29. </TEXT></DOC>
