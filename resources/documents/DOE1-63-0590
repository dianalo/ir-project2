German oil was nevercompetitive on the international market, using to the large number ofsmall, low-productivity fields; now that the oil price has dropped, costcoverage is no longer achieved. Production has declined, too, althoughnot as a result of the price drop but as a consequence of lower oil consumptionand higher natural gas import volumes. In 1986, also the petroleum andnatural gas production abroad of German companies decreases, as did theexploration and development activities within Germany. There were somecuts in staff, but the real danger is in the decline of exploration activitiesas this will lessen the chances of finding new deposits to replace thepresent ones once production declines.
