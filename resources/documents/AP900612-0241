At a news conference held with Egypt's Oil Minister Abdel-HadiKandeel, Otaiba said an emergecy OPEC conference would be held assoon as needed.   He stressed the importance for all OPEC countries to abide bythe cartel's decisions and cited as an example the UAE which hesaid reduced its daily petroleum production quota to 1.9 millionbarrels from 2.1 million barrels.   The UAE's 1.9 million quota is still far above its OPEC-decreedceiling of 1.095. In May however, the UAE was reportedly producing2.05 million barrels a day.   Despite an OPEC agreement in Geneva on May 2 to limit overallproduction to 22.1-22.6 million barrels a day, production lastmonth remained high at an estimated 23.68 million barrels a day,the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday. The newslettersingled out Kuwait and the UAE as producing well above their quotasset by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   MEES said the average spot price for seven OPEC crudes droppedto $15.45 a barrel in May from $15.63 a barrel in April,significantly lower than the cartel's benchmark price of $18 perbarrel.   Otaiba said preparation for a new OPEC ministerial conferencehas begun, and ``if neccessity calls for such an emergencyconference, it will be held.''   Otaiba said he expects the current oil market crisis to end intwo months following efforts and contacts among OPEC and non-OPECoil producing countries.   ``I have great hope that we can control the temporary crisis andovercome the terror gripping the market,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
