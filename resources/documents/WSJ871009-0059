The failed banks were First National Bank of Brush, Colo., which had assets of $22.3 million; United Services Bank, Hartshorne, Okla., which had assets of $15.2 million; and Citizens Bank of Krebs, Okla., which had assets of $14.2 million. The two Oklahoma banks were under the same ownership.    The Colorado bank's sole office, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen today as a branch of Fort Lupton State Bank, Fort Lupton, Colo., which is to change its name to First Security Bank effective today. First National, which held deposits of $21.3 million in 4,400 accounts, was the 10th Colorado bank to fail this year.    The sole office of United Services, closed by the Oklahoma bank commissioner, is to reopen today as a branch of First National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of McAlester, Okla. The failed bank held deposits of $13.5 million in 2,100 accounts, including 23 accounts that exceeded the $100,000 federal deposit insurance limit by $33,000.    Depositors of Citizens Bank, also closed by the state banking commissioner, will automatically become depositors of First National Bank andamp; Trust. The failed bank's sole office won't reopen. Citizens Bank held $13.2 million in 1,300 deposit accounts, including a total of $28,000 in 32 accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit.    Owners of uninsured deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed banks' assets. A total of 29 banks have failed in Oklahoma this year. </TEXT></DOC>
