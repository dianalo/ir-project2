The independents, recently heralded as the creative salvationfrom Hollywood's major studios, have been unspooling reels ofhere-today-gone-tomorrow clunkers: ``Messenger of Death,''``Freeway,'' ``Illegally Yours,'' ``Straight to Hell,'' and``Kansas'' among the most anemic failures.   Just as audiences are avoiding these titles, those responsibleare trying to dodge financial ruin. The De Laurentis EntertainmentGroup is in bankruptcy proceedings, as is FilmDallas Inc. The CannonGroup lost close to $100 million last year. Debt-heavy New WorldEntertainment dropped more than $28 million in the second quarter of1988.   While a few independents such as Orion Classics prosper with aslate of fanciful films such as the new ``Women on the Verge of aNervous Breakdown,'' many companies _ including once-celebratedIsland Pictures _ are laying off employees, cutting production orignoring bills in desperate attempts to balance books in a toughermovie market.   ``A lot of people have been burned,'' said Robert Shaye,president and chief executive officer of independent New Line CinemaCorp., which has the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise to keepits head above water.   Shipping to theaters typically low-budget movies they made orpurchased, the independents once had a future as bright as a klieglight. Though lacking the huge production and marketing divisions ofthe studios, these smaller outfits shamed Hollywood's power playerswith inventive and well-received projects.   They succeeded by giving film makers what they most covet _freedom. ``I think (the independents) offer more tender loving care.That's basically what it takes to release a movie well,'' directorTony Bill said recently.   And such concessions occassionally paid off. Cinecom's romantic``A Room With a View'' was a $16 million critical hit in 1986.Island's ``She's Gotta Have It,'' directed by Spike Lee, was asuccess that same year, and U.S. fans flocked to Skouras Pictures'1987 release of the Swedish film ``My Life As a Dog.''   Little did the independents know that real dog years were at hand.   The home video market, once able to make even the worst LindaBlair prison film profitable, changed into a business where only``quality'' movies would be rented.   Overextended by a release schedule of 385 films, up 100 percentfrom 1985, the independents were suddenly stuck with crates ofdead-on-arrival features.   ``There was a period of time when everybody thought that youcouldn't make an unprofitable movie,'' said Shaye. ``Even if youscrewed up, you could still make a profit in video.'' No longer. Andthings got worse.   As advertising costs soared, the major film companies _ Disney,Universal, United Artists, Warner Bros. and their pals _ introducedboth schlocky thrillers, such as ``They Live'' and ``Child's Play,''and the stylish personal films like ``Crossing Delancey'' and ``TheGood Mother'' once reserved for independents. Unlike typical studiomovies, aiming for the broadest possible audience, these filmsadapted the independents' fondness for the high-brow.   ``All of a sudden, the majors are catering to the adultaudience,'' said Ira Deutchman, president of marketing anddistribution for Cinecom. With nowhere else to turn, someindependents chose to match the studios withlowest-common-denominator washouts.   The results, in many cases, have been disastrous. ``All thosecompanies attempted to compete with the studios and they had theirhats handed to them on a platter,'' said Thomas Coleman, the formerchairman of Atlantic Entertainment Group.   Coleman should know. Soon after he made those remarks, thefinancially strapped Atlantic was bought by KVC Video for anundisclosed sum, and Coleman would no longer head the company.   Skouras, for one, failed in its recent releases, ``In a ShallowGrave'' and ``Waiting for the Moon.''   ``Those films were so ambitious in their scopes and budgets thatI think they probably should have been catered towards a majorstudio,'' said Jeff Lipsky, president of Skouras' motion picturedivision, which won't release another film until next March.   ``The most profitable independent films have been of theno-budget variety. Everybody's risks are low, and the media loves todiscover new talent. They love to be shocked,'' Lipsky said.   But the only surprise recently was how undistinguished theindependent films came to be. Cineplex Odeon's high hopes for ``TheGlass Menagerie'' were shattered by poor ticket sales. Cinecom'sfarm movie ``Miles From Home'' suffered from box-office drought.Vestron's ``Waxwork'' melted.   The major studios have bombs, too. But for the independents,teetering on a much narrower tightrope, consecutive flops can spellsudden trouble. Stung by the crash of ``Patty Hearst,'' Atlantic canscarcely afford another flop with ``1969.''   ``A lot of the smaller companies are really scrambling,'' saidWilliam Quigley, president of Vestron Pictures, buoyed by its``Dirty Dancing'' riches amid several less successful releases.   Alive Films _ makers of the rakish hit ``The Moderns'' _ isturning to horror movies for resuscitation. Vestron, Atlantic andthe Samuel Goldwyn Company are now pursuing midpriced dramas andcomedies with known actors aimed at a broad audience. ``You have tofind pockets of opportunity,'' said Atlantic's Coleman.   ``It doesn't make sense anymore to go out and buy a marginal artfilm from a country in Scandinavia,'' said Steve Rothenberg,Goldwyn's vice president of theatrical distribution.   ``Where we're heading is making commercial films like `MysticPizza' that cost between $3 (million) and $7 million,'' he said. Sofar, it's working: ``Mystic Pizza,'' a romantic comedy, is doingbrisk business.   Said Vestron's Quigley: ``For $7 million, we can do pictures thatlook like studio pictures, and, at least in the case of `DirtyDancing,' succeed about as well as any studio picture out there.''Vestron's ambitious lineup includes more than 20 films in comingmonths.   Skouras and Orion Classics, the latter riding on a wave ofaccomplished art-film hits, is following a different _ and perhapsless risky _ course. ``You have to look for ... subject matter thatthe majors wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole,'' said Skouras'Lipsky.   Orion Classics, with a knack for spotting small gems from adistance, has made a killing with ``Wings of Desire,'' purchased foraround $200,000 and already yielding $3 million in ticket sales. Thecompany will open the acclaimed Spanish movie ``Women on the Vergeof a Nervous Breakdown'' later this month.   But if independents continue to produce marginal films of anybudget or from any country, the shakeup is likely to continue.Nobody, it seems, is dying to spend six bucks on movies with nameslike Vestron's ``CHUD II.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, Jan. 11</NOTE></DOC>
