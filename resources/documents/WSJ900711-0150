The company said other actions being taken include&quot;significant cost and budget-cutting measures,&quot; but detailswon't be disclosed until later.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The company's financial performance in the past yearmakes it clear that a change in the way we do business isnecessary,&quot; Tom Gunn, president of the Mesa, Ariz.-basedsubsidiary, said in a statement. About a year ago, thehelicopter concern said it would streamline and restructure,and in February it initiated another cost-reduction plan thatincluded about 630 layoffs.   So far, though, little seems to have been turned around.In 1989, significant writedowns were recorded at thehelicopter unit, especially on the AH-64 Apache program.Moreover, the General Accounting Office in April branded thataircraft as breakdown-prone. &quot;The Apache's problems areserious and go beyond normal growing pains,&quot; a representativeof the congressional investigative arm testified at a Househearing. Then in May, Mr. Gunn's predecessor stepped downamid the company's continuing poor financial performance.   The helicopter unit, which employs about 7,000 people, hasfour product lines: the AH-64; the LH, on which it has teamedup with Textron Inc.'s Bell unit in a bid to develop a lightarmed reconnaissance helicopter for the Army; the MD-500,which features a no-tail rotor system; and the MDX, atwin-engine commercial helicopter that can seat up to eight.   &quot;The need to restructure is particularly acute in light ofthe dramatic changes in the world political picture and theresultant reduced spending for defense,&quot; Mr. Gunn said.   McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 1 military contractor,disclosed last month that it would try to pare $700 million ayear from its cost structure, corporationwide. The St. Louisaerospace firm, stung by losses principally at its transportaircraft division in California, has in the past year piledup debt and watched its stock price sink.   But a spokesman in Mesa said the helicopter unit's actionswere largely unrelated to its parent's recent plea for moreefficiency. &quot;I don't think I would connect the two,&quot; he said.   As part of the changes, McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co.said it would break into four autonomous divisions coveringits distinct product lines, supported by six other divisions.Previously, there were only seven divisions in all.   In addition, two unit vice presidents and two unitdirectors elected to take early retirement or to resign. NormHirsh, an executive vice president and a 27-year McDonnellDouglas veteran, also retired.</TEXT></DOC>
