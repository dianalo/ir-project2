<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-0947 </DOCNO><TEXT>The corrosion behaviour of the martensitic steel DIN 1.4914 in flowingliquid Pb-17Li has been tested in a test series of 3700 h duration. Thespecimens have been exposed to the melt of 550/sup 0/C flowing with avelocity of 0.3 m/s (R/sub e/proportional to 21x10/sup 3/). The lossof material can be expressed by the equation r(mm)=-0.0288+4.604x10/sup-5/t(h). The anual loss of material is R=0.37 (mm/yr). The liquid alloydoes not generate internal corrosion effects in this steel, the unequaldissolution layer is small compared to the thickness of the removed layer.The dissolution and precipitation of these amounts of material componentscauses problems in loop operation. The martensitic steel has, however,a better compatibility with the eutectic Pb-17Li than austenitic steels.</TEXT></DOC>
