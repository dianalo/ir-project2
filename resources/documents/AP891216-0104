De Klerk, an Afrikaner, told supporters in the Orange Free StateProvince that he wants to open negotiations with black leaders onthe country's future.   ``The time is now for us to all get together and get moreconsensus,'' said de Klerk, who has sought to ease racial tensionssince taking office in August.   Right-wing Afrikaners opposed to power sharing with blackscountered with several rallies demanding strict apartheid andcontinued white domination.   In Boksburg, an industrial town outside Johannesburg, and inMossel Bay, a southern coastal town, blacks canceled demonstrationsto avoid confrontations with rightist groups.   Afrikaners were celebrating the 1838 Great Trek, during whichtheir Dutch-descended ancestors left the British-ruled Cape Colonyfor the uncharted African wilderness.   Stories about hardships on the journey and battles with Africantribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the 3 millionAfrikaners, who make up about 60 percent of South Africa's whitepopulation and control the government.   The Afrikaners, preparing for a major battle with the Zulus onDec. 16, 1838, vowed to make it their holiest day if they won thefight. They did, and the anniversary is known as the Day of theCovenant.   Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi told 3,000 supporters at astadium in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg, that itwas time to ``consider signing a new covenant.''   ``Not between us and God, as our Afrikaner compatriots claimthey did in 1838, but a new covenant between us as white and blackSouth Africans,'' Buthelezi said.   He also appealed for unity among the nation's 28 million blacksand an end to three years of violence in Natal Province that pitshis relatively conservative Inkatha movement and the UnitedDemocratic Front, a national anti-apartheid coalition aligned withthe African National Congress guerrilla movement.   The front supports sanctions, protests, boycotts and otherconfrontational methods that Buthelezi opposes.   Despite his differences with the front and the outlawed ANC,Buthelezi said: ``I will not negotiate ... with the South Africangovernment until the day (ANC leader) Nelson Mandela is releasedfrom jail.''   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, is expected tobe freed within weeks. He met de Klerk on Wednesday to discussprospects for black-white political negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
