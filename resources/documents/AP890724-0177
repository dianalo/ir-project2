James C. Bennett, acting president of the American Rocket Co.,headquartered in Camarillo, Calif., said his firm will launch asingle stage rocket to an altitude of 100 miles carrying a model ofa space station crew return craft developed by the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology.   He said the model, about a one-third scale, will test a ``novelexperimental concept'' called a parashield.   The device, shaped rather like an umbrella, will be used toprotect the model during the high-speed portions of its return toEarth, and then will turn and act as an airbrake as the atmosphericthickens.   Bennett said the primary purpose of the mission was to test theparashield behavior during its fall toward Earth.   The experimental craft weighs about 600 pounds and will berecovered after falling into the sea about 135 miles off shore fromthe Vandenberg Air Force Base launch site.   Data will be collected by instruments on board and through theuse of long-range photography, he said.   A secondary payload on the flight will be a Department ofDefense experiment.   The Department of Transportation announced Monday that it wasgranting a commercial license to American Rocket for the launch.   Bennett said the launch will use an unusual hybrid rocket enginedeveloped by the company. The rocket is powered by a solid fuel,but uses liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. In this way, he said, therocket design has the safety advantages of a liquid-fueled rocket,with the dependability of a solid rocket.   Hydrid rockets, he said, can be turned on and off like a liquidrocket by controlling the flow of oxygen. But the hybrid is saferthan a solid fuel rocket because the propellant is not explosive.   The launch will be the first by the American Rocket Co. and thefirst commercial launch from Vandenberg, a center used by the AirForce to launch polar orbiting craft and to test intercontinentalballistics missiles.   Four earlier commercial launch licenses have been granted by theDOT and the department is reviewing eight other applications, theannouncement said.   Space Station Freedom, a permanent laboratory and crew quartersto be assembled in orbit in the mid-1990s, is to include a craftthat can be used by astronauts for an emergency return to Earth.The MIT model is to test a concept for that craft.</TEXT></DOC>
