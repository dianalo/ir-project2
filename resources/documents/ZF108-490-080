Malone, the center'sdirector.andP;  &quot;The innovations we are witnessing in information technology todayare dramatically altering the costs and possibilities of performing thisfunction.&quot;andM;The MIT center will work with people in a variety of disciplines, within andoutside MIT, as it seeks to integrate existing coordination theories fromsuch fields as economics, computer science and organizational theory.andP;  &quot;Allof these disciplines bear upon the question of coordination--that is, how theactivities of separate actors--both people and machines--can be combined inorder to achieve goals,&quot; says Malone.andM;Malone and his MIT colleagues seek to apply these coordination theories tosuch areas as developing decentralized organizational structures, exploringdistributed systems that can coordinate multiple processors and groupware.andM;Although the events at MIT may suggest that coordination theory is relativelynew, it has, in fact, been studied for decades.andP;  Anatol W. Holt, chieftechnical officer of Coordination Technology Inc. in Trumbull, Conn., forexample, has pioneered a concept know as &quot;coordination mechanics,&quot; a study ofcoordination that emphasizes task-oriented relationships among people workingtogether.andP;  A key part of Holt's theory is the use of Petri nets, amathematical approach to distributed processes.andM;Since 1986, advocates for computer-supported cooperative work have held threenational conferences.andP;  They have spurred the growth of such groupware systemsas coauthoring programs, PC LAN-based electronic mail and electronicconferencing systems.andM;Last year, the National Science Foundation awarded $4.1 million to MIT andfive other major U.S.andP;  universities to study coordination problems.andP;  AtCarnegie Mellon University, for instance, researchers are developing the Workin Preparation (PREP) Editor, a project that explores coauthoring andcommenting relationships across local and remote networks.andP;  At the Universityof California, Berkeley, a combination of economists and computer scientistsare studying the properties of various coordination algorithms for suchapplications as task scheduling.andP;  This spring, the NSF plans to award another$2 million for similar research.andM;The National Science Foundation is also in the initial stages of creating theNational Collaboratory, a high-speed network that will act as acomputer-based infrastructure for scientific collaboration.andP;  The network willenable scientists located across the globe to interact with one another, aswell as with scientific instruments and distributed databases.andP;  This networkcould yield benefits in many areas, for example, furthering globalenvironmental research through the sharing of timely information.andM;Two technology enablers of coordination applications are emerging in the1990s.andP;  PC networks, distributed across wide geographical areas, are creatinga new medium for coordination among people and processors.andP;  Additionally,open systems architectures that interoperate among dissimilar informationsystems will spur even more users to access and share information.andM;These technologies are allowing the application of coordination theory to abroad range of technical and social problems.andP;  For example, researchers arelooking at ways to better coordinate and understand information inheterogeneous databases.andP;  They are exploring design models that integratecollaboration technologies into people's work lives.andP;  They are studying theimpact of future information technologies on social systems andorganizations.andP;  And they are developing ways to better manage the vast influxof electronic mail.andM;Getting CooperationandM;Malone and colleagues at the MIT center have created an application forinformation management and cooperative work called Object Lens.andP;  The softwarecreates an environment in which users can take advantage of object-orientedconcepts to create their own coordination tools.andP;  For example, users ofObject Lens can combine applications such as intelligent mail sorting, aRolodex, a calendar, computer conferencing and project management tools.andM;&quot;Much of the coordination people are involved in originates from their needto know about or manipulate the same objects, such as shared resources,customers or design components,&quot; says Malone.andP;  &quot;So, what's needed areenvironments that allow users to easily represent and share information aboutcommon objects.&quot;andM;Object Lens evolved from Information Lens, an earlier system that providesintelligent tools to help manage large streams of electronic messages.andP;  Nowan application of Object Lens, Information Lens uses intelligent agents tohelp users find information that they wouldn't have seen and to file, sortand prioritize their messages.andP;  Using simple if/then rules, Information Lensusers receiving messages can automatically discard junk mail and placepriority items in folders.andP;  Senders of messages can also use templates thathelp receivers and their agents process the messages more intelligently.andM;The MIT Project Athena, a major institutewide initiative to explore the useof computers for education, has developed a UNIX system based on InformationLens.andP;  Several companies, says Malone, are building commercial products basedon Information Lens that will operate in PC and Macintosh environments.andO;Although the research prototype of Object Lens was written in Xerox Lisp forXerox workstations, the MIT center is now working on Macintosh and UNIXversions.andM;Commercializing CooperationandM;The work on Information Lens fits closely with research that DigitalEquipment has been conducting, which is one reason why Digital decided tosponsor the MIT center.andP;  &quot;Information Lens is kind of Version One of aninformation filtration system, a concept we've been working on for sometime,&quot; says Howard Webber, manager of strategic planning and research for theBusiness and Office Systems Engineering Department at Digital.andP;  &quot;We want tomake it easy for people to keep track of and share knowledge about all kindsof work elements--people, time, tasks, projects, messages and companies.andO;That's partly a matter of creating the objects, but the trick is to organizeand coordinate them.&quot;andM;The MIT center is also exploring coordination mechanisms that can help usersunderstand and manage other electronic data streams, such as heterogeneousdatabases.andP;  Stuart E. Madnick, MIT Sloan School professor of management andhead of the MIS department is looking at how the problem affectsmultinational corporations.andM;Underlying every information system and database, says Madnick, is avocabulary of meanings.andP;  In order for two systems to communicate, there mustbe an understanding of the semantics behind them.andP;  Coordinating queries andother interactions across multiple, physically distributed databases requiresmechanisms that systematically create a unified definition of an object ofdata.andM;Madnick and his colleagues have developed prototype software for acoordination mechanism that creates intelligent translators based on anunderstanding of the semantics of data from multiple data sources.andM;&quot;Most organizations today are focusing their efforts on building distributedSQL [Structured Query Language] systems that will improve connectivitybetween disparate and preexisting databases,&quot; says Madnick.andP;  &quot;But often, whatthey haven't realized is the second problem related to high-levelcross-functional integration: Once you get it [the information requested],what does it all mean?andP;  Generally, we have a very poor understanding of thevast majority of data today,&quot; he says.andM;New Workplace Design ModelsandM;On the other side of the country, researchers at a newly built terminal inthe San Jose International Airport are conducting a three-year study, calledthe Workplace Project, exploring how to design a workplace that reflects andfacilitates the way people actually work.andP;  The study is sponsored by XeroxCorp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).andM;Terry Winograd, a Stanford University computer science professor involved inthe project, has gained recognition as one of the early contributors tocoordination theory.andP;  His 1986 book Understanding Computers and Cognition,coauthored by Fernando Flores, challenges traditional notions of cognitivetheory and its use as a foundation for computer design and artificialintelligence.andP;  Winograd and Flores created one of the first--andcontroversial--commercial coordination products called the Coordinator.andM;In contrast to the idea that thought and learning is primarily anindividual-centered activity, Winograd and Flores put forward a coordinationtheory that uses a concept called &quot;speech acts.&quot;andP;  The idea is that language,and corresponding thought, is based on social interaction.andP;  Managers, forexample, must generate and maintain a network of conversations in whichrequests and commitments lead to successful completion of work.andM;Accordingly, the Coordinator monitors commitments made, keeping track of thestatus of tasks and alerting managers and subordinates when tasks areincomplete.andP;  Critics, however, charge that the software is too rigid andautocratic, running counter to the participatory framework Winograd andFlores present in the first half of their book.andP;  Winograd defends theCoordinator, arguing that it's best used in cases where people are workingtogether to get things done.andM;Winograd is further developing his speech act theory based on empiricalresearch at the San Jose International Airport.andP;  In his current research,Winograd says that it is important to understand the richness of humancommunications and ensure that it is not cut off in the design of computersystems.andP;  Yet his model has critics.andM;&quot;It's much too simple to say that the problem is a failure to make[communications of] commitments explicit--it's much more complicated thanthat,&quot; argues Lucy Suchman, an anthropologist and manager of the workpractice and technology area at Xerox PARC.andM;Suchman is also the leader of the The Workplace Project, which has become alaboratory in which varying theories of collaboration are being explored.andO;Researchers are looking at the operations groups of two major U.S.andP;  airlines.andO;Using a variety of media, such as teletype printers, phones, databasesystems, walkie-talkies, faxes, radios and the human voice, employees mustcoordinate a range of activities such as baggage handling, fueling theairplanes, transporting meals and updating flight displays.andM;The Unanswered QuestionandM;As collaboration experiments like the Workplace Project are realized, anunderlying question remains: What impact will coordination theories andcollaboration technologies have in the coming decade?andM;Suchman expresses concerns about the kind of theories and technologies beingdeveloped under the names of &quot;coordination&quot; and &quot;groupware.&quot;andP;  &quot;I have doubtsabout the extent to which we know what we're talking about--theoretically andempirically,&quot; she says.andM;Many commercially available groupware products, argues Suchman, reflect alack of understanding of the actual work settings for which the applicationsare designed.andP;  Additionally, she argues, designers are often naive or theysimply gloss over the political and social implications of new computerdesigns.andM;Some groupware products such as Lotus Notes, a group communications tool,have received rave reviews.andP;  And Esther Dyson, editor and publisher of the&quot;Release 1.0&quot; newsletter, maintains that industry will begin to see anincreasing number of viable commercial groupware products.andP;  &quot;The market isready for it,&quot; she says, adding, &quot;A major benefit of this technology is thatit will give people the time to do things that have more social value, likemaking decisions and understanding all the paper and data that is beingdistributed.&quot;andM;However, despite Dyson's optimism, some other groupware products remaincontroversial, as Suchman points out.andP;  In addition to the Coordinator, forexample, Enable Software in Ballston Lake, N.Y., markets group productivitysoftware called Higgins that includes the capability of electronicallymonitoring employees' work.andM;Although tools that help groups organize and monitor tasks can enhanceproductivity, monitoring functions can also be employed by management in away that raises serious issues of privacy and rights in the workplace.andP;  Saysone Enable technician, who asked not to be identified: &quot;We are finding thatamong customer sites with more than 1,000 Higgins users, management wantsmore centralized control in Higgins software for monitoring purposes.&quot;andM;That problem is related to a more fundamental issue that social scientistsstudying coordination theory are raising.andP;  &quot;By and large, informationdesigners have gotten to the point of realizing that computer systems live ina psychological world,&quot; says Michael Cohen, professor of political scienceand head of the Program of Information and Organization at the University ofMichigan's Institute of Public Policy.andP;  The Macintosh interface design, hesays, is a classic example in which designers have successfully taken thepsychological elements into account.andP;  &quot;But as we start putting largedistributed networks into groups, then designers have to start thinking aboutthe effects of computer design in a social world,&quot; Cohen explains.andP;  Thatorientation, says Cohen, raises new questions about the relationship betweencoordination systems and organizational issues, such as: Who has power?andP;  Whohas access to information? and How is managerial policy made?andM;Where Will It Lead?andM;Coordination theory may have its greatest impact in shaping organizations ofthe future.andP;  That is the opinion of Edgar H. Schein, the noted MITorganizational theorist.andP;  Such organizations, he says, may well be networksin which hierarchies will either disappear altogether or will be far lessimportant than other forms of coordination and interaction.andP;  &quot;Perhaps theorganization of the future will be more like a giant complex see-saw, inwhich everyone will have to contribute to effectively coordinate, andmanagement as such will either be invisible or nonexistent in the form inwhich we understand it today,&quot; he says.andM;The lower costs of coordination across organizations and new communicationinfrastructures are galvanizing new vertical market transactions such asbuying rather than manufacturing products or executing just-in-timemanufacturing operations.andP;  Researchers at the MIT center say this trend iscreating a new type of &quot;virtual&quot; company, made up of various firmscollaborating, each adding value to the partnership.andM;As an information society, we are entering a new stage.andP;  There is anincreasing trend toward decentralization of computation and human activity.andO;The question of how people and machines collaborate and coordinate workefficiently and productively is taking on a new level of importance forindustry, science and other segments of society.andM;As a theory, coordination is clearly in a nascent form.andP;  What is critical toits success is the nurturing of new scholarship and dialogue amongresearchers of various disciplines such as social scientists,anthropologists, economists, technologists, management and organizationaltheorists.andM;Part of that process will surely involve debate about the ultimate strengthsand limitations of coordination as a science.andP;  Concludes Webber at Digital:&quot;There are many technical and social issues to resolve.andP;  I don't think weknow yet what the parameters of coordination theory are.andP;  However, the ideaof coordination, as evident in the word itself, speaks not only to the easeof interactions among machine systems, but the ease of interaction amonghumans.&quot;andM;Daniel Williams is a freelance writer, consultant and special graduatestudent at MIT's Sloan School of Management.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
