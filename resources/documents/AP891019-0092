Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia said Commonwealth leaderswere ``disappointed'' that foreign banks agreed to reschedule $8billion of South Africa's $20 billion debt.   In South Africa, Finance Minister Barend du Plessis welcomed thedebt rescheduling as ``one of the most important internationalevents for South Africa this year.''   News of the bank deal came as leaders of the 49-nationCommonwealth met in closed session to debate sanctions againstSouth Africa, which quit the Commonwealth in 1961.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, the sole opponentof sanctions in the association of Britain and its former colonies,insists embargoes now would be irresponsible.   Mrs. Thatcher defended her stand today and accused theCommonwealth of promoting poverty through embargoes. ``Our courseis constructive. We want to help the people of South Africa,'' shesaid.   Australia is proposing a sanction plan for South Africa thatcalls on international banks to toughen lending conditions,including limiting maxium credit terms to 90 days.   It also calls for setting up a monitoring agency to scrutinizeSouth Africa's links with the international financial community.   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, at a news conference on thesecond day of the biennial summit, said bloodshed threatened toengulf southern Africa.   ``Bankers are sucking at that blood by supporting South Africa.They are bloodsuckers,'' he said.   Commonwealth leaders, apart from Mrs. Thatcher, had planned tolaunch a new drive to try to stymie South Africa's efforts toreschedule the $8 billion of its foreign debt that is due next June.   On Wednesday, Canadian officials said a three-nationCommonwealth team of representatives from Canada, Australia andIndia has been lobbying major international banks and received whathe called a ``favorable response.''   But within hours, the South African Reserve Bank announced ithas reached a deal with the creditors, mostly American and Europeanbanks.   On Wednesday Mrs. Thatcher, arguing that South African PresidentF.W. de Klerk deserves encouragement, urged the Commonwealth not torebuff ``the most helpful sign for many years that progress waspossible.''   She cited de Klerk's release this week of eight blacknationalist leaders, relaxation of restrictions on anti-governmentdemonstrations and his ``willingness to consult all shades ofopinion.''   Canada proposes maintaining existing sanctions but holding offon new ones for six months as a challenge to de Klerk to get thewhite-dominated Parliament to abolish race laws by then.   The laws include regulations that deny the black majority thevote and segregate residential areas and health services.   Commonwealth officials predicted that the six-month moratoriumproposal was likely to be supported, although reluctantly, by someAfrican and Asian countries.   Most Commonwealth leaders maintain that sanctions, althoughunevenly applied, have forced South Africa to move toward change.   Britain, a major South African trading partner, has long arguedthat sanctions hurt blacks most and increase white resistance tochange.   A list of Commonwealth sanctions drawn up in 1986 included banson air links, imports of farm produce and a range of other goods.   As a compromise, Britain agreed to a handful of the embargoes.Black southern African countries, which depend economically onSouth Africa, have also taken only limited measures.</TEXT></DOC>
