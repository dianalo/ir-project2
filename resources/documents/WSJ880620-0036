Gleason, chairman and president.    Costs of developing and introducing a new automobile differential will consume a major part of the operating profit produced by Gleason's machine-tool and industrial-product businesses, Mr. Gleason said. The company had expected the differential to cross over into the black sometime this year, but that no longer appears likely, he said.    Mr. Gleason declined to predict whether the company will earn a profit for the second quarter or full year.    For 1987, Gleason reported a net loss of $1.3 million on sales of $229.5 million. Last year's loss included restructuring charges of $5 million, partly offset by an extraordinary credit of $3 million from cumulative effect of a change in inventory accounting. In last year's second quarter, the company had a loss of $220,000 on sales of $59.3 million.    Reflecting improved demand for the company's gear-cutting machine tools and other products, order backlogs at the end of the first quarter totaled $108.7 million, up 13% from a year earlier, Mr. Gleason said in an interview. The backlog of unfilled orders currently is the highest in three years, the company said.    However, there is a lag of nine months to a year between receipt of an order and shipment of the company's complex gear-cutting machines. Results for 1988 will depend heavily on whether shipments of recently ordered machines can be accomplished in the fourth quarter, or carry over into 1989, Mr. Gleason said.    Gleason doesn't expect to have significant restructuring costs this year, Mr. Gleason said. The company's big question mark is whether the new differential will be widely adopted by the auto industry, and when it will come into fairly common use. So far it is used by a handful of European car makers, and for a U.S. military vehicle.    A differential is a system of gears that allows one wheel to turn faster than the other when a vehicle goes around corners. Gleason's product improves traction and handling because it automatically shifts more power to the wheel that has the best traction. However, it costs more than twice as much as the standard unit. </TEXT></DOC>
