Prof. Aziz Ab'Saber, one of the project's architects, saidthe plan is intended to provide raw material for Brazil'spaper-and-pulp industry, fight global warming and improve thelocal environment.   Brazil is seeking international funding. But with thecountry already heavily indebted to foreign lenders, it maybe difficult to raise more funds.                                                                                                          TURNING SCRAP TO GOLD                                                                                                          Scientists emigrating from the Soviet Union to Israel areliving an alchemist's dream: turning scrap metal into gold,silver and platinum. Officials of Satec, a firm set up in1987, say a ton of worn-out printed circuit boards can beturned into 10 to 28 ounces of pure gold in hours, at abouthalf the price of other processes. Soviet immigrant HermanBranover set up Satec after a Brooklyn rabbi urged more jobsfor Soviet scientists in Israel. Satec will funnel expectedprofit to jobs and homes for other immigrants.

The accord, reachedduring the first ministerial-level meeting between Japan andthe EC Commission in 3 1/2 years, is mainly aimed at findingways to reduce the EC's persistent $20 billion trade deficitwith Japan. The two sides also agreed to expand a program topromote EC exports to Japan.
