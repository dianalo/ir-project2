There are six stamps in the set, each featuring a different RAFplane associated with Guernsey during the past half-century. Thestamps are issued in three pairs, each pair in a differentdenomination.

There is an 18-pence that features a Sunderland aircraft flyingon the ocean's surface, and another 18-pence that bears aDeHaviland 89 Rapide on the airport Tarmac.
