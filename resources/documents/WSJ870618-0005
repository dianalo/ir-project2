SchellhardtStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> XMINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN><DATELINE> PITTSBURGH  </DATELINE><TEXT>   USX Corp. said it is raising steel-plate prices $20 a ton, or about 5%, effective with Oct. 4 deliveries -- the fourth such price boost in 13 months for the nation's largest steelmaker.    USX didn't give a reason for the increase, but industry officials and analysts said it chiefly reflects the current tight supply of steel plate, used in the heavy capital goods, shipbuilding, defense and bridge-construction sectors.    Shipments of steel plate account for only about 5% of all domestic steel shipped.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, USX shares closed at $32.50, up $1.    Supplies of steel plate have been tightening because a number of steelmakers have either stopped making it or haven't reopened some plate-making plants.    USX' steelmaking division, for example, currently is making steel plate only at its Gary, Ind., works and hasn't started up production at facilities in Texas and Utah since a lengthy strike ended earlier this year. Phoenix Steel Co. has stopped plate production entirely.    Shipments of steel plate have been running about 14% below those of a year ago.    &quot;This increase isn't driven by demand,&quot; said Charles Bradford, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analyst. &quot;Our outlook for demand isn't very strong.&quot;    Mr. Bradford said supplies continue to be constrained by lingering effects of the now-ended USX strike; USX hasn't gotten steel production back to levels some industry analysts had expected by this time.    Other steel-plate makers, including Lukens Inc., Coatesville, Pa., and Bethlehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, Pa., are studying USX's price increase, spokesmen said yesterday.    USX raised steel-plate prices last Aug. 31, on April 5, and on shipments to be delivered later this month. </TEXT></DOC>
