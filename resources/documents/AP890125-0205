BakerIII as secretary of state Wednesday as Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell pledged to cooperate with the Bush administration whilepursuing a Democratic agenda of improvements in the minimum wage,housing, health care and the environment.   The Democratic-controlled Senate also confirmed Elizabeth Dole asLabor Secretary and Richard Darman as Budget Director without adissenting vote.   Mitchell, in a speech that seemed crafted as a response toPresident Bush's inaugural address, said he looked forward to ``truebipartisanship'' on foreign policy. He said that meant the WhiteHouse must commit itself to ``full, timely and meaningfulconsultation'' with Congress.   The first votes were anything but contentious.   The roll call was 99-0 to confirm Baker, who served as TreasurySecretary and White House chief of staff under President Reagan andwas President Bush's campaign manager last year. He was sworn intooffice minutes later, the State Department said.   Mrs. Dole, the wife of Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole, also wonapproval on a 99-0 vote. She is a former Secretary of Transportationwho resigned her post to help her husband's unsuccessful 1988presidential campaign.   Darman's confirmation roll call was 99-0, as well. He is a formertop aide to Baker at the Treasury and will be Bush's point man inthe drive to reduce the federal deficit.   In all three instances, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla, was the onlysenator who didn't vote.   In the busiest day so far of the new, 101st Congress, committeesalso held confirmation hearings for several Cabinet appointees.Among them was Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, who said``there is a need for reform'' at the Pentagon and pledged to workwith Congress to achieve it.   Nearly a quarter of the Senate sponsored legislation to block the$45,000 proposed congressional pay raise scheduled to take effect onFeb. 8. The proposal would roll back the increase if, as expected,the House lets it become law without a vote.   The Bush administration worked behind the scenes to defusecontroversy over one Cabinet appointment.   Louis Sullivan, named to head the Department of Health and HumanServices, met privately with anti-abortion senators and apparentlypersuaded them he is committed enough to their cause to win theirsupport for confirmation.   ``Dr. Sullivan believes in his heart that the Roe vs. Wadedecision should be overturned,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,referring to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.Sullivan had upset many conservative senators when he was quoted byanother senator as saying he did not favor overturning the ruling.   Baker, Dole and Darman were the first Bush appointees to faceconfirmation votes in the Senate. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Education Secretary LaurioCavazos are holdover appointments from the Reagan administration anddid not require confirmation.   The House was not in session, but inside the Senate chamber,speeches by Mitchell and Republican leader Bob Dole were followed bythe introduction of legislation for the first time this year.   The bills ranged from a measure to block the proposed $45,000 payraise for lawmakers _ or repeal it if it takes effect on Feb. 7 _ toDole's proposal for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitition.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., filed legislation to raise theminimum wage gradually from $3.35 to $4.55 an hour and Sen. StromThurmond, R-S.C., filed ethics legislation that was approved lastyear but vetoed by President Reagan.   Dole, who spoke a few moments after Mitchell, pledgedbipartisanship and added it was the intention of the Republicans to``support and further the cause of our new Republican president.''   Mitchell, in a speech that seemed drafted to reply to Bush'sinaugural address of last week, said the president had ``put hishand out to me and the speaker of the house. I now extend mine tohim.''   Mitchell said, ``We enter a new era. The New Deal and the Reaganreaction to it are over. We face new circumstances.''   He said his objectives were to reestablish a bipartisan foreignpolicy while also establishing a new social contract at home ``thatdefines not only what our country will do for our citizens but whatour citizens will do for our country.''   The Maine Democrat cautioned Bush that bipartisanship on foreignpolicy required ``full, timely, and meaningful consultation withCongress'' on the part of the new administration.   Mitchell added that serious consultation ``will not preventdifferences between the Congress and the president. There havealways been such differences,. There always will be.''   His speech carried slightly more of a challenge to Bush ondomestic issues.   ``We look forward to receiving the president's budgetproposals,'' he said, adding that Democrats would work with Bush``to achieve a bipartisan budget reduction'' that is ``fair,credible and based on realistic economic projections.''   Mitchell said his speech was not designed as a detailed agendafor the year, but he did go into some detail. He said Democratswould seek legislation to deal with the homeless, health care andincreased research and development. He called for full funding for adrug bill approved a year ago, improvements in the Clean Air Act andsaid, ``We will raise the minimum wage to a rate that will helpthose who depend on it.''   He also said he favors legislation to establish a program ofvoluntary national service.   Mitchell pledged to seek enactment of a comprehensive package ofethics legislation, including laws restricting lobbying activitiesof former members of Congress, a campaign finance bill and a ban onspeaking and appearance fees received by senators andrepresentatives.   He did not say so in his speech, but he told reporters beforehandhe favors a pay raise for members of Congress as part of the ethicspackage.   The proposed $45,000 pay raise has become the most controversialissue of the new Congress, and opponents introduced legislationduring the day to block it, or, in the event it takes effect, torepeal it. Their measure is designed to thwart apparent plans byHouse Speaker Jim Wright to prevent a vote on the pay raise until ittakes effect automatically in two weeks.   Lawmakers' salaries are to rise from just over $89,000 to$135,000, an increase of 50 percent. Federal judges and somepolitical appointees would also receive increases.</TEXT></DOC>
