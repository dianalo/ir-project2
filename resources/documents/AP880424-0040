The statement came hours after an Iranian gunboat attacked aSaudi Arabian tanker in the gulf, despite a warning by PresidentReagan that Iran faced ``very costly'' consequences if it continuedhitting neutral ships and other targets.   The extremists made their latest threat in a handwrittenstatement signed by the Revolutionary Justice Organization, aShiite Moslem group, and delivered to The Associated Press and theFrench news agency Agence France-Presse.   The group holds Joseph Cicippio, 57, of Valley Forge, Pa., andEdward Tracy, 57, of Burlington, Vt.   ``Any new (U.S.) aggression under any pretext or excuse willlead to the execution of spy Edward Tracy first and Cicippiosecondly,'' the statement announced.   Tracy, a writer of children's books, was kidnapped Oct. 21,1986. Cicippio, acting comptroller at the American University ofBeirut, was kidnapped from campus earlier that year on Sept. 12.   Cicippio and Tracy are among nine Americans and 13 otherforeigners held hostage by various groups in Lebanon. The longestheld is 40-year-old Terry A. Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio, the chiefMiddle East correspondent for the Associated Press who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Both copies of Sunday's statement were accompanied byphotocopies of a Lebanese group's membership card bearing Tracy'sphotograph. However, the organization is not named on the card, andit was not clear if it was authentic.   Last Monday, U.S. warships disabled two Iranian frigates andsank or disabled four other armed Iranian vessels in the gulf.Tehran said 44 Iranians were killed.   ``The attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished andwill not be as easy as America assumes,'' the statement said. ``Ourlogical answer to the invasion of the region ... brings us to theoption of moving the battle arena to inside America, after whichthings will get out of control.''   In another development, Beirut's conservative Ad-Diyar dailynewspaper reported Sunday that a deal to free three French hostagesheld by another Shiite faction fell apart because of developmentsin the hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner. The report said the captorsreneged on pledges to release the French hostages because thehijackers were still in Algiers, Algeria.   Arab officials said that when the Algerians negotiated an end tothe 16-day hijacking Wednesday, the Shiite sky pirates abandonedthe plane for guaranteed safe conduct to another country. ButAd-Diyar, without citing sources, challenged earlier reports thatthe hijackers had left Algiers and gone to either Iran or Lebanon.   Sunday's threat was the second issued by Revolutionary Justicein less than a week. The group said in a similar handwrittenArabic-language statement Tuesday that there would be``retaliations and retaliations'' for U.S. military action in thegulf.   The earlier statement was accompanied by a Polaroid photographof Cicippio.   In Sunday's statement, the extremists described U.S. navalpresence in the gulf as a ``mean challenge to the free nations ofthe world.''   The fighting in the gulf last Monday flared after U.S. warshipsblasted two offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washingtontermed a ``measured response'' to the mining of a U.S. frigateApril 14.</TEXT></DOC>
