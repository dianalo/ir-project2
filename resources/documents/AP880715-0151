The Soviet Union said the U.S. Navy should leave the PersianGulf to avoid future tragedies like the shooting down of Iran AirFlight 655. It said an international U.N. fleet should replace theAmerican warships.   As the Security Council resumed debate on the July 3 incident,the Soviets, Britain, France, China, Japan, and West Germany allcalled on Iran to accept a year-old council resolution calling fora cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.   Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati said at a newsconference that ``the attitude of the U.S. administration issimilar to a rich man's son who drives when he's drunk. He thinksmoney can buy everything, and that is not true.''   The United States offered to pay compensation to the families ofthe victims but said it did so out of humanitarian concerns and notbecause it is legally obligated.   Velayai said the U.S. offer would be acceptable only ``withinthe context of the United States accepting responsibility forshooting down the Iranian airliner.''   U.S. officials say Navy forces shot down the airliner becausethey thought it was an Iranian F-14 jet fighter.   During debate, the Soviet representative, Valentin V. Lozinskiy,said ``the tragedy has demonstrated once again that the UnitedStates fleet must leave the waters of the Persian Gulf right away.''   ``How can one regard as self-defense the destruction of apassenger airliner flying within an established air corridor manythousands of kilometers from the borders of the power that isallegedly defending itself?'' he asked.   British U.N. official John Birch expressed his country's``profound regret'' over the loss of life but said the underlyingcause of the disaster, and of all war-related casualties in thePersian Gulf, is Iran's refusal to accept the cease-fire resolution.   Iran never decisively rejected the resolution but has insistedthat Iraq be branded the aggressor in the war as the first steptoward peace.   France's representative, Pierre Brochand, said ``theinternational community cannot pass judgment on such a tragic errorwithout the results'' of an inquiry by the International CivilAviation Organization in Montreal. The ICAO's governing councilagreed Thursday that such an inquiry should be conducted.   ``We should of course take into account the conditionsprevailing in the region ... a region for years fraught withinsecurity because of the Iran-Iraq war,'' Brochand said, incalling on Iran to honor the cease-fire resolution.   The debate adjourned until Monday.   Iran requested the council meeting to seek condemnation of theUSS Vincennes' downing of the Airbus A300 over the Strait of Hormuzand to demand withdrawal of all American forces from the gulf. Ithas not been able to muster the votes for a condemnation.   On Thursday, Vice President George Bush called the incident a``terrible human tragedy'' but said Iran shares responsibility. Hesaid the United States has a legal right to protect Middle Eastshipping lanes.   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Iran and the 15 members ofthe Security Council agreed that council President PauloNogueira-Batista of Brazil would draft a document in consultationwith Iran and the members, which include the United States.   Giuliani said it was not known whether the document would be aresolution, which requires a vote, or a statement from the councilpresident adopted by consensus, which carries far less weight.   The move was considered a confirmation that Iran had failed topersuade a majority of the Security Council members to pass aresolution denouncing the United States.   The Vincennes and the USS Elmer Montgomery had skirmished withIranian attack boats just before the jetliner entered the area.   The United States says the airliner did not respond to repeatedquestioning by the Vincennes about its identity, and the cruiser'scaptain believed it was an F-14 transmitting ambiguous signals anddescending in attack pattern.   ``After seven unanswered warnings,'' Bush said, the captain``did what he had to do to protect his ship and the lives of hiscrew.''   Velayati read what he said was a transcript of a communicationbetween Iran Air Flight 655, flying from a military-civilianairport at Bandar Abbas, Iran, across the Strait of Hormuz to Dubaiin the United Arab Emirates, and the Bandar Abbas control towerjust before the attack.   The transcript contained no warnings from the Vincennes orcommunications with it.   ``The shooting down of an Iranian civil airliner, flying on ascheduled flight known to the U.S. warships, and using aninternationally established and published civilian airway andtransmitting signals identifying itself as a civilian airlinercould not have been a mistake,'' he said.   Bush said, ``I will not dignify with a response the charge thatwe deliberately destroyed Iran Air 655.''</TEXT></DOC>
