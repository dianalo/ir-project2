The official, who declined to be identified, said the branches could be opened this year. An official of the Japanese Finance Ministry's banking bureau declined to comment.    Most Japanese banks currently have only branch-office status in Germany, although Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., a big long-term credit bank, and Bank of Tokyo Ltd., a commercial bank, have universal units there.    The report &quot;proves that reciprocity is alive and well,&quot; said a senior U.S. bank official in Tokyo. Late last year, Britain approved licenses for two Japanese securities companies to operate banking units in the United Kingdom after four British brokerages gained membership on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Two German institutions also won membership. </TEXT></DOC>
