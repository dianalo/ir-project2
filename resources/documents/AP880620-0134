Henri Namphy todaydeclared himself president of Haiti after troops stormed thenational palace and deposed civilian President Leslie Manigat.   ``The future of democracy and liberty was at stake. The armymust protect the superior interests of the country and must headthe country,'' Namphy said in a television broadcast late thismorning from the presidential palace.   ``To this end, a military government has been formed with, aspresident, Gen. Henri Namphy,'' he said.   The coup ended four months of civilian government and put Namphyback in command of the nation he led for two years as head of athree-man junta. It came less than a week after Manigat firedNamphy and tried to reorganize the military.   Namphy was surrounded by military leaders, including Lt. Col.Jean-Claude Paul, once Manigat's chief military ally. It was notimmediately known if Paul had aligned himself with Namphy.   Manigat and his family arrived today in Santo Domingo, thecapital of neighboring Dominican Republic. Manigat was staying atthe Dominican Concorde Hotel, a hotel spokesman said. Haiti and theDominican Republic share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.   ``The president betrayed your confidence and violated theconstitution he swore to observe,'' Namphy said. ``He took a paththat led irrevocably to the most brutal form of dictatorship. Tothis end, he attacked the army and shook its high command to makeit a docile instrument of personal power. He thus imperiled theconquest of Feb. 7.''   A few hours later, the military announced a new Cabinet ofministers. The announcement said the Senate and House of Deputieshad been dissolved and that the new government would rule by decree.   The new Cabinet, announced on state-run television by Col. GaryLeon, general secretary of the armed forces, was made up of 11members of the military and one civilian.   Manigat was inaugurated as president Feb. 7. The junta steppeddown after he took office.   Manigat retired Namphy as commander in chief of Haiti's7,000-man army on Friday, charging him with insubordination inordering the transfer of Paul and other high-ranking officers threedays earlier.   Namphy first appeared on state-run television at about 1:30 a.m.in a broadcast from the palace shortly after the coup.   ``The army will lead the country this way,'' he declared, wavingan Uzi submachine gun and flanked by soldiers.   There was no official word on casualties from the takeover.   A man at Manigat's residence was on the telephone with the MiamiNews when soldiers moved in. Jean Lescouflair identified himself asdirector of the regional Information Ministry and a former Miamiteacher. He said Manigat was upstairs with government ministersdiscussing how to respond to Namphy's statement when soldiersarrived at about 3:08 a.m.   ``I am hearing some noise coming like a machine gun,'' he said,lowering his voice. ``They are entering the yard now ... It seemslike they are smashing the cars in the yard.''   At 3:20 a.m. Lescouflair told the Miami News he could hear asecurity guard shouting in French, ``Don't shoot! We're comingout!''.   A few minutes later, someone was heard yelling ``Hands up!'' inFrench, the newspaper said. The last words from Lescouflair were,``Call my wife. Goodbye.''   Haitian journalists said troops loyal to Manigat were killedwhen soldiers backed by three tanks freed Namphy from house arrestand stormed the palace. Namphy had been held at his residence inBon Repos, 15 miles outside the capital.   The front of the palace did not appear damaged and showed nosign of battle.   The airport was closed today. By midday, the streets of thecapital were busy with cars, trucks and pedestrians.   Early today, radio stations were not broadcasting news, onlymusic, and international operators refused to accept calls. Oneoperator said Namphy ordered operators not to place calls, but itwas possible to dial directly.   People on the streets were aware of what had happened, despitethe lack of radio reports.   ``It's not good for democracy, what happened, but it may be goodfor Haiti,'' said one 22-year-old unemployed laborer. ``Maybe wecannot talk, but maybe we can work.''   The fighting began after a 10-minute blackout at about 7:30 p.m.Sunday. The streets of this Caribbean capital became deserted.Automatic and heavy caliber gunfire broke out around the palace.   Heard from a hotel two blocks away, it died down, then surgedfor 1{ hours again just after midnight, when explosions also wereheard.   Government sources said Manigat, 57, was taken by ambulance fromhis home to a military hospital. A Haitian journalist said Manigatwould be expelled from the country.   An Agence France-Press reporter spoke by telephone with Manigatearly today and reported the president said he was uninjured.   Earlier Sunday, Manigat retired the Port-au-Prince police chefand transferred about two dozen officers, including the head of thepresidential guard.   ``The presidential guard went to get Namphy and brought him tothe palace,'' said the Western diplomat, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The army has controlled this impoverished nation during most ofits 184-year history. A junta ruled Haiti for two years afterdictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in February1986.   The military ran the Jan. 17 balloting in which Manigat waselected. The most popular candidates and most voters boycotted theelection, and it was widely criticized as rigged.   An independently run election Nov. 29 was thwarted by violencethat left more than 30 people dead.   Paul's soldiers were blamed for much of the violence, afterwhich the United States withheld $60 million in aid. Paul wasindicted in March by a U.S. grand jury on drug trafficking charges.</TEXT></DOC>
