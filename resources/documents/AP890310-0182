The study also recommended more asylum petitions be granted andprocedures be developed to help those truly deserving refugee statusmake their case, as some worthy applicants, it said, are goingunderground because of the risks of detention and deportation.   Senate staff members who visited the Rio Grande Valley inFebruary, after the Immigration and Naturalization Service begandetaining refugee-seekers while their asylum cases were pending,said most applications appear frivolous.   The study mission said the INS procedures in general areadequate. But it was not convinced the small percentage ofborderline cases, known as ``intent to deny'' applicants becausethey must provide additional information or risk denial, was givenadequate opportunity to present a claim.   ``One important question, not answered to the delegation'ssatisfaction, is whether these `intent to deny' applicants areinformed of the specific areas of weakness or incompleteness intheir cases,'' the study said.   The study suggested strenthening procedures for the borderlinecases, such as outlining the reasons denial was being considered forapplicants so they could then ``more meaningfully rebut their casein the two-week period currently allowed.''   Some of the ``intent to deny'' cases reviewed by the studymission should have been approved, the report said in urging thatasylum officers be given ``wider latitude to approve cases _ to erralways in favor of the applicant.''   It also found ``a handful of Central Americans with promisingasylum claims _ but who had no intention of risking detention anddeportation by applying for asylum.''</TEXT></DOC>
