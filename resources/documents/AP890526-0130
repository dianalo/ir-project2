McCLAIN</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consumer spending in April posted its bestperformance in nearly a year, rising 1.1 percent, the governmentsaid Friday in a report that analysts said shows the economyremains healthy even as growth slows.   Meantime, the government reported a sharp improvement in theU.S. trade deficit in the opening quarter of the year as exportsjumped 5.7 percent.   While consumer spending rose at its fastest pace since a 1.3percent increase last June, much of the growth was attributed to asharp increase in auto sales because of rebates, low-interest loansand other industry incentives to move cars off dealers' lots.   The Commerce Department also reported that personal income rosea weak 0.4 percent last month compared with hikes of 0.8 percent inMarch and 1 percent in February. The April figure was the smallestincrease since last November's 0.2 percent.   But analysts blamed the sluggish income growth in April on lowerfarm subsidies over the past two months and a fallback from higherauto industry bonuses and retroactive Social Security payments inMarch.   Discounting the auto sales and one-time weakness in incomes,``what you come out with is reasonably decent income andconsumption growth which tends to make the Fed's soft-landingscenario look more realistic,'' said analyst Cynthia Latta of DataResources in Lexington, Mass.   Federal Reserve credit-tightening designed to stem inflation hascaused some economists to worry that resulting higher interestrates could move the economy into a recession, rather than thetargeted soft landing.   But recent reports continue to point to an economic slowdownwithout recession.   And Friday's income and spending report tells the Fed ``that sofar, so good; that there's no reason to change what they're doingbecause it doesn't yet look like they're guilty of overkill,'' Ms.Latta said.   Sandra Shaber of The Futures Group in Washington agreed, saying,``This certainly doesn't suggest that the economy is collapsing byany means.''   But Ms. Shaber said consumer spending, which recorded increasesof only 0.3 percent in March and 0.4 percent in Feburary, ``hasbeen kind of sluggish'' because of ``higher interest rates and anerosion of consumer confidence.''   On trade, the Commerce Department said the 5.7 percent jump inexports boosted U.S. overseas sales to a record $88.5 billionduring January, February and March.   The department said the quarterly deficit was $27.6 billion, thesmallest such imbalance in four years, compared with $32.02 billionin the last quarter of 1988. That was a drop of 13.7 percent.   The department's merchandise trade report, calculated on abalance of payments basis, also registered a record $116.13 billionin imports, but the 0.3 percent increase was smaller than the paceof export expansion.   In the other report, Commerce said personal income increased by$17.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.37trillion in April, while consumer spending rose $35.9 billion to anadjusted annual $3.42 trillion rate. Consumer spending representsabout two-thirds of overall economic activity.   The consumer spending figure includes a 3.2 percent increase indurable goods _ big ticket items such as cars expected to lastthree years or more _ to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of$467.1 billion. Durable spending fell the previous two months whenauto sales were weak.   Non-durable goods purchases rose 0.7 percent and spending onservices was up 0.8 percent in April.   The change in disposable income _ income after taxes _registered a flat zero last month, down from March's 0.8 percentincrease. Higher-than-usual federal income tax payments in Aprilbecause of 1986 changes in tax law resulted in much of the decline.   The personal savings rate suffered from the increase in taxpayments, falling to 5.3 percent from a three-year high of 6.3percent in March.   Wages and salaries rose 0.6 percent to $2.61 trillion at aseasonally adjusted annual rate.</TEXT></DOC>
