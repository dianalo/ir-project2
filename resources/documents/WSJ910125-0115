And in Aspen, Colo., a dry cleaneroffers to spiff up American flags for free.</LP><TEXT>   Although the conflict's impact on the price of oilultimately may have the most far-reaching consequences, bothfor the economy and for individual companies, businesses arebeing forced to react in a multitude of ways -- some major,others more subtle.   In the days since the first shot was fired, they havecoped with effects ranging from shifting consumer sentimentto the threat of terrorism. Many have scrambled to adjustmarketing and advertising plans, while others have increasedoutput of such items as Middle East maps, medical suppliesand munitions.   In the first few days, retailers found stores empty aspeople stayed home to watch war news on TV. Many movietheaters and theme parks also were vacant, and professionalsporting organizations considered canceling some events. TheNational Football League says it won't make a final decisionon whether to play the Super Bowl until game time on Sunday.   The mood of the consumer remains a critical concern formany. In a survey conducted Wednesday evening, Chicago-basedLeo J. Shapiro andamp; Associates found increased pessimism: 84% ofrespondents said they were less willing to travel by air, 49%said the war made this a worse time to invest in stocks, 47%thought it a poorer time to buy a house, and 45% said it wasa worse time to get a new car.   Some businesses, however, already are finding ways to turnwar into opportunity. Those providing security guards reporta surge in business. Sales of TV sets and radios have risen,and so have orders for cable-TV hookups. Revell/MonogramInc., the nation's largest maker of plastic model kits, saysorders for model planes like the F-117A Stealth are runningas much as 300% ahead of last year.   In San Francisco, Bechtel Group Inc., the big engineeringand construction concern, has been meeting with exiledKuwaiti leaders &quot;to help them plan the restoration of oilproduction&quot; once the war ends, says a spokesman.   Oil companies, airlines and defense contractors are amongthe industries most likely to be significantly affected bywar, but they're by no means the only ones. Defense shipmentsbound to the Mideast have been a &quot;big boost to us,&quot; says JohnKelly, an executive at CSX Corp.'s railroad unit, which hasmoved more than 8,000 cars of military gear to East Coastports since the U.S. began its buildup in August.   Despite soaring war-risk insurance rates, some shippingcompanies are still trading in the region and passing thehigher costs to charterers and shippers. &quot;We went into theGulf all during the Iran-Iraq war, and things were much worsethen,&quot; says Robert Matthes, vice president of corporateinformation of Stolt-Nielsen Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., tankeroperator. Curiously, some air-cargo firms say fear ofterrorism is making it easier for them to move supplies forthe military on U.S. domestic flights because more passengersare afraid to fly.   One product Americans often associate with war, Spam, hasstayed stateside this time. Spam maker Geo. A. Hormel andamp; Co.says the Saudis asked the Army not to bring in supplies ofpork, which Spam contains. War &quot;has not been a plus,&quot; says aHormel spokesman.   What follows is an industry-by-industry look at effectsthat the Gulf War has already been having on U.S. business:                                                                                                          Advertising                                                                                                          The Gulf war has prompted scores of advertisers to haltcommercials during special TV news coverage that pre-emptsregular programming. They include Procter andamp; Gamble Co.,McDonald's Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. and Ford Motor Co. Airlines and oil producershave gone further, canceling or postponing most advertising.If the pullback lasts very long, it is likely to affectagency staffing levels, says William Tragos, chairman andchief executive of TBWA Advertising.   TBWA canceled a board of directors meeting next week inLondon, and international meetings this week were postponedat J. Walter Thompson, owned by WPP Group PLC, and BackerSpielvogel Bates, a Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co. unit. Staffers atGrey Advertising are permitted to take U.S. business tripsonly in emergencies. Because of its curbs on overseas travel,TBWA has installed extra fascimile machines and held threemeetings by videoconference this week.   One British-born Saatchi executive thinks Americans areoverreacting to terrorism fears. In New York last week, hefound U.S. colleagues canceling business trips betweenPittsburgh and Cincinnati. Iraqis &quot;don't even know wherePittsburgh is,&quot; he quips.                                                                                                          Agriculture                                                                                                          Crop prices have risen since the war began, partly becauselower oil prices ease fears that food-importing nations won'tbe able to afford U.S. crops. Grain traders in Chicago arealso bidding up prices on the bet that the U.S.-led alliancewill win the war fairly quickly -- and that the U.S. wouldthen use its food stockpiles to both reward allies and repairIraq.   Many farmers, however, are keeping their spring plantingplans flexible to see how the war is going, says Alan Kemper,a Lafayette, Ind., farmer and executive at the National CornGrowers Association. If oil facilities are damaged and oilprices soar, some Midwest farmers might shift more acres intosoybeans, which don't require much petroleum-basedfertilizer. Others are mulling whether to plant more corn forprocessing into ethanol, a gasoline substitute.                                                                                                          Airlines                                                                                                          Most carriers stopped flying to Israel and other Mideastlocations earlier this month after aircraft insurance ratesjumped 20-fold for some destinations. Last week, underwriterstold carriers they are reviewing rates for European flightsfor possible increases.   Some carriers also have cut service to Europe because ofsecurity concerns and light traffic. Trans World Airlinesannounced plans to cut half its European flights, and Pan AmCorp., has stopped flying to Athens. Other carriers, such asDelta Air Lines and NWA Inc.'s Northwest, may follow suit ifinsurance rates go up.   The Federal Aviation Administration has asked airlines tobeef up security. The new measures are expected to increasetotal industry costs by $150 million a year.   Jet-fuel prices eased right after war began, but the lossof significant oil fields in the Gulf region could sendprices soaring.                                                                                                          Automobiles                                                                                                          New-car sales are &quot;softening from a soft situation,&quot; saysMartin Swig, owner of a San Francisco auto center. Anotherrough indicator of consumer jitters: Attendance at the recentNorth American International Auto Show in Detroit fell 15%from a year ago.   &quot;The Gulf conflict leaves everything up in the air,&quot; saysDennis J. Gormley, chairman of Federal-Mogul Corp., a bigauto-parts maker. U.S. auto output may sink this quarter tothe lowest first-period level since the 1982 recession.   The Big Three domestic auto makers face serious cashsqueezes and are scrambling to pare costs. Ford Motor Co. andGeneral Motors Corp. are pressuring suppliers to cut prices.Chrysler Corp. executives raised their internalcost-reduction goal by 20% to $3 billion.   Demand for war supplies is boosting business for a few BigThree operations. GM's Allison transmission operations inIndianapolis are working overtime on emergency orders forheavy-duty gearboxes used in tanks and other Army vehicles.                                                                                                          Basic Materials                                                                                                          Specialty-steel producers stand to benefit the mostbecause their high-alloy, corrosion-resistent metal is usedin everything from aircraft carriers to submarines. Althoughthere's been no rush of new orders, Allegheny Ludlum Corp. isexpediting delivery for certain alloys for the aerospace andtank industries. Overall, the steel industry expects only asmall increase, 1% or so, in demand for the metal, mostly fordefense-related work.   Aluminum producers expect increased orders from aircraftmakers, for repair and new production, but that businessgenerates only about 3% of industry shipments. Producersworry that supplies could be crimped in case they must shutdown smelters in Bahrain, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.Reynolds Metals Co. is supplying a portable, recyclableplastic highway called &quot;Geoweb&quot; to the military to help heavytrucks cross the desert sand, and also 120 miles of &quot;assaultpipe&quot; to serve as a temporary conduit for fuel and drinkingwater.   Gold prices rallied when shooting erupted last week, butthe war's impact on prices has been negative. And goldbullion sales by central banks have pulled prices down. &quot;TheArab governments have sold bullion to finance the conflict,&quot;notes industry analyst John Tumazos. The Soviets, hebelieves, are selling &quot;anything that isn't nailed down,&quot;including gold.                                                                                                          Chemicals                                                                                                          Like most chemical makers, St. Louis-based Monsanto Co.has seen its profit margins squeezed since the Iraqi invasionin August. Fearing runaway crude oil prices, the companystarted loading up on raw material supplies late last year.   Now, it's waiting to find out whether that was a smart betor whether it will have to try to unload large inventories ofchemicals made from high-priced petroleum. &quot;We are workingwith major uncertainties,&quot; says a Monsanto spokesman.   Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., barred employees fromtraveling to the Middle East or North Africa. It alsoinstructed U.S.-based employees to return from the MiddleEast and relocated more than a dozen people who were managingdistribution facilities in &quot;potential danger zones.&quot;                                                                                                          Computers                                                                                                          Most computer companies haven't seen any real effect fromthe war so far. A spate of better-than-expected earningsreports -- from International Business Machines Corp.,Digital Equipment Corp., Apple Computer Corp., Data GeneralCorp. and others -- has cast a rosy light on the industrylately. And computer makers say January is typicallylackluster, so they warn that any softness in sales shouldn'tbe attributed to the Gulf situation.   In general, companies note that the computer industry isdriven by product cycles and general economic conditions. &quot;Wearen't insulated from world events, but we're probably a bitmore protected than some other industries,&quot; says a spokesmanfor Electronic Data Systems Corp., a GM unit that helpsinstall and operate big computer systems.   Egghead Inc., the large Issaquah, Wash., softwareretailer, reports a jump in sales of computer games thatinvolve war, especially war in the Middle East. The threebiggest gainers are F-15 Strike Eagle II, F-19 StealthFighter and M-1 Tank Platoon, all made by MicroProse SoftwareInc., Hunt Valley, Md. Sales of the three games have jumped40% in the past week, Egghead says.                                                                                                          Defense Contractors                                                                                                          Basking in the glow of the performance of their high-techweapons, military contractors are confident that OperationDesert Storm will improve their fortunes over both the shortand long terms.   The Pentagon has already called on the makers of certainmunitions to speed up production to supply the war effort. Inparticular, Raytheon Co., which makes the Patriotanti-missile system, and Martin Marietta Corp., which isRaytheon's principal subcontractor on the Patriot, have beenordered by the military to work round-the-clock building thesystem. American Body Armor andamp; Equipment Inc., meanwhile, hasincreased production of protective body armor to meet theneeds of U.S. forces. And the stock price of AlliantTechsystems Inc., based in Minnetonka, Minn., jumped nearly50% this week; the company makes ammo for the Army's M1A1tank.   Few executives expect the war to result in big increasesin the Pentagon budget; in fact, its cost may ultimately cutinto procurement funds. Nonetheless, weapons used so far inthe Gulf have made a case for the value of advancedtechnology on the battlefield, and that's likely to helpdefense firms when they go to the government seeking researchdollars for the next generation of arms.                                                                                                          Entertainment                                                                                                          Iraq has quickly replaced the Soviet Union as the enemy ofchoice in Hollywood spy thrillers and action adventures.   Some producers rushed to insert Iraq into existing plotsand others created new movies. &quot;The Human Shield,&quot; made byCannon Pictures Inc., is loosely based on the Iraqi seizureof hostages last year.   Except for the first two days, the war hasn't hurtbox-office results. &quot;January has been a very good month,&quot;says John N. Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., a researchfirm. &quot;People wanted a little bit of escapism.&quot; On Jan. 16,receipts were off about 25% from the previous Wednesday, hesays. The second day, receipts were off just 10%.   Home video apparently hasn't been affected, but theconflict already has found its way into a few TV shows.&quot;Major Dad,&quot; the half-hour situation comedy broadcast on CBSInc.'s network, will air an episode Feb. 4 that deals withthe war. &quot;A Different World,&quot; a sitcom on General ElectricCo.'s NBC network, broadcast a show Jan. 10 that dealt withthe possibility of war.   The ABC unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. yanked an episodeof &quot;Under Cover,&quot; a new action-adventure series about ahusband and wife who work for a CIA-type organization. It wasset in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.   Despite bigger audiences, the broadcast networks may losemore than $100 million in second-quarter advertisingcommitments. Meanwhile, ABC, CBS and NBC say they're eachspending over $1 million a week to cover war news.   Theme parks also may suffer. &quot;The war will discourageforeign tourists from flying in to the U.S,&quot; says LisbethBarron, an analyst at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co.                                                                                                          Health Care                                                                                                          The Defense Department increased orders in the past fewmonths for medicines and supplies such as antibiotics, bloodbags, artificial blood products, intravenous solutions,bandages and sutures. Baxter International Inc., based inDeerfield, Ill., says it has occasionally added work shiftsin recent weeks to fill orders for intravenous products.   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association says thereare shortages of an anti-malaria drug and gammaglobulin, ablood product used to prevent hepatitis A, for civilian usein the U.S. because of large military demand. But supplies ofdrugs for common medical problems are plentiful.   Emergency room medical staffs have been stretched thin atsome hospitals because doctors in the reserves have beencalled to duty. The call-up of reserves has been hard onrural areas, where doctors are already in short supply.Verdigre, Neb., a community of 620, lost its one doctor threeweeks ago to the call-up.   Jordan Hospital in Plymouth, Mass., is among severalhospitals that have started counseling services for familieswith relatives in the Gulf.                                                                                                          Hotels and Casinos                                                                                                          The war may cause a short-term decline in hotel occupancydomestically and abroad if tourism and business travel dropssignificantly because of terrorist threats or an increase inoil prices. Already, some areas such as New York and LasVegas have shown weakness.   However, while the shock of going to war may hurt businessover the next week or so, hotels and casinos aren't lookingfor long-term disruptions in business. Says Glenn Schaeffer,executive vice president of Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. ofLas Vegas: &quot;There's no question that this dampens consumerconfidence, but that doesn't affect the fundamentals.&quot;   Housing                                                                                                          Analysts expect lower profits in the housing business thisyear after a dismal 1990. But several big builders inCalifornia, the largest new-home market, posted a surprisingsales jump after the war broke out.   Fieldstone Group, an Orange County builder, had &quot;the bestweek we've had since Aug. 2&quot; when Iraq invaded Kuwait, saysChairman Peter Ochs. &quot;People are coming off the sidelines.&quot;Despite this early surge, Fieldstone will build 1,200 unitsthis year, down from 1,300 last year.   Randall Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes,San Bernardino, Calif., says unit sales are up 20% since warerupted. &quot;It was like the initial reaction of the stockmarket, we were very surprised. I don't know if it willcontinue.&quot;                                                                                                          Oil                                                                                                          Oil prices have softened since the outbreak of war, andthat may weaken exploration and production profitsshort-term.   But oil prices have been volatile since Iraq's invasion ofKuwait last August, and that's likely to persist. Industryinvestment in petrochemical operations continues to lag ashigh oil prices crimp profit margins and the recessionfurther shrinks demand.                                                                                                          Retailing                                                                                                          Retailers took a big hit in the first 48 hours offighting. &quot;Everyone was glued to their television sets. Theydidn't have time to go out shopping,&quot; says Jack McMillan,president of Nordstrom Inc. &quot;You could have bowled in here,&quot;says an appliance salesman at a Sears store in Chicago.   Spiegel Inc., a catalog retailer, felt the impact mostduring the first 2 1/2 hours of the war: Call volume at itsmain catalog-order center in Bensalem, Pa., dropped 50%, thenbounced back after President Bush's televised speech thatnight. Since then, a spokesman says &quot;it has fluctuated,depending on whether things seem to be going well or whetherthey seem confusing.&quot; Shoppers returned over the weekend,drawn by clearance sales.   The industry's conventional wisdom: A short war will boostconsumer confidence, triggering sales of everything fromdresses to roller blades, but a prolonged, bloody war wouldhurt sales. Consumer confidence is already at its lowestsince 1982.   At the moment, demand is brisk for flags and otherpatriotic fare, gas masks, desert camouflage clothing, U.S.military pilots' sunglasses, TV sets and radios -- especiallyshort-wave models -- and books, globes and maps of the MiddleEast.   In Chicago, Rand McNally andamp; Co.'s two map and travel storessold out of Middle East maps the first day of fighting --less than two hours after receiving shipments of 100 mapseach. At a Kmart discount store in West Babylon, N.Y., yellowribbon suitable for outdoor use sold out before clerks couldtransfer it from a stockroom cart to a permanent display.                                                                                                          Security Firms                                                                                                          Some of the biggest players in the $6 billion-a-yearsecurity industry say they have seen a dramatic increase inbusiness since the outbreak of hostilities.   At Wackenhut Corp. in Miami, Robert Kneip, senior vicepresident for planning and development, says there was an&quot;appreciable&quot; increase in business in the days immediatelypreceding Jan. 15, though most of the requests were simplyfor additional guard services. With the start of combat,however, the company is beginning to see requests for moresophisticated &quot;vulnerability assessments&quot;: studies of how acompany's entire operations could be susceptible to securitythreats.   Mr. Kneip says it is still too early to quantifyWackenhut's increase in business. He adds: &quot;I don't know howmuch will be sustained business or one-time reactions. But if{the U.S.} is in the Gulf for the long-haul, I expect asustained impact on revenues.&quot;   At Pinkerton's Inc. in Van Nuys, Calif., Pete Sawyers,director of marketing, says the company has seen a&quot;tremendous&quot; increase in demand for security officers. Amongthose seeking additional officers, Mr. Sawyers says, are oilcompanies, public facilities (such as sports stadiums),religious groups and transportation concerns with operationsin the Gulf.   Some analysts, however, say many companies took theirextra precautions some time ago, and that the securityindustry as a whole hasn't benefited substantially fromevents in the past week.                                                                                                          Shipping                                                                                                          Orders have all but dried up for ocean tankers, promptingmany tanker companies to shelve expansion plans for now.&quot;Ship owners have stopped making long-range plans,&quot; says PaulSlater, chairman of a Naples, Fla., ship-leasing company.   Despite soaring war-risk insurance rates, some shipcompanies are still trading in the northern Persian Gulf andSuez Canal regions and passing along the higher costs tocustomers.   A surge in military cargo to supply U.S. troops is helpingfill ships. &quot;We're stretched thin,&quot; says W.J. Amoss Jr.,chairman and chief executive of New Orleans-based Lykes Bros.Steamship Co., where nine of 30 cargo vessels are charteredto the Military Sealift Command to haul cargo to the PersianGulf. Some rail-shipping companies report increased militarytraffic, and several air-cargo firms say there's more spacefor their goods because many passengers are forgoing airtravel.                                                                                                          Small Business                                                                                                          The departure of owners, top managers or key employees formilitary duty in the Gulf is hurting many small businesses.Meanwhile, some would-be entrepreneurs see opportunity.   Michael Lenzini, head of a small-business developmentcenter in Westminster, Colo., reports a surge in war-relatedinquiries from those wanting to sell boots, binoculars,night-vision devices and other items.   Military-supply niches too small to appeal to bigcompanies are yielding a windfall for some small businesses.Oregon Freeze Dry Inc., a closely-held maker of dried meatsin Albany, Ore., just landed its biggest contract in 25 yearsas a military supplier.   And another sewing crew has been added at Central ValleyProfessional Service of Modesto, Calif., to accommodate arecent Defense Department order for 20,000 body bags. &quot;It'skind of a rush-rush contract,&quot; says co-owner Lee Vaughn.                                                                                                          Sports                                                                                                          Sunday's Super Bowl XXV is on -- for now. &quot;We expect toplay it as scheduled, but we will take events in the MiddleEast into account right up to kickoff,&quot; says Greg Aiello,communications director for the National Football League. TheNFL has never canceled a game because of external events, butif Gulf action flares this weekend, ABC could scrap its SuperBowl broadcast for news coverage. Pro football commissionerPaul Tagliabue then could decide that the pre-emption and thepall of war dictate postponement.   Security is extremely tight at Tampa Stadium, where aFederal Bureau of Investigation SWAT team is on standby andspectators will be scanned by metal detactors and barred fromtaking in radios, TVs, cameras, or other electronicequipment. The National Basketball Association is&quot;re-evaluating&quot; its All-Star game weekend in Charlotte, N.C.,on Feb. 8 to 10, says a spokesman.   Some members of the U.S. Ski Team, evacuated from Europelast week, are returning this week for world alpinechampionships in Saalbach, Austria.                                                                                                          Telecommunications                                                                                                          Since the Middle East conflict began, CommunicationsSatellite Corp. of Washington, D.C., which transmits phonetraffic overseas via satellite, says its affiliates added &quot;atremendous number of satellite circuits -- about 800 --between the U.S. and the Mideast&quot; at the request of phonecompanies ATandamp;T and MCI Communications Corp. The satellitecarrier also added about 12,000 high-speed data channels,many of which are being used by the Pentagon.   ATandamp;T reports enormous increases in phone traffic since theoutbreak of war. At the company's Bedminster, N.J., networkoperations center, officials were stunned as thetwo-story-high video wall in the network war room flashedbrilliantly after the first news reports of war. &quot;Our networkguys saw spikes on the screen showing increases in traffic ofseveral thousand percent above normal,&quot; says an ATandamp;Tspokesman.   ATandamp;T's international teleconferencing services also haveseen a huge increase in usage as companies choose to keeptheir employees off the road. &quot;Traffic has increased 75%since the war broke out,&quot; he said.   Customer sales representatives at Atlanta-based BellSouthCorp.'s local telephone service units report an increase indemand for call-waiting and three-way calling. &quot;If a soldiercalls home, families don't want to miss the call,&quot; aspokesman says.                                                                                                          Utilities                                                                                                          Utilities are generally unfazed by the war. &quot;What'sextremely important to keep in mind is that the utilityindustry has been very successful in moving away from areliance on oil -- particularly imported oil -- so the shockyou saw in 1973 has just not happened,&quot; says Gregory Enholm,utility analyst for Salomon Brothers. At Potomac ElectricPower Co. in Washington, D.C., for example, spokesman SteveArabia says the company now depends on oil for only about 10%of its fuel needs.   Much of the industry's confidence, however, rests on theassumption that the war will be a short and successful one.&quot;Nobody seems to be planning on a loss of supply&quot; of oil,says Barry Abramson at Prudential Bache Research.   ---        War's Impact: Initial Stock Market Reaction                                                                                                          Best- and worst-performing industry groups (plus theperformance of other selected groups) based on percentagechange Jan. 16-24, 1991                                                                                                          Air Freight                          16.5%   Airlines                             14.7   Savings andamp; Loans                      14.4   Trucking                             14.3   Biotechnology                        11.7   Textile/Apparel                      11.6   Home Builders                        11.4   Industrial Technology                11.2   Banks                                10.7   Containers                           10.5   Office Equipment                     10.5   Heavy Construction                   10.2   Oil-Field Equipment                  10.2   Computers                             9.7   Aerospace/Defense                     9.5   Food Retailers                        9.5   Beverages                             9.3   Home Furnishings                      8.9   Software                              8.9   Securities Brokers                    8.5   Chemicals                             8.1   Marine Transportation                 7.6   Food                                  6.0   Media                                 5.8   DJ Equity Index                       5.8   Entertainment                         5.0   Financial Services                    5.0   Lodging                               4.8   Health Care                           4.7   Water Utilities                       4.5   Autos                                 4.3   Diversified Technology                4.0   Communications                        3.7   Aluminum                              3.5   Oil Drilling                          3.2   Gas Utilities                         3.0   Pipelines                             2.8   Electric Utilities                    2.7   Major Oil Companies                   2.7   Steel                                 1.9   Secondary Oil Companies               1.4   Casinos                               1.1   Telephone Systems                     0.6   Mining                               -3.9   Coal                                 -4.1   Precious Metals                     -10.6</TEXT></DOC>
