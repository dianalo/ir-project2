Guerrillas loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk retreated along withcivilians Thursday to the outskirts of the town, Stoung, in KompongThom province, said spokesman Roland Eng.   He said government forces had rained artillery and multiplerocket launchers for two days, and some civilians were hurt.   Neither side held Stoung today, but some guerrillas havereturned there, Eng said in a telephone interview from his Bangkokoffice.   The guerrillas said they took Stoung on April 12, and since usedit as an administrative and communications base for wide areas ofthe province they have seized.   Eng denied a statement from the Vietnamese-installed governmentthat it had retaken Stoung last Sunday.   Stoung is only about 95 miles north of the national capital,Phnom Penh. It was the most populated town under guerrilla controlwith tens of thousands of residents.   Sihanouk's forces are allied in a guerrilla coalition with thecommunist Khmer Rouge and the non-communist fighters of formerPrime Minster Son Sann. They are fighting the government Vietnaminstalled in Phnom Penh after invading the country in late 1978 totopple a Khmer Rouge government.   Sihanouk said Thursday his forces were more determined than everto fight after the U.S. announced a day earlier that it waswithdrawing recognition of the coalition's seat at the UnitedNations.   The U.S. shift was prompted by fears of a return to power of theKhmer Rouge, the strongest rebel force. While in power from1975-78, hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of aradical program to turn the country into an agrarian commune.</TEXT></DOC>
