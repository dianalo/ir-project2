Schulman, former president of Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Inc., was convicted of conspiracy and mail fraud in his second criminal trial related to the firm's 1985 collapse.    In May, Mr. Schulman, the only former executive of the defunct brokerage firm to plead innocent in the government's case, was convicted of three tax-related felonies; a federal jury was deadlocked on 21 other counts. The government then re-indicted him on four felonies --conspiracy to commit mail fraud and three counts of mail fraud -- related to a scheme to defraud customers who entered into repurchase agreements with the firm.    The jury convicted Mr. Schulman, who turns 40 years old next week, of those four counts yesterday after a day of deliberations.    Mr. Schulman's lawyer, Barry H. Evenchick, said: &quot;The jury's spoken. I'm obviously disappointed.&quot; He said he expects to appeal both of the jury convictions.    The collapse of Livingston, N.J.-based Bevill and its Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Asset Management Corp. unit in April 1985 rocked the government-securities market and cost scores of banks, municipalities and other customers as much as $150 million, the government says.    Yesterday, the federal jury found that Mr. Schulman had conspired with other Bevill executives to defraud buyers of the firm's repurchase agreements -- in which a firm sells a customer securities that it agrees to buy back later at a higher price -- by selling nonexistent securities, or selling the same securities to more than one customer.    In addition to the maximum 11 years in prison he faces on the tax counts, Mr. Schulman faces a maximum 20 years on the new convictions, in addition to $1 million in fines. U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise set a Sept. 9 sentencing date for Mr. Schulman and for four other former Bevill executives who earlier pleaded guilty in the case. </TEXT></DOC>
