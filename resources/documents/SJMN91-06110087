They have already sent a copyof the letter to Brennan but plan to deliver the letter with the signaturesMonday.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  STAFF CUT IS PROTESTED AT SJS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Evans, who is in charge of collecting the signatures, was away from campusThursday, but Heisch said the response to the letter has been &quot;major.&quot;;    Towhich Brennan responded, &quot;No one has ever contacted me or called me to tell methey were concerned about that particular decision (on Zimmerman). I have noreal reaction to their letter, because I can't react to a single issue that'sdevoid of the whole.&quot;;    In addition to Zimmerman, Brennan dismissedAssistant Athletic Directors Marshall Clark and Debbie Pinkston in what hetermed a cost-cutting measure that will decrease the number of associate orassistant positions from seven to four.;    Zimmerman, whose contract expiresat the end of the academic year, could not be reached for comment Thursday.;   But her dismissal has confounded her colleagues, especially since she hasraised nearly $1 million over 10 years as primary coordinator for theimmensely popular Walk for the Women of Sparta. She also has been the primaryfund-raiser for a new softball facility.;    &quot;There are frankly a lot ofthings you can do to fix a budget crisis that wouldn't require getting rid ofMary Zimmerman,&quot; Heisch said. &quot;I have to question (Brennan's) judgment andsensitivity.&quot;;    One of Heisch and Evans' primary concerns is that newlyhired Associate Athletic Director Dan Curry will take over as coordinator ofThe Walk, which has been traditionally organized by women. But Brennan says hewill seek recommendations from women faculty and staff members for a neworganizer for The Walk.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANNETTE JOHN-HALL, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910419  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  339  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 19, 199100110087,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
