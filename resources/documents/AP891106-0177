Judge Orders Full Translations For Immigrants in Court</HEAD><DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge ruled Monday thatimmigration court proceedings must be translated in full fornon-English speakers facing deportation and exclusion hearings.   U.S. District Judge William Gray ruled that the current policy,which provides only for translation of questions to non-Englishspeakers and their responses, violates statutory and constitutionalrights.   Sandra Pettit of the Legal Aid Foundation said the ruling willgive those facing such hearings the ability to understand andparticipate.   ``The proceeding won't be something that is just done to them,''she said.   Gray rejected a request by government lawyers that the ruling beput on hold while they appealed, Ms. Pettit said.   Ms. Pettit represents two refugee rights groups, El Rescate andthe Central American Refugee Center and five individuals, three ofwhom speak Spanish and two Farsi, the main language in Iran.   All five were involved in immigration proceedings, and in March1988 filed suit claiming that immigration court proceedings wereincompletely and poorly translated.   The suit was filed against the Executive Office of ImmigrationReview, the branch of the Justice Department that overseesimmigration courts, as well as others including U.S. AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh.   Gray granted a summary judgment on their claim that thetranslations were incomplete. A second claim, that courtinterpreters are poorly trained and unqualified, likely will go totrial early next year, Ms. Pettit said.</TEXT></DOC>
