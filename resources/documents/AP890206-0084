Boyden Gray, is resigning as chairman of a multimillion-dollarcommunications company to avoid any appearance of conflict ofinterest, the White House said today.   Gray, Bush's official legal counsel since 1981, previously hadsaid he would remain as chairman of the family-owned SummitCommunications Group, Inc. but would refuse a salary.   He resigned, effective today, after consulting with the heads ofBush's new ethics commission, said White House Press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater.   Fitzwater said the action was prompted in part by news accountsover the weekend in The New York Times and The Washington Post thatpointed out that the Reagan White House had a policy that forbadeemployees from serving in such chairmanships or earnign outsideincome.   Fitzwater said there would have been ``nothing inappropriate''about Gray keeping the post in the Bush administration. But he saidGray was advised to resign by former Attorney General Griffin Belland federal appeals Judge Malcolm Wilkie, chairman and vicechairman, respectively, of the newly created President's Commissionon Federal Ethics Law Reform.   ``The duties of the White House counsel are sufficiently broadthat it would be constructive to resign such a directorship to avoidany possibility of even the appearance of conflict,'' Fitzwater toldreporters.   He said Gray also would be putting his personal assets into ablind trust. The Washington Post estimated Gray's investments at $10million.   Bush has made a major point in his presidency of stressing highethical standards for government employees, and said he wantstougher ethical rules than those he inherited from his predecessor,President Reagan.   ``Boyden Gray has the president's highest trust and confidenceand he will remain the primary adviser to the presidnet on ethicalmatters,'' Fitzwater said.   Bush was aware that every year for the past eight years when Grayworked for him as vice president the Office of Government Ethicsreviewed and approved Gray's financial disclosure forms, he said.   The Reagan White House had a policy that no White House officialsshould accept outside earned income or serve on the boards ofoutside corporations, Frank Q. Nebeker, director of the Office ofGovernment Ethics, said Sunday. This policy was mentioned in a 1983written advisory opinion by the ethics office that was distributedto all government ethics officials, including Gray, the Times said.   Gray was not bound by those rules when he worked for the vicepresident, whose policy was more lenient, and he was paid severalhundred thousand dollars over the eight years for serving aschairman of the company that owns at least a dozen radio stationsand has about 130,000 cable subscribers in the South.   He reported the income on his financial disclosure forms. Morerecent forms have also disclosed payments for his work asco-executor of the estate of his father, who died in 1982.   Gray told the newspapers that he stopped accepting payment fromSummit for his work at the beginning of the year.   ``Due to my promotion and due to the policies enunciated by(Bush) during the presidential campaign, I cannot and I will nottake outside income and so have instructed the family company,'' hesaid.   Bush made a campaign pledge in July that his appointees would notaccept any outside income, but he did not address the problem ofserving on outside corporations' boards.   Last week, Bush appointed an eight-member commission to reviewgovernment ethical standards, including conflict-of-interest law.Bush has not yet named a White House ethics officer, but Gray hasbeen serving informally in that role since before the inauguration.   Gray, who has an unpublished telephone number, could not bereached for comment Sunday, according to the White House. Hisdeputy, John P. Schmitz, as suffering from back problems and wasunavailable, said Schmitz' mother.   Gray told the Post that he has avoided conflict-of-interestproblems by recusing himself since 1981 from any matters concerningcommunications. He also said he had no conflict because he was notSummit's chief executive or operating officer. He said he devotedfour to six days a year to overseeing the company.   Ninty-three percent of the company's stock is owned by a trustadministered by Gray and his brothers, the Times reported.   Nebeker declined to say what Gray should do about hischairmanship of Summit to meet White House ethics standards, saying:``I'm not prepared to make any suggestions to him at all.''   Peter F. Watson, who worked with Gray on presidential transitionmatters, defended Gray on Sunday.   ``All I can say is, during the several meetings I participated inwith him and his staff dealing with ethics issues, I have never seenanybody more concerned not only with strict compliance with ethicsissues but indeed, nobody was more sensitive as to the appearanceissues as well,'' Watson said.   ``Specific communications issues did come up during transitionand he immediately advised everyone in the room that he was not tobe involved in those issues,'' said Watson, an attorney who nowworks for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. ``I personallywitnessed him removing himself from any deliberations forappointments on the FCC.''   Timothy Muris, who worked on the FCC transition, also attestedSunday to Gray's recusal from communications matters. ``Boyden neverhad any conversations with me about the FCC,'' he said.   Nebeker said he met with Gray on numerous occasions after theNovember election and before the inauguration to discuss mattersconcerning ethics and Gray's financial disclosure.   ``I apprised him of the existence of the 15 percent rule,'' a lawunder which officials above a certain salary are prohibited fromearning an amount equal to more than 15 percent of their governmentsalary in outside earned income such as wages or other compensation,Nebeker said. Interest and dividends are not included.   Nebeker said that while Gray had not been at that level before,``he's at it now'' because his salary has increased.</TEXT></DOC>
