Michael Gully, directorof VA's field operations service in the Office of Medical IRM.andM;DHCP is VA's hospital information system, which provides automation for VAadministrative, personnel and health care programs.andM;VA contracting officials are eager to issue the RFP before year's end, GullySaid.andP;  Award of the contract could come in late 1992 with delivery of thefirst equipment by early 1993.andM;The procurement will replace VA's original DHCP equipment, which waspurchased in 1982 and distributed throughout VA's largest hospitals,including Washington, Philadelphia and Hines, Ill.andP;  In 1988, the equipmentwas redistributed to 78 small, remote hospitals.andM;At the same time, to meet the larger hospitals' ADP needs, VA awarded a $100million contract to Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  That buy brought the hospitalsDEC's PDP-1144 and 1184 CPUs, the VAX 8500 and MicroVAX 3000 series, plusperipherals.andM;The General Services Administration last month classified the procurement asa review priority system.andP;  Such systems typically are complex, cost more than$50 million and likely will have a major impact on a department's mission.andM;Gully said VA will cooperate in every way with GSA.andP;  The high-profile DHCPwill require GSA approval for several phases of the procurement, includingsolicitation evaluations, post-bid and pre-award briefings, as well as annualreviews of the contract's status.andM;DHCP provides medical centers with an integrated patient database that hasbeen standardized in 167 of VA's 172 hospitals.andP;  It consists of modulessupporting medical administration, pharmacy and clinical laboratoryoperations.andM;The next generation of DHCP will place greater emphasis on use of the systemby clinicians, Gully said.andP;  One new feature includes integrating graphicswith X-rays and CAT scans.andM;VA's chief medical director, James W. Holsinger, Jr., has said he will makedevelopment of advanced DHCP applications a high priority.andM;&quot;In the VA, powerful, full-function workstations will be commonplace whereverhospital workers have a need,&quot; he said this summer.andP;  &quot;We need to capitalizeon harnessing information resources technology for meeting the future needsof VA.&quot;andM;VA is expected to receive $82 million in fiscal 1991 to support personnel andoperations.andM;DHCP runs Mumps, a medical management information system programming languagedeveloped at Massachusetts General Hospital.andP;  VA programmers developed DHCPin phases, based on individual medical center needs.andM;All DHCP applications are integrated under Mumps by system support software.andO;The system support software handles menus, files, security devices andelectronic-mail functions.andM;Unlike top-down systems, DHCP has a standard database, called the kernel,that is located at each of the hospitals.andP;  The user modules hang off thekernel.andP;  This architecture has allowed VA to install applications when andwhere they are needed.andM;All but five of VA's hospitals use DHCP.andP;  Those five have been set aside aspermanent test beds for a separate ADP project, the Integrated HospitalSystems program.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
