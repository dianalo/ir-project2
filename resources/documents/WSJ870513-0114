The Conservative Party, which wants to partition the country between blacks and whites, replaced the liberal Progressive Federalists as the official opposition. But a more careful analysis of the results leads to a totally different interpretation.    Overall support for State President P.W. Botha's ruling National Party remained at just over 50%. But he now has a far different constituency. He picked up support from former liberals and lost right-wing supporters to the conservatives. Right-wing parties won 29% of the vote and the liberals only 16% -- almost exactly the opposite of the 1981 outcome. But Mr. Botha now has a constituency that, on balance, is considerably more liberal than before. It includes, for example, more voters of English descent than it does Afrikaners.    The Progressives slipped badly in part because they attacked apartheid without clearly outlining the alternative they favored. The National Party's slogan (&quot;Reform -- Yes, Surrender -- No&quot;) appealed to English-speaking whites who want to cast off apartheid, but not at the price of living in the kind of Marxist, one-party state the African National Congress would install if it ever should gain power. If Mr. Botha wants to keep those new National Party voters he will have to implement reforms.    Liberals gained status in other ways. The Progressives won control of the Johannesburg City Council for the first time ever. Challenges mounted by three anti-apartheid defectors from the National Party fared very well. Running in key Afrikaner areas, they won one seat, ran close in another and came within 39 disputed votes of defeating the minister for constitutional reform.    Mr. Botha called an election two years early in order to secure a &quot;mandate&quot; from white voters. The question now is, for what? Up until early last year, he was moving toward reform. The abolition of the hated pass laws -- which limited black freedom of movement -- was the most obvious signal. Then the pressure for sanctions in the U.S. reached the boiling point and he dug in his heels. His resistance to Commonwealth intervention was understandable given the meddlesome attitude of those pressing it. But he also severely limited political and press freedoms and he has shied away from the recommendation of his own President's Council to scrap the Group Areas Act, which defines where different racial groups may live.    Mr. Botha's defenders maintain that he still wants genuine reform and not just cosmetic changes, but that first he had to convince white voters that change wouldn't come at the expense of civil order. That is why his campaign emphasized defiance of the outside world and a police crackdown at home. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of six million Zulus, recently said &quot;the issue after the election will be, which shoulder President Botha looks over -- the right or the left.&quot; Now that he has won power again, he must decide how to respond to that challenge. As The Economist magazine put it: &quot;If Mr. Botha is serious about change, he will have to fight Afrikanerdom's right wing, not appease it.&quot;    Two litmus tests are obvious. Mr. Botha soon must decide whether or not to allow a local referendum on the Indaba, a proposed multiracial constitution for Natal based on universal suffrage and a bill of rights. If implemented, this would give Natal, with a quarter of South Africa's population, a genuine black-majority government at the local level. A successful Indaba could provide a model for other parts of South Africa.    Mr. Botha also must rule on the fate of the Group Areas Act. Violations of the act are rampant, but there were only four prosecutions under it in 1986, one in 1985 and none the year before. A recent poll by the Afrikaans newspaper Rapport found that only 27% of surveyed whites want the act retained. More than 24% want it scrapped completely, while another 34% want each local community or property owner to decide who can rent or buy housing.    If Mr. Botha fails to act on the Group Areas Act and the Indaba he will have passed up an opportunity to fulfill his promises for further reform. The U.S., for its part, might consider that it has gained nothing from sanctions and disinvestment, which have served the cause of those who are promoting radical solutions more than the efforts of those who are seeking peaceful reform. It would be helpful if the U.S. could move back toward a more constructive policy, supporting such ideas as a Natal Indaba and thereby giving backing to responsible moderates such as Chief Buthelezi. That kind of approach is far more likely to promote a peaceful solution to South Africa's racial strife than further moral posturing. The process only can begin with a correct understanding of what happened in the South African elections. </TEXT></DOC>
