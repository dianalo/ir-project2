Thecompany requested an investigation by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) to determine the extent of employee exposureto formaldehyde. Investigators from NIOSH conducted an initial environmentalsurvey of the facilities in April 1982 and a follow-up environmentalsurvey in June 1982. In the areas used to reprocess dialyzers, they collectedair samples to analyze for formaldehyde in the personal breathing zonesof workers. The results showed that workers at two of the three facilitiesinvolved were exposed to formaldehyde concentrations of 0.50 and 0.57parts per million (ppm), respectively, as a time-weighted average (TWA).The current Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard establishesa permissible exposure of 3 ppm, 8-hour TWA; NIOSH recommends minimizingworkplace exposure levels and limiting exposure levels and limiting exposureto the lowest feasible level.</TEXT></DOC>
