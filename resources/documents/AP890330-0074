(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A highly infectious disease iswiping out millions of young lake trout in hatcheries and could setback the effort to restock the Great Lakes with the game fish foryears, officials say.   ``The best thing we can do now is eradicate all of the fish atinfected hatcheries, disinfect and start over,'' Dr. TerenceBradley, a University of Rhode Island researcher leading the troutherpes study, said Wednesday.   The Great Lakes Fishery Commission agrees, recommending thatinfected hatcheries be withdrawn from stocking programs until theyare disease-free. The commission represents the Great Lakes states,Ontario and two Indian tribes.   Bradley and federal scientists believe the virus is new, showingup only in hatcheries in the past decade. It appears to kill onlyyoung fish, and poses no threat to humans.   Infected trout haven't been released into the wild, said JohnDriver, spokesman for a state hatchery in Marquette, Mich.Researchers are unsure how fast the disease can spread in a lake,where fish are less crowded and under less stress.   ``If we stock contaminated fish, nothing could happen _ or itcould wipe out the entire population of lake trout. It would be toolate then to say, `Whoops, we made a mistake,''' said JerryMcClain, manager of a federal hatchery in Iron River, Wis.   The loss of millions of young fish in hatcheries wouldn'timmediately affect sport fishermen in the Great Lakes, since theymust take older fish, but fishing would be affected in long run,officials said.   Three state hatcheries in Wisconsin and Michigan and the IronRiver hatchery lost their entire young lake trout populations tothe virus in the past two years. The Marquette hatchery alone haslost more than 4 million since the virus appeared in the early1980s.   In the most drastic move yet to stop the infection, the IronRiver hatchery killed its entire brood stock _ mature fish 10 to 15years old _ and started over this winter with eggs from Wyoming,McClain said.   State officials in Wisconsin and Michigan are considering doingthe same.   All of the affected hatcheries have undergone repeated partialdisinfection programs that so far have failed to stop the disease.   All it takes to reinfect a group of fish, Bradley said, ``is alittle bit of water from one tank to another tank _ maybe from afishnet or even an animal on the grounds. It is very difficult toeradicate.''</TEXT></DOC>
