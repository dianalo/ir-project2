The Tigre People's Liberation Front, one of the rebelorganizations fighting for autonomy in northern Ethiopia, announcedin London that it ``is prepared to take advantage of anypossibility, however small, to work for a peaceful solution.''   The Ethiopian Parliament adopted a peace plan June 5 calling forunconditional talks with insurgents in the presence of aninternational observer.   The Tigre rebels challenged the government to start negotiationswithin one month ``to minimize the continuing appalling human andmaterial costs of the war.''   But a larger insurgent group, the Eritrean People's LiberationFront that has been fighting for 28 years for independence of theprovince neighboring Tigre, has not responded to the governmentproposal.   President Mengistu Haile Mariam ordered the special session ofthe Parliament to consider the peace plan less than three weeksafter his Marxist government crushed a coup attempt by war-wearygenerals.   Diplomats said the attempted coup and its failure sent armymorale plunging to new depths, with the morale already low becauseof defeats in Tigre and Eritrea.   The Tigrean rebels, among Ethiopia's many ethnic minorities, wantrestoration of democratic rights, an immediate cease-fire, therelease of political prisoners and freedom for exiles to return.   Their peace plans also calls for dismantling of the government's``repressive security institutions,'' the expulsion of foreignmilitary forces, and creation of a provisional government from allpolitical organizations until a constitution is adopted and ademocratic government elected.   The Soviet Union is Mengistu's main backer, providing militaryaid and support.   Mengistu inherited the northern insurgencies from the regime ofEmperor Haile Selassie, who annexed the former Italian colony ofEritrea in 1962. Mengistu ousted Selassie in a coup in Sept. 12,1974.   Both the rebel groups and the government espouse Marxism.</TEXT></DOC>
