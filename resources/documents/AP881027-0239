The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was scheduledto meet several times this month to discuss controlling productionas a way to prop up worldwide oil prices, which have fallen sharplyin recent weeks.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 15 centsWednesday to settle at $13.41 a barrel, after rising 9 cents onTuesday. Other contract months also were higher.   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline closed at 51.67 cents agallon, down 0.27 cent. The contract had risen 1.98 cents onTuesday. The November contract for home heating oil, which rose 0.46cent in the previous session, closed up 1.19 cents at 41.55 cents agallon.   Analysts said the market had little reaction to a reportWednesday from the Islamic Republic news agency that Iran wouldcontinue to oppose an OPEC production quota for Iraq, its 8-year warfoe, equal to its own.   Iraq said recently it would maintain its production at a minimum2.7 million barrels per day, nearly double its assigned OPEC quota.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing its daily production toward 3 millionbarrels, well above its 2.3 million barrel quota.</TEXT></DOC>
