Hightower is proposing a plan to that certify beef ishormone-free based on guidelines from European Economic Communityveterinarians. He contends Texas suppliers and the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture could quickly meet the standards ``and regain thisexport market.''   ``This is, in essence, the same verification procedure used byall of our competitors for their sales of this specialty product toEuropean importers. If they can do it, we can do it better,''Hightower said.   The EEC has banned imports of hormone-treated beef because ofhealth concerns over the growth stimulants, cutting off a $100million market for U.S. producers. The United States retaliated bysetting $100 million in higher tariffs on a variety of Common Marketgoods.   USDA officials said they would not comment on Hightower's planuntil they review it. Jane Adams, a spokeswoman for the agency'sFood Safety and Inspection Service, said a copy of Hightower'sproposal had not been received by Tuesday afternoon.   But on Monday, acting Secretary Peter Myers said: ``The bottomline is here we have a trade representative trying to negotiate withEurope and one person trying to to their own thing. It doesn't helpour negotiation process.''   At his confirmation hearing last week, AgricultureSecretary-designate Clayton Yeutter said Hightower's actions wereundercutting U.S. efforts ``in a very major way'' and that it wouldhelp to have him ``on our side rather than their side.''   Myers, who is running USDA pending Yeutter's Senate confirmation,said he would have to review Hightower's proposal, but ``anything wedo will have to fit any packing company in the United States...ifand when we do it.''   Myers said Hightower ``obviously does things for politicalreasons, so you have to suspect what's going on.''   Hightower, a Democrat, contends he simply is trying to expandmarkets for Texas producers.   ``National leaders on both sides of the Atlantic should helpagriculture make trades, not war,'' Hightower said Tuesday.   Under Hightower's plan, producers would file federal affidavitscertifying their cattle were produced without artificial growthstimulants.   Texas beef shipped to Europe would receive the same USDAcertification now authorized for selling hormone and growthstimulant-free beef to U.S. customers, Hightower said.   USDA alao would perform urine and fecal tests on one of every2,000 live animals destined for European export to determine ifsynthetic hormones were present.   He said top European veterinary inspectors were in Austin, Texaslast week to review the EEC's new import regulations.   ``As we suspected, meeting the EEC's technical requirements turnout not to be the `impossible task' that USDA officials claimed itwas. Practically all of the verification procedures required by EECare either already being practiced by USDA or can easily beincorporated into their current practices,'' Hightower claimed.</TEXT></DOC>
