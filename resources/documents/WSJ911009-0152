That would be terrificwere it a sign that free nations are throwing wide theirdoors to all who come seeking liberty. It would also besplendid were it a byproduct of the fall of the communistregime in Hanoi.   It's too soon for any such good news. The Free Worldcontinues to hoard its passports. And for all the liberationin Moscow, Vietnam's communist regime stalks on, still&quot;re-educating&quot; its countrymen in the name of Marxistrevolution. The ugly reason that Vietnamese refugees mightsoon disappear from the camps of Southeast Asia is that theso-called Free World is preparing to force tens of thousandsof them back to Vietnam.</LP><TEXT>   That appears to be the outcome of British negotiations inHanoi earlier this month. The British have been seekingVietnam's agreement that it would take back many of the boatpeople who continue to arrive at the rate of about 100 a dayin Hong Kong. There, they are slapped into detention centersthat hold more than 64,000 asylum-seekers. There are about195,000 Indochinese refugees in camps scattered aroundSoutheast Asia, mainly in Thailand and the Philippines,according to U.N. figures.   Last week, U.N. officials announced that the Vietnamesegovernment had consented to take back even those refugees whodon't want to return. Very few do. Most risked their lives toescape. Some 10,000 Vietnamese boat people at one Hong Kongdetention center demonstrated peacefully Monday against theprospect of forced repatriation. If Hong Kong's governmenttries to force the Vietnamese onto planes bound for Hanoi --as it did with 51 unwilling boat people in December 1989 --the shameful scene could turn more violent.   It's worth noting that Hong Kong is not the chief villain.The small colony has granted temporary asylum to hundreds ofthousands of boat people over the years -- passing many on toprocessing centers elsewhere, sending some to new homes, andproviding shelter of a shabby and cramped sort for those leftin limbo.   But the main blame goes to the Vietnamese communists, whocontinue to create a climate so wretched that their peoplerisk drowning in the South China Sea even for a long shot atcitizenship elsewhere. The best resolution would be forHanoi's party bosses to go the way of their Soviet BigBrothers. It's worth holding up any kind of developed-worldaid and comfort until Vietnam produces a government thatshares the values of Boris Yeltsin, not Vladimir Lenin --whose statues still stand in Vietnam.   That said, however, it's also worth noting that no freenation has stepped forward with the second-best answer to theVietnamese refugees -- which would be to take them all in.   American authorities have been unenthusiastic about theidea of forcing Vietnamese refugees home. But they have alsobeen niggardly, accepting only some 51,000 Indochinese thepast year, and aiming to accept perhaps 52,000 over the nextyear. Of the tens of thousands of boat people in Hong Kong'scamps, only about 1,000 were admitted in the past year toAmerica, land of liberty. Other nations are worse. Japan, forexample, takes almost nobody.   Southeast Asian authorities who must deal with Indochina'srefugees have cultivated the fine art of distinguishing&quot;economic migrants&quot; from genuine refugees, classified aspeople fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution. Theproblem is that countries where economic migration becomes soimportant that people will die to achieve it tend also to becountries where the entire population suffers a well-foundedfear of persecution. Economic and political freedoms are partof the same package. That's why capitalist governments suchas those of South Korea and Taiwan end up on a democratictrack, while communist China and Vietnam end up shooting orjailing patriots.   If the architects of the New World Order truly want toshape a better, freer world community, one of the beststarting points would be to approach the Indochinese refugeesituation not as a burden, but as an opportunity to encouragefreedom by welcoming those who at great risk come asking forit.</TEXT></DOC>
