RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Tuesday made it easierfor immigration officials to deport aliens who seek reconsiderationof their claims to remain in the United States.   By a vote of 8-0, the justices barred further hearings for aCalifornia physician, Dr. Assibi L. Abudu, who said he might betortured or killed if forced to return to his native Ghana.   Abudu asked the Board of Immigration Appeals for asylum in thiscountry after it denied his initial bid to avoid deportation.   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, saidimmigration officials, having decided an alien should be deported,generally are under no duty to reconsider the case when the aliensays he has new evidence to support a bid for asylum.   Stevens said aliens seeking to reopen their deportation caseshave the difficult task of proving that immigration officialsabused their discretion in refusing reconsideration.   ``There is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to aclose as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving theadversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present theirrespective cases,'' Stevens said.   He continued, ``We have no hesitation in concluding that theBoard of Immigration Appeals did not abuse its discretion when itheld that Abudu had not reasonably explained his failure to applyfor asylum prior to the completion of the initial deportationproceeding.''   Abudu is a native and citizen of Ghana who graduated from theUniversity of Southern California medical school and married a U.S.citizen.   Immigration officials moved to deport him in 1981 after he wasconvicted in California of illegally attempting to obtain the drugdemerol by fraud. He was given a one-year suspended prison sentenceand was placed on probation for three years.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service found him deportable,and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that decision.   He faces deportation to England, according to court papers. ButAbudu said he might be barred by that country and forced to returnto Ghana.   Abudu asked immigration officials to reopen his case in 1985 andgrant him asylum in the United States from the militarydictatorship of Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, who regained power inGhana in a Dec. 31, 1981, military coup.   Abudu said he had new evidence that his life might be in dangerif he was forced to return to Ghana.   The Board of Immigration Appeals refused to reopen Abudu's case,noting that Abudu did not initially seek asylum when he contestedhis deportation.   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 ordered theboard to reconsider granting Abudu asylum.   The Supreme Court agreed with the Reagan administration that theappeals court should have deferred to the immigration board.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who only recently joined the court,did not take part in the decision.   In other developments, the court:   _Declined to decide yet whether the state or the federalgovernment should control a Gulf of Mexico area off Mississippi'ssouthwestern coastline. Rejecting arguments by the state's lawyers,the court ruled 7-0 that more information is needed before such adetermination is made.   _Heard arguments over the constitutionality of Texas' deathpenalty law. A ruling is expected by July.</TEXT></DOC>
