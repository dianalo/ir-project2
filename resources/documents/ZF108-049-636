(products).andO;Ticker:    CPQ.andO;Product:   Compaq Deskpro 386-20e (Microcomputer).andO;Topic:     MicrocomputersEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Compaq Computer Corp.andM;DESKPRO 386/20eandM;The Deskpro 386/20e, like most Compaq computers, is a dependable performerthat does not stint on quality or price.andM;It offers the most spaces for storage devices with external access, allowingusers to install as many as three devices with front-of-the-machine access.andO;The one internal storage space is generally devoted to a hard-disk drive,either of 40M- or 110M-byte capacity.andM;In PC Week performance tests, the Deskpro 386/20e demonstrated uniqueprocessing power, which can be contributed to three features.andM;First, the Deskpro uses the Intel 82385 memory controller for high-speedmemory caching, which improves performance in CPU-intensive tasks.andP;  Second,the system uses a fast 16-bit VGA controller, dramatically improving itsvideo speed (see performance chart).andM;Third, the Deskpro 386/20e can use the Weitek math coprocessor instead of theIntel 80387 to increase floating-point operation speed.andP;  (The Deskprofinished PC Week's floating-point test in 6.53 seconds vs.andP;  IBM's 7.58 andNorthgate's 7.41.)andM;Also enhancing performance are three programs that Compaq includes with its386 computers: CEMM, an extended-memory manager compatible with Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded-Memory Specification 4.0; Cache, a disk-cachingprogram capable of using conventional, extended or expanded memory; andVDisk, which creates electronic disks in extended, expanded or conventionalmemory.andM;The Deskpro 386/20e accommodates four full-length, full-height expansionboards using the 16-bit AT bus.andP;  All slots are usable with no hindrances wheninstalling expansion cards.andP;  An additional 32-bit slot is available to expandsystem memory by another 12M bytes.andP;  Since only 1M byte of memory iscontained on the standard system board, the original 1M-byte memory modulemust be exchanged for a 4M-byte module to expand the unit to 16M bytes.andM;The 140-watt power supply is adequate for supporting the expansion slots andthe possible storage devices.andM;The Deskpro instructions for initial setup are clear, and they includesetting the necessary jumpers and switches.andM;Installation and setup is not difficult.andP;  The Deskpro 386/20e contains twointernal switch banks that specify the configuration.andP;  The factory settingsare generally correct.andP;  If a change is needed, Compaq provides a handy guideto the switch setting inside the system unit.andM;Compaq Computer Corp. can be reached in Houston at (800) 231-0900.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;According to many Deskpro 386/20e buyers, a key advantage of the desktop isits reliability, but Compaq's product support needs improvement.andM;For example, Eldon Morland, manager of information services at Natural GasClearinghouse, a gas marketing and consulting firm in Houston, said that whenpurchasing the Deskpro 386/20e, &quot;price was a consideration, [but] I waswilling to pay the extra premium for better reliability.&quot;andM;VGA on the Deskpro's motherboard is another plus, Morland added.andP;  &quot;It allowsfor more slots and in the long run is less expensive because you don't haveto buy an additional memory board,&quot; he said.andM;Laurent Levy, LAN supervisor at Rochester Telephone in New York, also foundthe Deskpro 386/20e to be reliable.andP;  &quot;I was generally pleased with theconstruction [of the Deskpro 386/20e] and [its] compatibility with standardsoftware,&quot; he said.andM;However, many buyers said Compaq support falls by the wayside.andP;  &quot;You cannever get to Compaq,&quot; said Morland.andP;  &quot;They don't deal with end users.andP;  Youhave to go through a third party, and they call Compaq.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
