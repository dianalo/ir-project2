 Although add-ins for1-2-3 abound, only two--PowerDialer and Mail Server--grant you these covetedpowers.andP;  Unfortunately, in most cases these programs have shortcomings thatoutweigh their advantages, which include working within 1-2-3.andM;If you make lots of phone calls, PowerDialer helps you look up phone numbersstored in your worksheet and dials them for you automatically.andP;  With somework, you can customize the program so that it will automatically include theprefix 1 or 1 plus the area code, then route your calls through thelong-distance carrier you have chosen.andP;  Because your phone list stays in yourworksheet, you can query and sort it with 1-2-3's database commands.andM;But be forewarned.andP;  If you have an external modem--even one as popular as theHayes Smartmodem 2400--PowerDialer ($79) may not work with it.andP;  You may beable to make the program work by adjusting your modem, but you'll have tocall a MicroWay product-support specialist for help because PowerDialer'smanual doesn't cover this problem.andP;  If you still can't make the adjustment,you'll have to buy a special serial cable.andP;  Unless you want to do all yourwork inside 1-2-3, you'll be better served by Hot Line Two ($99, GeneralInformation, Kirkland, Wash.; see the review in the November 1988 issue).andM;Mail Server ($195) is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) communicationsprogram, which means that it can function while you use 1-2-3 or any otherapplication.andP;  This program is designed primarily to exchange data and fileswith other PCs running Mail Server.andP;  It includes many features that you'dexpect to find in a general-purpose communications program, but each of thesefeatures is hampered by significant limitations.andM;For an additional $99, you can purchase a 1-2-3 add-in that works with MailServer.andP;  The add-in has two features: One lets you transfer data from MailServer's communications screen directly into your worksheets.andP;  The other letsyou combine 1-2-3 macros with Mail Server's programming language to createapplications that collect, analyze, and transfer data.andP;  But here too you'relimited in the amount and structure of the data you can collect.andM;POWER DIALINGandM;PowerDialer offers several ways to increase your efficiency.andP;  Once youinstall, set up, and invoke this add-in, you can make calls simply by movingyour cursor to the cell containing the number you want to call and pressingthe Return key.andM;You can set up PowerDialer to dial automatically a 1 or a 1 plus the areacode before each phone number that demands it.andP;  PowerDialer will also dial a9 or another digit before all external calls on A Centrex communicationssystem.andM;But it takes work to obtain these efficiences.andP;  If you want PowerDialer todistinguish between local exchanges that require you to dial 1 and those thatdon't, you have to enter into your worksheet a list of exchanges that don'trequire a 1.andP;  Then you have to define that list through the program's menu.andO;Imagine the time it would take to create such a list for Chicago or New York.andM;If you want the program to choose automatically the least expensivelong-distance service for each call, you have to create a list of area codesfor each long-distance service.andP;  If PowerDialer doesn't find the area codefor a number in one of these lists, it will use your standard long-distancecarrier.andP;  The program lets you choose two discounted services in addition toyour standard carrier.andM;It follows that if you use more than one worksheet to store phone lists,you'll have to combine your list of area codes into each of them.andO;PowerDialer could spare you much of this tedium if it let you enter just oneset of lists--for the area codes you dial most frequently--into the programitself.andM;Storing your phone-list data in a 1-2-3 worksheet poses another problem.andO;Unless you're using a multitasking operating environment such as Desqview($129.95 for Version 2.2; $189.90 for Desqview 386, Quarterdeck OfficeSystems, Santa Monica, Calif.) when you want to dial a number, you have todiscontinue the work you're doing to load 1-2-3.andP;  Phone-dialing programs thatcan dial numbers while you work with other applications, such as Hot Line Twoand SideKick ($84.95; $199.95 for SideKick Plus, Borland International,Scotts Valley, Calif.) avoid that problem.andM;MODEM TROUBLEandM;In our tests PowerDialer worked well with internal modems, but failed to workwith a Hayes Smartmodem 2400 or a US-Robotics Courier external modem.andP;  Wewere able to use these modems only after modifying the wiring of our serialcable.andP;  This is a task that's likely to be beyond your ken and could cost $50to have someone else do.andP;  If you use another type of external modem, you maybe able to correct the problem by adjusting the modem itself.andM;Before you purchase the program, you can perform a simple test to determineif it will work with your external modem without any special modifications.andO;Just turn on your modem and type the following two lines at the DOS prompt:MODE COM1: 1200 ECHO xxxx andgt;COM1:andM;If your modem is hooked up to COM2, substitute COM2 for COM1 in each of thetwo commands.andP;  If you get the error message &quot;Write fault error writind deviceCOM1&quot; after you enter the second line, PowerDialer will not work with yourmodem.andM;It is worth mentioning that the MicroWay support specialist with whom wespoke had never encountered this problem and could offer very little help.andO;If your modem fails to pass the test, you may be on your own when you try tomake it work with PowerDialer.andM;Because PowerDialer is an add-in, you can control it with 1-2-3 macros.andP;  Thatmeans that you can create an application that extracts the phone numbers youmust call today and begins dialing the first number on the list.andP;  However,the program cannot deal with busy signals or incompetence calls, which limitsthe extent to which you can automate dialing with macros.andM;Finally, although you can have PowerDialer automatically load itself when youload 1-2-3, the manual does not explain how to set up the program to do that.andM;MAIL SERVICEandM;If you want a more traditional communications program--one with which you cantransfer files--and you want to be able to control it through 1-2-3 macros,Mail Server may be worth your attention.andP;  The program consists of amemory-resident program, which runs in the background while other programsare running in the foreground, and a 1-2-3 add-in with two features.andO;Unfortunately, the program also has a host of limitations.andM;With its memory-resident portion, you can exchange files, data, andelectronic mail with other PCs.andP;  You can set the program to answer calls andallow another computer to downland files, but it can make these exchangesonly with other computers running Mail Server.andM;You can also use the program to dial remote data sources, such as Dow Jonesor CompuServe.andP;  You can exchange files with the remote souce if it supportsthe Xmodem communications protocol.andP;  CompuServe supports Xmodem; MCI Maildoes not.andP;  You can also capture data from Mail Server's communications screento an ASCII file.andP;  But the program can capture data only one screen at atime.andP;  Unless the remote source pauses after each screenful of data, youwon't be able to capture that data to a file.andM;The program can emulate TTY (teletypewriter) and Dec VT52, VT100, and VT220terminals.andP;  In our tests, however, we could not use any of the latter threeterminals to dial into CompuServe.andP;  A 3X USA Corp. technical-supportrepresentative suggested that we stick to the TTY terminal.andP;  This becomes acostly limitation because TTY is slower than the other terminals, andconsequently more expensive.andM;One feature of the 1-2-3 add-in that makes up part of Mail Server lets youtransfer data from the communications screen into your worksheet withoutrouting it through an ASCII file.andP;  The add-in captures the incoming data intoa small, proprietary worksheet from which you can combine the data into a1-2-3 worksheet.andM;But the mini worksheet is only two columns by 300 rows, which limits theamount and layout of the numerical data you can import at one time.andO;Moreover, each cell accepts no more than 16 characters, so it's almostimpossible to import text along with your data.andP;  In many cases it's easier tocapture the data into an ASCII file and then import it into your worksheet.andM;These limitations of the mini worksheet are especially disappointing in lightof Mail Server's excellent facilities for creating automated applications.andO;The second feature of the 1-2-3 add-in lets you create programs with MailServer and invoke them via 1-2-3 macros.andP;  The programs, called Autoscripts,can dial a remote service such as Dow Jones, capture data, and return you to1-2-3.andP;  A macro can then combine the captured data into an existing worksheetand analyze it there.andM;You create an Autoscript by recording keystrokes.andP;  You can also enhance theAutoscript with functions that wait for a specific response form a remotedata source or pause the program for a specified number of seconds.andP;  Becausethe program can capture data only one screen at a time, these functions arevery important.andP;  The language you use to create the Autoscripts has twodrawbacks.andP;  It has no branching function, so you can't write Autoscripts thatprompt the user according to different responses from the remote system.andP;  Andyou can't edit an Autoscript once you've created it.andM;Mail Server's manual, like PowerDialer's, would be more helpful if itcontained some illustrated examples.andP;  It tells how to set up the program forboth U.S.andP;  and European communications, but we found it easy to confuse thetwo sets of instructions.andM;If you have 640K of memory and DOS 3.3, 1-2-3, and Mail Server loaded, you'llhave about 66K for your worksheet, but no room for an add-in such as SQZ!andO;Plus.andP;  If you detach Mail Server's add-in, you can increase that space toabout 150K.andM;IN BRIEFandM;PowerDialer Version 1.0.andP;  MicroWay Inc., P.O.
