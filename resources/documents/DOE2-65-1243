Both technical and economical aspects wasstudied taking in account our climate and marketing conditions in Finland.Also possibilities for using total-energy-unit in the electrical energysupply of the greenhouse was studied. The calculations was made on thebasis of exemplary nursery, however, for full scale production mode.It was founded, that plant production under pure artificial light conditionsin so called growing rooms is unable to compete with the normal greenhouseproduction. It is possible to decrease total production costs in normalgreenhouse using artificial light to extend the annual growing period.It is advantageous to place multi-layer growing equipments in the greenhouse,because it gives a possibility to increase the capacity of the greenhouseand make the production costs lower. The lowest sum of variable and fixedcosts was obtained in the double-layer, rotating growing equipment inwhole year use. The total-energy-unit prowed to be competitive, however,the pay-back-period of the investment will be about 5-6 years.</TEXT></DOC>
