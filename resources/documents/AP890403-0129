The Fair Trade Commission has received more than 300 inquiriesfrom Tokyo residents alone on the new 3 percent sales taximplemented over the weekend, commission spokesman Eiichiro Kokubosaid.   Most of the callers to the commission's ``cartel emergencyline'' pointed out unwarranted price markups, and expressed fearsof inflation, he said.   The across-the-board tax on commodities and services, known hereas a consumption tax, was the highlight of the reform led by PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita.   With adjustments in a variety of taxes under the reform pricesfluctuated. For example, some imported liquor prices fell, whilemilk prices rose and soft drinks in vending machines stayed thesame. Television sets were cheaper, but newspapers raised theirprices.   The government granted a special exemption for small businesseswith annual sales of less than $232,558, freeing them fromcollecting the 3 percent tax.   But many enterprises which are technically exempt, such asindependent taxis and discount stores, raised prices anyway. Somedid so to offset increased operating costs, others simply forprofit.   The commission's telephone advisory service will continue fortwo years and the the commission will be on guard for perniciouscases, Kokubo said.   Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency has received some 760phone calls since April 1, spokesperson Mitsuko Asada said.   About one-third of the callers complained of unreasonably highprice hikes, she said, while many other callers had a questionsabout the tax system itself.   ``We cannot directly impose administrative guidance on theretailers, but the agency notifies related ministries if we receivea number of similar complaints, or if the price hike exceeds 3percent,'' Ms. Asada said.   Consumer unions throughout the nation also have received about400 phone calls from consumers in the last two days, she added.   Concerns over inflation and excessive price hikes discouragedmany shoppers last weekend, and a sale at the Takashimayadepartment store in Tokyo brought in 10 percent less sales thannormal for weekends, said Takashimaya spokesman Satoshi Ogawa.   ``I guess this is a kind of setback from the sales we made inMarch, when consumers bought so much to stock up,'' he said.   He said it will take more than a month to determine how theconsumer tax will affect the store's sales.   The tax reform and a stock-profiteering scandal involvingTakeshita and many of his party's elite have led to support ratingsas low as 9 percent in recent opinion polls.</TEXT></DOC>
