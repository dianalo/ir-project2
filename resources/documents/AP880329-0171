Professor Sayed El-Sayed of Texas Aandamp;M University said increasedamounts of ultraviolet light, which a thinner ozone shield permitsthrough to the Earth's surface, supresses biological activity inmicroscopic marine plants in the Antarctic.   El-Sayed said his findings, the first of their kind, confirmstrong suspicions of biologists that ultraviolet light might meantrouble for fish, animal and other life in the southernmost part ofthe world.   On the other hand, ``I never underestimate the resilency ofnature,'' he said.   El-Sayed said it is impossible now to say whether the plankton _microscopic single-celled organisms called ``the grass of the sea''_ and the organisms that feed on them might adapt to increasedultraviolet radiation, and much work remains to be done.   Plankton and the tiny shrimp-like creature called krill thatfeed on them are the primary food source for the whole web of lifein the Antarctic, including fish, penguins and whales. A baleenwhale may eat three tons a day.   ``If anything happened to the krill population, the wholeecosystem probably would collapse, and you can say goodbye to thewhales and the penguins and the seals and the fish,'' El-Sayed toldreporters at briefing arranged by the World Resources Institute, aWashington environmental research organization.   Several nations are studying plans to harvest krill, a550-million to 770-million ton reservoir of protein. A 10 percentannual harvest would almost equal the current world fish catch.   The ozone shield over Antarctica already thins greatly inspringtime, with the depletion reaching a record 50 percent lastyear. Scientists attribute the destruction of ozone to man-madechemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a 1 percentdrop in ozone means a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet light and a4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skin cancers.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on March 15said a depletion of ozone at mid-latitudes of the NorthernHemisphere since 1969 was in all likelihood the result of thosechemicals. The Du Pont Co. said last week it plans to stop makingthem.   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told reporters over lunchTuesday that the EPA and NASA would try to speed up the firstscientific review under last fall's treaty by 31 nations callingfor a cut in CFC production by 50 percent by 1998.   Thomas said he would not support bills in the Senate, subject ofa hearing Wednesday, calling for an early 95 percent cut in U.S.production.   A U.S. cut beyond international agreement might take thepressure off other CFC-producing countries to act further, Thomassaid, and would add little to ozone protection.   Sayed, a biological oceanographer, was supported in his worklast fall on Anvers Island near Palmer Station by the NationalScience Foundation. He and the foundation wanted to see if he couldextend earlier German findings that decreases in ultravioletenhance plankton growth.</TEXT></DOC>
