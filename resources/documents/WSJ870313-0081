The legislation emerged from the subcommittee largely in the form proposed at the start of the week by Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). The bill would give the president more discretion in resolving trade disputes than the one first introduced this year.    &quot;On a bipartisan basis, trade legislation is moving,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said after the subcommittee completed its work on the bill. He said the bill would toughen trade policy and open foreign markets &quot;without the frightening word of protectionism.&quot;    The Ways and Means chairman acknowledged, however, that the biggest potential battle was delayed because Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) decided to wait until the bill reaches the full committee before fighting for a controversial provision he sponsors.    Rep. Gephardt's proposal would require the U.S. to impose trade sanctions against countries that have huge trade surpluses with the U.S. Rep. Rostenkowski's bill simply would require the administration to initiate negotiations designed to bring about more balanced trade relations with such countries.    The subcommittee did approve a few significant changes to the bill. It adopted an amendment by Rep. Don Pease (D., Ohio) that would expand benefits for workers displaced by imports and create a voucher system for paying for worker retraining. Also approved was a Pease amendment to create a new Office of Unfair Trade Investigations to coordinate the handling of unfair trade practices by foreign countries.    The strong bipartisan support in the subcommittee for the new bill was surprising in light of the sharp partisan differences over trade legislation last year. &quot;I'm one of the most surprised folks around,&quot; said Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.). Trade subcommittee chairman Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.) said, &quot;We all have to admit that we have a $170 billion trade deficit, and that we've got to cure it. This is the first step.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
