We point out that the structures in multichannelcases can also be treated with an improved form of Buettiker's method,which was originally used for two channel cases. A formula for multichanneltransmission coefficient is presented. As a simple example, the numericalresults for three branches are given, which show the application of theformula and illustrate the transmission probability resonances in suchstructures.</TEXT></DOC>
