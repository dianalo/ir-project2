U.S. District Judge Charles Keenan said at Wednesday's hearingthat he ``wouldn't dream of setting bail'' until Khashoggi's worthis verified.   Once among the world's richest men, Khashoggi was said to be themiddleman in the Iran-Contra deal.   The former fugitive, handcuffed and wearing a green walking suit,did not talk with reporters before leaving Kennedy InternationalAirport with FBI agents. But in a statement released by his lawyer,Khashoggi said he intends to contest the charges and is confidentthat ``my innocence will be clearly established.''   Khashoggi's attorney, Robert Morvillo, had asked that bail be setno higher than the $5 million bond granted Mrs. Marcos.   Khashoggi's assets have dwindled recently as various holdingshave been sold. ``I read in the newspapers, like everyone else, thathe's a very rich man, but I don't know that,'' the judge said.   ``I think your honor can assume that he's an enormously wealthyman,'' Morvillo said.   Instead of jail, Morvillo suggested that Khashoggi be put underhouse arrest at his luxury apartment on Fifth Avenue. He saidKhashoggi could pay for private security guards deputized by thecourt to watch him.   Keenan laughed at the idea but said he would keep in mindMorvillo's arguments in favor of bail.   U.S. Assistant Attorney Charles LaBella opposed bail and housearrest, saying he had learned that creditors were about to forecloseon the apartment.   In October, a federal grand jury in New York indicted Khashoggi,the Marcoses, five other people and the California Overseas Bank inLos Angeles.   The Marcoses were charged with stealing millions from thePhilippines to buy real estate and art in New York. Khashoggiallegedly posed as the owner of some of the assets as a cover.   Khashoggi, 53, had been jailed in Switzerland since his April 18arrest at a luxury hotel in Bern. But Swiss officials deniedextradition for racketeering and conspiracy charges because they'renot recognized under Swiss law. He was arraigned Wednesday on mailfraud and obstruction of justice.   He faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.   Khashoggi, who once traveled the globe in his private yacht andplane, spent the last three months in a 30-square-foot prison cellfighting extradition.   He is said to have been a major financier and middleman of theIran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of secret U.S. arms sales toIran were channeled to rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftistSandinista government. He has acknowledged a role in the deal andsaid he lost $10 million on it.   Khashoggi also has been named in several kickback scandals, andhas had financial problems that led one of his companies to file forprotection under bankruptcy law. His arrest in Switzerland markedthe first time that he was ever jailed.   A U.S. diplomatic note asking that Khashoggi be arrested citedfour buildings in Manhattan and a collection of paintings thatdisappeared from a Manila museum, Swiss authorities said.   Khashoggi's lawyers two weeks ago announced they planned toappeal the extradition. But the Swiss Justice Ministry statementsaid Khashoggi changed his mind at a recent hearing. His lawyersgave no explanation for the change of heart.</TEXT></DOC>
