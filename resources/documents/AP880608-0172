(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Porter-Starke Services Inc. and theValparaiso YMCA wanted to put 160 acres of farmland to good use, sothey came up with the idea of a turkey farm, an idea that appearsto be, well, a turkey.   Only two families have signed up for the program, and at least20 were needed by Wednesday's deadline.   For $18, a family gets a 1-day-old turkey chick. For the nextfive months, each family takes turns feeding all the chicks.   After five months, the 16- to 35-pound turkeys are sent to acommercial processor, where they are dressed and returned to eachfamily in time for Thanksgiving dinner.   ``I talked to some people who said, well, I'm not going to eatsomething I raised,'' said Dick Carlson, executive director of theYMCA. ``It's a shame. I think it's kind of a neat project myself.''   Carlson said he may extend the deadline.</TEXT></DOC>
