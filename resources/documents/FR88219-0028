Statutory AuthorityThe response to the petition and proposed deletion are issued under section313(e)(1) of Title III of the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-499, ``SARA'' or ``the Act''). Title III of SARAis also the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986.B. BackgroundTitle III of SARA is intended to encourage and support emergency planningefforts at the State and local level and to provide the public and localgovenments with information concerning potential chemical hazards presentin their communities.Section 313 of Title III requires owners and operators of certain facilitiesthat manufacture, process, or otherwise use a listed toxic chemical toreport annually their releases of such chemicals to the environment. Onlyfacilities that have manufacturing operations (in Standard Industrial ClassificationCodes 20 through 39) and have 10 or more employees must report. Such reportsare to be sent to both EPA and the State in which the facility is located.The basic purpose of this provision is to make available to the publicinformation about total annual releases of toxic chemicals from industrialfacilities in their community. In particular, EPA is required to developa computer data base containing this toxic chemical release informationand to make it accessible by telecommunications on a cost reimbursablebasis.For reporting purposes, section 313 establishes an initial list of ``toxicchemicals'' that is composed of 329 entries, 20 of which are categoriesof chemicals. This list is a combination of lists of chemicals used bythe States of Maryland and New Jersey for emissions reporting under theirindividual right-to-know laws. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to modifyby rulemaking the list of chemicals covered either as a result of EPA'sself-initiated review or in response to petitions under section 313(e).Section 313(e)(1) provides that any person may petition the Agency to addchemicals to or delete chemicals from the list of ``toxic chemicals.''EPA issues a statement of policy and guidance in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479). This statementprovided guidance to potential petitioners regarding the recommended contentand format for submitting petitions. The Agency must respond to petitionswithin 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanationof why the petition is denied. If EPA fails to respond within 180 days,it is subject to citizen suits. In the event of a petition from a Stategovernor to add a chemical under section 313(e)(2), if EPA fails to actwithin 180 days, EPA must issue a final rule adding the chemical to thelist. Therefore, EPA is under specific constraints to evaluate petitionsand to issue a timely response.State governors may petition the Agency to add chemicals on the basis ofany one of the three toxicity criteria listed in section 313(d) (acutehuman health effects, chronic human health effects, or environmental toxicity).Other persons may petition to add chemicals only on the basis of acuteor chronic human health effects. EPA may delete substances only if theyfail to meet any of the criteria contained in section 313(d).Chemicals are evaluated for inclusion on the list based on the criteriain section 313(d) and using generally accepted scientific principles orthe results of properly conducted laboratory tests, or appropriately designedand conducted epidemiological or other population studies, that are availableto EPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of Petitions</ITAG>The Agency received three separate petitions to delist titanium dioxide,CAS No. 13463-67-7, from the list of toxic chemicals. The three petitions,in order of receipt, were from: E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont),SCM Chemicals, Inc. and Didier Taylor Refractories Corporation, and KemiraOy. EPA received the first petition on August 24, 1987, and under statutorydeadline must respond by February 20, 1988. DuPont and SCM/Didier Taylorsubmitted extensive documentation to support their claim that titaniumdioxide (TiO<T2>2</T2>) fails to meet any of the statutory criteria in section 313(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. EPA's Review of Titanium Dioxide</ITAG>A. ChemistryTitanium dioxide (TiO<T2>2</T2>) is a white powder that exists in three crystalline forms: Rutile,anatase, and brookite. TiO<T2>2</T2> is thermally stable, chemically insert up to 3,000anddegrees;C,and is not soluble in water but does exhibit solubility in hot concentratedsulfuric acid and alkaline hydroxide (Ref. 2).B. Toxicity EvaluationThe health and environmental review included an assessment of chronic toxicity,mutagenicity, oncogenicity, and environmental toxicity. Available dataon the health and environmental effects of TiO<T2>2</T2>, including data submitted by DuPont and SCM/Didier Taylor, EPAdocuments, and studies obtained from literature sources were reviewed.1. <T3>Chronic toxicity. </T3>The available limited epidemiological studieshave provided no evidence of significant respiratory effects in humans.The results of a well-conducted, long-term inhalation study showed thedevelopment of minimal lung fibrosis in male and female rats exposed for2 years to very high concentrations, 50 and 250 mg/m3, of respirable TiO<T2>2</T2> dust. Based on the results of this study, a no observable adverseeffect level (NOAEL) of TiO<T2>2</T2> via inhalation is estimated to be 10 mg/m3. Several injectionstudies showed that TiO<T2>2</T2> did not cause fibrosis of the rat lung or peritoneum followingintratracheal instillation and intraperitoneal injection, respectively.TiO<T2>2</T2> appears to be nontoxic upon ingestion. The results of a NationalCancer Institute feeding carcinogenicity study in rats and mice showedno chronic toxicity associated with ingestion of TiO<T2>2</T2> in the diet at 25,000 or 50,000 ppm. TiO<T2>2</T2> has been shown to have low <T3>in vitro </T3>biological activity as determined by cytotoxicity assaysin cell culture (Ref. 6).2. <T3>Mutagenicity. </T3>Studies have shown that TiO<T2>2</T2> does not induce gene mutations, DNA effects, or cell transformationsin cells in culture (Ref. 6).3. <T3>Oncogenicity. </T3>Based on a review of the available data, the totalweight-of-evidence for the carcinogenicity of titanium dioxide is not sufficientto reasonably anticipate that this chemical will cause cancer in humans.This conclusion is based on a review of a series of well-conducted laboratoryanimal studies performed in multiple species and involving multiple routesof exposure. The epidemiological study, submitted by DuPont, of workersexposed to TiO<T2>2</T2> and/or TiCl<T2>4</T2> was found to be inconclusive. No adequate epidemiological evidenceexists on TiO<T2>2</T2> that will permit an evaluation of the effects on humans exposedto the chemical (Ref. 6).In long-term bioassays, TiO<T2>2</T2> was not carcinogenic at any dose by oral administration to ratsand mice (both sexes) or by inhalation to male and female mice. Intraperitonealinjection in mice, subcutaneous injection in dogs, intratracheal instillationin hamsters, and intramuscluar injection in rats did not result in tumorigenicity.In an inhalation bioassay involving multiple dose levels, carcinogeniceffects were noted in rats at the high dose level, 250 mg/m3, only. Thesingle positive effect appears to have been produced at a dose level thatoverwhelmed normal clearance mechanisms in the lung which leads to a questionablerelevance of this finding. The questionable relevance of the positive resultswhen evaluated against the multiple negative carcinogenicity results, alongwith the negative mutagenicity data, leads to an overall weight-of-evidencedetermination that there is not sufficient evidence for carcinogencity(Ref. 6).4. <T3>Ecotoxicity. </T3>Available data indicate that TiO<T2>2</T2> exhibits very low aquatic toxicity with a 96-hour LC<T2>50</T2> greater than 1,000 mg/L, and TiO<T2>2</T2> does not bioaccumulate to high levels in fish (Ref. 6).C. Use, Release, and Exposure1. <T3>Production. </T3>The Agency has confirmed that there are four producersof TiO<T2>2</T2> in the United States. DuPont has four plants (in Antioch, CA,Edgemoor, DE, DeLisle, MS, and New Johnsonville, TN). SCM has two plants(in Baltimore, MD, and Ashtabula, OH). Kemira has one plant in Savannah,GA, and Kerr-McGee has one plant in Hamilton, MS. EPA's estimate of the1986 U.S. production volume for TiO<T2>2</T2> is slightly greater than 1.8 billion lbs., and the growth innear term demand is predicted to be moderate, averaging about 1.5 percentper year. Annual imports of TiO<T2>2</T2> for 1986 were 424 million lbs., making the total U.S. consumptionslightly greater than 2 billion lbs. for 1986 (Refs. 4 and 5).Paints and coatings are responsible for 50 percent of the total consumptionof TiO<T2>2</T2>, and consumption for these uses is expected to increase by 0.5to 1 percent per year. Paper and paperboard make up 24 percent of the totaldemand, and growth is limited in this area due to new techniques. Plasticsrepresent 15 percent of consumption, and consumption for these uses isexpected to increase 3 percent per year. Miscellaneous uses like printinginks, ceramics, elastomers, floor coverings, coated fabrics, and roofinggranules make up 11 percent of the demand (Ref. 5).2. <T3>Releases. </T3>Releases to air, land, and water are possible from themanufacturing plants, processing plants, and end user applications (Ref.4).a. <T3>Manufacturing plants.</T3> TiO<T2>2</T2> is manufactured via two methods. The first method, by which20 percent of the TiO<T2>2</T2> is produced, is the sulfate method. The second method, by which80 percent of TiO<T2>2</T2> is produced, is the chloride method. Air emissions from theTiO<T2>2</T2> manufacturing processes can result from the chlorinator in thechloride method and from the calcine ovens in the sulfate method. Othersources of air emissions are the grinding operations associated with eachprocess. Since large quantities (96,000 to 630,000 kg/day), are groundeach day, the potential for fugitive air emissions is present. Releasesof TiO<T2>2</T2> to water from both processes can occur from the filtering andwashing steps. The major sources of TiO<T2>2</T2> solid waste from the manufacturing processes is expected tobe the solids that settle out of the wastewater sludge during wastewatertreatment and the unreacted crude materials (Ref. 4).EPA calculated air, water, and land emission estimates for TiO<T2>2</T2> from actual manufacturer data for six plants. Total estimatedemissions to the air, fugitive plus stack, ranged from 1,900 kg/yr to 166,000kg/yr. Releases to water ranged from 400 kg/yr to 752,000 kg/yr, and emissionsto land ranged from 136,000 kg/yr to 8,500,000 kg/yr. Kemira was identifiedas having the plant with the highest estimated emissions to air; DeLisle,MS had the second highest estimated emissions to air; and Antioch, CA hadthe lowest estimated emissions to air (Ref. 4).b. <T3>Processors and end-users.</T3> There are over 8,000 estimated processorand user sites, but quantitative data were not available on processingand use operations. EPA's limited analysis indicates, however, that thereleases of TiO<T2>2</T2> to air, land, and water from the paper, plastics, and paintindustry are quite low compared to the release values for the manufacturingplants. The manufacturing plants handle much greater quantities of TiO<T2>2</T2> (96,000 to 630,000 kg/day) on a per day basis than the processorsor end users (40 kg/day) (Refs. 4 and 5).3. <T3>Exposure. </T3>Annual ambient air level concentrations around manufacturingsites of TiO<T2>2</T2> were estimated. Statistical wind summaries along with a varietyof other input parameters, such as emission rate, particle size and density,and stack height, are used to estimate the annual ground level concentrations.Release information estimated for Kemira, the plant with the highest emissionrates, was used to estimate the annual ambient air level concentrationsat the plant boundaries. The results showed a range of ambient air levelconcentrations from 3.25 mg/m3 to 64.9 mg/m3. The entire range is significantlybelow the 10,000 mg/m3 NOAEL for fibrosis of the lung, and concentrationsat this exposure level are not expected to cause cancer in humans (Refs.6 and 7).D. Summary of Technical ReviewThe concerns raised in review of the health data for TiO<T2>2</T2> were the potential development of lung fibrosis and lung cancer.The worst-case exposure concentration is significantly below the no adverseeffect level (NOAEL) for fibrogenic effects. The Agency has found thatthe weight-of-evidence is not sufficient to support a determination thatTiO<T2>2</T2> can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans. Availabledata do not show that TiO<T2>2</T2> causes or can reasonably be anticipated to cause any significantadverse health or environmental effect.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Titanium Dioxide's Relationship to Other Environmental Lists </ITAG>A. State Environmental ListsTiO<T2>2</T2> emissions are generally not regulated at the State level. SinceTiO<T2>2</T2> is a solid, it is generically covered under ``nuisance dust''or ``particulate matters'' standards which are not chemical-specific.TiO<T2>2</T2> was on the section 313 list because it was listed on the (Stateof) Maryland Toxic Substances Registry. Maryland listed the chemical becauseit was listed in a report titled ``The Relative Carcinogenic Potentialof 50 Chemicals That May Be Air Pollutants'' prepared for the Office ofAir Quality and Planning Standards (OAQPS), U.S. EPA, in 1984 (Ref. 3).The inclusion of titanium dioxide in the group of chemicals consideredin the report appears to have been based on the positive response in therat inhalation study, which was referred to in the toxicity evaluationsection of this proposed rule. The Office of Air Quality and Planning Standardshas concurred with this proposed rule. The State of Maryland was consideringthe inclusion of TiO<T2>2</T2> in a proposed air toxic regulation. The Air Management Administrationof the Maryland Department of the Environment has removed TiO<T2>2</T2> from the list of chemicals subject to its air toxic regulation(which is still in draft form). Maryland has decided that TiO<T2>2</T2> emissions can be controlled under the nuisance dust standard,which covers particle size of solids, as opposed to toxicity (Ref. 1).B. EPA Environmental ListsTiO<T2>2</T2> is not included on any EPA list, including those compiled underthe Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and the Toxic SubstancesControl Act (TSCA).c. Other Federal Lists TiO<T2>2</T2> has an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 15 mg/m3, which is for dust particles(i.e., the standard is not related to the toxicity of the substance). TiO<T2>2</T2> is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for varioususes, including as a food colorant (up to 1 percent of the weight of thefood) (Ref. 8). <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Explanation for Proposed Action To Delete </ITAG>A. General Policy EPA has broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny petitionsfrom the general public under section 313. When granting petitions, theAgency has a clear obligation to show how the granting of the petitionfulfills the statutory criteria the Agency is to use in section 313(d)when modifying the list of toxic chemicals. However, in the Joint ConferenceCommittee Report, the conferees made clear that EPA may conduct risk assessmentsor site-specifc analyses in making listing determinations under section313(d). In cases of petitions to delist substances, EPA believes that suchanalyses are important factors in determining whether removal of a substancefrom the list would serve the public's right to know. These analyses mightshow that while the toxicity of the substance is not of high concern, exposuresto humans and the environment are significant enough to warrant maintainingthe substance on the list. B. Reasons for Proposing Deletion EPA is granting the three petitions, submitted by DuPont, SCM/Didier Taylor,and Kemira by proposing to delete TiO<T2>2</T2> from the list of toxic chemicals subject to release reportingunder section 313 of Title III of the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986. The decision to grant the petitions and to propose rulemaking to modifythe list is based on the toxicity evaluation. The Agency believes thatthere is insufficient evidence to establish that TiO<T2>2</T2> may cause adverse affects to human health or the environment.The Agency's decision in this case was facilitated by the numerous well-conductedanimal studies on TiO<T2>2</T2> itself. In employing a weight-of-evidence approach, the Agencywill consider a host of items including the number of tests, their validity,epidemiology data, exposure data, etc. A weight-of-evidence approach isinherently chemical-specific. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalizethe conclusions of this review to other chemicals. EPA intends to make this proosed rule final and effective on or about June1, 1988. This target date falls 1 month prior to the statutory deadlinefor submitting release reports for the 1987 calendar year. EPA's positionis that, if the rule becomes final prior to July 1, 1988, the regulatedcommunity would not be expected to submit release reports (for purposesof complying with section 313 of Title III of SARA) for 1987 or 1988. Inlight of the low toxicity of TiO<T2>2</T2>, the Agency believes that the large number of reports that wouldbe submitted would not serve the community right-to-know objectives ofTitle III of SARA and would needlessly burden both the agencies responsiblefor receiving section 313 reports as well as the regulated community. TheAgency realizes that some firms, to ensure compliance in the event thatEPA does not finalize the delisting prior to July 1, 1988, will calculate/estimatereleases and fill out the reporting form. Those firms may want to retaintheir forms until the end of the reporting period. Section 313(d)(4) of Title III of SARA pertains to the effective date ofrevisions to the 313 list. One interpretation of this section would indicatethat, in order to relieve facilities of reporting requirements covering1987 releases, the Agency would have had to make the revision prior toDecember 1, 1986. Since this rulemaking on TiO<T2>2</T2> is taking place between January 1, 1988 and June 1988, section313(d)(4) could be interpreted to mean that facilities would have to reporton releases that occurred during 1987 and 1988. However, EPA believes thatsection 313(d)(4) is meant to cover additions to the list, not deletions.The Agency believes that Congress inserted the language in section 313(d)(4)to protect the regulated community from unreasonable reporting requirementsthat could be created by an addition to the list late in the year. Forexample, it would be unreasonable to add a chemical to the section 313list in June of 1987 and expect facilities to report on releases for theentire 1987 calendar year. Congress created a time lag between additionsto the list and the need to report releases on the added chemical to givefacilities time to gather information, calculate releases, and performother tasks attendant to complying with section 313 reporting requirements.The Agency does not believe that Congress intended section 313(d)(4) toapply to deletions, since deletions relieve the regulated community ofcertain reporting requirements. In addition, public agencies are relievedof the burden of processing forms that are of little or no value in thecontext of community right-to-know. The Agency requests comments specific to the intent to relieve the regulatedcommunity of the obligation to submit section 313 release forms for TiO<T2>2</T2> covering the 1987 and 1988 calendar years. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>The record supporting this proposed rule is contained in docket controlnumber OPTS-400010. All documents, including an index of the docket areavailable to the public in the OTS Reading Room from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The OTS Reading Room islocated at EPA Headquarters, Room NE-G004, 401 M Street, SW., Washington,DC 20460.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Request for Public Comment</ITAG>The Agency requests comments on all the analyses conducted for this reviewand on the Agency's proposal to delete TiO<T2>2</T2> from the list of toxic chemicals. EPA also requests that anypertinent data on TiO<T2>2</T2> be submitted to the address at the front of this notice. Allcomments should be submitted on or before March 15, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.

Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore, requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis. EPA has determinedthat this proposed rule is not a ``major-rule'' because it will not havean effect on the economy of $100 million or more.This proposed rule would decrease the impact of the section 313 reportingrequirements on covered facilities and would result in cost-savings toindustry, EPA, and states. Therefore, this is a minor rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291.This proposed rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) under Executive Order 12291.There are four producers of TiO<T2>2</T2>. Estimates of the number of processors/users that might be subjectto reporting requirements range from 8,125 to 8,940 facilities. The estimatedcost savings for industry over a 10-year period range from $48 millionto $57 million, while the savings for EPA are estimated to be $1 million(10-year present values using a 10 percent discount rate) (Ref. 5).B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct asmall business analysis to determine whether a substantial number of smallentities will be significantly affected. Because the proposed rule resultsin cost savings to facilities, the Agency certifies that small entitieswill not be significantly affected by this rule.C.
