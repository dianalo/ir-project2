If that were so, Henry Hampton, producer of &quot;Eyes on the Prize,&quot; the acclaimed TV documentary about the civil rights movement, would be smiling these days. But he isn't. The Boston film maker is trying to raise money for a sequel to his award-winning, six-hour series. And it hasn't been easy.    The show, which first aired last year on public television stations nationwide, has won 23 prizes, been nominated for an Academy Award and was named Program of the Year by U.S. television critics.    Despite the accolades, raising money for a sequel has been difficult, and Mr. Hampton is $1.5 million short of the $4.5 million needed to put it on the air in the fall of 1989, as planned. Although several of the original show's sponsors have again put up money -- more than half of the funding has come from the Ford Foundation and public television groups -- many others have turned down requests, partly because the sequel promises to be much more controversial than the first series.    &quot;'Eyes on the Prize' ain't no 'Cosby Show,'&quot; says Mr. Hampton, explaining why he thinks some sponsors have been reluctant to give money. &quot;It is a look at America through dark-colored glasses.&quot; While Eyes I, as Mr. Hampton calls the original series, concentrated on the early years of the civil rights movement, Eyes II will focus on Malcolm X, the Black Panthers, the bitterness over court-ordered busing, and inner-city riots.    Raytheon Inc., for example, which gave $25,000 to Eyes I, so far has declined to help fund the sequel. &quot;We've decided to wait and see how the project develops from the point of view of finance and content,&quot; says Janet Taylor, director of corporate donations. Was controversy a concern? &quot;Yes, it was brought up during discussion,&quot; she says. But &quot;the program also falls outside our guidelines of giving,&quot; she adds, since the company usually funds science and technology programs.    Soliciting funds for programming on any thorny topic can be frustrating, as Mr. Hampton's experience illustrates. It took nearly a decade to raise the money to make the original series, when the film maker was virtually unknown and often couldn't even get his foot in the door.    &quot;Corporate America doesn't fund controversy,&quot; says Colin Dougherty, general manager of KMTF, a Public Broadcasting Service affiliate station in Fresno, Calif. &quot;I know some companies would just as soon sponsor 'Big Time Wrestling' on public TV than an 'Eyes on the Prize.'&quot;    Even companies that have donated money to Eyes II concede that controversy is a concern. &quot;The fact is, there isn't a lot of risk-taking in the corporate world,&quot; says Janet Axelrod, a Lotus Development Corp. consultant who encouraged the software maker to help sponsor the series. &quot;And having your name roll up on the screen just after a piece on racial tensions is risk.&quot; Lotus gave $200,000 to the first series and $300,000 to the second.    So far, about 200 companies and foundations have been approached for money for Eyes II by Blackside Inc., a small production company owned by the 48-year-old Mr. Hampton. The response: &quot;Nearly zilch,&quot; says Joe Breiteneicher, a real-estate development manager who is helping raise funds for the sequel. Only a handful of organizations and companies have given money for Eyes II, compared with nearly 50 that donated to the original series before it was filmed.    Some potential donors have been blunt in turning down the requests, Mr. Hampton says. He recalls one executive asking: &quot;You're really angry, aren't you? And don't you really want to show how whites have done black folk wrong?&quot; Mr. Hampton adds: &quot;To get money I realize one must go through a few Archie Bunkers.&quot;    Other companies -- noting that their funds are limited but the requests endless -- say they'd rather give to programs or charities that better fit their goals.    &quot;We believe the message of the MacNeil/Lehrer report is one that can benefit the name of our company,&quot; says Judith Kidd, corporate donations director of Bank of Boston Corp., which helps fund the public-TV news program. &quot;In the case of 'Eyes,' we asked: 'Do we feel that the message is strong enough that the show needs to be put on in order for the community to become a better place?' The answer is no. Civil rights would be better served by giving to community projects.&quot;    And, because there are so many requests for funding, some companies approached by Blackside say they simply don't have any more money to give. &quot;I don't know if the 'Eyes' group asked us for funds. If they did I wouldn't have even spent 10 seconds discussing it. We're full up,&quot; says John Madigan, donations coordinator for Chubb Corp., which has contributed to American Playhouse and a 13-part public television program on nuclear power to be aired next January.    Other potential donors cite a policy of simply not giving money until the film is completed. General Electric Co., for example, gave $254,000 to Eyes I only after it reviewed all six hours of the program. &quot;That rule stands for Eyes II,&quot; a GE spokesman says. &quot;It is in keeping with company policy not to buy something until we've seen the product.&quot; Most of those who gave money for Eyes I, however, did so before the documentary was completed.    Mr. Hampton, who got the idea for &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; while on a civil rights march in Alabama in 1965, says the topics covered in Eyes II are more controversial than those in Eyes I -- and thus the sequel may be harder for some companies to support. The first series covered the early years of the civil rights movement, from 1954, when the Supreme Court declared school segregation unconstitutional, to 1965, when Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. Eyes II will cover the more militant protests of the late 1960s and 1970s, as well as Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover's attitude toward the black-power movement, disputes over affirmative-action programs, and the expanding black underclass.    But Mr. Hampton, who previously was a film maker for government projects aimed at minorities, says the sequel is important because it completes the story of the civil rights movement. &quot;Part I only tells you how apartheid was banned in America. Part II is a story of how blacks took their place next to whites in America,&quot; he says, sitting in his sparsely decorated office, which looks out on a row of housing projects in Boston's South End.    Despite the fund-raising problems, filming will begin this spring. Raising the remaining $1.5 million, Mr. Hampton says, is &quot;achievable with a little bit of luck.&quot;    Mr. Hampton's telephone rings. The call is from a university official notifying Mr. Hampton that the school will award him an honorary doctorate this spring for his contribution to civil rights awareness.    &quot;I'm honored,&quot; he says after hanging up, &quot;but I'd rather have a community grant.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
