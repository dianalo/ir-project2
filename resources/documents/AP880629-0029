Paisley, a central figure in thePentagon bribery investigation, zipped through a quick Senateconfirmation seven years ago without many questions about hisbackground and with nothing but praise from a leading Senatemilitary expert.   Paisley was confirmed to a top Navy job after a nine-minutehearing on Nov. 18, 1981, which was attended by only two of the 17members of the Armed Services Committee.   One of those two was the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., longone of the Senate's loudest advocates of a strong military.Jackson, who died in 1983, was frequently called ``the senator fromBoeing'' because of his military stances.   Paisley spent 28 years at Boeing before joining the Navy in1981. After six years in that post, he resigned in April 1987 aboutthe same time as his mentor, Navy Secretary John Lehman.   Paisley opened a private business as a defense consultant andwas hired quickly by some of the nation's top defense contractors.   Now, he is a target of the investigation into allegations thatdefense contractors and consultants, many of them former militarymen, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that couldbe vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. No chargeshave yet been filed in the case.   Soon after President Reagan took office, Paisley was appointedassistant secretary of the Navy for research, engineering andsystems.   There have been allegations the FBI was told during a backgroundcheck for the appointment that Paisley had been involved in makingquestionable payments or gifts while he was at Boeing. Theallegations were made by a former associate of Paisley's at Boeing,by his ex-wife, and by his ex-sister-in-law.   But none of that information is apparent from the brief hearingon Nov. 18, 1981. It ended with approval of Paisley's nomination ona voice vote. The full Senate approved Paisley's nomination fivedays later.   The FBI has refused to release results of the background check,citing privacy restrictions.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Armed ServicesCommittee, has asked the FBI for that record but hasn't yetreceived a reply, Willie Blacklow, a spokesman for Levin saidTuesday. Levin was not on the committee in 1981.   Levin also asked the White House for its file on the Paisleynomination, but the request was rejected for unspecified reasons,Blacklow said.   The Senate was controlled by Republicans in 1981 and former Sen.John Tower, R-Texas, was chairman of the Armed Services Committee.Attempts to contact Tower were unsuccessful Tuesday.   Scott Maxwell, a spokesman for Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the currentArmed Services chairman, said committee staff members were unableto find a letter from Paisley's ex-sister-in-law warning againstPaisley's confirmation.   The hearing transcript from Paisley's confirmation gives no hintof any controversy.   Only two senators were present: Jackson and Roger Jepsen, theIowa Republican who was acting as chairman of the committee.   Jackson, who died five years ago, said Paisley's work at Boeinghad given him ``the experience and great management skills that areessential for research and development work for the Navy.''   Paisley was asked only two questions, both of them relating topotential future Navy problems.   In his brief prepared statement, Paisley said the Navy had toomany programs in research and said he wanted to reduce that numberbecause ``we are stretched too thin to be able to carry out allthese programs both efficiently and effectively with the resourceswe can hope to obtain in the years ahead.''   In fact, the Navy was on the verge of four years of sharp budgetincreases as it moved toward a 600-ship fleet that was part ofPresident Reagan's record peacetime military build-up.   Paisley told the panel that ``we have too many programs in Randamp;D(research and development) that do not get into production. It isvery difficult to select those programs that are going to continueinto production and I think we have to prove that process.   ``Having selected a program, we must move it rapidly into thefleet,'' he continued. ``It takes much too long to put a programinto the fleet; it just takes much too long.''</TEXT></DOC>
