This year, theyare adding a May Fete Mile race to a day of leisurely activities. There's theannual May Fete parade, the oldest children's parade around. There are alsothe Ice Cream Festival (the kids don't need an explanation for this), the MuttShow, where dogs and their owners can flaunt their various tricks.;    Thepiece de resistance on May 4 is the Black andamp; White Ball.;    Anyway, organizersthought: Since University Avenue is going to be closed anyway for the May Feteparade, why not set up a race too?
