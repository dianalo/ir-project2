The six foreign firms who won seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange last year all stand to lose revenue from the cuts. But if the reductions are an attempt to discourage non-member brokerage firms from seeking seats, as some of the exchange's critics argue, they don't appear to be having that effect.    The Tokyo exchange, under international pressure to open up more to non-Japanese firms, is expected to award additional seats to overseas brokers by the end of the year, and more than 20 firms have applied.    &quot;To have a seat means you are a member of the Japanese financial community,&quot; Toshihide Sakamoto, vice president, equity sales and trading, at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., says. &quot;Many foreign securities firms here need a seat.&quot; Salomon, which failed to win a membership last year, is among those seeking one this year.    The reduced commission rates will hit foreign brokerage firms harder than Japanese ones. Six non-Japanese firms are members of the exchange. They are Merrill Lynch Japan Inc., a unit of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York; Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp., a unit of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York; Morgan Stanley International Ltd., a unit of Morgan Stanley Group, New York; Vickers da Costa Ltd., a unit of Citicorp, New York; Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd., a unit of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong; and S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. (Japan), a unit of Mercury International Group PLC, London.    The six rely on institutional investors who trade in large blocks for the bulk of their equities business here.    Major Japanese brokerage firms, however, have extensive retail networks catering to small investors, who will continue to pay higher rates.    Effective Monday, commission rates on equity trades are being cut by an average of 10%. However, on trades valued at less than 10 million yen ($68,292), the cuts will range from 4% to 7%; on larger trades, commissions will be cut by 12% to 20%.    The Tokyo exchange is trying to gradually bring its fixed commission rates more in line with the negotiable rates on the New York and London exchanges. Officials fear that unless the gap is narrowed, trading in Japanese equities will move offshore. Monday's round of rate cuts is Tokyo's third in two years.    The foreign members of the Tokyo exchange say they suffered the most in the previous round of cuts 11 months ago. Their commission revenue has fallen about 25%, compared with 12% for Japan's &quot;Big Four&quot; -- Nomura Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. This time, they estimate the cuts will cost them 15% to 20%, considerably higher than the average 9.8% reduction estimated by Japan's Ministry of Finance.    &quot;We were hoping the cuts would be more equitable this time,&quot; Peter Coneway, a partner at Goldman Sachs (Japan), says.    Japanese officials concede that the cuts will hurt foreign brokers the most. But they insist that wasn't their intention.    Tsuneo Fujita, director general of Japan's Securities Bureau, says the Ministry of Finance isn't trying to discourage participation in the Tokyo exchange by reducing commission fees. But he says he did ask applicants to &quot;take into consideration whether a seat would be sufficiently profitable with a cut in fees.&quot;    Firms who are seeking a seat, however, say lower fees are not the major issue.    &quot;We care very much what the price is, but the decision isn't based on price,&quot; James Walsh, managing director and branch manager at First Boston (Asia) Ltd., says. &quot;Anyone who bases the decision on price is crazy.&quot;    Despite the fact that a seat may be more expensive in dollar terms than ever before, that operating costs in Japan are skyrocketing and that competition is increasing, many foreign brokers still believe a seat on the Tokyo exchange is worth the price. More than anything, perhaps, it's a status symbol that is considered vital to doing business with statusconscious Japanese clients.    In some cases, a seat can almost pay for itself in new opportunities, particularly in underwriting business. Having a seat gave some foreign brokers a chance to join the underwriting syndicate for the next issue of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp., to be offered in early November.    Toyoharu Tsutsui, an executive director at Morgan Stanley International, says Morgan already has found buyers for its allotment of 10,000 NTT shares -- and earned between $4 million and $5 million in underwriting fees in the process. </TEXT></DOC>
