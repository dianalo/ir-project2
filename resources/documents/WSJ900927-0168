Toward the end of the New York session, the greenback washigher against the yen and the Canadian dollar, but loweragainst most continental European currencies.</LP><TEXT>   The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 136.84yen, up from 136.72 yen late Tuesday in New York. The U.S.currency was also changing hands at 1.5650 marks, down from1.5725 marks.   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 137.65yen, up from the 137.40 yen close there Wednesday.   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5660marks, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5675 marks.   Wednesday's thin trading session was described asindecisive and frustrating, as most dealers tried to keeptheir slates clean ahead of accounting for month-end and theclose of the Japanese first half, both on Sunday.   Bank traders grumbled that the market fluttered every timea finance official spoke at World Bank and InternationalMonetary Fund meetings in Washington. And they said dealingswere prey to rumormongers.   The dollar had already lost ground to the yen lateyesterday after an unnamed German monetary official said theyen should appreciate against the mark and Japanese FinanceMinister Ryutaro Hashimoto said the yen should rise againstboth the dollar and the mark.   &quot;You don't have to study economics, just wait for one ofthem to speak,&quot; said Ty Tan, a New York dealer with DeutscheGenossenschaftsbank, of the officials.   Yesterday, the dollar stabilized against the yen but fellagainst the mark when Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlpledged to the IMF that the high costs of German unity won'tlead to &quot;any concession as far as monetary stability isconcerned.&quot;   Mark bonds already yield more than their U.S.counterparts, attracting purchases of the German currency.   Meanwhile, wild stories, all unfounded, began flying rightfrom the start of Tokyo trading. One asserted that Iraq hadbombed a Saudi pipeline, another that the Iraqi occupierswere destroying Kuwait's oil infrastructure.   The London and New York markets matched those rumors withtales claiming that Egypt had invaded Iraq and that Iraq hadstormed U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Baghdad.   Oil markets in Europe and the U.S. whispered that the U.S.had shot down an Iraqi plane. Another story, told oppositeways, said that Iraq had issued an ultimatum to the U.S. toget out of Saudi Arabia or that the U.S. had issued Iraq anultimatum to leave Kuwait.   &quot;The market doesn't have its own idea of where the dollarshould be, so it waits for rumors or makes them up,&quot;commented Ralf Weidenhammer, manager of treasury andforeign-exchange operations at Commerzbank in Tokyo.   The rumors were given some credence yesterday because ofreal fears of war. The United Nations Security Council votedlate Tuesday to impose an air embargo on Iraq. The decisionextends sea and land embargoes, but doesn't authorize UNforces to shoot down planes violating the ban.   Amid the gloom, the market proved unwilling to pick afavorite currency and stick with it. With investors in abearish mood because of the drawn-out standoff in the Gulfand high oil prices, all nations seem to have a cloud overthem.   The Canadian dollar came under late pressure when FinanceMinister Michael Wilson told the Ottawa parliament thatdomestic interest rates could continue their recent declines&quot;if there is a continuation of the easing of inflation andthe easing of economic conditions.&quot; Three-month Canadiangovernment bills currently yield about 12.5%.   The Canadian currency was quoted in late New York tradingat 86.48 U.S. cents, down from 86.88 cents previously.   The dollar ended European dealings mostly higher as thethreat of Persian Gulf hostilities bolstered the greenback.   In Asian trading, the greenback ended mixed. The volatilesession saw wide swings in the yen and sterling. The U.S.currency finished Wednesday in Tokyo at 136.84 yen, up from136.72 yen late Tuesday.   The dollar began lower on Mr. Hashimoto comment aboutexchange rates but then rebounded when it failed to fallbelow 136 yen.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $406.60 an ounce, up $4.20. Estimatedvolume was a heavy six million ounces.   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at$407.25 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
