About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan after a decadeof civil war, and Moslem guerrillas use border camps and towns asbases and supply points. The Soviets have been withdrawing theirsoldiers from Afghanistan, and the last 50,000 are to be out by Feb.15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.   Insurgent leaders met twice in Islamabad last Friday with YuliVorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador toAfghanistan. But they told a news conference Monday there will be nomore talks until the Kremlin gives up its insistence that theCommunist Party be included in the next government.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, chairman of the seven-party guerrillaalliance, said further talks were ``futile and give propagandamaterial'' to the Soviets.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April1978. Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,growing to an estimated 115,000 soldiers before the withdrawal beganMay 15, 1988.   Most arms and support for the guerrillas come from the UnitedStates and Pakistan.   The Pakistani official said the guerrilla alliance had fought theCommunists in Afghanistan ``for all these years and now is notprepared to give them recognition. We will have to review the wholething with the alliance.''   Vorontosov ended a four-day visit to Pakistan on Saturday, duringwhich he also met three times with Foreign Minister Sahabzada YaqubKhan.   ``We have impressed upon Vorontsov the importance of recognizingthe realities of the situation and negotiate with'' the guerrillas,Yaqub Khan said.   In early December, the Soviet envoy began a diplomatic missionseeking consensus on a broad-based government for Afghanistan afterthe Soviet withdrawal.   After meetings in Saudi Arabia and Islamabad, the guerrillasinitially agreed to another round. They reversed the decision Mondayafter Vorontsov said Moscow would find a way to support its clientregime unless a government including the Communists was in place byFeb. 15.   Vorontsov also has met with Afghan guerrillas based in Iran,Afghanistan's neighbor on the west, and former King Zahir Shah, whowas deposed in 1973 and lives in Rome. About 2 million Afghanrefugees are in Iran.   Guerrillas based in Pakistan say they will establish a council ofmore than 400 members to choose a transitional government to replacethe Communist government in Kabul, which they say is sure to fallwhen the Soviets are gone.   The Pakistani official said refugees will not be forced to returnto Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal is completed, but ``wehope there will be conditions for them to go home in peace.''</TEXT></DOC>
