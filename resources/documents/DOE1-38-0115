Why did the UnitedStates actually begin this TNW deployment in 1983. Is the TNW programaccomplishing its goals. The first period reviewed (1948-59) is consideredin terms of the United States' initial deployment of TNWs into Europe,the Soviet force buildup following World War II, and the creation ofNATO in 1949. Section two traces NATO's changing attitudes towards TNWsfrom 1960-1974. The third section (1975-present) discusses the conventionaland nuclear force balance, NATO's growing divisions during this period,and the role of the GLCM/Pershing II deployment within this environmentof change for NATO. An examination of NATO's patterns of response overthe last 38 years reveals that NATO has failed to develop formal organizationalgoals, choosing instead to react to each Soviet provocation on a case-by-casebasis.</TEXT></DOC>
