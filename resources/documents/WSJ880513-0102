Analysts called the UTU's decision a serious setback to rail industry hopes for major changes soon in expensive union work rules.    CSX, a Richmond, Va.-based transportation and natural resources company has been trying for months to reach agreement with its rail unions on a plan to cut its railroad work force by more than 10,000 jobs, or about 25%. The company would provide severance payments totaling about $600 million and give remaining rail employees bonuses tied to gains in productivity. Half the estimated $450 million a year in savings would be shared with the remaining workers in the form of annual bonuses.    &quot;We regret the decision of the UTU general chairmen. It will make the remainder of the gain-sharing program tenuous at best,&quot; said John Sweeney, CSX Transportation's senior vice president-corporate services. Mr. Sweeney said CSX Transportation will &quot;seek to implement an alternative plan that will accomplish that goal even though it will take longer.&quot;    In recent months, CSX's efforts to reach a breakthrough agreement with labor have met some scepticism on Wall Street. &quot;It seemed like an awfully big bite to chew,&quot; said Jeffrey Stone, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. &quot;Now it's back to the drawing board, and CSX will have to look at a more realistic strategy of incremental rather than monumental changes.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, CSX closed at $26.125, down 62.5 cents.    UTU officials couldn't be reached for comment. But rail union officials involved in the negotiations said the UTU was being asked to give up 50% of its members' jobs at CSX without a proportionate share of the gains. &quot;The UTU felt it was giving up more than any other union while being asked to share some of the savings with employees represented by other unions,&quot; said Richard Kilroy, chairman of the Railway Labor Executives Association, which represents the UTU and 17 other railroad unions. </TEXT></DOC>
