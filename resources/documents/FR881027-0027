These rules will implement Annex V of the International Conventionfor the Prevention of Pollution by Ships, 1973 entitled ``Regulations forthe Prevention of Pollution by Garbage by Ships.'' These regulations wouldapply to marine craft of any size or type, including commercially operatedships and fishing vessels, uninspected vessels, recreational boats, oilrigs and platforms. These proposed rules also specify that ports and terminals,including recreational boating facilities, commercial fishing facilities,and mineral and oil industry ``shorebases'', must ensure the availabilityof facilities to receive ship-generated garbage. The Coast Guard expectsthat these rules will reduce the incidence of discharges of plastics, includingsynthetic fishing nets, and other ship-generated garbage into the maringenvironment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates: </T2>1.

Background</ITAG>The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901-1911), as amendedby Title II of Pub. L. 100-220, (101 Stat. 1458), hereafter referred toas the Act, requires the Secretary of the Department in which the CoastGuard is operating to administer and enforce Annex V of the Protocol of1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollutionby Ships, 1973 (MARPOL 73/78). Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 is entitled ``Regulationsfor the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage by Ships'' and was designedto reduce the introduction of ship-generated garbage into the marine environment.These proposed regulations will apply to all marine craft (inspected oruninspected) on the navigable waters and within the 200 mile ExclusiveEconomic Zone, regardless of flag, and to U.S. ships wherever they arelocated. Annex V prohibits ships from discharging plastics, limits othertypes of garbage discharges and requires that adequate reception facilitiesbe provided at ports and terminals to receive ship-generated garbage. Aparticular focus of Annex V is to prevent the discharge of plastics, includingsynthetic fishing nets, and other persistent debris into the marine environment.The Coast Guard published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)for this rulemaking in the June 24, 1988 issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 23884). The complete text of Annex V ofMARPOL 73/78 was printed as Appendix A of the ANPRM. In the ANPRM, theCoast Guard summarized the environmental, economic and safety concernsrequiring a regulatory solution and explained its general approach to addressingAnnex V in its regulations. The Coast Guard also solicited input from thepublic as to how best to implement the recent amendments to the Act inits regulations. Comments received prior to the preparation of these proposedrules are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Approach</ITAG>The regulations proposed in this Notice modify or add to existing regulationsin 33 CFR Parts 151, 155, and 158, and 46 CFR Part 25. Existing pollutionprevention regulations implement Annexes I and II of MARPOL 73/78 as follows:Part 151 addresses shipboard requirements to prevent pollution and Part158 discusses the reception facility requirements. This Notice proposesto add new subparts and to revise the general sections of Parts 151 and158 to implement the requirements of Annex V as directed by Pub. L. 100-220.There are no new requirements imposed in these regulations which changeAnnex I or Annex II implementing requirements, although a few editorialor typographical errors found in those regulations have been corrected.Minor revisions to 33 CFR Part 158 are proposed which change referencesin 33 CFR Part 151 which were redesignated. In 46 CFR Part 25, the proposedrule would require uninspected vessels, including privately owned recreationalboats, to retain garbage generated on board when it cannot be dischargedin accordance with these regulations. This requirement was proposed forTitle 46 because most uninspected vessel operators are likely to be familiarwith this Title. Moreover, adding this change to Title 46 will create awarenessamong the boating public of their responsibilities under the Act, becausethese rules would then be included in the educational efforts of the U.S.Coast Guard Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadron and other boating educationalorganizations on operators of recreational craft. Because many commentersquestioned the relationship of recent amendments to the Act to other existingfederal legislation, an effort has been made in this preamble to addresstheir similarities and dissimilarities. Some of these laws are the RefuseAct (33 U.S.C. 407), the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA)(42 U.S.C. 6901-6987), and the Marine Protection, Research and SanctuariesAct of 1972 (MPRSA) (33 U.S.C. 1401 <T3>et seq.</T3>).In drafting these proposed rules, the Coast Guard considered the commentsreceived and discussions held with numerous industry representatives, environmentalorganizations and federal agencies. Section 1905(a) of the Act also requiresthe Coast Guard to consult with appropriate federal agencies in establishingregulations which set the criteria for determining the adequacy of receptionfacilities. Accordingly, the Coast Guard has consulted with many federalagencies, including the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Marine Fisheries Service(NMFS) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Minerals Management Service(MMS) of the Department of the Interior.The Coast Guard recognizes that implementation of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78calls for a major change in the way in which ships and ports or terminalsmanage ship-generated garbage. Moreover, the Coast Guard is cognizant thatmuch of the litter found on shores and beaches is derived from shore basedsources and that Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 was not designed to address thesepollution sources. In fact, Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 addresses only a portionof a much larger dilemma of solid waste management throughout the world.Effective implementation of Annex V over the next decade will require significantefforts in shipboard engineering, educational efforts targeted at commercialfishermen, merchant seamen and recreational boaters, and an effective enforcementprogram. The Coast Guard's proposed regulations lay the foundation forthese efforts.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Public Comments Received by the Coast Guard</ITAG>The Coast Guard received a total of thirty-nine letters encompassing some147 individual comments and suggestions as to how the Coast Guard shoulddraft its regulations. These comments are discussed below and are arrangedby topic.1. Requests for Extension of Comment Period and Implementation of AnnexVThe Coast Guard received four requests for an extension of the ANPRM commentperiod but was unable to grant these because of the short period of timebefore the Annex enters into force internationally. To ensure that theANPRM was widely distributed, the Coast Guard directly mailed approximately3,700 copies of the ANPRM to interested persons and organizations. Onecomment was received requesting that the Coast Guard delay implementationof Annex V. The Coast Guard is unable to do this since by the terms ofMARPOL 73/78 and the domestic law implementing it, the Annex will be ineffect on December 31, 1988.2. Requests for Public HearingThe Coast Guard received six requests to hold a public hearing. One commenterspecifically requested a hearing to be held in Texas, because of the severedebris problems which exist in the Gulf of Mexico. The Coast Guard willhold hearings as announced above.3. ApplicabilityThe Coast Guard received three comments concerning the waters and vesselsto which these regulations would apply. One commenter stated that the CoastGuard's regulations should apply to privately owned ships on contract tothe government. The Act provides that ships owned or operated by the U.S.government which are in noncommercial service need not comply with regulationsestablished by the Coast Guard and this is reflected in the proposed rulesin 33 CFR 151.51. This exclusion does not apply to privately owned shipsoperated by owners under contract to the U.S. government. However, a privatelyowned ship that is bareboat chartered to the U.S. government is consideredto be ``operated by'' the government and, if in noncommercial service,is therefore temporarily excluded. Within five years after the effectivedate of Annex V, government owned vessels must comply with regulationsestablished by their own agencies to implement the requirements of AnnexV.One commenter from the Great Lakes commented that there is little to begained by including the Great Lakes within waters subject to these rulessince the Refuse Act already applies there. By section 2(b) of the Act,as amended (33 U.S.C. 1901(b)), Congress specifically applied the requirementsof Annex V to the navigable waters of the United States, which includethe Great Lakes. Therefore, the Coast Guard's proposed rules would applyto the Great Lakes.4. DefinitionsThe Coast Guard received seventeen comments concerning the definitionsof the words ``garbage'', ``plastic'', ``reception facility'', ``disposal'',``port'' and ``Great Lakes''.New definitions to the pollution prevention regulations are proposed in33 CFR 151.05 and 33 CFR 158.120. It was not considered necessary to defineGreat Lakes in this proposal since this term is generally understood anda precise definition is not critical. It is important to the understandingof these proposed rules that there is a clear <ITAG tagnum="54">distinction made between the terms ``terminal'', ``port'', and ``receptionfacility'' as defined in existing regulations and in this proposed rule.As defined in the Act, ``terminal'' refers to a single waterfront facilityor terminal handling ``harmful substances.'' The term ``port'', however,is not so limited. A ``port'' can be a port authority, a group of terminalswhich decide to be grouped together as a cooperative unit, or a lighteragearea, anchorage area, or any other area, designated by the Coast GuardCaptain of the Port (COTP) for purposes of these regulations. Therefore,the Coast Guard has proposed amending the definition of ``port'', for AnnexV purposes, to include specific types of facilities which cater to recreationalboaters, commercial fishermen or mineral and oil industry operations. UnderAnnexes I and II, some terminals have formed ``ports'' or cooperativesto share expenses in cases where there was not sufficient demand for asingle terminal to support its own reception facility. The Coast Guardexpects similar arrangements to be made with respect to the provision ofgarbage reception facilities, especially to meet APHIS requirements.</ITAG>A ``reception facility'' refers only to the means made available at a portor terminal for the disposal of specified garbage. A reception facilitydoes not have to be a fixed part of a port or terminal; it may be a mobileservice such as a tank truck, barge, ``dumpster'' or other commercial ormunicipal garbage disposal operation.5. Discharge Limitations of MARPOL 73/78Five commenters addressed what specific types of garbage may, or may not,be discharged as allowed by Regulations 3-6 of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78.Figure 1 graphically displays these limitations. One commenter suggestedthat the Coast Guard should require dunnage, lining and packing materialswhich will float, to be offloaded from ships to shoreside reception facilitesprior to their departure from ports and terminals. This commenter suggestedthat if they were not offloaded prior to departure, the later dischargeof these items might conflict with the ocean dumping prohibitions of theMPRSA. The present rulemaking does not deal with the MPRSA, and the CoastGuard does not have the authority under the Act to require the offloadingof dunnage, etc. The MPRSA prohibits the transportation of materials fromthe United States for the specific purpose of dumping them into ocean waters,unless authorized by permit from the EPA. House Committee Report 100-360(the report of the House of Representatives on H.R. 940, which became TitleII of Pub. L. 100-220), discusses the relationship of the MPRSA and theAct to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), as amended. The Report statesthat MPRSA ``also prohibits the transport of any material from the UnitedStates for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters.'' If dunnage orother materials are transported for the exclusive purpose of dumping themat sea, the prohibitions of the MPRSA would apply.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Figure </T4>1._<T4>MARPOL</T4> 73/78 <T4>Annex V </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Summary of garbage discharge restrictions]</ITAG><H1>Garbage type </H1><H1>All vessels except offshore platforms and associated vessels </H1><H2>Outside special areas (33 CFR 151.69) </H2><H2>In special areas \1\ (33 CFR 151.71) </H2><H1>Offshore platforms and associated vessels \2\ (33 CFR 151.73)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Plastics_includes synthetic ropes and fishing nets and plastic bags<D>Disposals prohibited </D><D>Disposals prohibited </D><D>Disposals prohibited. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Floating dunnage, lining and packing materials <D>Disposal prohibited less than 25 miles from nearest land </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Paper, rags, glass, metal bottles, crockery and similar refuse  <D>Disposal prohibited less than 12 miles from nearest land </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Paper rags, glass, etc. comminuted or ground \3\ <D>Disposal prohibited less than 3 miles from nearest land </D><D>......do </D><D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Food waste not comminuted or ground <D>Disposal prohibited less than 12 miles from nearest land </D><D>Disposal prohibited less than 12 miles from nearest land </D><D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Food waste comminuted or ground \3\ <D>Disposal prohibited less than 3 miles from nearest land </D><D>......do </D><D>Disposal prohibited less than 12 miles from nearest land. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mixed refuse types <D/>(\4\) <D/>(\4\) <D/>(\4\) <F> \1\ Special areas for Annex V are the Mediterranean, Baltic, Red andBlack Seas, and Persian Gulf areas.

One comment favored and one opposed this. Congressclearly intended that incineration at sea of ship-generated garbage beone option available to ship operators. In House Report 100-360 it expresslyencouraged the U.S. Navy to consider this option for its 600-ship fleetin order to achieve compliance with Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Moreover,the International Maritime Organization (IMO) document, ``Draft Guidelinesfor the Implementation of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78'' (Working Paper 10 ofthe 25th Session of MEPC, hereafter referred to as MEPC 25/WP.10), specificallynotes that ``ash and clinkers'' from incineration of ship-generated garbageare considered ``garbage'' within the meaning of Annex V since they are``operational wastes'' and may, therefore, be discharged at sea outsideof 12 nautical miles in accordance with Regulation 3(1)(b)(ii) of AnnexV. Those ashes and clinkers which can pass through a 25 millimeter (1 inch)screen may be discharged beyond 3 nautical miles from land, provided that``clinkers'' of plastic, if not fully reduced to ash, are still considereda plastic and subject to the no discharge requirements of Annex V. TheCoast Guard's proposed rule would, then, prohibit the discharge of incineratorash at sea within 3 nautical miles from nearest land, but not beyond. TheEPA has advised the Coast Guard that it might consider incinerator ashbrought ashore to be subject to the manifesting and testing requirementsof RCRA. The Coast Guard is concerned that proper disposal of incineratorash has not been fully studied and has submitted a request to the MarineEnvironment Protection Committee (MEPC) of IMO to place this issue on theagenda at its next session in March 1989 and that it become a part of itsfuture work program. The Coast Guard also received four comments concerning garbage dischargelimitations specifically on board fixed and floating platforms. Three commentersrecommended that food wastes and incinerator ash be allowed under the CoastGuard rules to be discharged by oil rigs, platforms and vessels alongsidethem. Another commenter stated that all discharges by these ships, exceptfood wastes outside 12 nautical miles, should be prohibited. Two commenterssaid that the EPA's National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)regulations authorized under the Clean Water Act presently allow oil rigsand other point sources to dischrage non-floating wastes and that AnnexV duplicates these requirements. The Coast Guard takes the position thatafter December 31, 1988, an oil rig or platform operator could be in compliancewith a valid NPDES permit and not be in compliance with Annex V of MARPOL73/78 because these proposed rules go beyond the requirements of the NPDESpermitting system. The EPA's NPDES permits issued to oil rigs and platformsprohibit the discharge of floating solid wastes and garbage, but allowsinkable wastes to be discharged unless they are specifically prohibited.Under Annex V, a higher standard is required for oil rigs and platforms,since no discharge of garbage (except food wastes beyond 12 nautical miles)is allowed. Because of this disparity between the NPDES process and AnnexV requirements, the EPA has indicated that it is considering in futureNPDES permits to require oil rigs and platforms to comply with Annex V.Based on consultations between the Coast Guard and EPA, the proposed CoastGuard regulations do not provide for exempting oil rigs and platforms fromAnnex V requirements because they have an NPDES permit.Under the Coast Guard's proposed rules, uncomminuted food or victual wastesmust be discharged beyond 12 nautical miles, whether the ``ship'' is anoil rig or platform or not. In accordance with IMO's Draft Guidelines,the Coast Guard does not consider ``graywater'' or ``dishwater'' to fallwithin the meaning of ``garbage'' under Annex V. Proposed definitions forthese two terms are shown in the proposed 33 CFR 151.05 definitions.6. Equipment Requirements for ShipsFour comments were received concerning mandatory equipment installationson board ships in order to comply with Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Three commentersrecommended that the Coast Guard mandate the installation of compactors,incinerators or comminuters on ships and another was opposed to mandatoryrequirements for equipment of any kind. The Coast Guard has examined theAct and determined that broad mandates for equipment installation are notauthorized. Moreover, they would deny ship owners and operators the flexibilityto tailor equipment needs to each ship based upon the particular circumstancesof the ship, such as crew size, route, voyage length, etc. Some ships maynot need any equipment on board at all, provided the crew properly managestheir garbage by any of several means which may include product substitutionsto avoid plastics in food stores and supplies, separation of plastics,legally discharging garbage at sea, and storage of garbage for final disposalashore. Accordingly, the Coast Guard's proposed regulations allow, butdo not mandate, the use of particular types of equipment such as incinerators,compactors, or grinders. This is discussed in further detail in the sectionby section analysis of the rules in Part IV below.Six comments were received recommending that the Coast Guard establishenvironmental and safety standards for shipboard incinerators. At present,the only Coast Guard regulations applicable to incinerators used on boardship for disposal of ship-generated garbage are found in Marine Engineeringand Electrical regulations found in 46 CFR Parts 50 through 64 and Parts110 through 113, respectively. These regulations presently apply to U.S.ships only and do not address either airborne emissions or the ash andclinker residues they generate. In addition, through regulations stemmingfrom the Clean Air Act, the EPA or states may regulate the airborne emissionsfrom shipboard incinerators. The Coast Guard has recently discussed thepossibility of drafting comprehensive incinerator design and performancestandards with various organizations, including the American Society forTesting and Materials (ASTM) and the Society of Naval Architects and MarineEngineers (SNAME). The Coast Guard is hopeful that these initiatives, withthe cooperation of the EPA, may lead to an acceptable industry standardwhich could then be adopted within Coast Guard regulations in a subsequentrulemaking. Persons interested in discussing such an initiative shouldcontact the Coast Guard's Marine Technical and Hazardous Materials Division,Commandant (G-MTH), as indicated in the second paragraph in <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>above.7. Operational RequirementsThree commenters proposed that garbage be separated into component types(plastics, dunnage, food wastes, etc.) in order to manage shipboard wastes.The Coast Guard believes these proposed rules allow flexibility for separationand encourage ship operators to consider the separation at the source ofgeneration. The U.S. Navy, in a series of several major at sea tests onboard their warships, has found that one very effective way of managinggarbage is to separate plastics in each space where they are generatedby placing separate containers for plastics and non-plastics. This methodeliminates the need for later separation of plastics from large massesof aggregated garbage and places responsibility for garbage managementon individual generators. However, because ships can legally dischargemost types of garbage, except plastics, subject to the limitations discussedherein, the Coast Guard's proposed rules do not mandate separation, butrecognize this as one way of achieving compliance with these proposed rules.Three commenters questioned whether commercial fishermen were requiredto recover derelict fishing gear or garbage which becomes entrained infishing nets during normal fishing operations. House Report 100-360 makesit clear that Congress did not intend for refuse or other flotsam foundin nets to be considered garbage for the purposes of Annex V of MARPOL73/78. This type of flotsam, if found, may legally be returned to the seawithout being in violation of Annex V. Annex V prohibits the intentionaldischarge of fishing nets at sea. The Coast Guard recognizes that mostfishing nets are lost accidentally during fishing operations and, due totheir high cost, are rarely abandoned. The Coast Guard and NMFS encouragecommercial fishermen to retrieve both fishing gear and other refuse foundwhile fishing, especially since these types of debris can deplete existingstocks of marine seafood.8. Recordkeeping Requirements, Waste Management Plans and Information Placards.The Coast Guard received a total of seventeen comments favoring these requirementsfor certain ships and three opposing them. One commenter suggested thatthe Coast Guard's rules should require fishermen to record and report lossor recovery of fishing gear, establish a gear identification system andrequire degradable panels or sections on traps and nets. As indicated inthe ANPRM, the Act requires the Secretary by December 31, 1989, to designatethose U.S. ships which must maintain refuse record books or keep log entries,maintain a shipboard waste management plan, or display placards to notifycrew and passengers of the requirements of Annex V. Congress allowed thisadditional time for the Coast Guard to pursue negotiations at the IMO sothat an international standard or agreement could be reached. The CoastGuard does not favor establishing requirements solely for U.S. flag vesselswithout having first exhausted the possibility of consistent and mandatoryinternational requirements for all ships subject to MARPOL 73/78. The CoastGuard intends to propose international requirements at the 27th Sessionof the MEPC. While recording of lost fishing gear could fall within the scope of theAct, the Coast Guard believes that the suggestions concerning gear identificationsystems and biodegradable traps and nets are clearly beyond the scope ofthe Coast Guard's authority, especially since NOAA was tasked to studyimplementation of such a system in Title IV of Pub. L. 100-220, the ``DriftnetImpact, Monitoring, Assessment and Control Act of 1987.'' The Coast Guarddoes not intend to specify requirements for these provisions in this rulemaking,but will propose an amendment to these regulations in early 1989. To facilitatethis, the Coast Guard has reserved andSection;andSection; 151.55, 151.57 and151.59 of Part 151 for these three items. The twenty comments receivedin response to the ANPRM will be retained for consideration in developingthis future proposal. 9. Special AreasSix commenters noted support for designation of the Gulf of Mexico as aspecial area under Annex V. One commenter opposed this designation as beingtoo costly. This designation would make the Gulf a no discharge zone, exceptthat ground or comminuted food wastes could be discharged outside 12 nauticalmiles from the nearest land. As noted in the ANPRM, this proposed rulemakingwill not address designation of the Gulf as a special area because an amendmentto MARPOL 73/78 would be required and this could not be accomplished untilafter the entry into force date of Annex V. In anticipation of this, theCoast Guard has prepared a study entitled ``Economic Analysis of Designationof the Gulf of Mexico as a `Special Area' under Annex V of the MARPOL Protocol.''The Coast Guard will consider the seven comments received on this topicin developing its position on whether the Gulf of Mexico should be designatedas a special area under Annex V. Persons interested in either obtaininga draft copy of the Coast Guard's economic analysis, or in commenting onit should write Commandant (G-MER-3) at the address shown in the thirdparagraph of <T2>Addresses</T2> above. 10. Reception FacilitiesTwenty-five comments were received concerning the criteria the Coast Guardproposed in its ANPRM for adequacy of reception facilities: Capacity, accessibilityand ability to receive APHIS regulated food wastes. In the proposed rule,ports or terminals must be able to receive all garbage generated by ships,subject to certain important exceptions. In the ANPRM, the Coast Guardprovided a worksheet to assist port and terminal operators in estimatingthe amount of ship-generated garbage they may receive once Annex V entersinto force. The worksheet was derived from formulae found in a 1978 IMOdocument entitled ``Guidelines on the Provision of Adequate Reception Facilitiesin Ports.'' Several commenters complained that the worksheet or formulaeprovided in the ANPRM were awkward or unrealistic, two recommended defining``domestic wastes'' on the worksheet and one suggested revising the formulaeto include capacity of garbage generated from fixed or floating platforms.This worksheet, with minor revisions, appears at the end of the preambleof this document as Appendix A. The Coast Guard is no longer considering requiring ports and terminalsto provide reception facility capacity based upon these formulae. Nevertheless,for the reasons stated below, the Coast Guard feels these formulae mayprovide a reasonable guide for a terminal operator to estimate the capacityit may receive after December 31, 1988. As far as is known, there are onlytwo major ports in the United States which have conducted an extensiveexamination of their ship-generated waste stream. One of these found thatthe formulae estimated a projected garbage capacity demand some 200-300%above its current demand. Depending on the location of the port, typesof ships served and other factors, this may not be inaccurate. A secondport is utilizing the worksheet formulae in conjunction with other publiclyavailable data to determine its reception facility needs. It is importantto realize that these formulae are premised upon several facts. First,the formulae were designed using data from oceangoing ships only, and thereforemay not be suitable for estimating garbage reception needs for marinas,mineral and oil ``shorebases'', or ports or terminals serving predominantlyrecreational boaters or commercial fishermen. Secondly, the final ``garbagecapacity demand'' generated by using the formulae presume that ships dischargeall authorized garbage into the sea as allowed by Annex V. Finally, theformulae do not take into account the fact that ships may install incineratorswhich might reduce the expected amounts. Despite these shortcomings, theCoast Guard feels these formulae will be useful in assisting port and terminaloperators to gauge an upper limit for their garbage reception needs. The Coast Guard received eight comments concerning ``accessibility'' asa criterion for determining the adequacy of a garbage reception facility.Three commenters noted that reception facilities should be located so thatthey do not impede cargo handling or terminal operations. The Coast Guardconcurs with this and has addressed this aspect in the proposed 33 CFR158.410(a)(2). One commenter was opposed to ``accessibility'' as a criterionfor adequacy whatsoever. Four more indicated that port and terminal operatorsshould be able to contract for reception facility services to commercialwaste haulers <ITAG tagnum="54">in order to allow for flexibility of operations at a port or terminal.Two other commenters suggested that port and terminal operators shouldbe able to have facilities available within a specified period of time.One commenter was opposed to requiring the installation of any equipmentat ports or terminals whatsoever. The Act states that port or terminaloperators must either provide, or ensure the availability of garbage receptionfacilities. The Coast Guard takes this to mean that contractual arrangementsfor Annex V reception facilities are perfectly acceptable in complyingwith these regulations, especially for APHIS regulated food wastes. Becausemost ports and terminals currently provide reception facilities for generalgarbage only, the real concern is the potential for ship delays due tothe unavailability of APHIS facilities. The Coast Guard proposes that APHISreception facilities must be made available within 24 hours after noticeof need is given by an oceangoing ship.</ITAG>Two commenters objected to the Coast Guard statement in the ANPRM thatthere should be no obligation on the part of any port or terminal to providereception facilities for ships not having commercial transactions at thatport or terminal. They stated that any port or terminal must make availabletheir reception facilities to all ships. The Coast Guard does not believethis would be appropriate or effective to impose such a requirement. Portor terminal operators could provide reception facilities to any ship requestingthem but would only be obligated to do this in the proposed 33 CFR 158.420for ships having commercial transactions at a given port or terminal. Threecommenters raised the issue that some states do not allow ship-generatedgarbage originating from outside the state to be brought ashore, apparentlyin contravention of the new requirements of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Thisissue is not addressed in this proposal and is currently undergoing legalreview.One commenter requested that the Coast Guard clarify who is responsibleat a port or terminal for transportation and disposal of garbage. The CoastGuard does not feel it appropriate to mandate which parties at a port shouldconvey garbage from ship to a reception facility, since in many cases collectivebargaining agreements govern. As noted earlier, the Act mandates that personsin charge of ports and terminals ``provide, or ensure the availabilityof'' adequate reception facilities. This proposed rulemaking does not addressdisposal of garbage after it has reached a reception facility, since thisis generally regulated under the authority of other federal, state andlocal laws. The proposed rule provides at 33 CFR 158.410(a)(3), that eachfacility must hold each federal, state and local permit or license requiredby environmental and public health laws and regulations and as a consequencewould have to comply with these regulations concerning garbage handlingand disposal.11. Certificates of Adequacy (COAs)The Coast Guard received numerous comments addressing whether, and how,the Coast Guard should issue COAs. It is proposed to define COAs in 33CFR 158.120 as a document issued by the Coast Guard which certifies thata port or terminal meets the requirements of 33 CFR Part 158 with respectto reception facilities. A COA must have the application form which wassubmitted to the Coast Guard attached to it. The Coast Guard is seekingthe approval of the Office of Management and Budget to amend an existingInformation Collection item (OMB Approval andplusmin;2115-0543) to includea new application form for COAs on Coast Guard ``Form C.'' Although allports and terminals are required to meet the requirements of these regulationsfor reception facilities, only a small fraction of them will be requiredto apply for a COA on Form C.Six comments were received in favor of the Coast Guard issuing COAs andtwo opposed. Two of those in favor of issuing COAs suggested the CoastGuard issue COAs to large marinas of 100 or more boat slips. The CoastGuard believes that most ports and terminals should not be required tohold COAs because the intent of the COA is primarily to ensure that largeoceangoing ships have reception facilities for their ship-generated garbage.The proposed rules would require that Annex V COAs be issued to ports andterminals which receive oceangoing ships subject to Annex I or II of MARPOL73/78 and to those which receive more than 25 port arrivals annually byships whose last port of call was outside the continental United Statesor Canada. The Coast Guard believes that many new approved APHIS facilitieswill be necessary at many ports and terminals which have previously hadlittle demand. After December 31, 1988, ships will not be able to dischargeplastics at sea and if those plastics have come into contact with foreignfood wastes regulated by APHIS, those plastics must be deposited ashoreand treated in accordance with APHIS regulations. Ships may elect to dischargethese plastics ashore at a subsequent port or terminal with approved APHISfacilities.However, the Coast Guard is still considering issuing COAs to some largecommercial fishing facilities (see definition in 33 CFR 158.120) and iscurrently discussing this with NOAA and NMFS. Issuing COAs to ports andterminals which receive large oceangoing ships, and potentially to largecommercial fishing facilities would ensure that ships would not be delayeddue to lack of APHIS facilities and that fishing ships had a location todispose of nets and net fragments. 12. Training and Education Three comments were received on the subject of training and education ofmariners. The Coast Guard will ensure that the discharge requirements ofAnnex V of MARPOL 73/78 appear on licensing and documentation examinationsfor U.S. Merchant Marine officers and appropriate documentation exams forunlicensed personnel. Moreover, when these rules are finalized, the CoastGuard expects that the Coast Guard Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadron and othersafety oriented organizations will include the requirements of the Actand these regulations in their boating courses for the recreational boater.13. Enforcement and Penalties The Coast Guard received four comment letters concerning enforcement ofAnnex V. One commenter suggested that the Coast Guard routinely take penaltyaction against foreign flag ships rather than refer violations to the Partyflag state. The Coast Guard believes that this comment is one which neednot be addressed by regulation. To the extent that procedures involvingreferral to the flag party state provides for the effective enforcementof Annex V prohibitions, the Coast Guard intends to employ those procedures.Where these procedures prove to be ineffective, or where the flag stateof the ship is not party to MARPOL 73/78, the Coast Guard intends to exerciseits civil penalty authority under the Act in a manner consistent with MARPOL73/78 and international law. Another commenter suggested the Coast Guard initiate a ``ticketing'' systemfor violations of Annex V. The Coast Guard is looking into such a systemfor this and other types of routine violations. One commenter asked theCoast Guard to clarify which level of government could enforce the provisionsof Annex V. In accordance with the Act, only the Coast Guard may assesscivil penalties under its provisions. Through Memoranda of Understandingor other agreements, the Coast Guard expects to receive enforcement assistancefrom other federal agencies, including APHIS and the National Marine FisheriesService. Moreover, the Coast Guard could receive third party notificationof violations of these regulations by individuals, local law enforcementofficials or state officials pursuant to existing or new Coast Guard-Stateagreements. One commenter requested the Coast Guard outline the ``Bounty System'' allowedfor by section 9 of the Act. This is in reference to the authorizationgranted to the Secretary of Transportation to return up to 50% of civilor criminal penalties collected to the person reporting Annex V relatedviolations. In view of the limited amount of time to address the mandatedprovisions of Annex V and the Act, the bounty provisions have not beenincluded in this proposal. The Coast Guard is considering the developmentof regulations implementing this provision which would be proposed in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> at a later date. 14. Environmental Impact One person commented that the Coast Guard was required to prepare an EnvironmentalImpact Statement as a part of this rulemaking. The Coast Guard has studiedthe environmental impacts that are possible as a result of this rule. TheCoast Guard's Draft Environmental Assessment is discussed in greater detailunder the heading ``Environmental Impact'' in Part VI below. Another commenterrequested that the Coast Guard consider the positive environmental benefitprovided by ``offshore marine waste processing facilities.'' These facilitiesare not yet operational and there is not enough known about them for theCoast Guard to quantify any environmental impacts. 15. Economic Impact Three comments were received concerning the economic impact of this rulemaking.One asked the Coast Guard to consider the positive economic benefits attributableto the reduction of beach cleanup costs, improvement of fisheries and preservationof wildlife and endangered species. The Coast Guard agrees that these arepositive benefits which should result from this rulemaking, but notes thatthese are difficult to estimate with reliability. Two other commentersnoted that the economic impact of these regulations upon drilling companieswould have a significant adverse economic impact on their industry. TheCoast Guard believes that certain industries and the operators of shipson certain trade routes will be economically impacted to a greater degreethan others. For example, the oil and mineral industry could be affectedmore than other sectors because of the restrictions imposed by Regulation4 of Annex V. Similarly, ships which operate predominantly in the specialareas are more likely to install costly equipment, such as incineratorsor compactors. One commenter from a large shipping company stated thatit was budgeting $80,000 per vessel for equipment installation. This figureis consistent with the Coast Guard's estimate of approximately $75,000for installation of a large incinerator. The potential economic impactof this rulemaking is discussed in Part VI below. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Section-by-Section Analysis of the Proposed Rules </ITAG>Sections of the proposed rules which are essentially self-explanatory arenot discussed in the section-by-section analysis that follows. 33 CFR 151.03 Applicability The existing applicability section would be revised to clearly indicatethat each subpart in this part (one for each Annex of MARPOL 73/78) nowcontains its own applicability statements. 33 CFR 151.05 Definitions This section would be revised by adding definitions of several new wordsrelevant to Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. They are discussed below: 1. ``Commercial fishing facility'' would be added to indicate that thesefacilities are considered ``ports'' for the purposes of these regulations.2. ``Garbage'' would be defined exactly as it appears in Annex V of MARPOL73/78. The most important concept in this definition is that ``garbage''for the purposes of these regulations must be ``ship-generated.'' Graywaterand dishwater, as discussed earlier, are <ITAG tagnum="54">not considered garbage within the meaning of Annex V. </ITAG>3. ``Harmful substance'' would be defined here exactly as it appears inMARPOL 73/78. It is important to note that ``garbage,'' including but notlimited to plastics, is considered to be a ``harmful substance'' sinceit is liable to ``create hazards to human health, to harm living resourcesand marine life, to damage amenities'' and because it is specifically subjectto control by MARPOL 73/78. 4. ``Plastic'' would be defined to provide a technically acceptable andvery broad definition of those materials which are prohibited from dischargeunder this proposal. An explanatory note would follow describing, to thenonscientific layman, the types of plastic items which are commonly foundon ships and likely to be discharged. The proposed definition would includesynthetic materials, including what are called ``biodegradable'' plastics.These plastics often consist of polymers connected by starch moleculeswhich cause the plastic to break down when exposed to sunlight or water.The Coast Guard is concerned that the exclusion of biodegradable plasticsfrom the definition of plastic might lead to a transfer of entanglementrelated environmental damages to ingestion related ones. The proposed definitionis meant to include both plastic products, raw resin pellets and compositeproducts in which the plastic component is a minor, but essential elementin its functioning, for example, in a plastic-lined paper cup. This definitionexcludes glass, paints, varnishes, waxes (all of which might be considered``plastics'' by other definitions), and plastic polymers naturally producedby living organisms but harvested and used by man, such as chitin. ``Clinkers''of plastic or pieces which have not been fully reduced to ash by incineration,would still be considered ``plastic'' under these regulations. 5. ``Recreational boating facility'' would be defined to indicate thatthese are considered ``ports'' for the purposes of these regulations. 6. ``Special area'' would be revised to indicate the new sections in theregulations where each Annex's special areas are defined. The MediterraneanSea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea, the Red Sea and the Gulf areas are currentlydesignated as special areas for both Annex I and Annex V. 7. ``Victual waste'' would be defined to include ``food wastes'' sincethis latter term is used throughout Annex V but is not defined therein.``Victual wastes'' and ``food wastes'' are interchangeable terms withinthe meaning of Annex V, however, the proposed regulations refer only tothe term ``victual wastes'' for consistency. 33 CFR 151.08 Denial of Entry A new paragraph (b) would be added to indicate that the Captain of thePort (COTP) may deny ships entry to ports and terminals which do not ensurethe availability of adequate reception facilities for Annex V or for thoseports and terminals required to hold a COA which do not have one. 33 CFR 151.09  The existing section ``Control of discharge of oil'' would be redesignatedas 33 CFR 151.10 and a new ``Applicability'' section would be added inits place to list which ships must comply with Subpart B (Annex I of MARPOL73/78). The Coast Guard believes that separate applicability sections wouldmake it more clear to industry and enforcement personnel exactly whichAnnexes apply to which ships. 33 CFR 151.11 Exceptions for Emergencies Paragraph (a) would be revised to change the existing 33 CFR 151.09 referenceto read 33 CFR 151.10. 33 CFR 151.13 Special Areas for Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 This section would be revised to indicate that the special areas indicatedapply to Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. This revision would also correct typographicalerrors in the description of the Mediterranean Sea and Gulfs Areas so thatthese two area descriptions read exactly as they appear in MARPOL 73/78.Finally, paragraph (g) would change the reference to ``151.09'' to read``151.10'' to agree with the proposed reorganization. 33 CFR 151.30 Applicability This section would list the ships which are subject to regulations implementingAnnex II of MARPOL 73/78 without requiring the reader to make a cross-referenceto the Annex I applicability, as is required now. This section currentlyappears as an exception to the applicability of Annex I in 33 CFR 151.03(a)(4).As proposed, there would be no difference between the old and new references,except that readability would be improved. Subpart D This proposed subpart would contain the regulatory additions necessaryto implement the recent amendments to the Act and, concurrently, wouldimplement Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. The proposed rules in Subpart D delineateshipboard requirements only. 33 CFR 151.51 Applicability This section would define the ships that are subject to regulations implementingAnnex V of MARPOL 73/78. This subpart would apply to all U.S. ships whereverlocated, and to foreign flag vessels (whether party to MARPOL 73/78 ornot) when in the navigable waters of the U.S. or within the 200 mile ExclusiveEconomic Zone of the U.S. Readers should be aware that ``ship'' as definedin andSection; 151.05 includes ``all marine craft operating in the marineenvironment.'' Excluded from applicability of these regulations are U.S.government owned or operated ships if they are in noncommercial serviceand other vessels excluded by MARPOL 73/78. 33 CFR 151.53 Special Areas for Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 This section would state the special areas for Annex V. They are currentlythe same as for Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. The Coast Guard specified thisas a separate section as an aid to the reader and to allow for the additionof other sea areas which have been proposed for designation under AnnexV. An explanatory note has been added below this section to advise thereader that while these sea areas are defined as special areas, the dischargerestrictions in proposed 33 CFR 151.71 would not go into effect until asufficient number of states bordering the special area have notified IMOthat reception facilities are available. IMO must also provide one year'snotice to party states as to the effective date. 33 CFR 151.55 151.57 and 151.59 Recordkeeping Requirements, Waste ManagementPlans, and Placards These sections would be reserved for a futrue rulemaking and would specifyrequirements for these three items authorized under the Act. 33 CFR 151.61 Inspection for Compliance and Enforcement This section would allow the Coast Guard or other authorized federal agenciesto inspect vessels to determine if they are operating in  <ITAG tagnum="54">accordance with these regulations and Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Aspart of the enforcement program, other federal agencies, such as APHISand NMFS may inspect ships and report noncompliance to the Coast Guardfor action.</ITAG>33 CFR 151.63 Control of Discharges of Plastic or GarbageThis section would contain substantive enforcement requirements for thesubpart. It provides that unless the person in charge of a ship can provethat no plastics are on board which might require disposal ashore, thatperson must discharge ship-generated garbage in accordance with paragraph(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, depending on whether plastics are separatedbefore discharge or not. If plastics are separated on board ship, thenremaining garbage may be either discharged (if allowed by andSection;151.69,andSection;151.71 or andSection;151.73), incinerated, or retained on boardfor later shore disposal. If plastics are not separated on board ship,garbage containing mixtures of plastic and other garbage must be eitherincinerated on board ship or retained on board for later shoreside disposaland garbage containing no plastics may be handled as allowed by paragraph(a)(1) of this section. If the master, operator, or person in charge ofa ship has plastics requiring disposal aboard the ship and cannot showcompliance with paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this seciton, it will bepresumed that Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 has been violated. This section willform the basis of a multi-agency federal enforcement program.33 CFR 151.65 Reporting Requirements for Garbage Regulated by USDAThis section would require ship operators to advise the port or terminal24 hours in advance of arrival of the need for an APHIS reception facility.The Coast Guard believes this section is necessary based upon commentsreceived and upon the fact that most terminals will not have their ownAPHIS approved reception facility but will instead contract for these services.This reporting requirement would lessen the possibility that ships wouldbe unduly delayed while waiting to offload APHIS regulated garbage.33 CFR 151.67 Operating Requirements: Disposal of PlasticThis section would contain the shipboard operating procedures for disposalof plastics. No person onboard U.S. ships, wherever located, may dischargeplastics into the sea. Also, no person onboard foreign flag ships, bothparty and nonparty to MARPOL 73/78, may discharge plastics into the navigablewaters or 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States. Consistentwith MARPOL 73/78, this section indicates that if plastics are mixed withnon-plastics, then the entire mixture must be treated as though it wereplastic.33 CFR 151.69 Operating Requirements: Disposal of Garbage Outside SpecialAreasThis section would implement Regulation 3 of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78, establishthree discharge zones as measured seaward from the baseline of the territorialsea, and prescribe allowable discharge requirements for persons on boardships located outside the special areas defined in andSection;151.53.33 CFR 151.71 Operating Requirements: Disposal of Garbage Within SpecialAreasThis section would implement Regulation 5 of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Becausethe special areas are sea areas which are already severely polluted orare more likely to become polluted because of their unique oceanographicconditions, extraordinary discharge requirements are mandated. In theseareas, only victual wastes may be discharged at sea, and then only whena ship is at least 12 nautical miles from the nearest land. No other dischargeof garbage would be permitted.33 CFR 151.73 Operating Requirements: Disposal of Garbage from Fixed orFloating PlatformsThis section would implement Regulation 4 of MARPOL 73/78. It prohibitsthe discharge of garbage from all fixed or floating platforms which areengaged in the exploration, exploitation or associated offshore processingof seabed mineral resources. This prohibition also extends to all shipsalongside or within 500 meters of such platforms. Beyond 12 nautical miles,only comminuted or ground victual wastes could be discharged into the seafrom platforms or from ships alongside or within 500 meters of the platforms.The intent of this stringent requirement is to prevent the seabed beneathstationary vessels such as mobile offshore drilling units (MODU's), oilrigs, platforms, drillships, etc. from being inundated with ship-generatedgarbage. The Coast Guard interprets the phrase ``exploration'' to havethe same meaning as the definition found in 33 CFR 140.10 and that ``exploitation''is intended to mean the actual taking of seabed mineral resources.33 CFR 151.75 Grinders or ComminutersThis section would specify a performance standard to discharge certaingarbage at the distances from nearest land specified in andSection;151.69(a)(2)or andSection;151.73(b). The Coast Guard does not intend that each grinderor comminuter must have the screen attached, but they must be able to demonstratecompliance with this performance standard if requested by an authorizedfederal official.33 CFR 151.81 Penalties for ViolationThis section would be added as a clear statement of the penalties authorizedunder the Act.33 CFR 155.350(a)(2) and 155.400(b)(2)These sections would be revised by correcting references to ``151.09''to ``151.10.''33 CFR 158.100 PurposeThis section would be revised by adding a new paragraph (b)(3) to indicatethat the purpose of the subpart is also to show the procedures for certifyingthe adequacy of reception facilities for garbage.33 CFR 158.110 ApplicabilityThis section would revise the existing applicability section to show thatSubparts B, C, and E of Part 158 apply to ports and terminals that receiveAnnex I and II ships, as well as to ship repair yards. Paragraph (b) wouldbe added to indicate that all ports and terminals within, or subject tothe jurisdiction of the United States, must comply with the reception facilitycriteria of Subpart D. For the purposes of Annex V, ports include, butare not limited to, terminals and facilities which receive Annex I or IIships, or that are commercial fishing facilities, mineral and oil industry``shorebases'' or recreational boating facilities, as defined later.33 CFR 158.120 Definitions and AcronymsThis section would be revised by adding new definitions of ``Certificatesof Adequacy'', ``Commercial fishing facility'', ``Form C'', ``Garbage'',``Harmful substance'', ``Mineral and oil industry shorebases'', ``Receptionfacility'', ``Recreational boating facility'' and ``The Act''. Some ofthese are identical to their definitions in 33 CFR 151.05. The <ITAG tagnum="54">remaining are discussed below: </ITAG>1. ``Certificate of Adequacy'' would be amended from its former definitionto clarify that this form is issued by the Coast Guard and indicates thatthe port or terminal meets the requirements of the appropriate subpartto show compliance with Annex I, II or V of MARPOL 73/78.2. ``Commercial fishing facility'', ``Recreational boating facility'',and ``Mineral and oil industry shorebases'' would be added to indicatethat they are specific types of ports which must comply with the receptionfacility requirements of Annex V.3. ``Form C'' would be added to indicate the name of the application formfor a COA for garbage. Most persons in charge of a port or terminal wouldnot have to complete Form C and be issued a COA, though all would be requiredto meet the reception facility requirements in 33 CFR 158.410 and 158.420.Form C appears later in this document, at the end of the preamble, as AppendixB.4. ``Reception facility'' would be revised to add descriptive terms specificto an Annex V reception facility. The term is broadly defined but connotesthe physical containment in which garbage is stored or conveyed. AnnexV reception facilities may be ``dumpsters'' or other garbage containers,or even mobile facilities, such as a modified ship or barge.<T3>33 CFR 158.130 Delegations</T3>This section would be revised for clarity and to reflect the new delegationof authority to the COTP for Annex V. Paragraph (e)(1) delegates authorityto the COTP to deny entry to ships to Annex I, II or V ports or terminalsrequired to have a COA. Paragraph (e)(2) delegates the authority to denyentry to ports and terminals required to have adequate reception facilities,but are not required to have a COA.<T3>33 CFR 158.135 Who Must Have a Certificate of Adequacy?</T3>This section would be added to clarify who must have a COA. Addition ofthis section is necessary since all Annex I and II ports and terminalsare required to be issued COAs and it is proposed that only a small portionof Annex V ports and terminals would be required to have COAs. Ports andterminals subject to Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 would have to hold COAs ifthey receive ships subject to Annex I or II of MARPOL 73/78. The CoastGuard is still considering issuing COAs to commercial fishing facilitiesto ensure that commercial fishermen have reception facilities to disposeof nets and net fragments.<T3>33 CFR 158.140 Applying for a Certificate of Adequacy</T3>This section would be revised by adding paragraph (a)(2). Until June 30,1989 all Annex V COA applications made on Form C would be submitted toU.S. Coast Guard Headquarters at the address indicated on Form C. Afterthis date, local COTPs will review and issue COAs to qualifying ports andterminals.<T3>33 CFR 158.160 Issuance and Termination of a Certificate of Adequacy</T3>This section would be revised to provide for the issuance, revocation,suspension and termination of Annex V COAs. This section spells out theresponsibility of the COTP to physically inspect Annex I or II receptionfacilities prior to issuing a COA and the COTP's responsibility only toreview an Annex V reception facility application.<T3>33 CFR 158.163 Reception Facility Operations</T3>Paragraph (b)(2) would be revised by adding the word ``operator'' to indicatethat an operator of a ship, in addition to a master, is authorized to examinea port or terminal's COA.<T3>33 CFR 158.165 Certificates of Adequacy: Change of Information</T3>This section would be revised for clarity and would list those sectionsof Form C which would, if changed, require written notification to thelocal COTP.<T3>33 CFR 158.167 Penalties for Violation</T3>This section would be added as a clear statement of the penalties authorizedunder the Act.<T3>Subpart D_Criteria for Adequacy of Reception Facilities: Garbage</T3>This new subpart would describe the criteria for determining the adequacyfor Annex V reception facilities. All ports and terminals, whether or notthey must have a COA, would have to comply with the requirements of andSection;andSection;158.410 and 158.420.<T3>33 CFR 158.410 Reception Facilities: General</T3>This section would contain the general requirements for Annex V receptionfacilities. It places the burden upon the port or terminal operator toensure that it holds all federal, state and local permits for the handlingof garbage. Ports and terminals which have an APHIS reception facility,autoclave or incinerator located on their property must have an APHIS ComplianceAgreement for both the means of conveyance to and from ships and for thedevice which incinerates or sterilizes the garbage. Reception facilitiesfor APHIS regulated wastes should be properly identified in accordancewith APHIS Compliance Agreements. APHIS requires that a separate receptionfacility be available for APHIS regulated materials so that other nonregulatedgarbage not become contaminated. In absence of separate facilities, allgarbage deposited in a garbage reception facility, if it contains any APHISregulated garbage, must be treated in accordance with APHIS regulations.If a port or terminal contracts out for APHIS approved services, the contractormust obtain the certifications required by APHIS.A port or terminal which receives more than 25 port arrivals annually byships whose last port of call was outside the continental United Statesor Canada would have to show on Form C the name of the APHIS approved contractor.A port or terminal must also ensure that a reception facility (garbagecontainer, ``dumpster'', etc.) is located so that garbage deposited fromships would not readily be able to enter the water and so that it willnot interfere with terminal operations. Terminals such as ship repair yardswould not have to provide APHIS reception facilities within 24 hours, ifthey could provide facilities before a ship departed. Finally, ports andterminals would have to ensure that APHIS garbage facilities were availablewithin 24 hours after notice is given by ships.33 CFR 158.420 Reception Facilities: Capacity and ExceptionsPorts and terminals would have to ensure the availability of garbage receptionfacilities capable of receiving all garbage that the master or person whois in charge of a ship wants to discharge ashore, subject to two exceptions.Ports and terminals would not be obligated to receive large quantitiesof spoiled or damaged cargoes not usually <ITAG tagnum="54">discharged, or garbage from ships not having commercial transactionswith that port or terminal. </ITAG>Subpart E_Port and Terminal OperationsThe existing Subpart D would be redesignated ``Subpart E'' to order toallow for the placement of a new Subpart D implementing the reception facilityrequirements of Annex V in numerical sequence immediately after AnnexesI and II requirements. Sections 158.400 and 158.420 would be redesignatedandSection;andSection; 158.500 and 158.520 respectively. 46 CFR 25.50-1 Criteria This section would require vessels not normally inspected by the CoastGuard to retain garbage generated on board for later disposal ashore, unlessit can discharge garbage at sea in accordance with 33 CFR Part 151. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>The Coast Guard considers the proposed regulations to be significant underDOT regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979)and non-major under Executive Order 12291. A draft regulatory evaluationhas been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. Copies of the evaluationmay be inspected or copied as indicated in the first paragraph of <T2>Addresses </T2>above. The Coast Guard considerd several alternatives in this rulemaking: takeno regulatory action except for determining the criteria of adequacy forreception facilities; develop a performance-based regulatory program requiringinspection of reception facilities at all ports and terminals before issuingCOAs to those which meet standards; or develop a performance-based regulatoryprogram requiring all ports and terminals to meet minimal reception facilitystandards and issue certain ports and terminals COAs after they have certifiedtheir compliance with the regulations. The Coast Guard decided on the final option to implement the requirementsof Pub. L. 100-200. The decision was based on several factors. A performancebased regulatory program was selected as it was best suited for implementationof legislation prohibiting improper disposal of garbage. Performance standardregulatory programs are more conducive to compliance choices that are customfitted to individual entities. The Coast Guard considered the costs of the implementation of these regulationsby considering six distinct industry sectors: merchant shipping, the fishingindustry, recreational boating, offshore oil and gas operations, researchand other miscellaneous classes of vessels, and ports and terminals. Only those portions of each sector affected by implementation of Pub. L.100-220 were considered. Vessels on the Great Lakes and internal watersof the United States were not considered as they must currently complywith the provisions of the Refuse Act. Ports and terminals were consideredin all areas for the additional burden that provisions for additional wastecollection would entail. Costs for each of these sectors were projectedafter an industry profile was constructed and current garbage disposalpractices were analyzed to establish baseline costs. Estimates of costcompliance options were made for each sector except ports and terminals,which were based on a different set of compliance options. Estimates ofwhich compliance options each industry sector would choose were made andthe total costs were projected based on these compliance options. The totalannual projected costs are approximately $41.7 million. This burden isapportioned among the sectors as follows: Merchant shipping, $2.9 million;commercial fishing, $33.9 million; recreational boating, $1.4 million;offshore oil and gas, $0.9 million; miscellaneous vessels, $.4 million;and ports $2.2 million. Plastic in the ocean originates from several sources, not solely from thevessels regulated by these proposed rules. Combined with a paucity of data,the quantitative estimation of benefits of compliance with the proposedregulations becomes problematic. The Coast Guard requests comments fromstate and local governments on the amount of marine debris in their jurisdiction,the cost associated with properly disposing of that debris, and estimatesas to the amount of that debris originating from ships. This section identifies quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits fromimplementation of Pub. L. 100-220. Most quantifiable benefits result fromsavings due to events of pollution not occurring. One source of benefitswould accrue from the reduction of damages to vessels from garbage entanglementin propellers, water intakes or other vessel equipment in contact withthe water. Benefits could also be realized through avoidance of fisherylosses due to ``ghost fishing'' by discarded nets and traps that continueto catch fish or mammals. Another large benefit would be the reductionof beach cleanup costs. Beach debris problems tend to be localized to specificareas that receive wastes carried on principal ocean currents or that arein proximity to heavily traveled shipping routes or fishing regions. Thequantity of plastic, garbage and other debris discharged in the ocean willbe reduced under this regulation. However, numerous other sources of plasticwaste will not be affected by this regulation. It is uncertain whetherbeach areas will continue to require cleanup efforts, or if the cleanupefforts can be substantially reduced. Therefore, it is not possible toascribe a quantitative estimate to reduction in beach cleanup costs. Anotherbenefit closely tied to the reduction in beach cleanup costs is increasedtourism and its associated spending in beach areas. Again it is difficultto quantify the change that these regulations will have on tourist spendingin beach areas. Finally, one could consider increases in the values ofbeach properties. A net public gain occurs from improvement in ocean environmentalconditions to the extent that beach property increases in value. Environmental benefits are difficult to quantify but their effects canbe considered. These benefits include a reduction in damages by plasticwastes to endangered species and the increased enjoyment of beach areas.Plastic garbage is believed to have deleterious effects on certain endangeredspecies including Hawaiian monk seals and various species of sea turtles.This proposed regulation will limit one source of oceanic plastic garbageaffecting these species. Persons visiting a beach will receive increasedenjoyment of the resource to the extent that less debris is present. The potential net benefits of the proposed regulations are estimated tobe positive. The estimate results from an analysis that <ITAG tagnum="54">considered potential costs and benefits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>A regulatory flexibility analysis was conducted to evaluate the impactof the proposal on small entities and it has been made part of the DraftRegulatory Evaluation in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The Coast Guard is proposing to adopt the Small Business Administration's(SBA) definition of ``small business'' used when considering SBA loansto concerns engaging in transportation and warehousing (13 CFR 121.3 through121.10) as a definition for small entities. A concern is considered small,under this definition, if its annual receipts do not exceed $1.5 million.The Coast Guard does not have accurate information on how many vesselsor ports and terminals grouped in the various sectors discussed in the``Potential Costs'' portion would qualify as small entities. However, theCoast Guard currently estimates that this will effect 2,200 U.S. flag vesselsof less than 1000 gross tons, 14,800 commercial fishing vessels, 600 offshoreservice vessels, and 4,400 ports and terminals, including recreationalboating facilities. Any person affected by the proposed regulations whobelieves that they qualify as a small entity or has information concerningsmall entity impacts is requested to submit information on the basis fortheir qualification and the anticipated impact. Vessels which qualify assmall entities will decide which option they will choose for compliance:a. Garbage separation, with storage of plastic waste on board and finaldisposal ashore; b. Storage of all garbage and final disposal ashore; c. Garbage separation, with compaction and storage of plastic wastes onboard and final disposal ashore; d. Garbage incineration; e. Product substitution. Ports which qualify as small entities may have to invest in small-scaleincineration equipment, equipment for garbage handling, or make contractualarrangements for reception facilities if they do not already have these.These proposals contain minimal reporting or recordkeeping requirementsfor small entities. A small minority of all ports and terminals will alsobe required to complete an application ``Form C'' for a COA. Most vesselswhich are small entities would not have to comply with the reporting requirementsfor disposal of APHIS regulated garbage. Based on a worst case estimateof 4.2 percent of the combined income cost of compliance for small vessels,the Coast Guard certifies that if the proposed rules are adopted, theywill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. As discussed throughout the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, </T2>some existing legislation may duplicate,conflict or overlap with the proposed rule. Some of these include the CleanAir Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The CleanAir Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act may restrict the useof incinerators as a compliance choice for vessels in U.S. waters. Specifically,the Clean Air Act may restrict emissions from incinerators and the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act may restrict the shore disposal of clinkersor ashes from vessel incinerators. The Clean Water Act also prohibits thedischarge of pollutants, including garbage, in U.S. waters. There is aduplication of the proposed rule and regulations implementing the CleanWater Act for floating garbage and an inconsistency between them for non-floatingsolid wastes in that the proposed rule would prohibit the discharge ofnon-floating wastes from mobile offshore drilling units and platforms,while the Clean Water Act regulations would allow this type of discharge.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact</ITAG>Under Annex V of MARPOL 73/78, the Act, and these proposed regulations,the discharge of plastic from vessels into the sea will be prohibited andthe discharge of other ship-generated garbage within 25 nautical milesof land will be restricted. Ports and terminals where ships call wouldalso be required to provide adequate facilities for receiving this garbage.The reception facility rules in this document do not directly affect themarine environment, but they are an essential part of an overall schemeto limit pollution of the marine environment and substantially reduce theneed to dispose of plastics and other ship-generated garbage at sea. Theproposed facility regulations will affect the locations where ship-generatedgarbage is received by reception facilities, implementing the requirementsof Regulation 7 of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78, that adequate reception facilitiesbe available to meet the needs of ships without undue delay. If left unregulated,ships would not be able to discharge garbage, especially APHIS regulatedgarbage, at all ports and terminals because reception facilities wouldnot be readily available. Further, in those ports and terminals where receptionfacilities would be available, the demand for reception facilities wouldexceed the supply. This would drive up the cost of disposal, contributeto the delay of vessels, and adversely affect compliance with the dischargerequirements of Annex V and the Act. The regulations are expected to have a beneficial effect on the environmentby contributing to the reduction of the occurrence of plastic in the marineenvironment as well as other ship-generated garbage. However, the impactof the proposed action involves two factors. First, is the source of themarine debris. The proposed regulations apply to U.S. vessels and foreignflag vessels when operating in U.S. waters. U.S. vessels account for lessthan 5% of the world fleet. Foreign flag vessels which operate in U.S.waters make up a much larger percentage of this fleet. Once outside U.S.waters, foreign flag vessels from a country not signatory to Annex V, arenot required to comply with these regulations and may continue past disposalpractices. Over 1,000 public vessels in noncommercial service, includingnaval vessels and other government owned or operated ships, have untilfive years after the effective date <ITAG tagnum="54">these regulations to comply with regulations established by theirown agencies to implement the requirements of Annex V. Further, these regulationsdo not apply to land based sources which, depending upon the predominantactivity in the region, may account for more than half of the debris inthe marine environment. Therefore, this action can influence only a ratherlimited portion of the overall marine debris problem.</ITAG>The second factor is the marine environment. Several negative impacts frommarine debris have been noted on marine wildlife including selected endangeredspecies. The effect of this regulatory program on these impacts will belimited for several reasons. First, the proposed action will have limitedinfluence on the overall marine debris problem. Second, there is littleevidence to suggest that persistent marine debris has had a significantadverse impact on environmental populations. There is ample evidence thatentanglement and ingestion of persistent marine debris have had an adverseaffect on individual members of many species; however, scientists can identifyadverse impacts on only a few wildlife populations, e.g., Northern furseals and the endangered Hawaiian monk seals. Third, the proposed regulationsdo not affect accidental loss of fishing gear or active fishing operations,which are major contributors to the issue of entanglement. Fourth, plasticsaccount for a small portion of the debris disposed of by ships. The bulkof ship-generated garbage is still permitted to be discharged further outat sea.A draft environmental assessment of these regulations has been preparedand may be inspected or copied at the address indicated in paragraph of<T2>ADDRESSES</T2> above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This proposal would change the information collection requirements at 33CFR 151.65 and 33 CFR 158.40.

They have been assigned RCS/OMB Control Numbers 2115-0544and 2115-0543 respectively. This proposal would make it mandatory for mastersto give 24 hours notice of the need for an APHIS approved reception facilityand for all ports and terminals which meet the requirements of 33 CFR 158.40to apply for a COA for Garbage.
