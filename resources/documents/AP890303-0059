In the West Bank, the army blew up seven houses and sealed aneighth late Thursday and early today. The homes belonged toPalestinians suspected of killing an Arab collaborator and throwingfirebombs at Israeli cars and homes, the army said.   In the Gaza Strip, the army sealed rooms in two houses belongingto Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at an Israeligovernment office and setting on fire a bus carrying workers toIsrael.   Since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987,the army has destroyed or sealed more than 200 houses, usuallybefore suspects were convicted of any wrongdoing.   The United States condemns the practice, saying it violates theright to due process of law.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, said a battle Thursdayin south Lebanon between Israeli troops and four PalestineLiberation Organization guerrillas showed the organization is``making fun of its promise to stop terrorism.''   Officials said the four guerrillas, who were killed, had beentrying to infiltrate Israel on a hostage-taking mission.   ``Despite the explicit PLO promise to the United States that itwould stop terror actions against Israel, the infiltration attemptis a decisive proof that this terrorist organization is carrying outterror acts,'' Shamir told the daily Yediot Ahronot.   The United States opened direct contacts with the PLO in Decemberafter PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said he was renouncing terrorismand recognizing Israel.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said today that the latestinfiltration attempt violated the U.S conditions.   Asked whether Israel was trying to persuade Washington to end thecontacts, Liel said: ``We are forwarding the information regardingthese attacks on a regular basis to the United States, but theyshould draw their own conclusions.''</TEXT></DOC>
