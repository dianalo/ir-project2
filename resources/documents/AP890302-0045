The embryo of an endangered Indian desert cat was implanted intothe house cat by in vitro fertilization, Cincinnati Zoo officialssaid Wednesday. The offspring was born Feb. 7.   ``There are millions of domestic cats, and so few of these exoticcats,'' said Betsy Dresser, research director at the zoo's Centerfor Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife.   Zoo officials said they believed it was the first time a commondomestic cat was used as the surrogate mother.   The University of Florida veterinary school has implanted embryosfrom the endangered Florida panther in Texas mountain lions, and invitro fertilization involving a leopard cat has been used at theNational Zoo in Washington, D.C.   The Cincinnati center has made breakthroughs during the past fewyears with its work in embryo transplants from one species toanother. Researchers successfully have frozen embryos, thawed themand transplanted them into other animals.   The aim is to develop the technology and techniques fortransplanting embryos from endangered species into more commonanimals, thus increasing the chances of the species' survival.   The center has successfully transplanted the embryos of an exoticspecies to a common one with different types of antelope and cows.   Ms. Dresser's work was praised by an official at the San DiegoZoo, which also has been researching how to help reproduction ofendangered animal species.   ``We salute this type of work because there are so many speciesin dire straits today. Any method devoted to the enhancement ofproduction of endangered species, our organization whole-heartedlysupports,'' said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the San Diego Zoo WildAnimal Park.   Ms. Dresser said the center has been studying cats for severalyears to learn more about their reproduction for such a transfer.Eggs and sperm were gathered from desert cats, the eggs werefertilized in a glass dish, and the embryos were implanted in thedomestic cat. Two embryos survived, but one of the kittens was borndead.   The desert cat is a close relative to the domestic cat, withsimilar size and appearance.   The mother is treating the kitten like a regular offspring, butthe kitten won't take on characteristics of the mother.   ``She thinks she had the ugliest kid on the block,'' Dresserjoked. ``Every time you pick up the desert cat and put it back, shegives it a bath.''   The researchers decided to use two closely related types of catfor the first transfer. They are not sure which other cat speciesare close enough to permit such transfers.   ``We don't know in the relationships how far away you can go,''Ms. Dresser said.   The next round of work at the center will involve transfers ofjungle cat and golden cat embryos. The work also will help themunderstand the similiarities and differences between cat species.   ``This is a new way to allow us to look at the physiologicalside,'' Ms. Dresser said.</TEXT></DOC>
