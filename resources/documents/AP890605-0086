(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A divorcee who was told by the stateSupreme Court that she cannot let her boyfriend spend the nightwhile her three children are home has appealed to the U.S. SupremeCourt, her lawyer said Monday.   Carla J. Parrillo's appeal asserts that the state court deprivedher of a ``fundamental right to be free from government influencewithin the confines of her own home,'' said Patrica A. Hurst, anAmerican Civil Liberties Union lawyer.   Hurst said the state decision, in a case initiated by Ms.Parrillo's ex-husband, has affected her client's rights as a parentto ``organize the care and custody of her children'' and ``toconduct her life as she deems fit.''   ``The fact that the state of Rhode Island stepped into her hometo regulate her conduct is something that we all find veryoffensive,'' Hurst said at a news conference.   ``Until someone can prove that I'm harming my children, I willcontinue to live my life as I see fit,'' Ms. Parrillo, 33, ofJohnston, said Monday.   The state Supreme Court upheld a Family Court decision in March,saying ``we see no great constitutional issue in this controversy.''   Ms. Parrillo's boyfriend ``may still visit the marital domicileovernight, with the exception of those times when the children arewith their mother,'' the court wrote.   Hurst had argued that the 1986 decision by Family Court JudgeWilliam Goldberg, now retired, was based on the judge's personalopinions on family life.   ``A transcript of the conversation between the trial justice andthe children is devoid of any facts which could support the judge'sinference'' of harm to the children, Hurst said. She added thatGoldberg rejected her request to have an independent psychologistexamine the children to determine if the overnight visits wereharming them.   Ms. Parrillo and her husband, Justin Parrillo Jr., were divorcedin May 1986 after seven years of marriage and she was given custodyof her children, aged 9, 11 and 13 at the time. He was givenvisitation rights.   In June, the Parrillos returned to Family Court. Ms. Parrillowanted her ex-husband to see the children away from her home.Parrillo wanted his ex-wife restrained from having any unrelatedmales stay overnight at her house.   Ms. Parrillo maintained that overnight visits by her boyfriend,Joseph DiPippo, once or twice a week caused no harm to herchildren. She testified that they liked DiPippo, but she did notplan to marry him in the near future.   Parrillo felt his children didn't like the situation, andnoticed a change in their behavior, according to his attorney,Thomas DeSimone.   The children told Goldberg in a private meeting that they allgot along well with DiPippo, although the eldest said there weretimes he did not like the man.   The judge ruled the overnight visits ``in the presence of thechildren were not conducive to their general well-being, at leastin terms of their psychological welfare,'' the high court noted.   Goldberg said if Ms. Parrillo married DiPippo, the issue wouldbecome moot.   ``No one gave Carla Parrillo credit for knowing what was rightfor her kids as a mother,'' said Hurst, who maintained Ms.Parrillo's decision to introduce a man to the family slowly waseasier on the children than an abrupt marriage.</TEXT></DOC>
