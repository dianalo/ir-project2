They prove that the distribution m(t,chi)of the RNA level (chi) in the dividing cells at a given time (t) tendsto exp ({lambda}t){mu}*(chi), as t tends to infinity, i.e., that thereexists the so-called exponential steady state for the model, and thatperturbed cell populations reach this state in the limit. The resultis obtained by applying the semigroup theory to a functional integralequation describing the evolution of m(t,chi) in time. For a varietyof reasons, the analysis requires explicit characterization of the semigroupspectrum. The asymptotic result may be viewed as a generalization ofsimilar results for the generalized branching processes with continuoustime, under less restrictive assumptions. Also, they discuss relatedmodels and asymptotic results including the results obtained using thenotion of essential spectrum of an operator. The present paper is a continuationof another work in which the biological background and discussions wereprovided.</TEXT></DOC>
