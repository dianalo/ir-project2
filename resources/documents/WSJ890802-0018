The measure incorporates cuts voted last week in such major weapon systems as the Midgetman mobile missile and B-2 bomber, but goes beyond the authorizing bill in reducing classified programs and shifting funds to improve military readiness. The advanced cruise missile cut is part of an estimated $2 billion reduction from the Pentagon's request for secret, or so-called black, programs and the rejection of new money for the advanced tactical fighter is a major blow to the Air Force.    By comparison, the bill adds $1 billion for six sealift cargo ships and tankers. The mix of aircraft purchases is particularly beneficial for Grumman Corp. The New York-based company is one of few leading aerospace contractors without an investment in the advanced tactical fighter, and the House bill adds $893 million to the Bush administration's budget to finance the purchase of the 24 new F-14 jet fighters and 12 EA-6B Prowlers produced by Grumman.    Though the bill conforms with the appropriations ceiling set by the budget summit last spring, it will take major steps by the Pentagon to stay within the prescribed $281.9 billion limit on direct spending. The bill imposes a fixed cap to satisfy budgeteers. But unless adjustments are made, the measure would lead to spending $1.8 billion above this level.    The committee action came as the full House approved a stripped-down $5.8 billion bill covering the Commerce, State and Justice Departments, and two significant business-related amendments were attached to an $18.4 billion Treasury bill pending in the Senate.    A House-passed ban on the enforcement of new tax rules related to employee-benefit plans won endorsement from a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, which also moved to curb the growing practice of credit-card companies selling their services in partnership with nonprofit organizations in order to get subsidized lower mail rates. An estimated 750,000 pieces of mail are expected to be generated under such marketing schemes in the next year, and the committee said the Postal Service could save $30 million in fiscal 1990 by withholding the lower rate.    Measured against current appropriations, yesterday's Pentagon bill is most striking in the shift of priorities from research and development to military readiness accounts. More than $4 billion would be added to operations and maintenance, while research and development programs would be reduced almost $2 billion -- including the additional $693 million cut last week from the Strategic Defense Initiative.    Among the services, the Air Force appears most vulnerable. Implicit in many of the cuts is a criticism of the department's management of major programs. Apart from the tactical fighter and advanced cruise missile, the committee cut deeply from funding for the service's advanced radar-warning receiver. The decision is most significant to Loral Corp., which has been implicated in the Pentagon procurement scandal and whose Air Force contract on the receiver program has been recommended for termination by the General Accounting Office.    As amended yesterday, the bill reflects increased funding for drug interdiction authorized by the full House last week. But equally important are the shifts in a range of often more prosaic accounts. The measure cuts $861 million, for example, from the Pentagon's request for automatic data processing, and an estimated $513 million is added elsewhere for depot maintenance.    From ammunition to field kitchens, the measure reflects a preoccupation with conventional forces that is part of the pork-barrel politics of defense appropriations but also bears the stamp of Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.), the new defense subcommittee chairman and a Marine combat veteran.    The reduction in troop levels will fall on the Army and Air Force and is accompanied by a $1.2 billion increase to repair barracks and base facilities and for medical care for current military personnel and their families. The last issue has been a crusade of sorts for the Pennsylvania Democrat, and he has used his new power as well to build his strength at home. For example, $300 million was allocated to the Transportation Department to help the Coast Guard, and he, in turn, won $13.7 million for an unauthorized highway project in Pennsylvania in a pending transportation bill that won waivers from the leadership's Rules Committee yesterday.    The separate $5.8 billion bill approved by the House yesterday covers less than a third of the expected costs for the Commerce, State and Justice Departments. Among the major accounts funded are $1.42 billion for the 1990 census and $50 million to begin promised reparations to Japanese-Americans interned in camps during World War II.    The census funds provoked a seesaw debate over how undocumented aliens are counted for the purposes of reapportionment -- an issue that pits lawmakers from older, declining districts against those from the burgeoning Southwest, where immigrants have added to the population.    On a 227-197 roll call, the House first signaled its support of a GOP-sponsored amendment to block the census from &quot;knowingly&quot; counting illegal aliens. But Democrats closed ranks when the appropriations leadership moved to sidetrack the proposal on procedural grounds. By a 288-134 margin, the House upheld a parliamentary ruling that the amendment was out of order on a spending bill, and when the GOP leadership sought to join the issue in a second later appeal, the motion was tabled 249-172.    Critics of the amendment argue that the restrictions are unworkable and unconstitutional. But the Senate already has adopted similar language as part of a recent immigration bill, and the early House roll call reflected significant support. Republicans were helped by their choice of sponsor -- Rep. Thomas Ridge, a popular Pennsylvania moderate and Vietnam veteran who picked up as many as 92 Democratic votes on the first vote.    The Treasury bill pending in the Senate reflects different but related pressures from the movement and people and commerce across borders in the Southwest. Arizona and New Mexico senators dominated the drafting of the measure, which provides $1.3 billion for the Customs Service, or $122 million more than the House-passed level. </TEXT></DOC>
