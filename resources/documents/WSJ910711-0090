Mulheren Jr., a prominent trader accused of aidingthe wrongdoing of Ivan F. Boesky.   The reversal marks the sixth major setback involvingwhite-collar crime cases in recent months for the U.S.attorney's office in Manhattan, which led the way in fightingalleged abuses on Wall Street in the 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mulheren had been convicted by a jury for allegedlymanipulating the stock price of Gulf andamp; Western IndustriesInc. at the behest of Mr. Boesky. The appeals court inManhattan said the government proved neither that themanipulation occurred nor even that Mr. Mulheren knew thatMr. Boesky would benefit from the trading. &quot;We are convincedthat no rational trier of fact could have found the elementsof the crimes charged here beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; thecourt wrote.   Defense attorneys said the recent string of reversalsrepresents a broad repudiation of the tactics employed inwhite-collar prosecutions by former U.S. Attorney RudolphGiuliani, who resigned in 1989 to pursue a political career.While conceding that Mr. Giuliani made importantcontributions by winning guilty pleas from some prominentbusiness world figures -- such as Mr. Boesky -- they said hisoffice overreached in other cases.   &quot;During Giuliani's administration, shortcuts were takenwhich now are leading to reversals in many of these cases,&quot;said Gerald Lefcourt, who represented one of the defendantsin the Princeton/Newport L.P. fraud and racketeering case.The racketeering convictions and most of the fraudconvictions in that case were overturned on appeal.   Mr. Giuliani, now in private practice at the New York firmof Anderson Kill Olick andamp; Oshinsky, responded that he is beingblamed for problems in the cases that were beyond hiscontrol, such as errors by trial judges and by prosecutorsduring trial. &quot;If a case is reversed because a judgeincorrectly instructed the jury, how could the U.S. attorneywho wasn't there at the time be responsible?&quot; he said.   Whatever the verdict on Mr. Giuliani's tenure, the recentdecisions reversing convictions by his office appear likelyto rein in prosecutors in the area of securities laws.Attorneys said they expect the decisions by the U.S. SecondCircuit Court of Appeals -- considered the nation's mostinfluential court on securities law -- to result in morecautious prosecutions and to put more of an onus on theSecurities and Exchange Commission to enforce securitieslaws. Unlike the U.S. attorney's office, the SEC brings civilcases, not criminal cases, though often involving the same orsimilar allegations.   &quot;There has been some concern about the heavycriminalization of the securities area,&quot; said defenseattorney Harvey Pitt, who formerly represented Mr. Boesky.&quot;The court seems to be saying that it is fine to criminalizea securities practice, or malpractice, but the prosecutorwill be held to a meticulous standard of proof. . . . It isless of a rebuke to {Mr.} Giuliani than it is a message toexisting prosecutors to put their cases together morecarefully.&quot;   In the Mulheren case, the court's reversal rested in largepart on its evaluation of the facts as they emerged in thetrial. After receiving a phone call from Mr. Boesky on Oct.17, 1985, Mr. Mulheren bought 75,000 shares of Gulf andamp;Western, now known as Paramount Communications Inc., whichpushed the closing price to $45 a share. Gulf andamp; Western hadagreed to buy back Mr. Boesky's huge Gulf andamp; Western stake ifthat closing price was reached.   Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Boesky's statement that &quot;itwould be great if it {Gulf andamp; Western} traded at 45,&quot; and Mr.Mulheren's response, &quot;I understand,&quot; constituted an agreementto manipulate the stock.   But the appeals court said, &quot;The meaning of this crypticconversation is, at best, ambiguous, and we reject thegovernment's contention that this conversation clearlyconveyed {Mr.} Boesky's request that the price of the stockbe pushed up to $45.&quot;   The appeals court, in a decision written by Judge JosephMcLaughlin, said it was puzzled that the government didn'task Mr. Boesky -- who testified in the case -- what he meantby his comments.   Thomas Puccio, an attorney for Mr. Mulheren at Milbank,Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy, said the former stock trader was&quot;elated&quot; at the news of the reversal. Mr. Puccio said heexpects that the SEC's suspension of Mr. Mulheren from thesecurities industry, which was conditioned on a criminalconviction, also will be lifted now that the conviction hasbeen overturned.   &quot;He's been through hell, but he's come out with his headheld high,&quot; Mr. Puccio said. He said Mr. Mulheren wouldn'tcomment.   Mr. Puccio said the Mulheren verdict was another exampleof how the &quot;government has problems with this second wave ofsecurities prosecutions,&quot; following the major cases againstinvestment banker Dennis Levine and Mr. Boesky. &quot;There's noquestion that these {later} cases weren't well thought out.&quot;   Mr. Mulheren can't be tried again on the one conspiracyand three fraud counts on which he was convicted, and whichthe appeals court reversed. But a new trial could be orderedon other counts on which a mistrial was declared when thejury last year couldn't reach a verdict on them.   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattandeclined to comment on the appeals court decision. She saidno decision has been made on whether to retry the case on theother charges.   In most of the recent high-profile reversals, the appealscourt based its decisions on procedural or legal errors bythe trial judge, although some of the reversals reflected onprosecutors' performance at trial as well.   In the Princeton/Newport case, the appeals court said thetrial judge deprived the defendants of a fair trial by notallowing them to show that they believed the tax transactionsinvolved were legitimate. The court said no crime could havebeen committed if the defendants didn't have criminal intent,which was never proved. The court also suggested thatprosecutors should reconsider whether a racketeering caseshould be brought in a case involving complicated taxtransactions.   In the political-corruption case of E. Robert Wallach, aformer adviser to former Attorney General Edwin Meese, theappeals court overturned the convictions because one of theprosecution's main witnesses perjured himself on the stand,and the court said prosecutors should have known. A relatedcase in the Wedtech Corp. political-corruption scandal alsowas reversed.   Only in the case against Robert Chestman, a formerstockbroker convicted of insider trading, did the appealscourt make a broad ruling on how securities law should beapplied. In reversing Mr. Chestman's conviction last year,the appeals court said insider trading doesn't occur unlessthe recipient of a stock tip is explicitly told that theinformation is confidential. In an unusual step, the entireappeals court agreed to review that decision at the requestof the U.S. attorney's office and the SEC. A decision isstill pending.   The appellate judges in the Mulheren case, while focusingon the factual allegations, noted that, &quot;We harbor doubtabout the government's theory of prosecution.&quot; But because itfound that the government hadn't proved its case, the courtdidn't decide the larger question of whether the law applied.   Prof. John Coffee, of Columbia University School of Law,said the reversal in the Mulheren case &quot;is a stricter andsomewhat harsher repudiation&quot; for prosecutors than the otherrecent setbacks. Prof. Coffee also noted that fewer than 10%of criminal convictions in the Second Circuit are overturned.&quot;That pattern {of recent reversals} is without precedent inthe Second Circuit,&quot; he said.   Mr. Giuliani, however, said that while he was U.S.attorney his office was rarely reversed.   He also said that defense attorneys are eager to criticizehis work because he was willing to tackle high-profilesecurities cases that were at the heart of theinsider-trading and stock-manipulation scandals on WallStreet. Giuliani-led prosecutions resulted in guilty pleas byDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its former junk-bond chief,Michael Milken, for trading-related crimes. &quot;I have littledoubt that a lot of it came from resentment over the casesagainst Boesky, Levine and Drexel and Milken. . . . They arereaching out for ways to criticize me,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said.</TEXT></DOC>
