Danny Wall are ``just the beginning'' of hisinvestigation of the Sandamp;L crisis.   Wall resigned just two weeks after the committee completed 50hours of hearings focusing on the regulator's handling of LincolnSavings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.   Lincoln is expected to become the nation's biggest Sandamp;L failure,expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.   ``This is just the beginning,'' Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas,said in a telephone interview Tuesday from his home in San Antonio.``We started with Lincoln because it's the prototype ... ofeverything that went wrong.''   Gonzalez said he may conduct more hearings on Lincoln and thepanel later would explore other Sandamp;L failures, including SilveradoBanking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver, Colo.   The Silverado case is politically sensitive because PresidentBush's son, Neil Bush, served on Silverado's board of directors.   Gonzalez said the committee will concentrate on theconstitutional question of how in 1988 Wall's agency, withoutspecific congressional authorization, was able to commit thegovernment to spending $40 billion on Sandamp;L rescues. The panel alsowill explore whether the FBI should have more vigorously pursuedshady Sandamp;L executives.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater avoided questions aboutwhether the president or his top aides wanted Wall to quit.   ``He resigned and it will be accepted,'' he said.   Under legislation enacted in August, the director of the thriftoffice serves a five-year term and must be confirmed by the Senate,which returns from holiday recess next month.   According to an industry source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, Treasury officials who oversee Wall's agency favorappointing an experienced regulator to succeed Wall. Earlyspeculation is centered on several officials who have worked foreither the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.   Neither Wall nor his immediate predecessor, Edwin Gray, hadregulatory experience. Wall had served as staff director of theSenate Banking Committee under Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah. Gray was aformer public relations executive and press secretary to RonaldReagan's 1980 campaign.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a member of the House Banking Committee,said the new thrift regulator ``has to be able to stand up topowerful interests within the industry, on Capitol Hill and,frankly, within the administration. ... He's got to be able toinspire public confidence.''   ``You need someone who does not come out of the politicalenvironment as Wall did. Rather, you need a tough, experiencedregulator who has a long history in banking regulation and knowsthe ins and outs of the industry,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,D-N.Y., also a banking panel member.   Wall, in a news conference announcing his resignation Monday,defended his record and said Gonzalez resorted to ``corruption ofthe truth and abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play.''   Gonzalez dismissed Wall's complaint Tuesday.   ``Down here in Texas ... we know that when a skunk is frightenedand retreating _ that is when he is spraying the hardest.''   The committee chairman also rejected complaints his intensecriticism of Wall had made it all but impossible for theadministration to find someone else willing step into the crossfire.   ``Watergate didn't deter people from running for thepresidency,'' he said.   Meanwhile, U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin inWashington was preparing to hear arguments Thursday in a lawsuitchallenging the federal takeover of Lincoln.   Among the witnesses subpoenaed are Charles H. Keating Jr.,chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent company.Leonard Bickwit, an attorney for American Continental, declinedTuesday to indicate whether Keating would testify or assert hisFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.   Keating is the subject of a federal grand jury probe in LosAngeles and the target of a $1.1 billion federal fraud andracketeering suit.   Among the 11 individual defendants in the fraud suit isKeating's brother, William J. Keating, a former two-term Republicanmember of Congress who is chief executive officer of the DetroitNewspaper Agency and chairman of the board of directors of TheAssociated Press.   William Keating is not accused of fraud or racketeering, but isnamed in three of 15 counts and is accused of negligence and breachof fiduciary duty.   William Keating, who served on the American Continental board,has said he attended only two board meetings. His lawyer, ChesterKamin, has said he was seeking to have William Keating's nameremoved from the government's suit.   William Keating on Tuesday declined to comment on the suit,saying, ``As long as this matter is in litigation, I'm not reallyable to discuss that.''</TEXT></DOC>
