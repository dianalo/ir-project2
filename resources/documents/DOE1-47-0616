For example boron does not have long lived radioisotopesbut seems to play a prominent role in the growing of plants. The authorshave studied techniques to measure the boron content in vegetable samplesand in solutions using the fact that the (n, {alpha}) cross section onboron is large and that the emitted alpha particle can be detected usingSSTND (solid state nuclear track detectors). Preliminary results arepresented and discussed to show the present limitations of this technique.</TEXT></DOC>
