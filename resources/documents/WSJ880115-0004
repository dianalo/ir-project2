The failing banks are Moran National Bank of Moran, Texas, with assets of about $16.8 million; Colonial Bank of New Orleans, with about $47.1 million in assets; and Balboa National Bank, National City, Calif., with assets of $25.6 million.    Moran National's sole office is to reopen today as a branch of Peoples State Bank, Clyde, Texas, which will assume its $15.9 million in deposits and purchase almost all of its assets from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. at a discount of $5.8 million.    Colonial Bank's two offices are scheduled to reopen today as branches of Pontchartrain State Bank, Metairie, La. Pontchartrain will assume Colonial's $47.4 million in deposits and will purchase $43.6 million of the failed bank's assets from the FDIC at a $1.5 million discount.    An FDIC spokesman said the agency would pay off insured depositors in Balboa National. It had $25.2 million of deposits in 3,700 accounts, including $75,000 exceeding the $100,000 insurance limit in 16 accounts. </TEXT></DOC>
