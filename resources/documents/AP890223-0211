Nicosia told The Associated Press he and other members of hisparty met for three hours Thursday with military officialsrepresenting Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who as chief of theDefense Forces is de facto ruler of Panama.   The officials guaranteed ``there will be pure elections in1989,'' said Nicosia, whose party identifies itself as politicallyindependent.   After the meeting, the president of the military commission, Lt.Col. Arnulfo Castrellon, told journalists ``Gen. Noriega hasconsented to talk to all the political parties to exchange opinionsin the interest of the country's progress.''   He said that if the Democratic Alliance, a coalition of theopposition Democratic Christian, Liberal and Liberal RepublicanNationalist Movement parties, is willing to talk, ``the doors willbe open to listen to all good Panamanians.''   The Alliance, which has Guillermo Endara, 52, as its presidentialcandidate, has refused to engage in pre-electoral talks with themilitary.   Panamanians on May 7 are to elect a president; two vicepresidents; 67 legislators and 510 local representatives.   The Defense Forces have said they will serve under whoever winsthe May presidential ballot. They make no secret, however, of theirsupport for presidential candidate Carlos Duque, who represents thegovernment-backed National Liberation Coalition.   The coalition is made up of eight parties that span the politicalspectrum.   Noriega has been Panama's de facto leader since February 1988,when he orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.The president had tried to fire Noriega as military leader afterNoriega was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug trafficking charges.Noriega denied the charges.   Washington continues to recognize Delvalle as president andimposed economic sanctions against Panama in an effort to forceNoriega out.
