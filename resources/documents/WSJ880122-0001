Sansweet (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> OXY </CO><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Armand Hammer showed the art world yesterday what he has repeatedly shown to a half dozen of his potential successors as chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.: He can change his mind abruptly and completely.    After promising for years that his extensive art collection would go to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, or LACMA, the 89-year-old executive sent shivers through the art community by announcing he plans to build his own $30 million &quot;Armand Hammer Museum and Cultural Center.&quot; Conveniently, the complex will replace a gas station just in back of Oxy's &quot;world headquarters&quot; at one of the busiest traffic intersections in the city.    The complex would open in May 1990, presumably in time for Dr. Hammer's 92nd birthday. His birthday is always celebrated at the annual shareholders' meeting, however, there is some question how much celebrating the shareholders will do when they find out they're paying for the 79,000 square-foot museum and center.    Dr. Hammer said Occidental will pay for the entire cultural complex. In fact, most of Dr. Hammer's art has been purchased over the years by a foundation that receives much of its money from the company. But the executive said the association of Oxy with the collection &quot;has provided significant public recognition to the corporation.&quot;    When asked why he had gone back on a longtime agreement to donate his collection to the county museum, Dr. Hammer said, &quot;It's impossible for LACMA to do justice to the collection.&quot; The museum already has a wing named after Dr. Hammer and his wife, Frances, and has long courted the couple.    Dr. Hammer valued his collection at $250 million, a figure that many art experts dispute. Some have said it might be worth as much as $150 million, but they concede that valuations are difficult in an era when single paintings at auction can go for $40 million or more.    The value of the collection is even murkier because of an obscure form filed with the Registry of Charitable Trusts of California. Most of the works in the collection, Dr. Hammer said, are owned by the Armand Hammer Foundation. But the Foundation's 1986 filing, the most recent available, list total assets of art on hand at $23.2 million.    The Foundation, which in 1986 received more than one-third of its total funding of nearly $4 million from Occidental, has exhibited the collection in the U.S. and overseas for 20 years -- often as a tool to cement business relationships for Occidental. When there was outcry in Tulsa over Occidental's acquisition of Cities Service Co., the collection came for a visit. When deals were in the works with Colombia or Mexico, the collection came along for the ride.    Plans for the museum must have been under way for a while, since an architectural model by New York architect Edward Larrabee Barnes was at Dr. Hammer's news conference. But Dr. Hammer declined to say when he changed his mind about donating his collection -- consisting of five centuries of European painting, a large collection of Honore Daumier lithographs, and the Leonardo da Vinci Codex Hammer.    Just last May, Dr. Hammer sent a letter to this newspaper criticizing a story that &quot;inaccurately characterized me as seeking a museum to bear my name.&quot; He added, &quot;I have never considered establishing a private museum of my own.&quot;    LACMA officials were shocked. The announcement &quot;comes as a surprise and a disappointment,&quot; a spokeswoman said. She noted that the museum has a 1980 agreement with Dr. Hammer stating his intention to bequeath his collection to the museum. But she added, &quot;It's not legally binding; it's more of a moral agreement.&quot;    Said one former Occidental employee, &quot;Dr. Hammer has a whim of iron.&quot;    Dr. Hammer's announcement followed a series of behind-the-scenes discussions with LACMA over questions such as whether other donors' names could be displayed in the Hammer building, whether his paintings could ever be sold, and whether works from the Hammer collection would be the only ones allowed in the Hammer wing's upper floor.    Daniel N. Belin, president of the LACMA board of trustees, said Dr. Hammer took particular umbrage at a letter he sent the executive last fall. Attempts were made to resolve differences, but they weren't successful. &quot;It came down to his view that all of these works could be shown in a setting that was more consistent with his wishes,&quot; Mr. Belin said.    Dr. Hammer's change of heart doesn't affect an agreement he has with the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The museum currently has on display 40 drawings and watercolors that Dr. Hammer has said he plans to bequeath to it.    John Walker, director emeritus of the National Gallery and a longtime art adviser to Dr. Hammer, was at the executive's side at the news conference yesterday. He said he supported the plan to divert the collection from the county museum because &quot;large museums bewilder&quot; people, and the addition of the Hammer collection would make LACMA &quot;still more confusing.&quot;    The museum will be at Wilshire and Westwood boulevards in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, which often rates as the busiest traffic intersection in the city. A model of the structure looks like a flat pizza box with two open matchbook covers on top; they cover the open courtyard.    Westwood has been the battleground for Los Angeles's burgeoning slow-growth movement. But Dr. Hammer said he had received &quot;unanimous approval&quot; from community leaders and he was supported at the news conference by the area's city councilman, Zev Yaroslavsky, a slow-growth advocate who is expected to run for mayor. </TEXT></DOC>
