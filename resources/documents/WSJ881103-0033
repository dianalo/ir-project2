In an earlier Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Rosewood said it had acquired a 6.2% stake and &quot;might propose taking the company private.&quot; Rosewood also said it &quot;might seek representation on the board&quot; of First Executive, a Los Angeles insurance holding company.    According to the latest filing, representatives of the group met with First Executive's chairman, Fred Carr, &quot;to discuss strategies for enhancing shareholder value&quot; but didn't make any specific proposals. The group said it may seek additional meetings.    The filing didn't indicate the date of the meeting and Mr. Carr declined to comment. First Executive did report that third-quarter net income climbed 12% and said Mr. Carr plans to recommend that the board declare a 5% stock dividend.    Under state insurance laws, Rosewood couldn't acquire more than a 9.9% stake in the company without regulatory approval.    Analysts have speculated that the purchase of an increased stake by Rosewood might speed up efforts by Mr. Carr or outside investors to put together a similar transaction to go private. The company's stock has climbed recently on rumors of a takeover or leveraged buy-out offer. Mr. Carr declined to comment on the rumors or on whether he has considered making a leveraged buy-out offer.    First Executive closed yesterday at $16.125, down 37.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.    The group said it holds 7,008,600 First Executive common shares, including 1,287,500 shares bought from Sept. 14 to Oct. 31 for $14.81 to $15.56 each.    Rosewood Financial is controlled by the Caroline Hunt trust and Mark W. Hobbs, Rosewood Financial's president. It is a unit of Rosewood Corp., a holding company that includes real estate, ranching, oil and gas and hotel businesses. A spokesman for Rosewood said the Dallas-based company had no comment on the filing.    Separately, First Executive reported third-quarter net income was $52.6 million, or 52 cents a share, up from $46.8 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
