In principle,this argument should carry even greater weight in conjunction with nuclearenergy. The major draw back of dedicated heating reactors as seen upto now concerns the high specific capital cost for the application-dictatedsmall reactor size. The paper discusses by way of a specific examplein what directions solutions are being sought.</TEXT></DOC>
