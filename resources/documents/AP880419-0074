Pose the question ``why'' to a Democratic member of thatall-white group, and you'll get a look as though you asked why itdoesn't snow here in July.   It's not group racism, lawmakers and analysts say. It'spractical politics.   ``A member of Congress has to look at it and see what's in itfor him,'' says Charles Cook, a columnist and observer of internalcongressional politics.   Senate Democrats send 43 delegates to the party's nationalconvention in Atlanta. They are among the so-called superdelegates, who serve by virtue of their positions as party leadersor elected officials.   Of the 32 delegates picked in the Senate so far, Michael Dukakishas nine; Sen. Albert Gore has five; Sen. Paul Simon, whomothballed his campaign, has two, and 16 are uncommitted.   Although Jackson is second in the overall delegate race toDukakis, he has zero. It can be a sensitive topic.   Incumbent senators take a hard-nosed view of Jackson's chancesof actually becoming president. Backing a losing ticket would be ofno help to their own re-election chances _ or for the Democratsretaining control of the Senate.   ``There's a strong feeling that we've got to elect apresident,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who is committed toDukakis.   ``We need to do all we can to come up with the best possibleslate,'' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. He's uncommitted, but says``Dukakis has certainly shown he has support. That has to be amajor factor.''   Thomas Mann, who studies government at the BrookingsInstitution, says some senators may have concluded that Jackson``has the capacity to excite blocs of voters in primaries but he'dhave an extremely difficult time being elected in a generalelection.''   ``I think you'd find any number of members of the House andSenate embrace another black candidate,'' Mann said, mentioning asan example an elected public official such as Rep. William H. GrayIII, D-Pa. Gray is supporting Jackson.   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., who beat a Republican incumbent twoyears ago with the help of strong black support, is among theuncommitted.   ``I haven't sensed any (racial) prejudice,'' Fowler said,pointing out the large number of uncommitteds. ``The whole conceptof super delegates is if the public has not made up their minds,then we come into play,'' he said.   ``I think most senators want this situation to go away. It's achoice they don't want to make,'' said Cook.   ``It's a choice between the people you want to keep in your campand the people you need to get in your camp to win. The Jewishcommunity ... was very much alienated by Jackson's remarks in thepast.''   Mann said the senators are ``caught both ways.''   ``They could be hurt politically by being prominently associatedwith any kind of a stop Jackson movement,'' he said.   The hope for senators is that the public will make a candidatethe inevitable nominee soon so the super delegates can simplyratify the popular choice.   With few primaries left, a big win for Dukakis in today's NewYork contest could lead many senators to conclude that the publicchoice has been made.   ``I think if Dukakis manages to win ... the political conditionswill be created for the vast bulk of super delegates to end up inthe Dukakis camp in time for a first-ballot victory,'' said Mann.   ``If he wins the primary by a significant margin, it's allover,'' said Baucus.   What if Jackson surprises Dukakis in New York?   ``They're going to keep their powder dry certainly until theconvention,'' Mann said.   --- EDITOR'S NOTE _ Steven Komarow covers politics in Congressfor the Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
