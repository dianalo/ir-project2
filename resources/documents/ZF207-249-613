 Today, right off the shelf, you can buy a memorychip with a million transistors linked by tiny wires just 1 micron wide, or amillionth of a meter.andM;But an electron zipping down a 1-micron wire is like a single car zoomingalong an interstate highway--an incredible waste of space on an alreadycrowded chip.andP;  The super-fast electrical devices of the future will bepowered by chips holding 200 million transistors, linked by connections justone-fifth of a micron wide--the equivalent of a narrow country road.andM;This feat may demand more than today's technology can deliver.andP;  Within thenext 20 years, chips based on current technologies will bump up againstphysical barriers.andP;  As the number of transistors grows, overpacked chips willbegin to choke themselves on heat and electron interference in a microscopictraffic jam.andM;In an effort to avoid this fate, scientists are turning to new materials toreplace silicon and gallium arsenide, the current chip materials of choice.andO;And researchers are beginning to examine the potential of superconductors andlightwave technology.andM;Shedding Some Light on OpticsandM;All chips in use today depend on electrons to transmit their information, butelectrons carry a charge that can cause them to interfere with one another.andO;&quot;If you have 100 wires close together and 99 are carrying electronic pulses,the one inactive wire will pick up some of the signals,&quot; explains ThomasCathey, director of the Optoelectronic Computing Systems Center, located inBoulder, Colorado.andM;Instead of relying on electrons, optical computing chips will use particlesof light, or photons, to transmit information.andP;  Photons don't carry a chargeand don't react with neighboring particles.andP;  They can even pass through eachother without interference.andP;  Lightwave technology relies mainly on fiberoptics, but optical computing chips will send free-standing light wavesthrough the air.andM;Chips based on optical transmission should be able to overcome some of thelimitations of electronic semiconductors.andP;  As chip makers pack more and moreelectronic devices onto smaller and smaller chips, they need more and morewiring to connect them.andP;  Current technologies limit the number of such wires,or interconnections, to about 200 to 300 per chip.andP;  Scientists estimate thatan optical computing chip could handle up to 10,000 interconnections.andM;Light particles also generate less heat than do their electroniccounterparts, so optical chip designers are able to pack transistors evenmore tightly on a clip without affecting the performance of neighboringdevices.andM;Increasing the number of interconnections on a chip will have littleimmediate impact on personal computers, but it promises to smooth developmentof parallel processing in complex systems such as supercomputers.andP;  Parallelprocessing speeds computing by allowing many processors to work on differentparts of a problem at the same time.andP;  That means the chips must be inconstant contact to work efficiently, which requires a massive number ofinterconnections.andP;  Optical technology will make it easier to build computersthat can handle those links.andM;Similarly, the interconnective abilities of optical chips could have asignificant impact on neural networking, a computer architecture thatattempts to mimic the organization of neurons in the human brain.andP;  Eventhough each neuron in the brain can fire only a few times a second--farslower than an electronic device--each brain cell is associated, orinterconnected, with thousands of other neurons.andP;  This permits theserelatively slow cells to rapidly perform highly complex tasks such as patternrecognition, the basis for sight.andM;The brain can perform 10.sup.17 interconnections per second, while an opticalsystem theoretically could handle 10.sup.18., according to John Caulfield,director of the Center for Applied Optics at the University of Alabama inHuntsville.andP;  &quot;I can't imaging an electronic computer that could do more than10.sup.12 interconnections per second,&quot; he says.andP;  The additional power of anoptical system should help computers recognize complex patterns such as humanfaces.andM;Unlike electronic circuits, optical computing chips are also relativelyimmune to the powerful electromagnetic pulses and radiation produced bynuclear explosions.andP;  This makes them well suited for defense applications,especially in the Strategic Defense Initiative, which may require equipmentthat can operate after a nuclear blast.andM;Although the theoretical benefits of optical computing are clear, thetechnology will probably be introduced gradually.andP;  The first generation ofoptical chips will be optical-electronic hybrids, most likely consisting ofsilicon or gallium arsenide, that will communicate with the rest of thecomputer via light beams sent through tiny lenses, lasers, and mirrorsinstead of electrons traveling through wires, according to Alan Huang, headof the optical computing research department at ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories inHolmdel, New Jersey.andP;  These chips should process information about 1,000times as fast as purely electronic chips.andM;The second generation will attack the bottleneck of electrons inside thechip, not just between chips, creating a completely optical integratedcircuit.andP;  Huang speculates that optical logic gates, the thinking part of achip, could boost processing speed another 100 times.andM;Communications companies already familiar with fiber optics are leading thepush into optical clip research, along with supercomputer manufacturers andthe Department of Defense.andP;  Within a few months, Huang hopes to create anoptical chip smart enough to control a washing machine.andM;Superfast ChipsandM;Before abandoning electrons entirely, however, chip makers are looking intothe possibility of using superconducting materials to build more powerfulchips.andP;  Superconducting materials offer negligible resistance to electriccurrents, leading to faster and more sensitive electronic components.andM;In a recent chip race in Japan, a superconductor device proved more than tentimes as fast as its gallium arsenide competitor, according to Theodore VanDuzer, an electrical engineering and computer sciences professor at theUniversity of California in Berkeley.andM;Instead of transistors, superconducting chips use Josephson tunnel junctions,superconducting switches that are substantially faster than conventionalcircuits.andP;  Josephson junctions also require less energy and generate lessheat, allowing manufacturers to pack chips more densely.andP;  Increased densitytranslates into more speed.andM;Currently, several companies, including TRW and Biomagnetic Technologies, aredeveloping superconducting chip products using niobium alloys.andO;Niobyium-based superconductors work only when cooled to cryogenictemperatures.andP;  That kind of cooling requires liquid helium, which can existonly at temperatures lower than -450 degrees Fahrenheit.andM;One of the first companies to offer commercial superconducting products,Hypres, Inc., of Elmsford, New York, uses a superconducting chip to make anoscilloscope said to be 50 times as sensitive as any other available.andM;Chemical MemoryandM;Today's Microelectronic bottlenecks involve chip density and speed.andP;  But asoptics and superconductors begin to solve those problems, experts predict anew bottleneck, in data access and storage.andP;  Chemical chips, using materialswith a tighter molecular structure than silicon or gallium arsenide, may bethe answer.andM;While the information-bearing structures in a good silicon chip can storeabout 100 megabits per square inch, certain chemical structures couldtheoretically hold up to 250,000 megabits in that same space, according toRichard Zech, president of Zech Tech International of San Mateo, California,which is researching the possibilities of high-density chemical memory.andM;Certain chemical compounds known as stereo-isomers change configurations andproperties when exposed to certain stimuli.andP;  A stereo-isomer that reacts tolight could function as a binary switch, shifting from one configuration toanother when lit by a laser, much as charges alternate on today's chips.andO;Optical computing chips would be used to manage the memory.andM;Chemical memory is probably still about 20 years away.andP;  &quot;There are lots ofchallenges in making this practical,&quot; Zech says.andP;  &quot;But there are[appropriate] materials in nature, like those in phosphorescent livingorganisms that react to light.&quot;andM;The organic nature of these compounds raises some interesting issues.andO;Chemical memory chips might actually decay, so how would you back them up?andO;If they are alive, how would you feed them?andP;  And what happens if they getsick and throw up all your data?andM;A Sense of SmellandM;Another unusual approach would create super-small chemical chips that conductelectricity only in the presence of certain substances.andP;  These so-calledmolecule-based chips are under development at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology in Cambridge.andP;  Because they depend on a chemical reaction, thesedevices are too slow to be of much use in computers, but they may findgainful employment as chemical sensors detecting toxic fumes or diagnosingillnesses, says Mark Wrighton, chairman of MIT's chemistry department.andM;Wrighton's molecule-based sensors are actually transistors, consisting ofmetal contacts separated by a polymer, one of a special class of chemicalsthat includes plastics.andP;  Eventually, molecule-based sensors would beminiaturized still further, perhaps to the width of a single molecule.andM;Under normal conditions the transistor remains in the &quot;off&quot; phase, but in thepresence of certain chemicals--a toxic gas, for example--the polymer becomesa conductor, completing the circuit and switching the transistor on.andO;Wrighton is searching for polymers that will respond to different chemicalsin the environment.andM;So far, MIT has developed a molecule-based transistor that responds to watervapor, and Wrighton says his lab now can design a device that detects commongases such as oxygen and hydrogen.andP;  Other versions might detect chemicalsdissolved in fluid; a major potential use would be blood analysis.andM;These new chip technologies may seem a bit pie-in-the-sky.andP;  But the physicalbarriers looming over today's chip technology means that, at some point,radical new approaches will be essential to achieving further increases incomputing speed and power.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
