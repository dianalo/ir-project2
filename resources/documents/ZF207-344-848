Cassity Jr., director for command, controland communications of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a new Computer SystemsDivision soon will take over management of Air Force computer acquisitions.andM;Cassity, former head of AFCAC, and other Air Force officials said most of theservice's current procurements are for systems integration or standardizationprojects.andP;  Future Air Force puchases will emphasize open architectureportable software and upgrades to the Integrated Services Digital Network,officials said.andM;Several major procurements, such as the $1 billion Desktop III microcomputer,will be used to establish standards for future systems, they said.andM;The Air Force also is considering whether to develops systems to operate in&quot;a darkroom enviroment -- unmanned facilities in which computers will be leftalone to do their thing,&quot; Cassity said.andM;Col.andP;  Arlyn Schumaker, commander of the Standard Systems Center at Gunter AirForce Base, Ala., said the center is exploring the darkroom approach on &quot;aconcept basis.&quot;andP;  Formal testing of the concept will begin at Gunter thisfall, he said.andM;To date, all the work has been very conceptual with no real or definite plansformulated beyond the proof of concept, he said.andM;&quot;Our target date is sometime before the year 2000,&quot; Schumaker said.andP;  Thedarkroom would be the central piece in an open system architecture that alsowould embrace completely portable software, he said.andM;Gunter now houses the service's Software Center of Excellence, where by1992-93, he said, &quot;We hope to have a software environment that is totallyindependent of the target hardware, that can be developed on a suite ofhardware and ported to other potential systems.&quot;andM;Storage Problems?andM;He said he believes the concept is technologically feasible but may be toocostly.andP;  Converting to such a system will require more disk space and/orrobotic tape servers.andP;  Video storage eventually might reduce the need forpersonnel to attend computers.andM;Schumaker said the Standard Systems Center is an appropriate location to testthe concept.andP;  &quot;I've got 15 to 18 computers I can use, and if we can't affordit on the larger systems, we won't be able to do it on the smaller ones,&quot; hesaid.andM;In related matters, Cassity said the Air Force's newly formed ComputerSystems Division (CSD) will begin operations in July at Gunter.andM;Schumaker said CSD will &quot;provide central management and direction for allcommunications and computer acquisitions.&quot;andP;  Several of the 150 vendors at theconference asked where AFCAC's current acquistions authority will end andCSD's new one will begin.andM;Schumaker said officials have not decided how to divide the responsibilitybetween the two organizations.andP;  An AFCAC representative told the conferencethe command based at Hanscomb Air Force Base, Mass., still will be active incomputer buys.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
