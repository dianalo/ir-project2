<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-0633 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computer program capable of simulating two-phase multiple tube-row thermosiphonloop heat exchanger systems is described. The evaporator and condensercoils must be of a single-pass, straight-tube configuration. The loopmay have any specified thermal boundary conditions and any geometricorientation subject to the limitation that the condensate must be capableof returning to the evaporator liquid header by gravity. A comparisonbetween simulated and experimental performance results is also presentedfor two different systems. One system involved water-jacketed evaporatorand condenser tubes. The second system utilized air-to-air finned-tubeevaporator and condenser coils. The simulated performance for each ofthe systems was found to be in good agreement with the experimentallymeasured values. In both of these studies the working fluid was R-11.</TEXT></DOC>
