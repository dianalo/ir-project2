Smedley, senior vice president of MotorolaInc. and general manager of the Radio-Telephone Systems Group.andM;&quot;Ungermann-Bass is the premier supplier of enterprise network solutions.andO;Their experience in sophisticated customer premises networking, combined withMotorola's expertise in radio system communications, will be a key factor inwireless and wire network integration,&quot; added Smedley.andM;&quot;Wireless communications represent a powerful new dimension in networking,&quot;said Ralph Ungermann, president of Ungermann-Bass Inc.andM;&quot;It has great potential for use in historical building, leased facilities andretail environments where wireless technology complements the existing wiringsolution.andP;  More importantly, it is well poised for future connectivitydemands made by the entry of palmtop and portable computers.&quot;andM;Altair wireless Ethernet products either replace or extend the reach of wiresand cables that connect data devices in a 10Mbps (Megabit per second)Ethernet LAN, providing untethered flexibility.andM;Ungermann-Bass' Access/One is a smart wiring hub which uses standardtelephone wire to connect end-user devices such as PCs, Macintosh systems,terminals, minis and mainframes and integrates them into an Ethernet, tokenring, broadband or Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) backbone network.andM;Alan P. Zabarsky, general manager of Motorola's Altair Product Operationssaid, &quot;That two major vendors in the wiring and wireless domains are workingtogether to unify the best of both offerings is a milestone event.andP;  Customerscan now have the ultimate in network sophistication and flexibility.&quot;andM;Added Michael S. Gardner, Ungermann-Bass' vice president of sales andmarketing, &quot;With the manageability that Access/One can provide as the linkbetween Altair and the network, customer will have a centrally managedenterprise network that extends to all potential users.andM;&quot;To realize this capability, our companies are taking a leadership role indefining and accelerating the acceptance of industry standard SNMP managementcapabilities.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
