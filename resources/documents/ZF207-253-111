(The YearAhead)andM;</TITLE><SUMMARY>Major government computer systems are sometimes designated'Presidential Priority Systems' in the president's annualManagement Report.andP;  These systems are noted for their size, cost,technical leadership or impact on government operations.andP;  Updatesare given on the status of most of the systems so designated.andO;Many of these systems are still in their earliest stages.andP;  Thesystems involve almost every department and agency in the federalgovernment, including the State Department, the CommerceDepartment, the Internal Revenue Service and the NuclearRegulatory Commission.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     System DevelopmentOffice AutomationGovernment AgencyNational GovernmentPreview of Coming Year.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>'Presidential Priority Systems' Have a Full SlateandM;Foreign Affairs SystemandM;The State Department once again has extended the deadline for responses toits $600 million ADP Distributed Systems request for proposals.andP;  Thedepartment plans to issue and 11-year, indefinite-delivery,in-definite-quantity contract that will satisfy the department's worldwideADP needs into the next century.andP;  The system acquired will be a platform forimplementing the Foreign Affairs Information System (FAIS).andM;State extended the deadline to March 1 to allow time to answer 450 questionsthat vendors have asked about the RFP, said contracting officer Walter R.andO;Cate Jr.andP;  Officials said they did not know when they might award a contract.andM;The contract will follow a major automation contract awarded to WangLaboratories Inc.andP;  in 1979.andP;  The department first sought to upgrade itssystems in 1986 but was forced to withdraw and rewrite the RFP after IBMCorp. and Digital Equipment Corp. protested what they saw as bias towardWang.andM;The rewritten RFP asks for general-purpose Tempest and non-Tempest desktopcomputers and minicomputers, as well as software, support services,maintenance and training.andP;  State's packet-switched tele-communicationsnetwork, known as DOSTN, is being handled through a separate procurement.andM;Agencies within State and some others will be able to order through the FAIScontract to support a wide range of consular activities, administrativefunctions, office automation needs, inventory and scheduling tasks.andM;Advanced Weather SystemandM;The Commerce Department last month made an $11 million down payment on whatcould turn out to be a $600 million program to provide early warnings oftornadoes and floods and to improve weather forecasting in general.andM;Two contractors will split the $11 million to build competing prototypes ofthe Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System for the 1990s (AWIPS-90)over the next 21 months.andP;  Planning Research Corp. of McLean, Va., wasauthorized to spend $5 million, and Computer Sciences Corp., El Segundo,Calif., got $5.9 million.andM;AWIPS-90 will link weather observation systems and 113 weather reporting andanalysis installations.andP;  Weather information generated by satellites, radar,visual observation and other measuring devices will be forwarded to fieldoffices for fast analysis, said Nolan Miller, chief of the National WeatherService's AWIPS technical branch.andM;The contractor will own and operate AWIPS processing stations during the12-year contract, Miller said.andM;After Commerce chooses one of the two finalists' prototypes, the departmentwill allow two years for further development and testing at 10 sites.andP;  Itwill take another four years to deploy the system.andP;  It will be recompeted in2002.andM;Tax System RedesignandM;Internal Revenue Service officials and taxpayers know the existing IRS taxprocessing system is inefficient and outdated, but progress towardmodernization has been slow.andM;IRS officials have been working since 1982 to pick a final design for a newtax system.andP;  It will take 10 years to get a new system up and running, yetthe agency has approved only a preliminary design.andM;However, IRS officials made slow but steady progress in 1988.andP;  Agencyofficials spent the year refining the planning process that will supportdevelopment of a new systems configuration and transition to using it, saidHenry H. Philcox, assistant commissioner for information systems development.andM;Efforts began in earnest to define more specifically the systems needed tosupport the IRS in the 1990s, Philcox said.andP;  By the end of fiscal 1989, theIRS will have developed an in-depth plan to attack the problem, he said.andM;IRS did so well in 1988 that the Tax System Redesign project is not just onschedule, it is ahead of schedule, Philcox said.andM;Licensing Support SystemandM;It will take 50 years to fill the nation's first nuclear waste repository onYucca Mountain in Nevada and another 100 centuries before those radioactivewastes no longer endanger people or the planet.andP;  Before the disposal site canbe used, an elaborate licensing process will take place to avert anyunforeseen problems or hidden defects in its selection, design and operation.andM;During the three-year licensing review scheduled to begin in 1995, NuclearRegulatory Commission members and staff will rely on the $200 millionLicensing Support System, a massive data system that by 1995 will hold some25 million pages of documents amounting to an automated encyclopedia ofinformation on nuclear waste disposal.andM;By 2003, when the Energy Department agency expects to start depositing wastesat Yucca Mountain, the LSS may hold 40 million pages of documents.andM;The modular system will include nine data capture stations at DOE's contractlaboratories and a central collection station at LSS headquarters at theUniversity of Nevada-Las Vegas.andP;  Local and wide area networks will link LSSusers and information providers with the LSS database.andP;  Some 475 accessworkstations will be spread around the country.andM;The information resources management office within Energy's Office ofCivilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) will plan, procure, install andimplement LSS, and the NRC will operate it.andM;Barbara A. Cerny, the OCRWM's IRM director, said she has completed thefoundation for preparing an LSS RFP, including creation of the first EnergyLAN.andP;  The next big move in the project will include finishing an LSS test bedprototype and starting procurement.andP;  The schedule calls for LSS to beoperational in 1992.andM;FAA Advanced Automation SystemandM;With the delays caused by its procurement protest behind it, the FederalAviation Administration has begun to work on the acquisition phase of its$3.5 billion Advanced Automation System.andM;The AAS is the centerpiece of the FAA's National Airspace Plan (NAS), whichconsists of more than 90 projects to modernize regulation and management ofthe nation's air traffice.andM;Under the 10-year AAS modernization contract, IBM Corp. will supply newhardware, software and controller workstations to automate some air trafficcontroller functions and allow more aircraft to fly more popular and morefuel-efficient routes.andM;When the FAA awarded the AAS contract to IBM on July 25, rival HughesAdvanced Systems Inc. protested, claiming IBM had received preferentialtreatment and had been allowed to bid used equipment, which meant IBM couldprice its bid below Hughes'.andM;The General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals suspended workon the contract while considering the protest, but it eventually threw theprotest out.andM;IBM began work Oct. 31 and will deliver the first replacement equipment in1990.andP;  &quot;The three-month delay should not hurt our schedule very much,&quot; saidMichael Perry, deputy director of the FFA's automation service.andP;  Thecontract's first big milestone will be &quot;the critical design review for thefull-blown system.andP;  That's scheduled for the end of 1989,&quot; he said.andM;Last June, as part of the AAS upgrade, the FFA replaced its aging IBM 9020host computers at its en route centers with new IBM 3083 computers.andP;  Theagency took two years to replace 20 old host computers.andM;Personnel Concept IIIandM;When the Air Force Personnel Concept III(PC-III) system is deployed thisfall, it will begin to eliminate about 8 million pieces of paper that land onAir Force desks each year.andP;  The system eventually will do the work of 1,537service employees.andM;A PC-III prototype will come on line in October at Mather Air Force Base inSacramento, Calif.andP;  Two months later, the first full system will be installedat RAndolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.andP;  An Air Force spokesmansaid 35 bases will receive PC-III equipment in fiscal 1990, 44 more willdeploy it in fiscal 1991, and another 47 bases will get the system in fiscal1992.andM;The program will support better and faster decisions on training,reassignments, promotions and awards.andP;  &quot;Actions that now take as long as 45days will be completed in less than five days,&quot; an Office of Management andBudget report said.andM;Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Robert H. Ludwig, the Air Force's assistant chief of staff forcommand, control, communications and computer systems, said PC-IIIperformance tests were scheduled to begin this month at the Air ForceMilitary Personnel Center in San Antonio.andM;Ludwig said PC-III will be one of the first programs to use the standardDefense Department minicomputers being acquired through the AFCAC 251 buy.andO;Air Force officials will act as their own prime contractors and handlesystems integration.andP;  They will seek contractors for software and any otherequipment needed.andM;FTS 2000andM;The Dec. 7 award of the FTS 2000 contracts for revamping federalcommunications may have concluded what has been not only the largest civiliangovernment procurement but also one of the most controversial.andM;The contract was split between ATandamp;T Co., which got a 60 percent share of theproject, and US Sprint Communications Co., which got the rest.andP;  The aggregatevalue of the 10-year pact could go as high as $25 billion, depending on howmuch use federal agencies make of the new long-distance telecommunicationssystem.andM;The procurement, conceived five years ago by the General ServicesAdministration, was delayed initially by an Office of Management and Budgetreview and later by the House Government Operations Committee, which forcedGSA to split the huge contract between two vendors.andM;Possibly the most serious threat to the procurement came in allegations thata GSA engineer may have leaked ATandamp;T bid information in connection with aseparate but related contract for switching equipment.andP;  The matter remainsunder investigation.andM;With the award to ATandamp;T and US Sprint, GSA officials promise astate-of-the-art digital network that will meet agency needs to transmitdata, image and video in addition to voice.andP;  The existing,quarter-century-old analog network carries mostly voice.andM;Logistics Systems ModernizationandM;Each year, the Defense Logistics Agency buys billions of dollars worth ofitems, ranging from pasta to spare parts for automobiles, on behalf of thearmed services.andP;  But sometimes the right hand doesn't know what the left handis doing.andM;The problem stems from a multitude of information systems that do notcommunicate adequately with each other or with systems used by the armedservices.andP;  &quot;We have about 17 information systems that don't easily shareinformation and don't interface well with the services,&quot; a program officialsaid.andM;This problem prompted the agency to begin the Logistics Systems ModernizationProgram (LSMP), a $2.8 billion effort to integrate, standardize and modernizesystems that support ordering, warehousing and delivering and accounting forsupplies.andP;  Late last year DLA issued a request for information, askingpotential contractors to comment on the agency's plans by this month.andM;Program officials view LSMP as essentially a communications project to allowmore data sharing.andP;  Marshall Bailey, a DLA acquisition management specialist,said the contractor will provide a global architecture for DLA and the restof DOD, a plan for moving to the proposed architecture and a plan formanaging it.andM;Based on those plans, the contractor will design a series of large-scaleprojects over a 10-year period.andP;  The first project will be to design adatabase containing information on vendors who sell to DLA.andM;SSA Systems ModernizationandM;Though it seems to be taking shots along the way, the Social SecurityAdministration's Systems Modernization Plan continues along its uphill trail.andM;A recent General Accounting Office report again criticized the modernizationeffort as being behind schedule and called for SSA to improve its planningprocedures.andP;  In particular, the report called for the agency to coordinateits long-term Systems Administration Plan better with near-term upgrades ofits computer systems.andM;Meanwhile, a recent House Government Operations Committee Report called forthe agency to halt its modernization effort and for the General ServicesAdministration to suspend its procurement authority.andP;  In addition, SSACommissioner Dorcas Hardy recently warned agency employees that budgetshortfalls could slow modernization plans.andM;An agency spokesman said the agency's ADP plans for 1989 would not beaffected by the shortfall.andM;In 1982, SSA began its $479 million, five-year effort to modernize itsobsolete and hard-to-maintain computer systems by improving software,equipment and telecommunications and by installing an integrated database.andM;The agency has made gains in the modernization effort but still lackssoftware for processing Supplemental Security Income claims and forprocessing post-entitlement changes in data on regular Social Securityrecipients.andP;  These improvements are to begin by 1990.andM;&quot;As far as we're concerned, the SMP has been successful, and we don't acceptat all any description otherwise,&quot; an agency spokesman said.andP;  &quot;We don't agreewith the House Government Operations Committee report.andP;  However, we do agreewith the GAO report, and we are currently defining our plans to bridge ourlong-range goals with our short-range ones.&quot;andM;ERISA Information SystemandM;Labor Department officials are working to meet the July 1989 target date forbringing a large database on line to improve enforcement of the EmployeeRetirement and Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974.andM;The database is part of the ERISA, Information System (EIS), which willreplace the existing Employee Plan Master File (EPMF) processing system thedepartment has been using since the mid-1970s.andM;Under the law, more than 900,000 pension and employee benefit plans withcombined assets of more than $1 trillion file detailed reports with the LaborDepartment, the Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies.andM;Enforcement agents of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration reviewtransactions carried out by the fund managers.andP;  In one year, the agentsordered the funds to reverse $100 million worth of transactions that were notin the best interests of plan beneficiaries.andP;  The new system could help getthat figure to over $300 million, the Labor Department estimated.andM;IRS, whose 5500 forms are used to report the information under a cooperativeeffort with the Labor Department, is enhancing an existing system to improveprocessing of the forms.andM;Treasury System 90andM;The Treasury Department is about ready to issue a request for proposals toupgrade and expand a system that already pays out more than $900 billion ayear to more than 137 million people.andM;Treasury officials said the RFP for the Financial Management Service's System90 will be issued soon and they plan to award a contract by November.andM;Designated as a Presidential Priority System last year, System 90 willsupport payments, claims, reclamations, cash management, agency accountingand credit administration.andM;Those who currently rely on FMS for payments include 39 million SocialSecurity beneficiaries, 90 million households receiving tax refund payments,4.4 million veterans or their dependents and 4.2 people receivingSupplemental Security Income payments.andM;The administration expects System 90 to save the government $14 millionthrough operational and cash management savings.andP;  It also should enable FMSto handle a workload that is increasing at a rate of about 10 millionpayments per year.andM;System 90's redesigned claims-processing feature is expected to eliminate$9.5 million from an annual $50 million loss due to theft and fraudulentclaims, reduce the claims-processing time for benefit payment problems from45 days to seven days or less, and enable agencies to issue stop-paymentrequests electronically.andM;Agriculture Loan Pilot ProgramandM;Farmers Home Administration officials determined last year that collectingpayments and otherwise serving rural housing loans would be less expensive ifkept in house, instead of contracted out.andM;The Agriculture Department agency makes housing, farming, business andindustry loans and grants in rural areas.andM;Agency officials had hoped tht the cost of servicing the loans could be cutby contracting out, but a pilot program involving 32,500 mortgages in SouthCarolina suggested that contracting out would double servicing costs, whilecollections would not improve substantially.andM;FmHA's planning and analysis staff recommended the pilot should not beexpanded in its current form.andM;They now plan to look at setting up centralized state collection andcorrespondence systems, which would entail upgraded ADP installations.andM;Automated Patent SystemandM;&quot;If at first you don't succeed, try again,&quot; could be the motto of Patent andTrademark Office officials who saw PTO's Automated Patent System (APS)program come dangerously close to being stalled indefinitely, said Thomas P.andO;Giammo, PTO's assistant commissioner for information systems.andM;The pioneering system will search and retrieve patent filings and willmaintain the information in both text and image form.andP;  After false starts anddelays, the Commerce Department, PTO's parent agency, convened a prestigiousindustry panel to review plans for the system last year.andM;The panel concluded APS was necessary, and endorsed PTO's overall approach,Giammo said.andM;But program management by PTO officials, the terms of the contract withPlanning Research Corp. of McLean, Va., and technical requirements had to berevamped before PTO could move ahead with a production test bedimplementation.andM;PTO was to begin deploying APS last summer, but the restructuring has delayedinstallation until 1991, Giammo said.andM;In November, Commerce Secretary William C. Verity Jr.andP;  attended a ceremonycommemorating completion of a stability test of the production test bed.andO;Verity was supposed to take part in a brief demonstration, &quot;but he was soimpressed with the system, he sat there and used it for half an hour,&quot; Giammosaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
