In Armonk, N.Y., an IBM spokesman declined to comment. Butthe industry executives said they expect the tougherperformance guidelines to be announced internally this week.</LP><TEXT>   The executives added that they expect IBM to cut at leasta few thousand more jobs next year through the program. IBMhas already said its world-wide work force will decline by atleast 17,000 this year, to 357,000, but earnings have beenweak all year, and IBM is widely expected to continueshrinking itself.   Under the new guidelines, IBM will more strictly enforce asystem under which it ranks employees on a numerical scale.Few employees now carry a rank below three, but theguidelines will force managers to rank people as fours.Anyone with a rank that low will face pressure to resign, andquickly.   In the past, when a weak employee was given a checklistfor improving his performance and was given a certaindeadline, he was said to be on &quot;a measured mile.&quot; But thesedays, the employee will get just 30 or 60 days to improve orbe fired, instead of perhaps six months. So, one managersays, the new guidelines mean employees may find themselveson &quot;a measured 100 yards.&quot;   Although the industry executives said it's not clear howmany people will quit or be fired because of the newguidelines, they said they expect perhaps 10% of IBM's U.S.work force to be ranked as fours. That translates to about20,000 people, of whom at least a few thousand can beexpected to leave the company.   Even though the new guidelines won't take effect untilnext year, many employees will probably leave this year.That's because of a program that provides two weeks ofseverance pay per year of employment to people who volunteerto leave this year. That package shrinks to one week a yearin 1992, so people who are under any sort of pressure maydecide to leave quickly.   &quot;I think this is a long-overdue revamping,&quot; said SamAlbert, a former IBM executive who is now a consultant inScarsdale, N.Y. &quot;They're cleaning out the dead wood.&quot;   As part of the new guidelines, IBM is also expected topromise more rewards to those who perform best. That is inkeeping with statements from IBM executives that they don'tview firing as a major way of cutting employment. Rather,they say they view firing as just one of several ways to&quot;raise the bar&quot; for IBM employees and improve the quality ofthe IBM work force.   IBM's standards for itself &quot;have to be escalated to bemore competitive, so the people have to be more competitive,&quot;Walt Burdick, a senior vice president, said in an interviewthis summer. He added that &quot;we want to be a high-demand,high-reward company.&quot;   IBM's stock rose $1.375 to $103.625 in composite tradingon the New York Stock Exchange yesterday and can be expectedto rise further if investors become convinced that IBM isreally serious about cutting costs.</TEXT></DOC>
