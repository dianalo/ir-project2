Mitchell Wilk, said before the new system wasapproved on a 5-0 vote.   Pacific Bell and GTE California, the other company affected,both praised the plan. A consumer group, Toward Utility RateNormalization, called it ``a dangerous ride down an unmapped road.''   The plan, effective next year, is part of an overall policy bythe current PUC, appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, to loosensome of its traditional regulation and scrutiny of managementdecisions by utility companies in telecommunications, energy andtransportation.   Current phone rates are based on the commission's determinationof major phone companies' revenue needs, based on its costs,efficiency and the state of the economy.   Under the new system, rates will be changed annually accordingto this formula: a federal inflation index called the GrossNational Product Price Index will be reduced by 4.5 percent, basedon the assumption that phone companies can increase theirproductivity by that amount each year.   For example, if inflation was 4.8 percent, the figure shown bythe index this past March, the rate increase would be .3 percent.   The companies' basic rate of return on investment would be setat 11.5 percent as of Jan. 1. Carl Danner, an aide to Wilk, saidthe result would probably be a rate decrease of $100 million ormore for Pacific Bell next year and probably little change for GTE,which had a 20 percent rate cut last year.   If a company increased its efficiency to earn a higher rate ofreturn, stockholders could keep all amounts up to 13 percent.Additional earnings up to 16.5 percent would be split 50-50 withratepayers, and any amounts above 16.5 percent would belong toratepayers.   Sometime next year, the current $1.20-a-month charge fortouch-tone telephone service would be eliminated, and the freelocal calling area would be expanded from eight to 12 miles.   The PUC said Pacific Bell would be allowed to spend $405 millionto modernize its system over the next three years so that 950,000customers would have access to services they now lack, includingtouch-tone phones and blocking of ``dial-a-porn'' and othertape-message fee calls.   The commission will also let phone companies cut prices for somehigh-tech and business-oriented services, and require the companiesto assume all financial risks of many new services while keepingall revenues from those services.</TEXT></DOC>
