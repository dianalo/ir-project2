the unit lost about $705,000 on sales of $2.4m in thefirst 32 weeks of Egghead's fiscal 1990 and represented less than 1% ofEgghead's total sales for the period.andM;- o -andM;Xerox Corp has joined forces with Cornell University, Ithaca, New York toform a Design Research Institute to explore methods of machine design: underthe agreement, a group of Xerox scientists and engineers will work atCornell's Ithaca campus, and the partners also plan to seek the involvementof other corporations as well as federal funding for the Institute'sactivities; one aim of the Institute will be the development of a computersystem that will interactively work with a human designer to design a newmachine, being able to respond to the designer's unique methodology andanticipate needs for data, so that realistic models of machines can be buildand tested on a computer screen, reducing the need for building expensiveprototypes.andM;- o -andM;Logic Modeling Systems Inc, Milpitas, California has integrated the SiemensAG Sigraph EL electronic design tools with its LM-1000 hardware modellingsystem and Siemens will provide the LM-1000 to its computer-aided engineeringcustomers as well as to internal users.andM;- o -andM;CMS Enhancements Inc, Tustin, California has enhanced its offerings for theApple Computer Inc Macintosh and Apple IIe and IIGS personal computers: forthe Apple IIs, the company has version of its SCSI interface board, enablingusers to connect any of the company's existing Macintosh hard disk subsystemsto their Apple IIs; users will be able to connect up to 255 32Mb volumes,more than 8Gb and because the board was engineered to incorporate anEPROM-based integrated control panel, users can mount and unmount volumeswithout re-booting and can also boot to ProDOS from any volume and the boardcosts $200, $70 for a ROM upgrade kit; BackupMaster is a new SCSI tape drivesubsystem for the Macintosh that will store 150Mb and 250Mb of data percartridge; the company also announced two 1Gb hard disk subsystems - anexternal PD1000 compatible with all Macs and an internal PI1000 for the II,IIx and IIfx; they are full height 5.25&quot; units with average access time of16.5mS; no prices on these.andM;- o -andM;The UK bill to outlaw hacking that is going through the Commons is causingsome concern to companies that might become victims of hackers: the billcreates a basic offence of actual or attempted unauthorised access that canlead to three months inside; an aggravated offence covering unauthorisedaccess with intent to commit a serious crime; and a new offence ofmodification of computer data, each of which could cause the perpetrator tobe banged up for up to five years - but the concern, reports the TeleputingHotline arises from an amendment that says that the police can apply to anymagistrate rather than a High Court judge for a search and seize warrant,whereupon the police can seize any computer system and software they suspecthas been used in connection with the alleged crime, whether successful ornot, retaining the system for examination, which could be very embarrassingfor the innocent business owner of the computer is suspected to have beenused for hacking by a member of the staff.andM;- o -andM;Symbolics Inc, Burlington, Massachusetts warns that turnover for its thirdquarter to March 31, 1990 will be about $2.2m less than in the previousquarter and that as a result, it expects to see a quarterly operating loss ofaround $4m.andM;- o -andM;Siemens AG of Munich and Berlin and SGS-Thomson Microelectronics SA, Parisand Milan, are to co-operate in the field of high performancemicrocontrollers with the aim of providing a comprehensive and integratedcommon series of parts for high-end 8-bit and 16-bit applications: Siemenshas developed a proprietary family concept of 16-bit microcontrollers and iscurrently introducing the first family member, the SAB 80C166 with aperformance &quot;superior to any other 16-bit controller currently announced oravailable&quot; while SGS has its modular ST9 family, a proprietary architecturewith a large number of versions already available, with peripherals, EPROMand EEPROM options integrated on chip; each will second source the other'sparts, and will each continue to support their current microcontrollersfamilies, notably the 8051-compatible family by Siemens and ST6 and ST8 bySGS.andM;- o -andM;Another buzz is going around the City over a partner for ICL, and this timethe name in the frame is once again Siemens AG: despite the almost completelack of industrial logic, nothing can be ruled out, since STC Plc seemsdetermined to offload one of the two strongest arms of its business - theother being the cables business that contributed the C to its name - and theone argument in favour of Siemens - the suggestion is that it would pay #500mfor 50% plus one share and control of ICL - is that Siemens and Fujitsu Ltd,ICL's chip supplier, have been bes' friends for years; arguments againstinclude the fact that Siemens is wedded to near-IBM-compatibility, and ICL isimplacably opposed to that route, so much so that key people would likelyleave the company rather countenance selling Siemens mainframes; and the factthat while Siemens and its future partner, Nixdorf Computer AG, are firmsupporters of the Open Software Foundation, ICL is equally firmly in the UnixInternational camp, being a contributor to Unix System V.4; the open warfarebetween the two camps would mean that it would be impossible for ICL to liveharmoniously with Siemens and if the latter were in control, the mainmedium-term result would be the elimination of a competitor; ICL would beforced against its will to enter the Open Software Foundation Unix camp, andto dump its own mainframes in favour of the machines Siemens has still tosell successfully inandP; the UK market.andM;- o -andM;IBM is said to have pencilled in May 16 for discussion of some  of its plansin the mainframe arena.andM;- o -andM;You saw it coming, didn't you: Novell Inc shareholders have filed a classaction suit against the company and Lotus Development Corp over the price atwhich the latter intends to acquire Novell, saying that the latter is worth$50 or so a share against the share exchange valuation of around $40, andseeking an injunction preventing the two from proceding with the merger.andM;- o -andM;This week or next, Solbourne Computer Corp is expected to announce an OEMagreement with Network Computing Devices Inc and trot out the latter'smonochrome and colour X terminals under its own name: Solbourne is expectedto tout the performance to be had from the displays when tied to itsmulti-processor servers, at competitive tags.andM;- o -andM;Commenting on its storming first quarter figures - page five - Intel Corpnotes that while traditionally dull first quarter sales were flat with thoseof the fourth quarter of 1989, profits at $144m compared with $123m in thelast quarter - but that was after a charge for closure of a plant; it saysthat the transition to 32-bit architectures picked up momentum in the pastsix months, and that 80386 shipments were double those of the the same perioda year ago; prices are coming down, with the 25MHz 80386 now $190 for1,000-up against $215 in December, and the 16MHz 80386SX is now $64, downfrom $73; Intel plans to invest about $600m in plant and equipment this year.andM;- o -andM;Western Digital Corp, Irvine, California has signed a patent cross-licenceagreement with IBM, giving Western with a five-year licence covering a broadrange of its products including integrated circuits, disk and videocontrollers, and other circuit boards;

Key Tronic did not name theplaintiff.andM;- o -andM;Plessey Co Plc's acquisition of Leigh Instruments Inc, Ottawa has turned outto be a time bomb ticking away under GEC Siemens Plc following theiracquisition of Plessey: it has entered bankruptcy proceedings after closingits aerospace equipment plant in Ottawa and components and systems divisionsin Ottawa and Toronto and laying off 750 of its employees; liquidatators havebeen called in to wind it up.andM;- o -andM;Matsushita Electric Industrial Co has committed to increase the proportion offoreign chips in group products to 20% by July next year: the proportion isat present 13.3%.andM;- o -andM;The storm over Control Data Corp chairman Robert Price's retirement andseverance packages totalling over $5m (CI No 1,397) has got to the man: hewill not seek reelection as non-excutive chairman at the annual meeting onMay 2, and the company is looking again at the $1.35m in consultancy paymentsit had planned to make to him over the next three years; plans for him towork on CDC quality control programmes have also been abandoned.andM;- o -andM;The US Federal Communications Commission has removed the &quot;experimental&quot; tagfrom Airfone Inc's airliner-to-ground telephone service and confirmed use ofthe 4GHz band for the purpose: other carriers will be licensed to offercompeting air-to-ground service, including Airfone founder Jack Goeken's newIn-Flight Phone company, which wants to offer a digital service incompetition with Airfone's analogue one, starting in the autumn;

No sooner do we hear that the onlypart of the Next Plc fashion retailing group that is showing any signs oflife is its Next Directory catologue business, than Nixdorf Computer'sNixdorf Plus office equipment division announces &quot;The Directory&quot;, a catalogueof office products; will they too have an advertising campaign shot in anunderwater location, we wonder?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
