The various tumour components (whether solid, cysticor calcified) were evaluated separately. Three types of cysts were observedthat can be distinguished by their signal intensity in various pulsesequences. This could be explained largely by an analysis of the T/sub1/ and T/sub 2/ image contrast. The reason for the various types of cystsis determined by their cholesterol content. MR imaging is not as usefulas CT for demonstrating the solid and calcified portions of the tumourand this reduces its value in diagnosing the type of tumour. Againstthat, it is superior with regard to separating the tumour from its neighbouringstructures. The differential diagnosis, which must be considered in usingMR, is summarised in a table at the end of the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
