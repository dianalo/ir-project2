The current limitation of the definitionto organizations ``controlled by U.S. citizens'' was incorporated withoutexplanation when the general regulations implementing section 101(a)(5)were first promulgated by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 1982.The requirement that corporations and similar entities be organized underUnited States or any State law, and therefore subject to United Statesjurisdiction, will be retained to ensure these entities are accountablefor their actions and to maintain consistency with the Act. The Act prohibits all taking of marine mammals, including harassment, unlessspecifically allowed by the Act or by procedures established under provisionsof the Act. In 1981, the Act was amended to add section 101(a)(5) authorizingthe Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to allow ``citizens of theUnited States'' to engage in specified activities (other than commercialfishing) within specific geographic regions during periods of not morethan five consecutive years that result in the incidental, but not intentional,taking of small numbers of non-depleted marine mammals. In early 1982, the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed ``RegulationsGoverning Small Takes of Marine Mammals Incidental to Specified Activities''(50 CFR part 228) to implement the new provisions of the Act (47 FR 9027).In response to comments, a definition of `` `Citizens of the United States'and `U.S. citizen' '' was added without explanation or opportunity forcomment in the final regulations published in May 1982 (47 FR 21248). ``RegulationsGoverning Small Takes of Marine Mammals Incidental to Specified Activities''(50 CFR 18.27) which were virtually identical to those adopted by the NationalMarine Fisheries Service were promulgated by the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService in July 1983 (48 FR 31220). Both sets of regulations establish standards and procedures for determiningwhether the taking of small numbers of non-depleted marine mammals incidentalto specified activities (other than commercial fishing) should be allowedand included the following definition: <ITAG tagnum="21">``Citizens of the United States'' and ``U.S. citizens'' means individualU.S. citizens or any partnership, corporation, association, or similarentity if it is organized under the laws of the United States or any governmentalunit defined in 16 U.S.C. 1362(13) and controlled by individuals who areU.S. citizens. U.S. Federal, State, and local government agencies shallalso constitute citizens of the United States for purposes of this section.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Under this definition, foreign controlled corporations and similarentities, including their subsidiaries, cannot obtain Letters of Authorizationnecessary to proceed with specific activities that may result in the incidentaltaking of marine mammals under United States jurisdiction.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Servicejointly proposed to amend the incidental take framework regulations onMarch 15, 1988 (53 FR 8473). That rule, which did not address the definitionof citizen of the United States, was proposed to implement amendments tosection 101(a)(5) of the Act adopted in 1986. The 1986 amendments authorizedthe issuance of specific regulations for the incidental take of depleted,as well as non-depleted, marine mammals.In commenting on the proposed rule, the American Petroleum Institute, MineralsManagement Service and several other entities stated that the existingdefinition of citizen of the United States as applied to a corporationis unduly restrictive since it requires control by American citizens. Thecommenters also noted that the definition of citizen of the United Statesin the marine mammal incidental take regulations is inconsistent with regulatorypractice under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act which requires onlythat a corporation be organized under the laws of the United States (i.e.,be subject to United States jurisdiction). They believe that the Congressintended that all holders of offshore leases be permitted to receive Lettersof Authorization under the Act and, therefore, that the definition in themarine mammal regulations should be consistent with Outer Continental ShelfLands Act regulatory practice.The clear language in section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal ProtectionAct only authorizes United States citizens to take marine mammals incidentalto specified activities (other than commercial fishing). However, thereis no suggestion in the Act or its legislative history that Congress intendedto preclude corporations or similar entities organized under United Statesor any State law from qualifying as United States citizens.Generally, corporations and similar entities that are organized under,and therefore subject to, United States or State laws are considered personsin a legal sense and are afforded many of the same rights as individualcitizens of the United States regardless of who owns or controls the entity.Similarly, for purposes of section 101(a)(5) of the Act, we are proposingthat corporations and similar entities organized under United States orState laws be considered citizens of the United States without restrictionas to controlling interest.In extending this definition to include all corporations and similar entities,it is desirable to avoid situations where non-citizens can circumvent theintent of the statute to limit the availability of incidental take Lettersof Authorization to United States citizens. By similar entities, therefore,the Services mean only those entities recognized under United States orState laws to be legal persons for purposes of legal jurisdiction and legalliability. Most, if not all, corporations or similar entities created pursuantto State or Federal law would meet this requirement. Therefore, referenceto partnerships and associations are proposed to be deleted from the definition.This would not preclude individuals who are United States citizens or corporationsorganized under United States or any State law from forming a partnershipor other associations since they would be considered as applying in theircapacity as United States citizens or corporations.The requirement in the definition of ``United States citizen'' that corporationsand similar entities must be controlled by individuals who are United Statescitizens appears to be unduly restrictive without any corresponding benefitsto marine mammals. As has been noted, the requirement that corporationsbe controlled by individuals who are United States citizens is inconsistentwith regulatory practice under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Inaddition, it could adversely affect otherwise acceptable activities andsubstantially reduce revenues from the sale of offshore oil and gas leases.Elimination of this limitation in the definition of United States citizenappears to be warranted and desirable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Regulatory Change</ITAG>These regulations propose to amend the definition of ``citizen of the UnitedStates and U.S. citizen'' in 50 CFR 18.27(c) and 228.3 by deleting therequirement that corporations and similar entities be ``controlled by individualswho are U.S. citizens.'' Consistent with the preamble discussion, it isalso proposed that the specific reference to partnerships and associationsin the definition be deleted. These revisions are proposed to allow Lettersof Authorization to incidentally take marine mammals to be granted to corporationsand similar entities not controlled by United States citizens. The requirementthat corporations and similar entities be organized under United Statesor any State law, and therefore subject to United States jurisdiction,would be retained.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Department of the Interior, as the lead agency, has prepared a draftenvironmental assessment of this proposed rule. A determination will bemade at the time of the final rule as to whether or not this is a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentwithin the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969. Section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, andimplementing regulations, require that the impacts of any authorized incidentaltake on marine mammal populations be negligible and that there be no unmitigableadverse impacts on their use for subsistence purposes. The proposed modificationof the definition of ``citizen of the United States'' does not alter thisstandard.It has been determined that these regulations constitute a major rule asdefined in Executive Order 12291. Without the proposed definitional change,Federal revenues from offshore leasing bonus bids are likely to be reducedby more than $100 million annually. However, considering time constraintsand the nature of the rulemaking, the Office of Management and Budget,consistent with section 6(a)(4) of the Executive Order, has waived therequirement for preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.The Department of the Interior has certified under terms of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) that the proposed regulations will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Most requestsfor specific regulations to incidentally take marine mammals under therevised regulations are, as at present, likely to be from the oil and gasand related industries; they would not be considered small entities underthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.This rule does not contain an information collection requirement subjectto Office of Management and Budget clearance under the Paperwork ReductionAct (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).The analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act, Executive Order12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act are available for review (see<T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).The primary author of this proposal is Robert A. Peoples, Jr., Departmentof the Interior.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>50 CFR Part 18Administrative practice and procedure, Alaska, Exports, Imports, Intergovernmentalrelations, Marine mammals, Transportation.50 CFR Part 228Administrative practice and procedure, Marine mammals, Outer continentalshelf oil and gas exploration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Regulation Promulgation</ITAG>Accordingly, the Service proposes to amend 50 CFR parts 18 and 228 as shownbelow.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 18_MARINE MAMMALS</ITAG>1.
