TheBoard encourages all interested parties to comment on each of these proposals.The Board urges that in filing comments on these proposals, commentersprepare separate letters for each proposal, identifying the appropriatedocket number on each. This procedure will facilitate the Board's processingand analysis of the comments on these proposals by ensuring that each commentis quickly brought to the attention of those responsible for analyzingeach specific proposal. In addition, the Board encourages entities thatplan to submit identical comments, such as affiliated institutions withina holding company, to consolidate their efforts; the Board will give equalconsideration to one letter signed by a number of commenters as it wouldto numerous identical letters submitted by those commenters. Comments aredue November 17, 1989, and the Board does not intend to extend the commentperiod beyond that date.In addition to its requests for comment, the Board is also issuing todaythree risk-related policy statements regarding private delivery-against-paymentsystems (Docket No. R-0665), offshore clearing and netting systems (DocketNo. R-0666), and rollovers and continuing contracts (Docket No. R-0667).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Board's current payments system risk reduction program establishesa maximum amount of intraday funds overdrafts that depository institutionsare permitted to incur over both Fedwire and private large-dollar paymentssystems. The maximum, or cap, is a multiple of a depository institution'sadjusted primary capital and is based on a self-evaluation of a depositoryinstitution's creditworthiness, credit policies, and operational controls.Since the initiation of the policy in 1986, the daylight overdrafts onFedwire associated with book-entry transfers have been exempt from thecap limits, pending development of procedures to bring these extensionsof credit by Reserve Banks within the ambit of the policy. (For additionalbackground on the Board's payments system risk reduction program, see DocketNo. R-0668, elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.) For depository institutions that are majorclearers of government securities, however, such caps would have to besizeable to cover the overdrafts associated with the operations of an efficientmarket for U.S. government securities.\1\<NOTE/> As described more fully below, the Board proposes changesto its payments system risk reduction program that will more fully securethe Reserve Banks, while continuing to provide flexibility to depositoryinstitutions engaged in clearing U.S. government securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For foreign banks, caps that reflect their world-widecapital would allow overdrafts of a size that would be inappropriate giventheir U.S. assets subject to U.S. supervision and their U.S. funding capacity.(For the Board's proposals regarding foreign banks see Docket No. R-0670,elsewhere in today's Federal Register.) In the case of foreign banks, collateralhas been looked to as the means to secure overdrafts above the cap leveland has been considered in the past as a means of securing book-entry relatedoverdrafts. In reviewing this policy, the Board has concluded that partialcollateralization of Fedwire overdrafts is not desirable.<T3>Proposed policy regarding book-entry securities transfers. </T3>TheBoard is requesting comment on the following multi-faceted proposal todeal with book-entry overdrafts:andbullet; To combine book-entry overdrafts with funds overdrafts to createa combined Fedwire overdraft within the existing cap structure;andbullet; To require depository institutions that frequently exceed theirFedwire cap by material amounts solely because of book-entry transfersto collateralize their total Fedwire exposure; andbullet; To use discount window collateral not in use for that purposeheld either by the Reserve Bank or the depository institution as the firstpreferred source of collateral and other assets held by the depositoryinstitution as the second preferred source of collateral; and andbullet; To use as a final source of collateral, book-entry securitiesbeing transferred, in the interim marked on the depository institution'sown books, and, in the long run, segregated and valued in real time onthe books of the Reserve Bank. As previously noted, the Board's current payments system risk reductionprogram exempts book-entry related daylight overdrafts from cross-systemnet debit caps. In making this decision, the Board realized that, for thevast majority of depository institutions, book-entry overdrafts are smallin size and present limited risk to the Federal Reserve System. By far,the majority of book-entry overdrafts are concentrated in a few clearingbanks which serve the major dealers and brokers in government securities.Restricting the overdrafts of these banks could impede the smooth functioningof the government securities market. On two previous occasions the Board has issued for public comment proposalsthat would deal with the risks arising from book-entry overdrafts by requiringthat such overdrafts be collateralized (50 FR 21132, May 22, 1985, and51 FR 45046, December 16, 1986). On both occasions, commenters have agreedthat the Federal Reserve should be protected by collateral but have arguedthat the means proposed to do so were too restrictive and rigid in nature.The previous proposals focused on the use of those book-entry securitiesin transit that give rise to the overdraft as collateral rather than onother possible types of collateral. Commenters argued that reliance onthis collateral would burden book-entry processing with complex and costlycontrol processes. As a result, a collateralization policy has not beenadopted, though the underlying causes of book-entry overdrafts have beenat least partially addressed by a limit on transaction size, increasedsecrutiny of dealer clearing practices, and issuance of guidelines fordealer clearance behavior. These measures to control book-entry overdrafts have had some success,particularly as they relate to the value of overdrafts per dollar of securitiestransferred and to the size and timing of peak overdrafts at large clearingbanks. Book-entry related overdrafts, however, still account for 60 percentof all Fedwire peak intraday overdrafts and have an average peak valueof approximately $60 billion per day. Further, these overdrafts continueto be highly concentrated at a small number of depository institutions,primarily clearing banks located in New York City. The four largest clearingbanks, while reducing their overdrafts for the reasons noted above, stillaccount for about two-thirds of all book-entry related daylight overdrafts.The ten largest clearing banks account for approximately 80 percent ofall such overdrafts. The government securities markets could be seriouslydisrupted if these institutions were significantly restricted in theirability to provide intraday credit to their customers. On the other hand,if one of these institutions were to experience a problem requiring overnightfunding, the overdrafts involved could present considerable risk to itsReserve Bank. Thus, there continues to be a need to develop a program thatwill protect the Federal Reserve by collateralizing large book-entry overdraftswhile at the same time recognizing the wide disparity among depositoryinstitutions incurring overdrafts and the types of business such overdraftsreflect. In response to this need, the Board has developed a proposal that integratesbook-entry overdrafts with funds overdrafts for measurement purposes andprovides for flexible treatment of the relatively few institutions thatincur very large overdrafts. This proposal has several aspects. First,it recognizes that book-entry overdrafts are similar to those created byfunds transfers in that both expose the Federal Reserve to the risk ofloss. Thus, there seems to be little reason to continue the policy of separatingthe two types of overdrafts and creating, at times, misleading the twotypes of overdrafts and creating, at times, misleading overdraft data forindividual depository institutions. For the vast majority of depositoryinstitutions, combining book-entry and funds overdrafts under the currentcap structure would have little effect. In the last quarter of 1988, onlysix depository institutions with assets over $1 billion and 41 with assetsunder $1 billion would have experienced increases in their cap utilizationrates of more than 25 percent under such a program. Of those 47 depositoryinstitutions, only 15 would have exceeded their caps as a result of theinclusion of book-entry overdrafts. Five large depository institutionswhose total overdrafts exceeded their caps because of their book-entryoverdrafts are major clearing banks. The total Fedwire overdrafts of thesedepository institutions (all of which would be collateralized under theproposal, as discussed below) account for almost 40 percent of the aggregateFederal Reserve direct credit risks resulting from daylight overdrafts.The ten remaining banks that would exceed their cap due to book-entry overdraftsaccount for only 0.2 percent of total Fedwire overdrafts. The Board believes that book-entry and funds overdrafts should be combinedunder the current cap program. The Board does not believe, however, thatthe few depository institutions severely affected should be required toreduce overdraft levels, as they would be if caps had been exceeded asa result of funds transfers. Rather, the Board proposes that these depositoryinstitutions be asked to collateralize the total exposure they create forReserve Banks from funds and book-entry overdrafts. This collateralizationpolicy will apply only to these depository institutions that frequentlyincur total Fedwire daylight overdrafts that, solely because of book-entryrelated overdrafts, are materially in excess of their Fedwire caps. Allother depository institutions will be expected to manage their total overdrafts(funds and book-entry) within the existing cap system, with the exceptionof occasional, modest daylight overdrafts that are due solely to book-entrytransfers. A second aspect of the Board's proposal would provide that collateral coverthe entire daylight overdraft of an affected depository institution, notjust that created by book-entry overdrafts. This reflects the reality that,if Federal Reserve lending at the discount window is needed, the entirecredit must be collateralized, not just that portion created by book-entrytransfers or that amount in excess of the depository institution's cap.The third aspect of the Board's proposal involves the type of collateralto be used to secure the overdraft. The Board believes that discount windowand other pools of acceptable collateral, held either by the Reserve Bankor by the depository institution, should be relied upon, to the extentpossible, to cover daylight overdrafts. Discount window collateral andportfolio pools of assets are more easily identified than the book-entrysecurities being transferred that are eligible for pledge to secure overdrafts.Such collateral would cover a large portion of many large depository institutions'overdrafts. Moreover, using existing discount window collateral and assetpools as a primary source of collateral for overdrafts minimizes the needto rely on book-entry securities being transferred as collateral and wouldhelp to avoid potential conflicting claims on these securities. Some depositoryinstitutions may be able to pledge the securities being transferred bysome customers, primarily brokers and dealers, to cover the depositoryinstitution's book-entry overdrafts, but depending on the availabilityof discount window collateral and asset pools this may not be necessaryin all cases. Any security agreement between a Reserve Bank and a depositoryinstitution will exclude collateral that the institution is not authorizedto pledge. Each depository institution subject to this collateralizationrequirement will be expected to work with its Reserve Bank to develop themix of discount window collateral, other asset pools, and incoming book-entrysecurities to be used as collateral. The resulting program of collateralizationwill thus be customized to the depository institution so as to accommodateits business needs as well as to provide adequate protection to the ReserveBank. The final aspect of the Board's collateralization proposal concerns themanner in which rights to collateral in the form of book-entry securitiesbeing transferred will be conveyed to Reserve Banks. Ideally, such securitieswould be segregated in real-time on Reserve Banks' books, valued at marketprice less appropriate haircuts, and released from pledge to the ReserveBanks only as daylight overdrafts are extinguished. Such a process wouldinvolve extensive operational changes at both depository institutions andReserve Banks, requiring a long lead time for development and implementation.Thus, the Board believes that using incoming book-entry securities as collateralshould be accomplished in two phases, interim and long run. In the interim,those depository institutions that would find it necessary to repledgecustomer securities to Reserve Banks would mark the repledged collateralon their own books and not segregate the collateral at the Reserve Bank.Unfortunately, under this arrangement, a Reserve Bank could not assureon a real-time basis that the total collateral actually pledged, i.e.,discount window collateral, other asset pools, and securities being transferredand marked on the depository institution's books, would be sufficient tocover the depository institution's overdraft. However, as an interim measure,the intraday pledge of book-entry securities, recorded on the books ofthe overdrafting depository institution, would reduce the unsecured creditrisk now incurred by the Reserve Banks. In the long run, intraday on-line valuation and segregation capabilities,similar to the services clearing banks now provide their customers, willbe available as a result of the Reserve Banks' decision to design and developa new book-entry operating system. This effort is expected to take threeeto five years to implement and will require extensive changes by ReserveBanks, depository institutions, and the major government securities dealers.Concurrently, the Department of the Treasury is in the process of revisingits regulations that govern the legal transfer of interests in U.S. governmentsecurities. The Reserve Banks will be working with all interested partiesto assure that the future book-entry securities system not only providesthe means of efficiently and prudently securing Fedwire book-entry daylightoverdrafts, but also includes the capabilities, procedures, and protectionsthat will serve the future needs of the clearing banks, the dealer community,and their customers. The Board expects the Reserve Banks to implement the new book-entry securitiesprogram with considerable flexibility. Reserve Banks are to require anydepository institution that frequently exceeds its Fedwire cap becauseof book-entry overdrafts to collateralize its entire overdraft. However,the specific application of the collateral requirement is to be workedout by the Reserve Bank and the depository institution on a case-by-casebasis. Reserve Banks will determine the definition of ``frequently andmaterially'' on a flexible basis, and will work to perfect an interestin the types of collateral the depository institution can most easily provide.It would be expected that both the type and loan value of the collateralwould be consistent with each Reserve Bank's discount window policies,even if the collateral used is not routinely taken for discount windowpurposes. Finally, if book-entry securites being transferred are neededas collateral, Reserve Banks will work with each depository institutionto determine what internal processes are needed to ensure the best repledgeof securities that can be effected. To implement this proposal, Reserve Banks will: andbullet; Work flexibly with each depository institution affected by theproposal; andbullet; Accept only the type and loan value of collateral that would bebroadly consistent with the Bank's discount window policies; andbullet; Develop model agreements for pledging collateral held in the possessionof Reserve Banks, held for discount window purposes by the depository institution,or repledged by the institution as a result of customer book-entry transferbusiness; and andbullet; Develop a new book-entry system that will provide the means forsegregation and valuation of book-entry securities being transferred onReserve Bank books.<ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,June 15, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
