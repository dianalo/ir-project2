Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FFC </CO><IN> INS </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The California Supreme Court, showing its new conservative stripes, reversed a landmark 1979 ruling that gave consumers broad power to sue insurance companies for mishandling accident claims.    &quot;It is a dark day for insurance consumers and a bright day for the insurance industry,&quot; said William Shernoff, a Claremont, Calif., attorney who has handled many such suits for accident victims.    Mr. Shernoff predicted the decision would lead to more &quot;bad-faith practices&quot; by insurance companies. But industry officials denied that, and asserted that the decision would hold down rising litigation costs and reduce pressures for future rate increases.    The previous ruling gave injured persons the right to sue insurers under a state law that required companies to pay claims promptly once liability seemed reasonably clear. The ruling had been widely used by accident victims to extract major settlements from insurers, who claimed the system amounted to legalized extortion and substantially pushed up rates.    But in a 5-2 opinion written by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, the court held that the prior decision &quot;generated and will continue to produce inequitable results, costly multiple litigation, and unnecessary confusion unless we overrule it.&quot; Justice Lucas noted that few states had followed California's lead in establishing a statutory private right of action for such claims.    Under the ruling, victims will still be able to sue insurers for improper claims handling. But they face much stiffer standards of proof.    The case involved a suit against the insurance unit of Fireman's Fund Corp. In Novato, Calif., a company spokesman said: &quot;This victory brings a much needed consistency to this area of the law. Under the way the law had been, the plaintiff got two bites at the apple, first suing the insured and then the insurer. We corrected that inequity.&quot;    The case involved a 1983 auto accident in Los Angeles. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. agreed to pay a $7,750 settlement the following year on behalf of one of its policy holders. Later, the victim sued the insurer directly, alleging that it had acted in bad faith by refusing her original settlement demands. A trial court dismissed that suit, but a state appellate court reinstated it, citing the 1979 supreme court holding.    Dissenting from the latest ruling, Justice Stanley Mosk wrote: &quot;The insurance industry has succeeded in persuading justices of this court that it is entitled to immunity from the same type of responsibility required of every other business and individual that commit deceptive practices.&quot;    The statute had been used primarily by third parties to recover damages against allegedly recalcitrant insurers.    The decision noted that insurance companies will still be subject to regulatory sanctions for improper claims handling. It also noted that consumers will be able to bring civil suits for damages on other grounds, including fraud or the infliction of emotional distress.    Plaintiffs' attorneys, however, say that industry regulation has been lax. In addition, they argue that alternative lawsuits require heavy burdens of proof, including establishment of wrongful intent. Under the 1979 ruling, victims needed only to persuade a court that a carrier hadn't &quot;promptly and fairly&quot; handled a claim.    &quot;Juries tend to be very unsympathetic to insurance companies when given very general guidelines,&quot; said N. Douglas Martin, a Fireman's Fund attorney.    The decision was the first time the court, controlled by conservative appointees of Gov. George Deukmejian, overruled a major civil case decided under former Chief Justice Rose Bird. Justice Bird and two colleagues were ousted in a bitter election battle in November 1986. The new court has taken a harder line in death-penalty cases, but has been split outside criminal issues.    The decision comes as insurers and trial attorneys in the state battle over several insurance reform measures set for the November ballot. One consumer-backed initiative, among other things, would restore the private claim that the high court yesterday abolished. But the industry is waging a $43 million campaign in support of an opposing initiative.    Insurance companies asserted that the decision would benefit consumers as well as the industry. &quot;It will have a positive impact on adjustment and litigation expenses,&quot; said a spokesman for Western Insurance Information Services, a Tustin, Calif., trade-sponsored group. &quot;Ultimately, like anything that is paid for in claims dollars, that gets reflected in what insurers in a competitive marketplace charge.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
