They said dozens of rockets and howitzer shells landed onbeaches of the besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave north andeast of Beirut, but the Christians did not return the fire.   Some shell also crashed in residential areas of Christian eastBeirut, the heart of the Christian enclave.   The Cypriot ferry Larnaca Rose, making its first voyage toLebanon since fighting forced it to stop the journeys April 24, wasordered by its agents to turn back as the firing escalated afternighfall. The ferry is one of the few escape methods for Christianstrying to flee the enclave.   Arab League mediators accused Syria's Moslem allies of violatingthe truce declared in the 2-month-old battle between Gen. MichelAoun's Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian forces andDruse militiamen.   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate given in 1976, a year after the sectariancivil war began, and has become the country's main power broker.Its troops patrol west Beirut.   League envoys Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, andAbdel-Aziz Jassem, Kuwait's ambassador to Syria, ended two days oftalks with Christian and Moslem leaders Thursday and drove toDamascus.   Ibrahimi, personal envoy of Chedli Klibi, secretary-general ofthe Arab League, said before departure: ``We remain fullyoptimistic that the truce adopted by the Arab League last week .. .will be implemented.''   The truce was proclaimed April 28, but disputes over a clauseabout lifting blockades of ports delayed its implementation.   Moslems say the provision includes illegal harbors run bymilitias, which Aoun's forces blockaded March 6.   His blockade started the artillery battle that has raged since.Police say 278 people have been killed and 1,010 wounded, nearlyall of them civilians.   Aoun initially refused to lift the siege. Ibrahimi metseparately Wednesday with Aoun, who heads a Christian Cabinet inLebanon's dual government, and acting Premier Salim Hoss, who leadsthe Moslem government.   Lebanon's government split in September when the six-year termof Amin Gemayel, the Christian president, ended with Parliamentunable to agree on a successor. The army also divided intoChristian and Moslem commands.   After his meeting with the general, Ibrahimi said thedifferences over the ports had been eliminated and declared:``There's no justification for a single shot to be fired in Lebanonfrom now on.''   Intermittent artillery and rocket fire occurred both Wednesdaynight and Thursday, however.   Jassem, the other envoy, said Thursday: ``The cease-fire isbeing violated from west Beirut and not from east Beirut,'' thecity's Christian sector. He spoke to reporters after meeting withHassan Khalid, religious leader of Lebanon's Sunni Moslems.   In Washington, the State Department praised Aoun's decision tolift the port blockade. ``The United States welcomes theannouncement by Gen. Aoun that he will suspend temporarily hisblockade of the ports,'' said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.   In a statement carried by the Voice of Lebanon, a Christianradio station, Jassem said the Arab League effort was not ``a magicwand.''   He and Ibrahimi also conferred with Hoss on Thursday, for thesecond time in as many days, and with Sheik Mohammed MehdiShamseddin, the highest-ranking Shiite Moslem clergyman.   They visited the Soviet and French embassies, said sources closeto the mediators, and met with the U.S. charge d'affaires, DanielSimpson.   Simpson was quoted by the newspaper An-Nahar as saying: ``Thecease-fire ... makes me sleep better and no one gets hurt. Istrongly support it.''   Ibrahimi said his contacts informed him the United States andSoviet Union ``support the Arab initiative.''   The league's peace plan also calls for deployment of Arabmilitary observers to monitor the truce and oversee reopening ofthe harbors and of the Beirut airport, which closed soon after theshooting started.</TEXT></DOC>
