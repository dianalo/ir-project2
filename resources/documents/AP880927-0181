Forty-two percent in the ABC News poll conducted Monday nightsaid the debate was a tie or didn't know who won _ more than doublethe 20 percent who expressed one of those views after the debateSunday night.   ABC's and other post-debate polls Sunday night indicated noclear debate winner, and the network's Monday poll indicated thatnews reports portraying the confrontation as a tie had increasedperceptions of it as such.   The new poll, released Tuesday, included likely voters who hadnot seen the debate but had heard or read about it. The first pollwas just among those who had watched some or all of the debate.   In the new poll, 34 percent said Michael Dukakis won the debate_ down from 44 percent who said so Sunday _ and 24 percent saidBush won, down from 36 percent who held that view Sunday. Aplurality of those who picked Bush and a majority of those whopicked Dukakis said they won only by a little.   The poll indicated that the debate reinforced preferences ratherthan changing them. Eighty percent said the debate had not switchedtheir vote and majorities said it had not made them more likely tovote for either candidate. More than nine in 10 who picked a winnerplan to vote for that man; those who called it a tie were splitevenly in candidate preference.   ABC conducted the poll among 416 likely voters who had watchedthe debate, read about it or heard about it. The margin of errorwas plus or minus six percentage points.</TEXT></DOC>
