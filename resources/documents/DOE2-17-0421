This information,which serves to fully characterize electron features in the plasma, waspursued by measuring laser-light Thomson scattering. Thomson scatteringis the scattering of incident radiation by free electrons in a discharge.Because electrons in a plasma move with extremely high average velocity,the scattered light is substantially Doppler shifted. If the incidentlight source possesses a narrow spectral band width, as is the case witha laser, the scattered radiation can be detected as a spectrally-broadenedsignal centered at the incident laser wavelength. The width of this Doppler-broadenedspectrum can then be related to the average velocity of the electronswithin th e plasma, and the integrated intensity of the scattered lightcan be related to the electron concentration in the probed volume. Unfortunately,Thomson-scattering measurements are not easily made; the scattering phenomenonis weak, and a rather complex instrumental system is required. The workdescribed here employed to sequentially designed experimental systemsthat were used successfully to make Thomson-scattering measurements inthe ICP.</TEXT></DOC>
