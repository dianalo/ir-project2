HEATH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Financial activity slowed Fridaydue to a shortage of paper money, and President Raul Alfonsinscheduled meetings with political, business and labor leaders todiscuss solutions to the nation's economic problems.   The Central Bank ordered a partial bank holiday late Thursdaynight, explaining that a delay in delivery of imported paper to thenational mint, which prints bills, and a labor dispute at the minthad produced a shortage of currency.   Central Bank Vice President Roberto Eilbaum said paper hadarrived, the labor conflict had been resolved and that employeeswould work over the long weekend, which includes a May 1 Labor Dayholiday, to resolve the shortage.   Meanwhile, he said, Friday banking activity would be restrictedto the cashing of pension checks and the paychecks of public andprivate employees.   Eilbaum said no changes in economic or exchange policy wereplanned and that all banks and exchange houses will open normallyon Tuesday.   He also denied that the shortage of currency was responsible forthe strengthening of the austral, the national currency, againstthe dollar in financial activity Thursday.   The austral on Thursday gained back most of the ground it lostduring feverish devaluation earlier in the week, closing at 75 perdollar.   The week's fluctuations followed a two-month drop in value ofthe austral and touched off price increases, the suspension ofcredit card sales, and shortages of some medicines and foods.   The fluctuations also provoked anger at the government and fearof social unrest.   The exchange rate on April 21 was 72 to 1; on Monday 82 to 1; onTuesday 96 to 1 and on Wednesday 84 to 1. The austral, worth 17 to1 on Feb. 3, has declined in value by about 77 percent since Feb.5, when the Central Bank allowed the currency to float, ending itspolicy of using dwindling reserves to prop it up.   Alfonsin invited presidential candidates, heads of politicalparties, and business and labor union leaders to separate meetingsat the government house and the official residence to discuss theeconomic crisis as well as steps to be followed during thetransition period following scheduled May 14 elections.   Presidential spokesman Jose Ignacio Lopez told reportersThursday that Alfonsin had called the meetings to ``materializecommon ideas aimed at improving the economic situation, ensuringthe political transition and reassuring the population.''   Alfonsin was expected to seek support for a series of economicmeasures, including reforms in the exchange market, restraint ongovernment spending and possible steps to increase governmentincome.   The General Confederation of Labor, the country's 4million-member labor federation, called Thursday for immediatepayment of the ``mid-year bonus,'' a bonus equivalent to half amonth's pay that all employers are obliged to pay employees in June.   Labor Minister Ideler Tonelli on Thursday discarded thepossibility of an immediate general wage increase, but said themeasure could be considered if it became necessary.</TEXT></DOC>
