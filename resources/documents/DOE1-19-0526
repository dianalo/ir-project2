When the fibers were coated with asilane coupling agent, the measured bond strength (20 MPa) was twicethe value (10 MPa) obtained for the samples without coupling agent. Bondingbetween the same fibers and polycarbonate was examined using scanningelectron microscopy. Fibers coated with an amino-silane coupling agentshowed considerably better bonding to the polymer compared with the uncoatedfibers. Work in progress involves optimization of the bonding in polycarbonate,and an examination of the bonding between the same fibers and polyacetal.4 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
