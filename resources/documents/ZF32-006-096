Markey (D-Mass.) said, Bush would want toveto the bill and be labeled the &quot;junk call&quot; president.andM;After a fierce battle by telemarketers, Congress has finally bowed to theagonized screams of the vast majority of its constituents who are nightlybombarded with computer-generated telephone calls that interrupt dinner andfurther jangle nerves just beginning to recover from the nightly trek homefrom work.andM;Under the new legislation, junk fax messages would be directly outlawed, aswould marketing &quot;cold&quot; calls to cellular telephones, telephone pagingdevices, and any emergency numbers.andM;The bill also says that only one line of a business can be tied up by asolicitor at one time, although how one salesman could know that anotherboiler room caller from another state was phoning the same business isn'texplained in the bill.andM;Although the bill as it was first introduced would have banned auto-dialedcalls completely, the final version was much weakened by allowing for callsto consenting households, as well as allowing voice mail forwarding and billcollection agencies to be exempted from the ban on computerized calls.andM;The Federal Communications Commission is also tasked with devising a way totrack and perhaps automatically block calls to those people who register asbeing opposed to all human solicitation calls.andP;  This could lead to a databaseof the sort now used by the junk mail industry.andM;Even if this part of the bill is put into force quickly, you can still expecta number of junk telephone calls from political groups and charities, but atleast these groups are banned from using computers to make the calls.andM;The Washington Post reports that the Direct Marketing Association says itsmembers can live with the provisions of this bill which provides a way forconsumers to take legal action against annoying repeat callers.andM;(John McCormick/19911129)</TEXT></DOC>
