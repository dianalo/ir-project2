One of mine is an inability togracefully comfort the sick, or to bring even a few moments of relief from thepain and boredom which engulf their dreary lives. In fact, it seems that veryoften my presence contributes to the significant decline of the patient,although I'm told that he or she will often rally noticeably the moment Ileave the room.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BEING A GOOD HOSPITAL VISITOR IS NO EASYOPERATION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cowherd is a columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Until then, however, our visits are marked by nervous remarks about theweather followed by long, awkward silences, until the patient finally pats myhand and says softly: &quot;Why don't we see what's on TV?&quot;;    Some people knowinstinctively what to bring the hospitalized patient: a nice basket of fruit,perhaps, or a good book. Whereas my choice of gifts tends to run towardpruning shears or cans of Quaker State motor oil, particularly 10W40 grade,for some reason.;    &quot;You can't go wrong giving the Big Q,&quot; I used to tell mywife. &quot;Remember, all these people drive cars when they're not stuck in a sickbed with i.v. lines snaking from their arms.&quot; But she convinced me thatinstead of bringing two or three cans to the patient's room in a largeTru-Value bag, the cans could be left discreetly in that person's garage alongwith a nice get-well note that says: &quot;Works best if changed every 3,000miles.&quot;;    Another problem I have involves discussing the exact nature of thepatient's illness. Some visitors do this well, adopting a breezy tone andtalking about, say, a patient's prostate as if they were discussing nothingmore annoying than an errant valve on the dishwasher.;    Me, I tend to get alittle bit more, um, involved. For instance, if the person has had his or hergall bladder removed, I'll often find myself choking back sobs and moaning:&quot;What kind of a life is that with no gall bladder? Why go on when you can'teven process bile entering the gastrointestinal tract?&quot;;    Of course, thistype of behavior is completely out of line. Obviously it brings no comfort tothe patient, nor does the subsequent commotion when security is summoned andthe well-meaning visitor is dragged kicking and screaming into the hallway bytwo thugs in paramilitary garb and told, in explicit fashion, never to darkenthe patient's door again.;    Not that this ever happened to me. But you hearthings.;    As trying as the role of the visitor is, though, it pales incomparison to the rigors of being a patient.;    Instead of being allowed torest or whimper softly in pain, patients are expected to put on brave facesand -- this gets me -- actually entertain visitors.;    This entertainment isexpected to take the form of amusing anecdotes about &quot;hospital life&quot; (theawful food, the former Hitler Youth Corps member who's your nurse, etc.) andupbeat announcements on the patient's status. (&quot;Oh, I'm doing fine, for aperson with no pancreas.&quot;);    My God, what a terrible burden this is for asick person! Each time you open your eyes, three or four moon-faced,damp-browed people are hovering over your bed, thrusting stale zucchini breadin your face and asking you to recite for the umpteenth time exactly whathappened when your appendix burst and you passed out at the wheel of your car,which eventually plunged into that secluded ravine where you remained pinnedunder the rear bumper until discovered by a grizzled old miner riding aburro.;    Hoo, boy. No wonder a coyote will bite off its own injured legrather than alert the rest of the pack to his plight.;    Some tips forvisiting a sick person:;    If you arrive when the patient is watching&quot;Geraldo!,&quot; do not snort derisively, snatch the channel changer and say: &quot;Thisis probably what made you sick in the first place.&quot;;    If the heavilybandaged patient in the next bed is moaning, do not inquire loudly: &quot;What'shis problem?&quot;;    Do not hog all the ice water, or make loud cracking soundswhile chewing the ice. This will so annoy the patient that he will struggleout of bed and hurl himself through the nearest open window to the courtyardbelow.;    By keeping a watchful eye on the newspapers and supermarketcirculars, one can often find good sales on motor oil.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Kevin Cowherd column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910607  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  761  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 7, 199100159076,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
