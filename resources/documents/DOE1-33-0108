The data illustrating highspatial-time variability of the ionosphere which complicates sufficientlythe search for regularities of its behaviour are presented. Comparativeanalysis of the data from the ''Venera-15, 16'' satellites and resultsof the ''Venera-9, -10'' and the ''Pioneer-Venera'' stations shows thatcharacteristics of high-altitude profiles of electron concentration changewith the phase of 11-year cycle of solar activity. Numerical simulationof the experiment is used to consider sensitivity of the method of dual-frequencyradiowave sounding as applied to investigation of the upper nightsideVenus ionosphere. Results of numerical simulation testify to the fact,that radio occultation data don't enable due to restricted sensitivityof the method to make a conclusion about the presence or absence of thestretched plasma region on the venus nightside for low solar activity.They only testify to the fact that electron concentration in plasma taildoesn't exceed 10/sup 3/ cm/sup -3/ on the average.</TEXT></DOC>
