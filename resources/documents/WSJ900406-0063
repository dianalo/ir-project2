The agreement was revealed in a proposed order submittedto U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter in New York City lastweek. The forfeitures will have to be paid only if theconvictions of the six defendants in the case are upheld onappeal.</LP><TEXT>   The potent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizationslaw, or RICO, requires convicted defendants to forfeit theirprofits from alleged wrongdoing, plus interest, as well astheir salaries during the period of wrongdoing and theirstake in what the law calls a &quot;racketeering enterprise.&quot;   Last July, a federal jury returned guilty verdicts againstfive officials of Princeton/Newport and a former DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. trader on multiple felony countsrelating to securities fraud, conspiracy and racketeering.The jury determined that the defendants should forfeit assetstotaling $3.8 million, far less than the $21.7 million thegovernment sought. At the time, the government vowed it wouldappeal the forfeiture verdict because it was too low.   But when he sentenced the defendants in November, JudgeCarter ordered a total of $1.6 million in forfeitures fromtwo of the six defendants. He dismissed the forfeituressought by the government against most of the defendantsbecause, he said, &quot;the benefits the defendants received weregreatly disproportionate to the penalty,&quot; in violation of theEighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.   Since the Princeton/Newport defendants were convicted, theJustice Department has issued new guidelines urgingprosecutors not to seek disproportionate penalties or tobring RICO charges in a case involving mostly tax offenses.In the Princeton/Newport case, most of the offenses weretax-related.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Cartucsciello said thesettlement didn't indicate any weakening of the government'sposition. &quot;The settlement is a settlement, not an admission,&quot;he said, adding, &quot;The defendants originally said they shouldpay nothing.&quot; The government also agreed to remove priorrestraining orders on the defendants' assets soon.   But Jack Arseneault, a defense lawyer in the case,disagreed. &quot;This is not only less than the government askedfor, but less than the jury awarded,&quot; he said. While Mr.Arseneault acknowledged that lawyers argued that defendantsshouldn't have to pay anything, he said, &quot;We compromised moreout of practicality than out of an admission that anyforfeiture is appropriate.&quot; Mr. Arseneault said thedefendants agreed to the compromise because many haddifficulty living with restraints on their assets.   Under the agreement, James Sutton Regan, the formermanaging partner of Princeton/Newport, will forfeit$2,367,645 if his conviction is upheld on appeal. FormerPrinceton/Newport general partners Jack Z. Rabinowitz,Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman will forfeit $157,843each. Steven B. Smotrich, the defunct securities firm'sformer comptroller, will forfeit $983, and Bruce L. Newberg,a former Drexel trader who did business withPrinceton/Newport will forfeit $157,843.   ---   LIBEL SUIT against Glamour Magazine may be allowed toproceed.   Eric A. Foretich, former husband of Elizabeth Morgan, suedGlamour and others, alleging that a Glamour article left theimpression that he had sexually abused their daughter Hilary,as Dr. Morgan claims.   Conde Nast Publications Inc., which publishes Glamour,author Bob Trebilcock and others at the company also aredefendants in the suit, in which Dr. Foretich and his parentsseek $40 million in compensatory damages and $200 million inpunitive damages. Conde Nast is part of the Newhousepublishing empire.   In a decision this week, U.S. District Judge GerhardGesell of Washington, D.C., said Dr. Foretich's libel suitwas barred because it was filed more than one year afterpublication of the November 1988 article. But Judge Gesellsaid Dr. Foretich can proceed with the suit if he can showthat the magazine gave permission to supporters of Dr. Morganto copy and distribute the article, as Dr. Foretich contends.Under libel law, subsequent re-publications of the samematerial are considered new publications.   Dr. Morgan became the center of widespread media attentionwhen she spent 25 months in jail for civil contempt afterrefusing to produce Hilary for a two-week unsupervised visitwith her ex-husband.   Dr. Morgan has claimed that Dr. Foretich sexually abusedHilary, a charge he denies. A judge said the evidence wasinconclusive about whether abuse had occurred.   ---   WESTERN UNION LOSES challenge to gay-discrimination law.   California Superior Court Judge Ira Brown rejected thecompany's efforts to declare the 13-year-old San Franciscoordinance, the first of its kind in the nation, invalid underCalifornia's constitution. Judge Brown also rejected WesternUnion's claim that cities don't have the power to givevictims the right to sue for damages over wrongful conduct,such as job discrimination.   Western Union asked the judge to declare the law invalidafter the company was sued by Armand Ertag, a former employeewho claimed he was harassed on the job by a supervisor.Melvin Honowitz, Mr. Ertag's lawyer, said the decision clearsthe way for the case to be addressed on its merits. Mr. Ertagis suing for damages for lost compensation, emotionaldistress and invasion of privacy.   A Western Union spokesman said the Upper Saddle River,N.J., company had planned to withdraw its challenge to theordinance this week before it learned of the judge'sdecision.   &quot;What we had here was really a narrow legal issue, whichwe offered as a defense,&quot; the spokesman said. The legaltactic, however, created &quot;a widespread reaction that thecompany discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation.That is absolutely not the case,&quot; he said.   Western Union's actions in the case spurred a boycott bysome gay-rights organizations. The Human Rights Campaign Fundin Washington, D.C., for instance, canceled a contract thatit estimated would have given the company $350,000 in revenuethis year. A group of gay and lesbian San Francisco cityemployees plans to file a complaint with the city's HumanRights Commission asking that the city government beprohibited from doing business with the ailing communicationscompany.   ---   DIGGES SENTENCED: Edward S. Digges Jr., theproduct-liability defense specialist who pleaded guilty inJanuary to stealing more than $2 million from a formerclient, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison. The scion ofone of Maryland's most wealthy and prominent legal families,Mr. Digges, 44 years old, faced as much as three years injail for padding legal bills and submitting phony invoices.Mr. Digges apologized for the theft, saying he is only nowbeginning to understand his behavior. A psychiatristtestified that Mr. Digges suffers from a &quot;narcissisticpersonality disorder&quot; that made him unable to comprehend themagnitude of his crime. U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrovein Baltimore sentenced Mr. Digges to probation for threeyears upon his release and ordered him to pay $1 million inrestitution and $30,000 in fines. Mr. Digges is to report toprison May 7.   ---   JUDICATE, the nation's oldest private court system, hiredStephen D. Edenbaum, a former IBM sales executive, to headits national sales division. The move is another step inJudicate's efforts to shift from advertising and promotingits private-mediation service to direct sales through phonecalls and presentations. Lackluster performance sinceJudicate introduced its private alternativedispute-resolution service in 1983 forced the company to layoff marketing staff and impose across the board salary cutsin August. The company has yet to turn a profit, but newemphasis on sales, said Theodore A. Schwartz, Judicate's headof investor relations, is already paying off.</TEXT></DOC>
