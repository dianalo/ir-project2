Three construction trailers and a van, parked on the sidewalk onin the street adjacent to the site, tumbled into the cavity at 14thand H Streets Northwest, two blocks north of the National PressClub and four blocks from the White House, fire officials said.   Fire Chief Ray Alfred told reporters, ``We think we may haveseen some movement in the hole'' with a device designed to detectbody heat.   But it was not certain that anyone was trapped. Alfred said anemployee of the contractor told firefighters he was the last personto leave the site.   Special teams were readied to descend into the hole on ropes asofficials sought to determine whether the site was vulnerable tofurther collapse.   The Fire Department ordered the evacuation of an office buildingnext to the excavation containing the headquarters of United PressInternational, said department spokesman Ted Holmes.   ``There is still some movement'' of soil, Holmes said, pointingto a fire hydrant next to the eacuated building.   The subsurface pipe feeding the hydrant was bare. But until11:20 p.m., nearly three hours after the cave-in, the pipe had beensurrounded with earth.   The square excavation appeared to be about 30 yards on a sideand workers said it was four stories deep. Darkness and thedistance spectators were kept from the site prevented detailedobservation of the rubble inside.   Fire officials said the 8:30 p.m. cave-in apparently was set offby the vibrations of a faulty transformer, whose spectacular arcingcould be seen for blocks.   ``It lit up the whole sky,'' said one construction worker, whowould not give his name.   Service was suspended on a subway line running past the area,with trains turning back at nearby stations on either side. Buseswere called to carry passengers between the Metro Center andFarragut West stations.   The subway line was in no danger, officials. Rather they fearedthe effect of vibrations from passing trains.   One man was killed in another cave-in at the site earlier thisyear.</TEXT></DOC>
