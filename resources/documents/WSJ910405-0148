John W. Snow, chairman, president and chief executiveofficer of the Richmond, Va., transportation company, saidimproved productivity on the railroad helped offset a 10%drop in rail freight traffic. Sea-Land Service Inc., thecompany's ocean shipping unit, had strong first-quarterresults, and earnings at CSX's inland barge unit were aboutflat despite a big shortfall in grain shipments, he said.</LP><TEXT>   Other income at CSX was a little higher in the latestquarter, and the company's interest expense and tax rate wereslightly lower.   In the year-earlier first quarter, CSX had net income of$77 million, or 76 cents a share, after a restructuringcharge of $33 million and a gain of $52 million from disposalof a unit. Excluding the nonrecurring items, CSX earned $58million in the quarter. Mr. Snow estimated first-quarter 1991revenue as &quot;flat to slightly up,&quot; compared with $1.91 billiona year earlier.   Mr. Snow said coal tonnage was off about 10% in the firstquarter, reflecting unusually mild winter weather. If theweather had been closer to normal, &quot;we would have had agangbusters first quarter,&quot; he said.   For all of 1991, Mr. Snow expects net to be &quot;roughly flat&quot;with the $416 million, or $4.15 a share, reported for 1990after nonrecurring items. &quot;I'd be disappointed if we weren'tover $4 a share despite the economy,&quot; Mr. Snow said. &quot;If wedo that, it will be a tremendous accomplishment, because it'sa lot tougher to improve earnings in a period of fallingcarloads and generalized economic weakness.&quot;   Mr. Snow didn't speculate on the cost to CSX if railunions go on strike against the railroad industry at 12:01a.m. April 17, when an emergency cooling-off period ends. Hesaid he is &quot;hopeful, but not confident&quot; that the railindustry will be able to reach agreement with some railunions before then. If the unions strike, CSX would be ableto operate 25% to 50% of its rail service for some time withsupervisory employees and retirees, Mr. Snow said.   Mr. Snow acknowledged that CSX had been distracted inrecent years by forays into unrelated fields followed bysales of assets in resorts, energy and fiber-optic cables.&quot;That sort of thing is traumatic in a big company,&quot; said Mr.Snow, adding that employee morale is improving now that thecompany is clearly focused on freight transportation. &quot;I'vetried to settle all that down,&quot; he said.   CSX is paying closer attention to operating details at itsrail unit, which was once regarded as among the leastefficient in its industry. Mr. Snow said the companycontinues to improve its safety performance, freight car andlocomotive utilization and other productivity measures. Forexample, Mr. Snow said, employee injuries reportable in thefirst quarter to the Federal Railroad Administration droppedabout 50% from 502 a year earlier. Although he said he wasunable to quantify cost savings from the reduced injury rate,he noted that the average reportable injury in 1990 cost thecompany $43,000.   The railroad also reduced its fuel consumption 10% in thefirst quarter, reflecting lower traffic levels, the use ofnew fuel-efficient locomotives and adoption of a pacingprogram that has reduced running speeds of most freighttrains to 40 miles per hour from 50 mph. Mr. Snow said thecompany has sought to compensate for the lower train speedsby streamlining operations in freight yards.   He said a $40 million reduction in the railroad'sfirst-quarter operating expenses resulting from productivityand safety gains significantly offset a $60 million, or 5%,decline in rail revenue. The rail unit's pretax operatingincome fell to about $135 million in the first quarter from$155 million in the year-earlier period.   &quot;They are doing a better job of running the railroad,&quot;said Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Co. &quot;Theiron-time performance and safety have improved dramatically.&quot;   Mr. Snow said the rail unit is gradually adjusting itsunusual alignment of management responsibilities into threeparts. The management structure, created several years ago,produced some benefits but led to conflicts and confusion,according to some CSX managers. &quot;There have been so manyrefinements and modifications to the old three-unitstructure, it wouldn't be recognized today,&quot; he said.   Mr. Snow said the company's contract with the Kuwaitgovernment to provide logistics support services for thecountry's emergency relief program &quot;won't dramaticallychange&quot; its revenue in the quarter or the short term. He saidCSX's logistics unit in Alexandria, Va., is arrangingshipment and distribution of emergency supplies, includingpotable water, medicine, machinery and fire engines, but hesaid a &quot;relatively small fraction is being handled on our owncarriers.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
