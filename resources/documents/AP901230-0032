Eighteen protesters were wounded in clashes with troops in GazaCity, Arab reports said.   In another development, Labor Party leader Shimon Peres onSunday denied reports that Israeli officials have spoken withPalestinians about granting autonomy to the Gaza Strip.   The report Saturday from Amman, attributed to PLO officials,said Peres and other Israelis had met a Palestinian official andSaudi businessman last week in Paris about the autonomy idea.   ``It has no basis,'' a spokeswoman for Peres, Bahira Bardugo,said in a telephone interview.   In the occupied West Bank, one Arab died Sunday in a clashbetween Palestinian collaborators and Arab activists. ThreePalestinians suspected of being collaborators with Israel fired onstone-throwing Arab activists in the town of Yaabad, Arab and mediareports said.   Killed in the shooting was Rabiya Hamarshe, 26, the reportssaid. The army confirmed that an Arab was killed by a fellowPalestinian in Yaabad.   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Manar Bakir, 19, was killed byan explosive near the military headquarters, Arab reports said. Thearmy command confirmed the incident and said the youth died when anexplosive device he was preparing went off.   Curfews were clamped on Nablus and Ya'bad following theviolence.   Israel also imposed the curfews in the Gaza Strip to preventviolence after the clashes Saturday with soldiers - the worst inGaza in more than six months. In Rafah, where Saturday's violencebegan, streets covered with stones were deserted except for armypatrols and one burning tire.   Arab merchants staged a commercial strike throughout the WestBank to protest Saturday's bloodshed. In Nablus, masked activistsmarched during the night brandishing pistols, automatic weapons andposters of PLO chief Yasser Arafat.   Military officials attributed the tensions to the 26thanniversary of the founding of the PLO's mainstream Fatah guerrillamovement on Tuesday.   The military government closed all schools in the West Bank fortwo weeks beginning Monday to ward off any riots marking theanniversary, Arab reports said.   Military government spokesman Shmuel Ozenboy said that theschools were shut for winter vacation, but Arab reporters said thevacation had been planned for the middle of January.   The Israeli military defended soldiers' actions in the GazaStrip on Saturday, saying they opened fire only when their liveswere in danger.   The riots began when two masked Arabs were shot dead in Rafahafter refusing orders from troops to halt, and another twoPalestinians were killed as soldiers dispersed stone and firebombthrowers in the area, Arab and army reports said later.   The army said a woman initially listed as a riot fatality turnedout to have had a heart attack. Arab reports said 194 people werewounded while army counts put the number at 90.   The killing in Yaabad on Sunday brought to 323 the number ofPalestinians slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion ofcollaborating with Israel.   At least 785 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops orcivilians in the uprising. Fifty-seven Israelis have also beenslain in the violence.   Also Sunday, the body of an Israeli man was found with histhroat cut in his apartment in the northern port city of Haifa.   City police commander Yossi Levy told Israel radio he suspecteda political motive in the slaying of Yossi Malchin, 60, but thatother motives were being checked.   Israel army radio reported later that his adopted Arab son hadbeen detained.</TEXT></DOC>
