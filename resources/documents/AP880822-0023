The amount, compiled from required reports filed with the Houseand Senate, represented a 4.5 percent increase from 1986, when amassive overhaul of the nation's income tax laws spurred bigspending by registered lobbyists.   The 1986 total of $60.87 million by some 8,500 individuals andorganizations was up from $49 million in 1985 and at the time wasthe highest total since The Associated Press began compiling thefigures in 1983.   The National Committee to Preserve Social Security led the packlast year with a reported outlay of $2.93 million, much of it fordirect-mail campaigns designed to flood congressional offices withletters from senior citizens.   Headed by James Roosevelt, the son of President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt, the organization has drawn fire from members of Congresswho say it uses scare tactics to obtain contributions from theelderly.   Roosevelt has defended the lobbying group, saying ``our cause isa good one, our methods are honest, our concerns are sincere.''   The $2.93 million was slightly below the $3 million in lobbyingexpenses reported by the group for 1986, when it finished in secondplace behind the $3.02 million spent by Citizens for SensibleControl of Acid Rain.   That group, bankrolled principally by electric utilities andcoal companies, decreased its 1987 lobbying expenses to $1.2million, leaving it in eighth place among nine organizationsspending more than $1 million last year.   Second spot in 1987 was occupied by perennial big-spender CommonCause, the self-described citizens lobby that concentrates ongovernment ethics and election finance reform and attributes itsentire budget to lobbying.   Common Cause spent $2.56 million last year, just ahead of the$2.55 million reported by a tobacco company, Philip Morris USA,which used direct-mail campaigns to oppose any increase in federalexcise taxes on tobacco products.   Philip Morris spent about half its total in the final quarter of1987. Its fourth-quarter outlay of $1.27 million was the highest byany lobbying group for a three-month period last year.   The Committee to Protect the Family ranked fourth in overallspending last year with $1.95 million, followed by Sierra Club's$1.5 million to support lobbying on environment and conservationissues.   The biggest spender among organized labor last year was theNational Association of Letter Carriers at $1.48 million. The othermillion-plus spenders were the Fiber Fabric and Apparel Coalitionfor Trade with $1.24 million and the Home Recording RightsCoalition with nearly $1.18 million.   The coalition, a consortium of audio component companies, hasbeen battling on Capitol Hill for several years against theRecording Industry Association of America, composed of record andtape manufacturers.   The coalition's spending was far ahead of the $331,280 reportedby the recording association in the struggle over whether Congresswill restrict use of or impose royalty fees on digital audio tape,the newest kid on the high-fidelity block.   The continuing congressional debate over handgun control againaccounted for heavy lobbying expenses, with a group pushing forfirearms restrictions, Handgun Control Inc., leading spending inthis area with $900,343.   The pro-control forces were outgunned, however, by collectivespending by their opponents: National Rifle Association of America,$668,058; Gun Owners of America, $608,672; and Citizens Committeefor the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, $271,435.   Other large spenders last year included American PetroleumInstitute, $919,419; Project Cure, $909,018; Free the Eagle,$896,555; Railway Labor Executives' Association, $800,293; RainbowLobby, $765,329; and U.S. League of Savings Institutions, $728,803.   Also, AFL-CIO, $576,504; American Israel Public AffairsCommittee, $543,273; United Auto Workers, $539,451; Man-Made FiberProducers Association Inc., $524,642; American Council of LifeInsurance Inc., $513,281; and American Farm Bureau Federation,$512,671.   Also, American Arts Alliance, $504,098; National Association ofHome Builders of the U.S., $490,062; American Bankers Association,$476,707; National Association of Realtors, $440,141; Air TransportAssociation of America, $412,175; and Disabled American Veterans,$405,168.</TEXT></DOC>
