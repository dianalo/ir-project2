Six months ago, the collapse of a proposed deal to takeover UAL Corp. battered the already shakymerger-and-acquisition business. It also sent the Dow JonesIndustrial Average plunging more than 190 points to 2569.26on Oct. 13, 1989, effectively eliminating what many analyststermed &quot;the merger premium&quot; built into stock prices.</LP><TEXT>   Since then the deal business has remained depressed. Datacompiled by Birinyi Associates, a stock-market strategy firm,show that the value of mergers and acquisitions announced inthe first quarter of 1990 totaled $12.5 billion, down from$23.3 billion a year ago, and $68.5 billion in the firstquarter of 1988.   Yet in the six months since the UAL debacle, the Dow hit anew high, slipped again, and now stands at 2717.12; that iswithin 93 points of its record high of 2810.15, an overalldecline of less than 3%.   No one is claiming this is a roaring bull market. But thefact that stock prices are holding their own while takeoverdeals have seemingly disappeared does give some analysts abit more confidence in the U.S. stock market.   &quot;Deals were one of the two principal sources of capitalfor the financial markets in 1988 and 1989,&quot; says HughJohnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. &quot;Forus to be able to hold together as well as we have is prettyimpressive.&quot;   One reason stock prices haven't collapsed, he points out,is that while the high-profile leveraged buy-outs andacquisitions that drew so much attention in 1988 and 1989have virtually disappeared, corporations still are buying upstock through stock buy-backs. He cites Federal Reserve datathat show corporations purchased shares at the annual rate of$143.33 billion for the first three quarters of 1989, andthat those purchases continued at a $93 billion annual ratein the fourth quarter of 1989, the latest period for whichthe Federal Reserve provides data.   &quot;The point is, while corporations are certainly buying alot less stock, they're still buying,&quot; Mr. Johnson says.&quot;Corporate stock purchases didn't just disappear.&quot;   Beyond that, Mr. Johnson points out that foreigninvestors, the other big source of capital in 1988 and 1989,are still putting their money into U.S. financial markets.Indeed, he contends that the troubles afflicting the Japanesestock market since the beginning of this year are giving U.S.stocks and bonds a boost as international portfolio managersdivert money away from Japan and into the U.S. and WestGermany.   Although there isn't yet solid data to support thiscontention, Mr. Johnson cites the dollar's increasingstrength against the Japanese yen as evidence that funds areflowing this way. And while much of that money is aimed atthe U.S. bond market, it indirectly bolsters the stock marketby producing lower interest rates than would otherwise be thecase.   &quot;If you help the bond market, you help the stock market,&quot;he says.   New money from individual investors, much of it funneledinto the stock market through mutual funds, also has helpedoffset the decline of corporate stock purchases in the pastsix months. For the first nine months of 1989, mutual fundswere net sellers of stock at an annual rate of $5.8 billion.But in the fourth quarter of 1989, just as corporate stockpurchases were slackening, mutual funds were net purchasersof stock to the tune of $22.4 billion on an annualized basis.   Finally, the first quarter of 1990 brought a modest upturnin the economy, effectively allaying fears among manyinvestors that the U.S. was headed for a recession. Theprospect that corporate profits later this year will reflectthe modest rebound in the economy is bolstering stock prices,especially in the so-called cyclical stocks that move withthe economic cycle.   Yet while Mr. Johnson is encouraged that those variousprops are supporting stock prices, he cautions that if one ormore of the props falls away, prices could fall, too.   &quot;If for some reason or another mutual funds don't like theoutlook or the Japanese market stabilizes, we might not getthe kind of nourishment we need from that money flowing intothe market,&quot; he says. &quot;That makes it kind of a risky period.&quot;   And some analysts argue that the Dow industrials don'treally reflect what has happened to the broader stock marketfollowing the slump in takeover deals. The broader market iswhere the loss of the &quot;merger premium&quot; has been felt themost, they say.   &quot;The Dow may be at 2700, but to conclude that the rest ofthe market has come back that far is an illusion,&quot; saysSuresh Bhirud, chief portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer.&quot;You can look at the Dow and say it hasn't been a bad marketsince last October, but if you're running a broad portfolioof stocks, you've been in more or less a bear market.&quot; Inparticular, he points to the Nasdaq over-the-counter index,which has lost some 15% since last October.   Mr. Bhirud says the big problem with the merger boom in1988 and 1989 is that it persuaded many investors to abandonconservative forms of stock valuation based on earnings infavor of such methods as &quot;breakup value&quot; and &quot;price to cashflow ratios.&quot;   &quot;If you look at the market prior to Oct. 13, you'll findat least a couple of dozen stocks that were rumored to betakeover targets selling at 20 to 30 times earnings,&quot; hesays. &quot;Those kinds of values were not really justified exceptunder some immensely rosy circumstances.&quot;   And investors who chased some of the stocks that weresupposedly targets of takeover attempts last year have beenburned this year. Birinyi Associates compiled an index ofspeculative stocks, including such names as USX, Hilton, Meadand Unisys, that were the targets of takeovers that werenever consummated. So far this year, the index is down 11.9%.   &quot;That tells us that investors have to be a little moredisciplined,&quot; says Mr. Birinyi. &quot;It isn't going to pay to bean ambulance chaser.&quot;   Joseph A. Feshbach, Prudential-Bache's chief technicalstock-market analyst for six years, has been hired byShearson Lehman Hutton. He is related to, but unconnectedwith, the Feshbach brothers of Palo Alto, Calif., well-knownshortsellers who aim to profit from stock price declines. HisPrudential-Bache market comment Wednesday said the &quot;nexttest&quot; for the industrial average will be 2600. &quot;All the trendmeasures are extremely negative,&quot; he said, citing a&quot;breakdown in the Dow Jones Utility Index&quot; and &quot;extremelyhigh over-the-counter volume&quot; compared with Big Board volume.But he expects &quot;good support&quot; when the industrial averagehits 2580 to 2600.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Stock prices drifted lower in slow trading as investorscontinued to dump regional bank stocks and other issuesconsidered vulnerable to earnings problems.   The latest bout of selling came after the March employmentreport provided an indication of possible weakness in theeconomy -- a rise in nonfarm payrolls that was considerablysmaller than expected.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.05 to 2717.12,but managed to record a gain for the week of 9.91 points.Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.65 to 340.08while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.37to 186.78 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 0.78 to316.62.   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 137,490,000shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead ofadvancers 860 to 622.   The employment data, released before the opening, showedthat payrolls rose just 26,000 last month -- well below theconsensus forecast of a Dow Jones Capital Markets survey ofeconomists, which projected an increase of 178,000. Thejobless rate fell 0.1 point, to 5.2%.   Although economists said the report eased concerns thatthe Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy in order tokeep inflation under control, a round of sell programsresulting from stock-index arbitrage sent prices lower inearly trading. The selloff in regional banks' shares thenregained momentum, keeping pressure on the broad market.   The sector's downturn began Thursday, when analysts turnednegative on the group after meeting with federal bankingregulators who indicated that the companies face extensivereviews of their loan portfolios.   Banks are expected to begin reporting first-quarterresults this week, and the tough talk on loans has spurredexpectations that the banks' lending problems will translateinto weak earnings.   PNC Financial, which estimated that its nonperformingassets rose about 43% during the first quarter, plunged 3 7/8to 34. Because of an increase in its provision for loanlosses, the concern said it expects to report net income forthe quarter fell 35% to 40% from the year-ago quarter.   Bank of New York fell 1 1/4 to 30 as 1.4 million shareschanged hands. Other regional bank stocks that were hit withselling included NCNB, which dropped 3/4 to 35 3/8; NationalCity, which fell 1 1/4 to 33 3/8; Mellon Bank, down 1 1/8 to24 1/8; Citizens andamp; Southern, down 5/8 to 24 5/8; SovranFinancial, down 5/8 to 32, and Signet Banking, down 1 1/4 to23.   Fears of shaky loans also sent Federal National MortgageAssociation, the most active Big Board issue, retreating 25/8 to 32 on 3.7 million shares. First Boston cut itsestimate of 1990 earnings slightly, citing its belief that awidening of the difference between its loan rates and itsborrowing costs has peaked. Meanwhile, Federal Home LoanMortgage fell 3 1/2 to 65 1/4.   Shares of big commercial banks closed mixed. Citicorp rose3/8 to 22 7/8, Chase Manhattan slid 1/4 to 27 5/8,Manufacturers Hanover added 3/8 to 31 1/8, BankAmerica fell7/8 to 25 1/2, Chemical Banking slid 1/8 to 22 7/8 and J.P.Morgan lost 3/8 to 34 5/8.   Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 3/8 to 62 on 1.4 millionshares, contributing to the decline in the Dow industrials,as analysts at Prudential-Bache Securities and First Bostonmade unfavorable comments on aluminum stocks. Reynolds Metalsdropped 5/8 to 53 1/2 after Prudential-Bache cut its estimateof the company's first-quarter earnings.   The technology sector, which has already delivered somedisappointing earnings estimates for the first quarter, camein for some selling as well. International Business Machineseased 1/4 to 105 7/8, Digital Equipment fell 1 1/4 to 78 1/2,Compaq Computer declined 7/8 to 96 1/8, Hewlett-Packarddeclined 1 1/8 to 43 3/4 and Motorola fell 3/4 to 65 1/8.   UAL dropped 2 to 163 1/2 even though its board agreed inprinciple to a buy-out bid, valued at $201 a share, from agroup of unions at its United Airlines subsidiary. The unionssaid they are contributing $2 billion of labor concessions tothe offer -- but no cash -- and haven't yet obtained anyoutside financing.   Browning-Ferris Industries, which put its hazardouswaste-disposal business up for sale, climbed 1 1/2 to 36 7/8as 1.8 million shares changed hands. The company said itsresults for the March quarter would include a charge of $295million related to the pullout.</TEXT></DOC>
