In 1988, 500,000 cases of viruses were reported,most of them originating in microcomputers.andP;  In the first threemonths of 1989, the figure was 400,000 and counting.andP;  Although amainframe virus has yet to be reported, worms, or virus-like codesthat can move between systems without help, have already beendocumented as having attacked mainframes and minicomputers.andO;Viruses and worms will not thrive in the mainframe environmentmainly because they will probably not reach it.andP;  Mostmicrocomputer viruses are passed along unknowingly by people whoshare software and computers.andP;  Mainframes are not communal innature, and potential virus carriers seldom have access to them.andO;Mainframe viruses would have to be bigger, more complex, anddesigned specifically to attack the security shell.andP;  The prospectis possible, but not very likely.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer VirusesMainframe ComputersSecurityData SecurityComputer Crimes.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographtable.andO;Caption:   Virus-related definitions.
