This convention marks a major step toward the suburbanization of the Democratic Party. In Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen -- one a tomato-planting Mr. Suburbia, the other a landed Texas aristocrat -- the party presents the nation a ticket that seems more at home on a manicured lawn than in a grimy union hall.    &quot;Suburbia is where the battle will be fought well into the next century,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Robert Matsui of California. &quot;And Mike Dukakis is the new breed of Democrat we need. You can imagine him in your neighbor's back yard, barbecuing hamburgers.&quot;    By suburbia, Democrats don't mean Chicago's North Shore or even Mr. Dukakis's own affluent hometown of Brookline, Mass. They mean working-class and middle-class suburbs like Parma, Ohio, and Fremont, Calif. -- places where family incomes range from $25,000 to $50,000. Here, families cling tenuously to the middle-class good life, often only because both husband and wife hold jobs.    Ronald Reagan made major inroads in such communities, and winning back their voters, says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, could mean &quot;the difference between 42% and 52%&quot; -- that is, the difference between a Republican landslide and a Dukakis victory.    This convention's cool, calculated appeal to the swing voters of the center -- to &quot;a republic of property owners,&quot; as a political analyst describes the people who decide elections now -- already has embittered Jesse Jackson. It bothers some other Democrats too. They fear the party is trading its soul for a hand-held calculator.    &quot;We've gone from visionaries to functionaries,&quot; grouses George Cunningham, a longtime George McGovern aide. &quot;Walter Mondale was probably the last of the secondhand visionaries, a secondhand Hubert Humphrey. Now we're into managers. Dukakis, like Mussolini, is going to make the trains run on time. But who cares?&quot;    The dominant message this convention hopes to send the country isn't ideological, but rather cultural. That message stresses competence over compassion, stability over social experimentation. It scarcely talks of taxing the haves to help the have-nots. The overriding goal is to reassure and reach out to the middle class.    Deep, substantive political differences will divide Michael Dukakis and George Bush this fall. In terms of style, though, voters &quot;may be choosing between Calvin Coolidge and Calvin Coolidge,&quot; quips Democratic political analyst Alan Baron.    This is a party in transition, in the midst of a precarious balancing act. It can't win without strong support from its historic constituencies: the minorities, the poor, the unionized. But it will almost certainly lose if it can't go beyond them. Four years ago, Walter Mondale swept 91% of the black vote, 64% of voters with a gradeschool education and 57% of the union family vote -- and lost 49 of 50 states.    &quot;It's the aspiring middle that decides elections now,&quot; says executive director Alvin From of the Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group formed in response to the Mondale smash-up. &quot;And the aspiring middle lives in suburbia.&quot;    &quot;Democrats are redefining themselves as a party that helps the middle class as well as the underclass -- not the underclass at the expense of the middle class,&quot; concludes University of Michigan political scientist Gregory Markus.    &quot;We've learned the most important lesson,&quot; says Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin. &quot;We need to be committed to growth, rather than to redistribution.&quot;    That is a lesson from Ronald Reagan. Now the Democrats must do battle on political terrain profoundly reshaped by nearly eight years of Reaganomics and social conservatism.    &quot;Reagan has won the big battle,&quot; concedes House Majority Whip Tony Coelho. &quot;We're still fighting on his ground.&quot; But he adds: &quot;We've gone through a reality test, and we've passed it.&quot;    The realities are stark. The Democrats have lost four of the last five presidential elections, three in utter routs. Unions are in retreat, and working-class voter turnout is steadily eroding. A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology political scientist Walter Dean Burnham estimates that Boston-area working-class turnout plummeted to about 33% in 1984 from 70% in 1964. Meanwhile, the middle-class turnout, already high, rose even higher over the same 20-year period.    So the middle class is where the crucial votes are. Fortunately for the Democrats, as voter loyalties to both parties erode, a big chunk of the middle class is up for grabs. &quot;Who are the swing voters now? Anywhere from 30% to 60% of those in the middle,&quot; says California pollster Mervin Field.    Democratic analysts believe a big chunk of the middle class is also anxious -- feeling vulnerable amid an economy that continues to prosper. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only a narrow majority of middle-income people said they believe that the generation of young people starting out today will achieve as much financially as their parents' generation; more than four in 10 of these people think the younger generation will be worse off.    Party strategists think this anxiety presents a Democratic opening, and that opening is shaping the platform and the speeches here.    &quot;These are people who by all outward appearances look prosperous,&quot; says Mr. From of the Democratic Leadership Council. &quot;Yet they feel themselves living on the margin. 'What if one of us gets sick? What about day care? And how are we ever going to afford college?' There's a sense that the balloon could pop.&quot;    Finally, &quot;Democrats have grown increasingly adept at playing on Republican terrain,&quot; argues Los Angeles political consultant Harold Meyerson. They have learned to tap fat cats for contributions. They have also learned to substitute TV and direct-mail technology for precinct workers.    The question is whether they've abandoned their heritage in the process. Mr. Meyerson thinks they have. In an essay for the journal Dissent, he described the compromises that accompanied Democratic Senate gains in 1986:   &quot;No working-class organization, no voter participation? Fine. We will abandon our historic commitment to the working class, shun populism, ignore the unregistered, raise oodles of money, bend all efforts to winning the enlightened portion of the upper-middle class. And we will win! Well, sometimes.&quot;    But even Mr. Meyerson sees candidate Dukakis as a good choice for this fragile, transitional period in Democratic Party history. A curious hybrid -- a Greek with a Yankee personality -- he may be uniquely suited to bridge the blue collar-white collar chasm.    &quot;For governance, his base would be suburban Democrats. But his Greek dancing, his talk of jobs reaches out for the traditional Democratic base,&quot; says Mr. Meyerson. Ralph Whitehead, a University of Massachusetts professor and political analyst, agrees. &quot;Michael Dukakis is very good at straddling the city limits,&quot; he says.    Mr. Dukakis also has avoided making detailed promises to the gaggle of Democratic pressure groups, thus sidestepping the &quot;pandering&quot; charge that helped sink Walter Mondale in 1984 and would be poison to suburban voters this year. The great accomplishment of the party over the last four years, says the Democratic Leadership Council's Mr. From, is that it now speaks to the electorate as a whole.    Trouble is, it still isn't quite sure what to say. &quot;We've erased the graffiti from the wall,&quot; says Mr. From. &quot;Now we have to paint the mural.&quot;    Democrats here and elsewhere are making a start. One idea mentioned in the draft platform and pushed by the Democratic Leadership Council: In return for voluntary military or civilian service, young people would get vouchers they could use for job training, college tuition or a down payment on a house. The idea reflects traditional American idealism and puts money in the pockets of young people who need it. But most fundamentally, it appeals to a deeply ingrained, conservative American instinct: Government benefits should be earned, not given.    Another idea, also part of the draft platform, is &quot;democratic capitalism.&quot; Today, says a leadership council report, managers see workers as &quot;interchangeable parts . . . disposable drones.&quot; The new approach would give workers more say in plant decisions, greater job security, portable pensions, corporate-provided day care, and perhaps even profit-sharing.    Still another concept, pushed by Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, addresses parental anxiety over soaring college costs. Under his plan, which takes effect Aug. 1 in Michigan this year, parents will be able to invest a pre-arranged amount of money with the state after their child is born; the state, in turn, will guarantee to cover the child's tuition and fees at any of 44 state colleges and universities. The exact amount to be invested will depend on the age of the child. The younger the child, the less the parents will have to invest.    Compared with the titanic, gut-grabbing issues of past Democratic conventions -- civil rights, the Vietnam War -- all this is pretty pallid stuff. Mr. Dukakis, in fact, has been derided as a passionless technocrat who wants to bring the city manager form of government to the White House.    But it could be that cautions, managerial government is exactly what the crucial swing voters are looking for. &quot;The younger and better-educated voters no longer look at government as Big Daddy,&quot; says Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin. &quot;It's a fundamentally different outlook.&quot;    &quot;They want change, but not dramatic change,&quot; says Rep. Coelho. &quot;They're compassionate, but they want to manage that compassion. That's suburbia all the way.&quot;    Mike Dukakis is gambling on suburbia and its swing voters, and on the hope that analysts like Mr. Garin and Rep. Coelho are right. Beaten down by nearly eight years of Reagan rule and the magnitude of the 1984 Mondale disaster, the liberal pressure groups of the Democratic left are in poor position to deflect him from the centrist campaign he intends to run.    But those groups will still be around even if he wins this fall, making demands that a President Dukakis may find hard to meet. And if he loses, they could well be back with a vengeance, plunging the newly centrist Democratic Party right back into an identity crisis. Or maybe a nervous breakdown.    &quot;They will have tried everything: Gone to the left (George McGovern), tried to resurrect the New Deal coalition (Walter Mondale), gone to the center,&quot; says senior fellow A. James Reichley of the Brookings Institution. &quot;If they can't beat George Bush, maybe they ought to try a different country.&quot;    ---                      Outvoted Democrats   Total votes for Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, 1968-1984.
