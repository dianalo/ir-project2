SeibStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FRESTAEROSPACE (ARO)NUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S.-Soviet agreement in principle on their first arms-control treaty since 1979, and unexpected progress by negotiators on a broad range of other issues have raised expectations among officials here of a new, more sober period of detente between the superpowers.    Soviet willingness last week to move forward on several long unresolved issues has convinced U.S. officials that opportunities for improved relations are far better than they had believed. They say Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in his desire to maintain the momentum of his new domestic and foreign policies, clearly has decided he wants to get as much as possible from the conservative Reagan administration rather than waiting to deal with its successor.    U.S. officials believe American disappointment with the 1970s detente, which was accompanied by a Soviet defense buildup and ended with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, will temper U.S. enthusiasm about another possible thaw. However, extreme economic difficulties in the Soviet Union, and the relative failure of the Soviet incursion in Afghanistan make Moscow &quot;less likely to undermine better relations with provocative actions&quot; this time, a Reagan administration official said.    As was widely expected, the two sides last week agreed in principle to a treaty that would ban all intermediate nuclear missiles -- those with ranges between 300 miles and 3,400 miles -- in Europe and Asia. President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev likely will sign the treaty at a Washington summit meeting this fall, probably around Thanksgiving.    What is more surprising is that this relatively limited agreement isn't being viewed anymore as the last U.S.-Soviet accord of the Reagan administration. U.S. officials say the Soviets have shown enough new flexibility over President Reagan's space defense program, called the Strategic Defense Initiative, to raise hopes that the two sides might conclude an agreement on long-range, or strategic, nuclear arms by next spring.    Such a treaty could reduce the number of intercontinental nuclear missiles by 50%. Secretary of State George Shultz said strategic weapons would be &quot;at the center&quot; of talks he will hold with Soviet officials in Moscow in late October.    National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci, speaking yesterday on NBC television's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; said he shared the view of Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) that there is a 50-50 chance the superpowers could agree in principle to a strategic arms pact by the end of President Reagan's term.    The two sides also announced last week agreement to start full-scale negotiations on a stage-by-stage process of reducing nuclear testing, and they signed an agreement to establish nuclear risk reduction centers to minimize the danger of accidental war. Moreover, a senior State Department official said delegations had also made progress on a list of 13 bilateral issues, ranging from a fishery agreement to U.S. grain sales.    For President Reagan, the progress in talks with the Soviets is generally a plus, although he faces a certain fight with his usual supporters over ratification. Many conservative Republicans charge that his administration is going soft on communism during his final months in office. And some moderates, such as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, fear that the president is abandoning Europe and leaving it more vulnerable to Soviet conventional superiority.    Nevertheless, the accord is already helping offset political damage Mr. Reagan suffered in the Iran-Contra affair and bury questions about his leadership that have persisted during the past 10 months. Mr. Reagan will portray the agreement as proof that his plan for building American military strength and waiting out Moscow at the negotiating table has brought important concessions from the Soviets.    The agreement will build Soviet leader Gorbachev's prestige as a decisive player on the world stage and will boost his ability to introduce domestic reforms and expand his international influence. He has clearly taken the initiative in East-West relations, and his flexibility will make Western nations, particularly in Europe, more likely to offer the Soviets trade, credits, better access to Western technology and political support for Mr. Gorbachev's goal of gaining closer relations with such international economic organizations as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    U.S. officials say last week's negotiations leave the superpowers talking about an even broader range of issues than during the heyday of detente. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, at a news conference after his three days of meetings with Mr. Shultz, said the results were &quot;very substantive, a very good material basis for that new period&quot; of detente. &quot;I would say that we have been able to reach as much agreement and as broad an agreement as is possible today,&quot; he said.    Mr. Shultz, for his part, said, &quot;Things have changed tremendously in the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.&quot; He said talks on human rights now were &quot;very worthwhile,&quot; that discussions on regional disputes &quot;have become increasingly rewarding&quot; and that bilateral contacts have increased.    Nevertheless, the nearly complete treaty and the broader warming of relations that accompany it, carry political risk for Mr. Reagan. Administration officials expect a bruising debate in the Senate, although the accord seems likely to be ratified. They doubt they can get conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) and perhaps others like him, to vote for the pact.    The agreement is producing a political paradox among presidential candidates: It is being supported more warmly by Democrats than by President Reagan's fellow Republicans.    The immediate political beneficiary appears to be Vice President George Bush, who strongly backs the accord and can portray himself as a participant in the diplomatic triumph. Other Republican candidates, with an eye to strengthening their support on the right, said they were skeptical or flatly opposed to the pending pact. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, former Delaware Gov. Pierre S. du Pont and the Rev. Pat Robertson all criticized the agreement, generally contending that it leaves Western Europe vulnerable to Soviet conventional forces.    Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.), the Senate minority leader, was more supportive, but he warned that the Senate will look closely at verification provisions.    The American business community, by and large, is likely to welcome the agreement. &quot;We are talking about confidence-building measures of an incredible magnitude,&quot; said Marshall Goldman of Harvard University's Russian Research Center, an expert on U.S.-Soviet economic relations.    Here's what the two sides accomplished during their three days of negotiations last week:    --Intermediate Nuclear Forces. U.S. officials say the agreement is far more important politically -- as the first significant superpower agreement this decade and the beginning of nuclear arms reductions -- than it is militarily. Soviet intercontinental weapons with ranges above those of the missiles that will be removed will cover targets previously taken by the SS-20 missiles that will be removed. The U.S. also has air-launched Cruise missiles, submarine-launched Cruise missiles and bombers that maintain the nuclear deterrent in Europe.    The agreement nevertheless will remove 364 nuclear warheads on U.S. Pershing II and Cruise missiles from Europe, compared with 1,435 warheads on Soviet SS-20 and SS-4 missiles. It will also do away with 130 to 140 shorter-range Soviet weapons. The U.S. hasn't any parallel systems, but in talks last week, Washington agreed that separate from the INF agreement it would withdraw 72 nuclear warheads it holds for West German Pershing 1A missiles.    --Strategic Arms. Although U.S. officials point to some new Soviet flexibility, daunting obstacles remain, ranging from Soviet insistence that the U.S. adopt an interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty that would strongly restrict development of space defense to problems of verifying compliance with an agreement involving mobile missiles.    --Bilateral issues. The two sides last week worked out a 13-point work program that could lead to a number of agreements before the next summit. At issue are the future of the U.S.-Soviet long-term grain agreement, a push toward new accords involving nuclear fusion experiments, a fisheries accord that would give the U.S. increased access to waters off the Soviet coast, and talks on a whole range of &quot;people-to-people&quot; exchanges.    --Human rights. The Soviets discussed these issues more openly and invited the U.S. to a Moscow conference on humanitarian issues. Secretary of State Shultz said one of the most &quot;heartening&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot; aspects of last week's talks was the Soviet willingness to discuss in detail legal issues, individual cases and emigration levels.    --Regional issues. The two sides didn't reach agreements that would speed a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, but U.S. officials again noted a change in tone. &quot;The intriguing thing is that for the first time the Soviets didn't defend the Afghan regime or contest that it lacked popular support,&quot; said an administration official.    ---       U.S. and Soviet Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces    Long-Range Intermediate Nuclear Force Missiles    (Number of warheads)             U.S.                        Soviet Union    Pershing II          108           SS-20        1323    Ground-launced                     SS-4          112     Cruise Missiles     256    TOTAL                364           TOTAL        1435    Short-Range Intermediate Nuclear Force Missiles    (Number of warheads)       West Germany/U.S.                 Soviet Union    Pershing 1A           72           SS-12/22,     130                                        SS-23     to 140*   -- Joint West German-American Pershing 1A missiles will bedismantled upon removal of the other American and Sovietsystems.   -- Negotiators still must determine whether dismantling ofmissiles will take 3 or 5 years.   -- Treaty will include on-site verification of missiledestruction and later on-site inspections, but details mustbe worked out.   -- Nuclear material in warheads will be kept by U.S. andU.S.S.R.   *Approximate   Sources: Arms Control Association; U.S. officials</TEXT></DOC>
