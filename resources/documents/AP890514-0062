The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati, which owns FortScott Camp, announced last month it would permanently close theretreat near the federal government's Fernald uranium plant.   Residents of the area surrounding the camp have filed a $300million class-action lawsuit against the former operators of theplant, contending they allowed radioactive dust to contaminatelocal land, water and air for three decades.   The Energy Department has conceded that figures released in pastyears measuring the amount of radiation were too low. It isrevising them.   The plant processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons-makingfacilities.   The camp in Crosby Township, north of Cincinnati, opened in 1922and provided recreation for more than 150,000 campers over theyears.   Debbie Bonekamp, a member of the Fort Scott Camp Advisory Board,said she disagreed with the decision to close the facility.   ``We felt there was no danger with the environment,'' she said.``We'd had the water and soil tested each year (for uraniumcontamination), and it was always fine.''   The advisory board had suspended operations at the camp for thesummer because of dwindling enrollment, but hoped the enrollmentmight bounce back the next year.</TEXT></DOC>
