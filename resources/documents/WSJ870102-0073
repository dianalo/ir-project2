Washington designed specific roles for commercial banks, savings banks and investment banks. Savings banks, for example, could pay slightly more interest to savers but couldn't handle checks.    But finance has been slipping its regulatory bonds. You can use an automatic teller at O'Hare to get cash from your interest-bearing checking account in L.A. Some &quot;banks&quot; can book your Caribbean vacation or sell you a tool set.    And just this week, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which divided commercial bankers from investment bankers, came under renewed attack. The state of New York, home to a lot of banks, proposed to largely abandon the Glass-Steagall principle.    The New York Banking Department has decided to let banks chartered in the state get more involved in underwriting and other investment-bank activities. Responding to inquiries from Bankers Trust New York and J.P. Morgan, both chartered in New York, the regulators said they could use their considerable cash holdings to underwrite corporate equity and debt offerings, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and other investment-bank type activities.    Commercial banks are seeking this kind of business because some of their lines, lending to blue-chip corporations, for example, have dried up. Big companies now issue their own paper. The old Glass-Steagall arguments, aimed at limiting risk and dangers that big banks would end up controlling industry, look more and more dated. Investment banks provide billions in bridge loans for corporate restructurings and takeovers. Investment banks seeking more cash will be able to team up with commercial banks without having to look abroad, as Goldman Sachs did to find Japan's Sumitomo Bank.    Albany may be in for a fight over jurisdiction with federal regulators. The Fed has held back from liberalizing the rules for commercial banks because it gets the problem when banks fail. Paul Volcker has, however, urged Congress to review the prohibitions on corporate underwriting, &quot;recognizing that today, unlike 1933, bank holding companies conduct such activities abroad in substantial volume, and technological and other changes increasingly encourage securitization of some bank loans.&quot;    Albany's deregulation will probably force the Fed into deregulating more quickly than it intended. Nationally chartered banks and banks of other states will consider switching to New York. This competition for the best system is the genius of federalism, where each state is a laboratory to test new ideas.    The Fed -- and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- might also, however, have to exercise more restraint in guaranteeing deposits. Forcing banks to take greater responsibility along with any greater risk-taking would act as a brake on banks' going too far down the junk-bond, takeover, arbitrage road.    The upheaval we've already seen in banking obviously has not run its course. Investment bankers and commercial bankers may soon go by a new name -- just plain bankers. </TEXT></DOC>
