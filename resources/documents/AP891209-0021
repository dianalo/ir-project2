ALLEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There was little surprise when federalregulators took over New Jersey's largest savings and loan,removing its chief executive officer and directors.   City Federal Savings Bank in Bedminster, N.J., had beenrecording increasingly large losses from real estate ventures inNew Jersey, Florida and Texas.   Its third quarter results showed bad loans outweighing equity byabout nine times.   Furthermore, the savings bank said last month that it would beunable to meet new capital requirements that became effectiveThursday under the thrift bailout law signed last summer.   ``It's not surprising,'' William McCrystal, an analyst withRyan, Beck and Co. in West Orange, N.J., who has been following theinstitution's faltering performance, said Friday. ``They had anextremely large amount of non-performing assets in excess of theirequity.''   As of Sept. 30, City Federal had $747 million in non-performingassets _ past-due loans and loans that don't pay interest _ andonly $89 million in equity, compared with $326.2 million at the endof 1988.   ``Under normal conditions, non-performing assets are no morethan 25 percent of equity,'' McCrystal said. ``With $89 million inequity, their losses probably would have wiped out equity had thefeds not stepped in.''   The thrift's dire straits prompted the Office of ThriftSupervision in Washington to transfer control to the ResolutionTrust Corp., a federal agency created in August to dispose offailed Sandamp;Ls.   ``City Federal was below all its capital requirements. Itdoesn't look to us like they could recapitalize this institutionwithout federal assistance,'' said Bob Albanese, senior deputydirector of the Office of Thrift Supervision in New York.   ``And the institution is continuing to experience operationslosses and loan losses,'' Albanese said.   Bad commercial real estate and construction loans lie at theheart of the thrift's troubles. Only recently, City Federal sold amortgage banking operation in Ohio, McCrystal said.   City Federal was the lead lender in Port Liberte, a $750 millionluxury project planned for Jersey City, N.J., McCrystal said.   ``They got very aggressive in the real estate market, but itbegan to soften,'' he said.   The thrift also was hurt by new rules that phase out by 1995 anaccounting break known as goodwill.   City Federal was among several institutions in the early andmid-1980s that bought ailing thrifts when regulators had no moneyto deal with savings banks and were able to persuade institutionssuch as City Federal to take over the thrifts in exchange forgoodwill. According to McCrystal, City Federal had $213 million ingoodwill on its books as of Sept. 30.   Albanese said representatives of the Office of ThriftSupervision, Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. gathered at the savings bank's New Jersey officesFriday.   They replaced Chief Executive Officer John Atherton, other topCity Federal officers and the thrift's board of directors with agovernment-selected managing agent and oversight team, but retainedsome employees, Albanese said.   City Federal Savings Bank officials did not return repeatedphone calls.   According to RTC, which has taken control of 280 thrifts anddisposed of more than 30 nationwide, City Federal Savings Bank had$9.8 billion in assets and $7.3 billion in 858,348 deposit accounts.   RTC will help find a buyer for the institution, which maintained105 retail branches in New Jersey and Florida that are considered avaluable network. It also could decide to liquidate the thrift.   ``For right now, it's business as usual,'' Albanese said.   RTC will oversee a newly created federal mutual association,known as City Savings Bank, which will continue handlingdepositors' funds during normal business hours as a permanentsolution is negotiated.   McCrystal said the corporation's stock had become worthless,trading at just one-eighth Friday, but noted ``the significant losshas been over the last year or two. This isn't going to wipe outanybody.''   Four other New Jersey thrifts already have been taken over byfederal regulators.   McCrystal said the federal action was an indicator of things tocome now that Congress has clamped down on the floundering savingsindustry.   ``This says the government is going to follow through on thelegislation passed to do something about these large, troubledthrifts.''</TEXT></DOC>
