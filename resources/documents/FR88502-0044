(hereinafter collectively referred toas respondents).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ On October 1, 1987, in accordance with the pertinent provisionsof the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, and a Departmentaldirective from Bruce Smart, then-Acting Secretary of Commerce, implementingthose provisions, the Office of Export Enforcement was moved within theDepartment from the International Trade Administration of the United StatesDepartment of Commerce to the Bureau of Export Administration of the UnitedStates Department of Commerce. The functions and scope of authority ofthe Bureau of Export Administration are set forth in Department OrganizationOrder (DOO) 50-1, issued on March 23, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The reorganization which created the Bureau of ExportAdministration also created the positions of Under Secretary for ExportAdministration and Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement. <T3>See also</T3> DOO 10-16 (issued on March 10, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">As a result, the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement is nowthe Department official who issues temporary denial orders. </ITAG><T3>See</T3> DOO 50-1. At present, however, this position is vacant. Pursuantto DOO 50-1, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement is theDepartment official who is to perform the duties of the Assistant Secretarywhen that position is vacant.The Department states that, as a result of an ongoing investigation, ithas reason to believe that respondents are involved in a scheme to obtaincontrolled U.S.-origin commodities from the United States, take possessionof them in Switzerland and then reexport them, oftentimes to proscribeddestinations. The Department has reason to believe that, in carrying outtheir scheme, respondents have provided false and misleading statementsof material fact concerning the intended end-users of U.S.-origin equipmentrespondents ordered from the United States. In fact, it appears that theWestern European companies identified by respondents as being the intendedend-users had no involvement in the transactions. Once the U.S.-origingoods were received by respondents in Switzerland, the Department has reasonto believe that respondents reexported the goods to end-users in the Sovietbloc.The U.S.-origin goods which respondents obtained from the United Statesare controlled for reasons of national security. The Department also statesthat its investigation has given it reason to believe that respondentsBrero and Samata currently have in their possession and control U.S.-origincommodities which are controlled for reasons of national security.The Department believes that respondents' past activities, coupled withits belief that respondents Brero and Samata currently possess and controlU.S.-origin goods, establish that the violations of the Act and the Regulationswhich they are suspected of having committed and which the Department ispresently investigating were deliberate and covert and are likely to occuragain unless appropriate action is taken to reduce the likelihood thatrespondents can continue to acquire U.S.-origin goods either inside oroutside of the United States. The Department believes that respondents'activities show a clear pattern of disregard for the Act and the Regulations.Furthermore, the Department believes that in order to reduce the likelihoodthat respondents will continue to engage in activities which are in violationof the Act and the Regulations, a temporary denial order naming Mario Brero,Samata S.A., Marli S.A., Graphic Data Products S.A., Fincosid S.A., TourimexS.A. and Lilly Merchandising Co. is necessary to give notice to companiesin the United States and abroad that they should cease dealing with theseparties in transactions involving U.S.-origin goods.Therefore, based on the showing made by the Department, I find that anorder temporarily denying export privileges to the respondents is necessaryin the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of the Act andthe Regulations and to give notice to companies in the United States andabroad to cease dealing with the respondents in goods and technical datasubject to the Act and the Regulations in order to reduce the substantiallikelihood that respondents will continue to engage in activities whichare in violation of the Act and the Regulations. This order is issued onan <T3>ex parte </T3>basis without a hearing based on the Department's showingthat expedited action is required.<T3>Accordingly, it is hereby Ordered</T3>I. All outstanding individual validated export licenses in which any respondentappears or participates, in any manner or capacity, are hereby revokedand shall be returned forthwith to the Office of Export Licensing for cancellation.Further, all of respondents' privileges of participating, in any manneror capacity, in any special licensing procedure, including, but not limitedto, distribution licenses, are hereby revoked.II.
