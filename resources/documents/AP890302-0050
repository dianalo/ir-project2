Later Wednesday, prospects improved for arranging peace talkswith the guerrillas _ who are trying to negotiate participation innational elections.   President Jose Napoleon Duarte secured the support of RicardoAlvarenga, president of the opposition-controlled legislature, fordirect talks with the rebels and called on them to cease hostilitiesas a sign of good will.   The Legislative Assembly is controlled by the rightist RepublicanNationalist Alliance, or Arena, which has rejected guerrilla demandsthat the March 19 presidential vote be postponed so they canorganize a campaign. Arena, of which Alvarenga is a leader, isleading in the presidential polls.   The rebels have offered to take part in national elections _which they have previously boycotted _ and respect the outcome iftheir demand for postponement until September and security-relatedconcerns are met.   After a five-hour meeting Wednesday, Duarte and Alvarenga toldjournalists they had agreed to form a government commission fortalks with guerrilla commanders.   ``There must be a cessation of hostilities in order to beginconversations,'' Alvarenga said.   Duarte, whose government is backed by the United States, urgedthe rebel Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front to take such astep, but also said ``It is not a prerequisite.''   The rebels on Wednesday ignored the army's three-month unilateralcease-fire and attacked a garrison town in La Union, the easternmostprovince. Just before the army truce began at midnight Tuesday,rebels attacked a coffee-processing plant six miles north of SanSalvador.   The rebels reported killing 67 soldiers and wounding 25 in theattack on the garrison at Santa Rosa de Lima, 110 miles east of SanSalvador. The army said two soldiers, two rebels and a civilian werekilled and seven soldiers wounded in a two-hour attack.   ``A cease-fire not negotiated between opposing forces is notreal,'' said a statement issued by the rebel general command. ``Wedemand a serious response from the government to our communiqueregarding negotiations in the capital.''   On Sunday, Duarte proposed that direct negotiations with therebels begin in Guatemala City on Tuesday and that a cease-firefirst take effect.   The rebels insist any talks be held in San Salvador ``among andin full view of all Salvadorans'', beginning Saturday. Duartereiterated Guatemala as his personal preference on Wednesday.   ``Once we agree on a date for a meeting in the capital, we willdeclare a cessation of offensive operations,'' according to therebel command's Wednesday statement.   ``We consider that the supposed unilateral cease-fire of thearmed forces does not halt repression in the cities, nor does itwithdraw troops from operations in the countryside. It is apublicity maneuver to give the impression of flexibility.''   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday inWashington: ``This decision by President Duarte and the Salvadoranarmed forces addresses the most critical issue, that of bringingpeace to El Salvador.   ``President Duarte recognizes the crucial fact that violence anddemocracy don't mix. We are now waiting for the guerrillas todemonstrate that they are willing to do the same by ceasing theirongoing campaign of terrorism and assassinations.''   The war has claimed more than 70,000 lives.</TEXT></DOC>
