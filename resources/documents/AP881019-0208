Gen. ProsperAvril joined hundreds of troops Wednesday at a special Mass forarmy unity after a group of soldiers tried to overthrow the newmilitary government this week.   Hours after the Mass, about 100 young people held a sit-in infront of the Port-au-Prince Cathedral to protest a church ordertelling a popular priest, Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, to leave thecountry.   It was the fifth such demonstration in a week. An attack onAristide's congregation by armed thugs who killed 12 people andwounded 70 helped bring about the coup that swept Avril into powerlast month.   The Mass at the National Palace in this capital city, broadcastby the state-run Television Nationale, was attended by members ofthe army high command, hundreds of uniformed soldiers of thePresidential Guard, Cabinet members, and Avril's wife and daughter.   Television Nationale said Tuesday night that six officers andsoldiers were discharged from the army because of their role inSunday's coup attempt.   Centrist politicians say the failed coup was an attempt by ahandful of soldiers close to the deposed Duvalier dynasty to regaincontrol after a soldiers' revolt ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy asthe national leader on Sept. 17.The revolt also forced out dozensof unpopular officers.   However, leftist groups claim the coup attempt was a moveengineered by Avril to get rid of soldiers demanding radicalreforms.   Namphy took over after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled toFrance in February 1986, ending 29 years of repressive family rule.Namphy left power for four months after a military-backed civilianwon national elections but seized control again earlier this year.   The young protesters, meanwhile, accused Haiti's conservativebishops of trying to get rid of Aristide because of his radicalsermons urging the poor to fight for social justice.   ``It is obvious that the decision to transfer Aristide againstthe manifest desire of the majority of Haitians is inexplicablewithout the persistent influence of Rome on certain personalitiesin Haiti,'' the Rev. Antoine Adrien, another member of the church'sradical wing, said Wednesday.   Aristide said in a statement read by the church's Radio Soleilthat he had received an order from Rome to leave Haiti by lastMonday. However, a friend of the priest, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Aristide was still in Haiti on Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
