Uncertainty has sent prices surging. In New York, West Texasintermediate crude was $28.05 a barrel at Monday's close, afive-year high and $3.65 up on Friday's close. In Tokyo today,North Sea Brent Blend was trading at $27.75, up $1.40 from itsclose Monday.   The United Nations Security Council voted 13-0 on Monday toimpose broad sanctions against Iraq, punishment for its invasion ofKuwait. The penalties include a ban on imports and exports aimed atblocking Baghdad's oil trade.   ``There will be a potential restriction of oil supply in thenear future that could range in intensity from significant tohighly severe,'' the Middle East Economic Survey, a weeklynewsletter published in Cyprus, said Monday.   But in London, experts said disruption of oil supplies from Iraqand Kuwait posed no immediate danger of shortages. They said,however, that extra world capacity could be called upon quickly,pushing prices higher.   Iraq produced 3.1 million barrels of oil daily in July andKuwait 1.6 million. Together, that accounted for 9 percent of worldoutput, the International Energy Agency reported. Excluding Iraqand Kuwait, the Persian Gulf has unused capacity of 3.2 millionbarrels a day, the agency said.   The extra capability is concentrated in Saudi Arabia, butanalysts say there are doubts the Saudis would be willing toantagonize Iraq by stepping up output.   ``The key obviously lies with Saudi Arabia; and there must beconsiderable doubt as to how far the Kingdom would be prepared togo in antagonizing Iraq,'' the newsletter said.   But Lucy Mullins, an oil analyst at the London investmentcompany Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said: ``In the short term, Idon't think people are panicking too much. The world could last sixmonths or so almost quite happily.''   She said Norway, which doesn't belong to OPEC, might be able tokick in an extra 200,000 barrels a day.   Britain's North Sea supplies, amounting to 3.6 million barrels aday in July, have been constrained by summer maintenance andindustrial action by workers.   And oil producer Venezuela said Monday it would not immediatelyincrease its oil prices or production.   The reaction in Mexico, the world's fifth-biggest exporter ofcrude oil, was the same:   ``We're watching prices very closely, but we have not changedour policy,'' said a source at the state petroleum monopoly Pemex.   Mexico has been exporting an average of 1.2 million barrels ofoil a day and experts said the oil wells are pumping at fullcapacity.   Worldwide, the oil market has had an excess of supply and oilimporters' stocks are high, experts say. The oil shocks of the1970s also have made industrial nations accomplished in cuttingdemand.   Before the U.N. vote, the United States, the 12-nation EuropeanEconomic Community, Japan and other countries had announced plansto impose an embargo on Iraqi oil purchases.   Iraq, which pipes most of its oil through Saudi Arabia to theRed Sea and Turkey to the Mediterranean, on Monday cut back the oilflow through its Turkish pipeline following reports the UnitedStates had asked Turkey to block the lines. President Turgut Ozalof Turkey said before the U.N. Security Council imposed its embargothat he would abide by it.   Kuwaiti production was halted after Iraq's invasion.   The Dutch government said Monday it was stopping Iraqi andKuwaiti oil shipments to Rotterdam, one of the world's largest oilharbors.   France said Monday ships carrying Iraqi oil or under Iraqicontrol would be refused permission to dock at French ports.   And Australia, Brazil and Switzerland on Monday all announcedembargoes on Iraqi oil imports.   Brazil buys about 30 percent _ 160,000 barrels a day _ of itsoil from Iraq.   ``We are in a comfortable position because we produce over halfthe oil we use and already have 70 days worth of stocks,'' saidLanning Elwis, a spokesman for Brazil's state oil monopolyPetrobras.</TEXT></DOC>
