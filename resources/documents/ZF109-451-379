Box 586, Pacifica, CA 94044.andM;Price: US$5andM;PUMA Rating: 4 (on a scale of 1=lowest to 4=highest)andM;Reviewed for Newsbytes by: Sean McNamara 8/3/90andM;Summary: MacBinary to Mac is a translator for Apple File Exchange which doesthe same job as programs such as BinHex.andM;REVIEWandM;The simple fact that a MacBinary to Mac Apple File Exchange (AFE) translatorexists would seem to imply there is a significant number of Mac users usingbulletin boards (and like services) who carry out most of their download viaPC or Apple II computers.andP;  This would normally mean a transfer through AFE,and then a translation through a program such as BinHex to convert theMacBinary format file to Mac format.andM;However, with MacBinary to Mac, all you have to do is put the translator filein the same folder as AFE.andP;  When you start up AFE and select your files totransfer, you make sure that the MacBinary to Mac translator is the only oneselected, and press the translate button.andP;  The translator copies the filesover while converting them to Mac format, and when you exit of AFE, the filesare there, ready to be used.andM;The time benefits of this system are obvious.andP;  Because all the work is donethrough only one program, you save time by not starting and quitting from theBinHex program.andP;  Secondly, the file only has to be written once by AFE,rather than twice (once for the MacBinary file, and then when BinHextranslate to the Mac file.) On a test 100 kilobyte file, it took around 50seconds to use AFE and BinHex to translate, with the need to delete theoriginal MacBinary file after the translation to Mac format is completed.andO;When AFE was operated using the MacBinary to Mac translator, translation timewas reduced to around 20 seconds, with no need to delete any files.andM;The author admits the translator is a simple program, so if things don'tquite work, the old method can always be used.andP;  So far, however, thetranslator has performed well.andP;  Any time saving is well worthwhile, and thebonus of getting rid of the nuisance factor of MacBinary to Mac translationsis well worth the $5.00 registration fee.andM;As a side-note, a Mac to MacBinary translator is also available from PEEK[65]and works in very much the same way as the MacBinary to Mac translator.andO;However, this translator performs no faster than the AFE/BinHex combination,but still offers the &quot;tidiness&quot; of using only one program.andM;PUMA RATINGSandM;PERFORMANCE: 4.andP;  MacBinary to Mac provides a translator for AFE which worksaround twice as fast as using BinHex after translating through AFE.andP;  It alsomakes translations a lot less messy, as everything can be handled in oneprogram with only one file needing to be written to disk.andM;USEFULNESS: 4.andP;  For any users who have need to do many translations Mac-PCthis translator is excellent value.andM;MANUAL: 4.andP;  Although the manual is only supplied in a text file, there reallyisn't any need to refer to it except for a bit of background user andregistration details.andM;AVAILABILITY: 4.andP;  The translator should be available through most user groupsand bulletin boards, and if all else fails, the author can be contactedthrough the address above.andM;(Sean McNamara/19900720)</TEXT></DOC>
