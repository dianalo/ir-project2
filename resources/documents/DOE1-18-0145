Gluteal muscle was takenfrom a rabbit, and sections of varying thicknesses were made. The tissuesamples were positioned at the aperture of an integrating sphere. Thelaser light was passed through an optical attenuator, coupled to a 600-micronsfiber, and then directed onto the surface of the tissue. Transmittedlight was collected by the integrating sphere. Light measurements weremade with a radiometer. This procedure was repeated for samples of differingthickness using the gold vapor laser as the light source. The identicalprocedure was performed using the argon-pumped dye laser. No significantdifference was found in percent transmission of light using the goldvapor laser as compared to the argon-pumped dye laser.</TEXT></DOC>
