Justification </ITAG>1. Supplementary questions concerning receipt of pension benefits, shownin Attachment A, are proposed for the December 1989 Current PopulationSurvey (CPS). This survey is requested by the Pension and Welfare BenefitsAdministration (PWBA) of the Department of Labor. The purpose of this surveyis to provide comprehensive information on monthly benefits and lump sumdistributions received under all types of deferred compensation plans bypersons 40 years of age or older, with special emphasis on retirees. Datacollected on year of initial benefit receipt will enable evaluation ofchanges in types and amounts of benefits received by workers retiring duringdifferent periods. The private pension system, spurred in part by Federal legislation, hasundergone a major shift in recent years in the types of plans establishedto provide retirement income, from the more traditional defined benefitplan to the defined contribution plan. (Defined benefit plans are usuallyfinanced entirely by the employer. At retirement, the employee generallyreceives an annuity, the value of which is determined by a formula basedon years of service times either a percentage of pay or a flat dollar amount.Some defined benefit plans periodically provide post retirement increasesin benefits, either on a regular or ad hoc basis. Under a defined contributionplan, the employee is often required to contribute. At retirement, theemployee generally receives all retirement money in the form of a singlelump sum payment. The value of this payment is directly related to theamount of money contributed by the employer, the employee, and investmentearnings.) In 1975, only 13 percent of all covered workers received basic coverageunder defined contribution plans, with the remaining 87 percent coveredunder defined benefit plans. By 1987, the use of various types of definedcontribution plans to provide basic coverage had increased to an estimated30 percent of all covered workers. In addition, the use of defined contributionplans to provide supplemental coverage has increased from 21 percent ofall covered workers in 1975 to an estimated 40 percent in 1987. Overall,more active participants are now enrolled in defined contribution plansthan in defined benefit plans. Benefit levels provided under defined contribution plans are less certainthan those provided under defined benefit plans, with a greater burdenand responsibility placed on workers to provide for their retirement income.For example, the now common use of 401(k) plans as retirement vehiclesbases the ultimate amount of benefits payable at retirement on the employee'svoluntary contributions and often on how employees decided to invest theiraccounts. Defined contribution plans are also much more likely than definedbenefit plans to provide benefits in the form of a lump sum payment. Moreover,if a retiree with a defined contribution plan requests an annuity, thevalue of the retiree's account is used to purchase an insured annuity withno possibility of post-retirement benefit increases. Because of this fundamentalshift occurring in the method of providing retirement coverage and benefits,a survey is needed to measure the total amount of pension benefits receivedunder all types of deferred compensation plans and the adequacy of thosebenefits. The oversight of private pension plans falls within the jurisdictionof the PWBA under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).The collection of this information is authorized by Section 513 of ERISA.2. Beginning with the passage of ERISA in 1974, there have been 14 majorFederal legislative Acts designed to increase the soundness of the pensionsystem. The overall intent of this survey is to assess the experience ofretirees covered under pension plans during their working career and toevaluate how retiree pension benefits have fared in recent years underthe changing climate resulting from Federal legislation and trends towarddefined contribution plans. This survey will provide analysis data forpublic policy issues including: Identification of the demographic characteristicsof retirees with and without pension income, the amounts of pension benefitsreceived, the wage replacement rates provided by pensions, the extent towhich post-retirement increases cover increases in the consumer price index(CPI), the rate at which married retirees are electing a joint and survivoroption, and the rate at which retirees are receiving monthly annuitiesversus lump sum distributions. In addition, the data will determine howbenefit levels and forms of benefits have changed over time. Accurate dataon these subjects are absolutely necessary to evaluate the current privatepension system and to develop policies to correct any inadequacies. Following is a discussion of the proposed supplement: Questions 1 through 3: Defining the Supplement Universe Questions 1 through 3 identify persons eligible for the supplement. Question1 establishes the age criteria; only persons aged 40 and over are likelyto receive pension benefits. Question 2, the employment check-item, identifiespersons currently employed and directs them to the receipt of pension questions,beginning with question 4. For these people, receipt of pension informationwill be collected only with respect to a possible former employer. Informationon pension coverage provided by a current employer, for those employed,was collected in the May 1988 CPS supplement. Data collected from thisproposed supplement on receipt of pension benefits, along with the May1988 data, will provide PWBA with invaluable information that they needto evaluate the current private pension system. Those identified as not working per check-item 2 will skip to item 3, whichdetermines the likelihood of receipt of retirement benefits based on totalyears of service at all employers. Those working less than 5 years areunlikely to qualify for pension benefits. If they qualify, their benefitwill likely be small and have little effect on the survey results. Question 4: Pension Coverage This question identifies persons who were covered under a pension planat a former employer. A response of ``yes'' to this item qualifies a personto respond to additional questions that will determine the type of plan,if any, the person receives retirement payments from. Question 5: Receipt of Benefit This question determines if respondents are receiving benefits from anytype of deferred compensation plan with a lifetime annuity. Questions 6 and 7: Receipt of Dual Pension Benefits Approximately 40 percent of all active participants are covered under twoor more plans (generally both a defined benefit and defined contributionplan). Identification of dual pension recipients will enable comparisonof the total benefits received by dual recipients with benefits receivedby those with only one plan. It will also enable measurement of post-retirementbenefit increases received by dual recipients from their plan providingthe largest benefit. Question 8: Amount of Pension Benefit Received Each Month From All Annuities.This question collects income amounts on the total monthly pension benefitsbeing received under all plans that have a lifetime annuity. The numberof such plans was determined by the response to question 6. Questions 9 and 10: Joint and Survivor Option Concern for widows dependent on the income of a spouse that dies is reflectedin both the 1974 ERISA legislation and the Retirement Equity Act of 1984.Both legislative acts require private pension plans to include survivoroptions in varying degrees. Questions 9 and 10 will determine the percentageof married pension recipients electing a joint and survival option andallow PWBA to study the impact of these laws. Question 11: Dual Annuity Benefit Check Item For dual annuity benefit recipients, information on change in benefit amountand identification of whether the benefit is from a defined benefit planwill be asked with respect to the annuity providing the largest benefit.Question 12: Amount of Pension Benefit Received Each Month from the LargestAnnuity This question collects the current monthly amount of pension benefits beingreceived under the annuity plan that provides the largest benefit. Question 13: Type of Plan A response of ``yes'' to this question will indicate that the largest annuitypayment is coming from a defined benefit plan. Question 14 and 15: Post-Retirement Benefit Changes Responses to these questions will allow PWBA to determine the number ofretirees who receive cost of living adjustments either on a regular orad hoc basis and the extent to which post retirement increases match increasesin the CPI. Question 16: Age When Benefits Began For retirees receiving post-retirement benefit changes, comparison of respondentscurrent age (from basic CPS) with age when benefits began will permit comparisonof any post-retirement benefit changes with CPI changes over the same period.For all retirees, comparison of average benefit levels by year of initialreceipt can be made. Question 17: Number of Years of Benefit Accrual This question will enable comparisons of benefit amounts by average numberof years of benefit accrual. Question 18: Receipt of Lump Sum Distribution This question will indicate the extent to which retirees receive a lumpsum or fixed payment benefit distribution, both for those receiving a lifetimeannuity and for those covered under a plan but not receiving a lifetimeannuity. By comparing the amount of benefits received from these two typesof plans, the PWBA can measure the adequacy of the private pension systemto provide income security for the retired. Question 19: Amount of Lump Sum Payment(s) This question, combined with the question on monthly receipt of lifetimeannuities, will indicate total private pension benefits received by retirees.Question 20: Age When Lump Sum or First Fixed Payment was Received The response to this question will identify the actual value of the lumpsum or first fixed payment, at the time it was received, after adjustingfor inflation. Question 21: Type of Plan A response of ``no'' to this question will indicate that the lump sum orfirst fixed payment received came from a defined contribution plan. Question 22: Additional Pension Benefits This question targets respondents in their late 50s and early 60s. Itspurpose is to determine the number of persons retired and vested but unableto receive benefits until they reach the retirement age specified by theplan for benefits to begin. Questions 23 and 24: Amount of Social Security Benefits These questions on Social Security benefits combined with earlier questionson private pension benefits will determine retiree's overall economic securityprovided by pensions. Questions 25: Pension Coverage Check Item This item directs the interviewer to the appropriate lead-in to ask respondentsabout the characteristics of the job which provided coverage or the characteristicsof the longest job for those never covered. Question 26: Years Worked for Employer This question will enable examination of the relationship between lengthof employment, coverage status, and benefit status. Question 27: Year Employment Ended For those receiving benefits, this question will determine whether benefitpayments began at retirement or if there was a waiting period. Question 28: Full Versus Part-Time Employment This question will indicate the relationship between full versus part timeemployment and the likelihood of having pension coverage, receiving benefits,and the amount of any benefits received. Question 29: Union StatusThis question will indicate the relationship between membership in a collectivebargaining unit while employed and coverage status, receipt of benefit,amount of benefit, and extent of post-retirement benefit changes. Questions 30A-30E: Employer Classification These questions collect information on the former job that provides pensioncoverage or, for those not covered, information on the job worked at thelongest. They will enable measurement and comparison of pension benefitstatus and benefit amounts by industry, occupation, and class of worker.Question 31: Pre-retirement Earnings This question will enable examination of the relationship between earningsand coverage status. Collection of earnings data together with amount ofinitial pension benefit (Question 15) will also enable computation of wagereplacement rates for those receiving pension benefits. Question 32: Firm Size This question allows measurement of pension benefit eligibility and pensionamounts by firm size. Together with industry, occupation, and collectivebargaining status data, it will identify characteristics of firms by averageamounts of pension benefits provided and likelihood of providing post-retirementbenefit increases. Questions 33-36: Receipt of Spousal Benefit These questions will identify the extent and amounts of benefits receivedby widows and widowers from the pension plan of a deceased spouse. Thisinformation combined with the joint survivor information (questions 9 and10) will indicate the adequacy of the current private pension system tosecure the income needs of widows and widowers whose deceased spouse receivedpension benefits.3. The Bureau of the Census is using the most improved method of data collectionavailable to reduce burden. The CPS sample was redesigned based on resultsfrom the 1980 Decennial Census. This sample produces data of greater reliability,though the sample sizes of the new and old samples are almost identical.The supplemental questions are designed to obtain the required informationwith minimal respondent burden. The proposed questions are the result ofnumerous consultations between the Bureau of the Census and the Pensionand Welfare Benefits Administration. The questions represent the maximumamount of information, as required by the sponsors, that can be collectedwithin the constraints of the CPS and the limitation of respondent burden.4. Currently two ongoing surveys, the March CPS income supplement and theSurvey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), routinely collect dataon pension income. However, neither of these surveys collects the in-depthinformation needed to provide a comprehensive profile of total pensionincome from all sources and to measure the adequacy of post-retirementincreases in pension benefits. Specifically, the March CPS inquires about the amount of pension incomereceived the previous year. It does not collect data on lump sum distributionsor on the extent of cost-of-living increases, nor does it characterizepast work experience and the employer from which such benefits were established.The SIPP does not collect information on lump sum payments received fromdeferred retirement plans, the magnitude of any cost-of-living benefitincreases since first receipt of benefits, or the amount of any survivorpension income. In addition, the SIPP interviews a substantially smallernumber of households so that the cell sizes for retirees in different agegroups become too small to permit statistically valid analysis. NeitherSIPP nor the March CPS allows for comparison between the retired populationthat receives benefits and those that do not. The PWBA is currently developing an analytical file for pension recipientsusing the SIPP data base. This file will combine relevant SIPP panels onemployee and retiree income and benefits. The file will be used to examinetotal worker and retiree income from all sources and the compensation packageof benefits provided by employers. The data available from SIPP on totalincome received over a relatively short period of time will complementthe data collected under this CPS supplement on total pension income receivedby retirees and workers during their lifetime. In addition, the SIPP willbe used to analyze job mobility, changes in type of pension coverage forthe same workers and other behavioral analysis for which the CPS is notappropriate. Two periodically conducted surveys, the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)and the New Beneficiary Survey (NBS), also collect pension income data.These surveys, however, collect only limited components of pension income.Moreover, their sample populations are not designed to obtain accuratecross-sectional estimates by age group.The SCF does not contain questions on post-retirement benefit changes.It requests information on lump sum payments only from the last job held.It cannot be determined whether lump sum payments include only return ofemployee contributions. Analysis of available data on retireee pensionincome is also limited by the small sample size of only 5,000 households.The NBS survey asks if benefits have increased since retirement but dataon the magnitude of any increases are not collected. The NBS also interviewsonly a limited portion of the relevant population. It does not includeindividuals until they reach Social Security beneficiary status. Thus nodata are collected on early retirees receiving private pensions or on individualsage 62 or over receiving private pensions but working and deferring receiptof Social Security benefits. The May 1988 CPS supplement collected information on retirement coverageprovided to those currently employed by their current employer, not onbenefits received from a former employer. 5. Past surveys that have included questions on pension income have beengeared toward collecting data on retirement income provided under traditionalpensions plans. The proliferation of new types of deferred compensationplans in recent years as both primary and supplemental retirement vehicleshas resulted in potentially major changes in the form and amount of pensionincome. The format of the questions contained in surveys which routinelycollect data on pension income is also inadequate to provide a comprehensiveprofile to total income received by individuals under all types of deferredcompensation plans. Specifically, these surveys generally collect data on current but not pastpension income and usually define benefits as pension or retirement income.The surveys miss substantial payments made in the form of lump sum distributionsand require respondents to make a judgement as to whether income receivedfrom a profit sharing, savings, or employee stock ownership plan shouldbe categorized as pension income. Moreover, there is no current data setto provide the comprehensive data needed to perform the analysis describedin (A.2) above. 6. The collection of the CPS and its supplemental questions does not involvesmall businesses or other small entities. 7. This is the first time this information will be collected in conjunctionwith the CPS. Therefore, the effect of less frequent collection is to notcollect the information. The consequences to Federal program or policyactivity of not collecting the information are dscribed in (A.2) above.8. These data will be collected in a manner consistent with the guidelinesin 5 CFR 1302.6. 9.

The supplement data will be collected in compliance with the PrivacyAct of 1974 and OMB Circular A-130. Approximately 1 week before the startof interviewing, each new or returning sample household receives an advanceletter. This letter includes the information required by the Privacy Actof 1974, informs each respondent of the voluntary nature of the survey,and states the estimated time required for participating in the survey.Additionally, interviews must ask each respondent if he/she received theadavance letter and, if not, must provide a copy of the letter to eachrespondent and allow sufficent time for him/her to read its contents. Also,interviewers now provide households with the ``How the Census Bureau KeepsYour Information Strictly Confidential'' pamphlet, which further statesthe confidentiality assurances associated with this data collection effortsand the Census Bureau's past performance in assuring confidentiality. All information given by respondents to Census Bureau employees is heldin strict confidence by Title 13, United States Code, Section 9. Each Censusemployee has taken an oath to that effect and is subjed to a jail penaltyand substantial fine if he/she discloses any information.11. The December CPS supplement does not contain any questions of a sensitivenature.12. The cost to the Government of the CPS program to which this form relatesis expected to be $27 million in fiscal year 1990. The costs are to beborne by the Bureau of the Census, the Department of Labor and other Governmentagencies, if involved. The total estimated cost to the Federal Governmentfor this supplement is $260,000; this cost is borne by the PWBA.13. The estimated respondent burden is 2,850 hours for fiscal year 1990.Based on professional judgement, the estimated average length of each supplementinterview is 3.0 minutes for each sample household. The actual interviewtime for a household will depend on the size of the household and the characteristicsof its occupants.14. This survey was projected in the FY89 ICB for 3,000 burden hours. Thisdoes not exceed that amount. It does represent a program increase of 2,850hours.15. Supplement data will be collected by the Census Bureau during the periodof December 10-16. A final data file will be available to the sponsorsby April 1990 and to the public by June 1990 when the sponsors expect topublish the results.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Collection of Information Employing Statistical Methods</ITAG>1. The December supplement is conducted in conjunction with the basic CPSfor which the universe is 93 million households. From this universe, asample of approximately 71,000 households is selected each month, and interviewsare obtained from approximately 57,000 households or 117, 000 persons 14years old or older. We will ask supplement questions in all of the eightrotations. Everyone aged 40 years or older will be asked the supplementquestions, and we expect to obtain interviews from about 90 percent ofthe eligible respondents. The proposed questions will be asked of the sampleperson, either at the time of the CPS interview or during a telephone orpersonnel callback.2. This survey is a supplemental survey associated with the December CPS.Attachment B contains an overview of the CPS sample design and weightingmethodology. Attachment C contains a statement of the estimates from aCPS supplement conducted in August 1988, since the actual December statementwill not be written until after the data are collected. Although the subjectmatter is different, the August statement approximates the sampling errorcommon to most CPS supplements.3. Response rates and data accuracy for the CPS are maintained at highlevels through clerical edits, interviewer instructions and training, andclose monitoring of these data. (Refer to paragraph 5 of Attachment B fora discussion of CPS nonresponse.)4. The CPS is currently undergoing the latest phase in a series of methodologicaland questionnaire tests; this is described in paragraph 6 of AttachmentB.5.

CPS Sample Design and Selection The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey conducted in approximately56,000 occupied households throughout the United States. The CPS is a probability sample based on a stratified sampling scheme.In general, the CPS sample is selected from lists of addresses obtainedfrom the most recent decennial census and updated for new construction.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. State-Based Design </ITAG>In the first stage of sampling, primary sampling units (PSUs) are selected.These PSUs consist of counties or groups of counties in the United States,and are grouped into strata. The CPS is a state-based design. Therefore,all strata are defined within state boundaries and the sample is allocatedamong the states to produce state and national estimates with the requiredreliability, while keeping total sample size to a minimum. Each stratumconsists of one or more PSUs. Within each stratum, a single PSU is chosenfor the sample, with probability proportional to its population as of themost recent decennial census. This PSU represents the entire stratum fromwhich it was selected. In the case of strata consisting of only one PSU,the PSU is termed ``self-representing.'' A sample of addresses within thesample PSUs is obtained in a second step. Most of the sample addressesare selected from census lists in a single stage of sampling within theselected PSU; for a relatively small proportion, an additional stage ofselection within the PSU is necessary. This two-step process is roughly equivalent to the simple plan of dividingeach state into ultimate sampling units (USUs), each containing about fourneighboring housing units, and selecting clustered samples of these USUsfor interview. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Stratification </ITAG>The variables chosen for grouping PSUs in each state into strata reflectthe primary interest of the CPS in maximizing the reliability of estimatesof labor force characteristics. Basically, the same set of stratificationvariables are used for each state: employment and unemployment statisticsby male, female, and total population; employment statistics by occupation;change in population since 1970 and other variables. If a significant proportionof a state's 1980 census population (0+) is Black or of Hispanic origin,a few additional variables are included. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Rotation System </ITAG>Each sample is divided into eight approximately equal rotation groups.A rotation group is interviewed for 4 consecutive months, temporarily leavesthe sample for 8 months and then returns for 4 more consecutive monthsbefore retiring permanently from the CPS (after a total of eight interviews).This rotation scheme has been in use since July 1953. The end result ofthis rotation pattern is an improvement in the reliability of estimatesof month-to-month change as well as estimates of year-to-year change. <ITAG tagnum="81">d. Phase-in of New Design </ITAG>Since the creation of the CPS in 1940, the sample has been redesigned severaltimes to upgrade the quality of the survey, improve the reliability ofthe data, and meet the changing needs for the data. Most recently, the1970 design was phased out and replaced by the design described in thispaper. The introduction of the revised design involved several changesthat began in April 1984 and were completed in July 1985. At the time it was put into place, the 1970 design was intended to providereliable national estimates of labor force characteristics. Strata weredefined within four regions of the United States, with many strata crossingstate boundaries. Beginning in the mid 1970's, more accurate estimatesof state labor force data were needed. This led to the implementation ofa revised design based on state geography. The phase-in of the new design occurred in two waves. The first involved``continuing'' areas: areas selected in both the old and new design. Thispart of the phase-in consisted of updating the sampling frame in theseareas beginning in April 1984 and continuing through July 1985. Ninetypercent of the entire sample was in ``continuing'' areas. The second wave involved changing the geographic areas selected to be sampled.From November 1984 through June 1985, geographic areas selected in thenew design that were not in the old design (``new'' areas) gradually replacedgeographic areas selected in the old design but not in the new design (outgoingareas). Sample households selected from address lists obtained from the1980 census and new construction permits issued after 1980 replaced householdsselected from the 1970 census lists and permits for new construction issuedsince 1970. In total, the redesigned sample includes 729 geographic areas from a totalof 1,973 geographic areas in the United States. In the 1970 design, 629areas were chosen to represent the 1,924 geographic areas into which thecountry was divided. The areas used in the 1970 and 1980 designs are notcompletely comparable becaue many of the sample areas were redefined for1980. This redefinition was carried out for a number of reasons. Primaryamong these was the shift from a national sample design to one designedto produce both state and national estimates. In addition, some samplingareas were redefined to correspond to the new metropolitan area definitions,and others were redefined to improve efficiency in field operations.2. CPS Estimation ProcedureUnder the estimating methods used in the CPS, all of the results for agiven month become available simultaneously and are based on returns forthe entire panel of respondents. The CPS estimation procedure involvesweighting the data from each sample person. The unbiased weight, whichis the inverse of the probability of the person being in the sample, isa rough measure of the number of actual persons that the sample personrepresents. In the 1980 design, almost all sample persons within the samestate will have the same unbiased weight. The unbiased weights are thenadjusted for noninterview, and the ratio estimation procedure is applied.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Noninterview Adjustment</ITAG>The weights for all interviewed households are adjusted to account foroccupied sample households for which no information was obtained. Reasonsfor a noninterviewed household include absence, impassable roads, refusals,or unavailability for other reasons. This adjustment is performed by noninterviewcluster. Noninterview clusters are classified as either MSA or non-MSA.PSUs classified as MSA are assigned to MSA clusters. Likewise, non-MSAPSUs are assigned to non-MSA clusters. MSAs of the same or similar sizeare grouped in the same noninterview cluster. All non-MSA areas in a stateare grouped within the same noninterview cluster. There are two cells withina noninterview cluster. Within MSA clusters, the cells are central cityand balance of the MSA. Within non-MSA clusters, the cells are urban andrural.b. Ratio EstimatesThe distribution of the population selected in the sample may differ somewhat,by chance, from that of the population as a whole, in such characteristicsas age, race, and sex. Since these characteristics are correlated closelywith labor force participation and other principal measurements made fromthe sample, the latter estimates can be improved substantially when weightedappropriately by the known distribution of these population characteristics.This is accomplished through two stages of ratio estimates as follows:(1) <T3>First-stage ratio estimate.</T3> In the CPS, a portion of the sampleareas is chosen to represent both itelf and other areas not in the sample;the remainder of the sample areas represent only themselves. The first-stageratio estimation procedure was designed to reduce that portion of the varianceresulting from requiring sample areas to represent nonsample areas. Therefore,this procedure is applied only to sample areas the represent other areasand is done by black/nonblack cells at a state level.(2) <T3>Second-stage ratio level. </T3>The second-stage ratio estimate adjustssample estimates of the population by rotation group (month-in-sample)in a number of age-sex-race-ethnicity groups to independently derived censusestimates of the population in each of these groups. This adjustment reducesmean square error of sample estimates by reducing bias due to differentialcoverage of the sampling frame. The second-stage is carried out in threesteps and each set of three steps is referred to as a ``rake''. There willbe six cycles of raking.In the first step, the sample estimates are adjusted for each state andthe District of Columbia by month-in-sample to an independent control forthe civilian noninstitutional population (16+) for the state. The secondstep of the adjustment is done at the national level by Hispanic ethnicityand month-in-sample. Hispanic and not Hispanic each have nine age/sex cells,which are adjusted to nationwide independent control counts (14+). Thefinal step of the second-stage is performed by Black, White and Other racecategories. The cell division is by age/race/sex and month-in-sample. Eachof these cells is adjusted to nationwide independent control counts (14+)as in the previous step. The entire second-stage ratio estimation procedureis iterated through six rakes. This iteration ensures that the sample estimatesboth of state population and of national age-sex-race-ethnic categorieswill be virtually equal to the independent population estimates.E. Specialized SamplingAn unusual problem occurs in the CPS sample that requires specialized samplingprocedures. This problem occurs in rural areas in the state of Alaska becauseof its sparse population. Special methods of defining segments are usedin these areas of the Alaskan sample.4. Periodic Data Collection CycleCollection of CPS data on a monthly basis is mandated in Paragraph 2 ofTitle 29, United States Code. Less frequent collection would place theBureau of Labor Statistics, which is the cosponsor of the CPS, in violationof this code.5. Nonresponse in CPSIf a respondent is reluctant to participate in CPS, the interviewer immediatelyinforms the regional office staff. The region office sends a follow-upletter to the household explaining CPS in greater detail and urging cooperation.The interviewer then recontacts the household and attempts the interviewagain. If this procedure fails, a Supervisory Field Representative thencontacts the household in an attempt to convert the reluctant respondent.Methods used to interview reluctant households include conducting telephoneor personal interviews with the household, if so requested, and interviewinga designated individual within the household. The CPS estimation procedureadjusts for nonresponse in its noninterview adjustment section. This procedureis detailed in Paragraph 2.a. above. Individual item nonresponse is allocatedusing a procedure in which the mission data are assigned from individualswhose data are complete and have similar characteristics. The CPS noninterviewrates range between 4-5 percent monthly.Accuracy of the CPS data is maintained through interviewer training andmonthly home studies, monitoring of error and noninterview rates, and systematicreinterviewing of CPS households. Each month one-sixth of all CPS enumeratorshave a third of their assignments reinterviewed. Errors uncovered duringthe reinterview are discussed with the original interviewer and remedialaction taken.6. Methodological TestingThe basic CPS program is not used as a vehicle for testing procedures ormethods. There is, however, an extensive program of testing already conductedand currently underway on CPS methods, procedures, and content. This program,the Methods Development Survey (MDS), and its predecessor, the MethodsTest Panel (MTP), has been underway since May 1978 and is continuing atthis time.Currently, the MDS is testing the use of Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing(CATI). There have been two distinct phases thus far. The first was designedto identify and resolve operational problems associated with the use ofCATI. The second, which is ongoing, will measure differences in labor forceestimates produced by the regular CPS methodology and the CATI procedures,and will measure differences in data quality between these two methodologies.7. CPS Statistical ContactsIndividuals consulted on the statistical aspects of CPS are Messrs. PrestonJ. Waite (763-2672), Gary Shapiro (763-2674), Larry Cahoon (763-5855),and Paul Bettin (763-2651), of the Statistical Methods Division, Bureauof the Census. Messrs. Thomas Walsh (763-2776), Gregory Russell (763-2782),and Ms. Kathleen Creighton (763-2773), Demographic Surveys Division, Bureauof the Census, have responsibility for data collection and processing.Messrs. Thomas Plewes (523-1180) and John Bregger (523-1944), Bureau ofLabor Statistics, are responsible for data analysis.<ITAG tagnum="85">Attachment C_Source and Reliability of the August 1988 CPS Supplementon Health Insurance Coverage</ITAG>Source of DataThe estimates for this survey come from the August 1988 Current PopulationSurvey (CPS) and from supplementary questions to the CPS. The monthly CPS,conducted by the Bureau of the Census, deals mainly with labor force datafor the civilian noninstitutional population. Census Bureau interviewersask questions relating to labor force particiaption about each member inevery sample household. In addition, in August 1988, the interviewers askedadditional questions about health insurance coverage for persons 40 yearsold and older.<T3>CPS Design.</T3> The CPS sample, selected from the 1980 Decennial Census,represents all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Census Bureaucontinually updates the sample to reflect new construction. The samplehouseholds are in 729 sample areas which include 1973 counties and equivalentareas. About 56,100 occupied households were eligible for interview. Forabout 2,500 of these households, interviewers did not obtain interviewsbecause they were unable to find the occupants at home after repeated callsor for some other reason.<T3>CPS Estimation Procedure.</T3> The procedure to calculate estimatesfor this survey involves the inflation of the weighted sample results toindependent estimates of the total civilian noninstitutional populationof the United States by age, race, sex and Hispanic/non-Hispanic categories.These independent estimates are based on statistics from the decennialcensuses of population; statistics on births, deaths, immigration and emigration;and statistics on the size of the Armed Forces.<T3>Supplement Estimation Procedure.</T3> In addition to the CPS estimationprocedure, the health insurance coverage supplement requires two additionalweighting steps. First, the weights for all interviewed households areadjusted to account for occupied sample households that responded to theCPS, but not to the supplement questionnaire. Second, ratio estimationbrings labor force estimates from the supplement into agreement as closelyas possible with the August labor force estimates from the basic CPS.Reliability of the EstimatesSince CPS estimates come from a sample, they may differ somewhat from figuresfrom a complete census using the same questionnaires, instructions, andenumerators. Two types of errors are possible in an estimate based on asample survey, sampling and nonsampling. The accuracy of a survey resultdepends on both types. Exercise particular care in the interpretation offigures based on a relatively small number of cases or on small differencesbetween estimates, because the full extent of the nonsampling error isunknown.<T3>Nonsampling Variability.</T3> Nonsampling errors can be attributedto many sources, e.g., inability to obtain information about all casesin the sample, definitional difficulties, differences in the interpretationof questions, inability or unwillingness on the part of respondents toprovide correct information, inability to recall information, errors madein data collection such as in recording or coding the data, errors madein processing the data, errors made in estimating values for mising data,and failure to represent all units with the sample (undercoverage).CPS undercoverage results from missed housing units and missed personswithin sample households. Overall undercoverage, compared to the levelof the 1980 Decennial Census, is about 7 percent. CPS undecoverage varieswith age, sex, and race. Generally, undercoverage is larger for males thanfor females and larger for Black and other races combined than for Whites.Ratio estimation to independent population controls, as described previously,partially corrects for the bias due to survey undercoverage. However, biasesexist in the estimates to the extent that missed persons in missed householdsor missed persons in interviewed households have different characteristicsfrom those of interviewed persons in the same age-sex-race-Hispanic group.Furthermore, the Census Bureau does not adjust the independent populationcontrols for undecoverage in the 1980 census.For additional information on nonsampling error including the possibleimpact on CPS data when known, refer to Statistical Policy Working Paper3, <T3>An Error Profile: Employment as Measured by the Current PopulationSurvey,</T3> Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, 1978 and Technical Paper 40, <T3>The Current Population Survey: Design and Methodology,</T3> Bureauof the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce.<T3>Sampling Variability.</T3> Sampling variability is variation that occurredby chance because a sample rather than the entire population was surveyed.The standard errors given in the following tables are measures of samplingvariability.Although standard errors are the accepted measure of sampling variability,these standard errors also include the effect of some nonsampling errorsin responses and enumeration but do not meaure any systematic biases inthe data. (Bias is the difference, averaged over all possible samples,between the estimate and the desired value.)<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-29-M 004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 599-602</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-29-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table A-1._Parameters for Calculating Standard Errors of EstimatedNumbers and Percentages for Health Insurance Coverage</T4><H1>Characteristic</H1><H1>a</H1><H1>b</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Total or White <D>0.000024</D><D>2,217</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Black<D>000234</D><D>2,397</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hispanic Origin<D>000234</D><D>2,397</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,10,10,10</C><T4>Table A-2._Standard Errors of Estimated Numbers for Health InsuranceCoverage </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Number in thousands]</ITAG><H1>Size of estimate</H1><H1>Standard error</H1><H2>Total or white</H2><H2>Black or hispanic orgin</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">10<D>5</D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25<D>7</D><D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50<D>11</D><D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100<D>15</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">250<D>24</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500<D>33</D><D>35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,000<D>47</D><D>51</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,500<D>75</D><D>86</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,000<D>108</D><D>134</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7,500<D>134</D><D>176</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,000<D>157</D><D>218</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15,000<D>197</D><D>298</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20,000<D>232</D><D>(X)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30,000<D>297</D><D>(X)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40,000<D>356</D><D>(X)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50,000<D>413</D><D>(X)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">70,000<D>522</D><D>(X)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100,000<D>679</D><D>(X)</D><F>(X) Not Applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table A-3._Standard Errors of Estimated Percentages for Health InsuranceCoverage</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Total or white]</ITAG><H1>Base of estimated percentage (thousands)</H1><H1>Estimated percentage</H1><H2>1 or 99</H2><H2>2 or 98</H2><H2>5 or 95</H2><H2>10 or 90</H2><H2>20 or 80</H2><H2>25 or 75</H2><H2>50</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">75<D>1.7</D><D>2.4</D><D>3.7</D><D>5.2</D><D>6.9</D><D>7.4</D><D>8.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100<D>1.5</D><D>2.1</D><D>3.2</D><D>4.5</D><D>6.0</D><D>6.4</D><D>7.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">250<D>.9</D><D>1.3</D><D>2.1</D><D>2.8</D><D>3.8</D><D>4.1</D><D>4.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500<D>.7</D><D>.9</D><D>1.5</D><D>2.0</D><D>2.7</D><D>2.9</D><D>3.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,000<D>.5</D><D>.7</D><D>1.0</D><D>1.4</D><D>1.9</D><D>2.0</D><D>2.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,500<D>.3</D><D>.4</D><D>.6</D><D>.9</D><D>1.2</D><D>1.3</D><D>1.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,000<D>.2</D><D>.3</D><D>.5</D><D>.6</D><D>.8</D><D>.9</D><D>1.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7,500<D>.2</D><D>.2</D><D>.4</D><D>.5</D><D>.7</D><D>.7</D><D>.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,000<D>.1</D><D>.2</D><D>.3</D><D>.4</D><D>.6</D><D>.6</D><D>.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25,000<D>.09</D><D>.1</D><D>.2</D><D>.3</D><D>.4</D><D>.4</D><D>.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50,000<D>.07</D><D>.09</D><D>.1</D><D>.2</D><D>.3</D><D>.3</D><D>.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100,000<D>.05</D><D>.07</D><D>.1</D><D>.1</D><D>.2</D><D>.2</D><D>.2</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>8,L2,i1,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10</C><T4>Table A-4._Standard Errors of Estimated Percentages for Health InsuranceCoverage</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Black and Hispanic origin]</ITAG><H1>Base of estimated percentage (thousands)</H1><H1>Estimated percentage</H1><H2>1 or 99</H2><H2>2 or 98</H2><H2>5 or 95</H2><H2>10 or 90</H2><H2>20 or 80</H2><H2>25 or 75</H2><H2>50</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">75<D>1.8</D><D>2.5</D><D>3.9</D><D>5.4</D><D>7.2</D><D>7.7</D><D>8.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100<D>1.5</D><D>2.2</D><D>3.4</D><D>4.6</D><D>6.2</D><D>6.7</D><D>7.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">250<D>1.0</D><D>1.4</D><D>2.1</D><D>2.9</D><D>3.9</D><D>4.2</D><D>4.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500<D>.7</D><D>1.0</D><D>1.5</D><D>2.1</D><D>2.8</D><D>3.0</D><D>3.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,000<D>.5</D><D>.7</D><D>1.1</D><D>1.5</D><D>2.0</D><D>2.1</D><D>2.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,500<D>.3</D><D>.4</D><D>.7</D><D>.9</D><D>1.2</D><D>1.3</D><D>1.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,000<D>.2</D><D>.3</D><D>.5</D><D>.7</D><D>.9</D><D>.9</D><D>1.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7,500<D>.2</D><D>.2</D><D>.4</D><D>.5</D><D>.7</D><D>.8</D><D>.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10,000<D>.2</D><D>.2</D><D>.3</D><D>.5</D><D>.6</D><D>.7</D><D>.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15,000<D>.1</D><D>.2</D><D>.3</D><D>.4</D><D>.5</D><D>.5</D><D>.6</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18365 Filed 8-7-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-29-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
