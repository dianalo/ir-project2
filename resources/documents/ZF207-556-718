The short answer is also the most inexpensive.andP;  Dashingout and spending lots Of money on security products is a complete waste,unless a lot of time has been spent drinking about the type of disaster(man-made or otherwise) which could occur.andM;At the lowest level, computer security solutions aim to prevent a PC beingstolen or damaged.andP;  Various locks and safes are marketed which can help toprevent such problems.andP;  They are sold by most of the companies which selfcomputer consumables, or if you really want to be secure, phone a safemakingcompany.andP;  It is then vital that any disks are adequately controlled.andP;  Thereis no point in installing security product and then letting users import andexport disks to their hearts' content.andM;The next area is hiding the information stored on a PC from anyone whoshouldn't be allowed access.andP;  The cheapest way to do this is to lock the PCaway when it is not in use.andP;  I would strongly advise anyone to consider thiscourse of action before purchasing security products.andP;  It costs almostnothing.andM;Beyond these simple measures there is a whole range of products which hidethe content of a file using encryption techniques.andP;  (Encryption is writinginformation to file in a form that is unreadable unless the reverse processof decryption is applied to the file).andP;  Many products offer such acapability, and it can be a very effective way of safeguarding importantinformation.andM;One step better than hiding just the information, is to prevent anunauthorized user gaining access to the PC in die first place.andP;  The jargonfor this is 'Access Control'.andP;  Access control is usually enforced by a systemwhich takes control at power on, and forces users to sign on with an ID and asecret password.andP;  If a PC is connected to a network, then the access con- isa complete waste, unless a lot of time has been spent thinking about the typeof disaster (man-made or otherwise) which could occur.andM;At the lowest level, computer security solutions aim to prevent a PC beingstolen or damaged.andP;  Various locks and safes are marketed which can help toprevent such problems.andP;  They are sold by most of the companies which selfcomputer consumables, or if you really want to be secure, phone a safemakingcompany.andP;  It is then vital that any disks are adequately controlled.andP;  Thereis no point in installling a security product and then letting users importand export disks to their hearts' content.andM;The next area is hiding the informaation stored on a PC from anyone whoshouldn't be allowed access.andP;  The cheapest way to do this is to lock the PCaway when it is not in use.andP;  I would strongly advise anyone to consider thiscourse of action before purchasing security products.andP;  It costs almostnothing.andM;Beyond these simple measures there is a whole range of products which hidethe content of a file using encyption techniques.andP;  (Encryption is writinginformation to file in a form that is unreadable unless the reverse processof decryption is applied to the file).andP;  Many products offer such acapabability, and it can be a very effective way of safeguarding importantinformation.andM;One step better than hiding just the information, is to prevent anunauthorized user gaining access to the PC in die first place.andP;  The jargonfor this is 'Access Control'.andP;  Access control is usually enforced by a systemwhich takes control at power on, and forces users to sign on with an ID and asecret password.andP;  If a PC is connected to a network, then the access con-trolfile encryption system must be available on every K attached to thenetwork, as a chain is only as strong as its weakest fink.andP;  The main problemwith doing this is financial rather than technical.andP;  As the survey datashows, access control systems can add S,500 to the cost of every PC on dienetwork.andM;Computer viruses have recently gained a lot of publicity as examples ofmalicious programs that can destroy files and propagate throughout a system.andO;Because of die infinite number of ways a virus can work within the operatingsystem of your PC, and the many different types of viruses that are known toexist already, the security products which purport to remove viruses aredubious unless you know that a specific type of virus abounds.andP;  I recommendnone of them.andP;  The only practical defence to a virus attack is to ensure thatthe virus does not gain entry in the first place.andP;  This means only usingsoftware obtained from reputable sources, and regularly checking die K.andO;Security products are available that can test for alterations made by a virus(or any other type of program) by scanning a disk for changes made since thedisk was last checked.andP;  They can be useful preventative medicine.andM;I hope to have explained some of the objectives, and what some of die jargonmeans.andP;  Which products are actually worth buying?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
