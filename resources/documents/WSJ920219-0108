A top federal court official granted U.S. District JudgeMilton Pollack of New York the extraordinary power to dividethe settlement among government regulators, aggrievedinvestors and others with claims against the former officialsof Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;People will know that I'm where the honey pot is,&quot; JudgePollack said in an interview yesterday. He added that heexpected the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and lawyers forinvestors to provide him with a proposal for splitting thefunds.   The judge's key role in distributing the money mirrors hispivotal role in prodding the parties to reach a preliminarysettlement agreement Friday. Under its terms, Mr. Milken, thejailed former Drexel junk-bond chief, will be responsible forproviding $900 million, another $300 million will come fromDrexel employee partnerships and officers' insurers will addabout $100 million.   The agreement will dispose of suits by thrift regulatorsand hundreds of individuals who have alleged that Mr. Milkenmanipulated the market for high-risk, high-yield junk bondsand undermined the health of certain savings and loans. Mr.Milken has consistently denied the allegations and won'tadmit them as part of any settlement.   Asked if he thought it was unfair that Mr. Milken wouldstill be left with control of at least $500 million after thesettlement, Judge Pollack said, &quot;It's unfair to think that heshould contribute any more to the settlement.&quot; Judge Pollackalso said he would not play to &quot;idle curiosity&quot; and makepublic a list of assets that Mr. Milken's attorneys haveprovided to him.   A spokesman for the FDIC said that its share of thesettlement will go to the FDIC account in the U.S. Treasuryto reimburse the government for money spent paying depositorsof failed savings and loans.   To facilitate division of the anticipated fund, Judge JohnF. Nangle, chairman of the federal multidistrict litigationpanel, on Friday ordered that all federal lawsuits related tothe activities of Mr. Milken and other former Drexelemployees be placed under Judge Pollack's jurisdiction.   In addition, two plaintiffs' lawyers yesterday filed a newclass action that covers all current and potential claimsagainst Mr. Milken and former Drexel employees for theiractivities while working at the former investment bankingpowerhouse. The class action covers activities at Drexel from1978 through 1991.   Judge Pollack said that both the order from the federalpanel and the class action are designed to make sure that thesettlement with Mr. Milken and others puts an end to allDrexel-related lawsuits.   Previously, more than 160 state and federal lawsuits hadbeen scattered in courts around the country. Before the newclass action was devised, it had been thought that lawyersfor non-government plaintiffs would have to apply to allthose courts in order to get approval of settlement amountsapplicable to each suit. That will no longer be necessary,lawyers said.   Instead, two committees will be set up, probablycomprising lawyers and outside experts. The committees willallocate the money based on the strength of individualclaims. Judge Pollack will reserve the right to make finaldeterminations.   While most of the settlement money will go to people whoclaim that they were damaged financially by wrongdoing atDrexel, about $75 million is expected to go to Drexel's fixedcreditors, including banks, former employees and suppliers towhom the firm owes money. Because most of this fund wasalready anticipated, the settlement isn't expected to addmuch to the 50 to 75 cents on the dollar that variouscreditors are expected to get in Drexel's bankruptcy-lawreorganization.   The settlement does aid the bankruptcy reorganization,however, by requiring Mr. Milken and his brother, formerDrexel official Lowell Milken, to drop more than $300 millionof claims that they had brought against Drexel. This probablywill mean that the estate will be able to distribute money toother former employees of Drexel more quickly.   While Judge Pollack, 85 years old, will get all suitsrelating to Mr. Milken and other former Drexel employees, hesaid he will return to the original courts the parts of thesuits involving people not formerly employed by Drexel. Thismeans plaintiffs' lawyers will be able to continue pursuingDrexel-related suits against some individual defendants andaccounting, law and consulting firms linked to Drexeltransactions in the 1980s.   Meanwhile, lawyers representing the various sides beganmeeting yesterday in an effort to shape the language of theactual settlement expected to be presented March 2 to JudgePollack for approval. At the heart of these discussions aretechnical but pivotal issues such as how to structure theescrow account in which the Drexel employee partnershipsinterests, to be included in the settlement pot, will remainwhile the settlement is being paid.</TEXT></DOC>
