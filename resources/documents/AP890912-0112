(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three Mile Island plant operators shouldbe allowed to boil away 2.3 million gallons of radioactive waterleft over from the nation's worst nuclear accident, the NuclearRegulatory Commission staff says.   The staff Monday amended the Unit 2 reactor license to allow theprocess, concluding there would be no ``significant effect on thequality of the human environment.''   The full NRC will vote on evaporation procedures in six weeks.   GPU Nuclear Corp. has said the water contains radioactive tritiumand trace amounts of cesium 137 and strontium 90. The three isotopescannot be completely removed from the water and will be releasedinto the atmosphere during evaporation.   The plant operator has said it hopes to begin the two-year, $4million process in November. The water has been stored since theMarch 1979 accident, when the Unit 2 reactor lost cooling water andhalf the radioactive core melted.   Two citizens groups, Susquehanna Valley Alliance and Three MileIsland Alert, contend that any further release of radiation would behazardous.</TEXT></DOC>
