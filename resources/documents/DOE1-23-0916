Projects arecategorized as boiler/steam turbine, gas turbine, engine, and alternativeenergy - including hydroelectric, geothermal, and wind systems. A totalof 83 projects are listed and described to give you an idea of the typesof systems and fuels being used for cogeneration and the regional characteristicsof the industry. Over 600 applications were on file at FERC at the beginningof September. Last year, there were close to 1000 projects filed at thattime. Based on past experience, less than half of these announced projects,and some say less than 30%, can be expected to be completed. In reviewingwhat the data mean, keep in mind that the 1340-MW Midland (Mich) combined-cycleproject, a converted nuclear-plant site, skews the statistics so, inmost cases, trends are reported with and without this project included.Also, all figures should be considered relative to each other, and noton an absolute basis.</TEXT></DOC>
