The move was outlined in a memorandum sent to the group's 8,100 employees by Lawrence Perlman, president of Data Storage Products, one of Control Data's core businesses. The memo didn't indicate when the separation might occur. It said &quot;the new company will maintain close links with Control Data both in terms of day-to-day management and strategic planning.&quot;    Mr. Perlman couldn't be reached for elaboration, but a Control Data spokesman said the step will allow the company to &quot;explore the full spectrum of opportunities for data-storage products, including joint ventures, partnerships, acquisitions or divestiture.&quot;    In recent months senior Control Data executives have acknowledged debating whether to retain the disk-drive business, once among the company's biggest and most profitable. Data storage still accounts for nearly a third of Control Data's sales -- revenue last year was $974.5 million -- but intense competition from Japanese manufacturers has turned it into a thin-margin commodity-like business fundamentally different from Control Data's other ventures.    Moreover, since recovering from huge losses in the mid-1980s, the Minneapolis-based computer hardware and services concern has increasingly been concentrating on developing its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer-manufacturing unit and a number of higher-margin data-services businesses, such as the Ticketron automated-wagering and SAMI/Burke market-research operations.    Making data storage a stand-alone unit presumably would give it more opportunity to obtain outside financing.    While Control Data was a pioneer in developing disk and tape drives and other computer-storage devices, the group grew lax and its technology lagged in the early 1980s, contributing much of the company's financial problems.    Only recently has Data Storage returned to profitability, under Mr. Perlman's guidance. That process included slashing the work force from about 20,000 and moving some manufacturing overseas. A corporate executive vice president and company director, Mr. Perlman previously had run the Commercial Credit Co. financial services business before Control Data spun it off, in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
