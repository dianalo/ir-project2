Lee Hamilton, the latest in the parade of vice presidentialcandidates. Vice President George Bush said he would not apologizeto Iran for the U.S. military action that left 290 civilians dead.   En route to Dallas for a speech to Hispanic leaders, Bush wasasked by reporters if the United States should apologize forshooting down an Iranian civilian plane. ``No, but we probablyought to do what we did, which is to officially express regret,which I guess should happen when you have the loss of innocentlife.''   But as for an apology, Bush said, ``I wouldn't. Because of thefacts, what happened.''   Dukakis wrapped up another round in his search for a vicepresidential running mate, meeting in Boston with Hamilton, whotold reporters afterward, ``I would accept it, first of all, if hethought I could be helpful.'' Hamilton won praise for his handlingof the select Iran-Contra committee and has been advising Dukakisinformally on foreign policy.   Dukakis' efforts in choosing a vice presidential candidateoccurred against the backdrop of a budget crisis at home inMassachusetts. The money crunch forced him to agree to new taxes _an issue that was quickly seized upon by the Republicans.   Dukakis also came under criticism from President Reagan, who onTuesday also gave the vice president his strongest vote ofconfidence yet.   Bush is ``the kind of man I want to follow me,'' Reagan told agroup of conservatives at the Old Executive Office Building. Hesaid Bush would continue the conservative revolution begun underReagan.   Bush was traveling to his adopted home state of Texas today fora meeting of the League of United Latin-American Citizens, thelargest Hispanic civil rights organization in the country.   Dukakis on Tuesday brought in Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennesseeand Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri for face-to-face talks inBoston. Gephardt said he'd take the job if it were offered, butGore would not comment.   The former Dukakis rivals treated him harshly during the heat ofthe primary campaign but both eventually endorsed the Massachusettsgovernor.   Dukakis is also to travel to Arizona Friday to meet with anotherformer rival, Bruce Babbitt. Aides said Dukakis was seekingBabbitt's advice but was not considering him for the vicepresidential nomination.   Jesse Jackson, who spent the July Fourth holiday with Dukakis,dismissed contenders other than himself.   ``The others under consideration are unknown quantities beyondtheir districts and beyond their home states,'' Jackson said inBoston before leaving for New York, where he was holding a seriesof editorial board meetings today.   The private sessions with prospective running mates fueledspeculation that the certain Democratic nominee was moving closerto naming a second.   While Dukakis conducted interviews at home, his closest adviser,Paul Brountas, began a four-day stay in Washington. Campaign aidessaid Brountas was conducting research on the vice presidentialcontenders and talking with party leaders.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's resignation Tuesday waswelcome news to the Bush campaign, which viewed the attorneygeneral's legal problems as a liability. Although Bush neverpublicly criticized Meese or called for his resignation, he issueda statement saying: ``Ed did the right thing and I wish him well.''   Dukakis, who has frequently made an issue of ethics problems inthe Reagan administration, called the Meese resignation longoverdue.   ``This administration's inability to set high standards forpublic service will not be solved by the Meese resignation,'' hesaid. ``This administration has had one scandal after another, oneresignation after another.''   Dukakis in turn came under fire from Reagan, who in addressingthe conservatives referred to Dukakis not by name but as ``agovernor.'' It was clear which governor he was talking about,though.   ``The American people understand what liberalism means and don'tlike it, so our opponents plan to go to the voters incognito _they're putting on political trenchcoats and sunglasses,'' Reagansaid, referring to the sparse Democratic platform, described byRepublicans as deliberately vague.   ``How other than liberal would you characterize a governor whoin the last five years increased his state's spending twice as fastas the federal government's and more than a third faster than theaverage for all the other states?'' Reagan asked.   Dukakis, while trying to find a running mate, also is facing oneof the most serious budget crises of his career as governor ofMassachusetts and met Tuesday with legislators in his Statehouseoffice.   Although fiscal year 1988 expired last Thursday, there is stillno plan in place to close the year-end deficit. Senate Ways andMeans Chairwoman Patricia McGovern confirmed Tuesday that the 1988budget is at least $450 million in deficit, due to disappointingtax collections in June.   There is also no budget in place for the new fiscal year, makingit difficult for the administration to run the government.   Democratic officials, meanwhile, are discussing a plan underwhich Jackson would give a prime time televised speech on thesecond night of the party's national convention, as would the otherDemocrats who lost out to Dukakis in the fight for the party'spresidential nomination.   Under the outline, former President Jimmy Carter would speakduring prime time on Monday night, the same evening as a keynotespeech by Texas treasurer Ann Richards and remarks by partychairman Paul Kirk, according to officials who spoke only oncondition of anonymity.   Kirk met Tuesday with representatives of Dukakis' and Jackson'scampaigns. But Ron Brown, who is heading Jackson's conventionoperation, said ``the decision is that we have no present intentionof dropping any'' of the outstanding platform issues which Jacksonhas threatened to carry to the convention floor.</TEXT></DOC>
