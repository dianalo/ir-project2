Failuremode analysis involving possible short circuits is conceptually straightforward,but tedious in multiple coil system because of the necessity for combiningfield analysis, parameter determinations (inductances), transient cirucitanalyses, and failure condition estimated. SHORTFORCE is set of FORTRANprograms that is designed to aid in model construction (e.g. short definition),circuit parameter calculations and display of output currents, fields,and forces, etc. The program is described and an example case presentedwith comparisons with measured data from a shorted superconducting coil.</TEXT></DOC>
