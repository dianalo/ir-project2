Faulty wiring in the signal system was the immediate cause ofthe disaster during the morning rush hour Dec. 12, said Sir AnthonyHidden, the judge who headed the inquiry. The fault caused a signalto remain green although a train was stopped just beyond it.   In addition to the dead, more than 100 people were injured whenone commuter train rammed the rear of a stopped commuter train,outside busy Clapham Junction in south London. The wreckage wasthen struck by a freight train.   Hidden said the signal failure reflected a deterioration of the``safety culture'' in the state-owned rail system.   ``The relevant errors include the facts that working practiceswere permitted to slip to unacceptable and dangerous standards,''Hidden's report said.   ``The quality of supervision was permitted to slip to anequivalent degree so that those unacceptable and dangerous workingpractices were allowed to continue.''   Among 93 recommendations to improve safety, Hidden called forpriority in installing radios in the cabs of trains and installingairline-style ``black boxes,'' and more research on improvingrolling stock to protect passengers in the event of an accident.   Within the signals department, Hidden called for radicalimprovement in recruiting and training, and an end to excessiveovertime.   Technicians testified at a public hearing that they worked longhours and days off because of a shortage of qualified staff.   After the report was released, Clifford Hale resigned as qualitymanager for the British Railways Board. He was the regionalsignaling engineer at the time of the accident.   Hidden's report said Hale made the ``dangerous assumption'' thatonce a problem was identified, it would be fixed. ``The problemabout Mr. Hale's management was that it demonstrated the lack ofcommunication which pervaded the signals and telecommunicationsdepartment,'' the report said.   ``I accept all the inquiry's recommendations here and now,''said British Rail's chairman, Sir Robert Reid. ``We have takensteps to ensure that the circumstances that led to this tragedy cannever be repeated on British Railways.''   Reid said more than $32 million has been spent solving problemsidentified following the Clapham disaster.</TEXT></DOC>
