The unusual request by the Illinois Democrat signals that Congress still isn't close to passing a technical-corrections bill. At a hearing yesterday, Rep. Rostenkowski asked Assistant Treasury Secretary Don Chapoton to treat the technical corrections as if they had passed for taxpayers who are waiting for the corrections in filling out this year's returns and making business decisions. Mr. Chapoton said he would consider the request.    The tax-writing committees have been trying to put together a technical corrections package for more than a year. They still face difficulties, because of the desire of many lawmakers to tack on assorted measures to help specific constituents or industries.    Rep. Rostenkowski said that the Treasury had given such extralegal validity last year for corrections, still not enacted, in the tax-exempt bond area. He said he wanted similar action to be taken this year for all who need technical corrections rather than for certain segments selected by the Treasury. </TEXT></DOC>
