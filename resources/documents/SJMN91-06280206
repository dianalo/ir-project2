For them, castles and otherrelics of the Middle Ages are to be found, if not in their own back yards, atleast as close as a ride in the countryside. Although Europe is filled withsuch dreamland creations, our choice is the &quot;Romantische Strasse,&quot; or RomanticRoad, a scenic route that follows a twisting, 180-mile course from Wurzburg,in south-central Germany, to Fussen, at the foot of the Alps on the Austrianborder. The route is aptly named, for along it lie some of the most romantic-- and intact -- medieval-era towns in Europe.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ONCE UPON A TIMEROMANTIC ROAD OFFERS TRIP THROUGH REAL, FAIRY TALEHISTORY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Back Roads  </MEMO><TEXT>     The entire Romantic Road can be covered in a day on a guided bus tour. Butit's better, if time and funds permit, to take several days and travel theroute by car, stopping when the mood strikes.;   Chief among places to visitis Rothenburg-ob-der-Tauber, a veritable museum of antiquity that isconsidered one of the finest medieval cities in Europe.;   Rothenburg, whichdates from the seventh century, reached the apex of its prosperity as a freeimperial city in the 14th century and still contains, within its undamagedGothic and Renaissance walls, a treasure trove of completely preservedmedieval buildings.;   Stroll over what used to be the moat (it's filled innow, and sections of it are used for parking) and through the massive citygates that open onto the Old Town, and you'll think you've walked straightinto a story by the Brothers Grimm.;   Continue on down the Romantic Road,through bucolic farmland where grain and grapes are grown, and you'll comefirst to Dinkelsbuhl and then to Nordlingen, two other irresistible townsdating from medieval times.;   Both still are encircled by well-preservedfortifications from the 14th and 15th centuries. In Nordlingen, you can walkcompletely around the town, past 18 towers and gates, on the covered parapet.;  The largest city on the Romantic Road -- indeed, the only population centerlarge enough to be called a city -- is Augsburg, which was settled about 2,000years ago and has been important throughout its history.;   In the 15th and16th centuries it was the wealthiest city in Europe. Although 80 percent ofAugsburg's buildings were destroyed by Allied bombing in World War II, thebulk of its art treasures were saved, and a wealth of Renaissance buildings --many of them painstakingly restored -- remain. Among places of interest arethe High Cathedral, containing the oldest stained-glass windows in the world;and Mozarthaus, home of Leopold Mozart, father of the musical genius.;   Southof Augsburg, the look of the countryside undergoes a subtle change and thejoyful architecture of Bavaria begins to appear. Here many of the houses havebroad, chalet-style eaves and are painted with decorative frescoes.;   Windowboxes bursting with blooms hang from every shop and house. Go into arestaurant and you'll likely be seated in a slat-back chair with heart-shapedcutouts that appears to have been lifted straight from an illustration in&quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears.&quot;;   Tucked into the hills below Augsburg aremore towns -- Landsberg am Lech, Schongau, Rottenbuch, Steingaden -- worthy ofexploration.;   By the time you come to Fussen, at the southern end of theRomantic Road, the Bavarian Alps, rising tall and abrupt on the horizon,dominate every view. An intriguing town in its own right, Fussen is betterknown as the gateway to one of Germany's best known sights, the castle ofNeuschwanstein, built by the extravagant King Ludwig II (often called &quot;MadKing Ludwig&quot;) in the 1880s.;   Neuschwanstein is a soaring fantasy of towersand turrets perched on a mountainside aerie, and if it looks familiar it'sbecause Walt Disney used it as a model for the Sleeping Beauty Castle hedesigned as the centerpiece of Disneyland.;   Tens of thousands of touristseach year tour Neuschwanstein and a neighboring castle, Hohenschwangau, builtby Ludwig's father.;   The parking lots that accommodate visitors' cars arenothing short of enormous. You can take a shuttle bus to the top of the hillwhere Neuschwanstein is situated (it's still a 10-minute walk to the castle),but the most romantic way to go is by carriage, which costs 6 marks (about $4)for the ascent and 3 marks (about $2) for the descent -- unless they've raisedthe prices.;   Fussen is just a two-hour drive from Munich, Germany's mostpopular tourist destination. But the pull of the Bavarian countryside isstrong, and one of its most attractive (if touristy) magnets is nearbyOberammergau, known for the famous Passion Play that has been put on by thetownspeople once a decade, in years ending with zero, since 1680.;   From hereit's just a short drive to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Mittenwald, a pair ofpicturesque, year-round resorts nestled beneath snow-capped Alpine peaks.;  Vast networks of hiking trails in the area are enjoyed by Germans (some ofwhom wear traditional Bavarian lederhosen) and foreigners alike. Several skilifts operate in the summer months, making spectacular views available tothose who don't want to walk up.;   When touring the Romantic Road andBavaria, it is best, perhaps, to save the hustle-bustle of Munich for last. Ifyou've only a day or two to spend in this most colorful of German cities, anda tight budget to do it on, consider avoiding Munich's astronomical hotelrates by basing yourself in a suburb (we chose Gauting, on the southwestoutskirts of the city) and taking the S-bahn commuter train into the city.;  Head first to Marienplatz, the cobbled square at the city's heart dominated bythe 19th-century Neus Rathaus (new town hall). In the tower of the building isan elaborate glockenspiel whose mechanical figures move as the clock chimesand music plays at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily.;   Marienplatz in summer isfilled with tables where working people and tourists alike come to drink beerand eat lunch in the sunshine.;   But a better idea for lunch is to walk a fewblocks to the Viktualienmarkt, the city's open-air food market, where acres oftables are available, the beer comes in liter glasses and the stalls selleverything from liverwurst and sauerkraut to Brie and pate.;   There's no endof diversion to be found in this vibrant city, but beer-sampling certainlyranks right up there. It is said there are more than 400 beer gardens inMunich. That may be true, but if you've only time to visit one, and don't minda boisterous atmosphere, make it the Hofbrauhaus.;   As many as 4,000 beerdrinkers crowd into this granddaddy of German beer halls every night. Costumedoompah bands pump out music that barely can be heard above the din, and everyso often people at the long tables start swaying and singing traditionalbeer-drinking songs.;   If you can't be in Munich during Oktoberfest, theHofbrauhaus will at least provide you with a sample of what it's like.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; For more information on the Romantic Road and Bavaria,contact a travel agent or request brochures from the German National TouristOffice, 444 S.
