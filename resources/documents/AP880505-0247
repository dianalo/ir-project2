(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A day after a state lawmaker turned up twophantom workers in the Treasury Department, Treasurer Robert Bowmanannounced Thursday that he was firing the ghostly bureaucrats.   Bowman said the practice of signing phony names on letters totaxpayers had worked well for years, but he no longer could defendthe policy because it hurt the agency's credibility with the public.   ``Today at three o'clock we received the resignation of ScottShepard and Susan, Sally, what was the other one's name, SusanStadler?'' Bowman told reporters at a whimsical press briefing inhis conference room.   ``I had a hard time defending to myself why we do it,'' Bowmansaid, noting that the policy began about 1981, two years before hetook office.   State Rep. Mat Dunaskiss had called a news conference Wednesdayto complain that a constituent received warning letters signed byTreasury Department employees Susan Sadler and Scott Shepard,neither of whom exist.   Bowman, who said he first learned of policy two weeks ago,originally defended it Wednesday as a way to speed up the handlingof taxpayer calls.   On Thursday, he explained: ``The problem we've run into in thepast is they've (taxpayers) asked for the person who signed theletter and the supervisor's not there ... that's when they startplaying telephone tag. They want to talk to the person who signedthe letter. We're hopeful we will be able to overcome that.''   Reporters had been told they would be attending a ``funeral''for the two ghost employees, and Dunaskiss got into the spirit,playfully presenting Bowman with a bouquet of flowers.   ``Your sensitivity as always to these employees isoverwhelming,'' Bowman said with a laugh. ``I greatly appreciatethat. We will send it on to their respective families.''   On a more serious note, Dunaskiss said he was pleased the policywas dropped quickly. He had described it as ``a serious breach ofpublic trust.''   He handed reporters a picture of a tombstone with an inscriptionreading: ``Here lies Susan andamp; Scott. We thought they were, but theywere not. We hope they eternally rest in peace and taxpayersharassment will finally cease.''   Bowman said it's common for consumer-oriented businesses acrossthe nation to use the phony names to speed up service, but said healso realized the state should behave differently.   ``We were not trying to dodge taxpayers. To the contrary, wewere serving taxpayers well. But I just couldn't dodge theaccountability angle. Because if Scott Shepard does exist, peopleought to be able to come here and see Scott Shepard,'' he said.   Bowman said he didn't know how many phony names his departmentused during the past eight years.   From now on, all taxpayer letters will be signed by the divisionsupervisors with a note on the bottom for callers to ask for aspecific division, Bowman said.   Dunaskiss said the treasury department wasn't the first inMichigan to be found to have ``ghost'' employees.   ``People were shocked a few months ago when a ghost named FredJohnson surfaced in the Department of Natural Resources. Now we'vefound ghosts in the area of tax collection,'' Dunaskiss had saidWednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
