The distributioncharacteristics of each applicator were tested and optimized. Experimentswere conducted in the laboratory to determine the effectiveness of thetreating agents when applied by these systems. The results are similarto those of previous studies and showed that the applicators could effectivelydistribute the agents onto oil spilled on water. The applicators wereused during four days of tests performed in a large scale wave basin.The results from these tests are discussed. Slicks treated with the demoussifierhad lower water content. Oil recoverablility, as determined by use ofa skimmer, was decreased by demoussifier treatment, but this could beremedied by adding Elastol. The application of Elastol rendered oil viscoelasticand thus enhanced oil recoverability by a skimmer. A slick treated with4,000 ppM Elastol proved to be insufficiently thick to propagate burning.2 refs., 14 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
