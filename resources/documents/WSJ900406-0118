But he said shareholders &quot;ought not to look for&quot; profitsuntil 1991 or 1992, after the company's restructuring iscompleted.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Karp succeeded Cineplex's founder and former chairman,Garth Drabinsky, in December after Mr. Drabinsky quit thecompany after his failure to launch a takeover bid for theToronto-based theater-distribution chain.   Mr. Karp's current task is to reduce, through asset salesand other measures, the debt built up by Mr. Drabinsky duringan aggressive expansion in the late 1980s, and return thecompany to profitability.   He said that in the first quarter the company saw a nearly20% increase in revenue from box office admissions andconcessions from a year earlier.   &quot;Our {operating} revenues are outstripping both 1989figures and our budgets,&quot; Mr. Karp said. &quot;This will trickledown to the bottom line.&quot;   Improved relations with major film studios also meansCineplex won't be shut out of distributing high-grossingfilms this year, as happened in 1988 and 1989, he added.   Although Mr. Karp said he expects to see positive cashflow by the end of the year, he declined to quantify it,saying it would be affected by what assets are sold, and whenthe sales are concluded.   Cineplex already has &quot;very attractive offers&quot; for some ofits theater chains, Mr. Karp said, and is negotiating thepossible sale of, among others, theaters in Virgina, Oregonand Washington state.   He said he expects Cineplex to receive around seven oreight times cash flow for the properties. Most analysts sayeight times cash flow is the maximum any buyer is willing topay in the current buyer's market.   Cineplex may report losses on the sale of some of thechains, but Mr. Karp said he expects &quot;some very large gainson other sales&quot; to result in a net benefit to the company.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,Cineplex closed at $5.50, up 50 cents.   Asset sales will help to cut Cineplex's debt, whichreached a high of $620 million in the first quarter, tobetween $400 and $500 million by year end, he said.   Mr. Karp said the company is eyeing a number of ways torefinance its debt load, including the possible sale andleaseback of some of its theaters. Other options under studyinclude a joint venture partnership with another company, orstand-alone financing arrangements for some of the individualtheater chains. He didn't identify any potential partners.   The key to returning the company to profitability, Mr.Karp said, is keeping a tight rein on capital spending andother expenses. Cineplex's capital spending budget will belimited to $12 million in 1990, he said, although underagreements with its bankers the company is able to spend upto $17.5 million refurbishing and building new theaters thisyear.   He said general and administrative expenses are expectedto drop from $35 million in 1989 to less than $22 millionthis year.   Mr. Karp said that in 1991 &quot;we will be reaping thebenefits&quot; of the restructuring efforts and begin showingprofits again.</TEXT></DOC>
