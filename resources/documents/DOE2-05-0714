It is generally accepted that such erosionis attributable to the presence of water condensed in the last stagesof the turbine when the steam crosses the saturation line. The heavywater droplets strike the back portion of the next row of moving blades,giving rise to high localized surface stresses which cause gradual breakdownof the material. This erosion is a time bound process and no mathematicalformula is yet available in the existing literature. An account of someof the factors which control the rate of erosion of the blades is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
