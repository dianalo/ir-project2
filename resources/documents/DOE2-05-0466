The analysis shows that the majorityof these events is produced in central collisions. But, it is also observedthat no negligible part of them originates from peripheral collisionsand has one heavy and two light fragments (2 andless; Z/sub L/ andless; 20). This indicatesthat various mechanisms contribute to the production of light fragmentsin high energy nuclear interactions.</TEXT></DOC>
