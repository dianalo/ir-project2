Considerable mortality rates may occur, both of the fish caughton the cooling-water screens and of the larvae passing through the cooling-watercircuit from the intake to the outfall. Possible consequences of thesemortality rates for the fish population seem rather difficult to establish.A sampling programme of impinged fish form the cooling-water screensfor eight power stations showed that the numbers of impinged fish werehighest at the Bergum power station (situated at a lake) and lower atthe river power stations. Experiments on preventing fish from enteringthe cooling-water intakes were carried out with light, air bubbles, electricalscreens and orientation objects. The overall results were not very promising.Additional light experiments are now being carried out with silver eel,a fish that demonstrates a clear avoidance reaction for light. Lightbarriers might therefore be effective in deflecting eel from water intakesof both thermal and hydropower stations. It is therefore recommended,in order to minimize the potential damage to fish at future thermal powerstations, that special measures be taken with respect to the constructionof cooling-water intake devices. 10 figs., 22 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
