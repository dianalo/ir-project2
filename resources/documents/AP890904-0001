The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nationsproposal to swap some of its $112-billion foreign debt forinvestments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain andWest Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly byburning, to the huge rain forest.   In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for localauthorities to police the jungle. Then it said yes to a projectbacked by the United Nations and by private American companies toestablish a 1.1 million-acre protected forest area to produce rubberand nuts.   The moves represent a sharp reversal in President Jose Sarney'sAmazon policy, which in the past considered offers by foreigners asattempts to take control of the rain forest from Brazil.   ``We cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want tocreate here,'' Sarney told reporters in March, after France, theNetherlands and two U.S. congressional delegations suggested tradingsome Brazilian foreign debt, the Third World's largest, for Amazonpreservation.   But analysts say subtle shifts in political, social and economicspheres are forcing the government to change its mind.   ``A bit of the persecution complex that took over the government,which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior, is being overcome,opening the road to new initiatives,'' wrote the Brazilian physicistJose Goldemberg in the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper recently.   There is belief here that Sarney, widely discredited for hisinability to check 1,004 percent annual inflation, talked tough inthe past to placate right-wing supporters.   But with his center-right Brazilian Democratic Movement Party insplinters and the country's first popular presidential electionsince 1960 set for Nov. 15, Sarney might now be resigned to acceptforeign aid, the analysts say.   ``What you have is a lame-duck government that lacks thelegitimacy to start new initiatives and push them throughCongress,'' Rene Dreifuss, a political scientist at the FluminenseUniversity in Rio, told The Associated Press. ``It has no choice butto accept help from abroad.''   Equally important, the hostility marking the issue has underminedBrazil's trade links abroad.   ``It started to become taboo to do business in the Amazon,'' Sen.Leopoldo Peres, a member of the Democratic Movement and president ofa Senate committee on Amazon deforestation, said in an interview.``American and European banks and lending organizations startedhesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle.''   Environmentalists pressured the European Economic Community toban imports of iron ore produced at the Greater Carajas project, ahuge metallurgy project in Para, a state in the Amazon region.   Recently, trade officials from Belgium, West Germany and Britainvisited the 200 million-acre, $70 billion project, where thousandsof acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the Amazon Riverare being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore.   A Rio de Janeiro city councilman, Alfredo Sirkis of Brazil'sGreen Party, contends Sarney first stiffened on the Amazon issueunder a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting deathof the acclaimed union leader and ecologist Francisco ``Chico''Mendes.   Mendes, who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down theforest for pasture, was killed last December outside his modest homein a backwoods Amazon town.   ``All of a sudden Chico was all over the front pages, and U.S.senators were showing up to talk about saving the Amazon,'' Sirkissaid. ``It irritated the military, and Sarney reacted by turning itinto a sovereignty issue.''   But the British rock star Sting met with Sarney in January andreceived permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds foran Indian reservation.   In February, Indian tribes of the eastern Amazon Basin organizedthe first national tribal conference, with a goal of blocking WorldBank loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the Amazonregion.   These efforts added to a growing worldwide concern thatuncontrolled tree burning in the 2 million square-mile Amazon forest_ for farming, ranching, highway building and mining _ was changingglobal weather patterns.   Environmentalists contend deforestation of the Amazon also isdestroying unique plant and animal life, much of it unstudied, andeliminating a major source of oxygen for the Earth's atmosphere.   Satellite surveys show that more than 5 percent of Brazil's rainforest has been cut and burned. Some scientists say this adds carbonto the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known asthe greenhouse effect.   By April, the first visible sign of change came when Sarneyannounced a multimillion-dollar plan to preserve the rain forest.   His ``Our Nature'' project extended the suspension of taxincentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fightthe burning. It also established new forest and Indian reservationsand an Environmental Fund, banned timber exports, and controlled thesale of mercury, which is indiscriminately dumped into Amazon-arearivers by freelance gold prospectors.   ``When the hysteria in the press and the government faded, thenationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue,'' Flavio Feldmannof the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, a vocal ecology defender,told a reporter.   On July 5, Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu de Sodre signed amemorandum of understanding with Britain to tackle ``urban andindustrial environmental problems, control of marine pollution, andforestry management.''   ``This cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of statesto administer their natural heritage,'' said Abreu de Sodre.   In August, Brazil accepted $65.5 million in grants and loans fromWest Germany for conservation projects in the Amazon over threeyears.   After this, the Inter-American Development Bank said it wouldstudy the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean.   Many Brazilian politicians now say the country will open up moreto foreign technological and financial help, although some seeminglyremain wary of the so-called ``sovereignty issue.''   But Christopher Patten, Britain's minister of overseasdevelopment, a recent visitor to Brazil, said, ``Environmentalproblems are ... the world's problem, which has to be solved bycooperation and not throwing bricks at each other.''</TEXT></DOC>
