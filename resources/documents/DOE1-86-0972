<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0972 </DOCNO><TEXT>A stabilization system of photomultiplier gain, where light-emitting diodeflashes have been used to obtain a reference signal, is described. Thediode is placed just in the liquid scintilllator volume. The stabilizationsystem contains several (according to the number of photomultipliers)identical channels, which of them consists of a colorimeter, a controltrigger and an integrator with an operational amplifier. Increase ofphotomultiplier stability is reached by changing voltage of photomultiplierpower according to the reference signal amplitude. The level of backgroundand efficiency of neutron detection by a scintillation counter are unchangedwhen using the stabilization system for 10 days of measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
