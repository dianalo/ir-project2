<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0125 </DOCNO><TEXT>A beam position monitor system for the Fermilab Switchyard has been developedto measure positions and intensities for 53.1 MHz RF bunched resonantextracted beams of either 1.5 msec or 20 sec duration. The system hasa position sensitivity of 100 mV/mm with switching between the fast andslow beam electronics during each machine cycle as needed. For 1 1E12proton beam extracted over 20 seconds the system has a final bandwidthof 10 Hz with a SNR of 45 db. For the same intensity beam extracted over1.5 msec, a 10 KJHz bandwidth is maintained with SNR of 70 db.</TEXT></DOC>
