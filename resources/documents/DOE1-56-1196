<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-1196 </DOCNO><TEXT>A statistical analysis of the singularities based on daily temperatureand precipitation series of four selected West German stations and dailyweather conditions has been performed. It includes not only calendarrelated means, but also the skewness of the concerning frequency distributionsas well as the frequencies of defined weather events. The statisticalconcepts showing partly different, but also partly corresponding resultsare compiled containing the date of occurrence, weather character (warm,cold; wet, dry), and significance. In case of the temperature, the anomalyvalues are also given. Some singularities can be associated with specialcirculation types which are also listed including already point to distinctspatial differences, but yet they still require, just as the temporalvariability, some more detailed investigations.</TEXT></DOC>
