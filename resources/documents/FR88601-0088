That determinationstated that the requested documents are not contained in the files at Idaho.Because the original request stated Appellant's belief that the documentsare contained in the files at the Oak Ridge Operations Office (Oak Ridge),the matter was referred to the Freedom of Information Office at Oak Ridge.<ITAG tagnum="84">Remedial Order </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Elk Trading Company and Neal Davis, 2/29/88, HRO-0286</T3>Elk Trading Company (Elk) and Neal Davis (Davis) objected to a PRO issuedjointly to them by the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) on March11, 1985. After considering the respondents' objections, the DOE foundthat the firm had violated the layering regulations set forth in 10 CFR212.186 by reselling crude oil at increased prices without providing theservices traditionally and historically associated with the resale of crudeoil. In addition, the DOE found Neal Davis personally liable for the overcharges,because he conducted, directed and controlled Elk and personally benefittedfrom the layered transactions. Accordingly, the DOE concluded that theProposed Remedial Order should be issued as a final order and directedElk and Davis to remit $11,473,148.92, plus interest, to the DOE.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interlocutory Order </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Economic Regulatory Administration, Kenneth Walker, Southwestern StatesMarketing Corp., 3/388, KRZ-0071, KRR-0034, KRZ-0072, KRZ-0070, KRZ-0068,KRZ-0074, KRX-0041, and KRX-0042</T3>The Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a consolidated decision rulingon a number of motions that had been filed by the Economic Regulatory Administration,Kenneth Walker and Southwestern States Marketing Corp. in an enforcementproceeding based on a Proposed Remedial Order issued jointly to Walkerand Southwestern States. After disposing of a number of minor proceduralmotions, OHA analyzed the voluminous documentary evidence Walker had submittedin support of his contention that he should not be held personally liablefor any overcharges allegedly caused by Southwestern States. Walker maintainedthat the evidence showed that he was not the ``central figure'' involvedin the alleged overcharges. OHA concluded that Walker's documentary evidencefailed to rebut the <T3>prima facie </T3>case established by the ERA. However, OHA determinedthat there was a factual dispute on certain aspects of the nature of Walker'srole in the firm during the audit period. The OHA ordered, <T3>sua sponte, </T3>that an evidentiary hearing be convened at which Walkercould testify concerning the factual dispute about the nature of his rolein Southwestern's crude oil reselling activities, and whether he was the``central figure'' as alleged in the PRO. Provision was also made for thepresentation of oral arguments on the other contested issue at the conclusionof the evidentiary hearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>A.F.
