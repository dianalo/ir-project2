They know that Friedrich Engels once wrotethat &quot;nothing is more dependent on economic conditions thanthe army and the navy.&quot; All of them can recite Lenin byheart: &quot;Military tactics depend on the level of militarytechnology . . .&quot;   Given their creed, and the weak state of the Sovieteconomy, America's victory over Iraq leaves not only SaddamHussein's army in tatters. Without suffering a singlecasualty, the Soviet military has endured its worstpsychological defeat since Afghanistan -- and possibly sinceJune 1941.</LP><TEXT>   Over the past decade, Soviet military thinkers chargedwith worrying about the West have focused their attention onone substance being added to the imperialist arsenal:silicon. At both the strategic and conventional levels,computerization and the development of smart munitions,showed Soviet officials that the revolution in militaryaffairs underway in the capitalist world was bypassing thebureaucratized Soviet economy.   The Pentagon's most recent appraisal in its annual reporton Soviet Military analysis report, Soviet Military Power isthe same: In semiconductor materials, microelectronics,parallel processing, machine intelligence and robotics, andsoftware production, the Soviet Union is &quot;lagging in allimportant aspects.&quot; The lopsided outcome of the Gulf War willconfirm Soviet perceptions of their own backwardness.   This conclusion does not flow from a simple comparison ofthe relative performance of American-made vs. Sovietweaponry. The real issue for Moscow was not the relative, butthe absolute performance of the Western high-tech arsenal.Would these weapons, ordered and designed by the Pentagon todestroy Soviet fighting forces, work?   Over the past weeks the Soviet Union has engaged in anintense effort to answer this question. When the fightingbegan on Jan. 16, the Soviet Union immediately expanded thecoverage provided by its &quot;space assets,&quot; and intensifiedelectronic intelligence surveillance of the area. An&quot;operations group&quot; was established within the Soviet militaryat the general staff level to &quot;gather, generalize and assessthe information&quot; received from the war. Gen. MikhailMoiseyev, the Soviet chief of staff, explained that the GulfWar was a &quot;testing ground for state-of-the-art hardware andarms which are or will in the near future be standardequipment for the NATO bloc's combined armed forces.&quot;   The full findings of the &quot;operations group&quot; are not likelyto be published any time soon in the Soviet press.Nevertheless, statements by military officials during the warand Soviet reporting about the course of battle give a senseof what fears the war has left for Soviet leaders.   &quot;Denial&quot; is an appropriate term to characterize onevisible strand of the Soviet reaction. &quot;The war in the Gulfwill end in a major U.S. defeat,&quot; was the Feb. 1 predictionof Maj. Gen. Viktor Filatov, the controversialeditor-in-chief of the principal military history journal.There is disaffection among U.S. troops, was what other mediaaccounts told Soviet readers. &quot;Our morale is reaching rockbottom,&quot; a U.S. airman was quoted as saying in the Red Armynewspaper Krasnaya Zvezda. &quot;What I see here is particularlydreadful and brutal,&quot; said the unnamed Air Force officer, andthey &quot;will chuck me out if they find out that I have bypassedthe censor and told the truth about this war.&quot;   The American F-15 fighter is no match for top-flightSoviet aircraft, a Soviet pilot told readers of KrasnayaZvezda on Feb. 6. &quot;Even an average pilot in a MiG-29 has morechances of emerging the victor in dogfights than hisadversary in an F-15 not to mention other aircraft.&quot;   Syria's defense minister was also enlisted to tell theSoviet public about American backwardness. The Patriotmissiles and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; technology it employs, are &quot;notthat reliable&quot; in countering Iraqi Scuds, he said. If theU.S. were to &quot;wage Star Wars,&quot;' it would be a &quot;disaster&quot; forAmerica. The American M-16 not only misfires when &quot;it isslightly dirty,&quot; it explodes when sand gets in the barrel.The Soviet Kalashnikov rifle on the other hand, will firewhen &quot;clogged with sand or dirt.&quot; U.S. helicopters break downin desert sandstorms, but &quot;Soviet helicopters keep flying inthose conditions.&quot;   The Soviet military no longer speaks in one voice, and notall of the accounts offered by Soviet military authoritieshave been so bent on self-deception. In fact, DefenseMinister Dmitri Yazov, in reviewing preliminary lessons ofthe war, has spoken of &quot;weak spots&quot; in Soviet air defenses.&quot;What happened in Kuwait and Iraq necessitates a review ofthe attitude to . . . the country's entire air defensesystem,&quot; he told the Soviet parliament on Feb. 28. Gen.Vladimir Lobov, head of the now defunct Warsaw Pact forces,is also alarmed. The Gulf War is giving the Americans achance to test their weaponry and change their technology, aprocess that will help in &quot;perfecting&quot; U.S. and NATO forces.This will in turn lead to a &quot;violation of parity between thetwo systems . . .&quot;   Press analyses have explained the technological threat inoperational terms. Krasnaya Zvezda on Jan. 25 told Sovietreaders that the American forces are &quot;saturated&quot; with thelatest combat gear. &quot;This applies primarily to electronicwarfare&quot; as well as to precision guided munitions that arethe &quot;latest achievement of science and technology-laser,electronic and so forth.&quot; Such weapons allow for &quot;exceptionalaccuracy of target destruction.&quot; Pravda has expressed worrythat reports of the Tomahawk cruise missile's effectivenesswill &quot;divert Western politicians from understanding the needto block this dangerous channel of the arms race.&quot;   The Patriot missile has been treated with great respect.&quot;Highly accurate,&quot; &quot;very effective,&quot; &quot;modern,&quot; &quot;crammed withJapanese electronics&quot; are the words with which honest Sovietmilitary experts have appraised the Patriot air defensesystem. And the anti-missile missile is Moscow's major newconcern. Izvestia says it is an SDI kitten that has not yetturned into a full grown tiger. Pravda says that thePatriot's success has generated &quot;technophoria&quot; in Washington,a sentiment that is being translated into renewed support forSDI. The Bush administration, says the newspaper, has seizedon the effectiveness of the missile to lobby &quot;in everypossible way&quot; for SDI's reactivation.   Soviet military leaders recognize that the Soviet Union'spathetic economy will not be rescued soon. Students of theSoviet economy all agree; the worst is yet to come. In thearea of electronics and computers in particular, the SovietUnion is destined to fall generations behind. Until theanarchic planned economy is completely overhauled, competingin technology with the U.S. is not an option.   Arms control was once the most promising vehicle torestrain the West in areas where competition looked like alosing bet. But even if the West were willing, the pace ofWestern technological change is not something that can be putup for discussion at a bargaining table. The Soviet Union canonly win a hand or two at the arms control game -- U.S.satellites show that when it comes to military technology itholds perpetually bad cards.   The Kremlin may be forced to take cues from the limitedareas where the Iraqis did well. The elusive Scud launchersshow that mobile missiles &quot;are relatively safe from airstrikes,&quot; says Col. Valery Ochirov, a member of the SupremeSoviet committee for Defense and Security Questions. We canexpect that Moscow will want to further develop, not tradeaway, its truck and rail-launched ballistic missiles.   The Iraqis also did well with &quot;maskirovka.&quot; &quot;Operativecamouflage, including the extensive use of various mockupsand fake airfields and launching positions was well thoughtout and effectively implemented,&quot; says Lieut. Gen. ValentinPereverzev. This suggests a low-cost, low-tech strategy forthe Soviet Union to survive as a formidable military power.Ever since Catherine the Great, Russia has been good atbuilding Potemkin villages. If it can solve the papershortage, Moscow could build an enormous arsenal of tanks,planes and rockets, all made of papier-mache.   ---   Mr. Schoenfeld is a fellow at the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies and editor of Soviet Prospects.</TEXT></DOC>
