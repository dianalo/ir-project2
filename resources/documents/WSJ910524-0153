He was left with a broken neck,paralyzed from the chest down.   Soon after the accident, Mr. Fu, who was 20 years old atthe time, received 563,000 Hong Kong dollars (aboutUS$72,200) in compensation from his employer's insurancecompany. But when the money began to run out, his familyapproached the government with evidence of employernegligence. Last month, a Hong Kong court awarded Mr. FuHK$6.5 million in compensatory damages from his formeremployer, Mannings Retail Ltd., a drugstore-chain subsidiaryof Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd.</LP><TEXT>   The amount, though small by the standards of manyindustrialized countries, is the highest ever awarded to aHong Kong resident for a job-related injury. And localinsurers -- already reeling from a rising number of employeecompensation claims -- fear that the case could serve as aprecedent for others.   And there seems to be reason for worry on the part of theindustry. Insurance executives say privately that several ofthe largest underwriters are losing HK$50 million each fromhigh-maintenance employee compensation claims. By someestimates, the industry's total losses from such claims couldreach HK$500 million by 1992, and that could result in anindustry shakeout.   On the other side, disabled workers and their lawyers saythat this British colony's mandatory employee compensationinsurance plan is inadequate, and that the program's one-timepayments don't cover the accrued costs of long-term care. Asevidence, they point to the increasing numbers of injuredworkers who, after testing the financial limitations ofemployee compensation policies, are turning to the courts toseek additional and often substantial disability awards.   &quot;People are more claim-conscious,&quot; says Alex Wong,chairman of the General Insurance Council of Hong Kong. NickHelms, deputy chairman of the Accident Insurance Associationof Hong Kong, adds that for injured workers, &quot;filingcommon-law claims is now a topper for employee compensationpayments.&quot;   Underwriters are worried. They say small gains by the HongKong Labor Department in reducing work-site safety hazardsamount to little next to the hundreds of millions of dollarsin insurance claims they expect to pay in coming years. &quot;Forpolicies written in 1987 {for example}, we don't know whatthe total losses will be until 1993, when the statute oflimitations expires and all claims are in,&quot; says an executivewith one of Hong Kong's largest insurance underwriters. &quot;Whatwe do know is it will be a lot.&quot;   Since 1984, the government has required employers toprovide workers with compensation insurance to coverjob-related injuries or illness. A policy entitles anemployee to wage reimbursement after the fourth day of sickleave at two-thirds of his or her full salary, taking the ageof the injured worker into account. Permanent injuries aretypically compensated in accordance with a list of&quot;scheduled&quot; disabilities, with a maximum payment ofHK$485,000. Compensation ranges from 10% of the maximum forthe loss of an index finger to 100% for the loss of two ormore limbs. (Mr. Fu's initial compensation comprised themaximum allowed, plus a reimbursement of lost wages.)   Underwriters say that with out-of-court settlements, thesystem works. But for cases that make it to the courts andinvolve claims of employer negligence, graphic descriptionsof injured workers' pain and suffering are influencing courtdecisions much more than in the past. &quot;There has been asignificant change in the levels of awards offered in thecourts,&quot; says Rodney Pritchard, the Hong Kong lawyer whoargued on behalf of Mr. Fu.   Unlike employee compensation claims, which are generallypaid within three months, common-law claims can take years tosettle. Hong Kong law provides a three-year statute oflimitations, allowing a worker injured in 1987, for instance,to wait until 1990 before filing a claim, which in turn cantake several more years of litigation before a judgment isdelivered. &quot;You'd probably think it's easy to get a lossadjuster on every case,&quot; says Mr. Helms. &quot;In fact, largecompanies get thousands of employee compensation claimscoming across their desks every day. Oftentimes there'snothing to alert us to the fact that the claim may extend{long} into the future.&quot;   Insurers say the problem is exacerbated by the hundreds ofemployers who underreport the size and wages of their staffsin order to reduce premium payments. &quot;Employers areunderdeclaring their wages, failing to disclose true businessactivities, and as a result we aren't getting the prices weshould for our services,&quot; says the executive with a majorHong Kong underwriter. Adds Mr. Helms: &quot;What we're gettingare honest employers subsidizing the dishonest ones.&quot;   Employee compensation accounts now represent 16% of thetotal annual premiums collected by Hong Kong underwriters,excluding medical insurance. In 1989, the latest year forwhich figures are available, member firms of the insurancecouncil reported aggregate losses from employee-compensationclaims of HK$50.7 million, compared with profits of HK$22.8million the previous year. Still, officials say that 1989'slosses were actually much greater because many insurersunderreport their results in order not to unnerve clients.   &quot;Gross premiums {the amount collected from clients} aregenerally in line with expectations, but reported lossesappear far too low,&quot; says an executive with one of thecolony's major underwriters. He says 1990 results appear tohave been much worse.   The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance -- thegovernment's industry watchdog -- apparently agrees withindustry worries about a possible shakeout. In a writtenresponse to queries, a spokesman said: &quot;The insuranceindustry in Hong Kong is in a process of restructuring andconsolidation. This could result in further insurers decidingor being required to withdraw from the market as a result ofincreasing capital requirements or by action taken by thisregulatory authority.&quot;   With 254 insurers now operating in Hong Kong, underwriterssay only the weakest underwriters with disproportionateexposure to employee-compensation and motor-vehicle policiesare immediately at risk.</TEXT></DOC>
