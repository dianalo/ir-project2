Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart was quoted Tuesday in thenewspaper, El Nacional, as saying Mexico would maintain its exporttarget of 1.36 million barrels a day until the 13-member cartelreaches agreement on a production cut.   Mexico, the world's sixth largest oil producer, was one ofseveral non-OPEC producers that last week held talks with theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries about reducing outputin a joint effort to bolster sagging world prices.   Hiriart said OPEC had not rejected the proposal, and wouldreconsider it in the coming months.   OPEC wound up several days of meetings Monday in Vienna,Austria, without reaching agreement on the production cutbackproposal.   The cuts were to be made in conjunction with Mexico and fiveother non-OPEC producers, which offered to lower their output by 5percent or about 200,000 barrels a day if OPEC members did the same.   Other non-cartel producers involved in the talks were Egypt,China, Malaysia, Oman and Angola.   While not an OPEC member, Mexico carefully monitors itsdecisions and often follows its lead on pricing and productionpolicies.   The nation's economy is heavily dependent on its oil industry,which is the No. 1 source of foreign revenue needed to service itsforeign debt of about $100 billion, the second highest in thedeveloping world after Brazil.   In an effort to ease the oil dependence, President Miguel de laMadrid has pushed in recent years to expand sales of non-oil goodsto foreign buyers.   A recent report from the National Institute of Statistics saidthe nation earned $1.8 billion in petroleum sales in the firstthree months of this year, compared to $3.5 billion in non-oilexports.   In all of last year, the nation gained $7.9 billion from crudesales, a 41.2 percent increase over 1986 when oil prices plummetedon the world market.   The United States bought nearly 47 percent of Mexico's oilexports last year, followed by Spain with 15.2 percent and Japanwith 13.9 percent, according to Pemex, the state-run oil company.   Last July, the government boosted its export volume to 1.36million barrels a day after maintaining an export target of 1.32million barrels a day in the first half of 1987.   Prior to the 1986 collapse in oil prices, the daily exportplatform had been 1.5 million barrels.</TEXT></DOC>
