The reducing environment brought about by the presenceof hydrocarbons induces reduction and mobilization of iron. This element,essential for plant growth, is assimilated by vegetation in the reduceddivalent state and is found in anomalously high concentrations in pineneedles and sagebrush leaves over the Bell Creek Oil Field, Montana.The reduction of hydrated iron oxides and (or) hematite to form magnetiteis also a consequence of petroleum microseepage. High-wave-number magneticanomalies at Bell Creek are interpreted to reflect increased amountsof diagenetic magnetite in near-surface rocks. Comparison of these preliminarybiogeochemical and aeromagnetic data suggests that changes in transition-elementchemistry in near-surface rocks and soils owing to petroleum microseepagemay be a useful indicator of buried petroleum deposits.</TEXT></DOC>
