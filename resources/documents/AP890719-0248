Gorbachev said today thatthousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urgingrailway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrestthreatens his economic reforms.   Strikes have shut down more than 200 mines and factories in thecountry's two top coal-producing regions, official reports said. Ina report to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev said they have resulted ina 1 million-ton drop in coal production.   Following Gorbachev to the podium, legislator Anatoly Saunin saideach lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise helpimprove living conditions. ``You mustn't hold a knife to thethroat'' of the government, he told strikers.   Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's topcoal region, said the number of striking mines there increased from20 on Tuesday to 58 today.   ``Now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join thestrike as of Aug. 1,'' Gorbachev said during the parliamentarysession, which was broadcast on television and radio.   ``Such a development of events poses a threat to theimplementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika,'' hesaid, referring to his efforts to restructure the economy.   Miners began walking out July 11 in Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin coalregion. Workers in other industries in the region soon followed. OnSaturday, miners in the Donetsk coal basin began walking off the job.   The miners are demanding more local control over their industryas well as higher wages and better living conditions.   Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegramto miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions grantedto Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well.   He blamed some of the miners' discontent on ``anti-socialist''elements but said he understood their basic demands.   Government negotiations with strike committees have resolved mostof the miners' demands, including those on pensions and overtime,but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle,and the miners are refusing any delay, he said.   Central authorities have so far balked at granting miners morecontrol over their industry.   If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy, ``We mayhave to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've beendoing,'' Gorbachev said, without specifying what steps he would take.   He said the lost coal production could not be recovered byincreasing the mines' output because they already work at fullcapacity.   Recent reports have put the total number of strikers in theDonetsk and Kuznetsk regions at more than 112,000, but the numberappeared to be rising.   Because of disrupted coal deliveries, the strike threatened ``acatastrophe'' at metallurgical and electrical power plants, Tasssaid.   The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member ofthe ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in thetractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline.   He held marathon meetings with strikers Monday night and Tuesdayand addressed 30,000 people in the main square of Prokopyevsk, 2,100miles east of Moscow.   Miners in the Donetsk Basin are demanding a 40 percent wageincrease for night work, improved living conditions, a fixed day offand retirement after 20 years of underground work.   They also demand that the Coal Mining Ministry trim itsmanagerial staff.   Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union'sthird major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also was on strike.   A proposed law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts isbeing rushed through the Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said.   A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, ValeryLegachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov ``promised to increase thearea's regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent, as well as soapand washing powder.''   Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported Tuesday thatSlyunkov promised higher pay for night work, longer vacations and adoubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits.   The strikes are believed to be the nation's worst since the1920s, when the country was gripped in revolution, civil war and apower struggle. Records from that period are sketchy, but fightingwas widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted.   Until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the official media did notreport job actions in the Soviet Union. Underground reportsdescribed strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread asthose in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.</TEXT></DOC>
