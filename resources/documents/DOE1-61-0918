The contribution that ground forcescan make to ending war is scenario dependent. Use of forces will dependupon policy objectives. Original policy objectives can be changed afterthe conflict begins. In fact, most military strategic plans are open-ended.War plans cover the first acts more often than they address the conclusion.These difficulties are compounded by the diversity of the internationalsystem today compared to earlier times when it was dominated by majorEuropean powers. Proliferation of sophisticated armaments into developingcountries and terrorist groups has increased the costs of even smallwars. The author addresses the difficulty of using ground forces in wartermination for conventional and counterinsurgency conflicts. Successin counterinsurgency requires an understanding of the special requirementsof that kind of warfare. U.S. experience and traditions are orientedto more conventional conflicts. &quot;Winning&quot; in low intensity conflicts,according to the author is forcing the level of violence back down toa level that can be handled by indigenous, civil authorities. Nor isthe ending likely to be clear cut. U.S. forces must act in tandem withhost country forces in ambiguous circumstances; the measure of successis the diminished need for U.S. assistance as host country forces attainoperational objectives. Ground forces operations under these conditions,if they are to succeed, will be short in duration, of low profile, anddevoid of elaborate logistics.</TEXT></DOC>
