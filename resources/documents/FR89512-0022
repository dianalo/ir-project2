First, to clarify the breadth of payments governed by these regulations.In addition to the benefit payments enumerated in the current text of 31CFR 210.2(d), these regulations apply to nonbenefit payments, includingbut not limited to, vendor payments, Internal Revenue Service tax refunds,savings bonds, grants, and loans. This part, as its title suggests, generallyapplies to all payments which the Federal Government originates throughfinancial institutions by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Method. Second,a section on prenotification is added to establish the framework for thesemessages. Third, provisions are added, expressly applying the ACH Methodof payment to discretionary allotments from Federal employees' wage andsalary payments. Fourth, other minor changes are needed including a paragraphto cover instances of termination of enrollments due to the closing ofa financial institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Sheryl Morrow, Manager, PolicyResearch Branch, Financial Management Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury,Room 328, Liberty Center, 401 14th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20227, (202)287-0308.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On July 27, 1988 (53 FR 28233), Treasurypublished a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (minor corrections were publishedon August 12, 1988 (53 FR 30512), because of typesetting errors) proposinga number of revisions to Part 210 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations,which sets forth the rights and liabilities of the Federal Government,financial institutions, and recipients where recipients of Federal Governmentpayments authorize the payments to be made by the ACH Method. The regulationsin this part were promulgated in 1975 and revised in 1976, 1984, and 1987.A number of new or revised definitions have been added at andSection; 210.2,including definitions of allotment, recipient, allotter, discretionaryallotment, employee, and nonbenefit payment. The definition of ``Payment''has been expanded to include nonbenefit payments. The definition of ``Paymentinstruction'' has been modified to change the phrase ``similar writing''to read ``similar record'' to describe more accurately the media on whichpayment instructions may be contained. Finally, the definition of ``Recipient''has been expanded to mean a person, corporation, or other public or privateentity which is authorized by a program agency to receive benefit or nonbenefitpayments from the Federal Government. ``Recipient'' includes a naturalperson or entity authorized by a program agency to receive benefit paymentsfor a beneficiary. A new paragraph designated andSection; 210.4(c)(5) has been added to coverinstances of termination of enrollments due, to the closing of a financialinstitution without successor. Changes have been made to andSection; 210.6(e) to reflect that the FederalReserve Bank will now be required to make the amount specified in a nonbenefitpayment available for withdrawal from a financial institution's books onthe payment date, rather than the opening of business on the payment date.This is consistent with current usage in the commercial world and otherTreasury programs such as <T3>Treasury Direct. </T3>Treasury has always required that benefit andsalary payments be available to the recipient at the opening of businesson the payment date, and will continue with this policy for these paymentsonly. A parallel change has been made to andSection; 210.7(d) which requires afinancial institution to make the amount specified in a nonbenefit paymentinstruction available on the payment date.Section 210.8 has been added to establish the framework for sending prenotificationmessages to financial institutions prior to the first payment. Before aninitial payment is to occur, the Government may send the financial institutiona prenotification message to alert it that an ACH payment has been authorized.For consistency with other areas of this regulation, the phrase in andSection;210.8(d) ``post the payment'' has been changed to read ``make the paymentavailable.'' Prenotification requires verification by the financial institutionof the accuracy of the account information. When prenotifications are used,information relating to the ACH payment, except the amount, will be providedso that the information can be verified by the financial institution. Commenters suggested that prenotifications be required for all GovernmentACH payments. Operational constraints, within the Financial ManagementService and Federal program agencies, preclude making prenotificationsmandatory. This regulation now will permit the use of prenotificationsand will require the appropriate responses to them from financial institutions,while retaining the ability to expand the use of prenotification as theService and agency operational systems are modified to permit using prenotifications.Policy determinations regarding the use of prenotification may be madefrom time to time by the Service. Prenotification procedures will be issuedby the Service. A new Subpart C has been added to establish the framework by which FederalGovernment employees may make discretionary allotment payments directlyfrom their wage and salary payments by ACH to a third party account. Changes to policies and operating procedures may be issued by the FinancialManagement Service as needed in The Green Book on Direct Deposit or othercommunications. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>Sec. 210.2_Definitions The proposed regulations defined ``business day'' as any day on which theFederal Reserve Bank of the district is open to the public. The majority of the commenters stated that ``business day'' and ``bankingday'' should be defined as ``any day on which the financial institutionis open for business.'' To respond to the comments, the ``banking day''and ``business day'' definitions have been changed to conform to the FederalReserve Board's definitions under Regulation CC (53 FR 19434). The proposed rule defined ``financial institution'' to mean ``bank, savingsbank, savings and loan association, credit union, or similar institution.Where a financial institution utilizes the services of a correspondentbank, the term financial institution shall include a designated correspondent.''The majority of the commenters objected to including the term ``correspondentbank'' due to inherent risks and responsibilities of the receiving depositoryinstitution. The reference to a correspondent bank has been deleted fromthe definition. The ``nonbenefit payment'' definition has been expanded to include othertypes of Government payments that may be made by the ACH Method. Commenters raised concern about the language of andSection; 210.7: financialinstitutions shall make the amount of a recurring benefit or Federal salarypayment ``. . .  available for withdrawal or other use by the recipientby the opening of business on the payment date.'' Several commenters statedthat under the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation CC the payment does nothave to be available until the next day after receipt. Regulation CC statesthat it does not override Treasury regulations or ACH association rulesthat require prompter availability. A new andSection; 210.8 is included to establish a framework for sendingprenotification messages to financial institutions prior to receipt ofpayment to be used at the option of the Financial Management Service (abureau of the United States Department of the Treasury). Commenters suggestedthat prenotification be required for all Government ACH payments. Operationalconstraints, both within the Financial Management Service and Federal programagencies, preclude making prenotification a requirement. This regulationwill now permit the use of prenotifications and require the appropriateresponse to them from financial institutions. Some comments expressed concern over the liability of financial institutionsregarding verification of enrollments. No changes were made to andSection;210.11(b) as the regulations provide that financial institutions are notliable when the initial enrollment was not made by the financial institution.Subpart C_Discretionary allotments. One commenter was of the opinion that discretionary allotments were mandatory.Discretionary allotments are not mandatory and may be made for any purposethat is approved by the agency head consistent with existing regulations(210.17(a)). The proposed language on collection and reclamation of discretionary allotmentpayments (210.18(c)) has been deleted. Federal salary discretionary allotments,like all nonbenefit payments, are not subject to reclamation. Treasury has determined that this is not a major rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.It is hereby certified pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act thatthis revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act analysisis not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 210 </ITAG>Automated Clearing House, banks, banking, electronic funds transfer, FederalReserve System.
