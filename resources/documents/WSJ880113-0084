When meetings are winding down, one software developer sometimes steps into the hall and tells his driver to be ready to pick him up.    --Take it to the club. Jonathan Kaye, a Boston real estate developer, sometimes takes a portable to his health club to avoid missing important calls. Some golfers slip them in their bags.    --Avoid the rush.

In restaurants it gets a chair of its own at the table,&quot; says Carol Broadbent, a Sun Microsystems Inc. manager who recently returned from the Far East.
