The survey was part of a NIOSH study of the health effectsof occupational exposure to wood preservatives. Approximately 69 of theemployees at the facility were assigned to the wood production and treatingprocess areas that were surveyed. The facility maintained an industrialhygiene and safety program. Medical services were provided by an on callphysician, a full time facility nurse, and employees trained in firstaid. Average PCP concentrations over the full shift ranged from 10.1to about 25 micrograms per cubic meter, below the current occupationallimit of 500 micrograms per cubic meter. Creosote air concentrationsranged from 0.045 to 0.352 micrograms per cubic meter, also below theOSHA standard of 0.2 milligrams per cubic meter. The author concludesthat while exposures were below environmental criteria, they could befurther reduced by shorting the work operations at the Cellon process.He also recommends minimizing skin contact and absorption from contaminatedclothing.</TEXT></DOC>
