However, it is much less clear that itwill ever be possible to make the general statement that, for any EORapplication, it will always be possible to find surfactants which functioncosolvent-free. As a practical consideration, cosolvents may still commonlybe found in EOR applications. Secondary butanol has been the most commonchoice for a cosolvent. Primarily because of its near equi-partitioningbetween water and oil. Therefore it has little effect on optimum salinities.One serious deficiency of secondary butanol is that it is not very surfaceactive and is therefore relatively inefficient at the oil water interface.The object of this study is to identify low molecular weight amphiphileswhich would function similarly to secondary butanol but be of enhancedsurface activity. The species that the authors had investigated are oxo-alcoholswith appropriate ethylene oxide content as well as cresols, also withthe appropriate ethylene oxide content.</TEXT></DOC>
