Ministers from the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries were expected to meet again Saturday in Vienna, Austria,to ratify a proposed six-month oil reduction accord.   But analysts remained skeptical over just how long the deal wouldlast or how much impact it would have on prices.   ``In reality, we'll see whatever potential gains are going tocome from this accord on Monday,'' said William Byers, an analystwith Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. ``The market will level off after Monday.''   On the International Petroleum Exchange in London Friday, pricesfor January delivery of Brent, the benchmark North Sea crude oil,climbed $1.65 a barrel to $14.42.   U.S. petroleum exchanges closed early Wednesday for a four-dayThanksgiving holiday, but analysts said U.S. markets would match theEuropean gains if the OPEC ministers signed a final accord over theweekend.   Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closedslightly higher on Wednesday in anticipation that OPEC would reachsome sort of agreement. The contract for January delivery of WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed 11cents higher at $13.97 a barrel after sharp swings during thetrading session.   Prices had convulsed upward since Monday when OPEC convened itswinter meeting in Vienna. Analysts said the highly erratic tradingsessions reflected the dramatic twists and turns emanating from theconference of ministers.   Late Thursday, the ministers announced a tentative pact to reduceoutput from the more than 22 million barrels a day estimated now to18.5 million barrels. The meeting was recessed until Saturday nightto allow Iran's oil minister to return home to consult with hisgovernment.   One of the key provisions of the pact would grant Iraq productionparity with Iran, something Iran had fought bitterly. However, theproposal also reportedly would allow Iran to increase its productionand maintain its 14 percent share of OPEC production.   Analysts said they expect an agreement to bolster prices in theshort term, but said they doubted the accord would last long enoughto boost prices to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel.   Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil Inc., saidhe expected a short-term strengthening of prices if a deal is signed.   ``But once the market fundamentals hit, prices will go down,'' hesaid.   Steve H. Hanke, chief economist of Friedberg Commodity ManagementInc. in Toronto and a professor of economics at Johns HopkinsUniversity, said a combination of excess capacity, a desperate needby OPEC countries for oil export revenue and prices that still farexceed production costs would drive prices down in both the shortand long term.</TEXT></DOC>
