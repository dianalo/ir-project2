(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OFFICEVISION IS the first software implementation of IBM's SystemsApplication Architecture (SAA).andP;  It is the beginning Of IBM's migration fromtraditional, terminal-based, mainframe computing to cooperative processing,object orientation, and distributed network computing (DNC) that willencompassandM;all of IBM's operating system environments.andP;  Because of the depth of therequirements and the effort involved, it will take as long as 10 years forIBM to fully implement this strategy.andM;When IBM completes OfficeVision, a user will be able to find in any SAAsystem the same office software, the same administration, the same databaseenvironment, and a common user interface.andP;  OfficeVision is the implementationof the single-system view across all of SAA.andP;  Any user can simply &quot;walk upand work&quot; regardless of platform and operating system.andM;To implement this ambitious goal, IBM is putting office at the core.andP;  Ratherthan developing an office product as a self-contained applica environment,IBM is positioning OfficeVision as a suite of underlying support utilitiesenhancing strategic business applica.andP;  It will come complete with more than500 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that will help ensure itssuccess.andM;It was obvious to IBM and its customers that, in order to compete in the1990s, IBM would have to implement SAA.andP;  But the mammoth task required tochange traditional batch environments to match the new technology of OS/2will take time.andP;  IBM's programmers need to time to restructure operatingsystems and retrofit new technology on top of old platforms.andP;  The size of thetask gives IBM's traditional customer base the time it needs to slowlymigrate to the next generation.andP;  Already IBM's programmers have written twomillion lines of new code and million lines of existing code.andM;From an architectural perspective, the goal of OfficeVision is to provide theuser with a consistent environment in which the front end does notnecessarily know what it's connected to.andP;  Over time, IBM intends to provideequivalent functionality on all host/server environments--as dictated bySAA--including LU6.2, mail, directory services, calendar, decision support,etc.andP;  Part of the goal is to have all of the platforms use the same codebase.andP;  This is especially critical for IBM if it is to compete in a worldwhere the advent of scalable RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computers) technology means that software only has to be written once to run on smalland large platforms.andM;For IBM, scalability is a long way off.andP;  In the interim, IBM is implementingsoftware code that masks the differences among different platforms.andP;  forms.andO;This means that users can maintain their existing applications while gainingthe benefits of IBM's next-generation software environment.andP;  It also givesIBM programmers some breathing room as they madly code the next generation ofsoftware.andP;  Foundation Technology It is critical for IBM to position itsfoundation technology for its next generation of software now.andP;  Achieving thecompany's goal of true cooperative processing and object-orientedapplications that exist in a distributed network computing environment willbe a complex task.andP;  Ever since IBM declared its SAA strategy, the company hasbeen hard at work reinventing its software environment.andP;  It has discoveredthe difficulty of moving traditional batch environments into the nextgeneration.andM;The difficulty lies in the complexity of implementing all dimensions of thecooperative processing model when the world is filled with systems based onthe old hierarchical model.andP;  To understand where IBM needs to get to in thecoming decade, it is important to start with a look at how cooperativeprocessing can be implemented.andP;  There are three models for cooperativeprocessing: display, function, and data.andP;  Each can be implemented on its own,but, to achieve true DNC, all three models must be combined.andP;  Vendors arealready beginning to implement DNC with either the display or function model.andO;In the end, they afl are intending to reach the data model.andM;The three approaches to cooperative processing include: DISPLAY.andP;  Thedistributed display model means that parts of code from various servers arerun in a shared display mode, exemplified in X-Window.andP;  This is where DigitalEquipment has started to implement cooperative processing.andP;  In DECwindows,part of the display code resides in the workstation, while die applicationscode resides in the host or servers.andP;  IBM's Presentation Manager (PM) doesnot have a way to distribute the display.andP;  FUNCTION.andP;  Distributed function isthe ability to distribute application code across platforms.andP;  Typically, thismeans that a group of functions is placed on the front-end workstation, andmost core functions reside on the larger host platform.andP;  Therefore, inOfficeVision, a portion of the application code resides on OS/2 ExtendedEdition (OS/2EE) and the front-end workstation.andP;  Database and mail servicesreside on the host.andP;  DATA.andP;  The goal of distributed network computing andcooperative processing is to have data and applications distributed across aheterogeneous network.andP;  This is much more difficult to achieve because of thedata management requirement.andP;  (If different parts of the data reside on 10different platforms, how do you know which part belongs where? How do youmanage the application? How do you ensure data integrity?) In the long term,this will be the required paradigm for some types of distributed computing.andO;(Not all P&quot; of distributed processing are appropriate in every situation.andO;However, to have a complete and flexible offering that meets the needs of alltypes of users, vendors need to provide all types of distributed networkcomputing.) Both IBM and Digital intend to implement data cooperativeprocessing.andM;IBM will have to redesign Presentation Manager to allow it to take advantageof the X-Window type of distributed processing.andP;  Digital will add thefunctional cleaving to its X-Window implementation.andP;  Both companies will haveto make dramatic changes to dissect host software and applications to allowthem to reside on different servers across die network.andM;Initially, IBM is cleaving applications between the front-end PS/2 withapplication code by providing the OfficeVision software running under OS/2EE.andO;Therefore, die OS/2EE platform is the strategic code base, and the PS/2 isthe front-end workstation for OfficeVision.andP;  It is here that IBM willimplement new office functionality before porting it to other platforms.andP;  Byproviding a series of APIs that allow the front end to talk to the back endand using some existing gateway and emulation services, IBM can begin to moveto cooperative processing.andP;  This methodology allows IBM to leave most of itsmainframe code in place---at least for now.andP;  Therefore, a user could use thefront-end services of OfficeVision/2 for personal processing, such asmaintaining a personal calendar, composing messages, and writing.andP;  The userwould still go to the host to send mail and to query corporate databases.andO;With this configuration, IBM can leave PROFS (Professional Office System)alone and still allow users to move to OfficeVision.andP;  DISTRIBUTED DATABASE.andO;The strategic database underlying SAA is the Data Manager, a subset of DB2.andO;Although MVS has a full implementation of DB2 and OS/2EE has a subset, itwill take time before the other SAA operating systems have DB2.andP;  (VM stilluses SQL/DS as its strategic database, and the AS/400 has its underlyingOS/400 database.) In the interim, IBM will use another layer of software tomask the differences among database environments.andP;  To allow operating systemswithout DB2 to participate, IBM is using its SQL Server to provide a serviceon top of the database.andP;  Over time, all operating systems and all hardwareplatforms will have DB2 as their underlying database.andP;  DISTRIBUTED DIRECTORYSERVICES.andP;  Distributed directory services (DDS) across an enterprise-widenetwork is key for office computing.andP;  Once a system has DDS, sendinginformation across a heterogeneous network is simple.andP;  Managing andmaintaining a corporate-wide directory is also much easier.andP;  This underlyingdatabase begins to fill a central role in establishing relationships amongsuch core software as electronic mail, calendar, and project management.andP;  Italso sets the foundation for allowing intelligent agents to set up workflowin the network.andM;DDS needs to be a high priority for IBM.andP;  The company has not yet been ableto develop a distributed directory, in part, because of the fragmentedunderlying database described above.andP;  IBM is providing a layer of gluesoftware for directory services as an interim solution, known as the AddressBook in OfficeVision.andP;  At first glance, one might assume that IBM is simplycalling Directory Services the Address Book.andP;  But there is a subtledifference.andP;  The address book, though based on the Data Manager, is not thestrategic SAA DDS.andP;  It will go away when IBM has X.500 distributed directoryservices and DB2 across platforms.andP;  COMMUNICATIONS.andP;  The implementation oftransparent peer-to-peer communications within SAA will not be realized forsome time.andP;  The initial releases of OfficeVision rely on gateways andemulation to give the illusion of transparency.andP;  Where available, DIA(Document Interchange Architecture) is used for document interchange betweenplatforms.andP;  For example, MVS systems use DIA to talk to DISOSS, and theOS/400 uses DIA via OS/400 mail.andP;  VM uses a private protocol since it lacks aDIA implementation.andP;  The VM agent talks to the VM gateway.andP;  Even Release 2 ofOfficeVision uses a 3270 LU2 connection to download mail from the host to thePS/2.andP;  The one exception is IBM's newest operating system, the OS/400, whichhas implemented Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) andpeer-to-peer communications via the LU6.2 protocol.andP;  This allows for atransparent direct attach between the OS/2 workstation and the AS/400 host.andO;From a communications perspective, die AS/400 is a model for OfficeVision.andM;In the long run, the SAA communications model will require LU6.2 as thepeer-to-peer communications transport between environments.andP;  In addition, SAAwill implement TCP/ E? (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protol), aprotocol stack designed to enable interconnectivity between heterogeneousplatforms.andP;  TCP/IP has already shipped for VM, and, last month, was madeavailable on the AS/400.andP;  In the future, it will be made available on MVS andOS/2.andP;  THE ROLE OF CPI-C.andP;  What is perhaps the most important protocol fromthe perspective of scalable software model and for cooperative processing isCPI-C (Common Programming Interface-Communications).andP;  CPI-C allows for truecooperative processing between disparate environments without resorting todifferent protocols in different environments and relying on slow andineffective terminal emulation.andP;  In essence, CPI-C is a more generalizedimplementation of a consistent application to application communicationsprotocol.andP;  Current implementations of APPC are different on each SAAplatform.andP;  Also, there is no API for APPC; a programmer must write directlyto the protocol rather than to an API.andP;  While CPI-C will be a vastimprovement, it is not without difficulties.andP;  CPI-C is a complex, low-levelprotocol that will cause programmers to turn prematurely gray.andP;  For CPI-C tobecome the widely used transparent protocol for SAA, IBM needs a higher levelinterface that is easier to deal with.andP;  This might be a task for athird-party software partner.andP;  LIBRARY SERVICES.andP;  One of the key frontiers ofoffice is allowing users to easily access the myriad of documents andinformation stored in computer systems.andP;  Library services promise such fastand easy access.andP;  IBM is approaching information access by developing thefile cabinet/folder paradigm for individuals and groups, which allows usersto search by author, title, and creation date, and to input several keywords.andP;  But IBM still has work to do.andP;  Its current implementation of filecabinets is limited.andP;  There, is no folder support now, and it is difficultfor users on different systems to find stored information.andM;IBM's intent is to have all library services based on DIA.andP;  Therefore, itplans to do away with reliance on DISOSS in the near future.andP;  In fact, IBMhas made a statement of direction that DISOSS will disappear.andP;  The AS/400already includes the strategic DIA library, and, eventually, the SAA hostenvironments will, also.andM;SearchVision/2, a full-text search and retrieval product intended to work inconjunction with the DIA library services is based on IBM's longstandingmainframe STAIRS product for large-volume data search and retrieval.andP;  IBM istaking the structure of STAIRS and rewritten it in C for OS/2EE.andP;  WhileSTAIRS was based on a hierarchical database, SearchVision/2 will have theData Manager.andP;  It extends scope-of-search terms to full textual content ofdocuments including word, combination of words, partial words, synonyms, andlinguistic inflections.andP;  It can also combine parametric and contextualsearches in single query.andM;Eventually, SearchVision will be available on all SAA platforms.andP;  In themeantime, IBM still has an incompatible library search product for theAS/400.andP;  Needless to say, it will take time to straighten out this confusion.andO;OfficeVision APIs: Integration with Third-Party Applications IBM will beunveiling 500 different APIs over the coming year that will be thecornerstone of the OfficeVision strategy.andP;  These APIs serve a wide variety offunctions, but the overall rationale is to allow third-party applications tobe tightly integrated into the OfficeVision environment.andP;  For IBM's strategicoffice platform to be successful, its APIs will have to be widely used.andM;IBM will make five categories of APIs available: *  Object Services, whichallow for object management withinandM;OfficeVision.andP;  Through these APIS, an object is made knownandM;to the desktop or is registered.andP;  A new application could beandM;added to the desktop through this set of APIS.andP;  One API in thisandM;group will allow a new object to be created and will identifyandM;the properties of that object to the rest of the system.andM;While we think this is the right approach, we'd like to seeandM;IBM align its object management approach with that of theandM;Object Management Group.andP;  The industry as a whole will beandM;well served by consistency in the way objects are managedandM;across heterogeneous networks.andP;  *  Display Services, which are APIs thatallow the application toandM;interact with the screen.andP;  They include the ability to directlyandM;manipulate objects as defined in the Workplace Extensions ofandM;OfficeVision/2.andP;  Certain APIs in this category also allow forandM;use of such functions as pull-down menus, action bars, andandM;scrollable lists---to name a few.andP;  These APIs should makeandM;designing PM applications easier.andP;  For example, PM has asandM;many as 200 different calls necessary to implement a scrollableandM;list.andP;  Through Display Services, they will be rolled into aandM;single API and thus a single call.andP;  *  Communications Services, which areAPIs that will be a layerandM;on top of APPC and are called Application Request HandlersandM;(ARHs).andP;  These APIs are used in Releases 1 and 2 of Of -  fice Vision tocommunicate between the front end and the host.andP;  * Command Services, whichare a set of high-level calls intendedandM;for operation by end users.andP;  They can be used to send anandM;object or to resolve a nickname, and to create an executableandM;series of commands, such as sending the results of a search toandM;a distribution list.andP;  *  System Services, which are intended to make iteasier toandM;integrate an application within OfficeVision.andP;  Therefore, theyandM;would allow a property management application, for example,andM;to take advantage of electronicandM;mail, to look theandM;same and follow the sameandM;task management conven -  tions as OfficeVision.andP;  Environment NetworkManagement If a user already has a 370 environment, then IBM has a good storyto tell about network management, since NetView, IBM's strategic networkmanagement product, requires a 370 host.andP;  However, there is no networkmanagement software that could manage a 10-LAN network.andP;  Each LAN would haveto be managed independently.andP;  The same can be said for the user thatimplements the AS/ 400 and several LANs.andP;  This is a weakness in IBM'sstrategy.andP;  Operating Systems Evolution DUAL STRATEGY.andP;  IBM has a dualoperating system strategy: SAA and AIX, IBM's Unix.andP;  SAA represents IBM'straditional proprietary operating systems; AIX is its industry-standardoffering.andP;  AIX.andP;  IBM has spent the last three years putting the pieces of itsSAA strategy together and convincing the world that it makes sense.andP;  Thecompany now has the task of putting Unix, the other pillar of its long-termstrategy, into perspective.andP;  Over the past year, IBM has begun to unveilplans to give equal billing to AIX and SAA.andP;  While most of IBM's own officestrategic software in the coming year will be implemented under SAA, AIX willincreasingly become an important applications base.andP;  An indication of this isthe fact that, next year, IBM will release a subset of DB2 for AIX.andP;  Thiswill add vital connectivity and interoperability between platforms.andP;  AlthoughIBM will not merge SAA and AIX, it will provide as much connectivity andinteroperability as possible.andP;  (Note that IBM has begun to port the popularTCP/IP protocols from Unix to SAA).andP;  IBM has not yet announced its strategicUnix office product, but we expect that it will provide connectivity toOfficeVision.andP;  SAA OPERATING SYSTEMS.andP;  IBM has settled on four strategicoperating systems: VM, MVS, OS/400, and OS/2EE.andP;  Each of the operatingsystems is evolving to have a distinct role in IBM's proprietary strategy.andO;Each will follow a different route and a different timetable for implementingOfficeVision because of the disparity in design.andP;  ROLE OF DOS.andP;  While IBM'sprimary concentration is on OS/2EE, IBM's customers forced it to at least putup with DOS.andP;  So, much against its will, IBM developed what it calls the DOSRequester.andP;  DOS has a  very limited role: It can primarily send and receivemail.andP;  On the LAN, a DOS Requester can communicate with hosts via NETBIOS toAPPC.andP;  In Release 2 of OfficeVision, DOS Requesters can communicate directlywith the various host environments.andP;  Not only is DOS's role limited, but theuser interface is unsophisticated.andP;  IBM decided to create an imitation of agraphical interface for an 8086 PC.andP;  It purposely did not use MS Windows as astarting point.andP;  The fear was that if a DOS product was too graphical and toofunctional, no one would be motivated to move to OS/2 and the PS/2 hardware.andO;It proved to be a genuine concern.andP;  IBM will have to continue to grapple withit because users are complaining loudly.andP;  ROLE OF OS/2 STANDARD EDITION VS.andO;EXTENDED EDITION.andP;  To get the goodies of OfficeVision requires ExtendedEdition.andP;  There is no role for a PC running OS/2 Standard Edition (OS/2SE).andO;If developers do not gravitate en masse to Extended Edition, IBM runs therisk of having OS/2EE perceived as a proprietary operating system.andP;  Anotherissue is that OS/2SE has not captured the imaginations of developers orusers.andP;  Both IBM and Microsoft are struggling to find a way to bring this newoperating system into the mainstream.andP;  RAMIFICATIONS OF THE ROLE OF DOS ANDOS/2SE.andP;  Because of the minor role for both these operating systems, usersthat have DOS PCs and non-IBM 386 platformslike Compaqare left out in thecold.andP;  Sure, a Compaq 386 machine can be a DOS Requester, but it is notfunctional enough to warrant the expense.andP;  There is absolutely no room forthe Macintosh in IBM's OfficeVision environment, either.andP;  These are issuesthat IBM's customers are likely to bring up in the near future.andP;  Today, wedon't think IBM has a good answer.andP;  MAKING BATCH APPEAR INTERACTIVE.andP;  One ofthe most difficult tasks for IBM is to radically alter the nature of itstraditional mainframe operating systems so they can participate in theobject-oriented, DNC environment.andP;  This will be done by rewriting criticalpieces of operating system code, called &quot;hot pools,&quot; for both VM and MVS.andO;The concept of hot pools is intended to help keep these older operatingsystems alive to perform functions that their designers never dreamed of.andM;However, in the meantime, IBM is again using &quot;glue software code&quot;---theApplication Request Handler (ARH)-to bridge the gap.andP;  ARH is a layer of codeabove the operating system that fools the batch operating system intothinking that it is interactive.andP;  In essence, as mentioned earlier, the ARHis an API on top of APPC for OS/2EE.andP;  It creates a simulation of threadsbetween the front end and the back-end host so that multiple requests can beprocessed simultaneously.andP;  OfficeVision/2 LAN OfficeVision/2 LAN is the mostimportant component of OfficeVision-and the most pragmatic.andP;  IBM has beenlistening and is aware of the potential to take advantage of the growingacceptance of LANs in the office.andP;  Therefore, it has chosen to make the LANthe centerpiece of its move into the next generation of office technology.andM;While it is not officially announced, we understand that third-party LANvendors plan to provide OS/2 servers for OfficeVision for their LANS.andO;Therefore, in time, users might be able to run OfficeVision on 3Com, Novell,or Banyan LANS.andP;  Perhaps Ethernet support will be added.andM;In the interim, IBM has announced that it will provide NETBIOS-based softwarefrom Consumer Software, Incorporated, called Network Courier, which allowsfor mail exchange between OfficeVision and other DOS LANS.andP;  These directionsgive IBM a strong future position in the LAN market.andP;  IBM seems convincedthat LANs are the key to the future.andP;  More and more, the company is hearingfrom its customers that they want to be able to increase the size of theirLANS.andP;  At the same time, they are requiring all the robust management anddiagnostics available in a traditional minicomputer.andM;IBM has thought through a lot of the basic needs of LAN users.andP;  For example,it is allowing software to be downloaded from the LAN server to eachindividual PC.andP;  It is also bundling support in with the LAN software price.andO;IBM will be offering an 800-telephone support line.andP;  In addition, at leastfor now, users will be given software release upgrades of the LAN at noadditional charge.andP;  IBM also understands that the computer store and dealerare an untapped potential distribution channel for LANs.andP;  Therefore, itintends to distribute its LAN through stores.andP;  But before this is successful,IBM will have to provide a lot of training---an issue IBM's marketers seem toacknowledge.andP;  It will be worth the effort.andP;  A sophisticated retailer can be avaluable marketing partner.andP;  OFFICEVISION/2 LAN RELEASE 1.andP;  Office/Vision/2LAN Release 1, with a scheduled release date of September 1989, is what we'dcall a &quot;stake-in-the-ground&quot; product.andP;  In other words, there is limitedfunctionality, but at least it will be delivered.andP;  The product includes thefollowing components: * Mail * Correspondence processor * Address Book *Telephony support * Filing system * Linguistic aids * OS/2EE workplaceextensions user interface * DOS Requester MAIL.andP;  LAN mail serves twopurposes: It provides basic electronic messaging capability within a LANenvironment and a front end into mail on hosts including MVS, VM, and OS/400.andO;Therefore, the PROFS user who wants to move to a graphical user interface formail can use a PS/2 front end.andP;  In Version 1, that user would have to beconnected to a LAN.andP;  In Release 2, the user could connect the PS/2 runningOS/2EE and the OfficeVision software directly to the host.andP;  CORRESPONDENCEPROCESSOR.andP;  In Release 1, IBM is providing very minimal word processing--thecorrespondence processor is simply DisplayWrite Assistant.andP;  Users would beexpected to use the correspondence processor to create mail messages or shortletters and still use other word processors for the bulk of their writing.andO;However, like the Release I product as a whole, the correspondence processoris only a placeholder.andP;  The real stuff starts showing up in Release 2.andO;LINGUISTIC AIDS.andP;  Linguistic aids include capabilities such as grammar- andspell-checkers.andP;  IBM is making available some of the grammar-critiquingsoftware out of its laboratories.andP;  ADDRESS BOOK.andP;  IBM uses the term &quot;AddressBook&quot; for the name-and-address file that uses the services of the various IBMrelational databases which, in turn, are tied to distributed directoryservices.andP;  In Release 1, the Address Book is restricted to the individualLAN.andP;  TELEPHONY SUPPORT.andP;  Telephony support allows a user to auto-dial anumber by clicking on a name from the Address Book.andP;  It requires theappropriate hardware in the PC.andP;  FILE SYSTEM.andP;  OfficeVision on the LAN takesadvantage of the new High Performance File System (HPFS) that was announcedwith OS/2 Version 1.2.andP;  FILE CABINET.andP;  Datafiles (including mail messages)within OfficeVision can be stored either in drawers in the user's workstationor on the LAN server.andP;  There is not yet support for folders within drawers.andO;USER INTERFACE.andP;  Release I provides the beginning of the new user interface,which IBM is calling Workplace Extensions to Presentation Manager.andP;  Theinterface is an iconic representation of the desktop  known as the OfficeWindow) and includes icons for the mail cabinet, phone, address book,in-basket, outbasket, document (a word processing document), printer, filecabinet, and shredder.andP;  In this first release, users can click on the icon toinvoke an application.andP;  However, they cannot drag an icon to another icon toinvoke an action, nor can they add a new application to the desktop.andP;  Thesecapabilities come in the later release.andP;  There is also no way to tell howmany messages a user has in the in-basket.andP;  There is an audible beep when anew message arrives  but if you've stepped out of the office, you're out ofluck).andP;  WHAT'S MISSING.andP;  Omissions from Release I are die calendar andlibrary services, which don't show up till Release 2.andP;  There is also no wordprocessor.andP;  OFFICEVISION/2 LAN RELEASE 2.andP;  Release 2 of the LAN product is asignificant enhancement over Release I and is the best indication of whereIBM's innovation will be in the future.andP;  Release 2 is also the beginning ofthe evolution of the desktop environment from a static series of icons into anext-generation, object-oriented environment.andP;  Some key additions includecalendaring, document creation, and library services.andP;  * Calendar.andP;  Theinitial implementation of the calendar that wasandM;previewed at announcement was less than stellar.andP;  For example,andM;there is no view of an entire week.andP;  The user is forcedandM;to look at one day at a time.andP;  Also, no scheduler was planned forandM;this release.andP;  We expect that, before the calendar is actually releasedandM;in March 1990, IBM will have made substantialandM;changes.andP;  We were pleased to learn that the calendar is writtenandM;on top of the DB2 subset (the Data Manager).andP;  This has futureandM;implications for IBM's integration of calendar with projectandM;management and electronic mail---if they are all designed onandM;top of the same database.andP;  *  Document Creation.andP;  Although IBM has announcedits strategicandM;compound document/object architecture calledandM;MO:DCA (Mixed Object Document Content Architecture), itandM;has been slow to release the product (compared to Digital,andM;which has already delivered its compound document editor,andM;DECwrite).andP;  Because IBM's full implementation of MO:DCAandM;is not complete, it is putting the first available parts ofandM;MO:DCA into its mail product, calling it a correspondenceandM;processor.andP;  It can import and export RFT:DCA (Revisable TextandM;Format: Document Content Architecture) files with Display -  Write products.andM;The correspondence processor has three components ofandM;MO:DCA: IOCA (Image Object Content Architecture),andM;GOCA (Graphics Object Content Architecture), and PTOCAandM;(Presentation Text Object Content Architecture).andP;  Still missingandM;is RTOCA (Revisable Text Object Content Architecture).andM;IBM's implementation isandM;called a composite editor,andM;not a compound editor.andP;  TheandM;distinction is in how muchandM;flexibility the user has.andP;  In aandM;compound document editionandM;tor, a graphic that is placedandM;within text can be resizedandM;and rotated to a differentandM;position.andP;  In a compositeandM;editor, the graphic can stillandM;be placed into the text, but it appears from border to border andandM;cannot be changed.andP;  Because this correspondence editor hasandM;limited functionality, IBM did the right thing by restricting itandM;to use in mail.andP;  This accomplishes two things: It introduces dieandM;next-generation editor to users, and it allows IBM to introduceandM;a less functional editor without being criticized for the missingandM;pieces.andP;  One nice feature of the correspondence editor is theandM;availability of style sheets to create forms.andM;IBM is promising to make this an &quot;open editor.&quot; An openandM;editor is one that allows third-party developers to write modulesandM;for special purpose functions such as chemical equations.andM;This is a smart move.andP;  * Library.andP;  Library support is based on the DocumentInterchangeandM;Architecture (DIA).andP;  This is the strategic library forandM;SAA, as discussed in &quot;Library Services&quot; above.andM;SearchVision/2, intended to do contextual searches within aandM;library, is a separate product.andP;  SearchVision/2 will only beandM;available on the LAN.andP;  However, IBM will eventually port theandM;product to the other SAA environments.andP;  HELP, PLEASE.andP;  Online help andtutorials have become a hallmark of IBM's new systems (Online help facilitieshave been written as part of OS/2 1.2).andP;  The company realizes that the betterit makes its help facilities, the fewer support calls it will have to handle.andO;Therefore, IBM has developed a new hypertext-like contextual help thateventually will be available throughout SAA.andP;  This help facility isequivalent to 500 pages of documents.andP;  It can also be used by applicationswritten to the OfficeVision APIs.andP;  In addition to the online help, IBM hasincluded integrated tutorials to help train new users.andP;  Considering the factthat IBM is providing a free hot line for the LAN product, it had better havesome good training aids if it expects to be able to manage the support load.andO;MOVING TO OBJECT ORIENTATION.andP;  IBM's goals for user interface are ambitious.andO;Presentation Manager is only a small first step in a grand scheme to providea new generation of object-oriented, graphically based systems.andP;  Release Iprovided a first peck at this direction via the Workplace Extensions.andO;Release 2 goes much further.andP;  While in Release I the desktop wasunchangeable, Release 2 allows for more flexibility.andP;  For example, users canadd their own applications to the desktop.andP;  Third-party packages, such asspreadsheets and word processors, can be added as well.andM;Another important change is the ability to directly manipulate objects on thedesktop.andP;  This is accomplished through a registraton process by which thesystem is informed about the characteristics of the application and thedevices with which it can communicate.andP;  Once registration takes place, adocument can be dragged to the printer or a spreadsheet can be dragged to thereport icon to have it appear as a formatted report.andP;  Another feature allowsa user to directly edit a document stored on the desktop without first havingto call up the editor.andP;  THE ROLE OF DDE.andP;  Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is amessaging protocol for interprogram communication that allows for exchange ofdata between programs.andP;  It first showed up as a protocol under DOS for MSWindows.andP;  However, it has been substantially enhanced for the PM/OS/2EEenvironment, and itandM;is responsible for the desktop environment in OfficeVision.andP;  ItandM;will be a critical component in allowing applications to participateandM;in the full client/server environment, and it is the first stepandM;in implementing object orientation for OfficeVision.andM;When DDE was used in the single-tasking MS WindowsandM;world, it was fairly straightforward.andP;  However, OS/2, with itsandM;multitasking and protected memory, necessitated changes to theandM;protocol.andP;  One problem was that DDE had a two-parameter limit.andM;The first parameter in any DDE message is the handle of theandM;sending window.andP;  Therefore, only a single 32-bit parameter wasandM;left to pass afl other conversation parameters and references toandM;data.andP;  Thus, there was no room for expansion for any changes andandM;additions to the protocol.andP;  The previous version of DDE could notandM;accommodate live links.andP;  While the new version can do live links,andM;IBM has not yet implemented diem in OfficeVision.andP;  The parameterandM;limits also made communications with other LANs andandM;other computers difficult.andM;To expand the space available to change this linking protocol,andM;the PM version of DDE uses the second DDE messageandM;parameter as a 32-bit pointer to one of the two available DDEandM;data structures.andP;  This design allows all parameters to be packagedandM;into a single structure so that the messaging is more consistent.andM;For example, string data is includedandM;in the DDE structure.andM;Because the majority of theandM;DDE messages will be sent orandM;posted to windows in aandM;rate process, the memoryandM;containing the DDE structureandM;has to be made accessible toandM;the receiving window.andP;  This isandM;achieved by providing APIsandM;for sending and posting DDEandM;messages.andP;  Messages and parameters are passed to a system API.andM;This ensures that access to the structures is granted consistentlyandM;and correctly while simplifying the programming efforts of anandM;application implementing DDE.andP;  DDE is especially useful whenandM;establishing communications between clients and servers, suchandM;as electronic mail.andM;Without DDE, applications typically have to resort to usingandM;a clipboard function.andP;  DDE applications can communicate directly,andM;since the DDE format guarantees unique IDs among allandM;applications that use this method to register DDE formats.andM;Another important characteristic of DDE is its use of sharedandM;memory for all communications.andP;  This makes transactions underandM;PM much more transparent.andM;One of the very powerful aspects of DDE in the Of -  ficeVision environmentis its ability to manage conversationsandM;efficiently in the multiclient/multiserver environment.andP;  Therefore,andM;it can facilitate one-to-many as well as many-to-manyandM;conversations.andP;  This will become increasingly critical in theandM;distributed network computing environment that IBM is movingandM;to with OfficeVision.andP;  For example, a user could set up a permanentandM;data link with the server to receive updates as to the state ofandM;an application running on that server.andM;OfficeVision/MVS RELEASE 1.andP;  MVS has had bits and pieces of office in thefrom of different modules including PS/CICS, ASF, and Personal Manager.andP;  Whatalready existed within MVS? First, PS/CICS included mail, library, andaddress book; the Personal Manager Program Option included calendar andtelephone messaging.andP;  One major change is the integration of PS)CICS mail andPersonal Manager so that there is one mailbox for calendar appointmentnotices, telephone messages, and mail.andP;  This is something that existingcustomers have been hounding IBM for.andP;  Other changes existing customers willbe happy about include the ability to use more fast-path commands.andP;  Thesefast path commands can be customized by the user.andP;  Mail now supports adelegate/surrogate facility so that a secretary can schedule appointments forthe boss.andM;OfficeVision/WS brings these pieces together and provides integration ofoffice functions in MVS.andP;  More subtle changes include revisions to MVS officescreens and menus to bring them into line with SAA dictates.andP;  For example, itconforms to CUA (common user interface) requirements in use of PF keys,menus, and the new Help facility.andM;Another important change is the addition of a common menu-driven front endfor CICS, TSO, and IMS tools.andP;  Therefore, a user can move between differentIMS/CICS/TSO applications without having to log on/off from each of theseindependently.andP;  This is important for both a nontechnical user and atechnical user moving between environments.andP;  The result is that a user canhave a single system view of MVS for all three subsystems as well as a singlelogon to VTAM.andP;  Within this environment, IBM is also providing the BusinessApplication Integration Facilities.andP;  This allows up to 32K of parameters tobe passed between IMS/CICS/TSO applications.andP;  APIs will allow users tointegrate their own applications into this environment.andM;This first release for MVS will include the same DOS connection that existedin previous software releases.andP;  It uses the traditional 3270 emulationprotocol.andP;  The DOS Requester feature is available only via the LAN.andP;  TheOS/2EE connection is also available in Release I via the LAN connection.andO;RELEASE 2.andP;  Cooperative processing shows up for MVS in Release 2.andP;  Users willnow be able to connect directly from an OS/2EE workstation to MVS.andP;  The MVSuser can have an iconic front end and add icons representing applications tothe main office window.andP;  The task of navigating among applications is handledby the OS/2EE office feature.andP;  At Release 2, the users have access to theconsistent online Help facility that will be common across all OfficeVisionplatforms.andM;With the Direct Connect feature that is available in Release 2, users coulddownload NWS office mail to the OS/2EE workstation running OfficeVision/2while still using the MVS file cabinet, address book, library services, andhost applications and data.andP;  In addition, the Enterprise Address Book basedon DB2 is implemented for MVS.andP;  As mentioned earlier, all environments willeventually have this same underlying database for the address book.andP;  The MVSEnterprise Address Book is the beginning of the IBM enterprise-widedistributed directory services, since MVS already has DB2.andP;  It includes a setof predefined data fields, the option for the user to add more fields,interactive search on any field, dynamic table definition, and distributionlists and nickname files.andP;  Distribution lists can be personal or shared.andO;OfficeVision/VM PROFS is IBM's largest community of mail users (over 3million PROFS customers and another 200,000 within IBM.andP;  OfficeVision will beimplemented in two stages: first, with a direct connection via the LAN, and,with Release 2, a direct connection via the OS/2EE workstation and the VMenvironment.andP;  Of all the environments, VM will be the slowest to gain the newOfficeVision functionality.andP;  Therefore, users cannot expect a new VM versionof mail, calendar, library, or address book for a few years.andP;  RELEASE 1.andP;  Thechanges to PROFS in Release I are minor and subtle.andP;  First, there is now ashared in-basket and delegate support.andP;  Mail has been improved to reducenetwork traffic.andP;  For example, only one copy of a note is sent for allrecipients at that node/host.andP;  In addition, users can now see who forwardedor who authored a mailed document.andM;The same OS/2EE connections available in MVS (allowing an OS/2 workstation toconnect to the host via the LAN) is available for VM.andP;  Likewise, the DOSRequester feature is available.andP;  The traditional PASF/PC facility has beenenhanced for this release.andP;  This DOS Office Direct Connect provides DOS userswith single-menu access to host and PC applications.andP;  Enhancements include:support of shared in-basket and display of who forwarded messages, ability tocoexist with the DOS applications using the Enhanced Connectivity FacilitiesECF) in limited environments, user modification of fast-path key definitions,full-screen view of messages during logon, and document retrieval by asystem-assigned sequence number.andP;  RELEASE 2.andP;  In Release 2, the user candirectly connect the OS/2EE front end to the VM host.andP;  Just as in Release 2pd OfDISCISION SUPPORT AND EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMSandM;OFFICEVISION HAS a variety of offerings for decisionandM;support.andP;  These include: the existing Application Support (AS) and PC-basedPAS products, Executive Decision, and the Data Interpretation System (DIS).andO;APPLICATION SYSTEM.andP;  First, there is the existing set of products basedaround IBM's Application Support (AS), PC-based Personal Application Support(PAS), and PASF, a version of PAS that interacts with PROFS.andP;  AS includes anSQL table capability, QMF for query management, a project management option,and a procedure language called REXX.andP;  IBM has continued to enhance thisproduct by adding better tools for users to design their own reports andqueries.andP;  It is also the foundation for OfficeVision's reporting and queryfacilities and is iconified in the Office Window.andP;  To automate a series offunctions, IBM still relies on REXX, a long-standing procedure language.andO;While it has some powerful underlying capabilities, it requires the users tolearn a rigid syntax.andP;  We think IBM could come up with a better procedurelanguage.andP;  EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM.andP;  Executive Decision provides its ownunique iconic user interface and allows the executive to view graphicalrepresentations of report information.andP;  It also has hooks into PROFS forservices such as calendar and mail.andP;  While there are some interesting aspectsto the product, such as being able to show a series of charts as a series ofquick slides, there are some problems.andP;  In order to customize information forexecutives, a programmer has to use AS.andP;  This means that executives cannotchange data representations themselves- AS is a programmer's tool.andP;  Each newchart or view of information has to be programmed by an experienced analyst.andO;However, Executive Decision fills an immediate need expressed by customers inthe VM environment who already have a lot of executive-level informationstored on their systems and are looking for a way to present this informationto executives without changing to new hardware.andP;  ANALYTICAL DECISION SUPPORT.andO;The Metaphor Data Interpretation System (DIS) fills another gap for IBM byproviding a system that can take information from various databases and allowanalysts to do complex analysis in a relatively short time.andP;  Until IBMlicensed the product, it required proprietary hardware.andP;  Now, it can run on aPS/2.andP;  However, until there is a 32-bit version of OS/2, it still has aproprietary kernel.andP;  This means that a user running OfficeVision would haveto reboot the workstation before using the Data Interpretation System.andP;  Butit's good technology that users have been asking IBM for.andP;  CONCLUSION.andP;  WhileIBM has a lot of the pieces for a good decision support strategy, they aredisjointed.andP;  A comparison of IBM's amalgamation to the comprehensive set ofofferings that Digital has with its Builder product shows that IBM has aproblem.andP;  The company needs to find a way to bring its AS products togetherwith Metaphor's DIS and its own Executive Support product.andP;  We stronglybelieve that an executive information system will not exist in isolation butwill have the capability that many layers of company management will need.andO;IBM still does not have a good cross-application macro facility that cancompare with HP's NewWave Agent facility.andP;  ficeVision/MVS, the user can usethe graphical OS/2 iconic front end and still use the facilities of theback-end host.andP;  OfriceVision/400 Many of the underpinnings for OfficeVisionhave been part of the AS/400 since its inception.andP;  These are primarilycommunications underpinnings such as LU6.2, APPC, and, more recently, TCP/IP.andO;The AS/400 also has the strategic DIA library.andP;  However, from an officesoftware perspective, only minor enhancements have been made to the originalAS/400 product, which was based on the System/36 office software.andP;  Thechanges that have been made are intended to bring the product in line withCUA (common user access) specifications.andP;  For example, menus have beenreorganized.andP;  Other changes include editing enhancements, the use ofnicknames for electronic mail, and some enhanced calendar functions.andO;PC/Organizer has been changed so that it can be used in conjunction withOS/2EE.andP;  Probably the most important change is the fact that mail is now atrue cooperative function between the PS/2 and the AS/400 host.andP;  AssessmentIBM has pulled a major coup with its OfficeVision announcement True, thenext-generation office functionality will not be delivered for all platformsuntil late 1990 and beyond.andP;  Real cooperative processing will take evenlonger to arrive.andP;  Existing software such as PROFS and the AS/400 office donot get a face lift for several years.andP;  But IBM is providing enough interimadded value to keep customers happy until the whole story unfolds.andM;IBM is on the right path with OfficeVision.andP;  But the acceptance of thisproduct by end users will be a long, hard battle for IBM.andP;  It requires usersto begin to understand that 8NIB on die desktop is acceptable.andP;  It requiresthat they begin to understand the subtleties of moving from the conventionalcomputing environment to DNC and object orientation.andM;But because IBM's mainframe installed base is so intransigent, the companyhas die luxury of time to slowly move these users to the next-generationoffice.andP;  It is a luxury few vendors have.andP;  However, even IBM will have todeliver its promised next-generation office environment over the next yearand a half to keep its installed base happy.andP;  It will have to attract newcustomers to its LAN offerings.andP;  To get new customers and to build its basefor the future, it will have to count on third-party software vendors writingto the office APIs.andP;  If all goes according to plan, OfficeVision will be astandard and a force to be reckoned with.andM;For the user community, IBM's introduction of OfficeVision will begin tochange the perception of what the desktop should look like and whatunderlying capabilities are possible.andP;  It will make the graphical userinterface the de facto standard in the office.andP;  It will take objectorientation - what had been an obscure futuristic concept---and make it live.andO;It will put cooperative processing and distributed network computing in thevocabulary of the user.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
