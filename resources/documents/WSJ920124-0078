The justices now face two such cases: one on theexplosive topic of abortion, the other on corporate taxation.   &quot;It's an extraordinary situation,&quot; observes Mark Evans, aveteran Supreme Court litigator in private practice here. Inat least two areas, the textbook notion of a coherent body offederal law based on compliance with high court rulingsappears to have malfunctioned.</LP><TEXT>   Who is responsible for the confusion? To some degree, thejustices themselves, but perhaps Congress, as well.   Earlier this week, the high court agreed to consider theconstitutionality of Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion law.With a decision expected by July, the case will ensure thatabortion plays a big role in the 1992 presidential campaign.The justices may use the occasion to reassess Roe vs. Wade,the 1973 decision recognizing a constitutional right toabortion. What makes the case remarkable in legal terms isthat a lower court, in effect, already has declared that Roeis no longer the law of the land.   The federal appeals court in Philadelphia last Octoberupheld most of the Pennsylvania law, striking down only arequirement that married women inform their husbands of aplanned abortion. To reach that result, the appeals courtrejected the stringent standard Roe established for judges touse in reviewing the constitutionality of abortionrestrictions. That standard, known as &quot;strict scrutiny,&quot;applies to only a handful of constitutional rights that theSupreme Court has labeled &quot;fundamental.&quot;   In constitutional law, choosing the standard of review ismore than legal doubletalk; it frequently determines theresults of cases. Strict scrutiny requires the government toshow that it has a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in a regulation -- atest that's rarely met.   Claiming that Roe survives in name only, the Philadelphiaappeals court noted that in a series of fragmented abortiondecisions in the 1980s, the increasingly conservative SupremeCourt itself cast doubt on what standard of review ought tobe used. Looking for a &quot;common denominator,&quot; the appealscourt settled on a less-demanding standard urged by JusticeSandra O'Connor. She would generally allow regulations thatdon't place an &quot;undue burden&quot; on women's freedom to chooseabortion.   Rather than insubordination, the lower court demonstratedcandor: The Supreme Court has chipped away so much of Roe'score that nominal preservation of the precedent has becomemisleading. The Pennsylvania case provides an opportunity forclarification, but it's far from certain that the justicesare ready to make a definitive pronouncement.   In the realm of tax law, the high court faces anotherchallenge, this one issued by the Supreme Court of NorthDakota.   The state court, in effect, vetoed a 1967 high courtdecision limiting states' authority to compel out-of-statecompanies to collect from consumers a tax on goods usedin-state. The 1967 case, National Bellas Hess Inc. vs.Department of Revenue, said that out-of-state businesses suchas mailorder firms, which don't have a &quot;physical&quot; presencein-state, generally can avoid the use tax.   The North Dakota court observed that retailing has changeda lot in 24 years. For one thing, direct marketing sales --not only by mail, but now also by phone, fax, television andeven personal computer -- have grown to $200 billion from $3billion annually. New technology makes the physical presencestandard obsolete, the North Dakota court ruled. It endorsedthe state's efforts to tax Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill.,office products supplier that solicits catalog business inNorth Dakota.   Prof. Ferdinand Schoettle of the University of MinnesotaLaw School says that the North Dakota court's decision is&quot;highly unusual&quot; but that a re-evaluation of National BellasHess is overdue. The Supreme Court has on a number ofoccasions evaded opportunities to revisit the issue, allowinga rule affecting billions of tax dollars to grow antiquated,Prof. Schoettle asserts.   But in the justices' defense, he observes that a courtwith a small staff of law clerks isn't well suited to keepingtax policy current. Instead, the professor says, &quot;suchproblems may be better solved&quot; by Congress, which can holdhearings and gradually amend the law based on changingconditions. Indeed, if lawmakers can withstand pressure fromthe direct-marketing industry, the high court's decision inthe North Dakota case could be eclipsed by legislation nowpending on Capitol Hill.</TEXT></DOC>
