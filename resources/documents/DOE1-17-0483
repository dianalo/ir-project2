Results are reported for both quick and slowheating, and also for sudden changes in oxygen partial pressure. At constanttemperature we observe that the response to the oxygen partial pressureis both quick and reversible. We show evidence that quick heating ispreferable, and we also observe features in the resistance similar tothose reported in bulk samples and interpreted as an order--disordertransition of oxygen in the one-dimensional Cu-O chains.</TEXT></DOC>
