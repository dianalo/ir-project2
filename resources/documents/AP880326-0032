In other developments Friday, the Sandinista government'snewspaper Barricada said citizens should now prepare forideological warfare. And the U.S.-supported Contra rebels indicatedthey would resume fighting if reconciliation talks don't achievegreater political freedom.   The Defense Ministry said a 5-day-old cease-fire appeared to beholding.   The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, a coalition of fourleading political parties, two labor unions and professional andbusiness organizations, said Wednesday's peace accord represented``positive advances to obtain real and effective peace inNicaragua.''   But the coalition rejected the `National Dialogue'' agreementthe leftist government signed two days earlier with eight smallerpolitical parties not affiliated with the Coordinate.   In a statement, it called the agreement ``contrary to theinterest of the people of Nicaragua in their efforts (to promote)democratization and freedom.''   By signing the pact, the Sandinistas sought to separatenegotiations on democratic reform from talks with the Contras, theCoordinate said.   The Sandinistas and Contras agreed Wednesday to maintain theircease-fire until June 1, hoping negotiations to begin April 6 inManagua will by then have forged a lasting peace.   The Contras agreed not to accept any more U.S. military aid.   Under the agreement, reached in the southern border town ofSapoa, the Sandinistas promised a gradual amnesty and unrestrictedfreedom of expression that would allow the Contras a role inNicaragua's political process.   But the Contras' future political role is unclear _ and thatconcerns the Coordinate. Under the Sapoa agreement, up to eightContra leaders would be allowed to participate in the so-calledNational Dialogue.   Ramiro Gurdian, Coordinate vice president, said he hoped Contraswill begin a ``tripartite dialogue'' with the government and theCoordinate.   The National Dialogue, begun in October with 15 oppositionparties, reached an impasse two months later when the governmentrefused to discuss opposition proposals for modifying a newconstitution that went into effect in January.   Carlos Huembes, president of the Coordinate, said Friday thatdomestic economic and political pressures, as well as internationalopinion, had forced the Sandinistas to the negotiating table.   ``We all know about the decomposition and lack of politicalpluralism existing in Nicaragua. We all know and understand theeconomic crisis the Sandinista government is foundering in and thelack of international credibility and aid that the Sandinista fronthas lost,'' he said.   Barricada said in an editorial that the cease-fire agreementmeans the 6-year-old civil war will enter a new phase: ``On aninternal political level, this means the incorporation of pressuregroups, that even though disarmed, continue to be armedideologically against the popular power and its conquests.''   Jorge Rosales, a Contra spokesman in Miami, indicated that ifdemocracy is not achieved through the Sapoa accords, the Contrascould renew their armed fight: ``If we can't do it peacefully, ifthe Sandinsitas do not want to achieve democracy, then the reasonsNicaraguans took up arms will still be there.''   Carlos Huembes, president of the Coordinate, said Friday thatdomestic economic and political pressures, as well as internationalopinion, had forced the Sandinistas to the negotiating table.   ``We all know about the decomposition and lack of politicalpluralism existing in Nicaragua. We all know and understand theeconomic crisis the Sandinista government is foundering in and thelack of international credibility and aid that the Sandinista fronthas lost,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
