We greatly value the municipal services provided to Cornell University. At the same time, Cornell and its sister institutions, as a matter of public policy, have been granted a legal exemption from paying property taxes for such services. The university is also legally entitled to government services.    As Mr. Lifton notes, Cornell and many universities -- including Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard -- have, at their discretion, chosen to make voluntary contributions to support local services. But the comparisons Mr. Lifton has chosen to draw tell only a fraction of the story. He notes that Harvard and MIT contribute between $700,000 and $800,000 annually in support of local government services. He grossly understated Cornell's financial contributions, which he listed at $350,000, omitting nearly $90,000 in fees for building permits in the past year alone. He neglects to note that our sister institutions in Boston are provided street maintenance by their municipalities. In contrast, Cornell is responsible for the maintenance of some 15 miles of roadways -- virtually all of which are available to the public -- at an annual cost of more than $1 million. That represents roughly two-thirds the annual expenditure on road maintenance by the city of Ithaca.    Cornell annually pays $190,000 for that portion of real estate we own that is subject to property taxes; put in perspective, that figure ranks the university fifth among all property taxpayers in Tompkins County. And what would the county's tax coffers be like if we hadn't purchased from local vendors some $82 million in goods and services last year?    Our stable employment base contributes heavily to the county's 2.5% unemployment rate, the lowest in New York state. A recent report by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates of Philadelphia found that growth in research expenditures by Cornell is expected to add between 700 and 4,200 new jobs, and between $680 million and $2.2 billion to personal income, in a 13-county region around the university by the year 2000.
