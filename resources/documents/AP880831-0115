Aides to Democrat MichaelDukakis said they would use Bush's selection of Dan Quayle as hisrunning mate to question the Republican nominee's judgment.   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said the DemocraticNational Committee and the campaign were preparing separateadvertising campaigns to kick off the fall campaign after LaborDay. Among the campaign's targets for the fall: the choice of theIndiana senator for the GOP ticket.   ``Dan Quayle is going to emerge not only as an issue, but as aliability on the Republican side because it goes to judgment and itgoes to leadership,'' Estrich said at a briefing on Dukakiscampaign strategy.   The Democratic nominee raised questions about Bush's leadershipability on Tuesday in resurrecting the Iran-Contra scandal, asking,``How can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we tradedarms to a terrorist nation?''   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas said today that Bush hasyet to explain his role in the arms-for-hostages deal, whichcreates a ``very serious issue of George Bush's judgment.'' Hiscomments came on ``CBS This Morning.''   Dukakis was to continue his attack on Bush's role in the scandalat an afternoon news conference with Maine Sen. George Mitchell,who served on the congressional panel investigating the affair andco-authored a newly published book on Iran-Contra.   The vice president, who turned his attention to the environmentduring a brief campaign stop alongside Lake Erie near Detroit,proposed several clean-up measures as well as a global conferenceon the issue.   ``The time for study alone has passed. ... As president I willask for a program to cut millions of tons of sulfur dioxideemissions by the year 2,000 and to significantly reduce nitrogenoxide emissions as well,'' he said.   Aides traveling with the vice president described his pledge asa step beyond Reagan administration policy. Environmentalists havecriticized the president for dragging his feet on acid rain andother issues during his tenure.   Bush proclaimed, ``I am an environmentalist, always have been,from my earliest days as a congressman ... and I always will be.''   The vice president, for the first time in several days, made noreference to his Democratic rival, but aides said he wasconsidering a trip to Boston Harbor in the Massachusetts governor'shome state to dramatize the pollution problem.   Quayle, meanwhile, traveled to Louisiana with his wife, Marilyn,as part of a five-state southern swing.   The Dukakis campaign today tried to dispel reports of lingeringtension between the Dukakis camp and Jesse Jackson over how theformer candidate would campaign for the Democratic ticket.   Estrich and Dukakis aide Jack Corrigan denied they had eversuggested to Jackson that he avoid campaigning in such states asMichigan, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas.   Sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said Tuesdaythat Jackson resisted attempts to limit the states in which hecampaigns, but it was still unresolved where and when Dukakis andJackson would appear together.   On Tuesday, Bush ridiculed Dukakis' snowblower _ the prizedemblem of the Democratic presidential nominee'sbudget-consciousness _ during one of several appearances in whichhe continued to criticize Dukakis as weak on defense.   ``If he doesn't want to modernize his snowblower, that's hisconcern,'' Bush said at Fort Campbell, Ky., referring to the25-year-old snowblower that figured prominently in a film aboutDukakis at the Democratic National Convention. ``But if he doesn'tmodernize our weapons systems, that puts the national security ofthe United States in considerable risk.''   Dukakis, resurrecting the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal asa campaign issue, said Bush was head of an anti-terrorism taskforce that had issued a report denouncing any concessions toterrorist nations.   ``The president and the vice president and a number of otherpeople, over the opposition of the secretary of state and thesecretary of defense, by the way, proceeded to do precisely whatthat commission said you should never do,'' Dukakis said at a newsconference during a tour of Western Massachusetts.   ``Making tough decisions is a test of leadership,'' Dukakissaid. ``George Bush endorsed the decision to sell arms to Iran andin doing so he failed that test.''   Dukakis was spending most of today at the MassachusettsStatehouse before flying to California for three days ofcampaigning in Western states. His running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsenof Texas, was taking the day off hunting in Wyoming.   On Tuesday, officials of the Dukakis campaign met with theircounterparts in Bush's campaign to begin negotiations on a debateschedule and format.   Both sides reported being far apart. The Republicans say theywant two presidential debates and one confrontation between vicepresidential contenders, but nothing before Sept. 22. The Democratswant a more extensive schedule.</TEXT></DOC>
