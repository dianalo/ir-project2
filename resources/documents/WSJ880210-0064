Hudson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F LABOR EUROP </CO><IN> AUT </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The costly strike against Ford Motor Co. in Britain is driving home a sober lesson to manufacturers throughout Europe: New factory techniques, far from weakening the region's restive unions, are enhancing labor's power to disrupt production and slow the badly needed modernization of European industry.    In recent years, Ford stood out in Europe as an advocate of cost-cutting manufacturing methods used in Japan. It computerized factories, slashed inventories and boosted productivity. The big U.S. auto maker linked diverse European factories into one giant car- and truck-making machine. Ford Sierras, assembled in Belgium, ran on French-made transmissions powered by British engines. Ford's market share grew, particularly in the United Kingdom's highly competitive market.    &quot;The downside (of this modernization) is what we're seeing now,&quot; a spokesman for Ford's U.K. unit acknowledged.    Ford's European juggernaut stalled within hours of a walkout Monday by 32,500 British workers. Without U.K. parts, some Ford production lines in Belgium have shut down, with 2,500 workers laid off yesterday at one plant and 100 more at another. At a small factory in England, 180 workers joined the strike. Analysts expect closures to spread quickly to other countries. Each day that Ford loses production of 2,930 vehicles, it sacrifices at least #19.5 million ($34.1 million) in retail sales.    The auto maker's troubles are sending a shudder throughout the board rooms of Europe's leading manufacturers. To many executives, the Ford dispute dramatizes the one great risk of the new manufacturing techniques: a strike.    Walkouts &quot;will grind operations to a halt far more quickly&quot; than usual, said Patrick McHugh, head British manufacturing-technology consultant for Coopers andamp; Lybrand, the U.S. consulting firm. The new methods cut costly inventories, and without big stockpiles of parts, strikes immediately close assembly lines.    A long Ford strike -- and all signs point to a protracted dispute over pay and changes in working practices -- means &quot;there's going to be a lot of (European) people who are going to be quite panicky&quot; about emulating such manufacturing methods, Mr. McHugh said. At the least, the Ford walkout may force European companies adopting these techniques to crack down on strike-prone suppliers and speed efforts to curb their own walkouts.    At the worst, the Ford dispute may slow the modernization of Europe's antiquated industrial base, which could have serious economic repercussions. Adoption of the new, money-saving techniques lies &quot;at the root of everybody's survival,&quot; said John Parnaby, director of manufacturing technology for Lucas Industries PLC, a British auto-parts maker and Ford supplier.    &quot;We've seen how devastating the Japanese have been&quot; in grabbing sales from U.S. and European manufacturers by honing factory methods, Mr. Parnaby observed. And European manufacturers already lag Japanese and U.S. rivals in embracing the new factory methods.    A big reason is money. So-called computer-integrated manufacturing, for example, requires new computer systems costing millions of dollars just for one factory. But despite potential savings, the high computer price tags have turned off many European concerns. Another obstacle is cultural. &quot;Just-in-time&quot; manufacturing, an established Japanese technique adopted by Ford, goes against the old-line methods in most European factories. With it, teams of assembly workers call for parts only when they're needed, reducing stocks of partly finished products that usually accumulate in factories and cutting the cost of financing those inventories.    Unions pose an even bigger stumbling block to European industry modernization. Europe long has had difficult labor relations, with some of the highest strike rates in the world, despite a recent reduction in their frequency.    Europe's auto industry, its most-automated sector, has borne the brunt of strikes' effects on newly modernized plants. Last month, when many managers at Swedish car maker AB Volvo joined a national white-collar strike, Volvo &quot;at once&quot; had to halt its two Swedish car-assembly plants, a company spokesman said. Manual workers remained on the job.    Volvo might have let the hourly workers exhaust their stocks of parts before halting production. But with a modernization program under way, Volvo kept its inventories intentionally low. Rover Group PLC, Britain's state-owned auto maker, ran into a similar problem in late 1986 during plant modernization. Workers struck at a headlight factory of Lucas Industries, which also supplies Rover. In a few days, a Rover car plant closed, costing the company about #10 million, a Rover official said.    Many European concerns may try to cushion strikes' effects by reverting to old ways. Lucas's Mr. Parnaby said newly modernized companies may keep larger &quot;buffer stocks&quot; of unfinished products to for use during short-term strikes, defeating the purpose of the new techniques.    Or, European manufacturers may get tougher with strike-prone suppliers by insisting they make promised payments if labor unrest disrupts parts deliveries. And executives may work harder to avoid strikes, through better employee education about the new manufacturing techniques. </TEXT></DOC>
