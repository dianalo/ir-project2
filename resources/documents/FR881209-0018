It would also not have a significant adverse effecton competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises, in domestic markets. Its purpose is to publish in the regulationsthe test methods and procedures currently used by manufacturers to evaluatecertain animal biologics.<ITAG tagnum="84">Certification Under The Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 601), the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService has determined that this action would not result in adverse economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Its purpose is to codifyin the regulations standard requirements for veterinary biological products.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Standard requirements consist of test methods, procedures, and criteriaestablished by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for evaluatingbiological products for purity, safety, potency, and efficacy. Until suchstandard requirements for a given biological product are codified in theregulations (9 CFR Part 113), the test methods, procedures, and criteriato be used in the evaluation of the product are developed by the licenseesand are written into the applicable Outlines of Production which are requiredto be filed with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service for eachveterinary biological product. Outlines of production are required to beapproved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.When uniform standard requirements for a biological product have been approvedby the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, they are proposed forcodification in the regulations. Each of the standard requirement testmethods proposed in these amendments has been used for evaluation of atleast two currently licensed products. Development of such requirementis accomplished through cooperative efforts involving academic institutes,research organizations, licensees and applicants, and the National VeterinaryServices Laboratories. Codification assures uniformity and general availabilityof the standard requirements.These proposed amendments contain the standard requirements for all productscontaining live and modified live pasteurella haemolytica bacteria andpasteurella multocida bacteria, live chlamydia psittaci, and killed bovinevirus diarrhea virus and bovine rhinotracheitis virus.To allow for the addition of the proposed standard requirements for killedvirus vaccines, and new standard requirements in the future, certain sectionsin this part would be redesignated.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 113.</ITAG>Animal biologics.Accordingly, 9 CFR Part 113 would be amended as follows:1.

All serials of vaccine shall be prepared fromthe first through the fifth passage from the Master Seed.(a) The Master Seed shall meet the applicable general requirements prescribedin andSection; 113.64 and the requirements in this section.(b) Each lot of Master Seed used for vaccine production shall be testedfor immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of a selected bacterial count fromthe lot of Master Seed shall be established as follows:(1) Fifteen <T3>Pasteurella haemolytica </T3>susceptible calves shall be used as testanimals (10 vaccinates and 5 controls) for each route of administrationrecommended on the label.(2) An arithmetic mean count of the colony forming units from vaccine producedfrom the highest passage of the Master Seed shall be established beforethe immunogenicity test is conducted. The 10 calves to be used as vaccinatesshall be injected as recommended on the label with a predetermined quantityof vaccine bacteria. The five control calves shall be held separately fromthe vaccinates. To confirm the dosage calculation, five replicate titrationsshall be conducted on a sample of the bacterial vaccine used. Only platescontaining between 30 and 300 colonies shall be considered in a valid test.(3) The vaccinates and controls shall be examined and their average bodytemperature determined prior to challenge. Fourteen to twenty-one dayspostvaccination, the vaccinates and controls shall each be challenged bythe respiratory route with a (virulent) pneumonia producing <T3>Pasteurella haemolytica </T3> serotype 1 culture and observed for 5to 7 days. The challenge culture and instructions for preparation for useshall be furnished or approved by the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService.   (4) A satisfactory challenge shall be evidenced in the controls by progressionof clinical signs consistent with respiratory system infection followingchallenge, including but not limited to lacrimation, mucoid nasal exudates,expiratory dyspnea, tachypnea, pulmonary rales, and cough possibly terminatingin death; moribundity, depression with anorexia; diarrhea with substantialweight loss; or any combination of these symptoms.   (5) Lung lesion response to challenge will be assessed in all calves. Lunglesions will be assessed at necropsy in calves that succumb to challenge.Surviving calves will be euthanized on day five to seven following challengeand lung lesions assessed at necropsy. Lung lesion scores will be usedin the assessment of the response to challenge exposure. If a significantdifference in lung lesion scores cannot be demonstrated between vaccinatesand controls using a scoring system approved by the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service, the Master Seed is unsatisfactory.

To be eligible for release, eachserial and subserial shall have a colony count sufficiently greater thanthat of the vaccine used in the immunogenicity test to assure that, whentested at anytime within the expiration period, each serial and subserialshall have a bacterial count at least two times greater than that usedin such immunogenicity test.(ii) If the average count of the initial test is less than the requiredminimum, the serial or subserial may be retested one time using four additionalfinal container vials. If the average count of the four vials is less thanthe required minimum, the serial or subserial is unsatisfactory. If theaverage count of the four vials is not less than the minimum count andthe average count of the initial test is less than one-third the retestcount, the initial test will be considered the result of test system errorand the serial or subserial is satisfactory. If the average count of thefour vials is not less than the minimum count and the average of the initialtest is one-third or more of the retest count, a new average count shallbe determined from the counts of all six vials.
