During a news conference in Johannesburg, Mr. Mandela saidthe ANC &quot;commends&quot; Mr. de Klerk for urging parliament to killthe Group Areas and Land Acts and to begin a process thatwould eliminate the Population Registration Act.</LP><TEXT>   Under the Group Areas and Land Acts, the government hasset aside separate places for the different races, with theminority white population getting the most and the bestplaces. Mr. de Klerk changed an earlier government positionthat the Population Registration Act, which classifies peopleby race, couldn't be eliminated until a new constitution isin place; He didn't make clear, however, how the populationregistration system would be ended.   Mr. Mandela called for a continuation of sanctions againstSouth Africa because the vast majority of its citizens &quot;stillhave no votes. We cannot become MPs (members of parliament).The police are still harassing, persecuting and even killingour people.&quot;   Nonetheless, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said theBritish Commonwealth foreign ministers should hold a specialmeeting to consider a phased lifting of sanctions.   The U.S. Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 demandsrepeal of the Group Areas and Population Registration Acts.While there is some flexibility, the U.S. can't end sanctionsuntil all political prisoners are released, an issue ignoredin Mr. de Klerk's Friday address. Estimates of the number ofpolitical prisoners range to as many as 3,000.   The ANC said the government's &quot;numerous repressive andsecurity laws . . . are among the most obstinate obstacles inthe path of free political activity. President de Klerk'ssilence on the release of political prisoners, ending allpolitical trials and the return of the exiles is also causefor alarm.&quot;   Much of the improved atmosphere in South Africa is theresult of the close working relationship between Mr. de Klerkand Mr. Mandela.   Some observers fear that relationship may be damaged bythe trial of Mr. Mandela's wife, Winnie, scheduled to begintoday.   She is charged with assault and kidnapping in aprosecution that the African National Congress calls anexample of continuing political harassment against her. Mrs.Mandela and seven others -- some of whom were her bodyguards-- are charged in connection with the December 1988 death ofStompie Seipei, a 14-year-old activist in Soweto. Oneex-bodyguard already was sentenced to death for his part inthe murder. Four of the defendants have skipped bail.   Whilesaying it has no confidence in the South African judicialsystem, the ANC has said the trial will give Mrs. Mandela anopportunity to tell her side of the story. Neither Mr.Mandela nor others in the ANC leadership have been stridentin their criticism of Mrs. Mandela's prosecution, and aspokesman for the organization said he doubts the trial willdisrupt ANC-government dealings.   The ANC's reaction was generally supportive of Mr. deKlerk. It said the &quot;Manifesto for a New South Africa&quot; issuedby Mr. de Klerk &quot;constitutes a fundamental departure from theapartheid framework.&quot; The manifesto commits South Africa touniversal adult suffrage, equality before the law and theprotection of individual and minority rights &quot;defined on anon-racial basis&quot; in a constitution and bill of rights.   That kind of democratic talk led Conservative Partymembers of parliament to walk out in protest during Mr. deKlerk's speech, calling him a traitor. Their opposition isunlikly to prevent approval of Mr. de Klerk's proposals.Outside of parliament and in cities across the nation,thousands demonstrated peacefully for democracy during hisspeech.   In an apparent effort to gain support for his programamong whites who face democracy reluctantly, Mr. de Klerktook out a full page advertisement in Sunday papers.&quot;Politicans can work out a new South Africa, but they can'tmake it work,&quot; the ad says. &quot;Only you can do that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
