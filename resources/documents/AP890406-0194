Then-Vice President Bush served as an intermediary for PresidentReagan in assuring the president of Honduras in the spring of 1985of expedited U.S. military and economic aid, according to a 42-page``admission of facts'' agreed to by the government and read to thejury by North's defense attorneys.   The document established a ``quid pro quo'' relationship betweencontinuing third-country assistance to the Contras and theavailability of U.S. assistance to those countries. But Bush wasnot described in the document as having cited such a linkage in hisMay 1985 meeting with then-President Roberto Suazo of Honduras.   The document, nevertheless, revealed Bush as actually playing arole in the effort to keep the Contras alive as a fighting forceduring the period of the Boland Amendment prohibition on Americaninvolvement. This is a portrait of Bush that never emerged in thefinal Iran-Contra investigative reports by a presidential reviewboard and a joint congressional committee.   Asked Thursday about the revelation of Bush's go-between rolewith the Honduran leader who was being pressed by the United Statesto continue helping the Contras, White House press secretary MarlinFitzwater said: ``We can't say anything. It would become a part ofthe case.''   Bush declined to comment on the document when asked about it ata dinner party for visiting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.Bush said he hadn't seen the document, ``and I don't worry aboutit.''   Both the presidential commission, headed by former Sen. JohnTower, R-Texas, and the congressional panels, found no meaningfulrole by Bush in the scandal that resulted from the covert sales ofU.S. arms to Iran and the subsequent diversion of the proceeds tothe Nicaraguan resistance fighters.   Bush has said that he supported Reagan's Iranian arms-saleinitiative, but that he voiced reservations about what would happenif it ever became public.   Portions of the document read Thursday did, however, show Bushas an enthusiastic supporter of the effort to tide over the Contrasuntil direct U.S. assistance could be resumed.   In early March 1985, for instance, Bush asked then-nationalsecurity advisor Robert McFarlane to say whether he (the vicepresident) should ``encourage a private group to donate a planeloadof medical supplies that would arrive in Honduras coincident with''Bush's meeting with Suazo.   ``Bush strongly favored such a flight,'' the document said,``noting that the (unidentified) group was supportive of theresistance.'' It said that North told McFarlane that Bush's ideawas a sound one. The document did not reveal whether the planeloadof supplies actually arrived in conjunction with his visit.   Bush has denied ever having any knowledge of a diversion ofarms-sales proceeds to the Contras. And Donald Gregg, nationalsecurity adviser to Bush when Bush was vice president, hastestified that he did not pass on to Bush information about Contraresupply effort that Gregg had learned from Felix Rodriguez, aone-time Gregg CIA associate.   A source involved in the Iran-Contra congressionalinvestigation, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Thursday thatBush ``didn't leave very many footprints anywhere. It needs to besaid that the extent of his knowledge was not our major goal. Wewere more interested in what the president (Reagan) knew.''   But this source also said that ``it was because he (Bush) leftso few footprints, I think, that he was treated so well in the(final investigative) report'' by the congressional panel.   Victoria Goldstein, a spokeswoman at the Honduran Embassy here,said she had no information about the Bush-Suazo meeting. But shesaid, ``The embassy would not have been involved.''   According to the document, Bush personally told Suazo during theMay 1985 in Honduras that extra aid was being funneled to hiscountry. In earlier testimony, McFarlane had said the aid was partof a secret agreement calling for Honduras to help the Contras.   McFarlane testified that Reagan personally approved the secretdeal to slip $110 million in extra aid to Honduras as one ofseveral ``quid pro quo'' arrangements with other countries inexchange for support for the Contras.   McFarlane said in cross-examination that Reagan telephoned Suazoto gain the release of an arms shipment to the Contras that hadbeen seized by a Honduran military commander.   The statement entered in court Thursday said: ``Vice PresidentBush also informed Suazo that President Reagan had directed thatcurrently withheld economic assistance for Honduras should bereleased, that the United States would provide from its ownmilitary stocks critical security assistance items that had beenordered by Honduran armed forces, and that several securityprograms under way for Honduran security forces would be enhanced.''   In a Dec. 3, 1986 speech to the American Enterprise Institutehere _ little more than a week after the Iran-Contra affair brokeinto public view _ Bush said that while he was aware of Reagan'sIranian initiative and had supported it, ``I was not aware of _ andoppose _ any diversion of funds, any ransom payments or anycircumvention of the will of the Congress.''   The document also revealed that Bush saw several North memorandainvolving the secret U.S. effort to aid the Contras, although itdid not contradict Bush's assertions that he never knew about thediversion of the Iranian arms-sales proceeds to the resistance.   At another point, the document shows that Bush was included inthe distribution of a memo making it clear that leaders ofGuatemala were conditioning continued support for the Contras on adoubling of U.S. economic assistance to Guatemala.</TEXT></DOC>
