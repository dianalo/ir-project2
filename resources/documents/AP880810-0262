(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Farm Workers leader Cesar Chavezpersisted Wednesday for a 25th day of a water-only fast, the samelength of time he went without food in 1968 to gain recognition ofhis union.   The 61-year-old Chavez remained bedridden but in stablecondition Wednesday as he picked up support from two officials ofother unions representing nearly 3 million workers.   Chavez says he is fasting to promote a consumer boycott ofCalifornia table grapes, whose growers refuse to sign unioncontracts and use pesticides he says endanger field workers andtheir families.   ``Cesar has raised the ante. He has made us feel ashamed,'' saidGerald McEntee, president of the 1 million-member AmericanFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees. He promised tourge members to hit the streets and support the four-year-oldboycott.   ``Cesar Chavez in the minds of many of us represents the soul ofthe American labor movement,'' said Jack Henning,secretary-treasurer of the 1.9-million member California LaborFederation.   Henning acknowleged the boycott hasn't taken hold even inCalifornia but said the public is beginning to realize thesacrifice by Chavez and his message.   ``The implementation of a boycott in the long term is not aneasy task. We have a renewal here through Cesar's fast,'' saidHenning.   Hollywood stars and children of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedyhave traveled to Delano in recent weeks to publicize the boycott.But these visits and the ensuing publicity have had a negligibleeffect on California table grape sales, according to stateregulators and a California Grocers Association official.</TEXT></DOC>
