Qualitatively, one mightstate that understanding of XeCl is now comparable to the other majorexcimers. Much of the mystery associated with the XeCl kinetics has beenlifted. For example, significant vibrational excitation of HCl appearsto be occurring as indirectly indicated by the behavior of the electrondensity. The exact character of the electron energy distribution andits affect on the kinetics is now better understood. The distributionis not entirely Maxwellian, as was generally assumed by models beforethis work. Instead, only the low energy distribution (the distributionbelow the ionization energy of xenon) is Maxwellian; the high-energydistribution is non-Maxwellian. Ultimately, the interest is in improvingthe performance of XeCl lasers, in particular, scaling them to longerpulse lengths. As mentioned earlier, control of halogen depletion iscrucial for achieving long pulse lengths.</TEXT></DOC>
