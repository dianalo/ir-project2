StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. Federal Reserve joined other major central banks in coordinated buying of dollars in foreign-exchange markets, traders said, prompting a rebound in the U.S. currency's value.    The dollar's recovery from its drop to record lows Monday was aided by speculation that the West German Bundesbank will cut its discount rate tomorrow. Such a move would widen the gap between U.S. interest rates and the lower West German rates and thus increase the appeal of dollar-denominated investments.    The dollar rose 1% against the West German currency yesterday, to 1.6558 marks in late New York trading from 1.6386 late Monday.    The central bank intervention was magnified by the day's relatively thin volume, traders said. In addition, many dealers bought dollars to cover short, or oversold, positions as soon as the central banks appeared on the scene.    The intervention did little to change the overall negative market sentiment on the dollar, however, and traders viewed the action as intended only to prevent an unfettered fall of the U.S. currency.    &quot;They're not trying to reverse the trend; they're just trying to slow it. Everyone is still very bearish&quot; on the dollar, Robert Paul, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Bank of Boston, said.    In other late New York dealings, the dollar climbed 0.9% to 133.38 Japanese yen from 132.24 Monday, and the British pound fell similarly to $1.8103 from $1.8275.    The pound, however, firmed to 2.9975 marks from 2.9945, largely on the belief that Britain won't match the expected West German rate cut. That would widen the yield spread in favor of sterling-denominated investments.    In early Tokyo trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 133.17 yen.    As usual, the Fed wouldn't comment on its reported activity. But dealers familiar with the central bank's operations said it bought dollars yesterday. Dealers also said the West German, British and Dutch central banks intervened in European markets and the Bank of Japan bought dollars in Tokyo trading. The Swiss National Bank confirmed that it bought dollars against the Swiss franc yesterday but didn't specify the amount.    Some dealers estimated that the central bank purchases in the U.S. and Europe yesterday totaled between $500 million and $1 billion.    By market standards, that would represent more than a token amount of buying but not necessarily enough to guarantee a significant impact on exchange rates. But with yesterday's trading relatively light, a few large orders were enough to move currency rates.    Many dealers were holding short dollar positions yesterday, reflecting a dim view of the currency's future in light of the continuing large U.S. trade and budget deficits. But the intervention spurred many dealers to protect themselves against a rally by buying dollars, which assisted the currency's rebound.    &quot;People are nervous about all the central banks intervening to support the dollar,&quot; Mr. Paul said. None of the banks' purchases were really large, he said, &quot;but if they decided to do a lot more, they could really push it&quot; (the dollar) higher.    Despite the reported move by the Fed to support the dollar through intervention yesterday, many traders remain convinced that the Reagan administration wants the currency to fall further. The U.S. has long sought a weaker dollar as a means of reducing its trade deficit by making imports more expensive and increasing the cost-competitiveness of U.S. exports.    Traders also contend that the administration is encouraging the dollar's decline to press West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies and spur world-wide consumption of U.S. exports.    &quot;The U.S. is forcing the dollar down as a tool to force West Germany and Japan to move faster,&quot; Alfred Driever, vice president, foreign exchange, at Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, said.    Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said the absence of any official U.S. comment during the dollar's plunge Monday was seen as a bearish sign. &quot;No comment is viewed as endorsing the lower dollar,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce to $490.40 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.6 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $489.75 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Tuesday, Dec. 1, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
