(on-line services)andM;</TITLE><SUMMARY>On-line information services available in the United Kingdom arediscussed.andP;  Electronic mail is not as widely used in the UK as inthe US but is growing rapidly.andP;  Simple bulletin board systems(BBSs) let users post notices and often have large libraries ofdownloadable software.andP;  CompuLink Information Exchange (CIX) is anelectronic conferencing system based on the American ByteInformation Exchange.andP;  It has about 500 conferences at any onetime, some of which are run by equipment manufacturers; CIX coversnearly all computer topics.andP;  MicroLink offers messaging, bulletinboards, news services, databases, games, and purchasing.andP;  Manyhardware and software manufacturers operate BBSs for technicalsupport.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     On-LineComputer Bulletin BoardsInformation ServicesCommunications Service Suppliers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Anybody there?andM;Once you've bought your modem and communications package, what do you do withit?andP;  Almost certainly you have an area of interest that can only be realizedusing a modem, otherwise you wouldn't have bought it.andP;  On-line services --services accessible from your PC using a modem -- can be divided into thefollowing broad categories: remote databases, electronic mail, bulletinboards, fax/telex services and entertainment.andM;On-line information providers have been around for many years: the providersets up a computer system with dial-in facilities and assembles one or moredatabases with methods of interrogating them for desired data.andP;  Searchingsuch databases is a lengthy and often expensive process, but for manycompanies this is an essential part of their business.andM;Most of the databases available concentrate on six broad areas: finance,company information, news, legal, travel and medicine.andM;Electronic mail (e-mail) has not yet caught on in the national sense to theextent that it has in the United States, although it is widely usedinternationally between parent and subsidiary companies.andP;  The major reasonfor this is size -- branches of the same company in the US can be severalthousands of miles and time zones apart, thus giving incentive to the idea ofeasily accessible electronic mailboxes.andP;  As the European market creeps,snail-like, towards being a reality, the use of e-mail will grow.andP;  A boost tothis process will possibly occur (sometime, maybe?) when the X500 protocol isimplemented -- and anyone who has tried to send mail using X400 will havecome across the problem of addressing messages.andM;Simple bulletin boards are exactly what they sound like; the electronicequivalent of the office notice board.andP;  There are hundreds operating in theUK, varying in their tendencies, and most of these have large volumes ofsoftware that may be downloaded.andP;  Some of this is a bit dubious and is onepotential way of contracting a virus.andP;  However, a large proportion of boardsare games-playing systems, while others deal with organic gardening, medicineor astronomy, for example, or with information relating to a specificmachine.andP;  Some are organized to enable electronic conferences to take place,the best-known being CIX, the Compulink Information eXchange.andM;Technical support bulletin board systems (BBS) are worth a separate mention.andO;In the documentation supplied with many packages, you will find the number,often in the US, of the technical support bulletin boards.andP;  These can beinvaluable as a means of keeping up to date on bug fixes, new releases, plushints and tips.andM;For example, the Logitech BBS (0101 415 795 0408) has the latest mousedrivers available for download, mouse menu definitions for many more packagesthan are on the software disks issued with the mice, and technical supportnotes on various packages and topics.andP;  I have downloaded some, and althoughthis entails calling the US, a five-minute call at 2,400bps gives a lot ofdata and costs 2.99 pound sterling.andM;If you would like telex facilities but cannot justify a telex connection, youcan use one of a number of on-line telex services, at varying costs dependingon which service you use.andP;  Similarly, fax is available on-line, but neitherof these are as good as the real thing -- incoming telex messages are notdelivered automatically, and it is up to you how often you log on to theservice to check for incoming messages.andM;Fax communication is generally two-way, and being able to send faxes, whileuseful, usually implies that the other party will send faxes to you as well.andO;In this case, you will need to arrange with a neighbourhood copy/fax bureauto receive faxes on your behalf.andM;On-line services in practiceandM;Having outlined the sort of services available, let's look at two in detail-- CIX and MicroLink.andM;CIX is based on BIX, the Byte Information eXchange run by Byte magazine inthe US.andP;  These systems are intended to facilitate the exchange of informationbetween participants and extend the bulletin board concept to provideconferences.andP;  Participants in a conference can review messages and addcomments, and download and upload information, including source and objectprograms.andM;If you are interested in this type of activity, CIX is the best bet -- thereare about 500 conferences at any one time.andP;  Some have a limited life; othersare more permanent like Borland's conference, which comprises 15 topics,including support topics for each of their products.andP;  Borland has beenrunning its support conferences on CIX for three years and considers it asuccessful and valuable facet of its support operation.andM;Most PC magazines have conferences, and many other areas are covered,including communications, programming languages, operating systems andapplication software.andM;If you have computer hardware or software to sell, or even your car or house,it is worth putting an ad in CIX conferences -- I sold some equipmentrecently that was so old I was surprised anyone even remembered it!andM;Anyone may start a conference and is then known as the moderator of thatconference.andP;  Closed conferences may be created, such as the Pfizer HospitalProducts International Conference used as a file swapping facility between aUK subsidiary and US parent.andM;I find myself using CIX more and more frequently, and have learnt a lot aboutcommunications through the comms conference.andM;MicroLinkandM;This is other system I used to use extensively -- until it changed fromTelecom Gold to ISTEL!andP;  The old MicroLink, while as primitive as the TelecomGold system ('Dialcom' internationally) to which it provided cheaper access,was at least reasonably easy to get to grips with.andM;The new all-singing, all-dancing MicroLink (or ISTEL INET) is quite thereverse.andP;  Many and loud have the complaints been, the chief of these beingthat the users feel that they are not being adequately informed.andP;  One majorpotential advantage of the ISTEL host for MicroLink is the change from 7-bitto 8-bit communications, but at present it is still only possible to useKermit to upload and download files.andM;The manual describing how to use the system is still not available, andrequests to the help mailbox are still disappearing without trace.andP;  The newservice was launched on 1st October 1989, and during the four weeks since,not a lot appears to have changed; one hopes that by the time this articleappears these complaints will have been effectively addressed.andM;A whole range of facilities is accessible via MicroLink including messaging(e-mail, fax, telex, radio paging), bulletin boards, news services,databases, games and purchasing.andM;One of the bulletin board services on MicroLink, only available to a closeduser group, is LoadLink, basically a load sharing system for the transporttrade.andP;  It also contains details of roadworks, ferry schedules and weatherconditions, and it's hoped to link this to the European Road TransportInformation Service to provide a similar service covering all Europe.andM;Another user is Eidolon, a company making transputer-based raster imageprocessors, which uses MicroLink to liaise between development facilities inLondon and California.andM;This new MicroLink has a great deal of potential, but the user interfaceneeds some work spent on it to make it easier for the novice user to pick up.andO;My main use of MicroLink is as a fax sender and telex facility; I make littleuse of the other features.andP;  I have never yet succeeded in downloadinganything from MicroLink despite numerous attempts!andM;To return to my original question, what are you using on-line services for?andO;I'd be happy to receive comments addressed to china@CIX.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
