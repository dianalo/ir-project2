Garcia</HL><DD> 05/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Blue-chip stocks lost ground, while the broader market posted a small advance amid quiet but volatile trading.    Traders said a weaker bond market, a lower dollar and another jump in commodity prices sidelined some nervous investors. Yesterday morning's report of a narrowing of the March merchandise trade deficit to $13.63 billion from February's $15.06 billion gap was in line with economists' estimates. But the deficit was wider than the rumored trade gap of just $10 billion that circulated through the markets late Tuesday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 4.19 points to 2325.49. The industrial average moved in a narrow band throughout yesterday's session, changing direction as bond prices improved and later sank.    The broader market indexes ended with tiny gains as declining issues outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a slim margin, 776-769. Big Board trading activity was light, with 152 million shares changing hands compared with 171 million Wednesday.    Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.26 to 294.24, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index inched up 0.06 to 165.76.    Continued takeover speculation in Allegis and buying demand for other airline issues helped push the Dow Jones Transportation Average to its second consecutive record yesterday, up 8.55 to 976.04.    Stocks on the American Stock Exchange and in the over-the-counter market scored modest gains.    Monte Gordon, director of research at Dreyfus Corp. in New York, said that while the trade deficit report for March was mildly encouraging, he believes many stock investors remained concerned because they still don't see much stability for the U.S. dollar.    He added that some investors might also be unnerved by the climate in the stock market. He explained that while declining interest rates and decelerating inflation fueled the rally that began in August 1982, the outlook for this year is much different. Most economists believe inflation will rise this year and interest rates have already posted a sharp, rapid gain in the past month or so, Mr. Gordon said.    He and other analysts believe such a shift is feeding the move by investors away from the stocks of companies that thrive in a disinflationary environment and toward more cyclical companies.    Traders said such interest was responsible for some of the demand seen in recent weeks for airline, railroad and oil stocks. Paper, forest products and chemical issues, which moved ahead sharply in the first quarter and ran into some profit-taking in April, now are seeing more buying.    Yesterday, some paper stocks advanced. International Paper moved up 1 3/8 to 94 5/8, James River gained 7/8 to 37, Union Camp rose 2 5/8 to 63 7/8, and Scott Paper added 1 3/8 to 71 1/8.    Chemical stocks were mixed. Du Pont fell 1 1/4 to 116 3/4, Union Carbide eased 1/2 to 29 3/4, and Air Products andamp; Chemicals rose 5/8 to 46 1/4.    Dow Chemical eased 1/4 to 86 3/4, although the company boosted its quarterly common stock dividend five cents to 55 cents. The firm also forecast record second-quarter earnings and sales.    Monsanto sank 2 1/2 to 84 1/8. Massachusetts has banned the use of alachlor, a top-selling herbicide made by Monsanto. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the Massachusetts stance might spur other states to take the same action. Traders said such news might have accounted for the decline in some of the chemical stocks.    Traders said they just didn't see much institutional demand for stocks yesterday.    Sears Roebuck told shareholders at its annual meeting yesterday that it expects record sales and net income. The retailer didn't estimate by how much it would exceed its 1984 record earnings of $1.45 billion, but the news was sufficient to lift the stock from a low of 53 1/4 to close at 54.    International oil stocks were a standout group, attracting both domestic and foreign buyers, traders said. British Petroleum moved up 2 3/4 to 71 7/8; the company reported higher quarterly earnings.    Royal Dutch Petroleum gained 5 7/8 to 134, and Shell Trading andamp; Transportation added 3 1/8 to 89 5/8. Royal Dutch reported a decline in quarterly earnings, but it was much smaller than expected by analysts, traders said.    One trader in New York added that there was also big demand for the stock from investors who were covering positions against options in the Amsterdam market.    International Controls gained 3 7/8 to 43 3/8. ICC Acquisition raised its bid for International Controls to $42.50 a share from $32 and extended the offer to all of the company's common shares.    Federal Express, one of the 20 issues in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, jumped 4 3/8 to 67 7/8. Several analysts told Dow Jones News Service that improved orders for some of the company's package delivery services indicate rising profitability for Federal Express.    Allegis gained 1 7/8 to 71 1/2 on volume of more than 3.5 million shares, making it the second most active Big Board stock. The company, which is the parent of United Airlines, said it was aware of the stock's activity but hadn't any significant corporate developments to report. Coniston Partners, an investment firm, was rumored to be acquiring Allegis stock; the firm declined to comment.    Among the other airlines, USAir rose 7/8 to 45, Delta Air Lines gained 3/4 to 53 3/4, AMR moved up 7/8 to 58, and NWA added 5/8 to 66 1/2. Railroad stocks also moved higher.    General Mills also continued to surge on takeover speculation, gaining 3 1/8 to 54 1/8 on volume of more than 1.4 million shares. The market was awash with rumors of which companies might be possible suitors for General Mills. Among those mentioned were RJR Nabisco, which declined to comment, Philip Morris, Unilever and Nestle.    Allied Bancshares moved up 1 7/8 to 11 in OTC trading. The Houston-based bank said it was in discussions with First Interstate Bancorp. regarding a potential merger. First Interstate fell 1 1/8 to 54 1/4.    Penn Central rose 1 to 57 5/8. The company said it plans to spin off virtually all of the stock of its newly created Sprague Technologies subsidiary.    Minstar, the Minneapolis company controlled by Irwin Jacobs, told shareholders that it's looking at ways to enhance the value of its stocks, including acquisitions or a spinoff of some of Minstar's businesses. The stock rose 1/2 to 22 1/2 in the OTC market. </TEXT></DOC>
