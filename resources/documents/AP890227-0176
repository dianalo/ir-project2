In a prepared statement he read at the foot of the ramp to AirForce One, Bush said his trip to Japan, China and South Koreademonstrated that the United States ``is and will remain a Pacificpower.''   ``It's great to be home. God bless the United States ofAmerica,'' Bush said in the chilly darkness at Andrews Air ForceBase in suburban Maryland. Vice President Dan Quayle was on hand towelcome the new president back from his first overseas voyage.   In his brief statement, the president said he had held``thoughtful and candid conversations'' with world leaders,including the several he met with in Japan, where he attended thefuneral of Emperor Hirohito. From there he went to China for twodays, followed by a five-hour stopover in Seoul.   ``I return tonight pleased with the progress made toward lastingand mutually beneficial relationships,'' Bush said. He said workremains to be done toward encouraging the growth of democracy,working for human rights, strengthening international alliances andopening foreign markets to American goods.   Bush made no direct reference to the Tower nomination in hisairport statement.   But in comments to reporters just before his plane touched down,he said, ``No one has challenged his qualifications to head thePentagon.''   ``I don't have any predictions nor do I plan to except to say Ihaven't wavered one iota and I don't intend to,'' he said.   In assessing his trip, Bush also addressed relations betweenChina and the Soviet Union, although he didn't mention Mikhail S.Gorbachev's springtime visit to Beijing.   ``China approaches its thaw with the Soviets with caution andrealism. We agreed that the Soviets must be judged not by theirrhetoric but by their actions, such as whether the Soviet Unionactually draws down its military forces along China's border andpersists in encouraging Vietnam to completely withdraw fromCambodia,'' Bush said.   Bush also said he agreed with the Chinese that free electionsshould be held in Cambodia after Vietnam occupation ends ``under acoalition government led by Prince Sihanouk...The United Statesremains committed by a result that precludes a return to power bythe Khmer Rouge and the Chinese leaders appreciate our concern andare willing to work toward a peaceful coalition,'' he said.   Tower has been plagued by allegations of drinking and womanizing,as well as possible conflicts of interest stemming from the hundredsof thousands of dollars he received as a defense industry consultantin recent years.   Asked whether Tower's weekend vow of alcohol abstinence wouldhelp his chances, Bush laughed and said, ``I don't know.''   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was meeting withRepublican senators to discuss the nomination shortly after AirForce One landed in Washington.   Aides said the president intended to spare no effort in a bid toprevail in the first high-stakes political struggle of hisadministration. He invited Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell tothe White House for breakfast on Tuesday, the first of severalplanned sessions with Democrats whose votes will be crucial toTower's chances.   Tower's appointment was rejected 11-9 in a party line vote lastweek by the Armed Services Committee, and the full Senate isexpected to take up the appointment beginning on Wednesday.   Bush planned to meet at the White House with 12 Democraticsenators beginning shortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday morning in a bid toget them to ``keep an open mind'' and build support for Tower, saidFitzwater.   The president's aides say they are hopeful that Tower's unusualweekend pledge to abstain from drinking alcohol if confirmed wouldhelp boost his chances.   Fitzwater said that ``should take care of the drinkingsituation'' that many senators said was bothering them.   But prospects for confirmation still appeared difficult.   Defense was also the main subject in Bush's speech earlier Mondayto the National Assembly in Seoul. The president vowed to keep U.S.troops stationed there so long as they were requested by thegovernment to preserve stability.   On another subject, Bush voiced concerns over the U.S.-SouthKorea trade imbalance, both in his speech to the lawmakers and aftera meeting with President Roh Tae-Woo. He suggested that South Koreado more to lower its barriers to U.S. goods.   ``Korea has benefited from the U.S. open markets ... We mustexpect fair access to the markets here,'' Bush said after themeeting with Roh.   Roh voiced support for free markets throughout the world. He saidhe and Bush agreed to work on problems ``resulting from the rapidexpansion of economic relations between our two countries.''   Returning to the West, Bush left a volatile climate in SouthKorea, with anti-American protesters and police clashing in thestreets of at least six cities.   In Seoul, about 700 radical students shouting ``Bush go home!''threw firebombs and rocks at police around Dongguk University in anabortive attempt to march on the U.S. Embassy about three miles away.   Students burned effigies of Bush and Roh Tae-woo at a rally onthe school grounds, and leaders charged that Washington keeps troopsin South Korea to enforce its rule.   Police arrested about 15 prominent dissidents shouting ``no Bushvisit'' who had tried to assemble near the downtown embassy.   The anti-American violence prompted tight security for Bush'sbrief visit, and his trip from a military airfield to town for hismeetings was made by helicopter.</TEXT></DOC>
