ApcarStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FBT GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   For the new management of First City Bancorp. of Texas, the failing Houston-based banking concern, the federal check is in the mail. The only question left for A. Robert Abboud, the man on the receiving end: Is it big enough?    The adequacy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. assistance and the problems posed by Texas's battered banking climate are the major uncertainties in the rescue accord for First City, which could be the second-largest federal banking bailout in history.    Mr. Abboud, a former Chicago banker, leads a group that Wednesday agreed to take over management of First City with $970 million of assistance from the FDIC. Mr. Abboud and his investment bankers from Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. think that is enough to cover the huge losses remaining in First City's troubled loan portfolio.    Indeed, banking officials close to the transaction said that after the FDIC bailout, and the injection of another $500 million Donaldson Lufkin plans to raise in public offerings, First City will immediately be profitable. What's more, the officials have mapped out a plan to cut about $100 million out of First City's bloated annual operating costs, a move that could quickly make the company a better-than-average earner among regional banks.    Others who inspected First City's books, however, said Mr. Abboud may not have gotten enough FDIC money and guarantees. In addition, First City faces increasingly fierce competition for the consumer banking business expected to provide the bulk of the company's future profit.    &quot;It's not a good deal at all,&quot; said Sheldon &quot;Red&quot; Mandell, a Chicago real estate investor who led another bidding group. Mr. Mandell, who is also president of National Wrecking Co., one of the nation's biggest demolition concerns, said he had sought between $200 million and $300 million more from the FDIC than the Abboud group got. And he also asked for a longer period of time to transfer poor-quality loans out of First City.    As reported, the Abboud group would transfer $1.79 billion in poor-quality loans to a separate bank and could transfer a limited amount of loans after that for up to a year's time.    Federal regulators confirmed that Mr. Abboud's offer was, by far, the least costly for them. &quot;This was financially the best deal,&quot; said Robert L. Clarke, the comptroller of the currency and a director of the FDIC. The agency said it expects a loss of between $800 million and $900 million.    Mr. Mandell gave a bleaker view of the collectibility of First City's troubled real estate and energy loans. And he said his investment group feared that lawsuits from borrowers, alleging their loan commitments weren't honored after the Texas economy and First City got into trouble, would prove costly. &quot;It's extremely huge,&quot; he said of the potential litigation expense.    Borrowers have increasingly sued when their credit is cut off, charging that banks' actions killed their businesses. And, during the past two years, some huge jury awards have been made in these so-called lender liability cases. &quot;Any bank, failed or not failed, that has failed borrowers is facing lender liability claims,&quot; said Richard F. Levy, a banking lawyer and partner at the Chicago law firm Kirkland andamp; Ellis.    An official close to the First City agreement said that the Abboud group would be able to transfer litigation losses to the separate bank, where the FDIC will shoulder as much as $870 million in loan losses and other costs. But First City can only transfer so much to the separate bank without having losses exceed that FDIC limit and then become losses once again for First City. The FDIC has been guaranteed that it will receive back at least $100 million of its $970 million bailout.    Mr. Mandell's group had expected to collect about 33 cents on the dollar on First City's nonperforming loans, which were $1.07 billion at June 30, and about 50 cents on the dollar on other loans transferred. That would appear to be enough to keep First City from taking further losses under the Abboud group's agreement, though it would leave little room for error.    &quot;I think it's too skinny,&quot; said an investment banker who worked for one of the losing bidders. &quot;It could work, but there is a substantial risk in it.&quot; As reported, in addition to the Mandell group, MCorp., a big Dallas banking concern that is itself troubled, and Bank of Scotland were bidders.    Lawrence Lavine, a senior vice president at Donaldson Lufkin, said the Abboud group is comfortable with its protection from both loan losses and lawsuits. &quot;If we weren't absolutely comfortable, we wouldn't do it,&quot; he said. &quot;Every bit of forecasting that's been done is based on the view that Houston never gets better. You can't imagine a case where you don't get 30 to 40 cents on the dollar. That's almost inconceivable.&quot;    Mr. Lavine wouldn't comment on fees his firm or Mr. Abboud would be paid. But an official close to the transaction said that Donaldson Lufkin would get more than $25 million for its role as lead underwriter in the $500 million of offerings. And, he said, Mr. Abboud would receive a fee of more than twice his out-of-pocket expenses, which included retaining two accounting firms, two law firms and other consultants. &quot;He did more due diligence than I've ever seen,&quot; the official said.    The official also said that Donaldson Lufkin has told the FDIC that it already has informal commitments from some institutional and large individual investors to buy a large portion of the offered stock. Mr. Lavine wouldn't comment on that. Mr. Abboud was in New York yesterday trying to drum up additional support for the offerings.    Because the FDIC will own just a minority stake in First City, Mr. Abboud will have more freedom to operate than the government-hired managers at Continental Illinois Corp., the 1984 subject of the biggest federal banking bailout. In that case, the agency's majority ownership has drawn repeated complaints from Continental's competitors that they are vying with Uncle Sam for acquisitions or new business.    But with the independence afforded the new First City management also comes greater risk for the principals. The Continental bailout carried an FDIC guarantee of any needed additional assistance. Should First City run through its FDIC help, private capital will be lost.    After the bailout, First City would have a primary capital-to-assets ratio of more than 6%, virtually no known problem loans, but operating costs built for a bank twice its size. Last year, such expenses were $509.1 million, and investment bankers and others say Mr. Abboud must trim that by 20% or more, meaning layoffs and other painful cuts. One official said that plans to establish a reserve for severance payments are already in the works.    Since the beginning of 1984, when First City's payroll was at its peak, the company has cut 15.6% of its personnel to 7,432 workers June 30.    Also, while Mr. Abboud declared Wednesday that &quot;the offense begins today,&quot; his advisers and federal officials said that was designed to reassure jittery customers and employees. &quot;Bob, for now, is going to have to play the politician,&quot; an adviser said, adding that Mr. Abboud would move slowly and carefully in making any new loans and that cutting costs will get far more attention. </TEXT></DOC>
