We are also removing all references to ``VeterinaryServices'' and replacing them with references to ``Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service.'' These changes are necessary to clarify that authorityunder these regulations is held by the Administrator, Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service, and not by the Deputy Administrator, VeterinaryServices, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Steven B. Farbman, Assistant Director,Regulatory Coordination, PPD, APHIS, USDA, Room 728, Federal Building,Hyattsville, MD 20782; 301-436-5533.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The regulations in 9 CFR Part 94 concernthe importation into the United States of certain meat and animal products.Prior to the effective date of this document, these regulations statedthat the Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services, of the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service, is responsible for various decisions made pursuantto the regulations. However, this is not correct. Authority and responsibilitybelongs to the Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.Therefore, to clarify the regulations with respect to the Administrator'sauthority and responsibility, we are making nonsubstantive changes in theregulations. Among other changes, we are removing all references to ``DeputyAdministrator'' and replacing them with references to ``Administrator,''and removing references to ``Veterinary Services'' and replacing them withreferences to ``Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.'' We are alsoadding definitions of ``Administrator,'' ``Animal and Plant Health InspectionService,'' and ``Department.'' These terms are now used in the regulations.However, none of them are defined. The definitions we are adding are thesame definitions we use in other Parts of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.Making the nonsubstantive wording changes described in this document willhave no effect on importers, quarantine facility operators, or any otherpersons outside of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.   <ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>Determining the official responsible for decisions made under these animalimportation regulations is a matter of internal Agency management. Therefore,neither a general notice of proposed rulemaking nor a 30-day delay in effectivedate is required under 5 U.S.C. 553. Accordingly, this regulation is effectiveupon publication.   <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).   <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>These programs/activities under 9 CFR Part 94 are listed in the Catalogof Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and are subject to theprovisions of Executive Order 12372, which required intergovernmental consultationwith state and local officials.
