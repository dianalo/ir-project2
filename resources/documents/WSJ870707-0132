By 8:20, however, all 21 appointments for the day are filled. &quot;Come back tomorrow,&quot; a staff member tells disappointed latecomers.    In Cleveland, an organization working toward the same goal has its own set of woes: But this time the problem is too few illegal immigrants, not too many. Lucretia Stoica of the Nationalities Services Center has resorted to pamphleteering to encourage people to come in for amnesty advice. &quot;We've had more phone calls than anything else,&quot; Miss Stoica says. &quot;People just aren't coming forward.&quot;    Across the country, a network of social service, community and legal aid groups is struggling to help immigrants take advantage of the nation's most ambitious amnesty program ever. But the groups, beset by technical, financial and policy problems, may be unable to serve many of the millions of immigrants who are expected to apply for legal residence by the deadline next May 4.    When the immigration law was drafted, legislators incorporated church and community groups to act as a buffer between immigrants and their historical nemesis, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The government selected more than 800 agencies to serve as official Qualified Designated Entities to provide immigrants with practical and legal help. There are also scores of unofficial agencies doing the same work.    But the QDEs, as they're called, have sent few applications on to the government so far. Even groups that are overwhelmed with clients have yet to begin submitting large numbers of applications, while others report that illegal immigrants are too afraid or confused to come to them for help.    INS officials concede that applications are running at well below the expected level. About 213,000 immigrants have applied to the INS for amnesty since the program began May 5, far from the total of 3.9 million the immigration service says may eventually apply. The law allows people who have lived illegally in the U.S. continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for legal residence by next May 4.    INS officials blame the slow start on a lack of information in immigrant communities, and, increasingly, on the QDEs.    The INS expected the social service agencies to represent 80% of the applicants, with private lawyers and self-submissions acounting for about 10% each. So far, the percentages have been reversed.    &quot;We don't have the luxury of waiting around for the QDEs to gear up to handle the 80% they were supposed to handle,&quot; says William S. Slattery, the INS assistant commissioner in charge of legalization. &quot;There are about 860 QDEs nationwide,&quot; he says, adding that the rate at which their applications are coming in amounts to &quot;less than one application per QDE a day.&quot;    Immigration officials say the QDEs are overdocumenting cases, and are spending too much time processing them. Bristling at the criticism, spokesmen for the agencies say they're frustrated by what they see as a lack of cooperation from the INS.    The INS hasn't established firm guidelines on crucial policies, such as how many documents are required or what proof is necessary to qualify an immigrant as financially self-sufficient, QDE officials say. The most pressing issue, they add, is whether the unqualified spouse or children of an immigrant granted amnesty will be allowed to remain in the country.    By almost all accounts, confusion has been one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the application procedure.    &quot;At church they told me one thing, and a lawyer said something else, and the radio said something else,&quot; said a 24-year-old illegal immigrant from Zacatecas, Mexico, as he stood outside of an INS office in east Los Angeles. &quot;Who knows which is the truth, and I don't want to ask questions here,&quot; he said, gesturing to the office.    As a result of the conflicting information, some QDEs are withholding some applications until the guidelines are set, and spokesmen worry that the delays will squeeze qualified immigrants out of their chance for legalization.    &quot;If we're all running beautifully in nine months, it's almost a matter of 'So what?'&quot; says Lavinia Limon, executive director of the International Institute of Los Angeles, a nonprofit immigrant services agency that isn't officially under contract as a QDE. &quot;Three-quarters of the people will have lost the golden opportunity that Congress opened up for them.&quot;    Meanwhile, nearly all of the groups, official and unofficial, have cut their expected caseloads as much as 55%.    &quot;We estimated that we could handle about 2,500 cases, but we'll probably be able to do only about half that many,&quot; says Joe Vigil, executive director of the Immigration Counseling Center in Houston, an official QDE.    Many agencies are finding that even simple cases are taking eight to 12 hours to document and process, rather than the one to two hours projected by the INS. Complex cases can take 20 hours or more.    Agencies' expenses have risen accordingly. The agencies receive a $16 reimbursment per case from the INS, and can charge as much as $125 for their services in addition to the INS's required filing fees. But many agencies say simple cases are costing them $300 to $350 to process, rather than the $200 they had anticipated.    The Catholic Church, which runs some of the oldest and most respected social service programs in the country, has faced computer problems and other troubles. Catholic Charities of Los Angeles, the largest of the QDEs, preregistered more than 300,000 potential amnesty applicants but has submitted only a few hundred applications to the INS.    Rosa Sipler, Catholic Charities' director of legalization, says a big reason for the delay is finding and training staff members. But some immigrants, as well as other local QDE workers, say the church is having problems communicating with its clients, prompting people to go elsewhere for help.    There has been some talk about an extension of the amnesty deadline, but Mr. Slattery and other INS officials discount the need and say that people who bypass QDEs are enjoying a high acceptance rate.    &quot;The aliens are dissatisfied with the service they're getting from the QDEs, and they're coming directly to us,&quot; Mr. Slattery says. &quot;Once their friends and family see them with their new temporary cards, they'll come to us too.&quot;    But advocacy groups decry any INS attempt to circumvent the QDEs, and argue that many people will be unable to represent themselves well if legal problems arise.    &quot;At face value, some of the forms are easy to fill out,&quot; says Monsignor Nicholas DiMarizio, executive director of migration and refugee services for the United States Catholic Conference in Washington, D.C. &quot;But the implications are great, and they're dealing with a complex set of regulations.&quot;    Aware of their shortcomings, QDEs across the country are fine-tuning their programs. In Florida, Lutheran Social Services plans to open an extra office in Fort Lauderdale to fill a gap in services to the Haitian community there. In Houston, workers at Catholic Charities and other groups are putting in extra hours to accommodate a flood of applications. The groups are also calling for more education and information programs from the INS, which they hope will encourage more people to come forward soon.    In Chicago, the Latino Institute, a Hispanic advocacy group, is preparing legal challenges to INS policies it sees as too restrictive. &quot;We're also thinking of trying to collaborate with other QDEs, to see if we can push our numbers any higher,&quot; says Antonio Osegueda, the institute's coordinator of naturalization and immigration. &quot;We're going to submit just about everything we can get our hands on.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
