The company, which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors for two years, said the move will result in a charge to second-quarter earnings, but that it hasn't yet determined the size of the write-down.    The action reverses LTV's vow in April to stay in the medium and heavy military truck business. At the time, the company warned that drastic cost-cutting would be necessary to keep the division competitive. AM General, which in the last few years has lost two large and profitable government contracts to competitors, will continue to produce the Army's Hummer land vehicle and plans to bid on the Army's $1.2 billion reorder next year.    LTV said yesterday that its April commitment had been predicated on production of a total of 3,000 of the medium and heavy trucks a year. Predicted volume levels are only half that amount currently, a spokesman said. Furthermore, LTV would have to make a $20 million to $30 million investment soon to compete for a multibillion Army contract for 2.5-ton and five-ton trucks. That contract could have kept the division at capacity and profitable for some 15 years, but won't be awarded until 1990, and production isn't expected to start until 1992.    &quot;The potential reward is simply not worth the risk,&quot; an AM General spokesman said. &quot;If you did a cash-flow chart, it looked awful until way out in the future. Unacceptably awful.&quot;    When LTV unveiled its initial plan to pay off creditors in May, it said that resolving problems at AM General was one of three operational issues it would have to take care of before it could emerge from Chapter 11. In May, the company agreed to sell its steel plant in Warren, Ohio, to closely held Renco Group Inc. of New York. That leaves as the only remaining issue the more formidable hurdle of selling its loss-plagued steel bar operations.    LTV said the division will finish up a small amount of truck production for foreign customers and will withdraw its bids for two Army contracts valued at about $370 million. About 550 hourly and salaried employees at its main South Bend, Ind., plant and another 150 employees at its Ivonia, Mich., plant will be dismissed in the next several months, LTV said. The company said it expects to close the South Bend plant, which produced the trucks, early next year.    LTV doesn't break out operating profit for AM General, but it said that medium and heavy military trucks accounted for about $86 million of AM General's $297 million in sales for the first six months of 1988, and that the division was profitable.    In the year-earlier second quarter, LTV had net income of $122.7 million, or $1.03 a share, after a $57.7 million gain. </TEXT></DOC>
