Over at the St. Louis Zoo, aKing penguin is limping from a torn toenail. An elephant atWashington's National Zoo is down in the mouth with animpacted tooth. And at the San Diego Zoo, a Gila monster isfeeling as hideous as it looks, thanks to a nasty mouthinfection.   Zoo animals, like the people who come to gawk at them, getsick once in a while. The difference is that their doctorsnever charge them and sometimes they even make house calls.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I would say our health plan is as good as Blue Cross,&quot;said Dr. Robert A. Cook, chief veterinarian for the New YorkZoological Society, which encompasses the Bronx Zoo, theCentral Park Zoo and the New York Aquarium. &quot;Dental'sincluded . . . there's no deductible.&quot;   Dr. Cook's Animal Health Center, a handsome two-storybuilding on the grounds of the Bronx Zoo, is one of thebiggest zoo hospitals in the country. The health centeroversees the well-being of the society's more than 9,000animals. If a recent visit is any indication, members of thiszoological health plan receive better medical care than mostof their Bronx neighbors -- the human ones, that is.   It starts with a no-holds-barred checkup for everynewcomer. A recent morning found Dr. Cook busy arranging forthe arrival of a group of tamarin monkeys from another zoo,which would stay at the clinic for a month-long quarantineperiod.   &quot;They'll undergo TB tests, chest X-rays,electrocardiogram, CBC {complete blood count}, a biochemicalprofile, a viral screen, a physical exam-plus dental work, ifthey need it,&quot; said Dr. Cook, an easy-going fellow with acage-side manner soothing to tamarins and tapirs alike.   His day had started, like most, with the 7:30 a.m. roundsaccompanied by the center's two other veterinary clinicians.Apart from the quarantined animals -- a group of deer, somecaged sugar gliders (marsupials from Australia) and a Norwayrat bound for the zoo's Mouse House -- the clinic's patientsthat day included a diabetic monkey, an orphaned baby blackbuck (the spiral-horned Indian antelope), abedraggled-looking Shama thrush suffering from feather loss,and Whoopi, an ailing penguin from the New York Aquarium.   &quot;She had lost a lot of weight and wasn't keeping food down-- she has a fungal infection,&quot; said Dr. Cook. &quot;She's been onexperimental treatment for about two months.&quot;   Grabbing a walkie-talkie, Dr. Cook set out on a quick tourof the wards -- a series of indoor/outdoor cages, cleandespite the healthy zoo stench. Whoopi was poking around heroutdoor enclosure as a veterinary technician tried tointerest her in a fish.   &quot;I just repeated an endoscopy -- a flexible fiberopticexamination of the stomach -- on her yesterday,&quot; said Dr.Cook.   And how exactly does one go about examining the stomach ofa penguin? In the clinic's large surgery, which boasts anoperating table, electrocardiograph unit and ultrasoundmachine, Dr. Cook showed off his tool of choice.   &quot;This is used for looking at the colon of humans. We useit for looking at the stomachs of animals,&quot; he said. &quot;Most ofour equipment comes from ordinary hospitals.&quot;   The king-sized operating table with hydraulic lifts isanother matter. The veterinary team uses it for working onhefty patients such as a gorilla or zebra. Anything bigger --a camel, for instance -- can simply be laid out on thesurgery floor. And for operating on newborn birds and otherdiminutive patients, veterinarians rely on microscopes andmicrosurgical tools.   Keeping animals anesthetized during surgery requires evenmore specialized equipment. A four-foot-long endotrachealtube is used on giraffes' throats, and gas masks of allshapes and sizes line one wall, including a test-tube-sizedmask used on snakes and small birds. To put a sea lion under,Dr. Cook's team fashioned a gas mask from a plasticdisinfectant jug.   The biggest challenge zoo vets may face is getting theinvalid to the hospital. When it comes to dealing with astubborn patient -- a Siberian tiger, say -- the clinicboasts a veritable arsenal of scoped rifles, blowpipes andpole syringes -- all of which can be used to anesthetizeanimals from a safe distance. In the clinic's pharmacy, Dr.Cook pulled out a paper target.   &quot;Every once in a while I practice on the rifle range,&quot; hesaid. &quot;You have to be pretty good.&quot;   The knocked-out animals are then carried over to theclinic on stretchers or boards, where vets take advantage ofthe animal's anesthetized state to do a full physicalcheckup, do a little root canal, even clean their teeth.   Not that every animal makes it to the clinic. Say you'vegot a sick elephant. &quot;We'd go to the elephant,&quot; Dr. Cooksaid, showing off a full array of portable hospital equipment-- including an X-ray machine.   He also goes to the whales. On a recent weekday, Dr. Cookmade his house calls at the New York Aquarium -- which he ora colleague will visit twice a week, along with the CentralPark Zoo. First on the list was Nuka, a 1,500-pound walruswith an eye infection. Dr. Cook and Nuka are oldacquaintances: He had guided her through a painful tuskinfection requiring four operations in one year.   Now, a tuskless Nuka bounded up out of her pool to greether trainer, Martha Saif, a lanky blonde in T-shirt andshorts who came with bucket of fish and a bottle of eyedrops.Ms. Saif had been administering the drops several times a dayon the instructions of Dr. Cook and a veterinaryophthalmologist.   &quot;She's come a long way as far as that eye goes,&quot; Dr. Cooksaid, as Nuka snuffled up squid after patiently enduring aquick examination.   Since most of the sea mammals at the aquarium are trained,these examinations are relatively painless for doctor andpatient alike. It would be hard to imagine a better patientthan Marina, a beluga whale with a scraped eye, whoobediently pulled up at poolside and lifted her head over theedge on Ms. Saif's instruction.   &quot;She's much improved -- the area of redness has cleared upquite a bit,&quot; Dr. Cook said, as Ms. Saif put in the whale'seye ointment. After receiving several fish as a reward,Marina placidly presented her tail for Dr. Cook to take ablood sample.   &quot;That's terrific, Marina,&quot; said Ms. Saif, sounding a lotlike the parent of a child getting its finger pricked, as Dr.Cook carefully inserted a butterfly needle.   A dolphin with some minor scrapes on its tail and a sealwith a cut snout rounded out Dr. Cook's visit. Occasionally,he'll even work on fish. &quot;I did multiple surgery on a lungfish with cancer,&quot; he said modestly.   But veterinary skill and dedication notwithstanding, zoopatients do eventually go the way of all flesh. While showinga visitor out of the Animal Health Center, Dr. Cook paused toask a technician to turn on a fan.   &quot;A geriatric antelope passed away in the night,&quot; heexplained, as a sickly odor spread down the corridor from thenecropsy room, where pathologists conduct a full autopsy onevery deceased animal.   The departed are gone but not forgotten. Zoo pathologistssee to it, by preserving a piece of all the animal's organsin a large jar for future research. A back room in the clinicis a veritable library of animal organs, with jars going backas far as 20 years. In a bizarre twist, death has madeneighbors of &quot;Jackson's Hartebeest, 5-691,&quot; &quot;Hispaniolan Boa,'87&quot; and &quot;Sea Lion, 10-10-90&quot; -- all of which are grouped onneighboring shelves, a stone's throw from the bottledreproductive tract of a wisent (the nearly extinct Europeanbison).   So after spending a 12-hour day in such exotic company --living and dead -- what kind of pet does Dr. Cook go home to?A tame lion cub, perhaps, or a lama tethered in his backyard?   &quot;A parrot,&quot; he said. &quot;My wife's allergic to cats anddogs.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
