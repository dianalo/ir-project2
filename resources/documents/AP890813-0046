Researchers found depressed mothers to be less attentive totheir children and less emotionally engaged with them thannon-depressed mothers, said study co-author Donna Gelfand.   One depressed mother even failed to notice that her baby hadfallen off her own lap, said Gelfand, head of the psychologydepartment at the University of Utah.   She spoke in an interview before presenting her work Sunday atthe annual meeting of the American Psychological Association. Thestudy was done with Douglas Teti of the University of Maryland'sBaltimore County campus.   The depressed mothers did not have simply occasional periods oflow spirits that everyone feels. Instead, they had long-lastingdepression that had persisted for an average of a year when theyentered the study.   Previous studies have found that infants of such chronicallydepressed mothers are at risk for problems such as excessive cryingand other poor control over emotional behavior, Gelfand said. Inlater childhood, they may have trouble getting along with peers andteachers and lag in school achievement, she said.   It is not clear whether such problems stem from the mother'sdepression earlier in the child's life, or her depression at thetime the problems manifested themselves, or a combination of both,she said.   The study included 37 depressed mothers and 37 non-depressedmothers. The two groups were matched for socioeconomic and maritalstatus, and age of the child. The infants were three months to 12months old at the beginning of the study, which has gone on about ayear so far.   Mothers were studied in their homes by observers who had notbeen told which women were depressed, a precaution to avoid biasingtheir appraisals. The mothers were observed while they fed theirbabies, played with them and filled out a questionnaire.   In all three situations, depressed women tended to be lesssensitive to their infants' needs than the non-depressed mothers,and they failed to pick up cues from their children as well as theother mothers did, Gelfand said.   They were also less emotionally engaged with their children andless attentive, she said.   Depressed mothers were also more likely to perceive theirchildren more negatively than the non-depressed mothers viewedtheir own children. For example, they rated their children as lessintellectually capable and less rewarding, Gelfand said.   In addition, ``they see themselves as inadequate mothers'' insuch tasks as feeding, bathing, dressing and teaching, Gelfand said.   ``The depressed mothers just view parenthood as extremelydemanding, almost more demanding than they can bear,'' she said.   Researchers have started to look at the children as they reachages 1 and older, and found the offspring of depressed mothers tobe less responsive to the mother, less interested in her and lessemotionally attached. They also seemed to be generally less happy,Gelfand said.   Researchers are testing a program to prevent infants' problemsthat can result from a mother's depression. The program includesweekly visits by a nurse to stimulate the mother's interest in herbaby. Later, to counter a tendency to become housebound, depressedmothers are encouraged to become active outside the home.   Too few women have completed the program yet to provide a goodestimate of its effectiveness, Gelfand said.   Lynn Rehm, professor of psychology at the University of Houston,said the study's findings on the effects of a mother's depressiongenerally agree with previous research.</TEXT></DOC>
