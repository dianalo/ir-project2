The commission's recommendations will be sent to President Reaganon Dec. 15; he can either raise or lower the figures. Reagan'sdecision will take effect next month unless Congress blocks theaction.   The panel, known as the Commission on Executive, Legislative andJudicial Salaries, meets after every presidential election torecommend salary level of top officials.   A draft report being considered by the panel recommends a payincrease, although it does not contain any figures. But it says theraise should be granted only in conjunction with a ban on outsideincome, known as honoaria.   Members of Congress, who are now paid $89,500, can receivehonoraria for speeches and articles. The panel endorsed an honorariaban for the top 2,498 federal officials, including Cabinet membersand judges.   Cabinet members are now paid $99,500, while most judges receive$89,500. During two days of hearings last month, the commissionheard testimony that a number of federal judges have resigned andreturned to practicing law because lawyers receive much greater pay.   Two years ago, another commission recommended that congressionalpay be raised to $135,000 a year, Cabinet members be paid $160,000,and most judges be paid $130,000. But Reagan reduced therecommendations to the current pay levels.   The draft report also endorsed a pay raise for the president, whohas received $200,000 annually since 1969. But it sets no figure.   Lloyd Cutler, chairman of the panel, and other members havepublicly endorsed the need for higher pay, saying that inflation hasfar outstripped pay rates, making it hard for the government toattract top talent.   On the average, federal salaries will now only buy 65 percent ofwhat they would in 1969, the draft report notes, but salaries earnedby average non-federal workers will buy about 1.5 percent more than1969.   ``In other words,'' the report noted, ``high-level governmentofficials have seen the purchasing power of their salaries eroded bymore than one-third while other wage earners have on average atleast maintained their purchasing power.''   ``No statistic could more clearly demonstrate how high-levelpublic service today imposes a financial penalty on those in publicservice and their families, notwithstanding the privilege andsatisfaction of answering the nation's call,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
