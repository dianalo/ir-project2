Japanese officials, miffed that the U.S. hasn't clearedcargo service by Japan Airlines and Nippon Cargo Airlinesbetween the two cities, have given United only temporarypermission to fly the route. But UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolfsaid he was certain the dispute will be resolved &quot;within thenext couple of days,&quot; granting United permanent approval ofits new service.</LP><TEXT>   Before boarding a Boeing 747-400 aircraft scheduled toland today in Tokyo, Mr. Wolf made his way through an O'HareInternational Airport terminal filled with Japanese dancers,lanterns, and food to celebrate the new route.   United's request has become a playing card in a complexdispute centering on landing and departure slots at thecrowded New Tokyo International Airport in Narita, Japan, andat O'Hare. The Japanese government says it will halt the newUnited flights next week if the U.S. continues to hold upcargo service by the two Japanese carriers. The skirmishcomes a year after the U.S. and Japan signed a broad pact toexpand service in the lucrative trans-Pacific market.   The current maneuvering began late last year, after UnitedParcel Service of the U.S. complained about the Tokyo slotsallocated to its planned new cargo service. UPS demandedslots for six evenings a week, so it could collect goods inTokyo during the day and whisk them out overnight. Japaneseauthorities initially granted slots for two evenings and fourother days, and eventually agreed to provide five evenings --but said Tuesday evenings were impossible because therearen't any available slots.   In response, U.S. transportation authorities delayedpermission for Japan Airlines and Nippon Cargo to begin theirChicago services, which had been expected to start lastOctober.   In talks during the past few days, Japan has offered tolet United go ahead with its Chicago flight if the U.S.allows the Japanese companies to start at least some of theirplanned cargo flights, according to sources in bothgovernments.   But U.S. negotiators are insisting that any solution alsoinclude favorable time slots for a new Delta Airlines flightbetween Los Angeles and Tokyo and an American Airlines flightbetween San Jose, Calif., and Tokyo. Both of those companiesare dissatisfied with their slots, according to the sources.   Both sides say they don't expect the dogfight over Tokyoto affect flights to other Japanese cities covered under the1989 pact.   The incident marks the latest in a long series ofsometimes rancorous disputes over air rights, dating back tothe 1952 treaty that still provides the basic framework forbilateral civil aviation. While the U.S. competitive edge mayhave eroded in many areas, Japanese authorities have longcomplained that the treaty has endowed the U.S. with anenduring advantage in air transportation.</TEXT></DOC>
