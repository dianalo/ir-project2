(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Herbert Hoover didn't get elected thisway, but with his engineer's mind he might have liked thegroundbreaking use of computers for a campus vote today at his almamater.   State and county officials are watching the vote at StanfordUniversity _ where the nation's 31st president was elected theschool's first student body treasurer 95 years ago _ as a test ofwhether computers terminals replacing paper ballots can attractvoters, prevent fraud and keep out hackers.   If turnout is as high as expected, the election will be thebiggest ever taken by computer terminal in the United States.   The election, using about 70 university-owned or rented AppleMacintosh computers and software written by a sophomore, isexpected to cost at least $3,000 less than the $13,000 spent lastyear.   The votes are expected to counted within two hours after thepolls close Wednesday night, instead of the five days it took lastyear.   ``We're observing the Stanford election as an interestingexperiment,'' said John Mott-Smith, coordinator of voter outreachfor the California secretary of state.   Among the questions Mott-Smith and county officials have are how``user friendly'' and how secure the system is, compared with paperballots that always can be examined and recounted.   ``The bottom line is the people have to have confidence that thesystem is accurate,'' Mott-Smith said.   The Stanford program developed by Sandy Aronson requires the13,000 students eligible to vote to punch in their names and schoolID numbers to prevent them from voting more than once.   ``If the computer detects that it's being tampered with in somemanner, it will make a lot of loud noises and alert the pollwatcher,'' said Steven Krauss, elections commissioner and asophomore.   Other schools using computerized elections have had minorproblems amid overall encouraging results, those involved say. AtBoston University last week, a disk failure caused 248 of the 3,159votes cast to go uncounted.   At Stanford, about 5,000 students generally vote, Krauss said.Nearly 100 candidates are running for various offices.   Paper ballots will be used by students at Stanford's threeoverseas campuses and by those who refuse to use the computers.   ``There will probably always be people on campus who don't knowhow to use a Mac and are dreadfully afraid of using the machine,''Krauss said.</TEXT></DOC>
