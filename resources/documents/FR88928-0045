It was first collected in 1922 by John K. Smallin Highlands County, Florida, and was collected in the same year by Mrs.F.E. Ohlinger southeast of Frostproof, Polk County. S.F. Black (1923) placedthe plant in the blazing star genus, naming it <T3>Lacinaria ohlingerae, </T3>with the Frostproof site as the type locality.Small (1924) created a new genus for this plant, which became <T3>Ammopursus ohlingerae.</T3> Robinson (1934) reinstated scrub blazingstar in the large genus of the blazing stars in <T3>Liatris ohlingerae,</T3> changing the name of the genus in keepingwith adoption of <T3>Liatris</T3> as a conserved name under the International Code of BotanicalNomenclature. Gaiser's (1946) treatment of <T3>Liatris</T3> and Cronquist's (1980) floristic treatment of the asterfamily in the Southeast retain this plant in the genus <T3>Liatris,</T3> although Lakela (1964) argued in favor of reinstating<T3>Ammopursus</T3> as a genus of only one species. Cronquist gives threecommon names for <T3>Liatris</T3>: blazing star, gay feather, and button snakeroot. Membersof the genus that are sold as cut flowers or as garden perennials are usuallycalled blazing stars. Wunderlin et al. (1980) mention ``sand torch'' asa name for <T3>Liatris ohlingerae.</T3><T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is an erect, usually unbranched perennial herb,up to 1 meter (3 feet) tall. The leaves are very narrow, only 1-2.5 millimeters(0.04-0.10 inches) wide. The several flower heads are usually separatedfrom each other on the stem; they are large compared to the rest of thegenus, up to 2 centimeters (0.8 inch) broad and 3 centimeters (1.2 inch)from base to tips of the flowers. The flowers are bright pinkish purple.The plant flowers from July through September and October (Kral 1983, Cronquist1980). <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>has been collected frequently because of itsbrilliant flowers. A study of the central Florida sand pine scrub by Christman(1988) shows 93 known localities for the plant (71 of them in HighlandsCounty), with a geographic range from Auburndale and Hesperides (on highway60 east of Lake Wales) in Polk County, south along the Lake Wales Ridge(and U.S. highway 27) through Sebring to the Archbold Biological Stationin Highlands County. The distribution of <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>overlaps or encompasses the distribution of10 federally listed plants of the scrub habitat, and it parallels especiallyclosely the distributions of <T3>Hypericum cumulicola </T3>(endangered), <T3>Polygonella basiramia</T3> (endangered), and <T3>Prunus geniculata</T3> (endangered). A site at Archbold BiologicalStation is protected; a site at Saddle Blanket Lakes has been proposedfor purchase by the State, but the purchase is not yet funded. A smallsite may be added to Highlands Hammock State Park. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is restricted to sand pine scrub vegetation,a vegetation that is restricted to Florida and has its greatest floristicrichness on the Lake Wales Ridge. Scrub vegetation occurs on excessivelydrained, sand soils, usually on sites that, under presettlement conditions,were provided a degree of natural fire protection by a nearby lake or swamp(S. Christman, botany seminar, University of Florida, Feb. 1988). Scrubvegetation is dominated by evergreen shrubs including oaks (such as theendemic <T3>Quercus inopina</T3>), with variable numbers of sand pine (<T3>Pinus clausa</T3>). Sandy open spaces between large shrubs are occupiedby small shrubs such as <T3>Conradina brevifolia </T3>and <T3>Dicerandra frutescens </T3>(both members of the mint family, the latterfederally listed as endangered), <T3>Polygonella myriophylla </T3>(of the buckwheat family), and numeroussmall herbs including <T3>Bonamia grandiflora </T3>(of the morning glory family, threatened),<T3>Nolina brittoniana </T3>(agave family), and a few grasses such as <T3>Schizachyrium niveum </T3>(a bluestem grass endemic to central Florida).Christman (1988) list 39 plant taxa that are virtually restricted to scrubvegetation. Of these taxa, 33 are present on the Lake Wales Ridge. Scrubvegetation on the Ridge appears to have the greatest number of endemicplant species in any single habitat in Florida. The State's two other majorregions of plant endemism are the Apalachicola lowlands in northwest Florida(with about the same number of taxa, in several habitats) and the tropicalregion of Dade and Monroe Counties (with more taxa, but with few of thetaxa constituting full species). Florida has the greatest degree of plantendemism in eastern North America (Florida Natural Areas Inventory, inpress).<T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>was first collected by Ray Garrett in 1948 onsand dunes near Sebring; a second specimen was collected by Leonard J.Brass in the company of Garrett, presumably from the same locality. Garrettconsulted with Erdman West and Lilian Arnold at the University of Florida,but neigher could identify the plant. West had an illustration prepared.Over the years, attempts were made to identify the shrub (which belongsto the family Rhamnaceae or buckthorns) and to relocate the shrub in thewild, with no success. Finally, Walter Judd noted the similarity of Garrett'sspecimen to several shrubs from the southwestern United States and Mexico.Judd and Hall (1984) proposed that Garrett's specimen represented a newspecies, which they named <T3>Ziziphus celata, </T3>most closely related to <T3>Ziziphus obtusifolia </T3>(lotebush, white crucillo or gray thorn;a variable species of the deserts of southern California, Arizona, NewMexico, Texas, and Mexico) and to <T3>Ziziphus parryi </T3>(California lotebush, of southern California andBaja California) (Benson and Darrow 1981). Subsequently, Brass' specimenwas found at the herbarium of the Archbold Biological Station, and theillustration prepared under West's direction was found (Wunderlin et al.1985). In late July 1987, Kris R. DeLaney found a population of the Floridaziziphus in Polk County, Florida, after carefully searching suitable habitats(Wunderlin et al. 1987).<T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>is a shrub up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) high. Branchesare zigzagged and bear short, straight, spiny branchlets. Leaves are alternate,deciduous, with blades that are oblong-elliptic to obovate, dark glossygreen above, lighter dull green beneath, 4.5-21 millimeters (0.18-0.83inch) long, and 3-13 millimeters (0-12-0.5 inches) wide. Leaves have roundedtips, cuneate bases, and entire margins (Wunderlin et al. 1987). Flowersare axillary and solitary but appear fascicled; sepals are 5, green; petalsare 5, white, somewhat clasping the stamens; stamens 5. The floral discis thickened and surrounds the ovary (Judd and Hall 1984). The fruit isa drupe (Wunderlin et al. 1985). <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>may be recognized in the field by its small, dark,glossy green, entire leaves on conspicuously zigzag spiny branches. Largerspecimens tend to be covered with lichens (Wunderlin et al. 1987).Currently, only one population of <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>is known, consisting of about 30 stems in 2 groupson approximately 2 acres on the Lake Wales Ridge in Polk County. Despiteintensive floristic surveys of the Lake Wales Ridge in recent years, noother populations have been found. The site is on Avon Park Fine Sand,an excessively drained deep sand soil. The site appears to represent atransition between sand pine scrub vegetation and longleaf pine (<T3>Pinus palustris</T3>) vegetation with turkey oak (<T3>Quercus laevis</T3>). The site has evergreen oaks, scrub hickory (<T3>Carya floridana</T3>), <T3>Bumelia tenax </T3>(a buckthorn), <T3>Prunus geniculata </T3>(scrub plum, endangered), and many herbs, including<T3>Berlandiera subacaulis </T3>(a yellow daisy), <T3>Bonamia grandiflora </T3>(Florida bonamia, threatened), <T3>Bulbostylis </T3>sp. (a small sedge), <T3>Liatris ohlingerae, Licania michauxii </T3>(gopher apple), <T3>Paronychia chartacea (</T3>papery whitlow wort, threatened), and <T3>Warea carteri </T3>(Carter's mustard, endangered) (Wunderlin et al.1987).Federal government action on <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>began with section 12 of the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presentedto the Congress on January 9, 1975. In this report, <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>was considered endangered. On July 1, 1975,the Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the reportas a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3))of the Act, and of its intention thereby to review the status of the planttaxa contained within. On December 14, 1980, the Service published a noticeof review for plants (45 FR 82480), which included <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>as a Category 1 candidate (a taxon for whichdata in the Service's possession indicate listing is warranted). A noticeof review published on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), maintained thisspecies as a Category 1 candidate. The proposal to list this species asendangered is based on the information available in 1980, augmented byfield work conducted since then by Gary Schultz for the Florida NaturalAreas Inventory and by Steven Christman (1988) and by recent informationon the rate of development of the two counties.In the September 27, 1985, notice of review, <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>is designated a Category 2* candidate (a taxonfor which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possiblyappropriate but for which additional biological information is needed tosupport a proposed rule; the asterisk indicates that the taxon is possiblyextinct). Subsequent discovery of another herbarium specimen, an illustrationof a fruit, and an extant population of <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>have confirmed that this is a valid species thatmerits listing.Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretaryto make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of theirreceipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 Amendments further requires that allpetitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newlysubmitted on that date. This was the case for <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>because the Service had accepted the 1975 Smithsonianreport as a petition. In October of 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987, theService found the petitioned listing of this species was warranted butprecluded by other listing actions of a higher priority, and that additionaldata on vulnerability and threats were still being gathered. Publicationof the present proposal constitutes the final 1-year finding that is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and regulations (50CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Actset forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A speciesmay be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to oneor more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factorsand their applications to <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>(S.F. Blake) Robinson and <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>Judd andamp; Hall are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof Their Habitat or Range<T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is restricted to sand pine scrub vegetationon the Lake Wales Ridge and the nearby Auburndale area in Highlands andPolk Counties, Florida. Sand pine scrub vegetation occurs elsewhere inthese counties and the rest of the State, but lacks <T3>Liatris ohlingerae. </T3>The Lake Wales Ridge is a major citrus producingarea, and the towns along the Ridge are growing rapidly. In Highlands County,64.2 percent of the xeric vegetation (scrub, scrubby flatwoods, and longleafpine-turkey oak vegetation) present before settlement had been destroyedin 1981. An additional 10.3 percent of the xeric vegetation was moderatelydisturbed, primarily by building roads to create housing subdivisions (Peroniand Abrahamson 1985). Remaining tracts of scrub on the Lake Wales Ridgein Polk and Highlands counties are rapidly being developed for citrus groves,and especially for housing developments and businesses (Fred Lohrer, ArchboldBiological Station, pers. comm. 1985; James Duane, Executive Director,Central Florida Regional Planning Council, pers. comm. 1988).Many of the remaining stands of scrub are vacant lots, patches of landisolated by railroad tracks, or other isolated fragments of the originalvegetation. Some of the few remaining large areas of scrub are subdivisionshere lots were sold to absentee owners, but houses were not built. Thefragmented land ownership, the difficulty of contacting landowners, andinformal use of such subdivisions as trash dumps and recreation areas makeconservation of the vegetation difficult. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is not known to occur in publicly owned sandpine scrub vegetation at Arbuckle Lake or the Avon Park Air Force Rangedin these counties. The plant does not occur within (or on land that maybe added to) Highlands Hammock State Park in Highlands County, and it occurson the private Archbold Biological Station. <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>occurs at Saddle Blanlet Lakes, a tract inPolk County that is on the acquisition list for the State of Florida'sConservation and Recreation Lands Program. So far, purchase of this tracthas been delayed because other tracts have received higher priority. TheNature Conservancy owns a small preserve at Saddle Blanket Lakes.The relatively large number of known localities for <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is misleading. Because it has conspicuous flowersand is easily identified, it has been collected very frequently, much like<T3>Polygonella myriophylla, </T3>a distinctive species of the same habitat.Many of the known sites for the blazing star have already been destroyed,although on exact count is available. Although the blazing star is stilllocally abundant, most of the extant sites are small, and sites are disappearingvery rapidly. For example, in January of 1988, Steven Christman (pers.comm. 1988) prepared for The Nature Conservancy a list of 10 sites that,collectively, could constitute a network of preserves for the central Floridascrub flora; by late March, 3 of the sites had changed hands, including1 that had been considered relatively secure.<T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>was first collected near Sebring; the site hasnot been relocated and may have been destroyed. The single known existingpopulation, in Polk County, consists of about 30 stems. Most or all ofthe stems may be from a single rootstock. The site is privately owned,and it is not protected (Wunderlin et al. 1987; R. Wunderlin, pers. comm.1988). DeLaney and Wunderlin have received funding from the Florida NongameWildlife Program to search for more populations, but the lack of collectionsfrom this intensively explored portion of the State indicates that fewpopulations can be expected to be found.B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes<T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is being tested by a Dutch firm for cultivationas a cut flower because of its exceptionally large flower heads that aremore pinkish than those of other members of the genus (S. Wallace, BokTower Gardens, pers. comm. 1988). This activity does not pose a threatto the species, but the increasing popularity of members of the genus <T3>Liatris </T3>as garden perennials could threaten this species in thefuture.<T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>is one of the rarest shrubs in North America.Unrestricted scientific collecting or excessive visits could seriouslyaffect the one population.C. Disease or PredationNot applicable.D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is listed as endangered by the Preservationof Native Flora of Florida Act (Section 581.185-187, Florida Statutes),which regulates taking, transport, and sale of plants but does not providehabitat protection. <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>is proposed for addition to the State list. TheEndangered Species Act will offer additional protection through section7 and recovery planning. <ITAG tagnum="84">E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence</ITAG>Restriction to specialized habitats and to small geographic ranges tendsto intensify any adverse effects on any rare plant. This is the case for<T3>Liatris ohlingerae, </T3>and is exacerbated by the loss of habitatthat has already taken place. <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>may be threatened by loss of genetic variationbecause the existing population may consist of only one or two clones.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Liatris ohlingerae, </T3>and <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>as endangered. Their limited remaining habitatsand vulnerability to human activities indicate that both species are indanger of extinction throughout all or significant portions of their ranges,and therefore fit the Act's definition of endangered. The decision notto propose critical habitat for these species is discussed in the followingsection.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat  </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a speciesthat is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for <T3>Liatris ohlingerae, </T3>or <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>at this time. Federal agencies can be alertedto the presence of these species without the publication of critical habitatdescriptions and maps. Publication of critical habitat descriptions andmaps would increase the degree of threat from taking or vandalism, because<T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>is an attractive plant that could become popularin home gardens and because live speciments of <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>would be of interest to a limited number of hobbyistsand institutions; it could be a commercially viable plant for a few specializednurseries. Removal of attractive plants, or plant curiosities, from thewild by collectors and hobbyists has been a serious problem for many yearsin south Florida. Consequently, no critical habitat is proposed for theseplant species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may adverselyaffect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The currentlyknown sites for <T3>Liatris ohlingerae, </T3>are on private land, except for one that mybe purchased by the State. The one currently known site for <T3>Ziziphus celata </T3>is on private land. The State of Florida is awareof the need to conserve both species; no Federal involvement is known atHighlands Hammock State Park or on private lands in the area. Populationsof <T3>Liatris ohlingerae, </T3>that extend onto State-owned highway rights-of-waymay be subject to Federal involvement if the U.S. Department of Transportation(Federal Highway Administration) should provide funds for maintenance orconstruction. Federal mortgage programs may be subject to section 7 review,including those of U.S. Department of Agriculture (farmers Home Administration),Veterans Administration, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development(Federal Housing Administration loans). The supply of electricity to newhousing developments may be subject to Federal involvement through theRural Electrification Administration.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export any endangered plant, transport itin interstate or foreign commerce, or remove it from areas under Federaljurisdiction and reduce it to possession. Certain exceptions can applyto agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry outotherwise prohibited activities involving endangered species under certaincircumstances. There is no commercial trade in <T3>Ziziphus celata, </T3>and no known commercial trade within the UnitedStates in <T3>Liatris ohlingerae. </T3>The Service anticipate few, if any, requestsfor permits. Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiriesregarding them may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington,DC 20038-7329 (202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final rule resulting from this proposal willbe accurate and as effective as possible in the conservation of endangeredor threatened species. Therefore, any comments or suggestions from thepublic, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community,industry, or any other interested party concerning any aspect of this proposalare hereby solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning the following:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Liatris ohlingerae </T3>and <T3>Ziziphus celata; </T3>(2) The location of any additional populations of these species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thesespecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the range and habitat of these speciesand their possible impacts on them.Final promulgation of the regulation on these species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 3100 University Boulevard South,Suite 120, Jacksonville, Florida 32216.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Benson, L., and R.A.
