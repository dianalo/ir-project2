(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A teen-ager known as ``Iron Man'' wascharged with four slayings in his neighborhood after he madeincriminating statements that clinched his connection to the crimes,police said.   Craig E. Price, 15, was arraigned Monday at Family Court underheavy security because of death threats. Under state law he cannotbe charged as an adult and if found delinquent faces no more thansix years in juvenile prison.   The 240-pound, 5-foot-10 Price was described by friends andneighbors as a popular, rambunctious youth more inclined to footballthan studies.   He was arrested Sunday at his home, a block from the house wherehe allegedly beat and stabbed to death a woman and her two daughtersduring Labor Day weekend, and two doors from the house of a womanstabbed to death in 1987.   A search of Price's house produced evidence including a weaponthat may have been used killings, Police Chief Wesley Blanchardsaid. He declined to describe the items.   ``We have physical evidence to tie in every step along the way,''Blanchard said, although he indicated Price's self-incriminatingstatements were the primary evidence in the 1987 case.   Judge Carmen DiPetrillo ordered Price held at the state TrainingSchool. He scheduled a hearing Thursday for prosecutors to detailevidence.   About 30 people gathered outside the courthouse, including someof Price's friends who claimed he could not have killed anyone.   Sheriff Antonio Giorgio said all 22 officers on his force in thistown of about 90,000 people were called in because ``you getdisgruntled neighbors, angry neighbors and you have to protectagainst something happening.''   Price is charged with three counts of deliquency first-degreemurder and one count of burglary in the deaths of Joan Heaton, 39,and her daughters, Jennifer, 10, and Melissa, 8, who were found intheir home Sept. 4.   He is charged with one count of deliquency first-degree murderand one count of deliquency burglary in the 1987 stabbing of RebeccaA. Spencer, 27.   If found delinquent, Price could be held at the juvenile prisononly until age 21, said state Attorney General James E. O'Neil.   Price was a suspect in the Heaton killings ``right from thestart'' because of a cut on his hand and his conflicting statementsabout it, said Blanchard.   ``If you wish to call it a confession you can refer to it as that_ but he gave a statement to the investigating detectives whichwould very strongly implicate himself and no others in bothhomicides,'' Blanchard said.   Blanchard, however, said the motive is uncertain.   An autopsy revealed the three victims had bruises and numerousbroken bones, apparently from a struggle with their killer, leadingpolice to speculate the killer might have been cut or injured.   Scott Putnam, 18, a friend of Price's who waited outside thecourthouse, said he lived with the Prices until a few days ago andPrice showed him a cut left index finger when Putnam returned homeat about 1 a.m. Sept. 2.   ``You could see the bone on one side. It was deep,'' Putnam said.Price told him he had punched out a car window, Putnam said.   Police have said an intruder broke into the Heaton home through arear window.   Price, who played varsity football last year, was ineligible toplay this year because he had been held back in the ninth grade. Hismother, father and older brother attended the hearing but had nocomment.   Price's lawyer, public defender Robert E. Marro, declined tocomment.</TEXT></DOC>
