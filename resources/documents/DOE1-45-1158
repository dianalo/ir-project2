<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-1158 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report presents an Air Toxic Pollutant Crosswalk that associatesemitting-source categories with specific air-toxics compounds. This isa qualitative association and does not provide any information aboutthe quantities of pollutants emitted from the source categories. Thecrosswalk contains pollutant names, CAS numbers, industrial source categories(SIC codes), and emitting source classifications (SCC codes). AppendicesC-G of the EPA report, Compiling Air Toxics Emissions Inventory, EPA-450/4-86-010,were updated and expanded to develop the report. In addition, a softwaresystem containing the crosswalk was developed for easy access and updatingof the data. Use of the system is explained in the EPA report, ToxicAir Pollutant/Source Crosswalk - Information Storage and Retrieval SystemUser's Manual, EPA-450/4-87-023b. EPA is making available the systemand data-base records to agency users upon request. The purpose of thereport is to offer a technical service to air pollution control agenciesin performing preliminary assessments of the types and sources of toxiccompounds present in an area. The crosswalk helps agencies to identifythe potential of pollutants to be emitted from sources in an area.</TEXT></DOC>
