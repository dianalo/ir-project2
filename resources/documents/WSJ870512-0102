SeibStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House Ways and Means Committee voted to raise the federal borrowing limit by $20 billion to allow the government to continue to function and issue debt through July 17.    The extension is expected to be approved by the House tomorrow and sent to the Senate. Action by the Senate might not come until next week, however, according to Senate Democratic aides.    The debt limit, currently $2.3 trillion, under existing law drops to $2.111 trillion after Friday.    Also tomorrow, the committee plans to bring to the floor an alternate measure that would raise the debt limit to nearly $2.6 trillion, enough to take the government through the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, 1988. But disputes between Democrats and Republicans make approval of that proposal unlikely.    Speaker Jim Wright (D., Texas) said he won't urge fellow Democrats, who have a majority in the House, to support the longer extension until the Republicans produce a majority of their members for the measure.    Despite the urging of President Reagan and GOP leaders in Congress, proponents of a longer extension apparently haven't been able to line up a majority of House Republicans.    Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), the Ways and Means Committee chairman, said the White House was working hard to secure enough votes for an amendment-free debt-ceiling extension in the Senate. But he added: &quot;I've heard that song played before.&quot;    Yesterday, President Reagan met with several House Republicans to ask for support for the debt-ceiling increase, which each year has proved to be a difficult and contentious vote in Congress, especially in the Senate.    After the meeting at the White House, Rep. John Duncan (R., Tenn.) said he thought President Reagan would &quot;support anything he can get.&quot; He acknowledged that some of the GOP House members who met with the president won't support an amendment-free debt-ceiling bill unless they get assurances that the Senate will go along. But Rep. Duncan didn't say whether President Reagan had managed to win the support of any recalcitrant Republicans.    The White House estimated yesterday that, if Congress failed to act, the government would begin defaulting on its debts May 28. Current estimates indicate that after midnight Friday, the government's debt outstanding subject to the ceiling will be about $160 billion above the permanent $2.111 trillion lid.    Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the administration wants the ceiling raised to $2.8 trillion, the amount needed to get through May 1989, or &quot;at the very least&quot; to $2.5 trillion, the amount needed to carry the government through fiscal 1988.    Though they may have little choice but to accept it now, White House aides aren't enthusiastic about a temporary debt-ceiling extension like the one cleared by the House committee yesterday.    Against this backdrop, top White House officials are discussing ways to overhaul the federal budget process. Before they talk about compromise on the budget, they want a way to guarantee that Congress will stick to its budget resolution when the time comes for appropriating the money.    White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker met yesterday with Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, to discuss the debt limit issue and the administration's broader demand for &quot;budget reform.&quot; Senior White House officials insist that they don't want to tie the two issues together.    A top aide acknowledges that sooner or later the White House will have to sit down with Congress to discuss the budget, but he insisted that the administration first wants to deal with the budget process. </TEXT></DOC>
