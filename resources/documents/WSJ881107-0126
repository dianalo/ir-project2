Michael Walter, a partner with KIO lawyers Stephenson Harwood, said the KIO considers five years to be &quot;the sort of period that will enable us to divest to the level required with the least possibility of creating a disorderly market.&quot; Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission has suggested a 12-month divestment period, but has indicated flexibility might be required. The British government ordered the reduction in KIO's stake last month. </TEXT></DOC>
