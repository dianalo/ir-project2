Ivan Katorgin, head of the Interior Ministry's Department ofCorrectional Facilities, said there was a 28.8 percent increase incrimes committed at correctional institutions and detention centers.   ``This year, there were 48 cases of hostage-taking, which isthree times more than the whole of 1988,'' Katorgin wrote inNedelya, a weekly supplement to the government newspaper Izvestia.``A total of 114 guards were subjected to physical violence, with14 wounded and one killed.''   He said that over the first five months of 1989, 263 inmatesfaced disciplinary or criminal charges and that there was a growingtendency toward group disobedience and refusal to work.   The Interior Ministry is taking several steps to reverse theviolent trend, such as allowing inmates to use 10 percent of theirpay to buy food in prison shops and increasing the number of visitsby relatives.   Katorgin also said corrupt prison officials will be fired.</TEXT></DOC>
