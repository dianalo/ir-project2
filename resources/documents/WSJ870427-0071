As a result, Texaco's battle for survival has finally been reduced to economic issues in a bankruptcy court and to matters of legal theory in the appeals courts.    In a perfunctory ruling Friday, a Texas appeals court -- the last court with the power to evaluate the &quot;factual sufficiency&quot; of Pennzoil's mammoth judgment -- denied two motions by Texaco to reopen major issues in the case. The rulings brought to nine the number of consecutive adverse rulings that Texaco has received in its efforts to reverse the 1985 judgment in favor of Houston-based Pennzoil.    Texaco will continue, however, to fight the judgment on two fronts. On Friday, it announced that it would immediately seek an appeal of the judgment before the Texas Supreme Court. And today, in a U.S. bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y., Texaco faces its first major test in the Chapter 11 proceedings into which it moved to protect itself from insolvency in the face of the Pennzoil judgment. Texaco is based in White Plains.    Today's bankruptcy-court hearing follows a week of behind-the-scenes politicking in which Pennzoil has been seeking a major voice in the case and Texaco has been seeking to restrain Pennzoil's role. A court trustee controls appointments to a committee of unsecured creditors that will assume a major role in reorganization proceedings. But the major creditors themselves will choose a committee chairman.    Last week, lawyers for the two giant oil concerns held informal meetings on the subject with other major creditors. Pennzoil lawyers tried to assure creditors that Pennzoil won't seek any undue advantage from the magnitude of its $10.3 billion claim, which swamps the next largest claim by a factor of 40 times. Texaco lawyers, meanwhile, urged creditors to be wary of permitting Pennzoil a major voice in the case.    For Pennzoil to serve as chairman of the unsecured creditors' committee, for instance, would be &quot;counterproductive,&quot; a Texaco lawyer said. A Pennzoil attorney complained that &quot;Texaco has tried to plant the adversarial seed&quot; between Pennzoil and other creditors. Other major creditors include Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Chase Manhattan Bank, all in their capacities as trustees for various classes of Texaco debt securities.    Should the creditors refuse to satisfy Pennzoil's wishes for a major role in the case, Pennzoil will seek to establish an independent voice, Pennzoil lawyers said. Pennzoil could, for instance, launch its own effort to probe Texaco's financial and operating condition through the use of depositions and subpoenas, the Pennzoil lawyers claimed.    While the bankruptcy-court proceedings drag on, Texaco will continue its appeal of the underlying court judgment that Pennzoil won in 1985, when a jury found that Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil Co. had interfered with a binding merger agreement between Pennzoil and Getty.    Rulings issued Friday by a Texas appeals court continued Texaco's unbroken series of defeats in its effort to reverse the judgment. Texaco previously had asked the appeals court to reconsider its decision of Feb. 12 to affirm nearly all of Pennzoil's judgment; in its latest request, Texaco argued that the appeals court opinion affirming the judgment was riddled with 200 contradictions, logical fallacies, misstatements of law and other errors. Texaco even claimed that the procedures used by the appeals court had unfairly favored Pennzoil.    Texaco had separately asked the appeals court to consider &quot;new evidence&quot; in the case -- a series of letters between the trial judge, the late Anthony J.P. Farris, and a third party, which, according to Texaco, showed that Judge Farris had a personal vendetta against Texaco while he presided over the jury trial.    In one-sentence rulings, the appeals court refused to reconsider its ruling and to admit the additional evidence.    &quot;This action, without any explanation, represents more of the same failure by the Texas lower courts to come to grips with the legal issues involved in this case,&quot; James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.    Friday's rulings paved the way for Texaco to appeal the judgment to the Texas Supreme Court, which is under no obligation to hear the case. Although the state high court agrees to review only between 10% and 15% of the cases brought before it, Texas lawyers generally believe that the court will agree to hear Texaco's appeal.    Texaco closed Friday at $31.25, off 25 cents, and Pennzoil at $75.875, up $1.875, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
