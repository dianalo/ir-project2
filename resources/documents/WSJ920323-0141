For years, beef fat and cocoa butter have been ranked withdairy butter among the dietary no-nos for people whose bloodcholesterol levels render them prone to coronary heartdisease. The fats are high in saturated fatty acids, whichtend to raise blood cholesterol levels.   Four years ago, however, nutrition scientists at theUniversity of Texas in Dallas fed volunteers syntheticversions of fatty acids and found that one, stearic acid,doesn't raise cholesterol levels. They suggested stearic acidcould be used to make a more buttery margarine thatcholesterol-conscious consumers could use without guilt.   Now a follow-up experiment with natural fats bolsters theearlier finding with the synthetic fats. Texas researchersMargo A. Denke and Scott M. Grundy got 10 middle-aged menwith cholesterol problems to go on a liquid diet in which 40%of the calories came from fats, typical of the American diet.The men tested four diets, each with a different natural fat.   The men's average cholesterol levels were highest whentheir diet was based on butterfat, which is high in totalsaturated fat (25% of calories) but low in stearic acid (4%of calories). With beef tallow, which is lower in totalsaturated fat (19%) but richer in stearic acid (7.6%), theaverage cholesterol levels were slightly lower than withbutterfat. Cholesterol levels were even lower when the menate a diet built around cocoa butter, which is the richest ofthe four fats in stearic acid (13%). The lowest cholesterollevels occurred when the fat was olive oil, which isextremely low in all saturated fatty acids, including stearicacid.   Because saturated fats rich in stearic acid have lesseffect on blood cholesterol levels, it's all right forcholesterol watchers to enjoy lean red meat, but not fattymeat, and an occasional chocolate treat, the researchersconclude.                                                                                                          Sapphire Fibers Monitor   Engine Heat and Strains                                                                                                          Threads of sapphire may be buried in tomorrow's auto andjet engines.   Man-made sapphire fibers about the thickness of a humanhair are already used to reinforce metal and glass parts. Theglass plate over the machine that reads bar codes at thesupermarket checkout counter is reinforced with the nearlyinvisible sapphire fibers, for instance.   Recently, engineers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute inBlacksburg developed a way to use the sapphire fibers tomonitor temperatures, pressures and strains in superhotenvironments such as jet engines, power plants and cermicengines that might power autos of the future. The fibers canwithstand temperatures of as much as 2,000 degrees Celsius,more than twice the temperature at which conventional opticalfibers would melt, say Kent Murphy and Richard Claus ofVirginia Tech's Fiber and Electro-Optics Research Center.   The pair has patented sensors in which laser beams arepiped through the sapphire fibers. The sensors measure minutechanges in the light waves caused by shifts in temperaturesand pressures, and by strains in surrounding materials.   In a jet engine, the sapphire sensors, by detectingchanges in sound-wave pressures, could warn the pilot thatthe engine is on the verge of shutting down, Mr. Murphy says.In an auto engine, feed-back from the sensors couldautomatically change the fuel mixture to keep the engineoperating at its most efficient temperature and pressure, hesuggests.                                                                                                          Boric Acid Holds Promise   As a Cheap Lubricant                                                                                                          Tough but cheap machine lubricants may be sitting in themedicine cabinet.   The lubricants would be made of boric acid, long usedaround the house as an antiseptic and cockroach killer, andby industry for making cement and glass, as well as forsoaking candle wicks.   Boric acid's lubricating properties were discoverdserendipitously by Ali Erdemir at Argonne National Laboratorynear Chicago. Dr. Erdemir, who calls himself a tribologist,or friction expert, says he was investigating the use ofboric oxide, a white crystalline powder, as a possiblehigh-temperature lubricant. He noticed, however, that boricoxide became slippery at room temperature. He found that theboric oxide was absorbing water from the air to become boricacid.   It turns out that when powdered boric acid is spread overmachine parts, it forms layers that are only loosely bondedtogether and thus easily slip past each other. The atoms ofeach layer, however, are strongly bonded and resist breakingapart. The result is a lubricant that is slipperier thanother dry lubricants and tougher and longer-lasting thangraphite. One drawback: it might dissolve in the rain.   The discovery, itself, isn't patentable but some of itsapplications are, Dr. Erdemir says. &quot;There's been atremendous interest from industry, and we're working with anumber of companies on special applications.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          Genetic fingerprinting of bulls is developed by Universityof Wisconsin researchers to help dairy-cow breeders picksires that have inherited the genes for high milk production.. . .
