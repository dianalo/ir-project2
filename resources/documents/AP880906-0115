Prime Minister Hussein Musavi attempted to resign Monday toavoid what he feared would be a no-confidence vote in parliamentover the post-Persian Gulf war reconstruction policies he advocates.   Musavi's resignation was rejected by President Ali Khameneihours before parliament was due to vote, Iran's official IslamicRepublic News Agency said in a report monitored from Nicosia.   ``If you decided to resign, it would have been better if you hadat least informed me or other high ranking officials,'' TehranRadio said, quoting Khomeini's letter.   ``At a time when Muslims donate their sons to help Islam, thisis not the right time for complaining and resigning,'' the lettersaid, in a reference to the 1 million casualties suffered in theeight-year Iran-Iraq war. Both sides accepted a U.N.-sponseredcease-fire on Aug. 20.   The fact that parliament might exercise its right to rejectCabinet ministers was not sufficient cause for resigning,Khomeini's letter said.   Khomeini, adopting a fatherly tone at the end of the letter,said he liked Musavi and suggested they meet soon so he couldremind the prime minister of the problems Iran still faces.   Western analysts who specialize in Iranian affairs said Khomeinimay have intervened to keep Musavi's government in office a fewmore months to prevent a rupture right after the cease-fire withIraq.   They noted that Khomeini rescued Musavi from a no-confidencevote in the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, four years ago to avoida split while the war was at its height.   Word of the resignation offer first surfaced when Tehran'sJomhuri Eslami, a publication of Iran's Islamic clerics that Musavionce edited, printed his lengthy letter to Khamenei.   Musavi, prime minister since 1981, said his planning and budgetminister, Massoud Zanjani, resigned Saturday and that the future ofhis energy, construction and trade ministers were in doubt.   Musavi said he believed ``five to eight of his ministers willnot get the vote of confidence needed for them to continue theirresponsibilities.''   He did not identify all eight, who comprise more than one-thirdof the 21-man cabinet he named July 21 after parliamentaryelections in April and May.   He acknowledged ``differences of opinion with regard to domesticand international policies,'' but said they must not ``detract fromthe need for unity in confronting conspiracies.''   Shavan Chubin, a Geneva-based specialist on Iranian affairs,said Khomeini, ``if he wants to avoid change at this critical time,could simply tell the Majlis to vote for Musavi _ for now.'' Thatmeeting, intially set for Tuesday, was rescheduled for Sunday.   Chubin said in a telephone interview that ``the passing of thewar was bound to reopen old schisms. There were bound to bedifficulties as Iran moved into the post-war era.   Chubin and other analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said Musavi has been at odds over post-war reconstruction andeconomic development with Khamenei and Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran'smilitary commander and powerful parliament speaker. ``Theportfolios Musavi mentioned indicate that the problem liesprimarily in the economic sector,'' Chubin said.   Musavi has long advocated greater state control of the economy.He was opposed by Khamenei, who has close links with the``bazaaris,'' the wealthy merchant class, and by conservativeclerics.   That split, which has intensified political uncertainty,sharpened when the fighting stopped. Iran's leaders announced theyhad begun planning the massive task of post-war reconstruction,including to what extent Iran should call in foreign companies tohelp it rebuild.   ``Musavi is not keen on getting involved with foreign companiesand having Iran go into debt,'' Chubin said. ``Khamenei andRafsanjani take a more practical approach.''</TEXT></DOC>
