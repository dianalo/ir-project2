Salvador Valdez had not be in contact with Cadena Radio Centrosince Tuesday, said Barrett Alley, president of the Dallas-basednetwork that provides programming for 26 affiliates in the UnitedStates.   ``If a foreign correspondent hasn't filed (a story) in four fulldays, then there's a problem,'' Alley said.   The 44-year-old reporter was staying at a hotel in San Salvador,but had checked out early Tuesday after interviewing top governmentofficials, including President Alfredo Cristiani.   Alley said Valdez called in seven stories and was not heard fromagain.   ``We believe his last call may have been from somewhere otherthan the hotel,'' said Alley, who was in Los Angeles for business.   The news agency has contacted the Embassy of El Salvador inWashington, and the press officer at the U.S. Embassy in ElSalvador, but have yet to get any responses, said Alley.   Officials with the Embassy of El Salvador were not available forcomment. Calls to the embassy were not answered.   Valdez left for the war-torn Central American country Nov. 25after leftist rebels mounted an offensive in the nation's capitalof San Salvador.   More than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict betweenleftist guerrillas and the U.S.-supported government, the majorityof them civilians.   Gilberto Cortez, news director for the agency, said in atelephone interview from Dallas he is trying to stay positive abouthis colleague's condition.   Valdez had not registered with the U.S. Embassy there or withmilitary authorities, a standard procedure for journalists inforeign countries.   ``He had orders to register and he had all the proper presscredentials,'' Cortez said. ``What I believe is that maybe he gotinvolved too deep with the information he is sending us.''   Cortez said Valdez is the operations manager for the agency, butwas sent to cover reaction of the uprising because the agency wasshort-staffed and Valdez has extensive experience as a reporter.   Valdez had interviewed a number of government officials,including defense and health ministers, over four days, Cortez said.   Valdez was born in Mexico, and is a U.S. citizen whose home isin Dallas. He has worked for the radio network since its inception3{ years ago.   Cadena Radio Centro provides 18 Spanish newscasts a day toaffiliates across the country, including radio stations inCalifornia, Texas, New York and Chicago. The network also providesmusic programming and sports information.  </TEXT></DOC>
