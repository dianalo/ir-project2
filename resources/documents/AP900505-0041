A portion of the flow, which had moved about a third of a milesince Thursday night, cut a speeding path around the town's hub.   Part of the flow was filling up a gully that separated themolten mass from the Kalapana Store and Drive-In and the KalapanaMauna Kea Congregational Church.   Star of the Sea Church, a Roman Catholic church known as the``painted church'' because of its colorful murals, was moved,beating by a few hours a portion of the flow that crossed Highway137 halfway between the town and Harry K. Brown State Park, aquarter of a mile away.   Three more homes burned Friday to boost the count to 134 sinceKilauea began its current eruption in January 1983. Three of thelast families to flee the area managed to move their belongingsbefore their homes were cut off by the encroaching flow.   A tractor trailer began moving the church about 7 a.m. Friday.It was brought to a roadside area where other houses that weresalvaged are located.   Church officials have not said where the church will berelocated.   An elderly native Hawaiian woman pleaded with workers andofficials not to move the church. But Bishop Joseph Ferrariodecided last week to move it to preserve its interior paintings.   ``How can you move it? How can you move it?'' the woman screamedat workers preparing to move the church.   Others echoed similar sentiments.   ``How can you call it Star of the Sea Church if it isn't by thesea?'' asked Kapena Kamahele, a Hilo resident whose family has along history in Kalapana.   Kamahele said the destruction of Kalapana, one of the lastvestiges of the ``old style'' Hawaii, was seen by many longtimeresidents as the punishment for mistreatment of the land.   Many of the newer, non-Hawaiian people who moved to the areafailed to understand the Hawaiian village lifestyle that many inthis coastal community held sacred, she said.   ``We are erasing the chalkboard and starting from scratch,''Kamahele said. ``Hawaiians will teach all people how to do it.''   Civil Defense officials ordered members of the Congregationalchurch who had spent the night in the building to evacuate Fridaymorning.   ``The book is closed. We open a new book today,'' said BerniceMcKeague, church moderator.   Church members held a prayer vigil Thursday night and watched asthe lava built up in a small gully behind the church.   The Kalapana Store, the meeting center of the town, remainedstanding just like its owner said it would.   ``Madam Pele (Hawaii's volcano goddess) will never take me,''said Walter Yamaguchi, the 82-year-old owner. He said he left somesupplies in the store to sell once it reopened.   However, the flow continued to build behind his store.   Of increasing concern to authorities was the threat to publichealth when the lava begins to fall into the ocean.   When lava hits the water, it explodes and releases gasesincluding hydrochloric acid, a strong-smelling chemical that isquite dangerous, said Civil Defense spokesman Bud Trulson.</TEXT></DOC>
