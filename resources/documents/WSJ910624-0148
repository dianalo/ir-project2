According to a medical study in the Netherlands, publishedin the British Medical Journal, people who smoke are lesslikely to contract Alzheimer's disease, the most common formof senile dementia.</LP><TEXT>   What's more, the study says, the risk of developingAlzheimer's lessens in inverse proportion to the number ofcigarettes smoked.   &quot;In six families in which the disease was apparentlyinherited . . . the mean age of onset was 4.17 years later insmoking patients than in non-smoking patients from the samefamily,&quot; the report's authors state.   Nonetheless, the study is unlikely to provide much comfortto the tobacco industry. Although its findings &quot;suggest aninverse association between smoking and Alzheimer's disease .. . smoking cannot be advocated for other health reasons,&quot;the report says.   The study, financed by various Dutch and EuropeanCommunity research groups, involved 198 patients with earlyonset of Alzheimer's disease, plus a control group of 198people without the condition, matched by age and sex. Theresearchers also studied the families of 17 patients in whomAlzheimer's disease was apparently an inherited condition.   Their conclusion was that nicotine from cigarette smokemay help to guard against Alzheimer's disease by increasingthe level of certain chemicals in the brain. Brain levels ofthese chemicals have been observed to diminish in patientswith both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.   The conclusion has &quot;no relevance for prevention ofAlzheimer's disease because of the adverse health effects ofsmoking,&quot; the report's authors stated. But it may open upavenues for research into what causes both Alzheimer's andParkinson's disease, they suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
