(16 U.S.C.4201-4245). The authority of the Act supplements that already providedin the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). Since May 12, 1978, the Africanelephant has been listed as a threatened species under the ESA, and hasbeen subject to protective regulations promulgated pursuant to section4(d) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) that further the conservation of theAfrican elephant. See 50 CFR 17.40(e).On January 6, 1989, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) submitted a written petitionpursuant to section 2202(d) of the Act asking the Fish and Wildlife Service(Service) to establish a moratorium on African elephant ivory imports fromthe Democratic Republic of Somalia. A copy of the Summary and Conclusionsection of the petition is included as an Appendix of this notice. A copyof the complete petition may be inspected at the Office of Management Authorityat the address noted above under <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 2202(d)(2) requires the Service to publish a notice of receiptof such a petition in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> to provide an opportunity for public comment,and to issue a decision on the petition no later than 90 days after theclose of the comment period. The decision on whether to establish a moratoriumrequested in a petition must be made according to sections 2202(a)(1) and2201(b)(1) for ivory producing countries or section 2202(b) for intermediarycountries.Independent of the duty to decide on section 2202(d) petitions, the Serviceis required by sections 2202(a)(1) and 2202(b) to establish a moratoriumon the import of ivory from an ivory producing or intermediary countryimmediately whenever the Service finds the country has failed to meet theappropriate criteria.Pursuant to section 2202(a)(1), the Service must establish a moratoriumon imports of ivory from an ivory producing country that fails to meetthe criteria set forth in section 2201(b)(1):(A) The country is a party to the Convention on International Trade inEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and adheres to the CITESIvory Control System.(B) The country's elephant conservation program is based on the best availableinformation, and the country is making expeditious progress in compilinginformation on the elephant habitat condition and carrying capacity, totalpopulation and population trends, and the annual reproduction and mortalityof the elephant populations within the country.(C) The taking of elephants in the country is effectively controlled andmonitored.(D) The country's ivory quota is determined on the basis of informationreferred to in subparagraph (B) and reflects the amount of ivory whichis confiscated or consumed domestically by the country.(E) The country has not authorized or allowed the export of amounts ofraw ivory which exceed its ivory quota under the CITES Ivory Control System.Pursuant to section 2202(b), the Service must establish a moratorium onimports of ivory from an intermediary country that meets any of the followingcriteria: (1) Is not a party to CITES;(2) Does not adhere to the CITES Ivory Control System;(3) Imports raw ivory from a country that is not an ivory producing country;(4) Imports raw or worked ivory from a country that is not a party to CITES;(5) Imports raw or worked ivory that originates in an ivory producing countryin violation of the laws of that ivory producing country;(6) Substantially increases its imports of raw or worked ivory from a countrythat is subject to a moratorium under this title during the first threemonths of that moratorium; or(7) Imports raw or worked ivory from a country that is subject to a moratoriumunder this title after the first three months of that moratorium, unlessthe ivory is imported by vessel during the first six months of that moratoriumand is accompanied by shipping documents which show that it was exportedbefore the establishment of the moratorium.Section 2202(f) of the Act provides that ivory confiscated by an ivoryproducing or intermediary country and disposed of pursuant to the CITESIvory Control System shall not be the sole grounds for establishment ofa moratorium, provided that all proceeds from the sale of the confiscatedivory are used to enhance wildlife conservation or the conservation purposesof CITES.<ITAG tagnum="84">The World Wildlife Fund Petition</ITAG>In June 1988, Somalia established an ivory export quota of 5,000 tusksunder the Ivory Control System administered by the Secretariat of the Conventionon International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).In November 1988, Somalia increased its quota to 8,000 tusks. Somalia hasstated that all of the ivory was confiscated.The Service's records indicate that approximated 290 shipments of ivoryoriginating in Somalia entered the United States during 1987 and 1988.The vast majority of these shipments were imports of worked ivory exportedby Hong Kong. The declared value of these shipments approximately $2,400,000.WWF's petition shows that Somalia has sold and exported over 21,000 tusksin the last three years and has declared that all of these tusks were confiscatedand of Somalian origin. This number of tusks correlates with approximately13,800 elephants. The petition attaches a copy of Somalia's 1986 annualCITES report, which declares that 16,986 tusks were exported that year,representing about 9,440 elephants. The best population estimates, however,indicate that Somalia's elephant population was no greater than 4,500 elephantsin 1987, and was no higher than 8,600 in 1985.The WWF petition presents information indicating that a large percentageof these tusks must have been poached in either Kenya or Ethiopia, twocountries that share a border with Somalia. The information includes acopy of a letter dated March 19, 1987, and signed by President Barre ofSomalia that appears to authorize the import into Somalia of ivory tusksfrom Kenya and Ethiopia. Kenya, which is a party to CITES, prohibits allhunting of elephants and all private commerce in ivory. Ethiopia, whichis not a party to CITES, prohibits the taking of elephants except for alimited number of sport hunting licenses issued each year.Based on this information, which is discussed in greater detail in theSummary and Conclusion of the petition which is appended to this noticeand in the complete petition on file at the Office of Management Authority,WWF asks the Service to establish a moratorium on imports of ivory fromSomalia into the United States for the following reasons:1. The large number of tusks exported by Somalia in recent years and plannedfor export in the near future, all of which are claimed by Somalia to havebeen taken in Somalia, indicate that Somalia is not effectively controllingand monitoring the taking of elephants within its borders. These are groundsfor establishment of a moratorium on Somalia as an ivory producing countryunder section 2202(b)(1)(C) of the Act.2. The disparity between the size of Somalia's elephant population andthe number of tusks Somalia declared in its 1986 annual report to CITESas having been taken in Somalia indicates that Somalia falsely declaredto CITES the country of origin of the exported tusks. Somalia, therefore,is not adhering to the CITES Ivory Control System, which is cause for establishmentof a moratorium on Somalia as either an ivory producing country under section2201(b)(1)(A) or an intermediary country under section 2202(b)(2).3. Imports of ivory from Ethiopia, which is not a party to CITES, thattook place after the October 7, 1988, enactment of the Act with the authorizationof the Somali government would be cause for establishment of a moratoriumon Somalia as an intermediary country under section 2202(b)(4).4. The imports of ivory from either Kenya or Ethiopia into Somalia werein violation of the laws of those countries, and would be cause for establishmentof a moratorium under section 2202(b)(5) if they were sanctioned by theSomali government. If these unlawful imports were indeed confiscated asclaimed in Somalia, and the proceeds from the sale of the ivory were notused solely for wildlife conservation purposes, then the confiscated ivoryprovisions of the Act (section 2202(f)) would not apply, and a moratoriumcould be established under section 2202(b)(5) of the Act.Pursuant to section 2202(d)(2) of the Act, the Service requests commentson the information contained in and actions requested by the WWF petitionin order to assist the Service in analyzing and responding to the petition.All comments received by the date above under DATES will be considered.The Service will render a decision on the petition within 90 days afterthe close of the comment period. <ITAG tagnum="84">Establishment of Moratorium </ITAG>The Service has an independent duty under sections 2202(a)(l) and 2202(b)to establish a moratorium immediately whenever the information availableto the Service demonstrates that an ivory producing or intermediary countrymeets any of the criteria for establishment of a moratorium. In this case,the Service finds that the available information is sufficient to supportestablishment of a moratorium on imports of ivory from Somalia based uponseveral of the sections 2201(b)(1) and 2202(b) criteria. Somalia has exported over 21,100 tusks in the last three years, which representsabout 13,800 elephants. Somalia's 1986 annual report to CITES declaresthat, in 1986 alone, Somalia exported 16,986 tusks, which represents about9,440 elephants. In the 1986 annual report to CITES and in other statements,Somalia has declared that all of these tusks are of Somali origin and thatall the tusks were confiscated. Yet, the best estimates of Somalia's elephantpopulation are that the population was no greater than 4,500 in 1987 andwas no more than 8,600 in 1985. Somalia thus has declared exports of domesticivory in the last three years that represent approximately three timesthe number of elephants remaining in Somalia. The Service considers thegreat disparity between these figures to be sufficient to support findingsthat (1) Somalia cannot be effectively controlling and monitoring the takingof elephants in Somalia, and (2) ivory is being imported into Somalia fromits neighboring countries of Kenya and Ethiopia. Section 2202(a)(l) of the Act requires the Service to establish a moratoriumon ivory imports from an ivory producing country immediately upon findingthat the country fails to meet any of the criteria of section 2201(b)(1).The evidence showing that Somalia is not effectively controlling and monitoringthe taking of domestic ivory demonstrates Somalia fails to meet section2201(b)(1)(C). Although Somalia's 1986 annual report to CITES declaresthat all of the ivory orignated in Somalia, the information available tothe Service indicates Somalia actually imported at least part of the ivory.This false declaration to CITES demonstrates Somalia is not adhering tothe CITES Ivory Control System, as required by section 2201(b)(l)(A).Section 2202(b) of the Act requires the Service to establish a moratoriumon imports of ivory from an intermediary country immediately upon findingthat the country meets any of the criteria of that section. Because theevidence demonstrates that Somalia has acted as an intermediary country,the evidence of its failure to adhere to the CITES Ivory Control Systemalso shows that Somalia meets the section 2202(b)(2) criterion. The discrepancies between the amount of ivory exported by Somalia and thenumber of elephants remaining in the country demonstrates that ivory isbeing imported into Somalia from Kenya and Ethiopia. Somalia thereforemeets both the section 2202(b)(4) and (5) criteria since both Kenya andEthiopia prohibit the taking of elephants and Ethiopia is not a party toCITES. The Service interprets section 2202(b) in conjunction with section2202(f) to mean that imports of ivory into Somalia by private parties thatare confiscated by the Somali government do not require establishment ofa moratorium on Somali ivory provided (1) the Somali government has notsanctioned the imports, and (2) the Somali government disposes of the ivorypursuant to the requirements of section 2202(f). Although the evidenceindicates that Somalia must have known the origin of the ivory, the evidencedoes not show clearly that the Somali government actively authorized theimports. The WWF does present evidence to support its contention that theSomali government sanctioned the imports, but the Service wishes to reservejudgment on this issue in order to consider information that may be receivedduring the comment period on the petition. In addition, however, the availableinformation does not show clearly that Somalia has disposed of the ivoryaccording to the requirements of section 2202(f). The Service specificallyrequests comments on this issue. For the above reasons the Service finds that Somalia fails to meet allof the criteria of section 2201(b)(1) of the Act, and meets at least oneof the criteria of section 2202(b). The Service therefore establishes amoratorium on imports of ivory from Somalia into the United States effectiveon the date of this notice. The Service also requests comments on whether this moratorium should besuspended. All comments received by the date listed above under DATES willbe considered. Consistent with section 2202(c) the Service will considersuspension of the moratorium concurrently with its consideration of theWWF petition. This Notice was prepared by Frank McGilvrey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Office of Management Authority.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank M. Dunkle,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Fish and Wildlife Service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix_Summary and Conclusion of the WWF Petition</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the last three years Somalia has sold at least 21,140 tusks andhas been intending to sell an additional 3,846 tusks as soon as possible.The government claims that these are all confiscated tusks of Somalia origin.The total represents some 13,800 elephants, however, a figure far higherthan Somalia's entire estimated elephant population.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If all these elephants, or even a fifth of them, were actually killedin Somalia, in violation of Somali law, it would be <T3>prima facia</T3> evidence that the taking of elephants in Somalia isnot effectively controlled and monitored and would be cause for the Secretaryto establish an immediate moratorium on imports of ivory from Somalia.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Simple arithemtic, however would indicate that a large percentageof these tusks must have been poached in neighboring countries where elephantsare fully protected by law. It is well documented that the intensive poachingin Kenya's Meru and Tsavo National parks has been conducted by Somali tribesmenwho can move freely across the Kenya/Somalia border. Three poachers apprehendedin Tsavo in November 1988 reportedly carried identification cards fromSomalia. Much of the ivory poached in Tsavo reportedly moves up by thecoast by Dhow from Mombassa to Mogadishu. The attached letter signed bySomalia's president confirms reports from other sources that the poachingand illegal trade through Somalia is condoned and facilitiated by Somalianofficials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If this is the case, and if the Somali government in its annual CITESreport has falsely identified the country of origin of these tusks, itis not adhering to the CITES Ivory Control System. This is cause for animmediate moratorium.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If any of the 8,000 tusks in Somalia's quota originated in Ethiopia,which is not a party to CITES, it would be unlawful under ESA to importthem into the United States. If any of them entered Somalia after October7, 1988, with the authorization of the Somali government, it would be causefor an immediate moratorium under AECA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If, as seems certain, many of the 8,000 tusks were imported into Somaliafrom Ethiopia or Kenya, it was in violation of the laws of those countriesand is cause for an immediate moratorium, if such imports were sanctionedby the government of Somalia or if the proceeds from the sale of such ivoryare not used solely for conservation purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because Somalia has informed the CITES Secretariat that all 8,000tusks were confiscated, they are presumed to be government property. Whethergovernment funds were used to compensate or reward the poachers or middlemenand whether such persons benefit from the government's sale of this confiscatedivory are questions that should be answered before any more Somali ivoryis allowed into internatonal trade. The Secretary needs to be assured priorto the sale of the remaining tusks that the government of Somalia has notsanctioned the import of ivory from Ethiopia and Kenya and that all proceedsfrom the sale of any confiscated ivory is to be used solely to enhancewildlife conservation programs or conservation purposes of CITES.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For all the reasons cited above, World Wildlife Fund believes thatSomalia has provided sufficient grounds for the Secretary to establisha moratorium immediately on all imports of raw and worked ivory from Somaliainto the United States. WWF urges the Secretary to act quickly before Somaliasells any more elephant tusks. If a moratorium is imposed on Somalia, otherintermediary countries would not purchase the Somali ivory without havinga moratorium imposed on their own ivory exports to the United States. WWFbelieves that immediate action by the Secretary against Somalia could preventadditional tusks from entering international trade until all questionsas to their origin and legality are answered satisfactorily. Such boldaction is absolutely necessary to destroy financial incentive for poachersand middlemen and to save Kenya's elephants from extinction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In conclusion, WWF respectfully requests the Secretary to impose animmediate moratorium on Somalia and, following that, to impose a similarmoratorium on any country that purchases or accepts any of the elephanttusks now awaiting sale in Somalia.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-4258 Filed 2-23-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-55-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
