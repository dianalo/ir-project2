Mr. Keating wants to buy back $500 million of the assetsof Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association, with no money down andgovernment financing, and manage the assets so the U.S.doesn't lose any money on them. It's all aimed at provinghe's a smart businessman -- not the devious executive thegovernment says he is.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I've made a lot of money for myself and for other peopleover the years, and I just want to show people that what thegovernment says isn't true,&quot; Mr. Keating said in a meeting inNew York with reporters and editors from The Wall StreetJournal. Mr. Keating is chairman of Phoenix-based AmericanContinental Corp., which was Lincoln's parent before thegovernment seized the Irvine, Calif., thrift last year.   In five years, under his proposal, the U.S. would get its$500 million plus interest. And he would contribute anadditional $50 million for creditors of American Continental,including irate holders of $300 million in almost worthlessAmerican Continental bonds sold at Lincoln branches. Mr.Keating and two associates would personally guarantee the$550 million.   Mr. Keating plans to make his proposal in the next fewweeks to an Arizona federal district court that is overseeingAmerican Continental's bankruptcy-law filing. The planrequires the approval of the court, creditors and theResolution Trust Corp., the government agency overseeing thecleanup of the U.S. thrift industry. Even Keating associatesconcede it is difficult to imagine the government, which hasa $1.1 billion civil racketeering suit against Mr. Keatingand other former members of Lincoln and American Continentalmanagement, entrusting Lincoln's assets to him. Thegovernment has made the charge that Mr. Keating and hiscolleagues engaged in phony tax and loan transactions todivert money from Lincoln into American Continental.   Mr. Keating has denied any wrongdoing.   &quot;Psychologically, this may be difficult for the RTC,&quot; saidJames Feder, an attorney for Mr. Keating.   But Mr. Feder insisted that financially, Mr. Keating isoffering the government a no-risk deal. The $500 million inassets -- including stock, junk bonds, loans and real estate-- Mr. Keating would like to manage have been marked down bythe RTC to $250 million, Mr. Feder said. Mr. Keating iswilling to promise the government $500 million, the bookvalue of the assets when Lincoln, which had assets totaling$5.5 billion, was taken over in April 1989. The assets don'tinclude the opulent Phoenician resort hotel in Phoenix, thecrown jewel of Lincoln's real estate holdings.   &quot;The government may sell {the assets} for $250 million.We're saying we'll give them $500 million plus interest andreturn money to the bondholders,&quot; Mr. Feder said. Mr. Federinsisted that by taking the assets at full book value andpromising the extra $50 million, there's little likelihoodMr. Keating could make a killing. &quot;There's no harm or foul tothe government other than that if he succeeds, he proves thegovernment wrong,&quot; Mr. Feder said.   RTC lawyers working on the Lincoln case couldn't bereached to comment on Mr. Keating's plan over the weekend.But it was scoffed at by lawyers for American Continental'sunsecured creditors.   The proposal &quot;sounds like the same thing he's been doingall along, using government money to do whatever he wants todo,&quot; said Susan Illston, a bondholder attorney. She addedthat his offer to personally guarantee the $550 million topurchase assets of American Continental and Lincoln &quot;doesn'tmake any sense. He claims to have no money.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
