Also considered are a comparison of gamma, neutron, andproton irradiations of multimode fibers, a pinhole camera for hot environmentviewing of electron beam materials processing, and the utilization ofoptical image data from the advanced test accelerator. Other topics includethe application of an interferometer spectrometer aboard the Space Shuttlewith a payload specialist in the control loop, hydrogen chloride measurementsin launch-vehicle exhaust clouds, and a rocket-borne telescoped Fouriertransform spectrometer operating at 10 K.</TEXT></DOC>
