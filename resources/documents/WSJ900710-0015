Several heads of state of major OPEC members suddenly arestepping in, where their oil ministers have failed, to try tocurb the organization's overproduction as petroleum marketsweaken from the glut.</LP><TEXT>   One reason is the mounting loss in revenues for OPEC's 13member nations -- now about $100 million a day -- from thedrop of one-third in the price of petroleum so far this year.Also, concern is growing that the oil oversupply will triggera crash similar to the 1986 collapse that drove the price ofoil as low as $7 a barrel.   &quot;It's hurting them to the point where they are going to dosomething, at least to contain the damage, and a decision todo something has to come at the heads of state level,&quot; saidPaul Mlotok, an oil economist with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.   Presidents Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Carlos Andres Perez ofVenezuela and Suharto of Indonesia are among those taking aharder line toward the quota cheaters, such as Kuwait and theUnited Arab Emirates, which are held responsible for OPEC'soverproduction. But the king of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's chiefproducer, seems to be emerging in the leading role incharting the new strategy.   Further evidence of this development came from the Saudigovernment. According to an official statement issued by theSaudi Press Agency, Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, wasquoted as saying King Fahd is &quot;fully committed to restoringstability to the oil markets.&quot;   Though technical factors also were cited, some oilanalysts said this may have helped spark a late-day rally onthe New York Mercantile Exchange, after several days ofdecline. The futures price of crude oil for August deliverysurged in the last few minutes of trading yesterday, tosettle at $16.58 a barrel, up 11 cents from Friday's close,after falling to a low of $16.05 during the day. Crudeselsewhere were mostly lower, with North Sea spot pricesdropping between five cents and 45 cents a barrel.   A report that the Soviet Union, facing a lack of fuel fordomestic use, will cut its oil exports by 140,000 barrels aday had little impact on world markets. According to the DowJones International Petroleum Report, however, rumors whichwere later confirmed that Phibro Energy Inc. sold threemillion barrels of North Sea crudes for July loading to theU.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve gave crude spot and futuresprices a boost late in the day.   The Saudi statement didn't elaborate on steps being takenby King Fahd, except to quote Mr. Nazer further as saying thekingdom is exerting &quot;maximum efforts&quot; toward the success ofthe OPEC midyear meeting, which is to begin July 25 inGeneva. Also, the statement noted that Mr. Nazer's commentswere made during a briefing to the Saudi cabinet on hisrecent meetings with other Persian Gulf ministers.   In the past few days, Mr. Nazer has carried a message fromhis king regarding the oil situation to Kuwait, the UnitedArab Emirates, Iraq and Qatar; today, Mr. Nazer'scounterparts from Kuwait, the UAE and Iraq are to meet withhim in Saudi Arabia, in what some oil analysts suggest couldresult in a Saudi-engineered compromise proposal to be placedbefore the Geneva meeting of all the oil ministers.Speculation is that such a plan would call for both Kuwaitand the UAE to cut back on output through the third quarter,in return for higher official quotas in the fourth quarter.   Iraq's full backing would be necessary for such a plan towork. The Iraqi president, who wants higher oil prices tohelp meet costs of the reconstruction of his countryfollowing its eight-year war against Iran, has beenparticularly irritated about the way Kuwait and the UAE haveignored their quotas.   Mr. Hussein of Iraq is hardly alone in his irritation. InJakarta Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister,told reporters after a meeting with his president that &quot;thereis no use talking about quotas if the price remains low.&quot; Hesaid that a number of OPEC members have failed to keep theirpledge to help shore up the price of oil by cutting output,and that OPEC discussions should focus on efforts to improvethe market instead of &quot;wasting time and energy debating onquota distribution.&quot;   In Caracas, meanwhile, the president of Venezuela alsocalled for production discipline in OPEC. &quot;Regarding thatsituation,&quot; he said, &quot;we are promoting a summit meeting ofheads of state . . . of OPEC member countries, which we hopecould take place during the course of this year.&quot; Such asummit, he said, would &quot;discuss current and future issues ofthe oil business and reach definite agreements that wouldfurther strengthen&quot; OPEC.</TEXT></DOC>
