Nationally, the 2 percent increase in 1987 followed rises of 5percent in 1985 and 6 percent in 1986.   The amount of violent crime reported to police in 1987 edgeddown 1 percent, the FBI said, but the level of property crime wasup 2 percent.   The FBI's crime index level was up 1 percent in the Midwest, 3percent in the Northeast and 4 percent in the South. The Westexperienced the only decline, moving downward 1 percent.   Across the country, the number of reported aggravated assaultsrose 2 percent from 1987, while larcenies rose 3 percent and motorvehicle thefts rose 5 percent, according to the preliminaryfigures. Those three categories of offenses traditionally accountfor about 70 percent of the major crime reported to the FBI bypolice departments around the country.   The number of murders reported to police fell by 4 percent lastyear; forcible rapes dropped by 1 percent; robberies, by 5 percent;burglaries, by 1 percent; and arsons, by 5 percent.   It is difficult to determine whether the FBI crime data gatheredfrom police departments signifies an actual increase in crimelevels or if the rise is due to the fact that victims are simplycoming forward more frequently to report the offenses than they didin the past.   A survey last month by the Justice Department's Bureau ofJustice Statistics found that 37 percent of serious crimes werereported to police agencies last year, compared with 32 percentwhen the bureau's survey was first instituted in 1973.   The bureau's survey of households, which measures crime that isboth reported and unreported to police, found that the amount ofcrime in the United States last year remained stable.   The FBI report and the bureau study both recorded declines incrime levels during the first half of the decade. Many researchersforecast an increase in crime in coming years as young people inincreasing numbers move into the most crime-prone age group of ages15 to 24.</TEXT></DOC>
