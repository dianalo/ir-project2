However, the company said earnings before interest, taxes,depreciation and amortization were a record $536 million.Time Warner, like other heavily leveraged media and cabletelevision companies, has been attempting to persuade WallStreet to value it using that measure of its cash flow,instead of on the more traditional earnings-based valuations.</LP><TEXT>   In the financial results released today, Time Warnerpresented its 1989 figures on a historical and a pro formabasis. Assuming the purchase of 100% of Warner as of Jan. 1,1989, earnings for the quarter ended March 31 beforeinterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of thecompany's operating units increased 16% to $536 million from$461 million a year earlier.

Ross, co-chairmen of TimeWarner, said in a statement that each of the company'sbusinesses &quot;produced outstanding results, with five of oursix divisions setting new records.&quot;   On a pro forma basis, magazine division earnings beforeinterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the firstquarter dropped to $54 million from $70 million in the 1989period. Time Warner said that, as expected, the start-upcosts of Entertainment Weekly hurt magazine results.
