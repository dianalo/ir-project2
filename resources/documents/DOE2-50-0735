As yet, only NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington and theBritish and West German governments seem to be taking the Soviet signalsseriously. Many in NATO seem to console themselves with the hope thatsince Soviet unilateral reductions might jeopardize control over EasternEurope they will never happen. That is especially inappropriate in viewof domestic political, manpower, and budgetary constraints within NATOthat are likely to inhibit conventional force improvements. Instead oftaking refuge in denial or defensiveness, NATO could get out ahead ofany Soviet initiative by proposing to eliminate NATO's battlefield nuclearweapons and constrain aircraft modernization in return for a substantialwithdrawal and demobilization of Soviet armor and elimination of Sovietbattlefield nuclear weapons. Or NATO might prepare to reciprocate anyunilateral move by the East with a gesture of its own, for instance,withdrawing another 1000 short-range nuclear weapons from Europe or modestlyreducing conventional forces and delaying some planned improvements.That would help NATO regain the political high ground. It might alsogive the West time to assess the military implications of various reductionschemes and prepare a negotiating position of its own. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
