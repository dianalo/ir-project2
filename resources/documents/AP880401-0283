(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robeson County, a house divided againstitself, shudders and heaves with the tremors of a power struggle150 years in the making.   The week-old murder of Julian Pierce, lawyer, judicial candidateand Indian activist, has shaken this troubled tri-racial county,where minorities are in the majority but whites are in control.   Amid anger and grief, amid rumors of official corruption andpublic paranoia, amid the blooming forsythia and the early springheat, residents of Robeson County _ black, white and Indian _ burythe dead and wonder when there will be peace for the living.   ``We're either going to pull ourselves apart, or we're going topull ourselves together,'' said Eric Prevatte, a local businessman,his eyes red-rimmed after delivering a eulogy for Pierce. ``And weall have a common interest in pulling ourselves together. Thealternative is just unthinkable.''   The unthinkable has become almost inevitable in Robeson, 944square miles of tall trees, hot summers and a history ofunhappiness.   It is one of the state's largest counties, and one of itspoorest. On a spring day, Lumberton, the county seat, is deceptive;beneath the serene facade of stately brick homes and wide verandas,the quiet streets named for the trees that shade them, a stew ofracial suspicion and fear simmers and sometimes bubbles to thesurface.   On Feb. 1, Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, twoTuscarora Indians, charged into The Robesonian newspaper officewith shotguns and took at least 17 people hostage. No one was hurt.The pair apologized to their captives, many of whom sympathizedwith their grievances.   ``It wasn't right,'' said Tanya Dial, a Lumbee Indian and one ofthe hostages. ``But it was something they had to do.''   They surrendered 10 hours later after Gov. Jim Martin agreed tosend a task force to investigate allegations of corruption in locallaw enforcement.   Sheriff Hubert Stone has said he is resented for his zealouspursuit of criminals. But local leaders say Robeson has a huge drugproblem, with cocaine flowing in from the coast and up Interstate95, a critical artery in the nation's drug network. The air isthick with rumors of official complicity, but there is no proof,and plenty of denial.   ``It's a county that has allegations going on, mainly just wildallegations,'' said Bob Horne, editor of The Robesonian.   ``People don't trust the sheriff's department,'' said Jo AnnTyner, a legal secretary and life-long county resident. ``I thinkpeople have the evidence _ they're just scared. They want theirfamilies protected before they'll come forward.''   Hatcher and Jacobs also demanded an investigation into the Jan.13 death of Billy McKellar, 27, a black inmate in the county jail,whom authorities said died of an ``asthmatic cardiac arrest.'' Somepeople do not believe the whole truth has surfaced in that death,or in Julian Pierce's murder, or in up to 17 other mysterious orunsolved deaths in the county in the last five years.   On a moonless, drizzly night in November 1986, Deputy KevinStone, the sheriff's son, stopped a 1980 Pinto driven by Jimmy EarlCummings, a Lumbee Indian known to police as a drug dealer. Withinminutes, the unarmed Cummings was lying at the bottom of a ditchalong the road, a bullet from Stone's gun in his face.   The deputy said the gun discharged accidentally. At thecoroner's inquest, a six-member jury agreed.   Cummings' family, given less than two hours' notice of thehearing, were denied time to find an attorney. Reporters were nevernotified. At the time of the inquest, the autopsy results were notavailable.   Not long before Cummings' death, drugs were stolen from thesheriff's evidence room. A former deputy was tried and acquitted inconnection with the theft.   ``There are people who say that Jimmy Earl Cummings had toldpeople before then that he feared for his life, that he was sellingdrugs that had disappeared out of the courthouse,'' Horne said.``Nobody really knows what happened that night, except KevinStone.''   Outraged members of the Concerned Citizens for BetterGovernment, a group founded by Indian activist John Godwin afterCummings' death, bought four pages in The Robesonian and printedthe transcript of the two-hour hearing.   Four months later, Godwin, 72, was dead of injuries sustained ina head-on car collision.   Julian Pierce, 42, an attorney revered in the Lumbee communityand widely respected outside it, had gone to a wake for Godwin thenight of March 25, and later registered voters at a club inLumberton.   Pierce was the favored candidate for a newly created SuperiorCourt judgeship designed by the Legislature to give minoritiesbetter representation. Even though the county's Indians and blackscount 8,000 more registered voters than do the whites, he went outto register 20 more. Every vote counted in this election, somethinghe had worked nine years to achieve.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
