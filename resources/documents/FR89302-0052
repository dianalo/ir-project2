The long-term goal of thiseffort is to develop performance standards for programs, based upon treatmentoutcome. Such standards could serve as an alternative to the detailed requirementscurrently contained in the Federal methadone regulation (21 CFRA Part 291).Ideally, if acceptable standards could be developed, then a treatment programwould simply have to demonstrate that it meets the standards; i.e., thatit is above the threshold for acceptable treatment. To move toward thisgoal, NIDA and FDA believe the first step is to conduct a feasibility studydesigned to identify the practical problems inherent in such a system,the costs, and the benefits. The appendix to this advance notice containsone proposal for a pilot feasibility study. This advance notice solicitspublic comment on the potential value of performance-based evaluation standardsas a means of evaluating treatment programs, on the proposed pilot studycontained in the appendix, and recommendations for other approaches thatwould achieve the same objective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments by May 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305),Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD20857.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Stephen P.

Authority</ITAG>Legislative authority for involvement by the Department of Health and HumanServices in the treatment of narcotic addiction is included in section4 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (Pub.L. 91-513) which requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (theSecretary) to determine the appropriate methods of professional practicefor the medical treatment of narcotic addiction. In addition, the NarcoticAddict Treatment Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-281) was enacted by Congress asa means to ensure that only confirmed narcotic addicts are admitted totreatment, that they receive quality care, and that illicit diversion islimited. Specifically, Pub. L. 93-281 amended the Controlled SubstancesAct (21 U.S.C. 823) to require that practitioners who wish to dispensenarcotic drugs to individuals for the maintenance treatment or detoxificationtreatment of narcotic addiction must be registered annually with the Departmentof Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Registration depends,in part, upon a determination by the Secretary that the applicant is qualified,under treatment standards established by the Secretary, to engage in suchtreatment. In addition, the applicant must comply with standards establishedby the Secretary (after consultation with DEA) respecting the quantitiesof narcotic drugs that may be provided for unsupervised use by individualsin such treatment. Finally, the applicant must comply with standards establishedby DEA respecting security of stocks of narcotic drugs used for such treatmentand maintenance of records on such drugs. The Secretary has delegated theauthority to establish treatment standards to NIDA and the authority toevaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs for use in the treatmentof narcotic addiction to FDA.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>Although the national concern about levels of illicit drug use in thiscountry has led to increased Federal funding for treatment programs, resourcesare limited and must be directed to those drug abuse control activitiesfound to be most effective. Several recent reports acknowledge the needto increase the effectiveness of treatment programs, and make specificrecommendations. The White House Conference for a Drug Free America, amongits treatment recommendations, recommended an increase in treatment slots,the development of a standardized, objective method for determining drugtreatment outcome and treatment effectiveness, and more treatment programaccountability so that Federal funds may be distributed based on effectiveness(Ref. 1). The National Drug Policy Board, established by Executive Order12590 on March 26, 1987, to centralize oversight for all aspects of theFederal anti-drug effort, set an objective to direct Federal research toimprove quality and efficiency of treatment (Ref. 2). The General AccountingOffice, in a report on managing the Federal drug control efforts, statedthat measures of program effectiveness are needed and should be developedby the Federal government (Ref. 3). The report of the Presidential Commissionon the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic recommended that NIDA, inconjunction with State and local agencies and treatment providers, developa plan for increasing the capacity of the drug treatment system. It furtherrecommended that the plan include elements to ensure quality of care andmechanisms to evaluate progress. In addition, the Commission recommendedthat the Federal government develop scientifically based quality assurancemechanisms for evaluating quality of care (Ref. 4). Finally, the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690) authorizes the use of certain fundsfor data collection, and requires an evaluation of treatment program quality.These various sources have all clearly recognized the need for monitoringand evaluating treatment programs to improve the quality of care.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. A Pilot Study</ITAG>NIDA and FDA believe that before a full-scale effort to collect informationfor the evaluation of methadone treatment programs and the developmentof performance standards is initiated, a pilot study will be necessary.The pilot study will help to assess the appropriateness of the data andthe methodology used to collect that data. The appendix to this noticedetails a proposal for such a study. The agencies seek comments on thisapproach, names of treatment programs, and State and local agencies thatwould be interested in participating in the pilot study.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Request for Comments</ITAG>FDA and NIDA request comments on all aspects of this notice and on alternativemeans of achieving these objectives. The agencies are particularly interestedin data and information relevant to the following specific questions: 1. In developing a method for undertaking an ongoing treatment programevaluation, such as is being proposed, perhaps the most significant questionis what mechanism can be used to assure that there is a fair comparisonamong treatment programs. The agencies realize that treatment programsdo not necessarily serve the same types of individuals. Some programs mayadmit a large proportion of individuals who are unemployed, have littleeducation, have long histories of chronic drug use, and suffer from severephysical or psychiatric problems. In contrast, other programs may be selectiveand limit their admissions to individuals who have greater financial, social,and psychological assets. NIDA and FDA believe these concerns may be answeredby using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), developed by McClellan etal. (Ref. 5), as an admission diagnostic instrument to categorize programsinto one of several problem severity categories. (The ASI is discussedin the appendix to this notice.) However, the agencies also realize thatother important factors may involve matters such as program philosophiesand funding. In addition, programs themselves vary in terms of resourcesand staffing. Therefore, should programs be categorized based on theseparameters, the ASI, or should even other factors be used to categorizeprograms?2. Another significant question to which the agencies are soliciting opinionin what are the appropriate treatment measures that should be considered.NIDA and FDA believe that some important treatment performance measuresinclude illicit drug use, medication noncompliance, retention of patientsin treatment, and types of patient discharge; e.g., successful completionof treatment, left against advice of the program, or arrested. The agenciesare also seeking comments on how to measure patient movement between programsand/or recidivism. 3. The agencies also invite comments on whether the data should be requiredfor patients in comprehensive maintenance treatment only, or whether itwould also be useful and appropriate to require the same or some othertypes of data for patients in detoxification (both short-term and long-term)treatment, and for patients in interim-care treatment. The proposal forthe interim-care treatment modality is contained elsewhere in this issueof the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. 4. The agencies believe information to be collected should include reportingpositive urine test results for those drugs for which the methadone regulationcurrently requires testing; i.e., opiates, cocaine, barbiturates, and amphetamines,and negative results for methadone. The agencies are aware that some havequestioned the need to continue to test for amphetamines and barbiturates,arguing that there is no longer widespread abuse of these drugs among patientsin methadone treatment programs. Others have asserted that marijuana useand benzodiazepine abuse are more of a problem and testing should be requiredfor these substances. The agencies welcome any information including supportingdata addressing the need to maintain or change the drugs for which testingis required. 5. Related questions with regard to urine testing are which analyticaltest procedures should be used and the laboratories that should performthe tests. The agencies recommend only using urine test results obtainedby the immunoassay procedure when measuring drug use. This method was chosenbecause many programs now use this method, and, for comparison purposes,it is important that the test procedures be consistent. More specificityis obtained by using chromatographic test methods. However, some methods,e.g., gas chromatography/mass spectrometry which is now required as theconfirmatory test procedure to be used in the Federal workplace drug testingprograms (Ref. 6), are more expensive to perform than the immunoassay.Comments are requested on the adequacy of the immunoassay method for thispurpose or, in the alternative, whether a chromatographic procedure shouldbe required instead of the immunoassay, or in addition to the immunoassay,as a confirmation test. With regard to which laboratories should performthe testing, the pilot study proposes that urine testing be performed bythose laboratories which currently perform the analytical testing or treatmentprograms. The agencies solicit comments on the adequacy of this procedureor whether the urine specimens should be sent to designated laboratoriesto assure uniform proficiency testing.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

Overview To develop appropriate performance standards, extensive data on treatmentpopulations, treatment characteristics, and patient outcomes need to begathered. NIDA and FDA have developed a draft proposal for a pilot studyon methadone treatment program effectiveness. Under the proposal a representativesample of treatment programs would voluntarily join in an effort to collectneeded data. Under this voluntary pilot study methadone treatment programswould submit demographic and diagnostic data on every patient currentlyin treatment and every new admission. These data would be used to categorizeprograms along a continuum of patient problem severity. Quarterly, eachprogram would collect urine specimens following a standardized procedureand submit the results along with patient discharge data to NIDA.The aggregate results of the urine tests as well as patient retention rates(for each patient problem severity category) would be compiled quarterlyby NIDA and would serve as a benchmark against which programs may be compared.B. Admission Data The agencies are considering to propose that the ASI be used as the admissiondiagnostic instrument. The ASI is a structured, 45-minute interview thatassesses patient problems in seven areas: medical condition, psychiatriccondition, drug use, alcohol use, family relations, employment, and illegalactivity. The interview necessary to complete the ASI can be given by atrained technician. The ASI has the advantage of covering a range of problemscommonly manifested in drug abusers, having a standardized content andevaluation method, and demonstrated reliability and validity. The instrumentpermits reporting objective data on the number, intensity, and durationof problem symptoms; subjective information based upon the interviewee'srating of the severity of his or her problems and need for treatment; theinterviewer's estimate of problem severity; and a composite score. NIDA and FDA believe that the ASI would be the most appropriate instrumentfor providing admission information for several reasons. First, most treatmentprogram personnel are familiar with the ASI, since it has been used forover 10 years. Moreover, it is estimated that almost half of the treatmentprograms use the ASI as an admission interview, including those programsadministered by the Veterans' Administration. In addition, some Statesalready require the ASI as part of the admission process. C. Problem Severity Category Each program would be placed into one of several program categories onthe basis of the types of patients in treatment during a reporting period.The categories would be a composite of the seven ASI factors. The categorieswould ensure that only programs with like characteristics in terms of severityof client problems are compared. D. Urine Tests Each day, except Sunday, a random sample of treatment programs would beselected to collect urine specimens. The sampling would be designed toensure that each program is selected once each quarter. NIDA would notifya selected program, no earlier than 24 hours before the program opens forbusiness, that urine must be collected that day. Selected programs wouldcollect specimens on every patient seen that day prior to the administrationof methadone. Each program would assure that appropriate chain-of-custodyprocedures are used for urine collection to minimize falsification andcollection errors. The program would send the urine specimens to a laboratorywhich is in compliance with all Federal proficiency testing and licensingstandards. The laboratory would perform an immunoassay on all specimensto determine the presence of opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates,and methadone. Unannounced on-site audits, including urine collection,may be performed from time-to-time to assess validity in reporting andin collecting urine specimens. E. Initial Treatment Program Submission Initially, those participating treatment programs would submit the followinginformation: (1) A list of all patients in maintenance treatment, identifiedby number only; (2) the date of admission for each patient; (3) methadonedose of each patient; (4) number of take-home doses of methadone, if any,that each patient receives; (5) other treatment services, e.g., counseling,rehabilitative, vocational, or educational services, each patient is receiving;and (6) a copy of the results of the ASI administered to each patient.F. Quarterly Treatment Program Log On the urine collection day, the program would complete a quarterly logcontaining the following information: (1) All active patient identificationnumbers; (2) patients scheduled to be seen that day; (3) patients fromwhom urine specimens were collected; (4) patients discharged since thelast reporting period, and the date and reason for discharge; (5) methadonedose by patient; and (6) number of take-home doses of methadone, if any,that each patient receives. Programs would submit their quarterly logs and the results of the urinetests within 21 days of the urine collection date. Admission information on patients who have entered into treatment sincethe last reporting date would be submitted with the quarterly log. G. Quarterly Report Each quarter, NIDA would tabulate the urine test and retention data intwo formats. The first format would present urine test and retention resultsfor the previous eight reporting quarters for programs falling into eachof the several problem severity categories. The measures to be reportedwould include, at a minimum: <T3>Drug use: </T3>The percentage of collected urine specimens found positivefor each illicit drug or found negative for methadone; <T3>Retention: </T3>The average length of time active patients have beenin treatment; <T3>Participating patients: </T3>The number and percentage of active patientson whom urine tests were collected; <T3>Discharge: </T3>The percentage of patients who were discharged fromthe program each quarter reported by type of discharge (successfully completedtreatment, left against program advice, transferred to another program,died, arrested, etc.). The second format would also present the urine and retention results byproblem severity category, but it would aggregate the data by length oftime in treatment rather than by calendar period. For this purpose, patientswould be compared by weekly cohorts; i.e., each cohort of patients wouldconsist of those patients first admitted to treatment during any 1 week.The following measures would be reported: <T3>Drug use: </T3>The percentage of the cohort of patients in each weekof treatment (up to the 104th week) whose urine specimens were found tobe positive for each illicit drug or negative for methadone; <T3>Retention: </T3>The percentage of the cohort of patients that actuallyremain in treatment; <T3>Participating patients: </T3>The number and percentage of active patientsin a given week of treatment from whom urine tests were collected. In addition to this information, from time-to-time other parameters mightbe included in the quarterly reports or in special reports. Each participatingtreatment program would be provided with results for the patients in itsprogram. H. Patient Confidentiality In order to comply with the Federal regulation relating to confidentialityof patient records (42 CFR Part 2), programs would supply data relatingto patient enrollment, urine test results and discharge data, by patientidentification number only. I. Cost The pilot study would be funded by NIDA and operated by an independentcontractor. Nonetheless, the agencies are particularly interested in commentsfrom treatment programs and other interested parties concerning the anticipatedcosts that would be incurred with these data collection and reporting proceduresand recommendations for mechanisms that might be implemented to maximizecost-effectiveness. Interested persons may, on or before May 1, 1989, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments regarding this advancenotice of proposed rulemaking. Three copies of any comments are to be submitted,except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identifiedwith the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4p.m., Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="6">Charles R.
