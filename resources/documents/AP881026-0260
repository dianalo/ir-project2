Wang, who had held a promising junior analyst job at MorganStanley andamp; Co., pleaded guilty last month to fraud for conspiringwith Taiwanese businessman Fred C. Lee to profit in the stock marketon secrets about impending corporate takeovers that Wang stole fromthe firm.   He also pleaded guilty to a separate but much smaller insidertrading scheme involving another person, whom prosecutors havedeclined so far to identify.   Wang and Lee were first exposed in late June by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, which said Lee made about $19 million inillicit profits and paid Wang $200,000 for tips provided betweenJuly 1987 and last April.   Morgan Stanley, which was deeply embarrassed and dismissed Wangimmediately, said through spokesman Peter Roche that ``We're pleasedjustice has been served.''   Lee's U.S. lawyer, James Morton, did not return telephone callsfor comment. Lee hasn't been charged with any crime and is believedto be living in Hong Kong.   The SEC has won court orders freezing the U.S. assets of Wang andLee and is seeking return of the $19 million plus triple damages fora total of $76 million, making it the second-biggest insider tradingscam behind the Ivan Boesky scandal.   A renowned stock speculator, Boesky paid the SEC a record $100million in November 1986 to settle insider trading charges, astunning episode that signaled a government crackdown on Wall Streetcrime. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment for conspiracyto lie to the enforcement agency.   The Wang-Lee case received widespread attention not only becauseof the amount of money involved, but because both men presumablywere brazenly trading on inside information at the height of concernabout the Boesky affair. Many law enforcers said this showed insidertrading remains a deep-rooted problem.   Wang could have been sentenced to five years imprisonment and a$250,000 fine for each of three counts against him. But Duffy, aformer SEC regional administrator, said he wasn't imposing a finebecause Wang had no money.   ``As far as I can figure out, you're worth zero,'' the judgesaid. ``Therefore any punishment at all has to be in the area ofimprisonment.''   Duffy did not explain the rationale for the three-year sentence,which also includes three years probation. But he lectured Wang onwhat the judge called inexcusable acts by a young man who grew up incomfortable surroundings, enjoyed a good education and was en routeto a successful career.   ``You did have practically every break society could give you,''said the judge, but ``apparently the first time you could have beena crook, you were.''   Wang, wearing a gray suit and dark tie, fidgeted nervously beforeDuffy pronounced the sentence and stood motionless while the judgespoke. Aside from a few reporters and bystanders, the courtroom wasempty.   ``I'm deeply sorry for what I've done,'' Wang told the judge.``I've incurred a lot of debts and losses of other people. I'm goingto try to make amends for it.''   Duffy gave Wang a month to settle his affairs before reporting tothe federal Bureau of Prisons. His lawyer, Ira L. Sorkin, said hewould try to have Wang placed in a facility near his family, wholive in the Chicago area.   Sorkin, who like Duffy is a former regional SEC administrator,declined to comment on the sentence. Assistant U.S. Attorney John M.McEnany, who represented the government in the case, also declinedto comment.   Wang grew up in Arlington Heights, Ill., attended the Universityof Illinois and landed a coveted junior analyst job at MorganStanley in June 1986. As a student, he excelled in economics and wasconsidered an aspiring entrepreneur because he had started his ownresume advisory service.   The local newspaper, which published an admiring story aboutWang's business talents, quoted him as saying that ``if you lovewhat you do, money comes along with it.''</TEXT></DOC>
