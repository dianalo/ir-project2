Characteristics of a proposed high-powerpulse energy system, formed by combining a recently developed, high-energydensity capacitor with various batteries were investigated. Main advantagesof the system thus far appear to be high power and pulse energy densityand flexibility in energy outputs. Parametric relationships between mostkey design variables, such as average pulse power, system output voltages,load impedance, pulse width, pulse frequency, duty cycle and battery'svoltage and current limits were established. Projections of the system'sweights in large scale applications suggested that the lithium/SO{sub2} battery considered might be too heavy when high duty cycles were required.However, significant weight reductions could be foreseen with properselection of the battery and further advances in the capacitor technology.</TEXT></DOC>
