The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which was up 1/2point for most of the day, slipped late in the day and endedless than 1/8 point higher, or about $1.25 for a bond with a$1,000 face amount.</LP><TEXT>   Prices of tax-exempt municipal bonds, investment-gradecorporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities followedTreasurys. Only junk bonds, which tend to take their cuesfrom the stock market, held on to strong gains throughout theday.   Steve Ricchuito, a financial economist at Barclays DeZoete Wedd Securities, said the Treasury bond market changedcourse just as it became apparent that the Dow JonesIndustrial Average would close above the technically andpsychologically important 3000 level. The Dow ended at3004.46, a record high.   &quot;People looked at it in terms of an asset-allocationplay,&quot; said Mr. Ricchuito. He said that fixed-incomeinvestors worried that the fanfare surrounding the Dowhitting its new high will draw more attention to the stockmarket and away from bonds. As a result, &quot;some of the cashthat would normally go into bonds, now might go into stocks,&quot;he said.   That's not an encouraging prospect for the bond market ata time when the Treasury is scheduled to sell a massiveamount of new debt. The government will auction $21 billionin short-term notes next week and is expected to auction morethan $30 billion of securities next month at the quarterlyrefunding of the federal debt.   Investor concerns about the market's ability to absorbthat debt also took some of the steam out of the bond marketyesterday.   In early trading, bond prices shot up shortly aftercomments attributed to Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan were reported on news wires. Mr. Greenspan,speaking at an off-the-record forum sponsored by columnistsRoland Evans and Robert Novak, reiterated what he has said inrecent congressional testimony -- that he still expects theU.S. economy to perk up in the coming months though sometrouble spots remain, according to those present. Mr.Greenspan was also reported to have said that he expectsinflation to ratchet down by one percentage point, althoughhe gave no specific time frame.   Lawrence Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg andamp;Co., said that Mr. Greenspan's remarks along with recentindications that the Fed does not plan to reduce interestrates any further at this time, bolstered long-term bonds.   &quot;This {Fed} policy is great because it means that the Fedwon't overstimulate the economy and that inflation will becoming down,&quot; said Mr. Leuzzi.   Some analysts said the prospects of economic damagestemming from yesterday's nationwide rail workers' strikelent a bullish tint to the market. However, some analystsbelieve the strike could have more of a negative, rather thanpositive, effect on bonds.   In addition to the Dow hitting 3,000, bonds were hurt latein the day by the Treasury's announcement that it isincreasing the size of its monthly two-year and five-yearnote auctions $500 million each from last month's portions.   The Treasury plans to sell $12 billion of two-year notesnext Wednesday and $9 billion of five-year notes nextThursday.   In when-issued trading, the two-year notes are quoted at ayield of 6.91% and the five-year notes are quoted at a yieldof 7.65%.   The increase in the auction size was a mild surprise.Analysts had generally expected the Treasury to keep itscoupon auctions at the same level for the time being, butsuspected an increase might be coming because the Treasuryannounced Tuesday it was raising the amount of its weeklybill auctions to $15.2 billion next week from $14.4 billionthis week.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended narrowly mixed in another day of lighttrading as long-term bonds rose and short-term securitiesended unchanged to slightly lower.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at 97 10/32 toyield 8.10%, compared with 97 7/32 to yield 8.11%.   But the price of the latest three-year note slipped to 9910/32 to yield 7.12% from 99 11/32 to yield 7.11% on Tuesday.   Rates on Treasury bills were lower. The discount rate onthree month bills declined to 5.56% from 5.60% while thebond-equivalent yield eased to 5.71% from 5.75%. The discountrate on six-month bills ended at 5.63% from 5.67% while theyield slid to 5.87% from 5.91%.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Junk bonds advanced as strength in stocks carried themarket higher for the second straight day. Prices of mosthighyield high-risk bonds finished with gains of 1/2 point asthe stock market forged ahead.   But the junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.bucked the trend, slipping on news that General Cinema Corp.has failed to reach an agreement with Harcourt bondholders.   General Cinema offered to buy the Harcourt bonds at apremium to their trading levels as part of a $1.4 billion bidto acquire the publisher. Harcourt's 13% senior notes, due in1997, slid 1/2 point to 89 1/2 while the company's 13.75%senior subordinated debentures, maturing in 1999, skidded 11/2 points to 71 1/2.   Some Harcourt bonds fell as much as 5 points when the newswas first announced, but then rebounded as investors began tobelieve that the deal may still be saved.   Meanwhile, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s $750 million issueof seven-year senior notes, which was expected to be pricedyesterday, will be launched today, according to peoplefamiliar with the transaction.   Underwriters yesterday morning were waiting for approvalfrom the Securities and Exchange Commission before launchingthe issue. Although some traders said they believed theoffering was cleared by the SEC late yesterday, underwriterschose to launch the issue today rather than late yesterday.   Market expectations are for the notes to be priced with ayield ranging from 10.40% to 10.60%. There is widespreadspeculation, however, that when the deal is launched, it willbe expanded to $1 billion or more.   In the secondary market, RJR Nabisco's zero-coupon bondsrose one point to 75 while the company's 15% pay-in-kindbonds, which pay interest in the form of additionalsecurities, edged 1/4 point higher to 121.                                                                                                          Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Denver airport bonds continued their strong recentperformance as investors sought the high yields on theissues.   The bonds, which offer some of the highest yields oninvestment-grade municipals, finished as much as 7/8 pointhigher on the day, outpacing the general market, where pricesgained 1/8 to 1/4 point.   Among active secondary issues, the New York LocalGovernment Assistance Corp.'s 7% securities of 2016 were up1/4 point, at 97 1/8, to yield 6.90%.   The recently issued Denver airport 8.75% securities of2023 were 7/8 point higher on the day at 98, to yield 8.92%.   Since the bonds for the controversial airport were sold onApril 9, the price of the benchmark 8.75% issue has climbed 21/2 points and the yield has fallen more than 0.25 percentagepoint.   Even with the price gains, the bonds yield about twopercentage points more than top-grade muni issues. This yieldadvantage has helped spur investor demand, traders say.   Meanwhile, New York City's growing fiscal problems droppedprices on the city's general obligation bonds about 3/8 pointyesterday.   Traders quoted long-term New York City general obligationbonds maturing in 20 years as yielding about 8.20%. The yieldon the bonds is about 0.05 percentage point higher thanlevels seen late Tuesday.   The bonds have been hurt by recent news reports about thecity's troubled finances, traders say.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage-securities prices ended 3/32 to 6/32 higher,boosted by collateral purchases for real estate mortgageinvestment conduit deals and some talk that April prepaymentsmight not be as strong as early estimates.   For high-coupon mortgage-securities investors, unexpectedprepayments cut yields. Mortgage securities payments spikedup in March and were expected to be up sharply again inApril. The steep increases in prepayments last month werecaused mainly by a modest upturn from the lowest mortgagerates in four years. But now there is sentiment thatprepayments will not surge again this month.   Among active secondary issues, Government NationalMortgage Association 8.5% securities for May delivery were up6/32 on the day at 97 28/32 to yield 8.92%. Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp. 8.5% securities were up 3/32 at 97 18/32 andFederal National Mortgage Association 8.5% securities were up3/32 at 97 9/32.   In primary activity, Prudential Securities Inc. announceda $375 million Remic deal, series PS-15, backed by Ginnie Mae10% securities; Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. announced a $300.15million Remic, series 1991-53, backed by Fannie Mae 9%securities, and Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. announced a $550.15million Remic, series 1991-54, backed by Fannie Mae 9%securities.   Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. announced a$250 million Fannie Mae deal, series G-12, backed by GinnieMae 10% securities.   Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          The Portuguese government's first bond offering this yearwas five times oversubscribed, as both domestic and foreigninvestors showed keen interest in the high-yield securities.   Portugal auctioned 30 billion Escudos ($208.6 million) of19.25% seven-year bonds and received bids totaling 152billion Escudos.   Although domestic investors were attracted to the highyield, analysts said that many foreign investors wereattracted by both yield and the opportunity to buy securitiesin a fledging market that is expected to outperform otherEuropean markets in the future. Some analysts compareinvesting in Portuguese bonds to investing in Spanish bonds acouple of years ago.   &quot;The Spanish effect is what turns people on,&quot; said StephenMajor, an international bond analyst at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew.   Investors in Spanish government bonds have reaped largereturns in the first quarter of this year as declines ininterest rates have pushed bond yields 2.30 percentage pointslower. Rates declined as Spanish inflation cooled.   Portugal's stubbornly high inflation is also expected toabate. And as with Spain, analysts expect Portugal's currencyto rally even before inflation improves. The Portugueseinflation rate declined steeply between 1984 and 1987 to 9.5%from 28%. But it climbed back to 13% in 1990 despite tightmonetary policies.</TEXT></DOC>
