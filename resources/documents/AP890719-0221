(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Louises were adamant. They had beenpunished for something that wasn't their fault.   ``You know how much I like bingo? This is my 40th weddinganniversary and I'm here and my husband's sitting at home,'' saidLouise Sharp, one of about 70 players at a reinstituted game run bythe Knoxville Association for the Blind.   ``If I do something, I can tell you in a split second if I'vesinned or not,'' said Louise McCall. ``I don't feel like I've sinnedwhen I play bingo.''   Until mid-June, the two bingo veterans had been denied theirfavorite pastime for more than three months. The game they attendedthis night was legal only because participants weren't required topay to play.   They and thousands like them are angry that their game of choicegot caught in a vise, at the same time robbing charities of a majorsource of income.   The state Alcoholic Beverage Commission suspended all bingolicenses March 9 after the state Supreme Court ruled the games arelotteries, which are banned by a section of the state constitutionthat's been on the books since 1835.   Before that, churches and other tax-exempt groups could play forcharity as long as they filed necessary paperwork. But unscrupulousoperators were taking advantage of the profit potential. In 1986,then-Attorney General Michael Cody said less than 2 percent of $44million in bingo proceeds went to charity.   Many players are going to games in neighboring states now thatthey can't play at home. A bingo operator in Bristol, Va., said thecrowds ``more or less doubled'' immediately after the ban went intoeffect. That has waned, he said, but several new bingo games havesprung up near the border.   Some Tennessee operators are taking a chance of their own byoffering free games they hope will skirt the gambling issue byrequesting donations.   Bingo fans who come to the Algood Rod and Gun Club across thestreet from the Algood Police Department about 75 miles east ofNashville are asked to give $20. Someone who didn't pay would bepointed out to other patrons, said owner Harold Chaffin. ``Theywould probably like to know who didn't give.''   The free games still give prizes, although the size is determinedby the generosity of donors. Attorney General Charles Burson saidlocal prosecutors would have to examine each operation to decidewhether to press charges.   Other groups are meeting the gambling issue head on.   The Benevolent Bingo Operators of Tennessee, mostly veteransgroups, spent over $25,000 lobbying for a constitutional conventionon lotteries. The effort went nowhere in the General Assembly, whichhas adjourned for the year.   One problem with amending the constitution is that by law,Tennessee can hold a constitutional convention only every six years.The state does not have an income tax, and tax reform of some sortis given priority by many government officials. They oppose aconvention just on gambling because it would delay a vote on anincome tax, and they are not ready for a tax reform convention.   The Bingo Operators asked the state's 750 registered charities tosupport the effort. Group President Jim Fuller, general manager ofAmerican Legion Post 43 in Tullahoma, said the ban would hurthundreds of legitimate charities.   ``It's put us in a bind we're trying to work around and recoverfrom,'' said the Rev. Thomas Kirk, rector of the Cathedral of theImmaculate Conception in Memphis. ``Some of our schools were hitharder than others.''   The school at his church derived up to $40,000 a year from bingo,Kirk said. ``To this point we've been able to operate on a surpluswe had available, but we will have to have fund-raisers of otherkinds.''   St. Michael's Catholic Church in Memphis averaged about $30,000 ayear, said business manager Diane Harder. ``We're looking for otherways to raise that money. Right now the projection is that not onealternative will handle it. It will probably have to come throughseveral fund-raising projects.''   At St. Patrick's Catholic Church, 50 miles west of Nashville inMcKuen, organizers of what is billed as the world's largest barbecueplanned a variety of fund-raisers in hopes of making up for lostbingo revenue. But they said the 135-year-old, late-July picnic,which drew 20,000 people last year, would likely take in only abouthalf its normal amount.   The Fraternal Order of Police lodge in Bristol was raising about$8,000 a month through bingo for volunteer fire departments andrescue squads, said Kent Bradford, former manager. ``We gave $1,000each to 10 different organizations in January. We spent about$10,000 on the Christmas fund for food baskets, a Santa Claus,dinner and so forth.''   Since the ban, the FOP has ``lost our building, which was ourmeeting place,'' Bradford said. ``We lost everything we could do asa charitable organization. We just lost it all.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs, July 24</NOTE></DOC>
