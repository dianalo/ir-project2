The system is basedon an 'electronic ear' consisting of a microphone with a special electroniccircuit which converts the noise from the ball mill, at a specially selectedfrequency, into an electrical signal. This signal is displayed on a meterand is also used to control the feed to the ball mill. Use of the systemhas resulted in greater automation, greater uniformity of the groundore and reduced abrasion of the steel balls and of the mill. (author).11 figs, 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
