But George Bush is a Velcro candidate who seems unable to shake questions about the Iran-Contra scandal.    In recent weeks, bits and pieces of new information have underscored the fact that Vice President Bush was fully aware that the administration was secretly selling arms to Iran and that, while he did express some objections, his voice wasn't strong enough to make a difference. Perhaps more troubling, questions linger about how he could have remained ignorant of covert arms shipments to Nicaragua's Contra rebels when, through his aides, he had ties to figures in the arms network.    The issue arose again at a Republican debate in New Hampshire this weekend. The vice president defended his actions, saying he opposed trading arms for hostages. When a rival, Pierre du Pont, pointedly told him that &quot;selling arms to Iranian moderates is dumb and nutty,&quot; Mr. Bush defended the notion of seeking an opening with Iranian moderates. He contended that the issue was a product of the media's &quot;fascination&quot; and that other Americans don't care about it.    But a new NBC News poll of likely Republican voters in Iowa indicates that almost half of the voters in that state think Mr. Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair may be a factor in their decision on whom to support. And by a 52% to 30% margin, those Iowa Republicans said they don't think Mr. Bush has given a full accounting of his role.    Both the NBC poll and a Des Moines Register survey released yesterday show Sen. Dole with a large and widening lead among likely voters in the Iowa Republican caucuses. The Register poll shows Mr. Dole ahead, 41% to 26%, compared with the edge of only four points he held in a similar survey less than a month earlier.    And despite the vice president's contention that the Iran-Contra scandal won't be a big issue in the general election, some political experts see it as potentially harmful to him. &quot;In my book, this is a man who was a former CIA director,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a respected political analyst. &quot;He's not some innocent who was in there listening to all this stuff who doesn't know how they knit together. So I just sort of wonder whether the whole truth is out on the table on that, and I think . . . the Democrats can make a big issue out of that.&quot;    In any event, the issue keeps popping up, most recently because snippets of new information have emerged. Recently, the congressional committees that investigated the Iran-Contra affair made public a computer message in which former National Security Adviser John Poindexter called Mr. Bush's support for the Iran arms sales &quot;solid.&quot;    In another message from the National Security Council's computer system, which was released last spring but which only recently began attracting attention, Adm. Poindexter said the vice president was seeking to postpone former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane's secret trip to Tehran until Mr. Bush had ended a visit to Saudi Arabia.    Mr. Bush hasn't denied knowing about the Iran arms sales, but he has long insisted that he privately expressed reservations about the secret policy. That contention has been bolstered in recent days by former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who says he agrees that the vice president several times voiced his misgivings about the Iran arms sales.    Still, there are lingering doubts about the vigor of Mr. Bush's opposition. Though Mr. Regan now corroborates Mr. Bush's position, the former chief of staff never previously made a point of defending the vice president during months of detailed investigations. The congressional panels investigating the Iran-Contra affair, after hearing extensive testimony from Mr. Regan and others, concluded that Mr. Bush &quot;attended several meetings on the Iran initiative, but none of the participants could recall his views.&quot;    And after the secret arms sales were exposed by a Lebanese magazine in November 1986, Adm. Poindexter rejected a suggestion from Secretary of State George Shultz that the administration should &quot;give the key facts to the public.&quot;    &quot;I do not believe that now is the time to give the facts to the public,&quot; Adm. Poindexter replied in a message to Mr. Shultz, adding that: &quot;Today, I have talked with the vice president, (then Defense Secretary Caspar) Weinberger, and (the late CIA Director William) Casey and they agree with my approach.&quot;    It is even less clear how Mr. Bush could have been as ignorant as he claims of the role that Oliver North, the fired National Security Council aide, played in arming and directing the Contras during the period when Congress had barred such official U.S. aid to the rebels. Mr. Bush has taken a keen interest in Central American policy, has traveled to the area a number of times, and, through one of his sons, has links to the Cuban anti-communist community in southern Florida.    Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Donald Gregg, a career CIA officer, is a former associate and close friend of Felix Rodriguez, a Cuban-born specialist in paramilitary operations who went to work for Col. North's Contra aid network in El Salvador in 1985. A memo from Mr. Gregg, reported last week by U.S. News and World Report, indicates that as early as 1983, the vice president's national security adviser was promoting a plan drawn up by Mr. Rodriguez that called for the U.S. to assist in mounting air strikes against leftist rebels in Central America.    Mr. Gregg has acknowledged that in August 1986, Mr. Rodriguez complained to him that the secret Contra aid operation was delivering shoddy goods to the rebels and charging them inflated prices. Two months later, when a plane carrying arms to the Contras was shot down over Nicaragua, an operative in the secret Contra aid network immediately flashed the bad news to Lt. Col. Sam Watson, Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser. Then, in a 1986 interview with the CBS News program &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; the lone survivor of the crash, cargo handler Eugene Hasenfus, claimed that Mr. Bush was aware of the secret supply flights.    According to investigators, Mr. Bush met at least three times with Mr. Rodriguez, including a very brief encounter during a Cuban independence day reception in Miami. But the vice president has said that he &quot;never, ever had a discussion&quot; with him about the Contras and has flatly denied he knew about the Contra arms network.    Still, questions are likely to keep arising. Only last month Mr. Bush stunned guests at his annual Christmas party by inviting Adm. Poindexter and Col. North. The move may have seemed like good politics at the time, because it showed Mr. Bush wouldn't abandon the two former officials when they were under seige, but as the campaign wears on he may yet have second thoughts about it.    ---   'Do you think George Bush has given a full accounting of his role in the Iran-Contra affair, or don't you think so?'
