Humphrey, was sentenced to nearly fouryears in prison today and ordered to pay back insurance companies hewas found guilty of defrauding.   ``I just want to express to my family and friends my sincereapologies for all the pain and suffering I have caused them,''Solomonson told U.S. District Court Judge Edward Devitt beforesentencing. ``I'm an honest man, a loyal man and I never intended tocause harm to them.''   Solomonson, 47, was convicted in December on nine counts offraud. Prosecution witnesses testified he diverted more than $1.5million from his two Edina insurance agencies to his personal use.   The jury found that he altered company books to hide the illegaltransactions. He was found guilty of one count of bank fraud andeight counts of mail fraud.   Devitt ordered Solomonson to pay $616,761 as full restitution toseven insurance companies which Devitt said ``are victims ofdefendant's crimes.'' Solomonson brokered insurance for the sevencompanies. In addition to the money taken from the insurancecompanies, he was convicted of taking money from the partners in hisinsurance agencies.   Devitt sentenced Solomonson to 46 months on each of the ninecounts, but ordered that they be served concurrently. He alsoimposed five years' probation, and said Solomonson won't be eligiblefor probation unless he complies with the restitution order.   Solomonson's wife, the former Nancy Humphrey, and hismother-in-law, Muriel Humphrey Brown, and other family membersattended the sentencing hearing. The late Hubert Humphrey, alongtime Democratic U.S. senator as well as vice president underLyndon Johnson, died in 1978.   Assistant U.S. District Attorney Henry Shea asked for a stiffsentence, but did not specify the length of sentence he desired.</TEXT></DOC>
