Kohl was kicking off a conservative alliance's campaign for EastGermany's March 18 elections, the country's first free vote after40 years of Communist rule.   But West German politicians, who themselves face the voters inDecember, are increasingly using East Germany's election campaignto promote themselves and their causes.   Meanwhile, East Germany's deputy defense minister and chief ofstaff said today the two countries' armed forces should merge andbe deployed on the entire territory of a reunited Germany.   ``Every sovereign state has the right to defend itssovereignty,'' Manfred Graetz told the East German newspaper JungeWelt. ``There are also neutral states that have armed forces. Ibelieve that a future Germany must be allowed this right.''   Graetz also rejected extending NATO's territory over what is nowEast Germany, but said he did not believe it could become a ``noman's land.''   His remarks could further complicate discussions over themilitary role for a united Germany. East Germany and the SovietUnion have insisted that the future state be neutral.   West Germany and its Western allies want the country to remainin NATO. The West German government has said no NATO or Germantroops should be stationed in what is now East Germany.   On Tuesday, most of the 90,000 people who crowded in front ofErfurt's cathedral for Kohl's speech chanted ``Helmut! Helmut!''and ``Our Chancellor!'' Many waved West German flags.   ``There are fears in East and West of a Germany that would have80 million inhabitants ... (and) be a tremendous economic force,''Kohl said.   He also observed that a reunited Germany ``will have to livewith its past, with the horrors that were committed in the name ofGermany this century'' and noted fears that it could again threatenits neighbors.   ``I take these fears seriously. ... Peace will emanate fromGerman soil,'' he said. Germans have been seeking to assure theirEuropean neighbors and the world that a unified Germany will notpose a military threat.   In Moscow, Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed an international treatyon Germany reunification, saying his country ``has an inalienableright'' to ensure that it does not sustain moral, political oreconomic damage from a united Germany.   In an interview published in the Communist Party newspaperPravda today, Gorbachev said a united Germany must respect Europe'scurrent borders and only the four victorious Allies of World War IIcan determine Germany's final status.   Both Germanys are bound by treaties to respect their currentfrontiers, but a united country would not be, and someconservatives in West Germany have suggested reunification besought within the 1937 borders.   In 1937, one-third of what is now Poland was German territory.   Kohl said he would seek massive investment by West German firmsand extend Bonn's social security safety net to offset the economicchaos caused by what he called ``40 years of red dictatorship'' inEast Germany.   ``We have created in the Federal Republic (West Germany) asocial security system that is exemplary in Europe,'' Kohl said.``We want this system for people in East Germany as well.''   Specifically, he promised East Germans that they could draw thesame unemployment benefits as West Germans after reunificiation andsaid East Germans would get adequate pensions.   Retirees would also see the value of their savings protected.   Kohl was campaigning for the Alliance of Germany, which includesthe East German branch of Kohl's Christian Democrats as well as theDemocratic Awakening and the German Social Union parties.   The coalition, which polls show running behind the SocialDemocratic Party, is one of the most outspoken champions of Germanunification.   Kohl was repeatedly jeered by about 100 hecklers waving EastGerman flags, and several anti-Kohl posters, apparently printed byleft-wing groups, were pasted up in the city.   But cheering broke out for minutes after Kohl's hourlong speech,forcing him to appear several times at an open window overlookingCathedral Square.   ``Nothing better could have happened,'' retiree Hans Wagner saidfrom the square.</TEXT></DOC>
