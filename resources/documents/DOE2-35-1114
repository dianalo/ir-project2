Therefore a conservative methodhas been developed for load modulation simulation. Fuel management, reactorcontrol and load modulation neutronical calculations are first carriedout. Based on these hypotheses, fuel thermomechanical studies yield themaximum values of criterion-limited parameters. For example, in the caseof 3,7% enriched fuel operating for 3 cycles, the rod pressure does notexceed 150 bar (155 bar for external coolant pressure); cladding fatiguedamage remains in the 30-40% range. For 3,7% Fragema fuel management(900 MWe units), after an initial 75-day period (first cycle excluded),an initial ''credit'' of 66 days is available, decreasing or being restoredaccording to unit power level. Equivalent specifications have to be establishedfor other fuel designs and other plant series (M3, 1300 MWe units, etc...).New fuel designs and/or new fuel managements will be also treated. Correspondingfuel studies will be improved, especially with experimental programscontribution. 2 refs, 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
