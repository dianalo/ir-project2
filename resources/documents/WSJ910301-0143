Its offense? Shell continues to operatein South Africa and is the subject of a boycott by the UnitedMine Workers of America. The UMW brands Shell &quot;the worstcorporate collaborator with the apartheid regime.&quot; It nowturns out that the African National Congress is itself happyto deal with Shell. Last week, the ANC announced it wasbuying Shell House, the company's 20-story building inJohannesburg, as its headquarters. Shell will receive $8million from the sale. Will Governor Florio now ban the ANCfrom New Jersey for its &quot;collaboration&quot; with Shell?</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
