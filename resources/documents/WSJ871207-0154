KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABOR SPPPULP, PAPER, PACKAGING (ALL TYPES) (PUL)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scott Paper Co. agreed to pay $475,000 in fines to settle Labor Department charges of job-safety and record-keeping violations at the company's Winslow, Maine, manufacturing plant.    The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it served citations on Scott early last week, alleging 121 safety violations, including two willful violations, at the plant. The charges concerned alleged electrical hazards, faulty scaffolding, inadequate machine guards, and an unguarded floor opening.    In September, OSHA proposed penalties of $813,000 against the company on charges of willfully underreporting injuries at the plant, which produces sanitary paper for facial and toilet tissue. At that time, OSHA said the plant underreported such injuries as fractures, back injuries, hernias, strains and sprains, and charged 203 willful record-keeping violations. The agency also said it was conducting a full safety and health inspection at the Winslow plant.    OSHA defines a willful violation as one in which an employer knew about workplace health or safety conditions or about reporting inadequacies that don't meet federal requirements, or was aware of a hazardous condition but didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    In the agreement, Scott didn't admit any guilt regarding the safety or reporting charges, but agreed to try to resolve the safety citations, while reserving the right to contest the agency's characterization of the seriousness of any disputed safety charge before an independent federal review commission, OSHA said. The company also agreed to correct record-keeping discrepancies companywide, back to January 1986.    A spokesman for Philadelphia-based Scott said, &quot;Although we object to many of the individual record keeping and safety citations, we believe it's in the best interest of Scott and OSHA to resolve both citations amicably and expediently. Scott remains committed to ensuring the safety of our employees at all our operations.&quot;    OSHA said its findings in the record-keeping investigation prompted the agency to turn to and subsequently pinpoint substantive safety problems.    OSHA has concentrated mainly on paperwork violations while boosting its enforcement efforts in the past 18 months. In recent months, OSHA has accepted sizable penalty payments from Union Carbide Corp., General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. to settle charges of record-keeping violations, and has proposed large fines against General Dynamics Corp., Caterpillar Inc., Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s IBP Inc. unit, and Bath Iron Works Corp.    Critics say the agency needs to do more directly to improve workplace health and safety, not just levy fines for reporting omissions. But OSHA officials insist they can't adequately deal with substantive worksite violations until they have full and accurate reporting by employers.    However, the National Research Council, a private organization, recently faulted OSHA for how it collects data on workplace injuries and illnesses, saying those methods aren't detailed enough to prevent the accidents and diseases. An OSHA spokesman has called the report a &quot;useful road map&quot; for collecting and studying the data, but also said it suggested &quot;an ideal world&quot; that ignores OSHA's financial and technological limitations, among others. </TEXT></DOC>
