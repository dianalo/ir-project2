John Bryant said Friday in asking the treasury secretary toinvestigate the proposed deal.   ``The enormity of this acquisition causes us to believe a secondlook should be taken at the matter, because of its possible impacton the domestic oil and gas industry and on our ability to becomeenergy independent,'' Bryant said.   Bryant, a Dallas Democrat, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, Sen.Jeff Bingamon, D-N.M., and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., appealed toTreasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to investigate the jointventure, named Star Enterprises, on national security grounds.   The Saudi-Texaco deal, announced Nov. 10, would include threerefineries, 50 distribution terminals, 1,400 service stations and10,000 franchised gasoline stations in 23 Eastern and Gulf Coaststates.   In their letter, the Democrats said they believe the acquisitionfalls under the law enabling the government to block mergersinvolving a foreign interests if there is evidence that nationalsecurity is threatened.   The acquisition, they wrote, could ``seriously increase U.S.dependence on foreign oil, threaten the viability of the domesticoil industry and jeopardize the well-being of American consumers.''   ``The lessons of the 1973-74 oil embargo and the 1978-79 shortagetaught our country all too well the economic and politicalconsequences of reliance on vulnerable oil supplies,'' the lettersaid.   ``What is particulary noteworthy is that 96 percent of thecapacity of the three refineries will be used in refining SaudiArabian crude oil,'' Bryant said. ``So you've got a circumstancethat Saudi Arabia has guaranteed itself an outlet for crude oil intothe American market, giving them the option of lowering crude priceswhile earning increased prices at the gasoline marketing level. Thiscould amount to an enormous loss to domestic producers and leave useven more dependent on foreigh oil.''   Also, he said, foreign countries are immune from our antitrustlaws, ``so it's not clear we could enforce antitrust laws againstthis merged entity if needed to do so to protect consumers frommarket manipulation.''   He said Saudi Arabia has announced a concerted effort to expandits dominance in U.S. oil markets and that its goal is to become the10th largest seller of gasoline in the United States as a first step.</TEXT></DOC>
