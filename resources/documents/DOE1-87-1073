<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-1073 </DOCNO><TEXT>A process is disclosed for the production of power, particularly in theform of electricity from a carbonaceous fuel which comprises partiallyoxidising the fuel with oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas to yield agas stream containing carbon monoxide at supra-atmospheric pressure,expanding the said gas stream to produce power, and substantially completelycombusting at least a major portion of the expanded stream with additionaloxygen or an oxygen-containing gas to produce additional power, characterisedin that, prior to expansion, the said gas stream is subjected to a carbonmonoxide shift reaction whereby at least some of the carbon monoxidetherein is converted into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. By using the process,greatly reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides can be achieved which willhelp reduce acid rain.</TEXT></DOC>
