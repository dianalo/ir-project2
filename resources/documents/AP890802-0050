(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After bracing for the worst, relatives ofhostage Joseph Cicippio said they hoped his two-day reprieve wouldlead to his release after three years in captivity.   ``For the next two days, we want to see what kind of movementstake place,'' said his brother, Thomas Cicippio. ``This is anopportunity for everyone to pull together, right now. We reallyneed this.''   Shiite Moslem extremists who have been holding Cicippio inLebanon threatened to kill him at 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday inretaliation for Israel's abduction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, areligious leader.   More than two hours after the deadline, they announced a 48-hourextension.   ``I am mentally and physically worn out and now we must endurethis for another two days. We are being held hostage, just like myfather,'' said one of Cicippio's sons, David, 27, an electronicstechnician from nearby North Wales.   Joseph Cicippio, 58, was acting comptroller at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut when he was kidnapped from the campus Sept.12, 1986.   The threat to kill Cicippio came shortly after another groupsaid Monday it had hanged hostage Lt. Col. William R. Higgins inretaliation for Obeid's abduction.   Tom Cicippio, 66, came out from his suburban Philadelphia houseseveral times Tuesday to answer questions from reporters. He calledthe extension ``good news for all of us.''   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-heldWestern hostage, agreed that the extension could improve thesituation.   ``I think the longer they talk, the longer they delay, thegreater the chances that we may turn this around and get them allhome,'' said Ms. Say in Nashville, Tenn.   Anderson, 41, was the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press when he was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.   Former hostage David Jacobsen said the Israeli action thatapparently led to the reported hanging of Higgins may have spoiledplans for Anderson's release. Jacobsen, speaking from his Coloradohome, said sources in London told him that Anderson was to be freedlast Saturday by the new Iranian government as a gesture of goodwill.   In Michigan, Virginia Rose Steen said she fears commenting onrecent developments while her husband, Alann, remains a hostage. Hewas kidnapped in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987.   ``It's not my place to say anything right now,'' she said Mondayafternoon outside her parents' Clark Lake home. ``We worry aboutall of the hostages constantly, 24 hours a day.''   Cicippio, Anderson and Steen are three of the eight Americansheld hostage in Lebanon.   Before hearing of Cicippio's extension, his brother stuck to hisbelief that diplomacy was the only way to free his brother.   ``I don't want to see any military action to try to rescue thehostages. That would seal their fate,'' Tom Cicippio said.   But two of Joseph Cicippio's sons said force shouldn't be ruledout.   ``It's time we took some kind of action. Who knows what kind ofthreats are going to be made in the next 48 hours? I have PresidentBush in my prayers and I pray that he makes the right choice,''David Cicippio said.   Asked about the prospects of military action, Joseph CicippioJr., said, ``I think it's probably going to come to that.Negotiations are best, but that's a last resort. If it comes tothat, at least we can say we tried,'' he said.   After his 20-year marriage broke up, Joseph Cicippio worked inSaudi Arabia and London before accepting the post in Beirut in1984. He remained close to his family in the United States, and theCicippios believed he was protected from kidnapping because heconverted to Islam and married a Lebanese woman.</TEXT></DOC>
