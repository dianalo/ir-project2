In a letter sent last week to UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, Mr. Davis also indicated he would consider raising his offer after a review of confidential UAL information. Mr. Davis and Mr. Wolf are said to have spoken briefly by telephone before the letter was sent.    The proposal, which remains just a letter without any known financing, is well above the current UAL stock price even after a powerful two-day rally in UAL shares. The stock rose $8.50 a share yesterday to close at $219.25, on top of a $46.25 gain Monday.    Though the UAL board, which is to meet this afternoon regarding Mr. Davis's proposal, may snub the offer because of its informal nature, there are indications some directors may eventually consider some kind of leveraged buy-out or other transaction.    Ralph Strangis, a Minneapolis attorney and UAL board member, said in an interview that he couldn't comment on the Davis offer or the board's possible response. But he said a management-led buy-out &quot;always surfaces as a possibility whenever this type of activity occurs.&quot;    Asked about carriers such as Trans World Airlines or Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. which have gone private, Mr. Strangis said &quot;privatization isn't necessarily a bad thing for an airline. It's less an issue of public vs. private. What's important is whether a transaction leaves the company with the ability to be competitive.&quot;    If the UAL board balks, some takeover stock traders believe Mr. Davis is willing to pursue a procedure known as a consent solicitation to oust the current board members. Mr. Davis briefly began a proxy fight for NWA last spring before the board put Northwest up for sale.    Since the Davis offer became known, UAL trading volume has totaled 3.9 million shares. The company has 21.6 million shares outstanding. An acquirer would have to buy 22.5 million UAL shares on a fully diluted basis, counting unexercised options.    The price of Mr. Davis's opening bid may be higher than expected because it approaches the $250-to-$300 range in which most analysts have valued UAL in a takeover in the two months since the price of the Northwest purchase became known. But some estimates run far higher.    A confidential study by Salomon Brothers Inc., a financial adviser to the UAL pilot union, estimated that the airline is worth $325 a share in a leveraged buyout, but only $285 a share in a recession scenario. The study, called &quot;Project Frequent Flyer,&quot; was obtained from market sources who asked to remain unidentified.    The Salomon study envisions piling $5.3 billion in new debt and $1.5 billion in equity on top of United's existing debt of $1.2 billion. It also outlines possible buy-outs of AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, at $130 a share; Delta Air Lines at $110 a share, and USAir Group Inc. at $75 a share.    Delta and AMR stock continued to surge yesterday on takeover speculation, with AMR up $2.375 a share to $73.875 and Delta rising $2.25 to $76.75. But USAir fell $1.625 to $51.375 because the airline announced after the market closed Monday that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. would buy 12%, complicating a hostile bid.    On the other hand, one of UAL's largest shareholders has been selling during the run-up in the stock price that began in June. Alliance Capital Management Inc., which earlier this year held nearly four million shares, has cut its stake by more than half in order to cash in on the gains, according to Alfred Harrison, an Alliance portfolio manager in Minneapolis.    Mr. Wolf and the UAL pilots, as well as the board, are expected to have a lot to say about who buys United. Mr. Davis and other bidders are likely to try to negotiate with both labor and management.    Whomever labor sides with could have an advantage in potential wage or profit-sharing concessions. But enlisting both labor and management in one bid could be difficult, particularly since the pilots have said they want to put together their own offer.    During the NWA takeover auction, the pilots never acted cohesively to influence the outcome. One reason was that, even three years after Northwest merged with Republic, the union was still divided into a Northwest faction and a Republic faction. However, the UAL pilots have shown they can act together.    Another reason cited for UAL's stock strength late Monday and yesterday is that Mr. Davis is working with David Batchelder, a La Jolla, Calif., merger adviser who formerly worked for corporate raider T. Boone Pickens.    Mr. Batchelder, who guided Mr. Davis during his pursuit of NWA, also did some consulting for the UAL pilots during their 1987 attempt to buy the airline. UAL is being advised by First Boston Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
