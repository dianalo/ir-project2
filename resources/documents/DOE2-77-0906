There wasa systematic decrease in the quiet sun's brightness temperature at 21cm as the sun declined from sunspot maximum to sunspot minimum; thiswas accompanied by a systematic decrease in the sun's radius. The two-folddecrease in the electron number density in the solar transition regionand low corona could have been the cause of these variations. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
