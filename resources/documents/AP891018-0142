Mitchell said it was ``most unfortunate'' that Bush hadcampaigned for the amendment and said the measure sought ``to forceAmericans to choose between the flag and the Constitution.''   ``Americans do revere the flag and they do revere theConstitution and they can do both,'' Mitchell said.   The Senate planned to vote on the amendment Thursday morning.   Critics say it would curb freedom of speech. Proponents call itthe only way to prevent recurrence of the Supreme Court ruling inJune that held existing law against flag burning unconstitutional.   Bush has been the most visible champion of the measure whileSenate Democrats have provided the bulk of the opposition. But twoformer Republican sponsors, Sens. John Danforth, R-Mo., and WarrenRudman, R-N.H., dropped their support on Tuesday because of themeasure's impact on the Bill of Rights.   The House last week approved and sent to Bush's desk a newapproach to ban flag burning by simple statute. It was carefullyworded in an effort to bring it into line with the Supreme Court'sruling.   Bush said that he would allow it to become law while continuingto press for the amendment.   Growing surer that they would prevail against the amendment,Democratic senators trooped to the floor to denounce it.   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said that Americans ``are notclamoring at us to amend the Constitution.''</TEXT></DOC>
