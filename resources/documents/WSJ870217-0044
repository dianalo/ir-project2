Garcia</HL><DD> 02/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   Wall Street chose to look at last week's insider-trading arrests through rose-colored glasses.    On Thursday, the day of the arrests, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost less than seven points. And after a hesitant start Friday, stock prices rallied in active trading as the industrials climbed 17.57 to close at 2183.35. The gain came in spite of a three-point drop in Texaco, one of the stocks that makes up the industrial average, on news that a Texas appeals court had affirmed more than $9 billion of a lower court's damage award of $11.1 billion to Pennzoil.    Why did stock prices rise amid such news?    Analysts and investors say the current market is very different from the one that was driven down last Nov. 14 by news that Ivan Boesky had agreed to pay $100 million to settle insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Back then, the market was posting meager gains with only a handful of issues leading the way. Money managers were intent on preserving profits from the first half's rally and didn't have great expectations for 1987. Many of the star performers then were rising on sometimes-flimsy speculation about takeovers or restructurings.    In the first two trading days after the Boesky announcement, the Dow Jones industrials lost more than 56 points. &quot;Deal&quot; stocks were hammered. During the five trading days after the announcement, a dozen of those stocks suffered declines valued at a total of more than $3 billion.    Now, in contrast, &quot;It's real investors, not the speculators, who are driving this market,&quot; John Connolly, a market strategist with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, says.    Although the current rally has driven the Dow Jones industrials up nearly 15% this year, Mr. Connolly says quite a few money managers are still eager to invest cash that has built up in their portfolios. Market declines, he says, now are broadly seen as buying signals for the cash-laden institutions.    The effect of the insider-trading scandal on acquisitions trading will be difficult to measure. The new tax law makes many acquisitions less attractive, which is why many that might have come during this quarter were speeded up and completed before that change took effect Jan. 1.    However, Brad Perry, chairman of David L. Babson andamp; Co. in Boston, says that an &quot;inability to misuse&quot; inside information in light of the federal crackdown on such activity might reduce the number of takeovers.    Many portfolio managers, including John M. Butler, president of Financial Programs Inc., a mutual-fund concern in Englewood, Colo., say the takeover game might be smaller in the future but perhaps also more equitable.    A few years ago, money managers zeroed in on often-ignored food companies such as General Foods and Nabisco, believing them undervalued and seeing tremendous asset value in their brand-name products. When the takeover plays began in this group, arbitragers took care of the undervaluation problem in short order. However, such managers now might have to be a little more patient with their &quot;ugly ducklings,&quot; market professionals suggest.    Still, investment bankers aren't expected to head for the unemployment offices anytime soon. The president of a major Wall Street investment banking house is said to have told money managers last week that the house had identified companies with a total of $17 billion available who are seriously looking for acquisition candidates.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The 17.57-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was mirrored in the broad market, with gainers outnumbering decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the New York Stock Exchange.    Broader market barometers, in fact, showed proportionately bigger gains than the blue-chip index. Market watchers usually expect the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index to gain one point for every seven points gained by the industrial average. But Friday, the Sandamp;P index rose 4.08 to 279.70, while the Big Board's composite index moved up 1.98 to 159.56.    Investors bid Pennzoil up 10 1/8 to 81 1/8 after the latest favorable ruling in its court battle with Texaco -- which closed at 35 1/2 after its three-point drop.    General Electric directors, a day after its Kidder Peabody unit was entangled in the widening insider-trading scandal, recommended a 2-for-1 stock split and agreed to consider a quarterly dividend increase at their May meeting. The stock rose 5 3/8 to 103 1/2 in active trading.    Broadcasting issues also were big winners. CBS rose 7 1/4 to 159 3/8. The stock was recommended earlier in the week by Edward Atorino of Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co., who said all the elements are in place for a &quot;dramatic earnings story.&quot; Capital Cities/ABC gained 9 1/2 to 322 1/2.    Drug, paper, forest products, chemical and some interest-sensitive stocks such as banks, thrifts and utilities saw renewed buying. Disappointing earnings news, meanwhile, dragged down Showboat, Handelman and Pannill Knitting. </TEXT></DOC>
