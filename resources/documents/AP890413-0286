Inc.   Chemical said the decline in its earnings reflected lowerprofits from foreign exchange and bond trading and the absence of asubstantial gain on the sale of investment securities reported inthe first quarter of 1988.   It said its net interest income and corporate finance fees werehigher and it had a lower provision for loan losses.   Chemical said it earned $117.9 million in the three months endedMarch 31, down from $125.5 million a year earlier. Earnings pershare fell even more steeply to $1.49 from $1.95, reflecting theissuance of 7 million shares in December 1988.   Net interest income rose 3.1 percent to $597.8 million,including $17.6 million in payments recognized from loans toBrazil. The 1988 figures included no interest income on Chemical'smedium and long-term loans to Brazil because Brazil had suspendedsuch payments from February 1987 through November 1988.   Securities trading profits fell 15 percent to $27.8 million inthe quartter and foreign exchange trading profits fell 21.5 percentto $27 million.   Chemical recorded a $600,000 loss on investment securities salesin the latest quarter, in contrast with a gain of $25.6 million ayear ago.   The results include operations of Horizon Bancorp of New Jersey,which was acquired in a merger Jan. 3. Horizon has been renamedChemical Bank New Jersey.   Chemical's assets amounted to $74 billion on March 31, down from$78.7 billion a year earlier, reflecting sale of some businessesthat no longer fit into its strategic direction.   Bank of New York, which became the nation's 10th largest bankingconcern with its acquisition late last year of Irving Bank Corp.,said its earnings rose to nearly $101.1 million in the firstquarter, up 86 percent from $54.4 million a year earlier. Earningsper share fell to $1.45 from $1.60, however, as the number ofshares outstanding nearly doubled due to the acquisition.   ``These results exceeded our plan, but they reflect only a smallpart of the cost savings arising from the merger,'' J. CarterBacot, chairman and chief executive, said. ``Further savings willbe realized as the year progresses.''   He said lending activities grew strongly, especially incommercial and industrial loans. Income from non-interestactivities including securities processing grew.   Bank of New York's assets climbed to $47.9 billion from $22.7billion before the merger.</TEXT></DOC>
