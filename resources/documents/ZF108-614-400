(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Do You Know What Your Money Is Doing?andM;Most financial experts recommend a portfolio of diversified investments tosustain asset growth and minimize the damage from unexpected losses.andP;  But aportfolio that has accumulated a number of investments isn't always eacy tomonitor.andP;  And if you haven't found an easy way to scrutinize your portfolioregularly, your investments may not conform to your strategy.andP;  worse, youcould be missing more-lucrative investment opportunities.andM;It isn't hard to construct a 1-2-3 or Symphony worksheet to tract individualinvestments and summarize your portfolio by investment type.andP;  You can usesuch a template to measure growth over the life of your investments or forany specific period.andP;  In addition, you can uncover the unrealized tax gainsand losses lurking in your portfolio.andM;To sort and track the funds in your individual retirement accounts, pensionplans, mutual funds, money market funds, stockbrokerage accounts,certificates of deposit, and other investments, construct the modely by usingthe instructions in the box on pages 62 and 63.andM;The Portfolio SummaryandM;The summary shown in figure 1 provides a snapshot of the portfolio.andP;  Formulasin column B add up the assets in each category, and formulas in column Ccalculate each category as a percentage of the total.andP;  In this example, 19%of the portfolio's total assets are in cash investments, 34% in stockinvestments, and so on.andP;  This summary divides the portfolio into five classesof assets: cash, stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments.andM;In figure 1, only cells B5 and E5 require user input.andP;  The input in cell B5,June 15, 1990, tells the model to measure your investment' progress from thetime they were acquired through June 15 of this year.andM;The date you enter in cell E5 is an intermediate point for checkinginvestment growth for all investments from a specific point in time to theending date.andP;  In the example, cell E5 is January 1, 1990.andP;  This input helpsframe the question, &quot;What progress have my investment groups and individualinvestments made between the beginning of the year and June 15?&quot;andM;Columns D and E of the porfolio summary use these dates along with the @RATEfunction to calculate the rates of return for each of your investmentcategories.andP;  Column D calculates an overall rate of return, while column Ecalculates the rate of return between the two dates you entered-in this case,between January 1 and June 15.andP;  In the example, the stocks in the portfoliohave appreciated at an annual average rate of 50% since they were acquire.andO;Between January 1 and June 15, they appreciated at an annual average rate of18.76%.andM;The Investment RegisterandM;The summary information comes from data entered in the investment register infigure 2.andP;  Press the HOME key and then the Tab key (in Sumphony, hold downthe Control key and press the Right Arrow key) to see the investment registeron your screen.andM;If you used the instruction in the setup box, the investment register willcontain the entries shown in figure 2.andP;  The labels and values you entered incolumns G through M pertain to individual assets.andM;Column G contains the name or a bried description of the asset.andP;  In column H,a one-letter code identifies the asset, based on the categories shown infigure 3.andP;  For example, each of the three stock investments in rows 10through 12 is marked with an S, while the bond investment in row 9 is markedwith a B.andP;  The model's criterion ranges include lowercase letters, so you canalso use lowercase letters to identify these investment types.andM;In column I, you mark an investment as taxable or nontaxable.andP;  For the mostpart, investment gains are taxed when you sell the asset.andP;  The exceptions tothis rule usually relate to tax-deterred accounts, such as employer pensionand profit sharing plans and Individual Retirement Accounts.andP;  For moreinformation on this point, refer to a tax-preparation guide.andM;The information in columns J, K, and L comes straight from your financialrecords.andP;  Enter the original gross cost of the investment in column J.andP;  Inmost cases, this includes commissions or fees incurred to acquire the asset.andO;Use the @DATE function to record the date of the acquisition in column K.andM;To get an accurate measure of an asset's rate of return, you must take intoaccount both the asset's appreciation and the income generated while you haveowned it.andP;  Enter the total before-tax income over the life of the asset incolumn L.andP;  For most assets, this will simply be the dividends or interestreceived.andM;The current value of the asset-in this case, the value on June 15, 1990-goesin column M.andP;  for an accurate calculation of the rate of return and taxliabilities, you should estimate a sales commission.andP;  Then in column M, enterthe current asset value minus the estimated commision.andP;  For example, the AcmeCorp. shares i n this portfolio have a market value of $4,600.andP;  But since thecommission for selling the shares would be about $100, their real value inthe portfolio is only $4,500.andP;  This is also the amount used to figure taxgain or loss.andP;  Therefore, cell M10 contains $4,500 instead of $4,600.andM;Rate of Return and Tax LiabilityandM;In column N, the investment register calculates the rate of return forindividual assets, from the time you acquired them through the date youentered in cell B5.andM;In this portfolio, Howieco International stock is the star performer.andP;  CellK12 shows that the stock was acquired on June 15, 1989.andP;  The cost was $5,000,which is shown in cell J12.andP;  Its value as of June 15, 1990, the date youentered in cell B5, is $10,000, which appears in cell M12.andP;  The stock hasdoubled its value in exactly a year-the 100% gain reported in cell N12.andM;The mathematical constraints of the @RATE function make the formulas incolumn N somewhat long and complex.andP;  Column N takes into account both assetappreciation and income in determining return on investment.andP;  However, if theformula counted income as a lump sum, it would skew the results forincome-producing investments, especially for those that have been in theportfolio for a long time.andM;To correct for this deficiency while retaining the flexibility of the @RATEfunction, the formulas in column N (and columns D, E, and R, As well) splitthe total income into equal yearly payments and then use the @FV function tocompound these payments.andP;  The @FV function uses the reinvestment rate in cellJ3 to make this calculation.andM;In this example, the reinvestment rate is 10%.andP;  So if an asset had been inthe portfolio for three years and showed a total income of $300 in column L,the formula in column N would assume that the income had been earned at arate of $100 per year and would have compounded the $100 amounts by 10% ayear.andM;This method isn't a precise way to measure rate of return because paymentsand compounding don't necessarily occur on an annual basis.andP;  But the resultis fairly close to the true rate of return.andP;  This isn't necessarily true,however, for assets whose income occurs in widely varying amounts or atirregular intervals.andP;  The formula is precise for asets that aren't earningincome.andM;Press the Tab key again to view the remaining four columns of the investmentregister.andP;  Column O shows the taxable gains or losses associated whith eachasset.andP;  If you enter Y or y in column I to identify an asset as subject tocapital gains, column O subtracts the original cost from the current value tofind the tax gain or loss you'll have if you sell the assetandM;For example, the Realty Trust shares in row 7 were purchased for $20,000,including commission.andP;  If they were sold on the current date, the portfolio'sowner would net $24,000 after commissions.andP;  The $4,000 difference is thepotential taxable income.andP;  On the other hand, gains or losses on the bondfund shown in row 9 will not show up in column O because you entered N incell 19.andM;Reviewing the unrealized tax gains and losses in your portfolio may help youdiscover tax-saving opportunities.andP;  There's much talk of changing the weaycapital gains are taxed, but as of this writing the rules are fairly simple.andO;For all the assets sold during any given tax year, subtract the losses fromthe gains.andP;  If the net result is positive, you pay taxes on the gain at yourmarginal tax rate.andP;  If the net result is negative, you can use up to $3,000(or $1,500 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) of the loss as adeduction in the current year.andP;  Any excess above this amount can be carriedover and used in future years.andM;The inputs in colums P and Q correspond to the date you entered in cell E5.andO;To calculate the annual rate of return for an asset between January 1, 1990,and the current date (June 15), you must know the value of the asset onJanuary 1 (column P) and the amount of income it has generated since then(column Q).andP;  The annualized rates of return for individual assets for theperiod January 1 through June 15 are calculated by the formulas in column R.andM;How the Model WorksandM;The model relies heavily on two @functions: @DSUM and @RATE.andP;  The portfoliosummary uses @DSUM formulas to categorize your investments into the groupsyou have defined.andM;The @DSUM function uses the syntax: @DSUM(database, offset, criterion).andP;  The@DSUM formulas in column B use the range named db, which contains informationabout individual assets, as its database argument.andP;  Each formula in column Buses an offset value of 6 and one of the criterion ranges shown in figure 3.andM;For example, the formula in cell B8 reads @DSUM($db,6,stock).andP;  This formulalocates all entries in db that are marked as type S or s-either of which is acriterion for stock-and then adds the values that are six columns to theright of column G, the first column in db.andP;  Since the entries in rows 10,11,and 12 meet this criterion, the formula in cell B8 adds together 4,500,7,500, and 10,000 for a total current stock value of $22,000.andM;@RATE calculates an annual rate of return using the following syntax:@RATE(future_value, present_value, period).andP;  The @RATE formula in cell N11 ofthe investment register is a simple example.andP;  Future value is actually thecurrent value less commissions, or $7,500.andP;  Added to that is the future valueof a total incoem of $0.andP;  which is $0.andP;  Present value is actually theoriginal cost, $5,000.andP;  Period is calculated by substracting the purchasedate from the current date and dividing the difference by 365.andP;  This assetwas purchased exactly one year earlier.andP;  So the formula calculates theone-year rate of return on an asset that grew in value from $5,000 to $7,500:50.00%andM;The @RATE formulas in column D of the porfolio summary are more complex.andO;They use @DSUM formulas to determine the total current value, original cost,and number of days that any investment type, say stocks, has been in theportfolio.andP;  For example, each of the three stock investment in the portfoliowas acquired for $5,000 one year earlier.andP;  The respective returns are 0.00%,50.00%, and 100.00%.andP;  Because the stocks originally cost the same amount, theformula weights them equally and computes a 50.00% average return in cell D8.andM;If one of the stock investments had been bought on a different date or at adifferent price, this would change the computation of the weighted average incell D8.andP;  For example, what if the high-risk stock fund had been acquired onJune 15, 1987, instead of June 15, 1989?andP;  You would still have the sameamount of money in your portfolio, but a slower-moving asset in the stockgroup would lower the overall stock return in cell D8 to about 27.58%.andM;The @RATE formula in column E work similarly to those in column D, exceptthat they cover performance over a specific period of time.andP;  So while cell D9shows that the bonds in the example have had a low rate of return over thelong haul, their performance between January 1 and June 15, shown in cell E9,has been above the portfolio's average rate of return during this period.andM;Adjusting the ModelandM;It's easy to modify the investment register for your own portfolio.andP;  First,enter the current date in cell B5.andP;  If you're doing the calculation for aspecific date, use the @DATE formula to enter the date, or edit the existing@DATE formula.andP;  If the calculation involves today's values, enter the formula@INT(@NOW).andM;Enter a reinvestment rate in cell J3.andP;  This rate is an estimate, but a goodbenchmark might be the going rate on one-year Treasury bills.andM;Erase all entries in ranges G7..M13 and P7..Q13.andP;  Then enter information forthe assets.andP;  If you don't need all seven blank rows, start entering assets inrow 13 and work your way up.andP;  Then move the labels at the top of the database(range G1..R6) to the row just above your first entry.andP;  If you need morerows, place the cell pointer in row 13, select /Worksheet Insert Row (inSymphony, MENU Insert Rows) and indicate the extra rows needed.andP;  Make surethat no blank rows are left in the investment register after you've enteredall the assets.andM;Enter a category code for each investment recorded in the register.andP;  Thesecodes must correspond to the categories that appear in the criterion rangesshown in figure 3.andP;  You can add, delete, or change categories.andM;For example, if you trade precious metals but never buy bonds, change thelabel in cells A9 and C21 to reflect metals rather than bonds.andP;  Alter thelabels in cells C23 and C24 to M and m.andP;  As soon as you add one of theseinvestments to the investment register and mark it with an M or m, it willshow up in the portfolio summary.andP;  The formulas there will no longer evaluateto 0 or ERR.andP;  The model retains the range name bond, which now serves as thecriterion range for metls.andP;  Keep in mind that there must be a blank criterionrecord in the all category.andM;Adding categories takes more work.andP;  To add a categor for options, forexample, enter the following labels:andM;Cell  Label G21  Options G22  Type G23  P G24  pandM;Notice that you can't use O or o as the category code, because O is alreadythe code for Other investments-those that don't fit neatly into any categorythat has already been defined.andP;  Use the Range Name Create command to assignthe range name opt to range G22..G24.andM;Adjust your portfolio summary to reflect the new category.andP;  To do this, moverange A11.E14 to cell A12.andP;  Range All..E11 should now be blank.andP;  Add thefollowing labels and formulas:andM;Cell  Entry A11  Options Trading B11  @DSUM($db,6,opt) C11  +B11/B14 D11 @RATE(B11+@FV@DSUM ($db,5,opt)/((B$5- @DAVG($db,4,opt))/365), $J$3,(B$5-@DAVG($db,4,opt))/365), @DSUM($db,3,opt), (B$5-@DAVG($db, 4,opt))/365) E11 @IF(@DCOUNT($db,1, optandgt;andless;@DCOUNT($db, 10,opt),@NA,@RATE (B11+@FV(@DSUM($db,10,opt)/((B$5-E$5)/ 365),$J$3,(B$5-E$5)/ 365),@DSUM($db,9,opt),(($B$5-$E$5)/365)))andM;Finally, use the Range Format (in Symphony, MENU Format) command to make theformats for these cells correspond to the formats used in the columns infigure 1.andP;  When you enter an options record, these formulas will no longerevaluate to 0 or ERR.andM;A Few TipsandM;The interim-return part of the model column E in the portfolio summary andcolumns P, Q, and R in the investment register-is optional.andP;  If you don'twant to measure a portfolio's growth over a set period of time or don't havethe necessary information, leave columns P and Q blank.andP;  The formulas incolumns E and R will return NA for any asset or group of assets that ismissing entries in columns P and Q.andM;One you've entered an asset, leave it in the register unit it is sold.andP;  If aportion of an asset is sold, though, adjust the register entry.andP;  If half theinterest in the high-risk stock fund in the example were sold, you wouldchange the original cost (cell J11) from $5,000 to $2,500.andM;As shown in the entry for the money market fund in the example, there is nocapital appreciation on short-term cash assets.andP;  The interest collected iscounted as current income and taxed accordingly.andM;Finally, keep in mind that more-complex investments, usch as real estate,require a separate analysis.andP;  This template provides fairly sophisticatedformulas for sorting through paper investments, but assets that depreciate orare subject to complex tax rules require a customized template.andM;Stephen L.
