Community leaders say the suppression of the May-June democracymovement in Beijing has increased fears of what might be in storefor Macao, a reaction also experienced in the nearby British colonyof Hong Kong, which reverts to China in 1997.   ``We are exactly in the same situation as is Hong Kong,'' saidLegislative Assembly member Alexandre Ho. ``The confidence crisishas worsened,''   Portugal agreed in 1987 to return this six square-mile enclave ofabout half a million people, almost 97 percent of whom are ethnicChinese, to China in 1999. Beijing promised Macao _ as it did withHong Kong _ that it could maintain its capitalist system for 50years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy.   Macao residents joined their Hong Kong brethren inenthusiastically supporting the student-led democracy movement inChina.   On June 4, when reports on the Chinese military suppression ofthe movement in Beijing began to reach Macao, an estimatedone-fourth of the territory's population streamed into the narrowstreets to denounce China's leaders.   In both colonies, the crackdown led to plunging property marketsand increased interest in emigration.   ``We know many of our friends are preparing to leave,'' saidlegislator Ho. Press reports in Lisbon say wealthy Macao residentsare depositing more personal wealth in Portugal.   But the trauma in Macao appears not as great as it is in HongKong, in part because many people in Macao can find new homes before1999 with their Portuguese passports.   Although the more than 3 million Hong Kong residents are eligiblefor British passports, they have no right to settle in Britain. Theyhave bitterly denounced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sgovernment in London for refusing to change that policy after theChinese crackdown.   But the 100,000 or so Macao residents with Portuguese passportsnot only have full rights to live in Portugal but expect to be ableto settle almost anywhere in Western Europe, including Britain,after the European Economic Community removes trade and otherbarriers by the end of 1992.   Ho believes that perhaps a quarter of Portuguese passport holdersin Macao will leave. Many of those who stay will do so because theyhave ``no language skills, no work skills and no capital to start anew life,'' he said.   The assemblyman says he has yet to decide whether he will use hisPortuguese passport to emigrate but acknowledges the crackdown inChina ``makes me less comfortable.''   Another man yet to make a final decision is Stanley Ho, who hasmade a fortune leading the monopoly that runs Macao's six gamblingcasinos.   He said he plans to watch carefully what happens to Hong Kongafter China takes over in 1997.   ``If it doesn't work ... you may see me in San Francisco orCanada or Europe,'' he said. ``If it's going to be difficult,inconvenient, I'll have to say, `Cheerio'.''   Such a breezy response is not possible for the 400,000 Macaoresidents without Portuguese passports, many of whom are recentimmigrants from China and do not have the money, education or familyconnections to obtain residency rights in other countries.   Their chances to emigrate appear dim and the Portuguesegovernment is not considering helping them leave.   Settled in 1557 as the first European foothold in Asia, Macaoonce was a major colonial trading center but long ago was surpassedby Hong Kong, just 40 miles to the northeast.   Politically, Beijing's influence in Macao has grown in recentdecades; in 1967 the territory agreed to deport to Chinaanti-communist troublemakers. Most local business and civic leaderssupport the Chinese government while the media, except for a fewweeks during the democracy movement, generally toe the officialBeijing line.   Economically, the casinos and light industry remain the mainstay.   ``I've served more than 10 governors,'' said Stanley Ho, who hasthe gambling monopoly through 2001. ``Each and every one of themtried to rely less on gambling. I think none of them have succeeded.The gambling revenue in Macao is very important.''   He added that he has received personal assurances from China thatgambling will be allowed after 1999.   In an effort to help the territory's fortunes, Ho has joinedforces with the Macao government and China to build an offshoreinternational airport. The $450-million first phase is scheduled forcompletion in 1993. Other major construction projects include adeep-water harbor.   While some people say the airport will not attract enoughbusiness to be viable, others say it is essential to attract foreigninvestment and bring more tourists to the territory.   But Bishop Domingos Lam, who heads the 27,000-member RomanCatholic Church in Macao, sees no end to what he describes as thehistorical tendency of local residents to move elsewhere in searchof a brigher future. The recent events in China, he said, have onlyquickened the process.   ``Those who have qualifications go out; those who don't havequalifications stay,'' he said.   ``The old generation of Macao has already moved out. Take myfamily, for instance. I'm left alone to look after the graves.   ``I'm the only Lam left in Macao.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs Sept. 21</NOTE></DOC>
