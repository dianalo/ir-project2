Walter Yetnikoff, who has been president of CBS Records, also is a member of the board.    CBS said yesterday it completed the sale of the record operations for about $2 billion. The sale gives Sony control of the world's largest record company, with 10,000 employees world-wide.    After a definitive sale agreement was announced last November, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., the credit rating concern, said the deal would give CBS a &quot;high level of liquidity for several years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
