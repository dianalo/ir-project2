In southern Egypt, rescue teams pulled 10 bodies out of the NileRiver after a cruiser capsized and sunk during a storm a dayearlier, the Middle East News Agency reported. They were identifiedas six Italian tourists and four Egyptians.   Ten Italian nationals and 13 Egyptians were missing, thestate-owned news agency said.   Electric power was restored to parts of the Sudanese capital ofKhartoum, but the country still faced the dangers of an overflowingNile River and the possible outbreak of diseases.   In its early Friday edition, the state-run al-Ahram daily said33 airplanes carrying food, medicine and relief supplies hadarrived in Khartoum, including 20 from Egypt, seven from SaudiArabia and others from Italy, Britain and Jordan.   In Rome, the World Food Program announced Thursday it wassupplying more than 6,000 tons of emergency food aid to floodvictims.   ``The quantities, together with bilateral aid provided fromlocally available stocks, will be sufficient to feed ... about 1million people'' for one month, the agency said in a statement.   The United States has arranged to airlift more than 850 rolls ofplastic sheets to serve as tents for some of the homeless. It isalso sending 1,200 tons of grain and food and $1 million worth ofother relief supplies.   The Geneva-based International Red Cross said it was sending2,000 tons of food. Red Cross offices in Britain, the Netherlandsand Denmark are flying in 1,000 tents, nearly 50,000 blankets and 1million water purification tablets.   National Red Cross societies and governments also have pledged$615,000 to purchase flour, cooking oil and other supplies.   The World Food Program said relief workers fear outbreaks ofcholera, dysentery and malaria.   Sudanese officials blamed the recent floods on inadequatedrainage systems. Last week's rainfall in Khartoum and itssurrounding areas was 8.4 inches, compared with only 1.44 inchesduring all of 1987.   Khartoum and three other cities in eastern and northern Sudanhave been declared disaster areas, and Prime Minister Sadekel-Mahdi has announced a nationwide state of emergency for sixmonths.   The Blue Nile, which converges at Khartoum with the White Nileto form the Nile River, was rising rapidly behind the Sennar andRosseire dams.   The possibility of the Nile overflowing its banks will bedetermined during the last 10 days of August, Sudan's IrrigationMinister Mahmoud Beshir said Thursday.   MENA said Thursday that the Blue Nile had covered 150 houses onthe island of Tuti facing Khartoum, and the government wasinstructing inhabitants to place sand bags along the river bank tostop the rising waters.   The Nile has surged beyond levels recorded in 1946, when it hadits worst flood on record, Khartoum's governor, Gen. El-FatehAbdoon, was quoted by MENA as saying.
