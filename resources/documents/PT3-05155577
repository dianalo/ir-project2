The engineering change      network includes a multitude of connecting pads, and a multitude of first,      second, and third conductive leads or wires, and each of the connecting      pads includes first and second spaced apart sections. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention generally relates to integrated circuit device carriers,      commonly known as packages, on which devices can be bonded for electrical      contact and mechanical support. More particularly, the invention relates      to the technique of and structure for making engineering changes in such      carriers to alter the original circuit designs of the carriers or to      correct wiring defects. </PAR><PAR>  In modern integrated circuit packaging technology, many integrated circuit      devices may be mounted on a substrate containing a printed circuit network      that interconnects the devices with each other and to input and output      terminals on the substrate. Such substrates, normally made of ceramic      material, are very complex, containing 30 or more layers of ceramic      sheets. Typically, the internal printed circuit network of the substrate      is comprised of a multitude of lines or traces on a given layer, and a      multitude of connectors or small connecting assemblies, between the      layers. These connectors or connecting assemblies are referred to as vias. </PAR><PAR>  The lines or traces of the network extend internally of the substrate, in      one or more planes parallel to a top surface of the substrate; and the      vias are electrically connected to these internal lines or traces and      extend upward therefrom to the top surface of the substrate, thereby      providing access to the internal circuit network. Even more specifically,      the internal lines or traces of the network are comprised of the first set      of parallel conductive lines that extend in a first direction, referred to      as the X direction, and a second set of parallel conductive lines that      extend in a second direction perpendicular to the above-mentioned first      direction, and referred to as the y direction. </PAR><PAR>  After the substrate has been laminated and sintered, there is no practical      way of changing the buried internal network. However, it often becomes      necessary to modify the circuit design of the substrate, either to correct      defective lines or vias, or to make changes to the basic circuitry. Such      basic changes may be appropriate to accommodate changes in the integrated      circuit devices carried on the substrate, to upgrade the substrate or to      modify it for use with different circuit devices. </PAR><PAR>  The changes needed to modify the internal circuit network of a substrate or      carrier are referred to as engineering changes; and the contingency that      such changes may be needed is typically provided for by the use of      engineering change pads, which are small, electrically conductive      locations on the top surface of the substrate of the carrier. Engineering      change pads surround each integrated circuit device mounted on the      substrate, and a respective one engineering change pad is associated with      each signal (logic) terminal of each circuit device carried on the      substrate. Fan out metallurgy is normally provided on the top surface or      on the top layers of the substrate to connect each integrated circuit      device terminal with the associated engineering change pad, and each      engineering change pad is also connected to buried circuitry in the      substrate, to thereby connect the associated circuit device terminal with      other circuit devices and/or input/output terminal on the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  To bypass a defective line or trace buried in the substrate, or to      otherwise modify the internal circuitry of the substrate, an engineering      change pad is cut or severed to electrically disconnect that engineering      change pad, and the associated circuit device terminal, from the internal      circuitry inside the substrate. One end of a wire is then joined to the      portion of the engineering change pad still electrically connected to the      associated circuit device terminal. The other end of the wire is then      joined to a second engineering change pad that had been similarly cut or      severed, thereby electrically connecting the first circuit device terminal      to a second terminal or to the internal circuitry connected to the second      engineering change pad. The same basic technique can be used to substitute      for defective electric lines in a substrate and to change the internal      electric network of the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  While the engineering change technique described above works well, there      are some disadvantages. For example, in order to accommodate the necessary      wire bonding, the engineering change pads are relatively large, compared      to the terminals of the integrated circuit devices carried by the      substrate, and thus the engineering change pads occupy a great deal of      space on the top surface of the substrate. As integrated circuit devices      become smaller, more such devices can be mounted on a given area on a      substrate surface. When this is done, there is a corresponding increase in      the number of device logic terminals in a given area on the substrate. The      additional device terminals require additional engineering change pads;      and with the size of the engineering change pads constrained to      accommodate wire bonding, the total area required by the engineering      change pads increases dramatically. Indeed, for an integrated circuit      device carrier having a high density of device logic terminals, there      simply is not enough room on the carrier to provide one engineering change      pad for each circuit device terminal. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of this invention is to provide a new and improved method and      structure for modifying an inaccessible circuit network in a modular      substrate that supports and interconnects a multitude of integrated      circuit devices. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide an engineering change      technique for making circuit changes in a carrier for a multitude of      integrated circuit devices, where the number of engineering change pads is      less than the number of device logic terminals on the carrier. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the present invention is to provide a unique pathway      between each of a multitude of device logic terminals on a carrier for      integrated circuit devices and each of a multitude of engineering change      pads on the carrier, thereby allowing each of an arbitrary subset of the      terminals to be connected to a respective one of the engineering change      pads even though the number of engineering change pads is less than the      number of device terminals. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide a carrier for integrated      circuit devices in which, in comparison to conventional circuit carriers,      more joints and less deletes are performed to effect an engineering      change. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objectives are obtained with an integrated circuit carrier      comprising a modular substrate having an upper surface, a multitude of      electrically conducting device terminals on the upper surface of the      substrate, a multitude of electrically conducting engineering change pads      also on the upper surface of the substrate, and an engineering change      network to form a unique electrical connection between each of an      arbitrary subset of the device terminals and each of an arbitrary subset      of the engineering change pads. Preferably, the engineering change network      includes a multitude of connecting pads, and a multitude of first, second,      and third conductive leads or wires, and each of the connecting pads      includes first and second spaced apart sections. </PAR><PAR>  Each device terminal is connected to the first section of a respective one      connecting pad by one of the first leads; and the second section of each      connecting pad is connected to one of the engineering change pads by a      respective one of the second leads, and to another of the engineering      change pads by a respective one of the third leads. Each engineering      change pad includes a main bonding area and a multitude of inlet      terminals; and each inlet terminal of each engineering change pad is      connected to one of the connecting pads by a respective one of the second      leads, and to another of the connecting pads by a respective one of the      third leads. This engineering change network can be used to form a      multitude of pathways to connect each of a multitude of adjacent device      terminals to a respective one engineering change pad despite the fact that      there are fewer engineering change pads than device terminals. </PAR><PAR>  Further benefits and advantages of the invention will become apparent from      a consideration of the following detailed description given with reference      to the accompanying drawings, which specify and show preferred embodiments      of the invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a partial, top plan view of a modular carrier for integrated      circuit devices, in accordance with the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an enlarged view of the portion of FIG. 1 designated at A, and      showing a multitude of engineering change pads, a multitude of device      terminals, and a network interconnecting the engineering change pads and      the device terminals. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a schematic view in perspective that illustrates buried      engineering change lines in the carrier of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a still further enlarged view of a portion of FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5-8 illustrate how various conductive pathways may be formed to      connect each of four adjacent device terminals to a respective one      engineering change pad. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a portion of module substrate 10, having mounted thereon a      plurality of integrated circuit devices 12, about each of which is an      engineering change network schematically represented at 14. The      engineering change networks 14 are substantially identical, and a portion      of one network is shown in FIG. 2. With reference to this Figure, each      network 14 includes a multitude of engineering change pads 16, a multitude      of linking or connecting pads 20, a multitude of first leads 22 and a      wiring sub-network 24, which in turn includes a multitude of second leads      26 and a multitude of third leads 30. Five engineering change pads are      shown in FIG. 2 and referenced therein at 16-1, 16-2, 16-3, 16-4, and      16-5. Twenty connecting pads are shown in FIG. 2 and six of these are      referenced at 20-1 through 20-6. FIG. 2 also shows twenty first leads,      twenty second leads, and twenty third leads. Four of the first leads are      referenced at 22-1 through 22-4, six of the second leads are referenced at      26-1 through 26-6, and four of the third leads are referenced at 30-1      through 30-4. FIG. 2 also schematically shows a multitude of device      contact pads or terminals 32 of one of the integrated circuit devices 12,      and four of these device terminals are specifically referenced at 32-1      through 32-4. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, each engineering change network extends completely      around a respective one circuit device 12. Also, the engineering change      pads 16 of each network 14 are arranged in four linear arrays, one along      each of the four sides of the associated circuit device 12. These features      are not necessary to the practice of this invention though; and, for      example, a network 14 may extend along only two or three sides of a      circuit device 12. In addition, preferably a multitude of dogbone pads,      one of which is shown at 34 in FIG. 1, extend around each circuit device      12 and each network 14. </PAR><PAR>  With particular regard to FIG. 3, also included in substrate 10 is an      internal network 36 comprised of a multitude of buried engineering change      lines in the x-direction, a multitude of buried engineering change lines      in the y-direction, and a multitude of vias, which extend from these      buried engineering change lines to the top surface of the substrate and      which are connected to dogbone pads 34. Network 36 completes the      interconnections between the device terminals of an integrated circuit      device to the connecting pads, which were wire bonded to the dogbone pads,      to other dogbone pads of a second integrated circuit device. </PAR><PAR>  Substrate 10 is typically a multilayer ceramic substrate and may be, for      example, of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,245,273. Substrate 10 is      comprised of a plurality of laminated ceramic sheets that have been      punched to form holes for the vias, and in which conductive metal line      patterns have been made to form the buried engineering change lines. The      laminated sheet assembly is subsequently sintered to form a unitary      substrate. Many suitable procedures are well known for forming a carrier,      and the internal circuit network thereof, for integrated circuit devices,      and any such procedure may be employed to manufacture substrate 10 and      internal circuit network 36. </PAR><PAR>  The engineering change pads on substrate 10 are substantially identical and      thus only one such pad, shown in FIG. 4, will be described herein in      detail. Each engineering change pad includes a main bonding area or      section, a plurality of input terminals, and a respective one lead      connecting each input terminal of the pad to the main bonding area      thereof. With the particular embodiment of the engineering pad shown in      FIG. 4, each pad includes four input terminals, and hence, four connecting      leads. In FIG. 4, the main bonding area of the engineering pad is      identified by the same number as the pad, but with the added suffix &quot;a,&quot;      and the input terminals of the engineering pad are also identified by the      same number as the pad, but with the added suffixes &quot;b,&quot; &quot;c,&quot; &quot;d,&quot; and      &quot;e.&quot; Similarly, the connecting leads of the engineering pad shown in FIG.      4 are identified by the same number as the engineering pad, but with the      added suffixes &quot;f,&quot; &quot;g,&quot; &quot;h,&quot; and &quot;i.&quot; Thus, for instance, lead 16-3f      connects terminal 16-3b to bonding area 16-3a, and lead 16-3h connects      terminal 16-3d to bonding area 16-3a. </PAR><PAR>  Each linking pad 20 includes first, second, and third sections and a      respective one lead connecting the third section of the pad to the second      section thereof. In FIG. 4, the first, second, and third sections of each      linking pad are identified by the same number as the linking pad, but with      added suffixes &quot;a,&quot; &quot;b,&quot; and &quot;c&quot; respectively; and the connecting lead of      each linking pad is identified by the same number as the linking pad, but      with the added suffix &quot;d.&quot; Thus, for example, lead 20-4d connects sections      20-4c and 20-4b of linking pad 20-4, and lead 20-1d connects sections      20-1c and 20-1b of linking pad 20-1. The first section of each linking pad      is spaced from and is normally electrically disconnected from the second      section of the linking pad; and the second and third sections of each      linking pad are also spaced apart, but these two pads are normally      electrically connected by the connecting lead of the linking pad. </PAR><PAR>  With the preferred arrangement shown in FIG. 2, the linking pads of      engineering change network 14 are positioned between the engineering      change pads 16 and the device terminals 32. Moreover, the first section of      each linking pad 20 is on the side of the pad toward the engineering      change pads, the third section of the linking pad is on the side thereof      toward the device terminals, and the second section of the linking pad is      between the first and third sections thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Each device terminal 32 is connected to a respective one linking pad 20,      specifically the second section thereof, by one of the first leads 22 of      network 14. For example, with reference to FIG. 2, device terminal 32-4 is      connected to linking pad 20-4 by lead 22-4, and device terminal 32-2 is      connected to linking pad 20-2 by lead 22-2. In addition, each linking pad,      specifically the first section thereof, is connected to inlet terminals of      two adjacent engineering change pads by a respective one of the second      leads 26 and a respective one of the third leads 30; and each engineering      change pad inlet terminal is connected to two linking pads 20,      specifically the first sections thereof, by a respective one of the second      leads and a respective one of the third leads. For instance, the first      section of linking pad 20-4 is connected to one inlet terminal of pad 16-3      by lead 26-4 and to one inlet terminal of pad 16-2 by lead 30-4, and the      first section of linking pad 20-1 is connected to one inlet terminal of      engineering change pad 16-4 by lead 26-1, and to one inlet terminal of pad      16-3 by lead 30-1. Also, one inlet terminal of pad 16-3 is connected to      linking pad 20-1 by lead 30-1 and to linking pad 20-5 by lead 26-5, and an      inlet terminal of pad 16-2 is connected to linking pad 20-3 by lead 30-3      and to linking pad 20-6 by lead 26-6. </PAR><PAR>  With the above-described arrangement, each linking pad is directly or      indirectly connected to all of the engineering change pads of each network      14, and a unique electrically conductive path may be formed between each      linking pad and each of the engineering change pads of the network.      Further, each engineering change pad is directly connected to the number      of linking pads equal to twice the number of inlet terminals of the      engineering change pad. </PAR><PAR>  Leads 22, 26, and 30 may be formed as a separate surface metallurgy layer      with an isolating dielectric layer, these leads may be formed in the top      surface layers of substrate 10, or as a combination thereof. It should be      noted, though, that leads 26 are electrically insulated or separated from      leads 30 as these two sets of leads cross over or under each other in the      area between the engineering pads 16 and the connecting pads 20. Moreover,      the device terminals 32 are preferably solder wettable and the engineering      change pads 16 are wire bondable. The device terminals are joined to      terminals of the integrated circuit devices 12 by any suitable solder      connection, for instance, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,429,040. </PAR><PAR>  As previously mentioned, engineering change pads are provided to allow the      circuitry of a modular substrate to be changed after that substrate has      been made. Typically, heretofore, each device terminal was connected to a      respective one engineering change pad, so that electrical access was      available to each and every device terminal connection. The arrangement of      the present invention provides the same results for all practical purposes      even though the number of engineering change pads is less, and preferably      substantially less, than the number of device terminals. This result is      achieved by the multiplicity of possible electrically conductive pathways      between each engineering change pad 16 and the device terminals 32. More      specifically, connecting pads 20, leads 26 and 30, and the inlet terminals      of the engineering change pads can be used to form a multitude of circuits      to connect each of a multitude of adjacent device terminals to the main      bonding area of a respective one engineering change pad despite the fact      that there are fewer engineering change pads than device terminals. </PAR><PAR>  To better illustrate the operation and advantages of the present invention,      a specific example will be described in which four adjacent device      terminals 32-1 through 32-4 are each connected to a respective one      engineering change pad. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIGS. 2 and 5, device terminal 32-1 can be electrically      connected to engineering change pad 16-3 by bridging the gap between the      first and second sections of connecting pad 20-1 as shown at 50 in FIG. 5,      thereby forming an electrically conducting pathway from terminal 32-1 to      the bonding area 16-3a of change pad 16-3, comprising lead 22-1, the first      and second sections of connecting pad 20-1, lead 30-1 and terminal 16-3c      and lead 16-3g of change pad 16-3. Typically, it would be preferred to      break or to sever the other leads 16-3f, 16-3h, and 16-3i of change pad      16-3, as shown at 52 in FIG. 5, and to break or sever leads 26-1 and 26-5,      as shown at 54 in FIG. 5, to ensure that device terminal 32-1 is the only      device terminal electrically connected to the bonding area of engineering      change pad 16-3. It would also be preferred to break or sever lead 20-1d,      as shown at 56 in FIG. 5, to separate device terminal 32-1 from the via      connected to connecting pad section 20-1c of the internal network      previously connected to the device terminal 32-1. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIGS. 2 and 6, device terminal 32-2 can be electrically      connected to engineering change pad 16-4 by bridging the gap between the      first and second sections of connecting pad 20-2, as shown at 58 in FIG.      6, thereby forming an electrically conductive pathway from terminal 32-2      to bonding area 16-4a of change pad 16-4, comprising lead 22-2, the first      and second sections of connecting pad 20-2, lead 26-1 and terminal 16-4b      and lead 16-4f of change pad 16-4. Normally, it would be preferred to      break the other leads 16-4g, 16-4h, and 16-4i of change pad 16-4, as shown      at 60, and to break or sever leads 30-2 and 30-5 as shown at 62 in FIG. 6,      to ensure that device terminal 32-2 is the only device terminal      electrically connected to the main bonding area of engineering change pad      16-4. It would also be preferred to break lead 20-2d, as shown at 64 in      FIG. 6, to separate terminal 32-2 from the via connected to connecting pad      section 20-2c of the previously connected internal network. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, with reference to FIGS. 2 and 7, device terminal 32-3 can be      electrically connected to the bonding area of engineering change pad 16-2      by bridging the gap between the first and second sections of connecting      pad 20-3, as shown at 66 in FIG. 7, thus forming an electrically      conductive pathway between terminal 32-3 and the bonding area of      engineering change pad 16-2, including lead 22-3, the first and second      sections of connecting pad 20-3, lead 30-3, and terminal 16-2e and lead      16-2i of change pad 16-2. Preferably, leads 16-2f, 16-2g, and 16-2h of      change pad 16-2 and leads 26-3 and 26-7 are all broken to ensure that      device terminal 32-3 is the only device terminal electrically connected to      the main bonding area of engineering change pad 16-2. Further, preferably      lead 20-3d is broken, as shown at 68 in FIG. 7, to separate device      terminal 32-3 from the via connected to connecting pad section 20-3c of      the previously connected internal network. </PAR><PAR>  With reference to FIGS. 2 and 8, device terminal 32-4 is connected to      engineering change pad 16-1 by bridging the gap between the first and      second sections of connecting pad 20-4. Lead 16-2h of engineering change      pad 16-2 has already been broken. This forms a circuit from device      terminal 32-4 to the main bonding area of engineering change pad 16-1      comprised of lead 22-4, the first and second sections of connecting pad      20-4, lead 30-4, inlet terminal 16-2d of engineering change pad 16-2, lead      26-6, connecting pad section 20-5a, lead 30-5, and terminal 16-1d and lead      16-1h of engineering change pad 16-1. Preferably, leads 16-1f, 16-1g, and      16-1i are all broken, as shown at 74, and leads 26-4 and 26-8 are broken,      as shown at 76 in FIG. 8, to ensure that device terminal 32-4 is the only      device terminal electrically connected to the main bonding area of      engineering change pad 16-1. Lead 20-4d is also broken, as shown at 78 in      FIG. 8, to disconnect device terminal 32-4 from the via connected to      connecting pad section 20-4c. </PAR><PAR>  Any suitable procedures may be used to connect the first and second      sections of the connecting pads 20, as shown at 50 in FIG. 5. For example,      these sections may be electrically joined together by a solder connection.      Likewise, any suitable means or method may be employed to sever the leads      of engineering change network 14, as shown at 52 and 56 in FIG. 5; and,      for instance, a laser may be used to sever these lines as desired.      Moreover, it should be noted that it is not necessary to the practice of      this invention that each of the terminals 32 be directly connected to a      single one of the linking pads 20 when carrier 10 is made. For instance,      when the carrier is made, each of the terminals 32 may be directly      connected to none or to an arbitrary number of the linking pads 20; and      when it is desired to make engineering changes, joints or deletes, of the      type shown at 50 and 52, may be made to connect a given terminal 32 to a      selected one of the linking pads 20. </PAR><PAR>  As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, not every      device terminal on substrate 10 can be connected to a respective one      engineering change pad, because there are fewer engineering change pads      than device terminals. However, in any given modular circuit, not all of      the device terminals need to be connected to engineering change pads; and      assuming a randomness to the selection or choice of device terminals that      need to be connected to engineering change pads, a standard statistical      analysis shows that the arrangement of the present invention provides the      necessary flexibility in virtually every case. </PAR><PAR>  For example, on a circuit device having six hundred device terminals,      typically only 40 to 100 of the device terminals would need to be      connected to engineering change pads. A statistical analysis was performed      for each of the situations in which 40, 60, 80, and 100 device terminals      need to be reconnected via the engineering change pads. Of particular      interest is the number of groups of various numbers of adjacent device      terminals that need to be connected to engineering change pads, since a      sizeable number of large groups of such terminals could cause wiring      difficulties. </PAR><PAR>  Given n objects, the number of ways of selecting m objects, without to      order, can be expressed using the standard mathematical notation      (n.sub.m), where      ##EQU1## </PAR><PAR>  If n is the total number of device terminals on the circuit devices, and m      is the number of device terminals that would need to be reconnected, the      number, r, of groups of .alpha. adjacent device pads (where .alpha. is a      number between 2 and m), is:      ##EQU2## </PAR><PAR>  The general form for the sum, S, of all adjacencies is:      ##EQU3## </PAR><PAR>  Another factor of interest is the number of no adjacencies that may be      present. A no adjacency occurs when a device terminal that needs to be      engineering changed is between two device terminals that do not need to be      engineering changed. For example, if the device terminals are numbered 1      to 600 (with terminal 1 considered adjacent to terminal 600), a no      adjacency would be present if device terminal 2 needs to be engineering      changed, while device terminals 1 and 3 do not need to be engineering      changed; and another no adjacency would occur if device terminal 4 also      needs to be engineering changed, but device terminal 5 does not. </PAR><PAR>  Again, if n is the total number of device terminals on a circuit, and m is      the number of device terminals that need to be connected to engineering      change pads, the number, j, of no adjacencies is given by the rule:      ##EQU4## </PAR><PAR>  The probability of no adjacencies taken over all possible configurations      is,      ##EQU5## </PAR><PAR>  Given the above, the probability of adjacency groupings can be computed as,      ##EQU6## </PAR><PAR>  Table I, below, summarizes the probabilities of adjacencies of various      lengths occurring when the total number of device terminals is 600. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE I                                                          ______________________________________                                         Probability of Adjacent Terminals                                              Being Engineering Changed (for 600 Device Terminals)                                   Total number of terminals                                                      being engineering changed                                              Adjacencies of                                                                           40        60       80      100                                       ______________________________________                                         0         6.15%     0.14%     0.005% 0.00%                                     2         87.84%    90.2%    86.9%   83.5%                                     3         5.60%     8.76%    11.3%   13.74%                                    4         0.34%     0.84%    1.47%   2.24%                                     5         0.02%     0.07%    0.18%   0.36%                                     ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  Thus, in all cases, the probability that a group of five adjacent device      terminals would all need to be engineering changed is substantially less      than 1%. </PAR><PAR>  A verification test of this statistical analysis was conducted as follows.      For a total of three hundred times, numbers were drawn at random from the      number 1 to 600. In each of one hundred of these drawings, forty numbers      were drawn; in each of a second hundred of the drawings, sixty numbers      were drawn, and in each of the last one hundred drawings, eighty numbers      were drawn. The number of times 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 adjacencies occurred in      each set of drawings are shown in Table II. Again, the number 600 is      considered to be adjacent to the number 1. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE II                                                         ______________________________________                                         Number and Maximum Occurrences of                                              Selected Adjacencies in Test Drawings                                                        Adjacency of:                                                                  0    2       3      4     5                                      ______________________________________                                         100 sets of 40 drawn numbers                                                                   6      228     14   1     0                                    maximum in any one of the                                                                      1       7       1   1     0                                    100 sets                                                                       100 sets of 60 drawn numbers                                                                   0      487     38   3     0                                    maximum in any one of the                                                                      0       9       2   1     0                                    100 sets                                                                       100 sets of 80 drawn numbers                                                                   0      737     105  17    3                                    maximum in any one of the                                                                      0       17      4   2     1                                    100 sets                                                                       ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  This study shows that adjacencies of two or three are sufficiently few so      that all the desired device terminals can be engineering changed without      any wiring difficulties. </PAR><PAR>  Table II shows that in the 100 sets of 40 randomly drawn numbers, only one      group of four adjacent numbers were drawn. This adjacency is itself      sufficiently isolated so that it is expected that there would be no      difficulties in reconnecting 40 device terminals, and this result is      consistent with Table I, which shows that the probability that four      adjacent terminals would need to be engineering changed is 0.34%. In the      100 sets of 60 randomly drawn numbers, three groups of four adjacent      numbers were drawn. However, this should not present any wiring      difficulties. </PAR><PAR>  In the 100 sets of 80 randomly drawn numbers, 17 groups of four adjacent      numbers were drawn, and three groups of five adjacent numbers were drawn.      Even in most cases of five adjacent numbers, each device terminal can be      connected to a respective one engineering change pad by using connecting      pads 20, leads 26 and 30, and the inlet terminals of the engineering      change pads to form appropriate conductive paths between the device      terminals and various engineering change pads. Even in those extremely      rare cases in which each device terminal cannot be connected to a      respective one engineering change pad via connecting pads 20, leads 26 and      30, and the inlet terminals of the engineering change pads, conventional      jumper straps or wires to adjacent engineering change pads may be used to      accomplish this. Wiring rules may be formulated to determine priority      among the device terminals, or otherwise to ensure that each device      terminal is connected to a respective one engineering change pad. </PAR><PAR>  While it is apparent that the invention herein disclosed is well calculated      to fulfill the objects previously stated, it will be appreciated that      numerous modifications and embodiments may be devised by those skilled in      the art, and it is intended that the appended claims cover all such      modifications and embodiments as fall within the true spirit and scope of      the present invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
