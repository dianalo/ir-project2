The stock's decline to 55 1/8, off 1/2 yesterday, wassparked by worry about the company's FGIC municipal bondinsurance unit. The financial woes of Philadelphia remindedinvestors that municipal bond insurance isn't a theoreticalgame -- the insurers might actually have to pay significantclaims in the next year or two.</LP><TEXT>   But insuring bonds is a tiny sideline for GE. A moreserious question is the outlook for General Electric CapitalCorp., GE's huge lending arm.   Two critics, David Tice and James Grant, have recentlypredicted that GE's profit growth will slow because GECapital isn't immune to problems besetting other big lenders.   Mr. Tice, a green-eyeshade type stock analyst in Dallas,struck first with a negative article in his newsletter,Behind the Numbers. GE Capital &quot;is essentially a large moneycenter bank,&quot; Mr. Tice says. &quot;The only difference is that {GECapital} has no foreign loan exposure and does not takedeposits.&quot; As a lender, it is &quot;larger than such well-knownbanks as Bankers Trust, Bank of New York, J.P. Morgan andFirst Chicago.&quot;   Just like big banks, Mr. Tice says, GE Capital &quot;has alarge exposure to commercial real estate loans, LBO{leveraged buy-out} loans, credit-card loans and equipmentleasing.&quot;   But the average big-bank stock trades at a puny 5 to 8times per-share earnings. GE trades at nearly 12 times thepast year's per-share earnings, thereby matching the medianmultiple on the New York Stock Exchange as calculated byFactSet Data Systems.   Of course, GE has plenty of other operations: powergeneration equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives andappliances, to name a few. But Mr. Tice believes the lendingoperation is vital to GE's profit growth. As he figures it,financial services (mainly GE Capital) accounted for about24% of earnings -- and 31% of earnings growth -- in the pastfive years.   Meanwhile, in a recent newsletter, Mr. Grant warned of a&quot;likelihood of large future loan losses at GE.&quot; He said someof GE's financial ratios have worsened since 1982.Consolidated debt including the finance operation has risento 77% of equity from 30% then. Return on assets is 3.1%,down from 8.4% then. And GE Capital contributes 21% ofearnings, compared with 11.3%. GE says Mr. Grant's ratios aretechnically correct, but misleading because they combineresults for sharply different businesses. GE points out thatexcluding the financial service businesses, the company has a21% return on total capital and a 9.2% return on assets.   The two major bond rating services both give GE Capital atop triple-A rating, citing its ability to call on the parentcompany for financial support if needed. But Mr. Grant thinksthis reasoning is a bit circular, noting that GE Capital&quot;itself has contributed an ever larger share to the parent'snet income&quot; and hence &quot;is an important source of the verystrength that it may one day seek to lean against.&quot;   Lawrence Bossidy, vice chairman of GE, says, &quot;We areconfused why these people seem to be concerned.&quot; Taking abreak from a quarterly meeting with GE managers, he says inan interview that the updates presented at the Wednesdaymeeting confirmed previous projections that GE's financialservices business will post &quot;double digit&quot; growth for 1990.   GE Capital earnings grew 20% in the first half, he said,and should increase 15% to 20% in the second half: &quot;We are ontarget to meet our 1990 goals.&quot; GE as a whole also shouldreport a double-digit increase in earnings, he said.   &quot;Obviously {GE Capital is} in a turbulent industry,&quot; theexecutive says, referring to real estate and LBO lending.&quot;But we are not in the same business as the banks.&quot; He saidGE Capital is a major factor in equipment rental, and itsportfolio is different and has &quot;higher returns&quot; thantraditional bank lending.   Turmoil in the commercial real-estate market won't affectGE as badly as it does the banks, he adds. GE doesn't lend onthe basis of asset value, &quot;we lend on the value of incomefrom properties.&quot; All of GE's commercial real-estate loansare to income-producing properties, he says, and 80% of theseloans are for office buildings and apartments. &quot;We don't haveany land-development loans, construction loans or condominiumloans.&quot;   Mr. Bossidy said he expects &quot;some increases&quot; in realestate losses this year, but adds: &quot;No way will they impactGE Capital's overall operations.&quot; Commercial real estateaccounts for 14% of GE Capital's roughly $64 billionportfolio.   Leveraged buy-out loans account for another 14% of GECapital's portfolio. Mr. Bossidy says GE Capital had equitypositions in 75 companies at the end of last year. Heacknowledges that the value of the equity warrants GE holdshas decreased recently, but declines to give an estimate.Such warrants are valued on GE's books at between $750million and $1 billion.   Could the financial unit hobble the parent's earningsoutlook in the near future? Mr. Bossidy says, &quot;As best as Ican tell, that's not going to happen.&quot;   Certainly, analysts at Wall Street brokerage houses don'tseem worried. According to Zacks Investment Research, 15 of17 analysts with opinions on GE rate it a buy. The other twocall it a hold.   David Gardner at Nomura Research in June downgraded hisopinion to &quot;near-term hold and long-term attractive&quot; from&quot;short- and long-term buy,&quot; in part because the stock was &quot;ata premium.&quot; Mr. Gardner also trimmed his per-share earningsestimate for the year by 10 cents, to $4.90. But he says GE'sloans are &quot;well diversified&quot; by business and region, addingthat because GE operates in so many diverse businesses &quot;theyhave a leg up over banks in terms of analyzing credit risks.&quot;   Mark Altman, a PaineWebber analyst, rates GE stock&quot;attractive&quot; and thinks concerns about GE Capital areoverblown. He points to strong order backlogs in suchbusinesses as GE's power generation equipment, medicaldiagnostic equipment and aircraft engines. He says risingproductivity is driving profit margins higher and estimates1990 share earnings at $4.90, up from $4.36 last year.   Money managers seem to fret a bit more, but not too much.According to CDA Investment Technologies, more than 700 largemoney managers own some 447 million shares of GE stock, butthey sold, on balance, four million shares in the secondquarter.   The stock, after hitting a high of 75 1/2 in July, hassunk 27%. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average isdown about 16% from its July peak.   NWQ Investment Management in Los Angeles sold 203,000 GEshares in the second quarter, keeping 519,000, according togovernment filings. James Owen, a managing director with NWQ,says GE is a &quot;high quality core holding&quot; for individualinvestors, but may face some problems near term from GECapital, the Kidder Peabody brokerage subsidiary and the NBCtelevision network.   Money managers, he says, are subject to &quot;quarterlyparanoia&quot; as pension clients judge their performance everythree months, so they have to be concerned about the shortterm. &quot;The individual investor is free of that,&quot; he says, andcan afford to focus on GE's long-term virtues, such asdiversification, emphasis on exports and &quot;wonderfulmanagement.&quot;   Arnold Investment Counsel in Milwaukee sold all of its238,000 GE shares in May and June. David R. Aushwitz,president, says his firm bought the shares in 1988, payingabout 45 apiece, and sold at about 65 as the firm trimmed itsoverall stockholdings for fear of an &quot;unkind&quot; market. Mr.Aushwitz said concern about the status of loans made by GECapital was &quot;a small factor, but nonetheless a factor.&quot;   ---   General Electric Co.
