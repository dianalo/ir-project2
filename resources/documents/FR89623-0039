On October 14, 1988, the FAA publisheda final rule which revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirementsfor conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule:(a) Establishes a single-class TCA; (b) requires the pilot-in-command ofa civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilotcertificate, except for a student pilot who has received certain documentedtraining; and (c) eliminates the helicopter exception from the minimumnavigational equipment requirement.The FAA published a final rule on June 21, 1988, which requires Mode Cequipment when operating within 30 miles of any designated TCA primaryairport from the surface up to 10,000 feet MSL, except for operations bycertain aircraft types specifically excluded (53 FR 23356).On February 3, 1987, the FAA published a final rule which established requirementspertaining to the use, installation, inspection, and testing of Air TrafficControl Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) and Mode S transponders in U.S.-registeredcivil aircraft (53 FR 3380). The rule adopted continues to require a transponderfor operation in each TCA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The TCA program was developed to reduce the midair collision potentialin the congested airspace surrounding airports with high density air trafficby providing an area in which all aircraft will be subject to certain operatingrules and equipment requirements.The density of traffic and the type of operations being conducted in theairspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midaircollisions. In 1970, an extensive study found that the majority of midaircollisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft and an aircarrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factor commonto these conflicts was the mix of uncontrolled aircraft operating undervisual flight rules (VFR) and controlled aircraft operating under instrumentflight rules (IFR). TCA's provide a method to accommodate the increasingnumber of IFR and VFR operations. The regulatory requirements of TCA airspaceafford the greatest protection for the greatest number of people by providingATC with an increased capability to provide aircraft separation service,thereby minimizing the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft.To date, the FAA has established a total of 23 TCA's. The FAA is proposingto take action to modify or implement the application of these proven controltechniques to more airports to provide greater protection of air trafficin the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft.On August 22, 1987, the Secretary of Transportation announced nine locationsfor which the FAA would issue Notices proposing the establishment of TCA's.The nine candidates cited qualify for TCA status by meeting the criteriapublished in FAA Handbook 7400.2C, ``Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters.''The criteria for establishing a TCA are based on factors which includethe number of aircraft and people using that airspace, the traffic density,and the type or nature of operations being conducted. Accordingly, guidelineshave been established to identify TCA locations based on two elements_thenumber of enplaned passengers and the number of aircraft operations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pre-NPRM Public Input</ITAG>Airspace MeetingsInformal airspace meetings were held in the Salt Lake City area on October4, 5, and 6, 1988. The FAA received 23 written comments as a result ofthese meetings. These comments were from congressional offices, countyoffices, military organizations, aviation organizations/services, airportmanagement and individual pilots. All comments received were in referenceto the FAA TCA proposal presented at the informal airspace meetings. Inaddition to the comments, the FAA received a TCA proposal from the AirportsSystem Planning Advisory Committee (ASPAC). This committee represents 25aviation organizations in the Salt Lake City area. All comments received,along with FAA analyses, are summarized as follows:1. Two major airlines supported the 12,500-foot MSL ceiling proposed bythe FAA, while several independent airspace users favored a lower ceiling.These independent users stated that a 12,500-foot MSL ceiling would betoo restrictive for pilots not wishing to participate in the TCA. The ASPACTCA design proposed a ceiling of 10,000 feet MSL.After considering all comments, the FAA is proposing a 10,000-foot TCAceiling.2. Several commenters were concerned that the proposed eastern boundarywould force those aircraft not wishing to participate in the TCA too closeto high terrain.Since this is a known VFR transit area, the FAA moved the proposed boundarywest to a longitudinal line of 111anddegrees;45andmin172;00&quot; W. This will allowVFR aircraft ample room to navigate around the TCA as well as over highterrain.3. Several commenters requested a ``cutout'' around the Salt Lake SkyparkAirport. Commenters indicated that the FAA proposal would hamper trainingoperations for aircraft based at the Salt Lake Skypark Airport.This area is not involved in the major traffic flows for the primary airport;therefore, the FAA is proposing an exclusion of that portion of airspacesurrounding the Salt Lake Skypark Airport below 5,300 feet MSL. This exclusionwill allow aircraft to depart, land, and operate around Skypark Airportwithout entering the TCA.4. Some commenters requested that the proposed TCA be delineated by prominentvisual landmarks.The FAA has altered the proposed TCA boundaries using available visuallandmarks while ensuring that the TCA conforms to the desired TCA configuration.5. Tooele County officials requested that the FAA delete the Tooele ValleyAirport from the proposed TCA. This exclusion would accommodate all generalaviation pilots who do not wish to participate, circumnavigate, or flybeneath the TCA.After analyzing this request, the FAA altered the proposed TCA boundariesin this area by deleting the Tooele Valley Airport from the proposed TCA.6. Several commenters complained that the proposed TCA extends to 30 milesfrom the primary airport.The FAA reduced the proposed TCA boundaries. The boundaries proposed inthe Notice extend to 25 miles from the primary airport in certain areas.These areas are needed to provide the best service for aircraft transitioningin and out of the Salt Lake City International Airport.7. The FAA received one request for a corridor-type TCA.The FAA conducted a test of ``climb and descent corridors'' in the Boston,MA, area. It was concluded that corridors do not provide the desired degreeof safety nor the most efficient use of airspace necessary to contain aircraftin high density terminal areas.8. One suggestion was received to exclude airspace northwest of the primaryairport below 5,500 feet MSL outside the Salt Lake City Control Zone fromthe inner core of the TCA to allow low-level operations.Such low-level operations can be conducted within TCA airspace. In addition,air traffic control services provide separation which would create a saferenvironment.9. Cedar Valley Airport operators requested that the FAA delete Cedar ValleyAirport from the TCA proposal. Excluding Cedar Valley Airport will ensurethat current sport-related aviation procedures will remain unchanged. As a result of these comments, the FAA considered this request and alteredthe TCA proposal to exclude Cedar Valley Airport from the TCA design. 10. Some commenters requested that the shelf over the Salt Lake City Municipal2 Airport be altered to reflect an even altitude. Commenters stated thatthe proposed floor restricts the number of available altitudes for VFRflight beneath the floor of the TCA.  The FAA raised the proposed floor in this area up to 6,000 feet MSL toallow VFR aircraft an additional 2,000 feet.  11. Several commenters expressed concern that the TCA floor west of Morganprecludes VFR flight. Commenters stated that a combination of high terrainand a low floor creates an unsafe environment for VFR aircraft.  The proposed boundary in this area was altered to delete the airspace eastof the Hill Air Force Base and Ogden Municipal Airport Airport TrafficAreas (ATA).  12. United States Air Force representatives expressed concern that implementinga TCA may impede military operations.  The military operations addressed will be accommodated through inter-facilityagreements. The FAA contends that a TCA will result in a safer environmentfor both civil and military aircraft.  <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposal  </ITAG>The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish a TCA at Salt Lake City InternationalAirport, UT. In 1987, the total number of annual enplaned passengers atSalt Lake City International Airport was 4,895,326 which exceeds the 3.5million necessary for consideration as a TCA candidate. The total numberof airport operations were 292,050, over 50 percent of which were air carrier.Additionally, within the proposed boundaries, more than 750,000 flightoperations are conducted annually. Consequently, the FAA has determinedthat establishment of a TCA at Salt Lake City International Airport isin the interest of flight safety and will result in a greater degree ofprotection for the greater number of people during flight in that terminalarea. Salt Lake City International Airport is currently served by an ARSA,which would be rescinded concurrent with the establishment of this TCA.The proposed location is depicted on the attached chart.  Section 91.90 of Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part91) defines TCA's and prescribes operating rules for aircraft in airspacedesignated as a TCA. The TCA rule provides, in part, that prior to enteringthe TCA, any pilot arriving at any airport within the TCA or flying througha TCA must: (1) Obtain appropriate authorization from ATC; (2) comply withapplicable procedures established by ATC for pilot training operationsat an airport within a TCA; (3) hold at least a private pilot certificate;(4) meet the requirements of andSection;61.95 if the aircraft is operatedby a student pilot. Any aircraft arriving at any airport within the TCAor flying through a TCA must: have an operable VOR or TACAN receiver; havean operable two-way radio capable of communications with ATC on appropriatefrequencies for that TCA; and be equppped with the applicable operatingtransponder and automatic altitude reporting equipment specified in paragraph(a) of andSection;91.24, except as provided in paragraph (d) of that section.Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all large turbine-engine-powered aircraftoperating to or from a primary airport must be operated above the designatedfloors of the TCA. The pilot of any aircraft departing from an airportlocated within a TCA is required to receive a clearance from ATC priorto takeoff.  All aircraft operating within a TCA are required to comply with all ATCclearances and instructions, and any FAA arrival or departure traffic patternfor the airport of intended operation. However, the rule permits ATC toauthorize deviations from any of the operating requirements of the rulewhen safety considerations justify the deviation or more efficient utilizationof the airspace can be attained. Ultralight vehicle operations and parachutejumps in a TCA may only be conducted under the terms of an ATC authorization.  Definitions, operating requirements, and specific airspace designationsapplicable to TCA's may be found in andSection;andSection;71.12, 71.401, and71.403 of Part 71 (14 CFR Part 71); and Sections 91.1 and 91.90 of Part91 (14 CFR Part 91).  The standard configuration of a TCA consists of three concentric circlescentered on the primary airport extending to 10, 20, and 30 miles respectively.The vertical limits of the TCA are 12,500 feet above MSL, with the floorestablished at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriateto containment of operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteriamay be authorized contingent upon terrain, adjacent regulatory airspace,and factors unique to the terminal area. The airspace configuration containedherein is the result of an extensive staff study conducted by the localFAA authority after obtaining public input from informal airspace meetingsand coordinating with the FAA regional office. The FAA has determined thefollowing proposed TCA airspace configuration is consistent with TCA objectivesand allows consideration of terminal area flight operations and terrain: 1. That airspace extending upward from the surface up to and including10,000 feet MSL, beginning at a point where the 13-mile arc of the SaltLake City International Airport Runway 16 ILS (I_MOY) localizer/distancemeasuring equipment (LOC/DME) antenna intercepts Interstate 15 (I-15),extending south on I-15 until intercepting the Salt Lake City InternationalAirport ATA, extending south along the Salt Lake City International AirportATA boundary until intercepting I-15, extending south on I-15 until interceptingthe 11-mile arc on the I-MOY LOC/DME antenna clockwise until interceptingthe Union Pacific railroad tracks, extending southwest along the UnionPacific railroad tracks until intercepting the 13-mile arc of the I-MOYLOC/DME antenna clockwise until the point of beginning. This airspace isneeded to contain aircraft departing from and arriving at the primary airport.The reduced areas to the north and south provide sufficient airspace forskydiving, gliders, etc.2. That airspace extending upward from 7,600 feet MSL up to and including10,000 feet MSL between the 13-mile radius and the 25-mile radius of theI-MOY LOC/DME antenna, excluding that airspace south of the Union Pacificrailroad tracks, and that airspace beginning at a point where the 25-milearc intercepts the Hill AFB ATA and U.S. Highway 89. This segment of airspaceallows for terrain clearance and is necessary for climb and descent intothe primary airport.  3. That airspace extending upward from 7,000 feet MSL up to an including10,000 feet MSL, beginning at a point where the 11-mile arc of the I-MOYLOC/DME antenna intercepts a line at long. 112anddegrees;09andmin172;00&quot; W.,bounded on the west by a line at long. 112anddegrees;09andmin172;00&quot; W., onthe south by a line at lat. 40anddegrees;27andmin172;30&quot; N., to a point atlat. 40anddegrees;27andmin172;30&quot; N., long. 112anddegrees;00andmin172;30&quot; W., extendingnorth to a point at lat. 40anddegrees;35andmin172;30&quot; N., long. 112anddegrees;00andmin172;00&quot;W., on a 11-mile arc of the I-MOY LOC/DME antenna; and that airspace directlyeast of the previously described area and west of I-15 extending upwardfrom 6,000 feet MSL up to and including 10,000 feet MSL; and that airspacesouth of the 7,000 to 10,000 feet MSL area and 6,000 to 10,000 feet MSLarea north of a line at lat. 40anddegrees;23andmin172;30&quot; N., west of a lineat long. 112anddegrees;09andmin172;00&quot; W., east of I-15 extending upward from9,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL, excluding Restricted AreasR-6412A and R-6412B when active. This airspace is configured for terrainclearance and areas limited in radar and radio coverage.  4. That airspace extending upward from 9,000 feet MSL up to and including10,000 feet MSL east of I-15, south of Interstate 84 west of a line atlong. 111anddegrees;45andmin172;00&quot; W., and north of a line at lat. 40anddegrees;31andmin172;30&quot;N. This airspace is configured for terrain clearance east of Salt LakeCity International Airport.   The preceding general summary of the proposed TCA airspace configurationidentifies that airspace which is necessary to contain large turbojet aircraftoperations at Salt Lake City International Airport. ATC will provide controland separation of all flights within the proposed airspace boundaries.Furthermore, ATC authorization is requisite to aircraft operations withinthat airspace. Establishment of this TCA will greatly enhance the safetyof flight within the congested airspace overlying the Salt Lake City metropolitanarea by facilitating the separation of controlled and uncontrolled flightoperations. Section 71.403 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulationswas republished in Handbook 7400.6E dated Jaunary 3, 1989.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary  </ITAG>The FAA is required to assess the benefits and costs of each proposed rulemakingaction to assure that the public is not burdened with rules having costswhich outweigh their benefits. This section contains an analysis whichquantifies, to the maximum possible extend, the costs and benefits of establishinga TCA at Salt Lake City, UT. This regulatory evaluation summary shouldbe read in conjunction with the NPRM since it provides additional backgroundinformation.  This proposal is intended to lower the likelihood of midair collisionsby increasing the capability of the ATC system to separate all aircraftin terminal airspace around the Salt Lake City International Airport. Thisaction was prompted by data indicating that a high percentage of near midaircollisions reported to the FAA in terminal areas involve VFR aircraft thatare not required to be under the control of ATC. Thus, the overall objectiveof this proposal is to substantially increase safety while accommodatingthe ligitimate concerns of airspace users.  Costs-Benefits Analysis  <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Costs  </ITAG>The FAA estimates the total cost expected to accrue from implementationof the proposed rule to be $4.4 million ($2.6 million, discounted, 15 years)in 1987 dollars. Approximately $2.5 million (discounted) or 97 percentof the total estimated costs would be incurred by the FAA primarily foradditional personnel. The remaining costs would be incurred by small GAaircraft operators who would be required under this proposal to equip theiraircraft with Mode C transponders sooner than they would have for the ARSAunder the previous FAA rule: ``Transponder With Automatic Altitude ReportingCapability Requirement (Mode C)'' (53 FR 23356, June 21, 1988). This rulebecame effective June 21, 1988, and will be implemented in two phases.Phase I, to begin in July 1989, will require a transponder with Mode Cat and above 10,000 feet MSL and in the vicinity (30 nautical miles) ofTCA primary airports. There are currently 23 TCA's.   Phase II will implement a transponder with Mode C requirement in the airspacein the vicinity (10 nautical miles) of ARSA primary airports. Phase IIbecomes effective on December 30, 1990, and will affect over 135 ARSA's.Also in Phase II, a transponder with Mode C will be required at other designatedairports for which either a TCA or ARSA has not been adopted. Consequently,most aircraft without Mode C transponders would need ATC authorizationto fly within 30 nautical miles of a TCA primary airport, within 10 nauticalmiles of an ARSA primary airport, or within controlled airspace of otherdesignated airports that would also require Mode C transponders.   Thus, this evaluation, as well as the Mode C rule, assumes that all aircraftwithout Mode C would acquire such equipment rather than circumnavigatethe subject airport. The only aircraft without this equipment would benonelectrical and antique types. Costs to those types of aircraft operatorshave already been accounted for by the Mode C rule. As a result, aircraftoperators impacted by this proposal would only incur the opportunity costof capital by requiring them to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transpondersone year earlier than they would be required to do so in accordance withPhase II of the Mode C rule.  <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Benefits  </ITAG>This proposed rule is expected to generate potential benefits primarilyin the form of enhanced safety to the aviation community and the flyingpublic. Such safety, for instance, would take the form of reduced casualtylosses (namely, aviation fatalities and property damage) resulting froma lowered likelihood of midair collisions due to increased positive controlin airspace to be established by the TCA. In addition, potential benefitsare expected to accrue in the form of improved operational efficiency onthe part of FAA air traffic controllers.  Ordinarily, the potential benefits of this proposal would be the reductionin the probability of midair collisions resulting from converting the existingARSA to a TCA. However, due to the recent Mode C rule (and to some extent,the rule for Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance (TCAS), 54 FR 940, January10, 1989). the number of potential midair collisions avoided by this proposalis expected to be significantly lower. Nevertheless, this proposal is stillexpected to accrue benefits in terms of enhanced safety, though on a muchsmaller scale.This point can be illustrated with the use of statistical models basedon actual and projected critical near midair collision (NMAC) incidentsin lieu of actual midair collisions. (A critical NMAC is an event involvingtwo aircraft coming within 100 feet of each other; the fact that they donot collide is not due to an action on the part of either pilot but, rather,is due purely to chance.) Since midair collisions involving Part 135 aircraftand especially Part 121 aircraft are rare, the use of critical NMAC's willserve to illustrate, to some degree, the potential improvements in aviationsafety of implementing this proposal.Simple regression analyses were prepared for this evaluation which focusedon critical NMAC's and aircraft operations in the 23 existing TCA's andin a random sample of 23 of the existing 79 ARSA's (as of 1986 and 1987).The results of these analyses indicated that TCA's have approximately 68percent fewer critical NMAC's annually, on average, than ARSA's. Whilethere is no demonstrated relationship between NMAC's and actual midaircollisions, the lower NMAC rate does indicate a more efficient separationof aircraft in congested airspace.As the result of these findings, if the existing Salt Lake City ARSA wereto remain unchanged (and the recent Mode C and TCAS rules were not in effect),the Salt Lake City Terminal Area would be expected to experience approximately2.1 critical NMAC's annually (or 31 critical NMAC's over the next 15 years).If, however, the ARSA were to become a TCA, this figure would reduce toapproximately 0.7 critical NMAC's annually (or 11 critical NMAC's overthe next 15 years). Thus, over the next 15 years, this proposal could resultin the reduction of approximately 21 critical NMAC's. However, it is importantto note that many, if not most, of these potential critical NMAC's wouldnever materialize as predicted primarily because of the ``Mode C'' ruleas it is applied to the Salt Lake City ARSA and, to some extent, the ``TCAS''rule.According to Phase II of the Mode C rule, all aircraft operating within10 nautical miles (except for flights under the outer 5-mile ``shelf'')of an ARSA primary airport must be equipped with a Mode C Transponder.Phase I of the Mode C rule requires, as of July 1989, aircraft operatingwithin 30 nautical miles of a TCA to be equipped with a Mode C transponder.These requirements are expected to significantly reduce the risk of midaircollisions in ARSA's and TCA's. For this reason, the primary safety benefitof this proposal to create a TCA in 1989 at Salt Lake City is that thesafety enhancements of the Mode C and TCAS requirements will occur oneyear earlier than would be otherwise expected without this proposal. Asecond safety benefit would be in terms of the lowered likelihood of midaircollisions as a result of expanding the lateral boundaries of positiveATC by 20 nautical miles through replacing the Salt Lake City ARSA witha TCA.Thus, the safety benefits of the establishment of a new TCA, while positive,would be less than would otherwise accrue in the absence of the Mode Cand TCAS rules. Since this proposal essentially extends the effects ofthe Mode C rule, virtually all of its potential safety benefits are assumedto be part of that rule. Such benefits cannot be estimated separately and,therefore, are considered to be inextricably linked primarily to the ModeC rule. Over a 15-year period, the Mode C rule is expected to generatetotal potential safety benefits of $344 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars).(The Mode C rule benefits estimate of $310 million for 10 years has beenadjusted to a 15-year period for the purpose of comparability with theTCAS rule and other FAA rulemaking actions.) It is important to note thatpart of these safety benefits would be attributed to the TCAS rule. Thus,the potential safety benefits of this proposal, and the Mode C and TCASrules are considered to be inextricably linked.Another potential benefit of the proposed rule would be improved operationalefficiency on the part of FAA air traffic controllers. Under the proposedrule, Mode C transponder requirements would ease controller workload asa result of aircraft being controlled due to a reduction in radio communications.The proposed rule would also make potential traffic conflicts more readilyapparent to the controller. As the result of improved operational efficiency,the impact of controller workload increased by separation requirementsin the proposed TCA would be somewhat offset due to the controller's abilityto adjust the volume of VFR traffic in any given portion of the TCA.Improved operational efficiency should generate other types of benefitsin the form of significant reductions in the number of VFR aircraft requestsdenied and VFR aircraft delayed during the busy periods. As the resultof converting the existing Salt Lake City ARSA to a TCA, the improved operationalefficiency would accrue due to the availability of additional air trafficcontrollers. If the Salt Lake City ARSA were to remain intact, such airtraffic personnel would not be required. Therefore, potential benefitsof improved operational efficiency, which are not considered to be quantifiablein monetary terms in this evaluation, would be attributed to this proposalrather than either the Mode C rule or TCAS rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Comparison of Benefits and Costs</ITAG>The total cost that would accrue from implementation of the proposed ruleis estimated to be $2.6 million (discounted, in 1987 dollars). Approximately,3 percent of this total cost estimate would fall on those GA aircraft operatorswithout Mode C transponders in the form of opportunity costs by requiringthem to acquire such avionics equipment, including maintenance, one yearsooner than they otherwise would under the status quo. The typical individualGA aircraft operator impacted would incur an estimated one-time cost rangingfrom $86 to $191 (discounted) under the proposed rule. (As a result ofthe opportunity cost concept, the derivation of these cost estimates aretoo complex to discuss briefly. Therefore, the reader should refer to thedetailed regulatory evaluation, which is contained in the docket, for afull explanation of the method by which these costs estimates were made.)The potential benefits of the proposed rule would be the lowered likelihoodof midair collisions from the conversion of the existing ARSA to a TCA.The number of midair collisions avoided and their respective monetary valuescannot be estimated for this proposal independent of the Mode C and TCASrules, but the FAA believes the risk would be substantially reduced. AnFAA analysis prepared for this evaluation, however, has shown that criticalnear midair collisions occur approximately two-thirds less frequently ina TCA than within an ARSA. The FAA believes that even after the aviationcommunity complies with the Mode C and TCAS rules, locations convertingfrom ARSA's to TCA's would continue to experience reduced critical NMAC's.In addition, the proposed rule would generate improved operational efficiencybenefits on the part of FAA air traffic controllers, though they are notconsidered to be quantifiable in monetary terms.Clearly, in view of the cost of compliance relative to the significantreduction in the likelihood of midair collisions as well as improved operationalefficiency in the Salt Lake City Terminal Area, the FAA firmly believesthe proposed rule is cost-beneficial.The Regulatory Evaluation that has been placed in the docket contains additionaldetailed information related to the costs and benefits that are expectedto accrue from the implementation of this NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure thatsmall entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened byGovernment regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules whichmay have ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.''The small entities which could be potentially affected by the implementationof this proposed rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire whoown nine or fewer aircraft.Virtually all of the aircraft operators impacted by this proposed rulewould be those who acquire Mode C transponder capability. The FAA believesthat all unscheduled aircraft operators (namely, air taxi operators) potentiallyimpacted by this proposed rule already have Mode C transponders due tothe fact that such operators fly regularly in or near airports where radarapproach control service has been established. Even if some of these operatorswere to acquire, install, and maintain Mode C transponders, the cost wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of them.The annual FAA threshold for significant economic impact is $3,700 (1987dollars) for a small entity. According to FAA Order 2100.14A (RegulatoryFlexibility Criteria and Guidance), the definition of a small entity, interms of an air taxi operator, is one with nine aircraft owned, but notnecessarily operated.If we were to assume that a particular aircraft operator had nine aircraftwithout transponders, then the annual one-time cost per impacted aircraftwould be approximately $210 (undiscounted, for the purpose of comparabilitywith the figure of $3,700). The total annual one-time cost per small entitywould amount to an estimated $1,890. Thus, the annual worst case cost fora small entity would fall far below the FAA's annual threshold of $3,700.Therefore, the FAA believes this proposed rule would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">International Trade Impact Assessment </ITAG>The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviationproducts or services in the United States, nor would it have an effecton the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries. This isbecause the proposed rule would only potentially impact small GA aircraftoperators without Mode C, and not aircraft manufacturers. The average costof acquiring Mode C capability is estimated to range from $900 (to upgradefrom a Mode A transponder) to $2,000 (to acquire a Mode C transponder withouthaving a Mode A transponder). The cost of acquiring Mode C capability isnot considered to be high enough to discourage potential buyers of smallGA airplanes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>The proposed regulation would not have substantial direct effect on thestates, on the relationship between the national government and the states,or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the variouslevels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612,preparation of a Federalism assessment is not warranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed under ``Regulatory Evaluation,'' the FAA hasdetermined that this proposed regulation is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291. This rulemaking is considered a ``significant rule''under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979). It is certified that this proposal, if adopted, would not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Terminal control areas and airport radar service areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to amend Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 71) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
