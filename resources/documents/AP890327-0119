A Foreign Ministry spokesman would not rule out the possibility,however, that the guerrillas were regrouping to continue the fightat Jalalabad, their first major offensive since Soviet militaryforces withdrew Feb. 15.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a guerrilla group claimed 53 soldierswere killed and five aircraft shot down in weekend fighting aroundthe strategic city on the main road from Kabul to the Pakistaniborder.   The Afghan News Agency, associated with rebel leader GulbaddinHekmatyar, said insurgents had captured several army posts north ofJalalabad in heavy fighting since Saturday.   It gave no figures on guerrilla casualties, but on Sunday theofficial Afghan radio said nearly 350 were killed. Claims by thetwo sides usually conflict, and no independent confirmation ispossible.   Mohammad Nabi Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman in Kabul,said guerrillas fired only 250 rockets and shells at Jalalabad inthe 24-hour period ending at sundown Monday, compared with 12,000in the previous 24 hours.   ``Our armed forces detected their place of attack and shelled(them),'' he told reporters. ``As a result, 190 of the extremistswere killed and 70 were wounded.''   He said two government soldiers and three civilians were killedand five soldiers and nine civilians wounded.   ``Extremists'' is what the government calls the guerrillas whobegqan fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Sovietsoldiers arrived in December 1979, and an estimated 115,000 were inAfghanistan when the U.N.-mediated withdrawal began last May.   Despite the lull he reported in fighting at Jalalabad, 75 mileseast of Kabul, Amani said it was too soon for foreign journaliststo visit.   Asked whether the reported decline in guerrilla activity couldmean they were regrouping for a fresh attack, he said: ``We're ofthe opinion that they are drawing a conclusion that they cannotachieve any success through military means,'' but whether theywould attack again was open to question.   A guerrilla victory there would give them control of their firstmajor city and provide a base for the ``interim government'' theyelected Feb. 23 in Pakistan.   ``Except for minor military activities in border provinces,including Herat, the rest of the nation led a very calm and quietlife,'' and at Jalalabad the attacks are ``weakening anddisintegrating,'' he said.   Herat is near the the border with Iran, Afghanistan's neighborto the west and the base for eight predominantly Shiite Mosleminsurgent groups. The Shiites frequently are at odds with the sevenpredominantly Sunni Moslem groups that operate from Pakistan.   Amani claimed Pakistani miitiamen and advisers from Saudi Arabiahad been killed fighting with the guerrillas, but he gave nofigures. Abdul Haq, a rebel commander outside Kabul, claimed in areport mailed to news organizaions that Indian military advisersand pilots were with Afghan forces near the Soviet border.   Officials in Kabul often claim Pakistani troops, along with U.S.and Saudi military advisers, help the insurgents. All threecountries acknowledge supporting the guerrillas but deny directinvolvement.   Previous guerrilla reports have said Indian and Soviet pilotswere bombing their forces, but both countries deny it.   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said he was incorrctly informedSunday when he told reporters all passengers on two small buseswere killed by guerrilla rocket attacks. He said ``a number''survived and were in Kabul hospitals.   One attack occurred on the Jalalabad-Kabul highway and the otheron the road linking kabul with the northeastern province ofLaghman, Amani said.   Kabul, a city of 2.2 million, was quiet Monday and has been fora week.</TEXT></DOC>
