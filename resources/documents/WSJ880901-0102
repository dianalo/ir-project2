The dead were six crew members and a Hong Kong passenger who died of his injuries in a hospital.    The crew members' bodies were found in the front part of the British-made Trident, which was submerged just off Kai Tak International Airport's only runway, said a divisional fire commander.    The jetliner, operated by Civil Aviation Administration of China, the nation's flag carrier, skidded off the runway in a rainstorm at 9:19 a.m. as it landed on a flight from Canton, capital of China's southern Guangdong province, about 90 miles to the northwest.    Fifteen of the 89 people on board Flight 301 were injured, including two of the 12 American passengers, said the airline, known as CAAC. Thirteen people were hospitalized in fair and satisfactory condition.    Radio Television Hong Kong said that besides the Americans, the injured included three Chinese crew members, seven passengers from Hong Kong, two from Taiwan and a Frenchman. Hospital aides identified one of the injured as Heung Cheuk-Wu, a 38-year-old Chinese-American.    &quot;You know, today the weather is not very good,&quot; CAAC station manager Chen Zhengyou said when asked about the cause of the crash.    Hong Kong officials launched an investigation. A London spokesman for British Aerospace PLC, which makes the Trident, said the company offered to help. </TEXT></DOC>
