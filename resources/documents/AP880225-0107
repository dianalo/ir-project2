A British Embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said the Iraqi president pardoned John Smith on Wednesday as DavidMellor, a British Foreign Office minister, held talks with Iraqiofficials.   In London, the Foreign Office said Mellor delivered a letter tothe Iraqi president from Mrs. Thatcher asking for his help inobtaining Smith's release.   It said 46-year-old Smith of Hazelmere in Lancashire had notbeen released yet. ``We don't expect it to be too long. There arebureaucratic procedures to complete,'' said a spokesman.   The Foreign Office said Smith's release ``is the happyculmination of a number of efforts over a number of years.'' Itadded that ``no deals have been struck.''   The Iraqi officials accused of being involved with Smith weretried and executed.   Smith, managing director of the specialist vehicle manufacturerHestair Dennis, was arrested in 1979 while talking with an Iraqiofficial in a park.   He was convicted in 1980 of bribing officials and sentenced tolife imprisonment, which in Iraq means 20 years.   At the time he was also accused of ``economic espionage'' but itwas not clear whether he was ever formally charged or convicted onsuch a charge.   The Iraqis convicted in the case were executed according to anIraqi law that prohibits receiving bribes from foreign salesman orproviding them with information related to the state.   Another British businessman, Ian Rechter, is imprisoned in Iraqafter being tried in 1987 and convicted of bribing the mayor ofBaghdad, who was found guilty of taking bribes from Rechter andlater executed.   Mellor also pressed for Rechter's release but no decision hasyet been taken by Iraqi authorities.</TEXT></DOC>
