Once before, in 1973, asuspicious mammogram had led to a surgical breast biopsy. Thebiopsy involved a day in the hospital, general anesthesia anda painful, inch-long incision that took two weeks to heal.   This time, however, the 45-year-old Conifer, Colo., womanwalked into a radiology clinic in Denver at 11 a.m. oneWednesday and walked out two hours later. She had sufferednothing more than a needle puncture, rendered almost painlessby a local anesthetic, and by Friday she knew the lesion wasbenign. &quot;I'm a technical person and I'm not put off bymachines,&quot; says Ms. Grove, a microbiologist. &quot;But I was justblown away by this technique.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In the last several months, the new approach, calledstereotactic automated large-core biopsy, has beenencountered by a small but growing number of women.Proponents say it is faster, cheaper, less painful and lessdisfiguring than the conventional surgical biopsy that500,000 American women undergo each year.   &quot;The patients uniformly say there is a minimum of pain andthat they would be willing to undergo it again, which theydon't say with surgical biopsy,&quot; says Jack Meyer, professorof radiology at Harvard Medical School. In the last fivemonths, Dr. Meyer has used the technique to perform biopsieson more than 60 women at the Brigham and Women's Hospital inBoston as part of a study. &quot;The surgeons who have referredpatients to me are pleased with the results,&quot; he says.   Dr. Meyer also praises the speed of the new method. Manywomen, he says, find it almost intolerable to wait for daysand even weeks for a surgical biopsy.   But some researchers worry that many radiologists, who seea chance to profitably invade a turf occupied by surgeons,may be rushing to offer the new biopsy method far too soon,before its limitations and hazards are fully known.   Stereotactic breast biopsy uses stereoscopic X-raymammograms to pinpoint in three dimensions the location of asuspicious lump that has shown up in a mammogram. A computerhelps aim a springloaded &quot;gun&quot; that shoots a hollow-coreneedle into the lesion in a fraction of a second. The needlepulls out a &quot;core&quot; of tissue large enough for a pathologistto determine the nature of the lump.   With the new technique, the biopsy procedure itself takesonly about 20 minutes, and improvements in the works may cutthat to less than 10 minutes. If a radiologist and a surgeonare available to evaluate a routine mammogram immediately,the stereotactic biopsy can be done on the same day and evenin the same radiology clinic. In contrast, the conventionalsurgical biopsy requires scheduling days ahead of time andfive to six hours in a hospital under general anesthesia.   To top it off, the stereotactic needle biopsy typicallycosts $750 to $1,000, a half to a third of the cost of asurgical biopsy.   The idea of needle biopsy -- the sampling of tissue with athin, hollow needle -- is hardly new; it is widely and almostroutinely used to help diagnose tumors in many parts of thebody. But until now, it has been of limited value in breastcancer. At most, surgeons have sometimes inserted anultrathin needle into a suspicious breast lump to see if itis filled with fluid, a feature of a benign cyst.   Most breast surgeons, though, have shunned needle breastbiopsies of suspicious lumps as unreliable. If a breast lumpis large enough to be palpable, or felt, there is always theworry that the needle may miss the malignant cells in thelump, resulting in a dangerous &quot;false negative.&quot; For suchlarge lumps, surgical excision biopsy is likely to continueto be the main method of diagnosis.   It's another matter, however, for the nonpalpable lesionsthat are usually first detected by mammography during routinehealth checkups. In 80% to 90% of the cases, these tiny lumpsare benign. But a great many women have had to undergoexpensive, painful and sometimes disfiguring surgicalbiopsies just to make sure.   This situation began to change in the 1980s, when makersof X-ray machinery devised mammography equipment that couldtake mammograms from two angles 30 degrees apart. Theresulting stereotactic views could locate a breast lump inthree dimensions and thus allowed radiologists and surgeonsfor the first time to accurately guide a needle into a lump.   Using this &quot;stereo&quot; feature, researchers beganexperimenting with needle biopsies of nonpalpable breastlumps. The results were promising, but there were enoughdrawbacks to discourage wide use. Even when the skinny needlegot enough cells to examine, there was always a worry thatthe needle might have plunged into normal cells in the lumpand missed the malignant cells. Moreover, a specially trainedcytologist -- who had to be hired by the hospital -- couldtell doctors whether the cells were malignant but couldn'tdetermine what type of growth they came from -- a guide totreatment.   The turning point, say researchers, came last August witha report by a team of radiologists headed by Steve H. Parkerand William E. Jobe of Radiology Imaging Associates, theprivate radiology clinic in Englewood, Colo., where Ms. Groveunderwent her needle biopsy last month.   Dr. Parker says that in 1987 he was doing a lot of needlebiopsies of cancers of the prostate, liver and other organsusing a spring-loaded &quot;gun&quot; developed in Sweden and sold by aunit of C.R. Bard andamp; Co. The gun could shoot a needle straightinto a tumor in seven-thousandths of a second, before thetumor could be pushed out of the way by the advancing needletip.   Dr. Parker found that the accuracy of cancer detection wasgreatly improved if he used a &quot;core&quot; needle that was muchwider than the aspiration needle. &quot;After I published anarticle {on the core biopsy}, William Jobe called me up andasked me if I thought it could be used in the breast,&quot; Dr.Parker recalls. A short while later, the two radiologistsbegan a trial with women who agreed to have a core needlebiopsy just before they underwent a scheduled surgicalbiopsy.   In the first series of patients, Drs. Parker and Jobefound a problem with the mammography machine from GeneralElectric Co. they were using. The GE system, like most othermammography systems, requires the patient to sit still andupright for a half-hour or so. If the woman has aninvoluntary muscle jerk at the wrong time, the needle canmiss the lump. Moreover, the patient can see the needle beinginserted, and there was worry the sight might make some womenfaint.   After their first 30 patients, Drs. Parker and Jobeswitched to a &quot;stereo&quot; mammography machine that was designedin Sweden but made by a small Denver company, Fischer ImagingCorp. With this machine, the woman lies face down on a tablewith her breast protruding through a hole, and the needle gunis out of sight.   After biopsies on 103 patients, the radiologists reachedthe point where their needle biopsies were getting the sameresults as surgical biopsies. In a second series of 102patients, their results agreed with the surgical biopsyresults 96% of the time, the researchers reported in Augustin the journal Radiology. The needle biopsy missed two breastlesions that the surgeons found later -- but the surgeonsmissed two lesions that needle biopsies found.   Radiologists have bought more than 100 of the $120,000Fischer Mammotest systems since early 1990, says Fischer'schief executive, Morgan Nields. Spurred by the reports ofDrs. Parker and Jobe, &quot;the rate of orders has increased everyquarter,&quot; he says. He estimates other manufacturers have sold200 stereotactic &quot;add-ons&quot; that permit their mammographysystems to be used for needle biopsies.   That may be a problem, though, because academicresearchers still haven't had time to identify the best wayto use the technique or the type of patient who is mostlikely to benefit. &quot;There aren't enough reports published&quot;evaluating the new method, says radiologist Daniel Kopans ofMassachusetts General Hospital in Boston. &quot;We need to knowthat Steve Parker isn't the only one who can do this.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
