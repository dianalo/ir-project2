Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua, in a weekly briefingdevoid of the anti-American rhetoric common in recent months, alsosaid he hoped U.S.-China ties, badly strained by the June militarycrackdown on pro-democracy dissent in which hundreds of protesterswere killed, could be normalized soon.   Jin, however, declined to say whether China would make anyconcessions or change its policies as a result of the weekend visitby National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, the first senior U.S.official to visit China since Bush banned high-level exchanges inJune.   Democratic congressmen have sharply criticized the visit,accusing Bush of ``kowtowing'' to Chinese leaders responsible forthe bloody quelling of the Tiananmen protest movement.   ``We appreciate President Bush's action to send his emissary Mr.Scowcroft to China for a visit,'' Jin said.   ``The Chinese government sets great store by the Sino-U.S.relations, and believes that with joint efforts, China and theUnited States will be entirely able to overcome the existingdifficulties and restore to normal soon their relations and evenpush them to further development.''   Asked about Fang, who took sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy withhis wife after troops crushed the student movement in June, Jinsaid: ``That's a sensitive question involving China's sovereigntylaw and norms of international law.''   In a statement suggesting China was open to negotiations onFang, he added: ``To resolve this problem requires the efforts ofboth sides.''   On previous occasions, the Foreign Ministry always has statedthat Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, are counterrevolutionarycriminals wanted by Chinese police and demanded that the U.S. sidehand them over immediately.   Jin also soft-pedaled other issues, such as sanctions againstthe licensing of three American-made communications satellites thatChina hopes to launch for Australian and Hong Kong concerns.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that nodecision has been reached on a possible waiver on the export banfor the satellites.   Jin commented that the issuance of export licenses would``facilitate smooth cooperation'' between the two sides and ``theChinese side would welcome it.''   The Foreign Ministry spokesman also stressed several times thatalthough differences remain, ``under the current circumstances,where the international situation is undergoing the most profoundchanges since the end of World War II, the constant exchange ofcontacts between China and the United States is both necessary andbeneficial.''   He said both sides were ``gratified with the results'' of theScowcroft visit.   In one move possibly linked to the visit, the Foreign Ministryon Wednesday approved the accreditation for a Beijing residentcorrespondent from the U.S. government-financed Voice of America.   China expelled VOA Beijing correspondent Alan Pessin in Juneafter charging that VOA radio broadcasts, heard by millions ofChinese, were spreading rumors about the pro-democracydemonstrations and the government's bloody suppression of them.   The application for Pessin's replacement has been pending forfour months.   China continues to jam VOA's Mandarin and Cantonese broadcasts,as it has since June, but does not interfere with English-languagebroadcasts.</TEXT></DOC>
