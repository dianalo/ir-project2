The News, hit by a walkout last week by nine of its 10 unions,had said striking workers were welcome to return to their old jobsat any time as long as permanent replacements had not been hired.   A group of 40 reporters and photographers belonging to the750-member Newspaper Guild sent a delegation to discuss the matterSunday with Guild President Barry Lipton.   Some complained that the strike was called on the basis of afalse report that replacements had already been hired to fillreporting slots.   ``There's a lot of anger at the Guild leadership,'' saidstriking reporter JoAnne Wasserman.   But after the meeting, the group decided to stay on strike. TheGuild represents reporters, photographers and office workers. Itcould not be immediately determined how many Guild members arehonoring the strike.   No new talks are scheduled. The News has said it plans toreplace the strikers permanently.   The Daily News, the nation's second-largest metropolitan daily,has published a paper each day since the strike began Thursdaynight but conceded it is having trouble delivering the paper.   Home delivery was spotty and many newsstands were not gettingthe newspaper. ``We have not been hitting all distribution pointsas of yet,'' John T. Sloan, the newspaper's chief spokesman, saidSunday. ``We will soon.''   He also accused strikers of intimidating dealers and removingpapers from newsstands.   Strikers have torched delivery trucks and vandalized others.About 20 strikers have been arrested since the strike began, moston disorderly conduct charges.   Workers at the A andamp; S Stationery store in Brooklyn saidclub-wielding men had seized all 300 copies of Sunday's News andscattered them in the gutter. ``I can't take the paper or they willkill me,'' said one of the store's owners, Ali Najeli.   The New York Times quoted an unidentified management source assaying many drivers had become lost.   The News said in a statement Sunday that it published anddistributed more than 1.2 million papers in the city andsurrounding suburbs, exceeding Saturday's press run by 500,000. TheNews normally prints 1.46 million Sunday papers.   The 71-year-old daily has been in a financial tailspin for thepast decade. The News has lost about $115 million and seen dailycirculation slip by about 700,000 since 1980. It recently lost itsstanding as the nation's largest metropolitan daily to the LosAngeles Times.   The strike began Thursday night when 60 drivers at the News werereplaced in a dispute over whether a driver would be allowed tomonitor a conveyor belt while sitting down. All but one unionfollowed suit. Members of the Typographical Union have continuedworking because they have guaranteed lifetime jobs.   The unions claimed management provoked the crisis, whichfollowed 10 months of often stormy talks on contracts to replacethose that expired in March.</TEXT></DOC>
