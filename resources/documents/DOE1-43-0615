Information about proton-nucleus interactionsis included in the model as its component. Calculation of the differentialcross sections on energy and nuclei angle on the basis of this modelis done. Comparison of the results of the experiment and calculationis satisfactory. 17 refs.; 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
