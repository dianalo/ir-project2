About 1,500 soldiers, or two battalions of the 7th LightInfantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif., will join two battalionsfrom the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., and supportunits, the White House said Wednesday.   The first of 26 C-141 transport planes left Pope Air Force Basein Fayetteville, N.C., at 7:30 a.m. EST, carrying troops toPalmerola air base in Honduras. The planes would leave 30 minutesapart, said Lt. Gen. John W. Foss.   The first planeload of troops arrived at Palmerola at 11:15 a.m.EST, according to local radio stations transmitting from there.   ``The soldiers are well-trained and prepared for this mission,''said Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg.``They're excited but I would not say they are nervous. ''   Dozens of trucks carried troops and supplies from Ford Ord toTravis Air Force Base. The first C-141 from Travis lifted off at11:29 a.m., loaded with two busloads of troops and pallets ofsupplies. ``I expect it to go on all day,'' said Air Force Maj.Wayne Crist.   Several wives were told by their husbands that the battalionswould be flown to Florida, then to Honduras. Travis officials saidthey could not confirm that arrangement.   The White House on Wednesday ordered troops to Honduras in ``anemergency deployment readiness exercise'' triggered by what itcalled the invasion of Honduras by 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan forcespursuing Contra rebels.   Military intelligence sources in Honduras said late Wednesdaythat about 2,000 Sandinista troops were surrounded three milesinside Honduras. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said troops hadchased Contra rebels into Honduran territory, but would not saywhether the soldiers had crossed the border.   All 11,400 members of Fort Ord's Rapid Deployment Force wereengaged in a deployment readiness exercise when word came that twobattalions, between 1,100 and 1,200 soldiers, would go to Honduras,officials said.   At Fort Bragg, soldiers kissed their wives goodbye at marshalingpoints on the sprawling base.   ``It was really exciting,'' Pfc. Eugene Rice, 21, told TheCharlotte (N.C.) Observer. ``It was like, something's really goingto happen. We're finally going to get a chance to use ourtraining.''   Another soldier told the News and Observer of Raleigh, ``Theytold us to get our stuff together. They're rigging trucks thatthey've never rigged before. People don't know what to think. Theydon't know whether we're going to war or just doing a littlepeace-keeping. They're on ends right now.''   ``If we're going to do it, let's do it,'' Sgt. John Jones ofAtlanta said as he waited to board a plane.   Lt. Jim Cooper was in a class when he got his orders, so hedidn't get a chance to say good-bye to his wife. ``We are notallowed to do that,'' he said. ``But she understands.''   As he spoke, Cooper put camouflage paint on the face of Lt.Steve Swinley.   ``It's like a job,'' Swinley explained. ``We train to do ourjob.''   The men said morale was soaring.   ``It's the best I've ever seen,'' said Cooper. ``We're 100percent ready.''   The Rapid Deployment Force is trained to respond quickly toassignments around the world. The daylong exercise involvedrecalling troops to the base to check of weapons, vehicles andother equipment, spokesman Paul Boyce said.   There are 21,000 soldiers at Fort Ord, 80 miles south of SanFrancisco.   ``We're just hoping and praying nothing serious comes fromthis,'' said Karen Brylewski, a civilian base worker, who said herhusband told her that his unit was scheduled to fly to Florida fromTravis this morning.   Fort Bragg is home to the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne andthe Green Berets and has sent troops to trouble spots around theworld, including Grenada during the the October 1983 U.S. invasionand to Sinai for peacekeeping.   Eight hundred paratroopers will be dropped about five miles fromthe Honduran base, said Maj. Gen. Carl Stiner, commander of the82nd Airborne. They will land in ``an area that's been cleared fordrops. Once they land, they will move to Palmerola air force base.They then will establish liaison with the Honduran military andbegin conducting combined training exercises.''   Lt. Col David Kiernan, a base spokesman, said the troops werejoining Joint Task Force Bravo, which includes about 1,200 soldiersfrom Fort Bragg and other units already in Honduras.   Kiernan called the action an ``off-post training exercise'' andsaid that troops would not take part in hostilities.   The Army also loaded a C-5 transport plane with equipment,including three light observation helicopters, four Cobra gunshiphelicopters, one Blackhawk UH-60 helicopter, a command vehicle andammunition, Stiner said.   He said a battalion rigged for combat would remain at Pope onalert status.   In Durham, N.C., about 50 people attended a candlelight vigilWednesday night to protest the deployment of troops, said MandyCarter, director of the War Resisters League, which sponsored thevigil with Witness for Peace.</TEXT></DOC>
