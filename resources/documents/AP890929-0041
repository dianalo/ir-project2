(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Caught between the burgeoning cost ofstate-mandated social programs and the legacy of the Proposition 13tax revolt, some officials in rural Butte County think bankruptcymay be their only answer.   Budget cuts have forced the county to release inmates fromovercrowded jails, curtail office hours and cut the sheriff'sdepartment in half despite a four-fold increase in the county'spopulation.   Understaffed libraries may have to close soon, but officialshave made room in the budget for one new expense _ hiring a team ofbankruptcy lawyers.   ``We've cut and bled every year and literally dismantled ourgovernment until we got to this point,'' says Supervisor KarenVercruse.   ``At some point, the whole thing starts to melt down,'' countyadministrator Will Randolph said. ``We're there. We're down to thatpoint.''   Many of the state's other 57 counties read their future in theproblems of Butte County, an area 150 miles northeast of Sacramentorich in gold mining lore, forests and fertile farmland but alsohome to widespread poverty.   ``The danger is that Butte County is the precursor of all theother counties,'' said Dan Wall, lobbyist for the CountySupervisors Association of California. ``We think it's a realdanger, a real possibility.''   Counties complain that the state continually shorts them onfunding to pay for welfare, health, court and other services theyare required to provide, while inflation erodes property tax ratesthat were frozen by the Proposition 13 taxpayer revolt of 1978.   Facing a $3 million deficit on its $128 million budget, ButteCounty got short-term relief Sept. 18 when Gov. George Deukmejianagreed to defer a $2.8 million billing for fire services.   In exchange for the deferment, the county consented to a stateaudit.   But without a long-term solution _ reforms in the funding ofCalifornia's counties, a state takeover of some county duties, orboth _ Butte County officials say they'll have to pay back thestate and only be worse off.   Deukmejian has attacked local governments for blaming theirbudget cuts on the state. Some officials predict the results of theaudit will force the state to acknowledge that counties have beenchronically underfunded.   ``It can't be written off to something such as mismanagement orsomebody's not doing their job,'' says Pat Chartrand, consultant tostate Sen. Jim Nielsen, who represents Butte County.   The counties face ``more and more obligations and not renoughrevenue,'' Chartrand said.   County officials were considering bankruptcy before the firebill deferment; their decision on whether to declare bankruptcy inthe future may hinge on any action the state takes in response tothe audit, as well as to possible action by the legislature when itreturns from recess in January, officials said.   Oroville, at the foot of the Sierra Nevada in the northernSacramento Valley, was settled by miners in the 1849 Gold Rush andis named after the Spanish word for gold.   But it is the lure of cheaper housing that is drawing a new waveof low-income immigrants from cities to Butte County and otherunincorporated areas, swelling welfare rolls and the demand forother services.   Butte County, whose 23 percent property tax rate is the state'ssecond lowest after Orange County, has been particularly hurt byProposition 13.   Since the initiative's passage, Randolph said, the county'srevenues have grown just 26 percent, while inflation has risen 48percent and costs of mandated programs jumped 261 percent.   Meanwhile, the county's population of 40,000 has grown to170,000 and county costs for general assistance welfare grantsincreased from $100,000 a year in 1981-82 to $2.4 million thisyear, he said.   The sheriff's department staff has been reduced from 50 patrolofficers to 24. With round-the-clock shifts, there are nights wherethere are only two deputies to patrol the entire county, roughly2,000 square miles, Randolph said.   Jailers must release inmates weekly to meet a court ordergoverning the population of the county's overcrowded jail; fivelibrary branches will close Sept. 30 unless volunteers agree to runthem, Randolph said.   Len Fulton, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, said hereached the conclusion in 1985 that his county was dying.   ``I've often said, if we were a corporation here, we probablywould have filed for Chapter 11 moments after I got on this board,which was 7{ years ago.''</TEXT></DOC>
