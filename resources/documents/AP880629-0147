We're not investigating the firms themselves.''   Newkirk said he did not know the number of firm recordssubpoenaed. But SEC officials familiar with the investigation, whospoke on condition of anonymity, said that besides Morgan Stanley andamp;Co., subpoenas were sent to Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., First Boston Co.,Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Charles Schwabandamp; Co.   The SEC has accused Morgan Stanley securities analyst StephenWang Jr., 24, of leaking inside information about at least 25corporate takeovers in which Morgan Stanley played a role to FredC. Lee. Lee, 38, a wealthy Hong Kong-based investor who hadnumerous trading accounts on Wall Street, also has a home in theWashington suburb of McLean, Va.   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told a Senate subcommittee todaythat his agency has asked Swiss authorities to provide informationon trades emanating from that country that the SEC believesinvolved Lee.   Ruder, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee'ssecurities subcommittee, said the SEC also is involved in ``activenegotiations to possibly freeze assets in Switzerland'' controlledby Lee.   Ruder would not discuss how much money the trades involved orthe value of the assets.   At the same hearing, SEC enforcement chief Gary Lynch said theagency has 40 to 50 investigations under way involving foreigntrading, including one that ``involves very large dollar amounts.''   The commission claims Lee made at least $19 million by tradingon that information and shared $200,000 with Wang. It has demandedthe two repay the money plus triple damages for a total of $76million, the second-biggest insider tradin case after the $100million Ivan F. Boesky scandal.   In a complaint filed Monday in Manhattan federal court, the SECalso obtained an order freezing the assets of both men.   Wang's attorney, Ira L. Sorkin, has declined to comment on theaccusations other than to say he's studying them. Lee's attorneyMichael Perlis was quoted in today's New York Times as saying hisclient intends to resist the accusations.   ``They want to make him out to be another Ivan Boesky, but he'sfar from that,'' Perlis told the newspaper.   Perlis also said, ``We told the SEC that we would be willing tosign a consent decree on reasonable terms.'' Under a consentdecree, a defendant generally may settle charges, sometimes payinga penalty, without admitting or denying guilt.   The Wang-Lee case has raised major questions about Wall Street'sself-policing efforts in the aftermath of the insider-tradinguproar created by Boesky, formerly one of the securities industry'sbest-known speculators.   Boesky settled insider trading charges in November 1986 byreturning $50 million in illicit profits and paying $50 million inpenalties. In addition, he was banished from securities trading forlife and was sentenced to a three-year prison term for conspiringto lie to the SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
