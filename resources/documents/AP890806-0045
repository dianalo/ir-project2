Gorbachev shook a well-oiledmachine's stranglehold on political power.   Officials who dominated Soviet life for more than a half-centurytook an unprecedented bashing, beginning with March elections,through July coal miners' strikes and the final days of thelegislative session that ended Friday.   The party undoubtedly still is the strongest force in societyand Gorbachev's authority is not questioned. But those whotraditionally have wielded power were left dazed and unsure.   Dozens were humiliated in their first competitive elections.Some were exposed to the fury of miners who cannot buy enough soap.A half-dozen others were rejected by the Supreme Soviet for Cabinetjobs.   New deputies criticized Gorbachev, rewrote tax and labor laws,and even suggested Vladimir I. Lenin be removed from his mausoleumon Red Square.   Deputies ``literally burst onto the podium with their platforms,program, proposals, accusations,'' Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov tolda recent party meeting. ``But the Politburo ended up over on theside, in some kind of isolated state, as if some paralysis syndromewere at work.''   ``A real and mighty power has appeared _ the Congress ofPeople's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet _ and we cannot refuse tocome to grips with it,'' he said. ``If the party does not find away out of this situation, it may lose its influence in running thegovernment.''   It was small consolation that 85 percent of deputies are partymembers. Like never before, they are unconstrained by a strictparty line.   Former candidate Politburo member Boris N. Yeltsin turned hisrocky relationship with the party into a populist campaign againstincompetence and special privilege. A week ago, several hundreddeputies helped him form the first organized parliamentaryopposition in 70 years.   Regional officials plead for direction from Gorbachev.   ``It's time to clearly determine where is the limit of party andgovernment discipline, and where is pluralism of opinion,'' saidAbsamat Masaliev, party chief in the Central Asian republic ofKirghizia.   Moscow party leader Lev N. Zaikov said lack of direction hasupset many local party organizations that have reacted by doingnothing.   Since the time of Lenin, a clear purpose and strong organizationhave meant power for the Communist Party.   Today many officials are confused and hesitant.   ``How has this come about?'' Gorbachev mused. ``A partyorganization consisting of thousands, with its own newspapers, itsown professional staff, with everything at its disposal, finds theinitiative slipping out of its grasp?''   Instead of providing a detailed party line, he has provedwilling even to side with critics.   It was Gorbachev who masterminded the electoral system thatembarrassed dozens of key party officials.   The strike by hundreds of thousands of miners reiterated thatcommon people are taking to heart Gorbachev's call to action. Thisspasm of unrest for the first time was based on something allSoviets have in common _ the poor state of the economy.   Gorbachev sympathized with the strikers and promised changes.   Their activity gave Gorbachev a large but intangible victory inhis drive to turn more power back to the people, leading to thequestion at the heart of his reforms: what will the people do withpower if and when they get it?   At least one political scientist, Andronik Migranyan, wondershow long people will allow Gorbachev to lead them against the partyapparatus he heads.   Gorbachev ``practically found himself two roles: both Luther andthe Pope,'' Migranyan wrote recently. ``He wants to destroy theexisting structures, and at the same time personifies thosestructures for the public. And certainly, lack of successes whichare due to the clumsy function of the party and state structureweaken his role as leader.''   Even Politburo members warn that if the party does not improveits standing, the Soviet Union may spin out of control.   An end to the Communists' hold on absolute power would be``simply deadly,'' said Yegor K. Ligachev. ``A multiparty systemwould mean the breakup of the Soviet federation ... because theCommunist Party is the only real political force that binds andunites all people of the country into a single union of republics.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Mark Porubcansky has been a correspondent forThe Associated Press in Moscow since February 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
