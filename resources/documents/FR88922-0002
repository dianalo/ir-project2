This actiondoes not constitute a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectivenessof these regulations under those procedures. The sunset review date establishedfor these regulations is established as April 1, 1992.John Marshall, Manager, FCIC, (1) has determined that this action is nota major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291 because it will not resultin: (a) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) majorincreases in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,State, or local governments, or a geographical region; or (c) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets; and (2) certifies that thisaction will not increase the federal paperwork burden for individuals,small businesses, and other persons.This action is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct; therefore, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.450.This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR29115, June 24, 1983.This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an EnvironmentalAssessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.On Wednesday, June 8, 1988, FCIC published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 21455, to amend the Wheat Endorsement(7 CFR 401.101) to clarify the quality adjustment of wheat in relationto the U.S. Grain Standards (7 CFR 810.2201 et seq.). The public was given30 days in which to submit written comments, data, and opinions on theproposed rule.One comment was received from the Crop Hail Insurance Actuarial Association(CHIAA) correctly affirming that the stated purpose of the proposed rulewas to make test weight by class a criteria for quality adjustment, thuscorrecting an omission in the Wheat Endorsement. The current Wheat Endorsementprovides in this section that a test weight of 53 pounds will be used asa criteria in determining the adjustment, without reference to class ofwheat.In its comment, CHIAA stated that the rule proposed determines that matureproduction will be eligible for quality adjustment which grades U.S. No.5 or Sample Grade and that the current endorsement has standards equalto U.S. No. 4 grade (53 pounds). CHIAA felt that the proposed rule wouldincrease the minimum test weight from 50 to 53 pounds; and correspondinglyincrease the maximum total damaged kernels from 10 to 15 percent; and,the shrunken or broken kernels from 12 to 20 percent.A careful reading of the present endorsement, however, determines thatno change will be made for some classes of wheat and a change of only onepound in test weight will be made for other classes. Under either endorsement,the quality adjustment occurred when wheat graded U.S. No. 5 for certainfactors.Upon review of these regulations, FCIC determined that the test weightused for quality adjustment was not in accordance with the U.S. Grain Standardsas was intended. The section currently provides that, a test weight of53 pounds per bushel will be used as a criteria to determine the adjustmentwithout reference to wheat class. To conform to the U.S. Grain Standards,the test weight by class of wheat insured should be used.For this reason, FCIC does not accept CHIAA's recommendation that thisproposal be revised to remain consistent with the current program, sincethere appears to be no difference in the meaning or intent of this sectionin the proposed rule and CHIAA's 1988_CHIAA 714 Small Grain Provisionson wheat test requirements for quality adjustment.Discussions held with representatives of the Federal Grain Inspection Serviceresulted in suggested language which, while changing the wording as appearingin the proposed rule at 53 FR 21455, does not change the meaning of thissection or the intent of the proposed rule.FCIC hereby amends the Claim for Indemnity section of the Wheat endorsementto incorporate, by reference, the U.S. Grain Standards as to those factorswhich are relevant to the insured's claim.This final rule is designed to become effective beginning with all wheatplanted in the spring of 1989. It is the intention of FCIC to file thisrule as a final rule by the next appropriate filing date of December 31,1988, for those countries with an April 15 cancellation date, as providedin Section 9 of the Wheat Endorsement.However, this action will have the effect of not providing appropriateprovisions for test weight by class for those insured who produce fallplanted 1989 wheat of certain classes (1989 wheat planted in the fall of1988), because the filing date of December 31 is past the time when suchwheat is planted.For this reason, and in order to provide an equitable determination forinsureds producing <T3>both</T3> spring and fall planted wheat, FICA will administrativelyconsider claims for indemnity submitted by fall planted wheat insuredson the same basis as outlined in this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 401</ITAG>General crop insurance regulations, Wheat endorsement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop InsuranceAct, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 <T3>et seq.)</T3>, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation amends the GeneralCrop Insurance Regulations in 7 CFR Part 401, by amending the Wheat Endorsement(7 CFR 401.101), to be effective for the 1989 and succeeding crop years,as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 401_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
