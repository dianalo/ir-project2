Meanwhile, in what he called a test of Iran's commitment, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz proposed &quot;formal and direct&quot; talks &quot;as soon as possible&quot; between the two warring nations -- first at the U.N. and later in Tehran and Baghdad -- on measures to enforce the cease-fire resolution.    And in an interview in Washington yesterday, Iraq's ambassador to the U.S. predicted that peace between Iran and Iraq would lead to &quot;stability in {oil} pricing and fair sharing of oil markets&quot; by both countries, which are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced in New York that he was immediately dispatching teams to Iran and Iraq to begin discussing details of the cease-fire in the nearly eight-year-old war. The U.N. official said he hoped the teams would complete their initial work within a week, after which he could announce enactment of the agreement. Iraq agreed to the cease-fire a year ago when it was passed by the U.N.    While welcoming this week's sudden progress toward a cease-fire, senior Reagan administration officials maintained a dose of skepticism. These officials said it is too soon to know whether Iran wants to end the war or merely is searching for a breather so it can rearm and continue the struggle. But one senior official said, &quot;If Khomeini has now said these things, I would take that quite seriously.&quot;    The senior U.S. official also said Iran's religious leader most likely made his statement to assure domestic opponents of the cease-fire that he supports it and to explain Iran's stunning turnabout on the issue to the Iranian public.    The ayatollah repeatedly had vowed that Iran's price for ending the war was toppling the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. According to Reuter news service, the ayatollah said yesterday: &quot;Taking this decision was more deadly than taking poison.&quot; But he indicated the decision was necessary because the cost of the war, a string of Iranian defeats and growing domestic opposition were jeopardizing Iran's Islamic revolution.    In an apparent reaction to doubts that Iran was serious about the cease-fire, the ayatollah said: &quot;Our aim is not a new tactic to continue the war.&quot;    In the past, according to U.S. analysts, the ayatollah has shown a willingness to abandon deeply held positions to protect the revolution. These analysts also say the Iranian leader, who is believed to be 87 years old, may have concluded that he must end the war to ensure that Iran remains on the correct revolutionary course after he passes from the scene.    In the interview yesterday, Ambassador Abdul-Amir Ali Al-Anbari of Iraq said the war has made it &quot;difficult for OPEC to negotiate sensible pricing&quot; because of Iran's suspicions that Saudi Arabia, the group's largest producer and an ally of Iraq, was conspiring against Tehran. The envoy said that cooperation between Iran and Iraq would help stabilize oil prices, but wouldn't necessarily increase them. But some analysts say the end of the war might further soften pricing as the two cash-starved nations increase production.    The ambassador also said that if the war ends, &quot;a new horizon will open up in U.S.-Iraqi cooperation in all spheres.&quot; He said the war has &quot;constrained&quot; U.S.-Iraqi relations because of U.S. efforts to remain neutral. Most analysts agree that in recent years, Washington has tilted toward Iraq. Lately, however, a coolness developed in the relationship as a succession of military victories made Baghdad less willing to settle for peace.    During the years of the shah, Iran was America's principal ally in the Persian Gulf. Now, after eight years of bitter relations with the ayatollah's revolutionary government and the embarrassment of the Iran-Contra scandal, the administration is waiting for Tehran to designate an authorized official to open a dialogue with Washington, a senior official said, adding that Tehran hasn't yet taken that step.    If a lasting peace is found, it would enable the U.S. to end its large naval presence in the Persian Gulf, where warships have sought to protect oil tankers and other commercial vessels from attack. </TEXT></DOC>
