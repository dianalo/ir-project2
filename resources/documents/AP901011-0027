But the 518-member assembly only half-heartedly endorsed thedocument on Wednesday, partly because of a recommendation to giveimmigrants the right to vote in local elections after five years ofresidency.   After some intense political wrangling, the parliament agreed tosimply pass the report - which took a year to be completed by aspecial committee of inquiry - on to the 12 European Communitygovernments without comment.   The vote was 181-to-146 with 18 abstentions.   The 176-page report offered a detailed summary of racistincidents and the activities of right-wing political groups inEurope in recent years.   It said racism is worsening in Europe largely because of risingimmigration. But it also cites political changes in Eastern Europethat have allowed many long-festering ethnic disputes to break outinto the open.   Among those voting against the report were the parliament's 17extreme right-wingers, who argued that it overstated racism.Liberals and Christian Democrats also voted against.   The report was written by a special panel of inquiry. Itfollowed a similar study in the mid-1980s which was found last yearto have shortcomings for ignoring the effect of the EC's singlemarket project on race relations.   Among other things, the new report says:   - One in three citizens of EC countries believe there are toomany people of other nationalities in their countries.   - In the United Kingdom, a country plagued by an especially``high level of racial harassment and violence,'' as many as 70,000racial attacks occur annually. In recent years Britain's neo-nazi``skinhead'' movement has spread to other European nations,especially Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.   - Right-wing political parties with pronounced racist views havewon seats in national parliaments in France, Germany, theNetherlands and Belgium.   - Almost 70 percent of Germans believe immigrants unfairlyexploit their social welfare system.   - France has been gripped recently by a growing number ofracially motivated killings, bombings and vandalism.   - In Greece, Moslems are often harassed and denied buildingpermits and drivers' licences.   In all, the report made 77 recommendations aimed at improvingconditions for the estimated 12 to 14 million immigrants in theEuropean Community and to encourage racial tolerance.   ``Our aim should be that there be no second-class citizenswithin the EC after the creation of the single market of 1992,''said Glyn Ford, a British Socialist and the author of the report.   Among the most far-reaching recommendations was one urging theEC executive Commission to draft a `` European Residents' Charter''that would allow non-EC nationals, legally resident in one ECnation, the same freedom of movement within the 12-nation bloc asEC citizens.   The report also urged the European Commission to send more moneyto poorer areas with high immigrant populations and to adopt acommon policy on refugee and visa issues.   The European Community comprises Britain, France, TheNetherlands, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Luxembourg,Denmark, Ireland and Greece.</TEXT></DOC>
