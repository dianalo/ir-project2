The international human rights organization said an unspecifiednumber of other civilians were seriously injured in the sameincident, in which soldiers dumped the victims' bodies in a well inthe northwest section of the town.   It said most of the victims were refugees of the Dinka and Luoethnic groups who had been living in Wau.   They were arrested shortly before being killed, AmnestyInternational said.   The group added it had collected the names of the dead and alsoof 13 of the injured.   The Sudan government has not commented on the alleged massacre,but the civilian government, before its ouster in a coup June 30,denied similar allegations against the army.   ``Amnesty International is particularly concerned because thesekillings do not appear to be isolated cases,'' a statement said.``Its information reveals a persistent pattern of serious humanrights violations in the context of the civil war in the south.''   It said many civilians and captured members of the rebel SudanPeople's Liberation Army had been killed by the army andgovernment-allied troops.   Amnesty International urged the Sudanese government toinvestigate the alleged massacre. It also issued appeals on behalfof former Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, ousted in the coup, andhis wife, Sara al-Fadil Mahmoud.   It said el-Mahdi was abused and threatened for refusing to backthe new military government, and subjected to a mock execution.   The government last week denied a report that el-Mahdi was beingtortured. A statement said his family has regular visits and thatanybody else could visit him for evidence he had not been tortured.The statement did not mention his wife.</TEXT></DOC>
