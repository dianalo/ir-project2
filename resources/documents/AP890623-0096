Israeli army officials denied their troops were involved and saidtheir militia allies, the South Lebanon Army, carried out the``initiative actions.''   Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main Shiite Moslem ally inLebanon, said in a statement its guerrillas suffered ``a number ofcasualties, killed and wounded'' in the three-hour attack that beganat 11 a.m.   Police said about 300 Israeli troops and militiamen of the SouthLebanon Army in 35 armored personnel carriers moved up for theassault behind an artillery barrage, with backing from three Israelihelicopter gunships.   The attackers fought their way into the villages of Kawkaba,Dellafeh, Kfar Houna and Mydoun, three to four miles north of thesecurity zone in the Syrian-controlled western Bekaa valley, policereported.   They blew up several houses in a search for Hezbollah guerrillas,said a police spokesman who cannot be named under standingregulations. He said it was not known if any guerrillas werearrested.   Israeli officials said the force made sweeps for guerrillas andweapons south of Mydoun and returned safely early in the afternoon.   The attack occurred two miles south of the Syrian army's frontlines in the Bekaa valley. The Syrians took no part in thehostilities, the police spokesman said.   Israel carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk ofits invading army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985 after athree-year occupation.   The 6-to-10-mile deep enclave, a buffer against guerrilla attackson northern Israeli settlements, is patrolled by the Israeli armyand the SLA.</TEXT></DOC>
