Objectives were to: update andverify energy consumption and productions data for the various processsteps as of 1985; determine the potential energy savings attainable byreplacing current practices with state-of-the-art and with advanced (2010)production practices and technologies; and identify areas of researchand development opportunity that will enable these potential future savingsto be achieved. Results concluded that for a projected year 2010 productionlevel, there is a potential to save between 31 and 55% of the projectedenergy use by replacing current technology practices with state-of-the-artand advanced technologies. Randamp;D needs and opportunities were identifiedfor the industry. Potential Randamp;D candidates for DOE involvement were selectedfrom the identified list based primarily on their energy savings potentialand the opinion of industry experts.</TEXT></DOC>
