The prime rate rose three-quarters of a percentage pointto 8.25% effective today, following an increase in the Bankof Canada's bank rate to 7.71% from 7.50%. The bank rate isthe rate the central bank charges on loans to financialinstitutions.</LP><TEXT>   Financial analysts said the rise in the bank rate wasaimed at supporting the Canadian dollar, which has come underrenewed selling pressure in recent days.   Douglas Peters, Toronto-Dominion Bank's chief economist,said an increase in Canadian short-term interest rates willhave a &quot;destructive&quot; impact on the Canadian economy. He saidit will send the wrong message to consumers and jeopardizeCanada's economic recovery.   Canada's gross domestic product shrank 0.2% in the 1991fourth quarter, partly because of a drop in consumerspending.   The increase in the prime rate, a benchmark for variouslending charges, deals an additional blow to Canadianmanufacturers, which already are &quot;in pretty dire straits,&quot;said Stephen Van Houten, president of the CanadianManufacturers' Association.   Canadian Finance Minister Don Mazankowski said theincrease is a &quot;short-term development&quot; caused by &quot;volatility&quot;in financial markets. &quot;We think the fundamentals are in placeto sustain low interest rates over the long haul,&quot; Mr.Mazankowski said.   Before yesterday's adjustment, the prime rate had declinedsteadily since it peaked at 14.75% in August 1990. It hadreached its lowest level in 19 years.   But in recent weeks short-term interest rates had startedto rise again because of a drop in the Canadian dollar. Inlate trading in Toronto, the Canadian dollar was quoted at84.28 U.S. cents, up from 84.02 U.S. cents late Wednesday butdown about five U.S. cents from early November.   Financial analysts have attributed the currency's declineto an easing in Canadian monetary conditions and a narrowerspread between Canadian and U.S. short-term rates. Renewedconcerns about Canada's constitutional problems also havecontributed to the Canadian dollar's fall, analysts said.Earlier this week the currency briefly hit a two-year low.   The Bank of Canada is concerned that a further decline inthe Canadian dollar will jeopardize its chances of achievingits inflation reduction goals, Mr. Peters, theToronto-Dominion Bank economist said. This year's goal is tolimit the year-on-year rise in the consumer price index to 3%by year-end.   The Canadian prime rate currently is 1.75 percentagepoints above the U.S. prime rate.</TEXT></DOC>
