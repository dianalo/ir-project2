Theestimated weighted-average dumping margins are shown in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice. We also determine that criticalcircumstances exist with respect to imports of certain classes or kindsof AFBs from the FRG, as outlined in the ``Critical Circumstances'' sectionof this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our notice of preliminary determinations (53 FR 45353, November 9,1988), the following events have occurred. All respondents and petitionerrequested that the final determinations in all of the antidumping dutyinvestigations be postponed until not later than 135 days after the dateof publication of the preliminary determinations, pursuant to section 735(a)(2)of the Act. On December 2, 1988, we issued a notice postponing our finaldeterminations until not later than March 24, 1989 (53 FR 49581, December8, 1988). That notice also announced the scheduling of the public hearingin these investigations. Verification of the questionnaire responses was conducted in the FRG andthe United States during November and December 1988 and January 1989. A public hearing was held on February 22, 1989. Petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties have filed pre- and post-hearing briefs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by these investigations. These determinations cover ball bearings, mounted or unmounted, and partsthereof (ball bearings); spherical roller bearings, mounted or unmounted,and parts thereof (spherical roller bearings); cylindrical roller bearings,mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (cylindrical roller bearings);needle roller bearings, mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (needleroller bearings); and spherical plain bearings, mounted or unmounted, andparts thereof (including rod end bearings) (spherical plain bearings).For a complete description of these products, see Appendix A to this notice(hereinafter referred to as Appendix A). <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>Subsequent to the initiation of these investigations, the Department determinedthat the products under investigation constituted five separate classesor kinds of merchandise. After consideration of all comments, arguments,and information submitted by the parties, we find no reason to alter thatdecision. For a full discussion of our position on class or kind of merchandise,see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>We determine that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise described in Appendix A to this notice.For a full discussion of standing, see Appendix B which is referred tobelow. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues </ITAG>Appendix B to this notice (hereinafter referred to as Appendix B) containsdetailed discussions of all issues timely raised by parties to the proceedingin each of the concurrent antidumping duty investigations involving AFBsfrom nine countries. The first part of that Appendix addresses all generalissues raised during these investigations and our treatment of these topics.The general issues discussed therein are listed below. 1. Class or Kind of Merchandise 2. Standing 3. Products Covered 4. Basis for Cost of Production Investigations 5. Market Viability 6. Alternative Reporting Requirements 7. Critical Circumstances 8. Administrative Protective Order Issues Following the discussion of general issues, all remaining comments areaddressed, in alphabetical order by subject and company. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation (POI) is October 1, 1987 through March 31,1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from the FRG to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. For reasons discussed in the best information available section of AppendixB, we have determined, in accordance with  Section 776(c) of the Act, thatthe use of best information available is appropriate for SKF and INA forcertain classes or kinds of merchandise. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>For each of the respondents in these investigations, all sales to the firstunrelated purchaser used in our analysis took place after importation intothe United States. Therefore, we based United States price on exporter'ssales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>FAG Kugelfischer George Schafer KGgA (FAG):</T3> FAG reported thatmore than 33 percent by volume of its U.S. sales were identical to productssold in the home market. Certain of those sales included products whichwere further manufactured in the United States. We have determined thatit is appropriate to exclude all such sales from our analysis. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)We have used all remaining U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on packed, c.i.f., and delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where  appropriate,for containerization, foreign inland and ocean freight, import brokerage,import duties, marine and foreign inland insurance, U.S. inland freight,and U.S. inland insurance, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of theAct. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates.We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for commissions,credit, repacking in the United States, third party payments, warrantyexpenses, and indirect selling expenses (including advertising, indirectselling expenses incurred in the FRG and the United States, inventory carryingcosts, product liability premiums, and technical service expenses), pursuantto section 772(e)(1) and (2) of the Act. We added the amount of value addedtaxes which would have been collected if the merchandise had not been exported.FAG reported purchase price sales of ball bearings in its original response.However, we verified that these constitute a minimal percentage of FAG'ssales to the United States. Therefore, we did not include these sales inour calculation of U.S. price. We have excluded from our calculation of United States price sales of AFBsby FAG to the U.S. government for military and defense procurement. (<T3>See,</T3> Military Procurement section of Appendix B.) We also excluded from our calculation of United States price, replacementAFBs for defective products, and AFBs used as promotional samples (bothprovided free-of-charge to FAG's customers) because these transactionsinvolved an insignificant number of units. However, we have included salesof allegedly obsolete or discontinued AFBs in our calculations. (<T3>See,</T3> Miscellaneous section of Appendix B.)B. <T3>Georg Muller Nurnberg (GMN):</T3> GMN reported that more than 33 percentby volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sold in the homemarket. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)In our preliminary determination, we limited our fair value analysis tothose products with matching control numbers since we were not satisfiedthat matched products with different control numbers were in fact identical.At verification, we confirmed that these products were not identical. Therefore,for the purposes of our final determination, we have excluded matched productswith different control numbers and only included U.S. sales with identicalhome market control numbers in our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on packed, f.o.b., and delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for brokerage and handling, foreign inland freight, marine insurance, oceanfreight, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight, in accordance with section772(d)(2) of the Act. We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for commissions, credit, and indirect selling expenses (including indirectselling expenses incurred in the home market, inventory carrying costs,product liability premiums) pursuant to sections 772(e) (1) and (2) ofthe Act. We added the amount of the value added taxes which would havebeen collected if the merchandise had not been exported. C. <T3>INA Walzlager Schaeffler (INA):</T3> INA reported that more than 33percent by volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products in the homemarket. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for brokerage and handling (which included containerization, marine insurance,ocean freight, U.S. inland freight and insurance), foreign inland freight,foreign inland insurance, and U.S. duty, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)of the Act. We also made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for creditexpenses, repacking, and indirect selling expenses (including non-U.S.indirect selling expenses and U.S. indirect selling expenses, inventorycarrying costs, product liability premiums, and warranty expenses), pursuantto sections 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act. We added the amount of valueadded taxes which would have been collected if the merchandise had notbeen exported. We modified the following claims based on verified information: warrantyexpenses, credit expenses, inventory carrying costs, product liabilityexpenses, U.S. indirect selling expenses and non-U.S. indirect sellingexpenses. (<T3>See,</T3> Selling Expenses section of Appendix B.) D.<T3> SKF Kugellagerfabriken GmbH (SKF): See, </T3>Best Information Availablesection of Appendix B. II. Spherical Roller Bearings <T3>FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Certain of thosesales included products which were further manufactured in the United States.We determined that it is appropriate to exclude all such sales from ouranalysis. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)We have used all remaining U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP for spherical roller bearings based on packed, c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. FAG reported purchase price sales of spherical roller bearings in its originalresponse. However, we verified that these constitute a minimal percentageof FAG's sales to the United States. Therefore, we did not include thesesales in our calculation of U.S. price. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A.<T3> FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Certainof those sales included products which were further manufactured in theUnited States. We determined that it is appropriate to exclude all suchsales from our analysis. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)We have used all remaining U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP for cylindrical roller bearings based on packed, c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings.FAG reported purchase price sales of cylindrical roller bearings in itsoriginal response. However, we verified that these constitute a minimalpercentage of FAG's sales to the United States. Therefore, we did not includethese sales in our calculation of United States price. B. <T3>INA: See,</T3> Best Information Available section of Appendix B. C. <T3>SKF: See,</T3> Best Information Available section of Appendix B. IV. Needle Roller Bearings A. <T3>FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)We have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP for needle roller bearings based on packed, c.i.f., anddelivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. B. <T3>INA:</T3> INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP for needle roller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. U.S.warehouse prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. C. <T3>SKF: See,</T3> Best Information Available section to Appendix B. V. Spherical Plain Bearings A. <T3>FAG:</T3> FAG reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP for spherical plain bearings based on packed, c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. B. <T3>SKF: See,</T3> Best Information Available section to Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales and constructed value (CV). The calculationof foreign market value for each class or kind of merchandise for eachrespondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>FAG:</T3> Petitioner alleged that FAG's home market sales of ball bearingswere made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Based on petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on FAG's production costs. Wecalculated the COP on the basis of FAG's cost of materials, labor, otherfabrication costs, and general and administrative expenses. The COP datasubmitted by FAG was relied upon, except in the following instances wherethe costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. These were: (1) Cost of manufacturing was corrected for a clerical error; (2) A consulting fee which had been amortized over a fifteen-year periodwas included in 1987 Gandamp;A costs, as this is the year it was incurred;(3) A clerical error in general expenses was corrected; and (4) Interest expense was adjusted to reflect the net financial expenserelated to operations of the consolidated FAG Group.We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. CV was calculated on thebasis of FAG's fabrication costs plus general expenses and profit. Actualgeneral expenses were used since these exceeded the statutory minimum requirementof ten percent of materials and fabrication. The statutory eight percentminimum profit was applied. Imputed credit and inventory carrying costswere included in selling expenses; therefore, interest expense reflectedon the company books was reduced for a portion of the expense related tothese activities in order to avoid double counting. All the changes madeto the COP were also made to those cost elements in CV. We added U.S. packing.We deducted all direct selling expenses, and indirect selling expenses,up to the ESP cap. Where we found that sufficient sales were above cost to permit the useof these sales as the basis for determining foreign market value, we calculatedforeign market value based on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customersin the home market. We made deductions from the home market price, whereappropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance, home market packing,corrections for pricing and invoice errors, and discounts and rebates.We made an addition for freight revenue. We added U.S. packing to the homemarket price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions included in our analysis involved ESP, we madefurther deductions from home market price, where appropriate, for commissions,credit, and warranty expenses. We also deducted certain indirect sellingexpenses which include: product liability premiums, inventory carryingcosts, advertising, and technical service expenses, in accordance with19 CFR 353.15(c). We also made an adjustment to foreign market value for revenue earned onhedging operations to account for differences between FAG's actual exchangerate return and the Federal Reserve rate employed by the Department. (<T3>See, </T3>Miscellaneous section of Appendix B.) We made an upward adjustment to the tax-exclusive home market prices forthe value-added tax we computed for the United States price. B. <T3>GMN: </T3>Petitioner alleged that GMN's home market sales of ball bearingswere made at prices below the COP. Based on petitioner's allegation, wegathered and verified data on GMN's production costs. We calculated theCOP on the basis of GMN's cost of materials, labor, other fabrication costsand general and administrative expenses. The COP data submitted by GMNwas relied upon, except in the following instances where the costs werenot appropriately quantified or valued. These were: (1) Indirect selling expenses were deducted from Gandamp;A expenses to eliminatedouble counting since they were also included as part of the selling expenses,(2) Interest expense net of interest income related to operations was includedin the COP, and (3) Packing expense was removed from the Gandamp;A calculation and reportedseparately. We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. CV was calculated on thebasis of GMN's fabrication costs plus general expenses and profit. Actualgeneral expenses were used since these exceeded the statutory minimum requirementof ten percent of materials and fabrication. The statutory eight percentminimum profit was applied. Imputed credit and inventory carrying costswere included in selling expenses; therefore, interest expense reflectedon the company books was reduced for a portion of the expense related tothese activities in order to avoid double counting. All the changes madeto the COP were also made to those cost elements in CV. We added U.S. packing.We deducted all direct selling expenses, and indirect selling expenses,up to the ESP cap. Where we found that sufficient sales were above cost to permit the useof these sales as the basis for determining foreign market value, we calculatedforeign market value based on delivered prices to unrelated customers inthe home market. We made deductions from the home market price, where appropriate,for inland freight, inland insurance, home market packing, and cash discounts.We modified cash discounts based on verified information. We added U.S.packing to the home market price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit. We modified GMN's creditexpenses based on verified information. (<T3>See, </T3>Credit Expense section of Appendix B.) We also made deductionsfrom the home market price for commissions paid by GMN to unrelated parties.We also deducted certain indirect selling expenses which include: advertising,inventory carrying expenses and technical services, in accordance with19 CFR 353.15(c). We modified inland freight expense based on verified information. (<T3>See</T3>, Inland Freight section of Appendix B.) We made an upward adjustment to the tax-exclusive home market prices forthe value-added tax we computed for United States price. C. <T3>INA: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We added interest revenue earnedon each transaction, where appropriate. We made deductions from the homemarket price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,home market packing and discounts and rebates. For U.S. packing expenses, INA reported only repacking which occurred atthe U.S. warehouse; it did not include the packing costs incurred in thehome market for shipment to the United States. Therefore, as the best informationavailable for U.S. packing, we calculated an average U.S. packing expensefor each product. We then subtracted the reported home market packing andadded the average U.S. packing expense to the home market price, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act.Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we deducted credit expenses fromhome market price. We also deducted indirect selling expenses which include:advertising, technical services, warranty expenses, quality control expenses,inventory carrying costs, product liability and other miscellaneous indirectselling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). We modified the following claims based on verified information: Creditexpenses, inland insurance, technical services, advertising, inventorycarrying costs, warranty expenses, and indirect selling expenses. (<T3>See, </T3>Selling Expenses section of Appendix B.) We made an upward adjustment to the tax-exclusive home market prices forthe value-added tax we computed for United States price. D. <T3>SKF: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. II. Spherical Roller Bearings <T3>FAG: </T3>Petitioner alleged that FAG's home market sales of sphericalroller bearings were made at prices below the COP. Based on petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on FAG's production costs. Wecalculated the COP as described above for ball bearings. The COP data submittedby FAG was relied upon, except in those instances listed above for ballbearings. In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market prices since there were sufficient home marketsales at or above the COP. We calculated foreign market value based on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelatedcustomers in the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>Market Viability section of Appendix B.) The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>FAG: </T3>Petitioner alleged that FAG's home market sales of cylindricalroller bearings were made at prices below the COP. Based on petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on FAG's production costs. Wecalculated the COP as described above for ball bearings. We calculatedforeign market value based on CV where appropriate as described above forball bearings. Where we found that sufficient sales were above cost topermit the use of these sales as the basis for determining foreign marketvalue, we calculated foreign market value based on packed, c.i.f. pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings. B. <T3>INA: See, </T3>Best Information Available and Cost of Production sectionsof Appendix B. C. <T3>SKF: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. IV. Needle Roller Bearings A. <T3>FAG: </T3>Petitioner alleged that FAG's home market sales of needleroller bearings were made at prices below the COP. Based on petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on FAG's production costs. Wecalculated the COP as described above for ball bearings. We calculatedforeign market value based on CV where appropriate as described above forball bearings. Where we found that sufficient sales were above cost topermit the use of these sales as the basis for determining foreign marketvalue, we calculated foreign market value based on packed, c.i.f. pricesto unrelated customers in the home market.

V. Spherical Plain Bearings A. <T3>FAG: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for spherical plain bearingsbased on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customers in the home market.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.B. <T3>SKF: See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>We used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of U.S. sales,in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, as amended by section615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currency conversions weremade at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances </ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from the FRG. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) (i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>We generally consider the following factors in determining whether importshave been massive over a relatively short period of time: (1) The volumeand value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3)the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports.Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we requested specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.We have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supplymonthly volume shipment data from January l986 through the present in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determinations oncompany-specific data. We were unable to verify the shipment data providedby SKF and INA. (<T3>See,</T3> Critical Circumstances section of Appendix B.) Therefore,as best information available, we are assuming that imports from INA andSKF have been massive over a relatively short period of time. Based onour analysis of the monthly shipment data submitted by FAG and GMN, andthe best information available for INA and SKF, we have found that importsof the following classes or kinds of merchandise from the companies listedbelow have been massive over a relatively short period of time. <ITAG tagnum="14">1. Ball Bearings_INA, SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">2. Spherical Roller Bearings_FAG </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings_FAG, INA, SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">4. Needle Roller Bearings_FAG, INA, SKF </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">5. Spherical Plain Bearings_SKF </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) aremet for the above companies and classes or kinds of merchandise. We examined recent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currentlyno findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the subjectmerchandise by FRG manufacturers, producers, and exporters of the subjectmerchandise. However, it is our standard practice to impute knowledge ofdumping under section 735(a)(3)(A) of the Act when the estimated marginsin our determinations are of such a magnitude that the importer shouldrealize that dumping exists with regard to the subject merchandise. Normallywe consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient.[<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy</T3>(52 FR 24198, June 29, 1987).] However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficient. [<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; CertainInternal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR12552, April 15, 1988)).] Since [FAG, INA, and SKF] sell in the UnitedStates through related companies, and their margins are sufficiently high,we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(A) are met for thesecompanies with respect to the classes or kinds listed below.

FAG-FRG contends that the Department has before it an enormous body ofevidence from numerous sources which contradicts petitioner's allegationthat the subject merchandise constitutes a single class or kind. SKF and NTN contend that the Department properly determined that thereare at least five classes or kinds of merchandise covered by these investigationsand that there is ample evidence of record to support this determination.INA-FRG supports the Department's conclusion that the circumstances inthe instant case are appropriate for finding five distinct classes or kindsof merchandise. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We determine that the products under investigationconstitute five separate classes or kinds of merchandise. Having carefullyconsidered all the information and arguments presented, we find no reasonto alter the conclusion reached in our July 13, 1988 memorandum that thescope of these investigations include five classes or kinds of merchandise.The petition in these investigations characterized the products under investigationas a single class or kind of merchandise, as did the Department's noticesof initiation. Subsequent to our initiations, several respondents and interestedparties expressed strong disagreement with the presumption that the subjectmerchandise constituted a single class or kind. Given the information gatheredsubsequent to the initiations, the enormous diversity and multiplicityof individual products encompassed by the proposed single class or kindof ``antifriction bearings,'' and the ITC determination of several likeproducts and industries, the Department decided to reexamine the classor kind of merchandise, as described in the petition. (See also discussionbelow regarding the Department's authority to define the class or kindof merchandise.) On July 13, 1988, after a thorough examination of this issue, the Departmentdetermined that the evidence of record warranted a subdivision of the merchandiseunder investigation into five classes or kinds. <T3>See </T3>Memorandum from Michael J. Coursey, Director, Office of Investigations,to Jan Mares, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, dated July13, 1988. In that memorandum, the Department used the <T3>Diversified Products Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>572 F. Supp. 883 (CIT 1983) criteria as the basisfor its finding that the merchandise subject to these investigations actuallycomprised five classes or kinds of merchandise. These criteria are: (1)The general physical characteristics; (2) the ultimate use; (3) the expectationsof the ultimate purchaser; (4) the channels of trade; and (5) the mannerof advertising and display. Since then, the parties have briefed the class or kind issue extensively.After considering all the arguments presented, the Department has no reasonto alter the July 13, 1988 decision.In order to appreciate the dilemma facing the Department in assessing whetherthere were single or multiple classes or kinds, we note that more than80,000 bearing part numbers are used in the United States today. The subjectmerchandise is manufactured over a wide range of sizes, from only a fractionof an inch in diameter to over 40 feet. Some AFBs employ balls as rollingelements; others employ needle, spherical, or cylindrical rollers as rollingelements; still others employ sliding contact surfaces in lieu of rollingelements to address friction. AFBs are finished to a wide range of tolerancesand can be assembled with tight or loose fits. Customers may purchase commoditybearings ``off the shelf,'' or specialty bearings made to order. Further,the subject merchandise is produced in a variety of designs, and oftenwith special features, such as enhanced flanges, for ease of mounting orto improve performance. The application environment is extremely diverse. AFBs are used under water,underground, in space, in very hot or cold places, and in corrosive environments.The loads on an AFB can be radial, axial, or a measure of both, and oftenvary in intensity as the bearing rotates. The shaft on which the AFB ismounted can be high speed, low speed, or oscillatory. The application mayinvolve axial displacement, or be subject to misalignment. As frictionis the major constraint to machine performance, the subject merchandisecan literally be found in almost any machinery or equipment that has movingparts. Almost all modern industries, from transportation, aviation, communications,and computers to logging, mining, and steel production utilize equipmentwhich employ AFBs of some type.  Despite the enormous breadth of the merchandise covered by the petition,petitioner has argued throughout these proceedings that a single classor kind of merchandise exists on the basis that all AFBs have the samegeneral physical characteristics [outer race, inner race, balls or rollerelements and cage] and serve the same general function [to reduce frictionand wear between moving and fixed parts, and thereby, permit easier andfaster motion]. Respondents, on the other hand, collectively have contendedthat numerous classes or kinds exist on the basis of differences in size,type, precision, and application. Faced with these two extreme analyses, the Department applied the <T3>Diversified Products</T3> criteria (noted above) to the facts in theseinvestigations. Our analysis showed that the shape of the rolling element(in ball, cylindrical, needle, and spherical roller bearings) or the slidingcontact surfaces (in spherical plain bearings) determined or limited theAFB's key functional capabilities (<T3>e.g.,</T3> load and speed). In turn, these capabilities establishedthe boundaries of the AFB's ultimate use and customer expectations. Webelieve that these factors are the critical ones in determining that fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise exist in these investigations. We, therefore,have distinguished the subject merchandise on the basis of the shape ofthe rolling element (in the case of ball and roller bearings) and slidingcontact surfaces (in the case of spherical plain bearings). The rolling element and sliding contact surfaces are the essential componentsof the subject merchandise. These components bear the load and permit rotation.A change in the geometry of these components changes the load/speed capabilityof the AFB and,  thus, the applications for which the AFB is suited. SeeDepartment Memorandum, dated July 13, 1988. There are, of course, overlapsbetween AFBs in terms of load/speed capabilities, but there is enough separationthat the market continues to demand a range of AFBs with different rollingelement and sliding contact surface geometries. The demand for a range of AFBs with different rolling element and slidingcontact surface geometries arises from applications in which load/speedrequirements can vary greatly. There are, of course, other functional andperformance requirements that vary across applications (<T3>e.g.,</T3> available space, noise levels, stiffness, precision, misalignmentcapability, axial displacement, and frequency of mounting and dismounting).However, the load/speed requirement is reflective of the primary AFB function(to reduce friction and wear between moving and fixed parts), and is therefore,common to all applications. For instance, in ball bearing applications,the ball bearing must be able to withstand high revolutions per minute(rpms) under low load conditions. As a result, a ball bearing purchaserdoes not expect the ball bearing to perform under heavy load conditions.Similarly, spherical roller bearing applications require that the sphericalroller bearing be able to withstand heavy loads at moderate rpms. As aresult, the spherical roller bearing purchaser does not expect this AFBto perform under very high rpm conditions. Since applications and expectations depend on functional capabilities (<T3>e.g.,</T3> load/speed), and these, in turn, are dependent upon rollingelement and sliding contact surface geometries, a division of ultimateuse and expectations of the ultimate  purchaser results which parallelsa division of AFBs on the basis of the rolling element or sliding contactsurface geometry. Moreover, the focus on load/speed capability in the analysisof expectations and applications is consistent with the fact that for bearings,like for other producer-goods, functional capability is the basis for selectionby the customer. Petitioner's analysis fails to account for the fact that different rollingelement and sliding surface geometries result in different functional capabilitiesof the AFBs and, thus, in different AFBs altogether. Furthermore, petitioner'sdefinition of common function (to reduce friction and wear between movingand fixed parts, and thereby, permit easier and faster motion) appliesto oil and other lubricants, non-stick surfaces such as teflon, and manyother products as well as to the subject merchandise. In contrast, respondents'collective analysis does account for physical and application-specificdifferences of the subject merchandise, but to a degree that would leadto absurd results in determining the number of classes or kinds. In addition,we have viewed engineering design variations (such as dimensions or precisionlevels) as qualitative variations which are not so fundamental as to providea basis for distinguishing classes or kinds. As for channels of distribution and advertising, we acknowledge that thesemay be generally the same for many of the AFBs under investigation. Wedo not believe, however, that similarity in channels of distribution andadvertising, alone, is sufficient reason to treat the subject merchandiseas a single class or kind of merchandise when significantly more important dissimilarities exist with respect to physical characteristics, ultimateuses, and expectations of the ultimate user. For further analysis of the<T3>Diversified Products</T3> criteria, as applied to these investigations,see the discussion below. For all of the above reasons, we determine that the products under investigationconstitute five separate classes or kinds of merchandise. <T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department lacks the authorityto alter the class or kind of merchandise to be investigated, as definedin the petition, unless the petition contains inadequate allegations oris unsupported by evidence reasonably available to the petitioner (citing<T3>Mitsubishi Electric Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 12 CIT<T2>XXX</T2>, Slip Op. 88-152 at 43 n.3 (October 31, 1988) and <T3>Royal Business Machines</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> l CIT 80, 87, 507 F. Supp. 1007, 1014 (1980), <T3>aff'd</T3>, 69 C.C.P.A. 61, 660 F. 2d 692 (1982)). Petitioner alsoargues that respondents and interested parties have failed to establishthat antifriction bearings should be subdivided into more than one classor kind of merchandise. INA and NSK contend that the Department has the inherent power to establishthe parameters of the investigation in order to carry out its intent (citing<T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Cellular MobileTelephones and Subassemblies from Japan,</T3> (50 FR 45447, 45449, October31, 1985). SKF argues that this authority is analogous to the Department'sauthority to reconsider decisions to initiate an antidumping investigation(citing <T3>Kokusai Electric Co.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 632 F. Supp. 23, 28 (CIT 1986) (citing <T3>Gilmore Steel Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 585 F.  Supp. 670 (CIT 1984)). Without this inherentauthority, NSK argues that the Department would be tied to an initial scopedefinition that was based on whatever information the petitioner may havehad available to it at the time of filing the petition, and which may notmake sense in light of the information available to the Department or subsequentlyobtained in the investigation (citing <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: 3.5</T3>&quot; Microdisksand Coated Media Thereof from Japan (``Microdisks''), (54 FR 6433, 6434,February 10, 1989). INA further notes that the Department has used itsdiscretion to define the classes or kinds of merchandise under investigationand, if necessary, has modified the scope of a petition in conducting itsinvestigations (citing <T3>Certain Iron Construction Castings from Canada; Final Determinationof Sales at Less Than Fair Value</T3> (``Castings''), (51 FR 2412, 2415,January 16, 1986); <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain StainlessSteel Butt-Weld Pipe and Tube Fittings from Canada</T3>, (53 FR 3227, 3230,February 4, 1988). SKF notes that the Court of International Trade recentlyupheld the Department's authority to define and clarify the scope of aninvestigation (citing <T3>Mitsubishi Electric Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 12 CIT<T2>XXX</T2>, Slip Op. 88-152 (Oct. 31, 1988)). The Bearings Importers Group (``BIG'') of the Aerospace Industries Associationof America (``AIA'') argues that 19 U.S.C. 1673a(c) directs the Departmentto investigate ``the'' class or kind described in the petition, which presupposesthat the petition will only describe one class or kind of merchandise.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with petitioner. The Department hasthe authority to define and clarify the scope of merchandise to be investigated,as described in the petition, if the circumstances require such action.The Court of International Trade has recognized such authority in <T3>Royal Business Machines, </T3>507 F. Supp. at 1014; <T3>Diversified Products</T3> v. <T3>United States, </T3>572 F. Supp. 883 (CIT 1983); and <T3>Mitsubishi Electric, </T3>Slip Op. 88-152 at 43 (holding that the Departmenthas the authority to define and/or clarify what constitutes the subjectmerchandise to be investigated as set forth in the petition). Respondentscorrectly point out that the Department has the inherent power to establishthe parameters of an investigation so as to carry out its mandate to administerthe law effectively and in accordance with congressional intent. Petitioneritself conceded at the public hearing on Antifriction Bearings from Swedenthat it ``would not rule out some situation that would be serious enoughto suggest that there is an inherent authority [for the Department to alterthe scope of the merchandise to be investigated, as defined in the petition]''.<T3>See </T3>Transcript of Proceedings, Hearing on the Antidumping Investigationof Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and PartsThereof from Sweden, February 9, 1989 at 20-21. For these reasons, theDepartment disagrees with petitioner's contention that respondents andinterested parties have the burden to establish the existence of multipleclasses or kinds of merchandise. For the purpose of these investigations, however, the Department has notaltered or narrowed the overall scope of the merchandise under investigation,as described in the petition. Rather, after a thorough briefing by theparties and extensive consultation with the Department of Commerce's Officeof Industrial Resource Administration (OIRA), the U.S. Customs Service,and the ITC, the Department determined that petitioner's description ofthe subject merchandise in the petition was so broad that it encompassedfive classes or kinds of merchandise. See discussion above regarding theDepartment's class or kind decision. The Department disagrees with ``BIG'' that 19 U.S.C. 1673a(c) presupposesthat only one class or kind of merchandise will be named in a petition.Merely because a domestic party combines cases together in one documentdoes not mean that they constitute one petition. For example, petitionersfrequently combine cases on various countries together in one document.Nevertheless, where petitioners do include more than one class or kindwithin one petition, the Department treats the investigation of each classor kind of merchandise as a separate investigation, just as we did duringthe present investigations. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not haveapplied the <T3>Diversified Products </T3>criteria during this investigation in makingits determination that five classes or kinds of merchandise exist. Petitionerclaims that these criteria should only be applied to the issue of whethera particular product is within the scope of an already existing antidumpingduty order. Petitioner notes that the Department, itself, has taken thisposition in litigation before the Court of International Trade (citingDefendant's Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Judgmenton the Agency Record as to Counts II through VI of Their Complaint as Supplemented,dated November 10, 1988 in <T3>NTN Bearing Corporation </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Court No. 87-11-01066). <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with petitioner. Although the Departmenttraditionally applied the <T3>Diversified Products </T3>criteria to determine whether a product wascovered by an outstanding antidumping or countervailing duty order, inrecent years, the Department has relied on such criteria in defining andclarifying the scope of several of its investigations. See <T3>Cellular Mobile Telephones, </T3>(50 FR at 45449); <T3>Castings, </T3>(51 FR at 2415); <T3>Erasable Programmable Read Only Memories from Japan, Final Determinationof Sales at Less Than Fair Value </T3>(``EPROMS''), (51 FR 39680, 39685,October 30, 1986); <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, Certain ForgedSteel Crankshafts from the Federal Republic of Germany, </T3>(52 FR 28170,28174, July 28, 1987); <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Granular PolytetrafluoroethyleneResin from Italy </T3>(``PTFE''), (53 FR 26096, 26097, July 11, 1988);and <T3>Microdisks, </T3>(54 FR at 6434). In fact, the Court of International Trade recently endorsed the Department'suse of such criteria in defining and clarifying the class or kind of merchandiseduring the investigation on cellular mobile telephones and subassemblies,cited above. <T3>Mitsubishi Electric Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-152 at 46 (October 31, 1988). In thepresent investigations, the Department relied on these criteria in determiningthat the single class or kind of merchandise, as defined by petitioner,should be subdivided into five classes or kinds of merchandise. <T3>See </T3>discussion above regarding the Department's class or kinddecision. Petitioner correctly notes that, in litigation currently pendingbefore the Court of International Trade, the Department inadvertently overlookedthe fact that the Office of Investigations has applied the <T3>Diversified Products </T3>criteria to define and clarify the scopeof the various investigations cited above. <T3>Comment 4. </T3>Petitioner argues that a review of several of the Department'spast administrative determinations reveals that a single class or kindof merchandise often consisted of a variety of products, different in physicalcharacteristics and end use (citing <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain Valves,Couplings, Nozzles, and Connections of Brass, Suitable for Use in FireProtection Systems from Italy </T3>(``Fire Protection Products''), (49FR 47066, 47067, November 30, 1984); <T3>Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan; Final Results of AdministrativeReview of Antidumping Duty Order </T3>(``PETS''), (48 FR 7768, 7769, February24, 1983); <T3>Castings, </T3>(51 FR at 2415; <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain FreshCut Flowers from Mexico </T3>(``Flowers''), (52 FR 6361, 6362, March 3,1987); <T3>Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color from Japan; Final Resultsof Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </T3>(52 FR 8940, 8946, March20, 1987); and <T3>Certain Steel Wire Nails from the Republic of Korea; Antidumping: FinalDetermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Exclusions from FinalDetermination </T3>(``Nails''), (47 FR 27392, 27393, June 24, 1982).Petitioner argues that, since the Department apparently used (1) similarityof production facilities and processes; (2) common marketing and distribution;and (3) general use of the merchandise as the relevant criteria in determiningthe presence of one class or kind in an earlier investigation (citing <T3>Castings</T3>), it should do so here. If the above three criteria areused, petitioner argues that, since all types of antifriction bearingsare produced in common facilities, are marketed and distributed throughcommon channels, and are generally used for the same purposes, the Departmentshould find that there is only one single class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation for purposes of these final determinations. Finally,petitioner argues that the Department should follow <T3>Citrosuco </T3>at 26-27 and H.R. Rep. No. 40, 100th Cong., 1st Sess.143 (1987) in making its final determination by either conforming to orexplaining the reasons for its departure from its prior determinations.SKF contends that it is clear from the responses to the cost of productionquestionnaire [<T3>See </T3>Section D Questionnaire Responses] that all antifriction bearingsare <T3>not </T3>manufactured on the same equipment, by the same workers, andin the same facility and according to the same manufacturing process. WhileSKF concedes that early in the bearing manufacturing process, some commonmachinery may be used, SKF argues that this is not true with regard tothe later processes, where most of the value is added, as demonstratedduring verification. SKF notes that petitioner, itself, rationalizes itsproduction based on size, type of rolling element, and level of precision,<T3>citing </T3>USITC Preliminary Conference Transcript, April 21, 1988at 88. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>A review of the cited Department determinationsshows that it is extremely difficult to use the class or kind analysisfrom one investigation as precedent for another investigation, unless theproducts are quite similar and, therefore, closely analogous. Also, the kind of analysis proposed by petitioner would require the reviewof all of the technical data and industry analyses that the Departmenthad on record at the time of each of its class or kind decisions; the narrownessof the scope and class or kind, as proposed by petitioner during each ofthe investigations; the arguments and submissions filed by any oppositionto the breadth of the scope or class or kind; as well as any internal researchand memoranda with respect to these issues. We disagree with petitioner that the Department must accept a broadly-definedclass or kind of merchandise simply because orders we have issued in thepast allegedly include a wide range of products within a single class orkind of merchandise. Normally, the Department will accept the class orkind of merchandise as defined by the petitioner. However, where respondentsargue that the class or kind is overly broad, or where the Department developsinformation in the course of its investigation to this effect, it is appropriatefor the Department to apply the <T3>Diversified Products </T3>analysis, as we have done in these investigations.It also should be noted that the criteria petitioner claims the Departmentshould use and has used (citing <T3>Castings</T3>) are really the <T3>Diversified Products </T3>criteria, discussed in the above comments.In analyzing physical characteristics, the Department has sometimes lookedat the similarity of production facilities and processing of the productsin question to see whether two products were significantly similar to warrantfinding a single class or kind of merchandise. <T3>See PTFE from Italy, </T3>(53 FR at 26097). The evidence presentedduring these investigations, however, was inconclusive with respect tothe common manufacturing facilities, workers, and machinery allegedly usedin the production of all antifriction bearings. While a number of companieshave rationalized various segments of their bearing production, some ofthis rationalization is based on rolling element shape, while some is basedon dimensional ranges of the bearings with little regard to type. Theremay also be certain flexibility in the types of AFBs which can be producedon a particular machine. Since this evidence is inconclusive, we did notfocus on the similarity between production facilities and processing inour analysis of general physical characteristics. Instead, as discussedbelow, we focused on the type of rolling element and sliding surfaces (forspherical plain bearings) characteristic to the subject merchandise. <T3>Comment 5. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department erred in determiningthat the general physical characteristics among AFBs warranted a findingof five classes or kinds of merchandise under investigation. First, petitionercontends that the relevant physical characteristics are not the specific,internal components of a given article, so much as the general attributesthat define its essential character. Petitioner argues that it is the innerand outer races, rolling elements, and cage that define an AFB. Second,there is no evidence in the record to support the Department's determinationthat the physical differences <T3>between </T3>each of the proposed categories are substantially moresignificant than any differences among products <T3>within </T3>the proposed categories. Petitioner argues that, on thecontrary, there is ample support on the record establishing that the generalphysical characteristics of all AFB's are the same. Third, the Department'sfocus on the internal rolling element as a physical characteristic worthyof note cannot be reconciled with previous administrative determinations,given the virtually identical function shared by the AFBs under investigation(citing <T3>EPROMS from Japan; Castings from Canada; Bicycle Speedometers fromJapan,</T3> (47 FR 28978, July 2, 1982); <T3>PETS from Japan; Television Receivers from Japan; Final Determinationof Sales at Less Than Fair Value; High Capacity Pagers from Japan, </T3>(48FR 28682, June 23, 1983); and <T3>Certain Electric Motors from Japan; Antidumping: Final Determinationof Sales of Large Motors at Less Than Fair Value and Suspension of Investigationfor Small Motors, </T3>(45 FR 73723, November 6, 1980)). Finally, the Department'ssubdivision of the subject merchandise into five classes or kinds producesabsurd results when confronted with multiple-row bearings incorporatingdifferent roller types. SKF argues that petitioner's request for one class or kind is illogicalbecause the sole class or kind would include products which do not sharethe essential characteristics, as outlined by petitioner (<T3>e.g., </T3>spherical plain bearings do not contain a rolling element),and use (reduction of friction), while products which clearly share theseoverly broad elements are excluded (<T3>e.g., </T3>tapered roller bearings). SKF also contends that the internal geometry of the five classes or kindsof bearings varies to such a degree that it results in widely divergentgeneral physical characteristics, different uses and different performanceexpectations by customers. For example, since contact is concentrated ata single point in ball bearings (in contrast with the <T3>line </T3>contact of a cylindrical or needle roller bearing), ballbearings have a lower load-carrying capacity than cylindrical and needleroller bearings. Given the geometry of cylindrical and needle roller bearings,these bearings can accommodate heavy loads but only in a single directionand at varying speeds (cylindrical-high speed and needle-moderate speed).<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with petitioner. There can be no doubtthat the subject merchandise differs with respect to the shape of the rollingelement (or the lack of rolling elements in the case of spherical plainbearings). Simple visual inspection reveals noticeable and significantphysical differences. However, the question to be addressed is not whetherthere are physical differences between the various bearings, since theanswer is obviously yes. The real question is whether the physical differencesare so material as to alter the essential nature of the product and, therefore,rise to the level of class or kind distinctions. We believe that the physicaldifferences between the five classes or kinds of the subject merchandiseare fundamental and are more than simply minor variations on a theme.As discussed in our July 13, 1988 memorandum on class or kind, the shapeof the rolling element establishes the functional limitations of ball androller bearings as to load and speed, and, by extension, ultimate use andexpectations. Therefore, there is no other physical characteristic amongthese bearings more fundamental than the shape of the most essential component,the rolling element. Spherical plain bearings, on the other hand, do not contain rolling elements.Instead, they are composed of inner and outer rings which form a sphericallyshaped bearing surface and which slide in relation to one another. Thisconfiguration establishes different functional limitations, ultimate usesand expectations than those that are characteristic to the ball and rollerbearings discussed above. This configuration is fundamental to the natureof the spherical plain bearing and, therefore, is a basis for our distinctionof this class or kind of merchandise. For the purposes of clarifying scope and making its class or kind determination,the Department found that the difference in roller elements and in thecase of spherical plain bearings, the sliding surface configuration, wasmuch more significant than numerous differences in size, precision level,and applications within each respective category of AFB. As discussed inthe above comments, the Department's decision to define class or kind accordingto these essential elements is well supported by the record due to thefact that the rolling element and sliding surface geometry, in turn, determinesthe functional capability, ultimate use, and customer expectations of thesubject merchandise. Conversely, given the tremendous variations amongsizes, precision levels and applications applicable to AFBs, the Department'ssubdivision of scope based on these characteristics would have led to numerousclasses or kinds and absurd results. Petitioner's reliance on the administrative cases cited in this commentis misplaced as well, for the same reasons discussed in the above comment.Further, the Department is focusing on the rolling elements and slidingsurfaces (spherical plain) and their corresponding functional capabilitiesin determining class or kind for the purposes of <T3>these </T3>investigations because the technical data and industry analysison record, the breadth of the scope, as described in the petition, as wellas the arguments raised by respondents in opposition to a single classor kind indicate that such a focus is warranted. Finally, the fact that there are certain AFBs which incorporate multiplerows of different types of rolling elements [combination bearings] foruse in limited, unusual applications does not alter the Department's findingthat the subject merchandise comprised five classes or kinds of merchandise.For instance, in the case of a combination needle roller/angular contactball bearing, the relative position of the balls in an angular contactarrangement allows the bearing unit to withstand thrust loads which a radialneedle roller bearing alone could not accept. However, the needle and ballbearings contained in the combination unit still retain their functionalcapabilities and separate identities. Therefore, in combination units,a different ``bearing'' is not created as much as an enhanced one. Thecombination unit is still designed for use where high radial loads areencountered but now accepts some thrust (or axial) forces as well. <T3>Comment 6. </T3>Petitioner contends that, contrary to the Department'sfindings in the July 13, 1988 Memorandum on Class or Kind, the record evidenceestablishes that the various bearing types distinguished by the Departmentare, in fact, suitable for many of the same uses and that there is a greatdegree of interchangeability between different bearing types, and thus,should constitute one class or kind of merchandise under investigation.Further, the Department has concluded in other investigations that thelack of perfect substitutability does not splinter the class or kind (citing<T3>Tapered Roller Bearings from Japan, EPROMS from Japan, Castings fromCanada, Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from the United Kinqdom and ColorTelevision Receivers from Korea</T3>). Petitioner has argued throughoutthese proceedings that the general function of all of the AFB's under investigationis to reduce friction and wear between moving and fixed parts, and thereby,permit easier and faster motion. SKF argues that petitioner's definition of ultimate use as the reductionof friction was so patently broad that a single class or kind would includeautomobile tires, lubricants, and non-stick surfaces, as well as all ofthe AFBs under investigation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with petitioner. One of the most persuasivepieces of evidence that all of the AFBs under investigation are not equallysimilar in their ultimate use is the obvious fact that there are numeroustypes of AFBs currently in production [ball bearings (including deep grooveball, self-aligning ball, angular contact ball, thrust ball bearings);cylindrical roller bearings (including cylindrical roller thrust bearings);spherical roller bearings (including spherical roller thrust); needle rollerbearings; spherical plain bearings; tapered roller bearings as well asmany others]. The apparent reason is that different types of AFBs are suitedto different applications and uses. If, as petitioner contends, all AFBswere equally suitable in all applications, bearing manufacturers wouldnot manufacture the diverse types of AFBs that they in fact produce. As discussed above in the general discussion regarding the Department'sclass or kind decision, the rolling elements and sliding surfaces establishthe limitations of the AFB's load and speed capabilities, the criticalfunctional capabilities in the achievement of friction reduction. For example,the point contact between the ball and the races in a ball bearing enablesthe bearing to operate at relatively high speed applications but reducesits load carrying capability. By contrast, the line contact between thecylindrical roller and the races in a cylindrical roller bearing increasesits load capabilities but with some sacrifice in speed. Such load/speedcapabilities directly determine the uses and applications in which thebearing may be employed. Petitioner argues that there is a great degree of interchangeability betweenthe bearings under investigation, especially at the design stage of manufacturedproducts which incorporate these bearings. While this may have limitedvalidity in a theoretical sense, it has little practical application becauseAFBs are almost always ``design followers.'' In almost any AFB application,a ``best engineering'' solution is normally indicated by weighing variousoperating factors in the application environment as to which type bearing,or combination of types to use. These factors include, but are not limitedto, available space, load, speed, noise, axial displacement, mounting technique,misalignment, precision and stiffness. Again, load and speed are the criticalcriteria with respect to friction reduction. Only within certain narrowlimits may other AFB types be fashioned to satisfy the application withoutsignificantly compromising the machine's performance. However, once theengineering criteria for bearing type selection has been established, switchingto another type is restricted technically and/or economically, and willfrequently result in a significant reduction in performance. Accordingly,while examples of interchangeability at the design stage may be found,they are comparatively rare. Interchangeability at the replacement stageis almost nil. For the above reasons, the Department does not find that its determinationwith respect to ultimate use in these investigations conflicts with theearlier cases cited by petitioner since the lack of a substantial degreeof substitutability and interchangeability was not our sole basis for findingthat the AFBs under investigation involved distinctly different functionalcapabilities and ultimate uses. Rather, the Department has found that thelack of a substantial degree of substitutability and interchangeabilitybetween the bearings under investigation supports the Department's findingthat five classes or kinds of merchandise exist. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Petitioner argues that, contrary to the Department'spreliminary determinations, customer expectations do not vary among bearingtypes. In general, customers have a need for an antifriction device andan engineering design that must accommodate a bearing for that application.Thus, customers expect to be sold an AFB to meet specific requirements,rather than a particular type of AFB. Given the use of a single sales force,the actual purchasing patterns of customers, and the fact that AFBs aresold according to specification, the Department should find that thereis only one class or kind of merchandise under investigation.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We believe that the five classes or kinds of merchandisehave distinct customer expectations, given their distinctly different generalphysical characteristics and ultimate uses. The five classes or kinds ofmerchandise that we have established reflect the different functional capabilitiesand limitations (load/speed in particular) of each class or kind of merchandise.Customer expectations will differ accordingly, as discussed in the abovegeneral discussion regarding the Department's class or kind decision. Forthese reasons, the Department disagrees with petitioner that customershave the same expectations for ball bearings, spherical roller bearings,needle roller bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, and spherical plainbearings. See our July 13, 1988 memorandum for further discussion. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner contends that the channels of trade andadvertising utilized by AFB manufacturers do not vary among bearing types.In fact, AFB manufacturers generally promote the full range of AFBs, notindividual AFB types. Further, given AFB interchangeability, the marketingof a single product category, the use of one catalog for all AFB types,and advertisements promoting the substitutability of bearing types, theDepartment should find that there is only one class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation. Finally, petitioner argues that the Department's determinationis inconsistent with its class or kind determinations in <T3>Fire Protection Products, Nails from the Republic of Korea, and CertainCarbon Steel Products from Belgium </T3>(finding one class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation while disregarding the fact that the catalogs on recorddemonstrated separate categories of merchandise, physical differences,and differences in application). SKF argues that the channels of trade and means of promotion further supportthe existence of multiple classes or kinds of bearings. SKF notes thatspherical plain bearings and needle roller bearings are excluded from theSKF General Catalogue. In addition, spherical plain bearings are sold throughthe SKF Specialty Bearings Division, as opposed to the Industries or ServicesDivision which markets the remaining classes or kinds of bearings. Finally,SKF has a separate product manager assigned to each class or kind categoryof AFBs under investigation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The evidence with respect to these criteria is inconclusive.With respect to advertising and display, many types of AFBs are includedin a single catalog, although this may differ with the particular manufacturer.Spherical plain bearings are often not included in the same catalog asball and roller bearings. Many other catalogs group products by specificapplications (<T3>e.g., </T3>automotive bearings), by size (<T3>e.g., </T3>miniature), by precision, by rolling element type, or byspecial application or design (<T3>e.g., </T3>housed bearing units, angular contact bearings, or thrustbearings). With respect to channels of trade, most manufacturers sell all or mostof their AFBs through distributors, while selling only certain AFBs toOEMs. The sales divisions within the AFB manufacturing organizations oftendistinguish their sales and marketing according to the type of customer(<T3>e.g., </T3>distributor versus OEM), industry segment (<T3>e.g., </T3>automotive or aerospace), or specialty products (<T3>e.g., </T3>high precision or thin race ball bearings), rather thanby the type of rolling element. As noted in the general discussion above with respect to the Department'sclass or kind decision, we acknowledge that these criteria may be generallythe same for many of the AFBs under investigation. Nevertheless, we donot believe that similarity in these two criteria alone is sufficient reasonto treat the subject merchandise as a single class or kind of merchandisewhen extremely significant differences exist with respect to general physicalcharacteristics, ultimate uses and customer expectations. <T3>Comment 9. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department's narrowingof class or kind in this investigation will foster circumvention by creatinga tremendous incentive for multinational companies to shift their productionto those products and plants where the duties are lowest. Petitioner notesthat Congress' efforts to amend the antidumping law over the past severalyears with respect to multinational organizations, persistent dumping andcircumvention due to the assembly of parts offshore and in the United Stateshave been directed, in part, at eliminating such incentive. Moreover, sincethe Department has the authority to self-initiate investigations and toexpand the acope of the merchandise under investigation (citing <T3>Citrosuco Paulista S.A. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-176 at 14-15 (December 30, 1988)) andhas in the past expanded the class or kind of merchandise under investigationto include parts or subassemblies (citing <T3>Gold Star Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States </T3>12 CIT <T2>XXX</T2>, 692 F. Supp. 1382 (1988)), petitioner argues that the Departmentshould maintain petitioner's definition of scope as one class or kind inorder to prevent circumvention. SKF argues that petitioner's contention with respect to circumvention defiescredibility since SKF produces the various classes or kinds of merchandiseusing different machinery and equipment, in different facilities, in differentcities, and in different countries; and circumvention would require thewholesale reorganization of its international operations, with a transferof major production lines between countries. FAG FRG contends that petitioner's assertion that the purpose of a broaddefinition of class or kind is to prevent circumvention is novel and notsupported by the anti-circumvention provisions of Section 1321 of the OmnibusTrade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. FAG FRG also argues that petitioner'scontention that multiple classes or kinds would encourage circumventionis without foundation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>As discussed above, we have determined that thesubject merchandise properly constitutes five classes or kinds of merchandise.Given this determination, the Department finds it inappropriate to adoptpetitioner's overly-broad definition of class or kind in order to addresspetitioner's speculation that the multinational companies under investigationmay shift their production to those products and plants where the dutiesare lowest. If respondents do shift their production to a different classor kind of bearing or to a plant in a country where there is a particularlylow cash deposit rate, any dumping of the covered products from countriescovered under the orders would result in the Department's assessment ofthe appropriate duties during any administrative review of those particularorders, since antidumping duties are assessed on a sale-by-sale basis.If respondents do shift their production to facilities in countries notcovered under the orders, then petitioner could seek monitoring reliefunder 19 U.S.C. 1673a(a)(2), the provision which addresses persistent dumpingof covered merchandise from non-covered countries. Therefore, it appearsthat petitioner has other administrative remedies at its disposal shouldits fears materialize. Petitioner cites the recent legislation concerning circumvention, Sec.1321 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, as evidenceof the legislative intent to eliminate the incentive for multinationalcompanies to shift production to avoid paying duties. Through the 1988Act, however, Congress sought to prevent circumvention where merchandiseis completed or assembled either in the United States or in a country notcovered by an existing antidumping duty order. <T3>See </T3>19 U.S.C. 1677j(a), (b) (1988); <T3>see also Mitsubishi Electric Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op, 88-152 at 34-56 (October 31, 1988). Inaddition, Congress sought to reach any merchandise altered in minor respectsfrom the same class(es) or kinds of merchandise already subject to an investigationor order (19 U.S.C. 1677j(c)(1988), and later-developed merchandise whichwould fall within the same class(es) or kind(s) of merchandise alreadycovered under an existing order. <T3>See </T3>19 U.S.C. 1677j(d) (1988). None of these provisions, however,are applicable to this situation. For the reasons listed above, the Departmentfinds no reason to alter its class or kind decision based on petitioner'scircumvention concerns.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 2: Standing </ITAG>During the period April 27 through September 29, 1988, we received numeroussubmissions from parties challenging The Torrington Company's, (``Torrington''),standing to file the petition and requesting dismissal of the petitionon the grounds that it was not filed (1) by ``an interested party,'' or(2) ``on behalf of'' the United States industry as required by section732(b)(1) of the Act. Conversely, between May 9, 1988 and February 27,1989, we received numerous letters from parties in support of the petitionbrought by Torrington. In order to be considered an ``interested party,'' Torrington must meetthe standards of section 771(9) of the Act. Section 771(9)(C) of the Actprovides, in relevant part, that an ``interested party'' is ``a manufacturer,producer, or wholesaler in the United States of a like product.'' Withthe exception of an additional category for ``other antifriction devices,''the ITC's categorization of the subject merchandise into six like productsis identical to the five classes or kinds of merchandise subject to theseinvestigations. Torrington has demonstrated that it produces all five classesor kinds of the subject merchandise. Therefore, Torrington is a manufacturer,producer or wholesaler in the United States of the like products underinvestigation, and is an ``interested party'' with standing to file thispetition. The statutory provision that governs the standing of parties to bring petitionsrequires the commencement of an investigation ``whenever an interestedparty * * * files a petition *** on behalf of an industry.'' Section 732(b)(1)of the Act. As we have stated in prior cases [<T3>see, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; CertainStainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden </T3>(52 FR 5794, February26, 1987) and <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Malaysia</T3> (50 FR 9852, March 12, 1985)],the Department relies upon the petitioner's representations that it hasfiled ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is shown that a majorityof the domestic industry affirmatively opposes the petition. As the Courtof International Trade recognized in <T3>Citrosuco Paulista </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>12 CIT__Slip. Op. at 19, ``[n]either the statutenor Commerce's regulations require a petitioner to establish affirmativelythat it has the support of a majority of a particular industry.'' As we have noted in other cases, to require a petitioner to establish affirmativelythat it has the support of a majority of the industry on whose behalf ithas filed the petition would, in many cases, ``be so onerous as to precludeaccess to import relief under the antidumping and countervailing duty law.''<T3>Final Affirmative Antidumping Duty Determination; Frozen ConcentratedOrange Juice from Brazil; Final Determination of Sales at Less than FairValue, </T3>(``Orange Juice''), (52 FR 8324, 8325, March 17, 1987), <T3>aff'd in Citrosuco Paulista</T3> v. <T3>United States, </T3>supra at 18. When a member of the domestic industry challenges the assertion of thepetitioner that it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry, theburden is on the opponent to establish that the petitioner does not havethe support of a majority of the domestic industry. To meet this requirement,the opponent must provide evidence that at least a majority of the domesticindustry affirmatively opposes the petition. Where domestic industry membersopposing a petition provide a clear indication that there are grounds todoubt a petitioner's standing, the Department will evaluate the oppositionto determine whether the opposing parties do, in fact, represent a majorproportion of the domestic industry. In order to determine whether a major proportion of the domestic industriesoppose the petition, on October 14, 1988, we issued a questionnaire tothose parties challenging the standing of Torrington. In this questionnaire,we requested the opponents to supply information on the nature and extentof their involvement in the domestic industries. We received responsesto the standing questionnaire from October 21, 1988 through November 7,1988. After a careful review of the responses submitted to our standingquestionnaire, we have determined that the opposing parties do not, infact, represent a major proportion of the domestic industries. Neither the antidumping statute nor its legislative history provides theDepartment with clear guidance as to how to apply the ``on behalf of anindustry'' standing requirement. The legislative history of the Trade AgreementsAct of 1979 simply explains that Commerce is to initiate an antidumpingduty investigation <T3>unless </T3>it believes strongly that the petition fails to state aclaim upon which relief can be granted or fails to provide informationin support of the allegations. S. Rep. No. 96-249, 96th Cong. lst Sess.47 (1979). By adopting the standing requirement contained in 19 U.S.C.1675(a)(b)(1), Congress intended to ``provide the opportunity for relieffor an adversely affected industry.'' <T3>Id. </T3>Congress's lack of specificity in establishing the mannerin which the Department was to determine whether a petition was filed ``onbehalf of an industry'' evidences a bestowal upon the Department of therequisite discretion to develop criteria for making the determination.The determination of whether opponents of a petition represent a majorproportion of the domestic industries necessarily requires Commerce toexercise its discretion and judgment based upon an assessment of all thefactors and circumstances peculiar to each case presented to the Department.The responses to our standing questionnaire show that six bearings producersoppose the standing of Torrington with respect to each class or kind ofmerchandise under investigation. The parties in opposition have providedtheir total volume and value of production during the period of investigationfor each of the five classes or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigations.In order to determine whether the opponents represent a majority of thedomestic industries, we cumulated the opponents' U.S. production for eachclass or kind by both quantity and value, and divided these figures bythe respective quantity and value of total U.S. production. We calculatedtotal U.S. production of ball, spherical, and cylindrical bearings usingthe Antifriction Bearing Manufactures Association's (AFBMA) quarterly informationconcerning total U.S. shipments during the period of investigation. Becausethe AFBMA was unable to provide the Department with statistical data onU.S. production of needle and plain bearings, we calculated total U.S.production of needle and plain bearings using the 1987 Census Current IndustrialReport.The Department concludes that the data collected in response to its questionnairefailed to yield information sufficiently convincing to conclude that thepetition was not supported by the domestic industries. Our analysis demonstratesthat the parties in opposition do not represent a majority of the domesticindustries in terms of both quantity and value of production. In responseto our standing questionnaire, some of the opponents based their percentageof market share on the value of their U.S. production, while other opponentsbased percentage of market share upon the volume of their U.S. production.In the absence of any demonstrable evidence establishing either volumeor value of U.S. production as the most representative and appropriatemeasure of market share, Commerce believes that it is consistent with Congressionalintent to require a showing of majority industry opposition based on bothvalue and volume of U.S. production before rescinding an investigation.Having found that the firms which oppose the petition do not representa majority of the domestic industries, we need not address whether thedomestic industries should be defined to exclude related parties or importersfor standing purposes. See section 771(4)(B) of the Act, 19 U.S.C. 1677(4)(B).<T3>Orange Juice,</T3> 52 FR 8324, 8325 (March 17, 1987), <T3>aff'd in Citrosuco Paulista</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> supra at 19-22. Nevertheless, Commerce finds itnecessary to point out that the firms in opposition are wholly-owned U.S.subsidiaries of the foreign respondent firms. These domestic companiesin opposition may be so wed to the foreign respondents and the allegedlydumped imports that their interests would run counter to the impositionof antidumping duties.  Therefore, the Department reaffirms its preliminary determination in thiscase that the petition was filed on behalf of the domestic industries,and that the petitioner has standing to bring this petition. <T3>Comment 1.</T3> Numerous respondents and interested parties have raisedarguments pertaining to the issue of whether the petition in these investigationshas been brought on behalf of the domestic industries producing the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise. For example, NTN argues that Torringtonis only one of 90 firms identified in the petition as members of the U.S.bearing industry. Moreover, Torrington accounts for less than 25 percentof domestic production by value, and for less than 15 percent of ball bearingproduction. These parties also claim that opponents of the petition account for morethat 50 percent of the U.S. industries, production of this merchandise.For example, Koyo and Minebea point to the ITC's finding that 61 percentof total shipments of ball bearings in 1987 were accounted for by foreign-affiliateddomestic producers. They also contend that foreign-affiliated producersrepresent over 50 percent of U.S. ball bearing production capacity. Finally, SKF, FAG, KGS, and Caterpillar argue that the investigations shouldbe terminated for those classes or kinds of merchandise where the Departmentdetermines that the opponents account for more than 50 percent of U.S.production. Torrington argues it is the Department's practice to accept petitioners'allegations that they have filed on behalf of the  U.S. industry untillack of support is demonstrated and that the opponents of the petitionhave not demonstrated this. Torrington also points to the ITC report toargue that producers in opposition to the petition account for only 26.6percent of U.S. production. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> As discussed in the standing section above, it isthe Department's practice to accept a petitioner's claim that the petitionhas been filed on behalf of the U.S. industry until it is demonstratedthat this is not the case. Because of expressions of opposition to thepetition in these cases, we sent questionnaires to the opponents in orderto determine whether they accounted for a majority of the U.S. industries.Based on our analysis of those responses, we have determined that the petitionwas brought on behalf of the U.S. industries and, consequently, have notrescinded these investigations. Although Minebea and Koyo argue that the Department's position would runcounter to the ITC's finding that the companies represented the domesticindustries, considerations which underlie the decisions of the Departmentand the ITC on whether to include these firms as part of the domestic industry,although related, are not the same. <T3>Orange Juice,</T3> supra at 8326). While the ITC considers the opportunityof importers or related parties to conceal the extent of injury to thedomestic industry, the Department must determine the extent to which therelated parties' or importers, interest would run counter to the impositionof antidumping duties. <T3>Id.</T3> <T3>Comment 2. </T3>NTN argues that because opponents of the petition accountfor more of the U.S. production than does Torrington, it is clear thatmore of the domestic industry opposes the petition than supports it. Minebeacontends that the Department should draw an adverse inference from thefailure of any significant domestic producer to step forward in supportof the petition. Finally, NSK argues that the Department cannot determinewhether the petitions have been brought on behalf of the U.S. industriesunless it sends questionnaires to and analyzes the responses of U.S.-owneddomestic producers. Without such responses, the Department lacks a reliable``denominator'' for measuring opposition. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In these cases, we have followed our standard practiceof issuing questionnaires to those parties which express opposition tothe petition. <T3>Orange Juice, </T3>(52 FR 8324, March 17, 1987). As discussed in thestanding section above, we cumulated the production of those companiesand divided it by independently developed denominators. Therefore, we didnot require information from other parties on the extent of their productionor their estimates of their shares of U.S. production. We do not agree with NTN or Minebea that the proper comparison is betweenthe share of U.S. production accounted for by the petitioner and the shareaccounted for by opponents of the petition. We did receive a number ofexpressions of support for the petition from other members of the domesticindustry, such as Pacamor Kubar, Lipe-Rollway Corporation, Federal-MogulCorporation, MPB Corporation, and The Barden Corporation. We think it isreasonable to assume until proven otherwise that those parties which donot express opposition to the petition either support it or have no position.(see, <T3>e.g., Certain Electrical Conductor Aluminum Redraw Rod from Venezuela</T3>(53 FR 24755, June 30, 1988)). <T3>Comment 3. </T3>Numerous respondents and interested parties have submittedcomments on the issue of whether opponents to the petitions should be excludedfrom the domestic industry because they are related to the foreign producerssubject to the investigations or because they import the products underinvestigation. Many claim that they should not be excluded because importsdo not account for a majority of their sales, the ``rule'' the Departmentadopted in <T3>Orange Juice, </T3>(52 FR 8324, March 17, 1987), and that U.S.-owneddomestic producers also import the products subject to investigation. They further claim that they should not be excluded from the U.S. industriesby reason of their relationship to foreign producers. Despite this relationship,they are not shielded from unfairly-traded imports and, in many cases,they operate independently from their foreign owners. Moreover, U.S.-owneddomestic producers are also related to foreign producers subject to theseinvestigations. Finally, many parties claim that the Department should adopt the ITC'streatment of these foreign-owned producers as members of the U.S. industryor at least apply the same factors the ITC applies. The foreign-owned producersare not ``screwdriver operations.'' They have undertaken significant investmentin the United States and their employees and management are predominantlyAmerican. Also, in its section 232 investigation, the Department recognizedthat U.S. affiliates of foreign producers are part of the U.S. antifrictionbearing industry. Torrington claims that the 50 percent import standard employed by the Departmentin <T3>Orange Juice, </T3>supra at 8324, is not applicable in this case becausethe rule reflected the Department's consideration of ``whether the domesticcompanies (were) so wed to allegedly dumped imports that their interestswould run counter to the imposition of antidumping duties.'' The opponents'active participation in this case clearly indicates that their interestsare counter to the imposition of duties. Moreover, in <T3>Orange Juice, </T3>supra at 8324, substantial importation was commonamong the U.S. industry and such is not the case in this investigation.With respect to relationship, Torrington claims that the statute permitsCommerce to exclude foreign-owned producers from the industry merely byvirtue of their relationship to producers covered by the investigation.Torrington further claims that the ITC's inclusion of foreign-owned producersin the U.S. industry arose from the fact that their financial performancewas worse than that of U.S.-owned producers, and that their support foror opposition to the petition is not relevant to the ITC's determinationon whether the industry as a whole is suffering material injury. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Although the Department does have the discretionto exclude companies which import or which are related to foreign producerssubject to the investigation from the domestic industry <T3>Citrosuco Paulista </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>12 CIT <T2>XXX</T2>, Slip Op. 88-176, December 30, 1988, we did not need to doso in these investigations because without excluding these companies wehave still found that opponents of the petition do not account for a majorityof the U.S. industries.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 3: Products Covered </ITAG>Throughout these proceedings, the Department received numerous submissionsrequesting clarification of the products included in the scope of investigation.These submissions ranged from importers requesting that a specific productnot be included in the scope of these investigations to other parties requestingthat a particular product category be treated as a separate class or kindof merchandise subject to investigation. With respect to requests that a certain product not be included in thescope of these investigations, we have looked primarily at the petitionand accompanying exhibits, in order to determine whether petitioner intendedsuch merchandise to be included within the scope of these investigations.Where the petition and accompanying submissions were ambiguous, we hadto determine whether the merchandise in question would properly fall withinthe classes or kinds of merchandise under investigation. In doing so, werelied on comments from the petitioner and interested parties, our researchmemoranda and analyses undertaken in connection with these investigations,as well as on the ITC preliminary determination, questionnaire, and staffreport. Since we were able to make our determinations based upon the documentationnoted above we did not have to rely on the <T3>Diversified Products </T3>criteria in making our scope exclusion determinations.However, for reference these criteria are: (1) The general physical characteristicsof the merchandise; (2) the ultimate use of the merchandise; (3) the expectationsof the ultimate purchaser; (4) the channels of trade; and (5) the mannerin which the merchandise is advertised and displayed. Where we determinedthat a product was excluded from the scope of investigations, we determinedthat it was unnecessary to address any of the parties, concerns that suchmerchandise constituted a separate class or kind of merchandise. <T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner contends, contrary to the assertions ofseveral interested parties, that the petition covers, at a minimum, allplain bearings of a type similar to those produced by the petitioner. Theseproducts include those specifically identified in the petition, such asspherical plain bearings and rod ends, as well as lined bearings/bushings(``metal on metal''), because such products are antifriction bearings.Petitioner disputes the assertions of several interested parties that theDepartment should exclude certain plain bearings other than spherical plainbearings from the scope of the investigations on the basis of the materialused to produce the bearing in question. Petitioner disputes INA's contention that plain bearings in general falloutside the class or kind of merchandise subject to the investigationsbecause such bearings are not ``antifriction bearings.'' Petitioner alsodisputes INA's contention that its Permaglide bearings (<T3>e.g</T3>., bushings, flanged bushings, and thrust washers, and strips)should be excluded from these investigations because the petitioner producesbearings ``virtually identical'' to Permaglide bearings. Nine interested parties contend that plain bearings other than sphericalplain bearings are neither ground antifriction bearings in general, norspherical plain bearings in particular and, therefore, should be excludedfrom the scope of the investigations. Two interested parties contend, inthe alternative, that the Department should find that certain plain bearingsconstitute a separate class or kind of merchandise that is not coveredby either the petition or the investigations. Interested parties contend that plain bearings other than spherical plainbearings include oil-film plain bearings (<T3>e.g</T3>., crankshaft bearings, crankshaft thrust bearings, and pistonpin bushings), so-called ``Permaglide'' bearings (<T3>e.g</T3>., bushings, flanged bushings, and thrust washers and strips),and other plain bearings (<T3>e.g</T3>., fluid film or lubricated, dry rubbing, bi- and tri-metallic,plain journal, journal, and thrust bearings), as well as automobile crankshaftmain bearings, engine connecting rod bearings, and a variety of bushingsused in automotive engines (<T3>e.g</T3>., distributor upper/lower bushings, connecting rods, small-endbushings, clutch pileup bushings, and generator bushings). These productsare used in, among other applications, motor vehicle and aircraft engines,aircraft control devices, transmissions, tractors, and gearboxes. These interested parties base their contentions on the following generalpoints: (1) The petition's detailed description of plain bearings is limitedto spherical plain bearings; thus, the question of whether the petitionermakes other kinds of plain bearings is irrelevant, because the petitiondoes not include any    such bearings; (2) the petitioner did not amendthe petition to cover plain bearings other than spherical plain bearings;(3) the notices of initiation of investigations by both the Departmentand the ITC do not list plain bearings as products subject to these investigations;(4) the ITC's preliminary injury determination did not cover plain bearingsother than spherical plain bearings; (5) the Department's antidumping questionnaire(Appendix V), dated May 31, 1988, did not request sales data for such bearings;as a result, the Department has not included such bearings in its fairvalue analysis; (6) these products are not produced by the petitioner andare not similar to or competitive with any product produced by the petitioner;and (7) such bearings are not part of the class or kind of merchandisewhich includes spherical plain bearings subject to these investigations.With regard to this last point, these interested parties generally contendthat other plain bearings differ from both ground antifriction bearings,in general, and spherical plain bearings, in particular, in terms of generalphysical characteristics, uses, customer expectations, channels of distribution,and methods of advertising and display. The materials, components, andmanufacturing processes used to produce other plain bearings, as well asthe producers and workers who produce the same, are different from thoseused to produce spherical plain bearings or any other kind of antifrictionbearing. Other differences include those related to dimensions, lubrication,and capacity.Specifically, Caterpillar contends that, in contrast to spherical plainbearings or any other kind of antifriction bearing, oil-film bearings havea single component with no rolling elements or other moving parts, suchas balls, cages, or races. Some of these products have a coefficient offriction which is five to ten times greater than that of antifriction bearings.All oil-film bearings cost significantly less than antifriction bearings.Cummins Engine Company, Inc. (``Cummins'') also contends that, in contrastto the surfaces of antifriction bearings, those of oil-film bearings arenot ground. Caterpillar further contends that the ultimate use of oil-film bearingsinvolves applications where radial loads with high variability and speedare encountered, and where self-alignment capability is not required; incontrast, the ultimate use of the spherical plain bearings involves applicationswhere both radial and thrust loads are encountered (<T3>e.g.</T3>, aircraft control elements). Oil-film bearings used in connectionwith engines and other high speed applications (<T3>e.g.</T3>, transmissions, track rollers, tractors, internal power trainuses, as well as pivots on booms, lift arms, and rippers) carry the loadof the rotating shaft on a film of pressurized lubricant. Antifrictionbearings, by contrast, carry the load of the rotating shaft on the bearingsurface. The ultimate purchaser of oil-film bearings, the OEM, purchases a custom-madeproduct tailored to individual applications which are radically differentfrom the expectations of a purchaser of spherical plain bearings; thatis, antifriction bearings and spherical plain bearings are sold in accordancewith industry standard sizes and types. Oil-film bearings, therefore, movein different channels of distribution from antifriction bearings; oil-filmbearings are not sold by antifriction bearing distributors but rather byauthorized OEM dealers who make aftermarket, replacement sales of suchproducts. Finally, in contrast to custom-made oil-film bearings, standardizedantifriction bearings lend themselves to a type of advertising involvingcatalogues that use industry standard designations. Additionally, Caterpillar contends that Federal-Mogul Corporation, theonly U.S. domestic producer of both oil-film bearings and antifrictionbearings, does not support the inclusion of oil-film bearings within thescope of these investigations. Cummins notes that the petitioner does notmanufacture oil-film bearings. Kolbenschmidt AD contends that the petitionerhas stated at pages 3 and 4 of its February 24, 1989, letter to the Departmentthat it does not object to the exclusion of ``oil-film plain bearings''or other plain bearings that are not within the ``class or kind'' of sphericalplain bearings. Glacier Metal Co. Ltd. (``Glacier'') and Vandervell Ltd. (``Vandervell'')contend that spherical plain bearings have a spherically-shaped bearingsurface, are self-aligning, and are manufactured from bearing grade steel;in contrast, plain bearings other than spherical plain bearings_plain journaland thrust bearings, in particular_have a cylindrical bearing surface,are not self-aligning, and are manufactured from a specialized bearinggrade metal alloy. SKF further contends that other plain bearings are notantifriction bearings, because such plain bearings operate on a sliding,rather than rolling, motion. Glacier and Vandervell also contend that, in contrast to other plain bearings(<T3>e.g.,</T3> film lubricated, plain journal, journal, and thrust bearings),spherical plain bearings are used in applications where a combination ofradial and thrust loads are encountered. In contrast to other plain bearings,spherical plain bearings are never considered by a potential customer wherehigh sliding speeds and significant loads are encountered. Spherical plainbearings typically are made by ball and roller bearing manufacturers, arestandarized and interchangeable, and are advertised in catalogues throughthe use of price lists and discount schedules; in contrast, plain bearingsother than spherical plain bearings are manufactured by specialist producers,are custom-made and not interchangeable, and are advertised separatelyfrom spherical plain bearings. NDC Co., Ltd. (``NDC'') contends that, in contrast to the primary functionof antifriction bearings, the function of connecting rod and crankshaftmain bearings_consisting of tin, lead, and copper_is not to reduce friction.Bushings used in automotive engine applications serve primarily as a positioningdevice for a rotating shaft. Additionally, the petitioner does not manufactureany product line either identical or similar to, or interchangeable andcompetitive with, the above noted products.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We determine that spherical plain bearings, whethermounted or housed, including those spherical plain bearings known as rodends and parts thereof, are subject to these investigations. We also determinethat plain bearings and parts thereof, other than spherical plain bearings,are not subject to these investigations. Accordingly, any sales of plainbearings other than spherical plain bearings were not used in our finalcalculations. Spherical plain bearings were the only plain bearings which the petitionand exhibits thereto specifically identified as subject to investigation.(<T3>See </T3>Petition at Executive Summary pages 1 and 3, and pages 13,15, 16, and 19 of the narrative.) Although the petitioner stated in itsletter, dated May 26, 1988, that ``the petition specifically identified<T3>plain bearings </T3>as being covered [by these investigations]'', thisstatement is incorrect. Neither the petition nor the exhibits thereto containa reference, whether express or implied, to plain bearings other than sphericalplain bearings. In addition, petitioner's LTFV allegations with respectto plain bearings were limited to spherical plain bearings. Therefore,there is no indication that the petition was intended to cover plain bearingsother than spherical plain bearings. Additionally, petitioner's most recent submissions regarding the scopeof the investigations also indicate that the types of plain bearings ofprimary concern are spherical plain bearings and rod ends. Petitioner'sletter to the Department of February 24, 1989, reiterates that the products``specifically intended to be covered by the investigation include: (1)All spherical plain bearings and parts thereof (regardless of whether housingsor mountings are involved); (2) all rod ends (or rod end bearings)(whetherplain or other); and (3) lined bearings/bushings (`metal on metal')'' (Withrespect to lined bearings/bushings, it is not clear from information currentlyavailable to us the kind of bearings to which petitioner is referring.)Petitioner's Posthearing Brief on Issues of General Application explicitlystates that ``[a]t the threshold, bearings names [sic] in the petitionmust be included in the investigations (<T3>e.g., </T3>aerospace bearings, rod ends, <T3>spherical plain bearings, </T3>etc.).'' (emphasis added). Furthermore,petitioner has stated that certain other types of plain bearings are notof concern and that it ``does not object to the exclusion'' of ``oil filmplain bearings (whether bi- or tri-metallic)'' from the scope of the investigations.(Petitioner's Written Submission at 3, February 24, 1989.) We have carefully examined the petition, the accompanying exhibits, clarificationsby the petitioner, all of the arguments and submissions filed by petitionerand interested parties, Department research and memoranda, and the ITCstaff report. Based on this examination, we have found that the other plainbearings cited by petitioner and other interested parties are substantiallydifferent from spherical plain bearings. Because of these differences,it is reasonable to conclude that had the petitioner intended to coverplain bearings other than spherical plain bearings, it would have specificallylisted such bearings in the petition. Accordingly, such plain bearingscould not reasonably be found to be within the scope of these investigations.Spherical plain bearings have matched, spherically-shaped inner and outerrings which slide in relation to each other. By contrast, other plain bearings,such as sleeve bearings, journals, and plain bushings, are cylindrically-shaped(or semi-circular) and are composed of a single surface on which a shaftrests. Spherical plain bearings are self-aligning and are generally manufacturedfrom bearing-grade steel (<T3>i.e. </T3>SAE 52100). By contrast, other plain bearings are not self-aligningand are not manufactured from SAE 52100 steel. Spherical plain bearingspermit movement under moderate to high loads and allow for shaft misalignment.They generally function like an elbow joint in translating <T3>oscillatory or realignment motion, as opposed to rotating motion. </T3>Bycontrast, other types of plain bearings generally function on shafts, <T3>rotating </T3>at moderate to high speeds with little, if any, allowancefor misalignment. Finally, based on a careful examination of the products themselves, aswell as on the documents noted above (<T3>e.g., </T3>comments, Department research), we have found that plainbearings, other than spherical plain bearings and rod ends, are much moresimilar to oil-film plain bearings, products expressly excluded by thepetitioner, than to spherical plain bearings, products expressly coveredby the petition. This finding further confirms our conclusion that thepetition did not intend to cover plain bearings other than spherical plainbearings.We disagree with petitioner's contention that the petition covers all plainbearings of a type similar to those it produces. The Department cannotaccept such a broad interpretation of the scope of a petition. Our regulationsrequire that a CVD or AD petition contain a ``detailed description of theimported merchandise in question, including its technical characteristicsand uses, and, where appropriate, its tariff classification * * *.'' (19CFR 355.26(4) and 353.36(4).) We have determined that the petition expresslyincluded spherical plain bearings and did not include other types of plainbearings, a conclusion supported by the substantial differences betweenthe products. Whether petitioner manufactures any plain bearings otherthan spherical plain bearings is not determinative. Petitioner's argument,if allowed to stand, would permit other petitioners to define the scopeof our investigations based on the products they produce, whether or notsuch products are generally or specifically identified in the petition.It should be noted that the Department's July 13, 1988, decision memoranduminadvertently refers to ``plain bearings,'' although the discussion thereindescribes the physical attributes and characteristics of spherical plainbearings, as opposed to other types of plain bearings. The inadvertentuse of the term ``plain bearings,'' rather than ``spherical plain bearings,''continued in the Department's questionnaires and in our preliminary CVDand AD determinations. Similarly, the ITC preliminary determinations listed ``plain bearings,''rather than spherical plain bearings, as one of its six like products.However, the staff report accompanying those determinations specificallyreferred to and described spherical plain bearings only. In addition, theITC, believing that only spherical plain bearings were covered by the investigations,limited its preliminary questionnaires, data collection, and injury analysisto the U.S. spherical plain bearing industry, as it did not solicit, receive,or examine data on plain bearings other than spherical plain bearings.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Petitioner contends that, despite arguments of someinterested parties to the contrary, the petition covers all rod ends (rod-endbearings, whether plain or other) and all spherical plain bearings andparts thereof (regardless of whether housings or mountings are involved).Petitioner included in the petition plain bearings of the type describedby Minebea, and petitioner produces each of these types of bearings. Petitionerfurther contends, contrary to Minebea's assertion, that plain bearingsminimize friction between moving parts. Although plain bearings and rodends have higher coefficients of friction than bearings with separate rollingelements, plain bearings and rod ends are designed and manufactured inaccordance with industry and government standards which specify materialhardness and break-away torque. The purpose of these requirements is toensure surface finish and to reduce wear in order to minimize friction.Any sacrifice in the friction-reducing properties of plain bearings isoffset by the high load-carrying capability as compared to other typesof antifriction bearings of a similar dimension.  Minebea contends that rod ends without a rolling element, spherical plainbearings, and bushings (otherwise referred to as journals or sleeves) falloutside the scope of these investigations since these bearings are notantifriction bearings, but rather high friction bearings. Minebea contendsthat ball and roller bearings are antifriction bearings, because the rollingelement significantly reduces friction between two moving parts. The principalfunction of ball and roller bearings is to reduce friction to the lowestpractical level. Ball and roller antifriction bearings have very low coefficientsof friction, ranging from .0008 to .0012 and .002 to .004, respectively.In contrast, high friction bearings have very high coefficents of friction,ranging from .03 to .5, respectively. Plain bearings lacking a rollingelement generate substantially higher friction levels than antifrictionbearings. For this reason, such plain bearings are referred to as highfriction bearings and their interchangeability with antifriction bearingsis limited. Similarily, Nippon Thompson Co., Ltd. (``Nippon Thompson''), and IKO International,Inc. (``IKO'') contend that rod-end bearings and spherical plain bearingsare not antifriction bearings and, therefore, should be excluded from thescope of the investigations. Nippon Thompson and IKO base their contentionson the following points: (1) The petition does not specifically list rodends; (2) both rod ends and spherical plain bearings differ from antifrictionbearings in terms of general physical characteristics, ultimate uses, expectationsof the ultimate purchaser, channels of trade, advertising and display,and the production processes utilized.Specifically, Nippon Thompson and IKO argue that rod-end bearings and sphericalplain bearings, unlike antifriction bearings, do not contain rolling elements;rather, they contain sliding elements that permit oscillating movement.Since the function of these bearings is not to reduce friction, and sincesuch bearings contain no rolling elements, they have much higher frictionlevels than those of antifriction bearings. Spherical plain bearings aretypically employed in applications requiring a heavy duty controlling andlinking mechanism, such as construction equipment. Such bearings are designedto withstand particularly heavy radial and axial loads. Rod ends are similarlyused as a linking or controlling mechanism in applications where spaceand weight pose significant problems. Examples of such applications includethe controlling mechanisms in textile machinery, aircrafts and spacecrafts,farm equipment, packaging machinery, industrial robots, and other likemechanisms. No antifriction bearing can perform such functions; therefore,spherical plain bearings and rod end bearings are not interchangeable withantifriction bearings. The ultimate users choose spherical plain bearings and rod end bearingswhere a particularly heavy duty linking or controlling mechanism, requiringalmost no rotation, is involved. Such users would not look to antifrictionbearings for such a use. Spherical plain bearings are sold directly toOEM customers and to distributors who are different from those distributorswhich sell antifriction bearings. The majority of rod end sales are madeto distributors that handle power transmission products rather than antifrictionsbearings. Moreover, advertising catalogues are prepared for antifrictionbearings and spherical plain bearings/rod ends. The manufacture of spherical plain bearings involves a separate productionline at a separate facility from those used for the production of antifrictionbearings. The shifting of production from spherical plain bearings to antifrictionbearings, or <T3>vice versa </T3>is not feasible and therefore is not done. In contrastto the production process used to manufacture antifriction bearings, thatused to manufacture spherical plain bearings involves a press machine,a hydraulic press, and swaging dies. Similarly, the manufacture of rodends involves a separate production line at a separate facility from thoseused for the production of either antifriction bearings or spherical plainbearings. The production of rod ends, therefore, cannot be shifted to theproduction lines for either antifriction bearings or spherical plain bearings.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>As discussed in the previous position, the Departmenthas determined that spherical plain bearings and rod-end bearings are withinthe scope of these investigations. (To the extent that any of the ``journals''or ``bushings'' referred to by Minebea constitute a type of plain bearingother than a spherical plain bearing, we have excluded such products fromthe scope of these investigations. <T3>See also </T3>our discussion of spherical plain bearings and plainbearings other than spherical plain, above.) Rod-end bearings, whether of the spherical plain or rolling element type,are also included in these investigations as they were specifically namedin the petition. See Petition at Exhibit 4. These bearings are classifiedaccording to their rolling element geometry, (or the sliding contact geometryin the case of spherical plain rod ends). The Department's June 13, 1988product coverage memorandum explicitly states that rod end bearings, withoutqualification, are subject to these investigations. Therefore, rod endbearings with or without a rolling element are within the scope of theseinvestigations. We disagree with the contention advanced by several interested partiesthat the products listed above should be excluded from the scope of theseinvestigations, because the coefficients of friction of such products arehigher than those of rolling element bearings. We find no evidence thatthe petition or any exhibit thereto expressly or implicitly limits thescope of the investigations on the basis of coefficients of friction. While it might be argued that some of the products under investigationmay not normally be referred to as an ``antifriction bearing,'' such considerationsare not determinative for purposes of establishing the scope of these investigations.Spherical plain bearings, including rod ends, were expressly identifiedin the petition and we have determined that they constitute a separateclass or kind of merchandise. Rod ends are simply bearings which are enclosed in a threaded housing ofa specific, generally recognized shape.<T3>Comment 3. </T3>Petitioner contends that there is no basis for SKF-France'sattempt to differentiate an entire class of bearings on the basis of productapplication because the petition at page 14 specifically identifies ``aviationand aerospace'' applications as an illustration of the many applicationsof antifriction bearings covered by the investigations. Petitioner also contends that the arguments advanced by SKF and Minebeathat rod end bearings are airframe or fuselage components unrelated tothe reduction of friction are without merit. Petitioner argues that theDepartment's June 13, 1988, product coverage decision memorandum explicitlystates that rod ends are included within the scope of the investigations.Rod end bearings are ``true bearings'' and, accordingly, are not airframecomponents unrelated to the reduction of friction (<T3>e.g., </T3>avionics equipment or fuselage components), which have beenexcluded from these investigations. SKF-France contends that airframe components and parts thereof are a separateclass or kind of merchandise and, therefore, should not be included withinthe scope of the investigations. SKF further contends, in the alternative,that the Department should determine that aircraft components_other thanthe airframe components already specifically excluded by the Department_area distinct class or kind of merchandise for which separate antidumpingduty margins should be calculated.SKF-France argues that airframe components include rod ends, links, andspecial parts, such as struts, cable tension regulators, and fly-by-wirecontrols, which provide stability to the aircraft or act as a control deviceover certain parts of an airplane. SKF-France contends that aircraft componentshave physical characteristics that are different from those of the bearingssubject to these investigations, are produced and sold through separatechannels of trade, satisfy unique customer expectations and needs, andare advertised and displayed in a manner different from that for antifrictionbearings. Specifically, aircraft components are specialized products manufacturedin accordance with specialized and detailed aerospace standards, as wellas strict qualification procedures. In contrast to the five classes orkinds of merchandise subject to these investigations, airframe componentsare subject to a hydrogen embrittlement process, vigorous quality controlprocedures, and specialized heat testing procedures. Even the grease usedfor aircraft components differs from that used in a standard commercialbearing. Thus, aircraft components are not interchangeable or competitivewith the antifriction bearings subject to the investigations. SKF-France also contends that the Department should define the classesor kinds of bearings subject to these investigations according to theirend use, because both the industry and the workplace recognize differentend uses for such products. Aircraft components are specially designedand are used to serve as parts in the aircraft. Fly-by-wire controls areused to convert mechanical movement into electrical impulses in electronicflight control systems; struts support the floors of the aircraft and cabletension regulators are used for aircraft control cables. Minebea and Rose contend that even assuming the term ``antifriction bearing''is a misnomer for bearings, there is ample evidence on the record indicatingthat the majority of Minebea's and Rose's U.S. exports of rod ends withoutrolling elements, spherical plain bearings, and bushings (otherwise knownas journal bearings or sleeves) are airframe and fuselage components unrelatedto the reduction of friction. Because the Department's July 13, 1988, classor kind decision memorandum already excluded such products from the scopeof these investigations, the Department should not include such productswithin the scope of the final determinations. These products are control linkages or flexible joints which are used toaccept misalignment or minimize stress on the airframe or fuselage structureand prevent structure failures. Airframe components used in the primaryflight control surfaces (wing flaps, leading edge slats, elevator controls)are used to absorb the deflections and loads associated with takeoff, landing,and flight. These airframe components do not function in a continuous rotationalmode like a rolling element antifriction bearing. These products enterunder TSUSA numbers other than the TSUSA number 681.3400 listed in AppendixV of the Department's questionnaire. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We determine that all AFBs (including rod ends andother spherical plain bearings) used in aviation applications are coveredby the scope of these investigations. However, we have excluded from thescope of investigation airframe components that are unrelated to the reductionof friction. As discussed above in the general class or kind section, theDepartment has not distinguished between size, precision and applicationfor the purposes of its class or kind determination. The petition at page 14 specifically mentions ``aviation'' applicationsas being among the uses and applications of the antifriction bearings coveredby these investigations. Exhibit 4 to the petition specifically lists ``AircraftControl'' bearings. Furthermore, the express language of the petition andexhibits thereto covers spherical plain bearings and rod ends. (<T3>See also </T3>comments and responses above.) The Department's June13, 1988, product coverage decision memorandum similarly states that ``[r]odends and rod end bearings, which some parties have referred to as aircraftcomponents, <T3>are </T3>subject to these investigations.'' (emphasis supplied in original).This same memorandum also states that only ``[a]irframe components whichare obviously unrelated to the reduction of friction (<T3>e.g., </T3>avionics equipment or fuselage components) are <T3>not </T3>subject to these investigations.'' (emphasis supplied in original).We have insufficient information to determine whether specific items vaguelyreferred to as ``aircraft components'' or ``airframe components'' are outsidethe scope of these investigations or constitute one or more separate classesor kinds of merchandise. An important factor in our determination is thevagueness of the terminology used by some of the parties. The phrases ``aircraftcomponents'' and ``airframe components'' are subject to extremely variedinterpretations. Accordingly, the Department is unable to be more specificin its response. However, it should be clear that any of the subject bearings,regardless of whether they may ultimately be utilized on aircraft, automobiles,or other equipment, are in fact within the scope of these investigations.It should also be clear that tariff classification numbers are <T3>not </T3>determinative of the products under investigation. <T3>Diversified Products Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>572 F. Supp. 883, 887-88 (CIT 1983). The writtendescription of the scope of investigation defines the products under investigation.<T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner contends that, contrary to the assertionsof several interested parties, high-precision, aerospace bearings are exactlylike ``commodity'' bearings in terms of function and manufacture and, therefore,should not be excluded from the scope of the investigations. To divideantifriction bearings into various classes or kinds based upon end uses,rather than on inherent characteristics of such bearings, would open aPandora's box. Petitioner further contends that there is no basis for the exclusion ofaerospace engine bearings for the following reasons: (1) Petitioner manufacturesthe aerospace engine bearings illustrated in BIG-AIA's pre-hearing brief;(2) these bearings are antifriction bearings; hence, they are not uniqueand distinct from the other bearings included in the investigations; (3)the materials used to manufacture aerospace engine bearings (<T3>e.g.,</T3> M50 steel and silver lined cages) are not unique to thosebearings; (4) the production facilities used to manufacture aerospace bearingsare not unique to those bearings; that is, petitioner and other U.S. domesticproducers of antifriction bearings can and have produced aerospace bearingsin the same plants that manufacture bearings for less ``exotic'' applications;(5) warranties and guarantees, as well as special certification and testingrequirements, for aerospace bearings are likewise not different from theguarantees assumed by the petitioner on various other bearings; (6) hightemperature and heavy load requirements are not unique to aerospace bearings.For example, the temperature in an automobile engine may equal or exceedthat at the front end of an aircraft engine; and (7) it is not unique thataerospace bearings are specially ordered; petitioner, as well as otherU.S. domestic manufacturers of antifriction bearings, produces by specialorder many products that are not advertised or included in its catalogues.Petitioner also contends that the Department should deny the requests ofSKF and FAG-FRG to establish a new class or kind of merchandise for aerospacebearings and, accordingly, to calculate a separate antidumping duty marginfor such bearings. Petitioner argues that SKF has not explained whetherall high precision bearings would constitute a single class or kind ofmerchandise, or whether such bearings should be broken down into the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise already identified by the Department. Theverification reports reveal that FAG-FRG was unable to supply conclusiveevidence that such bearings represent a separate and distinct class orkind of merchandise. Nowhere in any of the verification reports is therea specific discussion concerning the length of the qualification process,the use of more advanced technologies, use of stricter quality controlprocedures, use of different channels of trade, and the different ultimateexpectations of the end users. BIG-AIA and FAG-FRG contend that the Department should exclude aerospaceengine, ball, cylindrical, and spherical roller bearings from the scopeof investigation. BIG-AIA and FAG-FRG also contend, as an alternative tothe exclusion of aerospace bearings from the scope of investigations, thatthe Department should find that these products constitute a separate classor kind of merchandise. Accordingly, the Department should calculate aseparate antidumping duty margin for such products. BIG-AIA advances two arguments to support the exclusion of aerospace enginebearings from the scope of the investigations. First, the petition makesno specific reference to custom-made aerospace engine bearings; instead,the petition covers only commodity bearings. Second, aerospace engine bearingsdiffer from antifriction bearings in terms of physical characteristics,ultimate uses, expectations of the ultimate purchaser, channels of tradeand distribution, and the manner in which the product is displayed andadvertised. BIG-AIA argues that aerospace engine bearings are custom-made rather thanstandardized as commodity bearings are, are produced from M50 and M50 NILsteel, and have cadmium-plated surfaces. Almost all other bearings aremanufactured from standard SAE 52100 steel, a less expensive and lowergrade alloy. The design of an aerospace bearing contains much greater detailthan that of a commodity bearing; aerospace engine bearings are manufacturedat production facilities and by workers separate from those utilized tomanufacture standardized commodity bearings; the technologies used to manufactureaerospace engine and commodity bearings differ. Aerospace bearings commanda higher selling price than commodity bearings, because aerospace bearingsare one hundred times more expensive to produce than commodity bearings.SKF contends that aerospace engine bearings are subject to extremely strictquality control and qualification procedures. SKF further contends thatnone of the TSUS numbers under which aircraft ball bearings enter the UnitedStates is listed as being subject to the investigations. BIG-AIA, FAG-FRG, and SKF contend that such bearings have unique applications.These bearings are used exclusively in missiles, spacecraft, and aircraft(fixed wing and rotary wing), as well as in main propulsion engines (<T3>e.g.,</T3> aerospace engines), auxiliary aircraft power units, gearboxes, and instruments. As such, these bearings are not interchangeableand competitive with standardized antifriction bearings. BIG-AIA furthercontends that such bearings must be able to withstand operating temperaturesuncommon to those at which commodity bearings must operate, are subjectto aerodynamic loads different from those of commodity bearings, must beable to perform at all altitudes, and must comply with the safety standardspromulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Customer expectations are, therefore, unique; that is, aerospace enginemanufacturers, rather than the bearings manufacturers, design the bearingsto be utilized in their engines. These bearings also carry special warrantyand guarantee programs. Aerospace engine bearings are sold and distributedonly to the specific engine manufacturer that designed and ordered suchbearings; as a result, such bearings cannot be purchased ``off the shelf.''Because aerospace engine bearings are custom designed, advertising forsuch products consists of name recognition and product capability information,rather than catalogue information. Finally, FAG-FRG contends that according to the analysis developed by theDepartment's Office of Industrial Resource Administration (``OIRA''), super-precisionball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings, the two types of bearingsprimarily used in aerospace engine applications, constitute separate anddiscrete product categories. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We determine that aerospace engine bearings arewithin the scope of these investigations and have not treated them as aseparate class or kind of merchandise. As discussed above in the generalclass or kind section, the Department did not distinguish between size,precision and application in making its class or kind determination. Contrary to the arguments of BIG-AIA, the petition specifically lists ``aviationand aerospace'' and ``aircraft engines'' as illustrations of the uses ofantifriction bearings covered by these investigations. (See Petition at14, 17). The essence of the argument advanced by BIG-AIA and FAG-FRG is that theDepartment should exclude aerospace engine bearings from the scope of theseinvestigations based on the end use of such bearings_that is, their finalapplication in aircraft engines. As noted above, the petition and exhibitsthereto already cover such applications.Additionally, to accept the argument that aircraft engine bearings area separate class or kind would require the Department to reach an unreasonableconclusion_<T3>i.e.,</T3> that for each specific application in which a particularbearing may be used, a separate class or kind of merchandise would be determinedto exist. That material content, quality, design, precision, or degree of engineeringcontrol may differ is typical of the subject merchandise since bearingsare used in an enormous variety of specialized final applications. However,these products all provide and have in common the functional capabilitiesof the bearings under investigation. BIG-AIA and FAG-FRG would have the Department determine that two ball bearingswith similar dimensions and design constitute two separate classes or kindsof merchandise when one of those bearings is designated as an ``aerospacebearing,'' and the other is designated as a ``standard bearing'' and usedin an automobile. Conversely, these interested parties would have the Departmentdetermine that a cylindrical roller bearing and a ball bearing are similarand, thus, fall within the same class or kind of merchandise when bothbearings are designated as ``aerospace bearings.'' While there may be discernibledifferences between aerospace engine bearings and other bearings, the analysisproposed by the interested parties would elevate the final end use of abearing as the sole distinguishing factor among all bearings, thereby ignoringimportant differences between the types of bearings in its proposed classor kind of merchandise. As discussed above in the comments on class orkind, the functional capabilities of a bearing are determined by the shapeof the rolling element (and the shape of the contact surfaces in the caseof spherical plain bearings). We also disagree with the contention advanced by FAG-FRG that, becauseOIR found that super-precision ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings,the two types of bearings primarily used in aerospace engine applications,constitute separate product categories, the Department is somehow boundby that finding. OIRA made its finding in the context of an investigationundertaken pursuant to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.(19 U.S.C. section l862(h)). Although OIRA's finding may be instructivein the context of the Department's antidumping investigation, it is importantto note that the objectives of the two investigations are significantlydifferent. Investigations undertaken pursuant to section 232 seek to ascertainthe production levels of an industry important to the national securityof the United States to determine whether import relief is warranted; bycontrast, those investigations undertaken pursuant to sections 701 and731 of the Act seek to identify and offset injurious subdization and dumpingpractices, respectively. Because the objectives of the two investigationsare different, the Department is not bound by a finding made by a differentdepartmental organization that administers a different statute. <T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioner contends that bearings are made accordingto a wide spectrum of precision grades. When a high grade bearing is required,a lower grade one cannot be substituted. This, however, does not warrantclass or kind distinctions on the basis of precision grade. High precisionbearings are exactly like ``commodity'' bearings, except that they areengineered and produced to more precise tolerances. In function and manufacture,however, they are essentially identical. Petitioner notes that a divisionbetween precision and non-precision bearings could require the carvingout of many additional classes or kinds of merchandise. SKF argues that high precision bearings, those with ABEC and RBEC precisionratings of 7-9, constitute a separate class or kind of merchandise. Ordinarybearings are not interchangeable with high precision bearings inasmuchas the latter are manufactured to higher standards and more demanding specifications,using different raw materials. High precision bearings are used in differentapplications and are marketed through different channels of trade to adifferent class of customers at very high prices. A user of imported high precision ball bearings, the Precise Corporation,has submitted an exclusion request for high precision ball bearings (ABEC7 and 9 with inner diameter less than or equal to 40mm). <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Bearing precision is an application-specific requirementthat we do not consider to be a sufficient basis for establishing a separateclass or kind of merchandise in these investigations. See our discussionabove in the general class or kind section. Although a high precision bearingmay, in some sense, be a ``better'' bearing, it is a qualitative variationthat could apply to any one of the five categories under investigation.Further, the functional characteristics are essentially the same as lowerprecision bearings of the same rolling element type. (<T3>See also</T3> our discussion of class or kind above.) The request of Precision Corporation is based on economic considerationsthat are beyond the scope of our analysis. <T3>Comment 6_Linear Motion Devices.</T3> Petitioner contends that, contraryto the allegations of several interested parties, linear motion bearingsand linear motion guides (for purposes of this discussion collectivelyreferred to as linear motion devices or LMDs) are included within the scopeof these investigations. Petitioner argues that the characteristic of facilitatinglinear motion does not make LMDs something other than antifriction bearingsand that LMDs were always within the scope of these investigations. Petitioneralso argues that it produces LMDs, even though there is no requirementthat a petitioner manufacture every product that is subject to investigation.In addition, petitioner contends that Thomson Industries Inc., a domesticproducer of LMDs, fully supports the petition. Deutsche Star GmbH, SKF, THK, INA France, Nippon Thompson, and NSK individuallyargue that LMDs are not within the scope of these investigations. Theseinterested parties offer several arguments in support of this assertion.Many interested parties contend that LMDs do not fall within any of theclasses or kinds of merchandise defined by the Department for the purposesof these investigations and that LMDs constitute a separate class or kindof merchandise. Several interested parties state that LMDs are not antifrictionbearings as they differ substantially from the subject bearings in termsof function and design. Certain interested parties contend that it is improperto categorize LMDs as antifriction bearings based solely on the type ofrolling element employed within the device. Many interested parties provideextensive analysis of the differences between LMDs and antifriction bearingsbased on the criteria established in <T3>Diversified Products Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 6 CIT 155 at 162, 572 F. Supp. 883 (1983). Certaininterested parties argue that the petition lacks any mention of LMDs andthat petitioner has sought to include LMDs retroactively. Certain interestedparties submit that the Department should note the ITC's observation thatLMDs are products which do not appear to be bearings. Furthermore, interestedparties argue, LMDs are a separate class or kind of merchandise which mustbe excluded from the scope of these investigations as petitioner has failedto provide the Department with a reasonable basis for inclusion. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> While petitioner and interested parties provideseveral arguments with respect to the inclusion or exclusion of LMDs fromthe scope of these investigations, we believe the description and definitionof the subject merchandise covered by the petition to be the primary basison which to determine whether LMDs are within the scope of these investigations.Based on the following analysis, we have excluded LMDs from the scope ofthese investigations.The petition is silent with respect to LMDs. The petition expressly identifiesthe following products as included within the scope of these investigations:<ITAG tagnum="21">Ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, spherical roller bearings,spherical plain bearings, needle roller bearings, thrust bearings, tappetbearings, and all mounted bearings such as set screw housed units, bushings,pillow block units, flange, cartridge and take-up units and parts includingballs, rollers, cages or retainers, cups, shields and seals. (Petition,page 13)</ITAG>The petition clearly specifies certain products as covered by the investigationswhich otherwise might not generally be understood to be encompassed bythe phrase ``antifriction bearings.'' Petitioner provides specific referenceto housed units and pillow block units as merchandise covered by the petition.Although petitioner adds that ``[t]his petition covers <T3>all </T3>types of bearings and parts, except tapered roller bearings,regardless of whether they are depicted in Exhibit 3 or listed in Exhibit4 [of the petition], and regardless of whether the foreign producers usedifferent designations for the products,'' (Petition, page 16) the citedexhibits (which include petitioner's product lists) do not mention linearmotion bearings or linear motion guides. Furthermore, we have determined that LMDs are substantially different fromantifriction bearings, as described in the petition. For example, LMDsdo not contain the four basic components cited in the petition that mostantifriction bearings contain: ``outer ring or outer race, inner ring orinner race, a series of balls or roller elements which fit into openingsin the separator or cage, and a separator or cage which keeps the ballsor rollers equally distributed around the races.'' (Petition, page 15)Linear motion guides (LMGs) generally consist of a mounting block to whichthe load is attached and rectangular rails on which the block rides. LMGscontain circulating balls (some use rollers) between the block and therails to ensure smooth continuous motion necessary for repeated accuratepositioning along a linear track. Examples of LMG applications are laserprocessing, machine tool equipment and photocopier equipment. Linear motionbearings (LMBs) generally consist of a shell that encloses a reciprocatingshaft. LMBs contain recirculating balls riding on the inside of the shellto ensure proper alignment and smooth precise movement of the shaft. Forexample, LMBs are used in the operation of hydraulic dye presses whereit is crucial that the press come straight down on the same spot everytime. The primary function of LMBs is to facilitate precise linear movement andthat of LMGs is to facilitate precise linear positioning. The subject antifrictionbearings, on the other hand, generally reduce friction and support a rotatingload. Antifriction bearings do not facilitate the linear movement or linearpositioning of a load. Thus, LMDs and the merchandise described in thepetition are distinct products with fundamentally different functions.It cannot be assumed, therefore, that the petition was intended to includeeither linear motion guides or linear motion bearings in the scope of theseinvestigations. Accordingly, we have determined that the linear motion guides and linearmotion bearings described above, and dedicated parts thereof, are not subjectto these investigations. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Petitioner contends that there is no basis for excludingsplit cylindrical roller bearings since these products are split simplyto facilitate installation. Cooper Bearings contends that its split cylindrical roller bearing is adifferent class or kind of merchandise from the products included in theseinvestigations and, as such, should be excluded from the investigations'scope. Cooper Bearings argues that its products are unlike any other bearingin these investigations in that they are manufactured to yield halved componentswhich are assembled around a shaft, rather than slid onto the end of theshaft as in standard bearings. Cooper Bearings argues that, unlike standardbearings, its products are sold primarily to the replacement market inlow volumes at high prices. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with petitioner. The petition stated thatit covered ``<T3>[a]ll </T3>types of antifriction bearings, other than tapered rollerbearings'' (emphasis added). It is uncontroverted that split cylindricalroller bearings are antifriction bearings. These bearings contain the fouressential elements which petitioner describes as typifying ball and rollerbearings: Inner race, outer race, rolling elements, and separator or cage.(Petition at page 15.) Although Cooper emphasizes the advantages of itssplit cylindrical roller bearing in its mounting, it is clear that, oncefixed onto a shaft, the split bearing operates no differently from morestandard bearing designs. While the Department does not challenge Cooper's claim that split cylindricalroller bearings have a special design aimed for the aftermarket, the intendedapplication does not change the nature of the product itself, namely, thatit is a cylindrical roller bearing. (<T3>See </T3>comment above regarding aerospace bearings.) The vast arrayof possible bearing end use applications has led to a wide variety of designs,sizes, and specifications that can be viewed as engineering and designvariants of a common theme. As such, the Department concludes that splitcylindrical roller bearings are properly included within the scope of theseinvestigations and properly fall within the cylindrical roller bearingclass or kind. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner contends that wheel hub units are properlyincluded within the scope of these investigations, since these items aresimply mounted or packaged bearings. Petitioner also argues that the petitionexpressly names wheel hub units as a product under investigation. The SKF companies and NSK contend that wheel hub units should be excludedfrom these investigations because they are more than an antifriction bearing.NTN contends that wheel hub units are not the same class or kind of merchandiseas the bearings under investigation. In addition, all three companies applythe five <T3>Diversified Products </T3>criteria in support of their arguments. Respondentsalso cite a July 1983 Customs Service ruling which states that generations2 and 3 wheel hub units ``demonstrate functions which are in excess ofthose normally associated with ball or roller bearings.'' <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We determine that wheel hub units (generations 1,2, and 3) are properly within the classes or kinds of merchandise subjectto these investigations. The petition expressly included wheel hub units without limitation as togeneration. Wheel hub unit generation 1 is essentially a double-row ballbearing. (Generation l may also contain two rows of tapered rollers butsuch units are not within the scope of these investigations.) The racesof wheel hub unit generations 2 and 3 have been expanded, flanged, drilled,and/or splined. Wheel hub unit generation 1 is clearly within the scope of investigationand no parties have sought their exclusion. With respect to generations2 and 3, we find that they are simply bearings modified in ways similarto other bearings which have flanged or otherwise enhanced parts containingraceways. While wheel hub units may have features which allow them to serveadditional functions such as facilitating mounting, they retain their essentialbearing function. The additional features found on wheel hub units aresimply engineering and design variations which do not alter the fundamentalnature of the product as a bearing.With respect to the Customs ruling, we note that such rulings are not determinativeof the issue of which products are covered by an antidumping or countervailingduty petition, investigation or order. In addition, that ruling describesthe items in question as ``ball bearings'' and notes that the company literatureprovided to the Customs Service refers to the wheel hub units as ``bearingunits.'' <T3>Comment 9.</T3> Petitioner contends that, contrary to SKF's assertion,miniature/very small bearings and large-size bearings should not be consideredseparate classes or kinds of merchandise. Petitioner argues that, whiledifferent machines may be used to produce different size bearings, thelength of the production run is as much a determinant of the machineryused as the size of the bearing. Machines with greater flexibility tendto be used for short production runs and dedicated machines for long productionruns. Similarly, different equipment is used for different size bearings.Petitioner also argues that a single facility can produce a variety ofbearing sizes and cites a 1968 Koyo catalogue which refers to Koyo's Takamatsuplant as producing miniature and instrument bearings, medium size ballbearings and power transmission bearings. Petitioner believes that neithersize nor special application is a sufficient justification for distinguishinga class or kind of merchandise since all antifriction bearings possessthe same general physical characteristics and perform the same generalfunction. SKF contends that miniature and very small-size bearings (<T3>i.e.,</T3> outside diameter less than 30mm) and large-size bearings(<T3>i.e.,</T3> outside diameter in excess of 420mm) each constitute a separateclass or kind of merchandise. SKF argues that the miniature and very small-sizebearings are physically different from ordinary and large-size bearings,are produced for specialized applications, and are sold through differentdistribution channels. In fact, in the United States, miniature bearingsales are handled by SKF Specialty Bearings, not by the SKF Bearing Industries/BearingServices network that handles sales of ordinary bearings. Moreover, separatefacilities and different production processes and equipment are used. Microscopesand ``white rooms'' are required. SKF offers similar arguments for separatingout large-size bearings, maintaining that they are custom made in specialfacilities and are used in special applications. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree with respondent. As discussed abovein the general class or kind discussion, the Department has not distinguishedbetween size, precision and application for the purposes of our class orkind decision. Each of the five classes or kinds under investigation ismade in a wide range of sizes, which makes size a qualitative rather thana class or kind distinction. The mere existence of dimensional differenceswithin product classes does not detract from the fact that all bearingswithin each class share the same general physical and functional characteristicsas well as differences relative to the other classes. (<T3>See</T3> ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this Appendix.)<T3>Comment 10.</T3> One respondent, SKF-FRG, argues that slewing ringsare so substantially different in physical characteristics, use and customerexpectations that they should be excluded from the scope of the investigations.SKF-FRG asserts that not only are slewing rings extremely large, they aredesigned generally to move in less than a 90 degree arc rather than toreduce friction between moving and fixed parts through rotation. Another respondent, FAG-FRG, claims that petitioner's characterizationof slewing rings as ``large diameter ball bearings with gears cut in thecup'' is disingenuous and misleading. FAG-FRG alleges that slewing ringsare large, custom-made devices which, unlike a standard bearing, are anintegral part of a machine. While FAG-FRG concedes that slewing rings mayin some cases have balls or rollers, as well as gears, in other instancesthey lack these characteristics. A third interested party, Rothe Erde Schmiedag AG (RES), points to theDepartment's June 13, 1988, scope memorandum in support of its contentionthat the Department explicitly excluded slewing rings at an early stageof the investigations. RES agrees with that decision, arguing that neitherslewing rings nor their separate, machinery part tariff classificationswere referenced in the petition. RES, like SKF-FRG, does not believe thatpetitioner is a producer of the product. Moreover, RES stresses that theexclusion of slewing rings is justified on the basis of different physicalcharacteristics, distribution patterns, uses and costs.RES adds that a reversal of the Department's exclusion decision would beunfair and deny RES its due process rights. If slewing rings were intendedto be included, the Department should have solicited information on theproduct, particularly as it differs so much from other products investigated.The Department solicited no such information, and there is no informationon the record concerning sales of slewing rings. RES consequently has reliedon the Department's actions and assurances that slewing rings are not includedin the investigations. Petitioner asserts that the petition covers a variety of bearing products,including slewing rings, and that it is a manufacturer of slewing rings.Petitioner characterizes slewing rings as basically bearings with gearteeth on the inner or outer rings (or both). Petitioner therefore believes that the Department's June 13 memorandumimproperly excluded slewing rings, particularly as the Department virtuallyignored the fact that slewing ``bearings'' have physical characteristics,uses and channels of distribution identical to the other bearings underinvestigation. Petitioner states that slewing rings may be either plain,ball or roller bearings, but in all instances the physical characteristicthat predominates is the presence of an inner ring and an outer ring. Arguingthat case law and ITA precedent establish that the predominant functionof an article identifies whether it should be in the class or kind of merchandisecovered by an order (<T3>see, e.g., Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, from Japan,</T3>52 FR 8942 (1987)), petitioner contends that the addition of a gearon the inner or outer race of a slewing ring does not change the primarypurpose of the bearing_<T3>i.e., </T3>to permit motion while supporting a load. Petitioner points to SKF's submission of June 13, 1988, to support itscontention that the use and market for slewing rings are no different fromthose for other antifriction bearings. SKF's statements that ``[s]lewingrings * * * are large-sized bearings specifically designed to accommodateoscillating movements,'' and that they ``permit rotation of the mobilesection of an assembly and accommodate tilting movements as well as axialand radial loads'' are cited by petitioner as evidence that slewing rings,and cylindrical or spherical thrust bearings share the same applications.The use of slewing rings on construction machinery, hoisting and mechanicalhandling equipment and in the steel industry are, in petitioner's estimation,all applications and markets typical of antifriction bearings in general.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>Following careful consideration of the informationand arguments presented by all parties, the Department has concluded thatslewing rings and slewing bearings (slewing rings) are within the scopeof the investigations. Although petitioner did not specifically refer to slewing rings in thepetition, Torrington's May 26, 1988 submission points out that ``[t]hepetition also covers bearing products referred to by one or more respondentsas * * * slewing rings.'' Furthermore, the Department notes, like petitioner,that arguments and information presented by both FAG-FRG and SKF-FRG referspecifically to slewing rings as ``bearings.'' Moreover, it appears thatpetitioner intended to include slewing rings in the scope of these investigationssince they possess inner rings, outer rings, and rolling elements, thebroad general physical characteristics utilized by petitioner in characterizingthe merchandise under investigation. Respondents rely heavily on the fact that slewing rings tend to be custom-madefor specialized applications, however, the same argument can be made fora number of other products which the Department has determined are properlywithin the scope of these investigations. (<T3>See </T3>comments and DOC positions with respect to high precisionand large-size bearings). Respondents have also suggested that the customary feature of gear teethon a slewing ring causes the product to have two chief functional characteristics,and consequently renders it more than a bearing. However, after consideringpetitioner's counterarguments and consulting with the Department's industryanalyst, we have determined that the additional gear function on many slewingrings is no more than an enhancement of the product common to many otherbearings as well. This enhancement is insufficient to distinguish slewingrings from the classes or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigations.Finally, the Department has carefully considered the ``due process'' argumentmade by RES. We are cognizant of the fact that our June 13, 1988, memorandumand our contacts with RES and other respondents at the early stages ofthese investigations initially indicated that slewing rings were consideredoutside the scope of investigation. Recognizing that we may not have beenprivy at that time to all the relevant facts and information, the Department'sJune 13 memorandum alerted interested parties to the possibility that ourdecision with respect to scope might be subject to change. We specifiedthat our decision to exclude slewing rings was based in part on the ``lackof convincing evidence by petitioner that these products are the same classor kind of merchandise as the bearings under investigation.'' We did notat that time close the door to petitioner to provide information at a laterdate that slewing rings were intended to be covered by the petition andresulting investigations. Since then, the petitioner has brought forwardconvincing evidence that slewing rings are of the same classes or kindsof merchandise as the other products under investigation. Since we haveno compelling reason to depart from petitioner's definition of scope, weare clarifying that slewing rings are included in these investigations.As for RES' argument that the investigations cannot include slewing ringswhen specific sales information on that product is lacking, we point outthat the Department's price comparisons frequently involve less than thetotal universe of sales or products sold during the period of investigation.This is obviously the case where sampling or similar simplification proceduresare deemed necessary, as occurred in these investigations. Furthermore,there is no requirement to conduct price comparisons on all types of merchandisewithin the class that is subject to an investigation. <T3>Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies </T3>from Japan (50 FR45447, 45449 (1985)).<T3>Comment 11.</T3> One interested party, Hugo Finkenrath OHG (Finkenrath),contends that split pillow block housings should be excluded from the scopeof investigation because these products neither contain bearings nor arethey bearing parts or subassemblies. Finkenrath points out that housingsare not cited in the petition, and argues that these products were notintended to be covered by the petition. According to Finkenrath, splitpillow block housings are distinct from bearings and bearing parts becausethey have completely different physical characteristics, are produced indifferent facilities using different processes, have different ultimateuses and user expectations, move in different channels of trade, and areadvertised in different ways. Petitioner states that the mere fact that pillow block housings enter undera separate tariff classification does not in itself place them outsidethe scope of the investigation. Petitioner observes that the petition specificallycovered all parts of ground antifriction bearings, that mounted bearingssuch as pillow block units were also explicitly covered, and that thereare many parts within the scope of the investigation that are differentin one or more respects from finished or assembled bearings or their keyparts. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with Finkenrath that split pillow blockhousings should be excluded. Split pillow block housings were neither explicitlynor implicitly mentioned in the petition. Notwithstanding petitioner'sobservations as to the variety of parts included within the scope of thepetition, there is simply no substantive evidence that housings were intendedor ought to be covered by the scope of these investigations. Indeed, theonly factual information which has been provided indicates that pillowblock housings are not bearings, they do not contain bearings, and theyare not parts or subassemblies of bearings. Housings are used to alignand mount bearings, and to support the weight of bearings in applications.They are made of different physical materials, by different producers,according to different production processes and for different applicationsand uses than are bearings. The ``mounted bearings,'' such as pillow blockunits, that are specifically noted in the petition can be clearly distinguishedfrom pillow block housings by the presence of the bearing itself. Therefore,based on these facts, we determine that split pillow block housings whichdo not contain a subject bearing are outside the scope of the investigations.<T3>Comment 12.</T3> SKF Sweden contends that nuts, bolts, and sleevesmanufactured by Mekanproducter are outside the scope of these investigationsbecause they are not ``antifriction bearings or components thereof.'' SKFSweden argues that nuts, bolts, and sleeves are accessories to a bearingwhich assist in attaching other accessories to bearings. In addition, SKFSweden argues that the tariff classification number which covers theseproducts was not listed in the petition, the Department's questionnaire,or the scope of investigation section of the Department's preliminary determinations.Finally, SKF Sweden contends that these items do not fall under any ofthe Department's five classes or kinds of merchandise and were not amongthe list of products explicitly included in these investigations as setforth in Appendix V of the questionnaire. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree. Nuts, bolts, and sleeves which are notintegral parts of a bearing are not subject to these investigations. Accordingly,where such items are imported separate from and unattached to a bearingunder investigation, no antidumping duties will be assessed. However, wheresuch accessories are imported attached to a bearing under investigation,they will be included in the scope of any orders issued, and the valueof such accessories will be included in the assessed value of the enteredproduct. <T3>Comment 13.</T3> BNL Limited (BNL), a British manufacturer/exporterof thermoplastic bearings, contends that its bearings are not properlyincluded in the scope of these investigations. BNL argues that the petition'swritten description of the scope of investigation refers only to <T3>ground</T3> bearings and that the product characteristics and productionprocesses of the bearings described by the petition do not apply to thermoplasticbearings. Thermoplastic bearings are made of <T3>molded</T3> plastic which is neither ground nor heat-treated. Theyare not precision bearings. Some of BNL's thermoplastic bearings do incorporatestainless steel balls, but these balls are<T3> not</T3> ground. Therefore, no part of a thermoplastic bearing isground. BNL also contends that there are different consumer expectations and enduses for thermoplastic bearings. Thermoplastic bearings are not suitablefor heavy load or high speed applications and are much less resistant toheat than the bearings described in the petition. On the other hand, thermoplasticbearings produce little or no noise, are self-lubricating, corrosion resistant,and suitable for use where magnetic interference of the bearing is of concern.BNL also argues that its products, unlike the bearings described in thepetition, can be molded into shapes that would otherwise require the assemblyof separate parts and components. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We determine that thermoplastic bearings are notwithin the scope of these investigations as defined by the petition. Petitionerdescribes the merchandise covered by the petition as<T3> ground</T3> antifriction bearings and parts thereof, both finishedand unfinished. (Petition at page 13.) The inner and outer races of thethermoplastic bearings produced by BNL are not ground as the productionprocess of such bearings does not include or require either heat treatmentor grinding. Accordingly, we find that thermoplastic bearings are not withinthe scope of these investigations. <T3>Comment 14.</T3> Harmonic Drive Division of Quincy Technologies, Inc.(HD) contends that harmonic drive wave generator bearings (wave generatorbearings) made in Japan should not be considered by the Department to bewithin any of the existing bearing categories. HD requests that we separateour analysis of these bearings from our analysis of all other types ofball bearings. HD contends that the wave generator bearings used by it are custom madeto HD's specifications and have no use other than for the wave generatorassembly in a harmonic drive. There are no U.S. bearing manufacturers currentlyin regular production of these bearings. The bearing itself is intentionallydeflected into an elliptoid shape when incorporated into HD's products.Petitioner maintains that since HD concedes the imported merchandise isa bearing, HD's request for exclusion is based on no more than an applicationsargument and should be rejected. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have not treated wave generator bearings differentlyfrom other bearings under investigation. Based on information availableto the Department at this time, we find no reason to believe that wavegenerator bearings are a separate class or kind of merchandise from theball bearings under investigation. Apparently, wave generator bearingsare simply thin race, annular ball bearings. As discussed above, uniqueapplication alone is an insufficient basis for separate treatment in theseinvestigations. Absent convincing evidence that wave generator bearingsare outside the scope of these investigations, or that they constitutea separate class or kind of merchandise, they are properly grouped withall other ball bearings for purposes of our analysis.<T3>Comment 15.</T3> GAR International, on behalf of an importer, YoungEngineers, contends that stainless steel hollow balls are not bearingsin their imported form and should not be subject to any import duties resultingfrom these investigations. Young Engineers contends that stainless steelhollow balls are used in omni directional rollers, which are not bearings.Omni directional rollers are used in aircraft conveyor systems which allowcontainers to be rolled inside aircraft cargo holds. Young Engineers statesthat these stainless steel hollow balls as used in omni directional rollersare made exclusively for their company and there are no domestic manufacturersof this product. Therefore, Young Engineers contends that the stainlesssteel hollow ball should not subject to these antidumping duty investigations.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with GAR as only solid steel balls areused in antifriction bearings, and are needed therein to perform a loadbearing function. Hollow steel balls, on the other hand, are not designedto perform such a function and, to the best of our knowledge, are neverused as rolling elements in the bearings under investigation. Therefore,stainless steel hollow balls are excluded from the scope of these investigations.<T3>Comment 16.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department's June 13,1988, memorandum excluded certain textile-mill components from the scopeof these investigations. Petitioner does not dispute that many textile-millcomponents are not bearings; however, petitioner argues that it providedthe Department with a catalogue that demonstrates that many textile-mill``components'' are antifriction bearings. Among such bearings are thosein which the outer race has been finished with a groove on the outer surfaceof the raceway to serve as a pulley. Petitioner therefore contends thatthe Department should clarify in its final determinations that all antifrictionbearings are covered by the investigations, regardless of tariff classificationas a textile-mill component or any other component or part with a classificationother than as identified in Appendix I to the Department's preliminarydeterminations. FAG and SKF contend that textile-machinery components_ring spinning framecomponents, spindles, texturizing components, rotor spinning components,and miscellaneous textile machinery components_are not antifriction bearingsand, thus, fall within a class or kind of merchandise not properly withinthe scope of these investigations. FAG contends that textile-machinery components are not intended to reducefriction and are not expected to be purchased by the end user to achievethat result. SKF bases its contention on the following points: (1) The petitioner doesnot domestically manufacture textile-machinery components, and SKF is unawareof any U.S. company that manufactures such components; (2) the petitionerhas provided no evidence upon which to base LTFV or CVD allegations; and(3) textile-machinery components constitute a separate and distinct classor kind of merchandise. With respect to this last point, SKF contends thatalthough textile-machinery components may contain rotating parts, suchcomponents are substantially more than bearings; only minor elements ofsuch components resemble a typical bearing. The bearings incorporated intotextile-machinery components, moreover, constitute a miniscule portionof the overall value of such components. Textile-machinery components alsodiffer from antifriction bearings in terms of physical characteristics,ultimate uses, customer needs and expectations, channels of trade, andmethods of advertising and display. Specifically, textile-machinery componentsperform functions much different from and more complex than those of reducingfriction and wear between moving parts. Such products are not used forpurposes of reducing friction; rather, such products are used exclusivelyin spinning and filament processing machines that manufacture yarn. Therotating element is merely a part of the textile-machinery component. SKFsells and distributes spinning frame components directly to textile millsand textile-machinery manufacturers, rotor spinning components to OEMsand distributors, and other textile-machinery components to distributorsof its own selection. Replacement parts comprise approximately ninety-eightpercent of these sales. Reiter USA contends that antifriction bearings imported for ultimate incorporationinto Reiter textile machines as part of service, repair, and maintenanceoperations should be excluded from the scope of these investigations. Allbearings imported by Reiter USA are for incorporation into Reiter textilemachines as part of customer repair operations. Reiter USA is neither awholesaler nor a retailer of antifriction bearings. Reiter USA furthercontends that the final determinations should apply only to U.S. importersthat import and then sell antifriction bearings to all industries. Thefinal determinations should not apply to companies, like Reiter USA, thatimport bearings strictly to service the final product that such companiessell and distribute in the United States. Reiter USA finally contends thatit is ``unfair'' for the Department to subject Reiter to an antidumpingduty rate given that it is not dumping antifriction bearings into the UnitedStates. <T3>Doc Position.</T3> We agree with respondents that textile-machinerycomponents which are substantially advanced in function(s) or value (<T3>i.e.,</T3> products other than the bearings and parts under investigation)fall outside the scope of these investigations. In the Department's June13, 1988 product coverage decision memorandum, we explicitly excluded suchcomponents from the scope of the investigations. We did so, partly becausesuch products were not expressly or implicitly covered by the petition,and because such products are substantially more than bearings. Furthermore,where the value of the antifriction bearings incorporated into textile-machinerycomponents constitute a relatively small portion of the overall value ofsuch components, it appears obvious that the product is substantially morethan a bearing. However, bearings (including mounted or housed units, and flanged or enhancedbearings) which are ultimately utilized in textile machinery are clearlycovered by these investigations.Final application of a bearing under investigation does not remove it fromthe scope of investigation or result in a separate class or kind of merchandise,as discussed above in the general class or kind discussion. For example,the petition at page 18 specifically mentions ``textile machinery'' applicationsas being among the uses and applications of the antifriction bearings coveredby these investigations. We have insufficient information to determine whether specific items vaguelyreferred to as ``textile machinery components'' constitute one or moreseparate classes or kinds of merchandise. An important factor in our determinationis the vagueness of the term itself and the variety of items which it mayencompass. Accordingly, the Department is unable to be more specific inits response. However, it should be clear that any of the subject bearings,regardless of whether they may ultimately be utilized on textile machinery,aircraft, automobiles, or other  equipment, are in fact within the scopeof these investigations. It should also be clear that tariff classificationnumbers are <T3>not </T3>determinative of the products under investigation. <T3>See Diversified Products;</T3> cf. <T3>Roquette Freres </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>583 F. Supp. 599, 605 (CIT, 1984). The writtendescription of the scope of investigation defines the products under investigation.We also disagree with Reiter's contention that antifriction bearings importedfor ultimate incorporation into textile machines as part of service, repair,and maintenance operations should be excluded from the scope of the investigations.Under the U.S. antidumping duty statute, the Department directs the U.S.Customs Service to assess antidumping duties against the importer of recordrather than the foreign exporter that is dumping. Therefore, if Reiteris the importer of record of the antifriction bearings imported for serviceoperations, Reiter will be liable for any antidumping duties attributableto its suppliers. <T3>Comment 17. </T3>Nissan Motor Company, Ltd., and its U.S.-affiliatedcompanies contend that: (1) Wheel hub units imported as part of front andrear axle assemblies, (2) wheel hub units which include tapered rollerbearings, and (3) clutch release bearings which are already assembled asparts of transmissions before importation should be excluded from the scopeof these investigations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with Nissan with regard to all three products.First, axle assemblies for passenger vehicles and trucks constitute morethan a bearing. Second, the petition is explicit with regard to taperedroller bearing products, stating that the petition covers all ground antifrictionbearings and all parts thereof, both finished and unfinished, with theexception of tapered roller bearings. Third, petitioner has indicated that,while clutch release bearings are within the scope of these investigations,those which are imported in complete transmissions or as major subassembliesof automobiles are excluded. <T3>Comment 18. </T3>Petitioner contends that Minebea's database is inadequate,because it failed to report sales of rod ends, spherical plain bearings,and bushings. Therefore, the Department should use as best informationavailable the rate calculated for Minebea in the preliminary determinationof 226.68 percent. Minebea maintains that the Department's plain bearings product scope descriptionwas clear and unambiguous, and that Minebea prepared and furnished itsresponse in accordance with its understanding of the plain bearing coveragedescribed in amended Appendix V of the Department's questionnaire. Minebeafurther maintains that a respondent faced with deciding which productsto report can only make its best interpretation of the Department's descriptionof products subject to investigation and, if uncertain, request clarificationfrom the Department. Minebea contends that it filed numerous requests forclarification and, on at least two occasions, met with Department officialsto discuss product coverage. Minebea maintains that the scope of the investigations as specified inamended Appendix V to the questionnaire was again amended as Appendix Ito the preliminary determinations. The product scope in the preliminarydeterminations contained an additional sentence regarding the plain bearingcategory which stated: ``These products include <T3>all </T3>plain bearings which do not employ rolling elements.'' Minebeacontends that this additional sentence merely describes plain bearingsas bearings that do not employ rolling elements, and that it ambiguouslyconveys the deliminting construction that plain bearings entering underTSUSA numbers other than 681.3900 are not subject to the investigations.Minebea contends that the Department has a responsbility and obligationto respondents to notify them regarding product scope well in advance ofthe date established for the submission of the questionnaire response.It is clearly unfair to hold a respondent responsible for amendments tothe specification of products subject to investigation which are firstpresented in the preliminary determination, unless the Department notifiesthe respondents of its scope change, requests a new submission in accordancewith the new scope, and provides the respondent reasonsable time to submitits new response. Accordingly, Minebea contends that it reasonably interpreted the Department'sspecification of the scope of the products subject to the investigationsin excluding rod ends and all plain bearings other than those which enteredunder TSUSA number 681.3900. Furthermore, because the Department did notprovide at an early stage a clear description of the product coverage,adhere to such coverage during the processing of the investigation, orprovide timely guidance to Minebea's inquiries, it would be harsh and unfairto invoke best information available against Minebea. Moreover, Minebeasubmits that the best information in these investigations is the informationreported by Minebea and verified by the Department. Minebea further contends,however, that if the Department does not use Minebea's information, theDepartment should use the rate of other respondents rather than petitioner'sinformation as best information available. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with respondent. It is well establishedthat the scope of an investigation, as defined by the petition, standsuntil the Department officially clarifies the scope and excludes a productor products therefrom. The express language of the petition and exhibitsthereto specifically cover spherical plain bearings and rod ends. (<T3>See </T3>comments on spherical plain bearings, etc. above). After theDepartment published notices of initiation in these investigations, wereceived numerous submissions seeking clarification of the scope of investigation.As a result, the Department issued a decision memorandum on June 13, 1988,which clarified the coverage of these investigations. That memorandum explicitlystates that ``[r]od ends and rod end bearings * * * <T3>are </T3>subject to these investigations.'' (emphasis supplied in original).Since the express language of Exhibit 4 to the petition and the Department'sdecision memorandum refers, without any qualification, to rod-end bearings,the scope of these investigations covers rod ends with or without rollingelements.At no time during these investigations did the Department exclude sphericalplain bearings or rod ends from the scope of these investigations. (Plainbearings other than spherical plain bearings are not subject to investigationas explained above in the comment regarding those products.) Therefore,such products have always been subject thereto. Minebea, morever, shouldhave been fully aware of our product coverage, at least as of June 13,1988, the date of our decision memorandum. This date was well in advanceof that established for the submission of the questionnaire response (<T3>i.e., </T3>July 7, 1988). Because Minebea failed to submit a complete questionnaire response withrespect to sales of spherical plain bearings and rod ends, the Departmentmust resort to best information otherwise available pursuant to section776(c) of the Act. Section 776(c) authorizes the Department to resort tosuch information ``whenever a party * * * refuses or is unable to produceinformation requested in a timely manner and in the form required * * *.''(emphasis added). For these sales that Minebea failed to report, we used,as best information otherwise available, the highest rate calculated foranother Japanese producer of spherical plain bearings. For those salesof spherical plain bearings and rod ends that Minebea reported, we usedthe information that we verified. We then took the weighted average ofthe best-information rate and the rate based on Minebea's verified informationto arrive at an overall antidumping duty rate for spherical plain bearingsand rod ends. It is important to emphasize that Minebea took a calculated risk in notreporting these sales and then arguing that such products should not beincluded within the scope of the investigations. By contrast, other respondentswho were unsure whether a particular product was included initially reportedsuch sales in their questionnaire responses and then argued that such productsshould be excluded. As a result, the Department had no other option butto resort to best information otherwise available. <T3>Comment 19. </T3>Petitioner contends that it is well established thatthe Department does not limit the scope of its investigations to the TSUSAnumbers specified in the notices. Minebea's reliance on the TSUSA classificationis thus inconsistent with the Department's general practice with regardto the scope of an investigation, as well as the Department's specificactions in these investigations. Minebea maintains that the first paragraph of amended Appendix V of theDepartment's questionnaire identified only rolling element bearings, andthe second paragraph referred specifically to plain bearings. Minebea contendsthat it is most reasonable to assume that the specific reference to thefirst paragraph in the statement ``rod ends entering under the TSUSA categorieslisted in the first paragraph'' indicated that only the rolling elementrod end bearings described by paragraph one are subject to the investigationsand that rod ends without a rolling element identified by paragraph twoare not included. In addition, Minebea contends that a rod end bearingmay contain a ball or roller element or may be a sliding element bearing,and that a plain bearing is not a rolling element bearing. Plain bearingsare not antifriction but high friction sliding element bearings. For thesereasons, Minebea did not report rod ends with a rolling element. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with Minebea's contention that it wasreasonable to assume that the rod ends subject to these investigationswere only rolling element rod ends. As described previously, the expresslanguage of Exhibit 4 to the petition specifically lists ``Rod End Bearings.''The Department's June 13, 1988, product coverage memorandum explicitlystates that rod end bearings, without qualification, are subject to theseinvestigations. Page one of the amended Appendix V to our questionnaireclearly states that ``rod end bearings'' are subject to investigation.Minebea cannot rely on an apparent ambiguity in a later paragraph of thatappendix as its basis for failure to report certain merchandise. If itwere unclear to Minebea which products were subject to investigation, thecompany had a responsibility to bring this ambiguity to the attention ofthe Department and seek clarification. In addition, counsel met with andhad many telephone conversations with Department officials during thistime. We also disagree with the contention advanced by Minebea and Rose thatthese companies had relied on the TSUSA numbers listed in Appendix V tothe questionnaire in not reporting sales data for rod ends and all plainbearings other than those which enter under TSUSA numbers 681.3900. Itis well settled that the Department does not limit the scope of an investigationbased upon the TSUSA numbers listed in its notices, questionnaires, orany other document. The Department provided such numbers for guidance only;the written description of the product, as appearing in the petition andexhibits thereto, as well as in the Department's notices, remains dispositivewith respect to the scope of an investigation. <T3>Comment 20. </T3>AMTB, Dana, Deutsche Star, FAG-FRG, SKF-FRG, and SKF-Franceindividually contend that one or more of the following products shouldbe excluded from the scope of these investigations. The petitioner doesnot produce, and, therefore, lacks standing to file a petition againstthe following products: angular contact bearings, bearings under 30mm inoutside diameter, ``commodity bearings,'' linear motion guides and linearmotion bearings (linear motion devices), ``large-size,'' ``miniature,''and ``small-size'' bearings, and wheel hub units. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>As discussed in previous comments, we have determinedthat linear motion devices are outside the scope of these investigations.Therefore the issue of standing is moot with respect to these devices.We have determined that each of the remaining products are included withinthe five classes or kinds of merchandise under investigation. As we havedetermined that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds, petitioner, therefore, has standing with respect to eachof these products. (<T3>See </T3>also Standing section of this Appendix.)<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 4: Basis for Cost of Production Investigations </ITAG><T3>Comment 1.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department applied an incorrectstandard in its decision to terminate investigations of sales being madebelow the cost of production with respect to cylindrical and needle rollerbearings produced by SKF-Italy. Petitioner cites<T3> Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States, </T3>6 CIT at 250, and argues that the appropriatetest for initiation of a cost investigation is whether the evidence submittedis sufficient to provide a specific and objective basis for believing thatsales may have been made at prices below cost. Further in support of itsargument, petitioner cites <T3>Connors Steel Co. </T3>v.<T3> United States, </T3>2 CIT 242, 527 F. Supp. 350, 357 (1981), modified,3 CIT 79, 566 F. Supp. 1521 (1982), which states that the level of evidencerequired to initiate a cost investigation is less than what is requiredto initiate an antidumping investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department has already addressed the standardon which to initiate a cost investigation in its preliminary determinations.<T3>See, </T3>53 FR 45312 through 53 FR 45368 (November 9, 1988). Petitioner misunderstands the reasons why no cost investigation was initiatedfor cylindrical and needle roller bearings produced by SKF-Italy. The foreignmarket value for SKF-Italy's sales of cylindrical and needle roller bearingswas based on constructed value because, although the home market was viablebased on the class or kind of merchandise, there were no sales of suchor similar merchandise in the home market for comparison. Therefore, therewas no need for the Department to conduct a cost investigation becauseconstructed value was already being used for FMV. <T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department incorrectlydetermined not to initiate cost of production investigations of needleand ball bearings produced by INA-FRG because petitioner submitted a sufficientlevel of evidence to create a reasonable belief of sales below the costof production. INA-FRG submits that the Department did not have a sufficient basis toreinstate the cost investigation of its sales of cylindrical roller bearingseven after the petitioner submitted additional data. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> With respect to INA-FRG's ball and needle rollerbearings, the Department compared the cost of production provided by thepetitioner to the reported home market prices. Since petitioner was unableto separate selling expenses from total SGandamp;A, the Department comparedcost, net SGandamp;A, to home market prices less all movement charges, aswell as all direct and indirect expenses claimed by INA-FRG. The resultsindicated that virtually all ball bearings and needle roller bearings weresold at prices <T3>above</T3> the cost of production. Therefore, the Department had noreason to believe or suspect that those bearings were being sold at pricesbelow the cost of production. However, using petitioner's information and the same methodology describedabove, the Department found that a substantial percentage of INA-FRG'shome market sales of cylindrical roller bearings were below cost. Thisgave the Department sufficient basis to believe or suspect that INA-FRGmade sales of cylindrical roller bearings at prices below the cost of productionand a cost investigation was initiated. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> GMN contends that the record demonstrates that anyGMN sales below cost occurred only in isolated instances and were not madeover an extended period of time. GMN further argues that sporadic, below-costsales may not be disregarded for purposes of computing foreign market valuesince one of the two conditions by which sales may be disregarded underthe statute (19 U.S.C. section 1677b(b)) is if the below cost sales havebeen made over an extended period of time and in substantial quantities.Respondent cites <T3>Toho Titanium Co., Ltd.</T3> v.<T3> United States, </T3>11 CIT _, 657 F. Supp. 1280 (1987) to supportits position that sales below cost of production not be disregarded ifsuch sales ``occurred only sporadically or resulted from a typical, briefbusiness practice * * *'' (657 F. Supp. at 1285). Respondent states that<T3> Timken Co.</T3> v.<T3> United States, </T3>11 CIT _, 673 F. Supp. 495 (1987) also emphasizedthat below-cost sales could be disregarded only if they ``have been madeover an extended period of time as well as in substantial quantities''and that the below cost provision was ``designed to ensure that sales madeat less than cost of production will not automatically be excluded fromconsideration.'' <T3>DOC Position.</T3> As required by section 773(b) of the Act, we investigatewhether sales that are made over an extended period of time are at priceswhich would permit the recovery of all costs within a reasonable amountof time. H.R. Rep. No. 571, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 71; S. Rep. No. 1298,93d Cong., 2d Sess. 7310 (1973). For purposes of our investigations, weconsider the period of investigation to be ``an extended period of time.''<T3>See, Toho Titanium Co.</T3> v.<T3> United States, </T3>657 F. Supp. 1280 (1987). In this investigation,we have determined that a <T3>substantial</T3> quantity of GMN's home market sales were at pricesbelow the cost of production during the period of investigation. Therefore,we have not included these below-cost sales in our calculations. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department's decision notto reinstate cost investigations of SKF-France's sales of spherical rollerbearings and INA-France's sales of ball, cylindrical, and needle rollerbearings, was an abuse of discretion and contrary to law. Petitioner statesthat the Department required all allegations of sales below cost that weresubmitted after SKF-France's submission of data be based on product numbersand prices reported in SKF-France's submission. Petitioner contends thatthis requirement, as well as the ten-day deadline for the resubmissionof data supporting below cost allegations, was unreasonable. Moreover,the allegations actually submitted by petitioner were based almost entirelyon SKF-France's own information. Finally, petitioner contends that it washandicapped in using SKF-France's questionnaire response because SKF-Francedid not provide petitioner with a public version of its response that listedthe product numbers reported. Petitioner holds that an objective basis to believe or suspect sales belowcost in a given country should exist on the basis of price levels in thatcountry coupled with evidence of the most efficient producer's costs. Sinceall manufacturers price commodity bearings alike, and their prices arebelow the most efficient producer's costs, it is unreasonable to ask fora more objective indication of below cost sales. Petitioner also states that the actual standard applied by the Departmentto the reinstatement of the cost investigations unlawfully required petitionerto make cost allegations based on home market sales data submitted by therespondents. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> As the Department noted in its preliminary determinations,<T3>see, </T3>53 FR 45312 through 53 FR 45368 (November 9, 1988), the petitioneris required to provide company-specific data in support of its cost allegations.<T3>See, Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States, </T3>575 F. Supp. 1277 (CIT 1983). In this case, thecourt concluded that ``absent a specific and objective basis for suspectingthat a particular foreign firm is engaged in home market sales at pricesbelow its cost of production, the [Section 773(b)] standard has not beensatisfied.'' <T3>Ibid.</T3> at 1282. (emphasis added). Petitioner wants the Departmentto initiate a cost investigation on mere speculation. However, the Departmentcannot justify initiating country-wide cost investigations based on suchbroad speculative allegations. The Department did not reinstate a cost investigation of SKF-France's salesof spherical roller bearings because there were no sales of spherical rollerbearings, cited in the petitioner's allegations, in the home market duringthe POI. Our views with respect to the adequacy of responses are addressedin the Administrative Protective Order and Public Summaries section ofthis appendix.The Department did not reinstate cost investigations of INA-France's salesof ball, cylindrical, and needle roller bearings because petitioner didnot submit new allegations after these investigations were discontinued.We informed petitioner in our letter of August 22, 1988, that the Departmentwould consider new cost allegations submitted by petitioner. We receivedno further allegations. <T3>Comment 5. </T3>NSK and NTN contend that they were deprived of theirright to a hearing on cost of production issues because the Departmentdid not inform them of its treatment of their reported cost informationand methodology. NSK and NTN argue that the Department must therefore terminateits cost investigations of NSK and NTN. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Even though these cost investigations were not reinstatedin time for data to be submitted and analyzed for consideration in thepreliminary determinations, the Department reinstated cost investigationsin time for data to be submitted and analyzed for consideration in thefinal determinations. This has been our practice in other cases as well.<T3>See, Stainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden, </T3>53 FR 37810(October 9, 1987) and <T3>Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan,</T3>53 FR 12552 (April 15, 1988). Furthermore, respondents had the opportunityto rebut allegations in support of petitioner's request for the reinstatementof cost investigations and were able to reiterate their objection to thereinstatement of cost investigations at the public hearing held for theseinvestigations. None of respondents' rights have been abrogated in the course of thesecost investigations. The methodology used by the Department in cost investigationsis outlined in 19 CFR 353.7(a). In addition, our case-specific methodologyused in previous investigations is available to respondents on the publicrecord. Furthermore, if requested, respondents will be accorded a disclosureof the Department's final determinations with regard to these cost investigations.No such disclosure was previously accorded to respondents because, as explainedabove, respondents' cost data was not used for purposes of the preliminarydeterminations. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 5: Market Viability </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore contends that the Department erredin basing home market viability on the class or kind of merchandise ratherthan upon such or similar merchandise as provided for in section 773(a)of the Act. NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that the viability test mustbe performed for each such or similar category in order to ascertain whetherthere is a sufficient quantity of comparable products to provide a reliablebasis for calculating foreign market value, and that the viability testin this investigation does not measure whether a sufficient quantity ofsuch or similar products exists. In support of its argument, respondentcites <T3>Lightweiqht Polyester Filament Fiber from Japan; Final Determinationof Sales at Less Than Fair Value </T3>(49 FR 472, January 4, 1984) (<T3>LPFF</T3>), where the Department rejected arguments that the viabilitytest should be calculated on the class or kind of merchandise. NMB/Pelmec Singapore also maintains that the Department was unfair andprejudicial by not providing any notice and opportunity for comment byinterested parties who may be adversely affected by this change in practice.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>To determine whether there are sufficient salesof the subject merchandise in the home market to serve as the basis forcalculating foreign market value, our normal practice and preference hasbeen to compare the volume of home market sales to the volume of thirdcountry sales within each respective such or similar category. In the caseof <T3>LPFF </T3>cited by respondent, we rejected arguments in favor of determininghome market viability based on the class or kind of merchandise becausewe were able to clearly establish such or similar categories of merchandise.In developing criteria for such or similar comparisons in these investigations,we reviewed the matching criteria set forth in the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan </T3>(52FR 30790, August 17, 1987). In addition, as we stated in our preliminarydeterminations in these cases (53 FR 45343, November 9, 1988), we soughtand considered comments from interested parties and consulted product expertsat the U.S. Customs Service, the ITC, and the Department. Given the enormousnumber of products sold and the numerous physical permutations among bearingtypes, it would have been impossible to determine home market viabilitybased on such or similar categories within each class or kind of merchandisewithin the statutorily-imposed time constraints of these investigations.As explained in detail in Section B-2 of the questionnaire, in those instanceswhere it was necessary to make similar product comparisons (<T3>i.e., </T3>when a company had less than the minimum 33 percent by volumeof identical matches for a given class or kind of merchandise), respondentswere instructed to match exactly the following four criteria: (1) Numberof rows of rolling elements; (2) load direction; (3) bearing design; and(4) precision rating. Selection of the most similar product was then basedon the following four additional criteria: (1) Outside diameter; (2) insidediameter; (3) width; and (4) dynamic load rating. Respondents were instructedto select the home market product(s) that deviated from the U.S. productby ten percent or less with respect to each of these latter four criteria.From this pool of possible matches, respondents were then to determinethe maximum of calculated deviations and select as the most similar merchandisethe home product with the smallest maximum deviation. Due to the number of physical characteristics needed to select most similarmerchandise and the fact that the ten percent deviation is not a determinatefactor, we determined that the only feasible method was to calculate homemarket viability on the basis of each class or kind of merchandise categorywhich we have defined to include finished bearings and parts thereof. With respect to respondent's argument that parties were not given the opportunityto comment on the methodology used to determine home market viability,this is simply inaccurate. As we stated throughout the questionnaire, ifthe respondents had any questions concerning categorization of products,they were to notify the Department immediately. We note that NMB/PelmecSingapore did not raise any questions or submit any comments on the treatmentof parts in the viability test until after we requested third country salesinformation. The methodology was explained in the preliminary determinations,as noted above, and all parties had opportunity to comment thereon. Furthermore,we have in fact considered comments submitted by NMB/Pelmec Singapore,as well as other respondents in these investigations, regarding the viabilitydetermination based on the class or kind of merchandise including parts,but none has persuaded us to change our decision (<T3>see </T3>also <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 3</T3> below).<T3>Comment 2. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore contends that, contrary to theDepartment's statement that it was virtually impossible to identify suchor similar categories within each class or kind of merchandise, the Departmentdid in fact identify such or similar categories in Appendix V of the questionnairein accordance with section 771(16) of the Act. Furthermore, respondentmaintains that since the class includes parts, whereas the such or similarcategory does not, it would be easier to identify the such or similar categorythan the class. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At the time these investigations were initiated,we treated the merchandise outlined in the petition as one class or kindof merchandise. Accordingly, on May 31, 1988, we issued Section A of thequestionnaire which identified on the first page of the ``General Instructions''(which references Appendix V) five ``such or similar'' categories withinthat one class or kind of merchandise as follows: ``(1) Ball Bearings andParts Thereof; (2) Spherical Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof; (3) CylindricalRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof; (4) Needle Roller Bearings and PartsThereof; and (5) Plain Bearings and Parts Thereof.'' In addition, the formatinstructions for the sales listings which were appended to the questionnairestate that the product categories include parts. We instructed respondentsto classify their sales information for viability purposes into these fivecategories of merchandise which specifically included parts. Therefore,it is clear that from the outset of these investigations, parts were includedin the categories of merchandise on which the viability test was to bemade. On July 13, 1988, approximately six weeks after the issuance of SectionA of the questionnaire, we determined that the subject merchandise constitutesfive separate classes or kinds of merchandise corresponding to the previously-definedsuch or similar categories (<T3>see </T3>also discussion of Class or Kind of Merchandise section ofthis Appendix). The decision to establish five classes or kinds of merchandisedid not in any way alter the inclusion of parts in those categories. Furthermore,for the reasons outlined in detail in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 1, </T3>home market viability was calculated on the basis ofeach class or kind of merchandise which includes parts. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore and FAG-FRG have objected to theinclusion of parts in determining market viability, contending that partsand complete bearings are not such or similar merchandise. Moreover, becausemany parts are needed to produce a single complete bearing, the inclusionof parts in the calculation of market viability skews the results. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For the reasons stated above, we performed our marketviability test on the basis of the class or kind of merchandise ratherthan individual such or similar categories. However, not until approximatelysix months after these investigations were initiated, did parties firstraise the issue that the results of the viability test might be skewedby the inclusion of parts in the calculation. In order to evaluate theseproblems, on October 19, 1988, we requested additional information fromrespondents on whether parts were included in their viability calculationsand on the number of parts in a complete bearing. Based on our analysisof the responses, we determined that it would not be possible to equatea specific number of parts to whole bearings because of the varied factualsituations. For example, most respondents did not sell all parts of bearings.Thus, it was inappropriate to assume that a certain number of parts wereequivalent to a complete bearing. Given this situation and the fact thatthe scope of these investigations includes both parts and complete bearings,we deemed it appropriate to include parts in our viability calculations.To address possible problems of skewed results arising from the inclusionof parts, we identified those companies and classes or kinds of merchandisewhere the home market was deemed non-viable through the inclusion of partsin the calculation and performed the viability test again, excluding parts.In the case of SKF Sweden's spherical roller bearings, we found that theratio of home market to third country sales was less than five percentwhether or not parts were included in the viability calculation. Therefore,we determined that third country sales are the appropriate basis for determiningforeign market value.In the case of NMB/Pelmec Singapore, we found that the company's varioussubmissions on value and volume of sales data were inconsistent with respectto which parts were reported and on what basis (<T3>i.e.,</T3> date of shipment vs. date of purchase order) they were reported.These anomalies contributed to our difficulty in assessing the viabilityof the Singapore home market. Furthermore, we found that the ratio of homemarket to third  country sales did not increase substantially by excludingparts from the viability calculation. Therefore, we found that the inclusionof parts did not skew the results of the viability test in this case andthat the home market was not viable. For this reason, we determined thatthird country sales are the appropriate basis for determining foreign marketvalue for NMB/Pelmec Singapore. However, we found for three companies_FAG-FRG, SKF Sweden (ball bearings),and SKF Italy_that the elimination of parts from the viability test ledto a substantial increase in the ratio of home market to third countrysales, indicating that the inclusion of parts had skewed the results ofthe viability test. For each of these companies, we then examined whetherwe would obtain more identical matches to products sold in the United Statesif we used home market or third country sales. Since we have already limitedour comparisons to sales of identical merchandise (except in a very limitednumber of cases where the percentage of identical matches fell below 33percent) (<T3>see,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of this Appendix),we believe that, in the context of our simplified matching methodology,it is appropriate in these three instances to base foreign market valueon the market where we will obtain the largest number of comparisons withinthis limited pool in order to increase the accuracy of our results. With respect to spherical roller bearings sold by FAG-FRG, we determinedthat home market sales serve as the most appropriate basis for foreignmarket value because (1) the home market is substantially larger than anythird country market, and (2) the percentage of identical matches usingthe home market was so great  that it is highly unlikely that any thirdcountry market would provide a greater percentage of identical matchesto products sold in the United States. However, with respect to ball bearings and parts thereof from SKF Swedenand SKF Italy, we found that there is a higher percentage of identicalproducts sold in the third country market than in the respective home market.Therefore, we determined that third country sales serve as a more appropriatebasis for foreign market value than home market sales. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that ball bearing partscannot be considered as such or similar to finished ball bearings for thefollowing reasons: (a) The sales value per part is only a small percentageof the sales value per finished bearing; (b) ball bearing parts are notof the same general class or kind of merchandise due to physical differencesbetween ball bearing parts and finished bearings; (c) ball bearing partsare not like finished ball bearings in purpose; (d) ball bearing partscannot reasonably be compared with finished bearings. Mixing similar completebearings with dissimilar parts, none of which individually or in combinationcould be sufficient to constitute a finished, unfinished or substantiallycomplete ball bearing, distorts the viability test. NMB/Pelmec Singaporealso argues that because it does not sell any parts to unrelated partiesand exports only a <T3>de minimis</T3> quantity of parts to the United States, the comminglingof parts with completed bearings is distortive. Furthermore, respondent argues that it would not be administratively feasibleto compare parts and bearings, as this  would involve comparisons of allprice adjustments and charges for each, as well as cost adjustments. Inaddition, the Department's questionnaire did not treat parts and finishedbearings as such or similar, nor did the Department's product comparisonmethodology suggest that parts should be compared with finished bearings.Petitioner argues that NMB/Pelmec Singapore has incorrectly asserted thatball bearings and parts thereof do not constitute such or similar merchandisepursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1677(16)(A). The Department has determined that thescope of this investigation encompasses ball bearings and parts thereof.Given the language of the petition and notice of initiation, it is irrelevantthat separate parts are not identical to a finished bearing. Furthermore,there is no statutory or regulatory requirement that the such or similardesignation differ from the class or kind designation. Citing <T3>Operators for Jalousie and Awning Windows from El Salvador</T3> (51FR 41520, November 17, 1986) and <T3>Mirrors in Stock Sheet and Lehr-End Sizes from Portugal</T3> (51 FR43409, December 2, 1986), petitioner maintains that the Department hasoften based the viability test on a single such or similar category ofmerchandise coextensive with the class or kind of merchandise. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> For the reasons explained in detail in the <T3>DOC Position</T3> to <T3>Comment 1,</T3> we calculated home market viability on each class orkind of merchandise including parts. However, we have not compared partsof bearings to complete bearings for purposes of our price-to-price analysis.<T3>Comment 5. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that related party salesof parts cannot be considered in assessing home market viability becausethere were no sales of parts to unrelated parties. In support of its argument,respondent cites <T3>Color Picture Tubes from Korea </T3>(<T3>CPTs</T3>) (52 FR 44186, November 18, 1987), in which case the Departmentexcluded sales to related parties from the home market viability calculationbecause those sales were not made at arm's length and, thus, could notbe used in calculating foreign market value. NMB/Pelmec Singapore furthercontends that parts may be properly included within the scope of an investigationonly in those cases where an antidumping order already exists on the finishedproduct, and a company begins exporting parts, which are entered free ofantidumping duties, and assembles these parts in the United States in orderto circumvent the antidumping order. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Under section 773(a)(1) of the Act, the Departmentis required to determine whether home market sales form an adequate basisfor comparison. Section 353.4 of our regulations establishes the test formaking this determination. Normally, we require that the volume of homemarket sales comprise at least five percent of the volume of sales to thirdcountry markets in order for the home market to be deemed ``viable.'' Neitherthe statute nor the regulations specifically addresses the issue of whether``sales'' to related parties should be included for purposes of determiningthe viability of the home market. Where home market sales are made through a related party seller, it wouldusually make little difference for purposes of performing the viabilitytest if the producer reported sales to the related party or sales by therelated party. Absent unusual circumstances, we would expect the amountof sales to the related party to approximate the amount of sales made bythe related party. Unlike these more normal situations, the <T3>CPTs </T3>case presented unique facts. Many of the home market salesby the CPT producers were to related parties who did not resell the CPTs.Instead, the related purchasers used the CPTs to produce color televisionreceivers (CTVs). In that case, the first sale to an unrelated party wasthe sale of a completed CTV which was not considered to be within the sameclass or kind of merchandise as the CPT alone and which was outside thescope of the investigation. The <T3>CPTs </T3>case does not apply to the instant investigation becausethe ball bearing parts sold to related parties in the home market and thirdcountries are used to produce complete ball bearings which are within thescope of the investigation and which are considered the same class or kindof merchandise as the ball bearing parts. As we noted in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 3 </T3>above, we have taken into consideration the effect ofsales of parts on the viability calculations and have found that, in thecase of NMB/Pelmec Singapore, the inclusion of parts did not skew the resultsof the calculations. With respect to respondent's argument regarding circumvention, we agreethat one reason a petitioner may seek to include parts in the scope ofan investigation may be to avoid potential circumvention problems. However,parts may also be included in a petition and, subsequently, in an investigationbecause of concerns about sales at less than fair value of the parts aswell as of the completed merchandise. In these investigations, the petitionincluded parts within the scope and, therefore, we have included them inthe investigations. <T3>Comment 6. </T3>FAG-FRG argues that although the Department preliminarilydetermined its home market was not viable for spherical roller bearings,it is inappropriate to use third country sales as the basis for foreignmarket value because (1) sales to individual third country markets constitutea smaller sales volume of complete bearings than that sold in the homemarket, and (2) most of its selling activity occurs in the home market.Therefore, FAG contends that, if the Department does not use home marketas the basis for foreign market value, it should use the verified constructedvalue data for spherical roller bearings. Petitioner maintains that FAG-FRG's home market sales of spherical rollerbearings are inadequate, as concluded by the Department for purposes ofthe preliminary determination, and contends that the non-viable sales shouldnot be used for the final determination. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We originally determined that FAG-FRG's home marketfor spherical roller bearings was not viable based on the ratio of homemarket to third country sales of spherical roller bearings and parts thereof.After consideration of FAG-FRG's arguments that the inclusion of partsin the calculation of home market viability skewed the results, we havereexamined this issue and determined that the home market is the most appropriatebasis for foreign market value for the reasons stated in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 3 </T3>above. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>INA-FRG maintains that the Department should determinehome market viability on a product-by-product basis. Where the volume ofsales of a particular product in the home market is less than five percentof the volume of sales of the same product in the U.S. market, which isthe situation with inch-sized bearings, the Department should disregardthese home market transactions. In support of its argument, INA cites the<T3>Final Administrative Review of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Red Raspberriesfrom Canada </T3>(<T3>Red Raspberries</T3>) (54 FR 6559, February 13, 1989), in which theDepartment disregarded certain home market sales that satisfied the homemarket viability test but which were negligible compared to the volumeof sales to the United States. INA further maintains that if the Departmentdeems that these sales should not be disregarded, then the Department shouldcompare the U.S. price with the constructed value of the particular bearing.Petitioner argues that on the basis of such or similar categories identifiedby the Department, INA's home market sales for each of the bearing categoriesproduced by INA were viable. Petitioner maintains that INA's interpretationgoes beyond the scope of the Department's determination in Red Raspberries.Furthermore, by excluding these sales from price comparisons, it wouldbe uncertain whether reported sales would fall below the 33 percent thresholdof comparison sales. In addition to conflicting with the statutory schemefor determining viability, INA's proposal is administratively unfeasibleand impractical. Petitioner also takes issue with INA's argument that theDepartment should base foreign market value on constructed value, as thisinformation has not been verified. <T3>DOC Position. </T3> The purpose of the viability test is to establishthe appropriate market for determining foreign market value through a comparisonof the level of home market sales with the level of third country sales.For the reasons outlined in the preliminary determinations in these investigationsand reiterated in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 1 </T3>above, due to the enormous number of products sold andthe numerous physical permutations among bearing types, it would have beenvirtually impossible to determine home market viability based on such orsimilar categories within each class or kind of merchandise. The same reasonsrender even more impracticable respondent's suggestion that the viabilitytest be performed on an individual product basis. Even if these investigationsdid not involve so many individual products, the Department normally performsthe viability test on the basis of comparison of home market and thirdcountry sales within each such or similar category of merchandise (<T3>see </T3>also <T3>Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Greece</T3>, 54 FR 8771, March2, 1989). We then make comparisons to the identical or most similar productwithin that group, regardless of the quantity sold (<T3>see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Mirrors inStock and Lehr End Sizes from Portugal</T3>, 51 FR 43409, December 2, 1986).(<T3>See </T3>also comments on Sales Not in the Ordinary Course of Tradein the Miscellaneous Issues section of this Appendix.) To do otherwisecould result in a need to perform several thousands of individual viabilitydeterminations, posing severe obstacles to resolution of the viabilityissue within the statutorily-imposed time constraints of antidumping dutyinvestigations.Further, respondent misconstrues the <T3>Red Raspberries </T3>determination. The Department found an unusualsituation in that case, with the home market technically viable under thefive percent test outlined in the regulations, but with home market andthird country sales that were so small as to be ``negligible''. There wasonly one home market sale in that case. By contrast, in this case the volumeof INA's home market and third country sales is both substantially greaterthan the volume of its U.S. sales and large in absolute terms as well.For the reasons stated above, the issue of using constructed value as thebasis of foreign market value for the products in question is moot. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that the sales figuresit provided demonstrate that the home market is viable. Using the dataof its July 18, 1988 submission, which reported sales of all finished bearingsand bearing rings on a shipment basis, the viability ratio calculated onlywith respect to complete bearings is greater than five percent. When partsare included with bearings, the ratio is less than five percent. Usingthe data of the October 24, 1988 submission, which reported sales on apurchase order basis, the viability ratio with or without bearing partsis also greater than five percent. If sale of other parts such as retainers,shields and snap rings, which were not reported but which were obtainedat verification, are included in addition to sales of rings in the viabilityanalysis, the ratio far exceeds five percent. For these reasons, NMB/Pelmeccontends that the home market sales exceed the regulatory standard of fivepercent of third country sales. Petitioner maintains that the Department correctly rejected NMB/PelmecSingapore's home market sales pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1677(a) and 19 CFR353.4. Respondent failed to perform the home market viability test as instructedby the Department and failed to consult with the Department regarding thehome market viability test before submitting Sections B and C of the questionnaireresponse. Furthermore, petitioner maintains that respondent's argumentswere raised after the Department performed the home market viability testbased on the sales information submitted in Section A of the questionnaireresponse. For these reasons, the Department should not reverse its determinationthat the Singapore home market is not viable. In addition, petitioner takesissue with the discrepancies between the sales volume data reported inthe July 18 response and the October 24 submission. Petitioner maintainsthat because discrepancies were found at verification, home market salesvolume data provides an unreliable basis for determining foreign marketvalue. Finally, citing <T3>Certain Steel Wire Nails from Korea </T3>(45 FR 34941, May 23, 1980),petitioner maintains that the Department's five percent guideline is nota mandatory number for determining home market viability. For the above reasons, petitioner maintains that the Department shouldresort to the use of best information available and utilize the highestmargin set forth in the petition for purposes of the final determination.Alternatively, petitioner argues that the Department should base foreignmarket value on third country sales or constructed value data which havebeen verified. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>According to the original value and volume of salesdata submitted by NMB/Pelmec Singapore on July 18, 1988 in response toSection A of the questionnaire and the data submitted on September 6, 1988in response to Sections B-E of the questionnaire, sales in the home marketaccount for less than five percent of sales to third country markets. Thisdetermination was based on a comparison of the volume of home market tothird country sales of ball bearings and parts thereof. Therefore, on September23, 1988, we notified NMB/Pelmec Singapore that its home market was notviable and requested that third country sales data be submitted. Due to the numerous comments on the calculation of home market viabilityreceived from many respondents in the concurrent antidumping investigationsinvolving antifriction bearings, we issued a short questionnaire on October19, 1988, seeking clarification on how each respondent had treated partsin the reporting of its sales data (<T3>e.g., </T3>parts separate from complete bearings) and how each calculatedhome market viability (<T3>e.g., </T3>based on complete bearings only or based on the total ofparts and complete bearings). On October 24, 1988, one week prior to thepreliminary determinations, we received a response from NMB/Pelmec Singaporewhich provided revised value and volume of sales figures based on the dateof the purchase order (as opposed to the date of shipment which was usedas the basis for reporting the value and volume of sales figures in theJuly 18 and September 6, 1988 responses). This revised information indicatedthat the ratio of home market sales to third country sales, whether ornot parts were included in the calculation, was slightly above the fivepercent guideline normally used as a determinant of home market viability.It is incumbent upon the Department to establish early on in an investigationthe appropriate market to use as the basis for foreign market value. Failureto identify the appropriate market during the early stages of an investigationwould impose an overwhelming burden on respondents to submit complete dataon all sales to all markets prior to a decision on market viability. Webelieve it more reasonable and advisable to assess market viability andthen request the appropriate price data for the market deemed to be theappropriate basis for foreign market value. In this investigation, theinformation available to us early on was the July 18 and September 6, 1988responses which indicated that the ratio of home market sales to thirdcountry sales including parts was below five percent, and the ratio excludingparts was only slightly above five percent. Therefore, we determined thatit was appropriate to verify third country sales information and use thatinformation as the basis for foreign market value. The unusual circumstances in this investigation, including the complexityof the products, the fact that the exclusion of parts from the viabilitycalculation does not alter significantly the results of that calculation,and the fact that respondent's sales data changed from one submission tothe next, render the third country sales the most appropriate and reliablebasis for foreign market value for NMB/Pelmec Singapore. With respect to respondent's comment that the ratio of home market to thirdcountry sales would increase substantially by including in the calculationsales of parts not reported in any of the responses, we maintain that itis the obligation of respondent to provide an accurate and complete responseprior to verification so that the Department may have the opportunity toanalyze the information fully. (<T3>See, Chinsung </T3>v. <T3>U.S., </T3>Slip Op. 89-15 at 8 (CIT, February 7, 1989). The fact thatrespondent presented new information at verification with respect to partsthat were not reported but which should have been reported, cannot affectthe original determination that the home market was not viable. <T3>Comment 9. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that sales figures wereproperly reported for the home market viability test. It argues that noneof the questions in the questionnaire requested a calculation of home marketviability. NMB/Pelmec Singapore interpreted the instructions as meaningthat only the questions themselves needed to be answered, and that thesubmission of data relevant and necessary to conduct the home market viabilitytest was sufficient to satisfy any reference to home market viability madein the explanatory portion of the text. However, when the Department issueda separate home market viability questionnaire on October 19, 1988, NMB/PelmecSingapore performed the viability calculation for this separate questionnaire.Furthermore, NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that the Department declinedto provide any specific explanation regarding the basis of its determinationthat the Singapore market is not viable. NMB/Pelmec Singapore requeststhat the Department reconsider its position and provide justification tosupport its conclusion that the home market is not viable.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>On July 31, 1988, we issued to all respondents inthese investigations sections B-E of the questionnaire which includes onpage B-2 specific instructions to perform a viability calculation and toshow the calculations. In its September 6, 1988 response, NMB/Pelmec Singapore provided the totalvalue and volume of sales for both complete ball bearings and ball bearingparts, but did not perform the actual viability calculations as requested.After analyzing the sales data and performing the viability calculations,we determined that the home market was not viable and, therefore, did notprovide an appropriate basis for foreign market value. Accordingly, onSeptember 23, 1988, we informed NMB/Pelmec Singapore that its home marketwas determined to be non-viable and that it should provide third countrydata. The third country data was submitted too late to be fully analyzedfor purposes of the preliminary determination. However, it was subsequentlyanalyzed and verified and, therefore, has been used for purposes of thefinal determination. <T3>Comment 10. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore argues that if the Departmentinsists upon the non-viability of home market sales, then the foreign marketvalue should be based upon constructed value data. NMB/Pelmec contendsthat constructed value is a better estimate of home market prices thanthird country data and, furthermore, this data has been verified and foundto be reliable. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For the reasons already stated above, we have determinedthat NMB/Pelmec Singapore's sales to Japan constitute the most appropriatebasis for foreign market value. Furthermore, the statute and regulationsexpress a strong preference for the use of prices (<T3>see </T3>section 773(a) of the Act, as amended; 19 CFR 353.4(b); Statementsof Administrative Action, H.R. Rep. No. 153, pt. II, 96th Cong. 1st Sess.411 (1979)). Since the third country data has been submitted, analyzed,and verified, we have determined that it is the most appropriate basisfor foreign market value. <T3>Comment 11. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department's preliminarydetermination that the home market in Thailand is viable was based on domesticsales figures which incorrectly included cancelled sales and exports toSingapore. Petitioner further contends that bearings exported to Singaporeand subsequently re-imported into Thailand should not be included as homemarket sales because (1) These products were not merely transshipped throughSingapore, but were resold in Singapore to an unrelated party before re-importationinto Thailand and, as such, these sales entered the commerce of Singapore;(2) it was not verified that NMB/Pelmec knew that these bearings wouldeventually return to Thailand; and (3) the public record in the companioncountervailing duty investigation shows that sales to Singapore were deemedexport sales by Thai Customs authorities for purposes of export statisticsand for the export subsidy programs found to provide subsidies in the countervailingduty investigation. By excluding the cancelled sales and the exports toSingapore from the calculation of home market viability, petitioner contendsthat the home market in Thailand is not viable.With respect to cancelled sales, NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that even byexcluding such sales, the home market is still viable. With respect tothe sales through Singapore, NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that these bearings,which were routed through a related selling agent in Singapore before beingdelivered to the ultimate unrelated purchaser located in Thailand, areproperly considered home market sales because (1) NMB/Pelmec Thai knewat the time of the sale that the products were destined for delivery andconsumption in the home market, and (2) the products did not enter thecommerce of Singapore. Citing <T3>Hydrogenated Castor Oil from Brazil </T3>(50 FR 51725, December 19,1985), respondent argues that the Department considers knowledge by themanufacturer of the destination of the merchandise as the controlling factorin finding the existence of home market sales. Respondent further arguesthat knowledge of the destination is critical to a determination of dumpingsince dumping itself is price discrimination. If a company has no knowledgeof the final destination, it cannot discriminate between the market ofdestination and other markets. Therefore, respondent maintains, the spiritof the antidumping law, as well as the policies set forth in the Department'spractices and 1984 amendments to section 19 U.S.C. 1677b, dictate thatthese sales must be considered home market sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We found at verification that NMB/Pelmec Thai hasknowledge that the sales which are transshipped through Singapore are ultimatelydestined for delivery and consumption in Thailand. However, there are unusualcircumstances in this case that, on balance, argue in favor of characterizingthese sales as export sales. For example, because these sales are exemptfrom certain taxes and import duties associated with other home marketsales, the prices of these sales are not typical home market prices. Inaddition, the goods are physically exported from Thailand, and the firstsale to an unrelated party takes place in Singapore. Therefore, contraryto respondent's assertion, these products do, in fact, enter the commerceof Singapore. Lastly, these sales earn export subsidies and are consideredexports by the Government of Thailand for purposes of maintaining exportstatistics. All of these factors combined outweigh the importance of knowledgeof the final destination in the determination of whether these sales areproperly considered home market or third country sales. Therefore, we havedetermined that these sales are third country sales. With respect to the comments on NMB/Pelmec Thai's cancelled sales, we havedetermined that these sales should properly be excluded from the home marketdatabase. Therefore, by excluding the products actually sold in Singaporeand the cancelled sales, as well as NMB/Pelmec Thai's sales to relatedbonded warehouses, from the total home market sales reported, we have foundthat the Thai home market is not viable and, thus, does not provide theappropriate basis for establishing foreign market value. Accordingly, wehave used verified constructed value data as best information availablefor purposes of this final determination. <T3>Comment 12. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that the different categorizationof the same sales under U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws isnot contrary to either statute. The demands of the different laws requirea different treatment of the same factual situation in order to complywith both laws. Specifically, NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that the classification of the salesrouted through Singapore as exports in the concurrent countervailing dutyinvestigation is irrelevant in the antidumping proceeding. The classificationof these sales in the two proceedings serves different purposes. In a countervailingduty proceeding, the object of classification of export versus domesticsales is to ensure that the <T3>ad valorem </T3>subsidy calculation is based on the appropriate salesvalue. The value of export subsidies is divided by the total value of eligibleexport sales for which such export subsidies were granted in order to arriveat an <T3>ad valorem </T3>amount. If export subsidies are granted for particularsales under Thai law, then such sales are correctly categorized as exportsales under the U.S. countervailing duty law. NMB/Pelmec Thai also argues that, for purposes of the antidumping proceeding,the paramount objective of categorization is to ensure that the Departmentproperly measures price discrimination between markets. If the companyknows at the time of sale that the merchandise is destined for the homemarket, then such sales are appropriately considered domestic sales underthe U.S. antidumping duty law. Petitioner asserts that a discussion of the issue of how export subsidiesbestowed on home market sales should be treated for purposes of a U.S.price comparison shows the inherent contradiction in treating NMB/PelmecThai's sales to Singapore as home market sales. Petitioner contends thatdisparate treatment is unreasonable given that the intent of both the antidumpingand countervailing duty laws is to identify and distinguish home marketsales for the purpose of determining whether there is unfair trade. Citing<T3>Bingham andamp; Taylor </T3>v. <T3>U.S., </T3>815 F.2nd 1482, 1486 (Fed. Cir. 1987), petitioner arguesthat a similar approach adopted by the ITC has been rejected by the FederalCircuit. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have determined that the sales at issue are exportsales for purposes of the concurrent countervailing duty investigationbecause such sales earn export subsidies and are considered exports bythe Government of Thailand for trade statistics purposes. (<T3>See </T3>the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Partial CountervailingDuty Order: Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof from Thailand </T3>publishedin this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.) We have also determined that such sales areexport sales for purposes of the antidumping investigation because thegoods are physically exported from Thailand, with the first sale to anunrelated party taking place in a third country. Therefore, we considerthat the goods enter the commerce of that third country. Furthermore, it would be inappropriate to treat these sales differentlyin this case than we did in the countervailing duty case. The antidumpingand countervailing duty laws comprise two separate, statutory provisionsof the same statute_the Trade and Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Althoughthese two provisions are separate and distinct, their purposes are thesame; that is, to offset any unfair trade advantage enjoyed by a foreignexporter. <T3>Cf. Bingham andamp; Taylor Div., Va. Industries </T3>v. <T3>U.S., </T3>815 F.2nd 1482, 1486 (Fed. Cir. 1987). As such, the Departmentmust interpret consistently similar or identical factual situations arisingunder the two statutory provisions to ensure that these provisions operateharmoniously. <T3>Cf. Ambassador Div. of Florsheim Shoe </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>748 F.2nd 1560, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1984). <T3>Comment 13. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that the Department's interpretationof the statutory preference for home market sales under section 773 ofthe Act and its viability regulation, 19 CFR 353.4, clearly indicates thatif the five percent threshold is met, the use of home market sales as thebasis for foreign market value is mandatory. NMB/Pelmec Thai further contendsthat the flexibility in using the five percent standard as a guidelinehas not been applied in situations in which the viability ratio exceededthe five percent. To do so, respondent contends, would violate the strongstatutory preference for home market sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have found that, by excluding NMB/Pelmec Thai'scancelled sales, the sales found to be made to Singapore, and sales madeto related bonded warehouses, the ratio of the volume of NMB/Pelmec Thai'shome market sales to third country sales does not reach the five percentthreshold normally used to establish home market viability. Therefore,we have not used home market sales as the basis for foreign market value.In the absence of third country sales data, as best information available,we have used NMB/Pelmec Thai's verified constructed value data.<T3>Comment 14. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that its July 18 responseseparated home market and third country sales depending on whether thesales were to related parties or unrelated parties. Respondent furtherstates that related party sales were included in the viability calculationbecause these sales were made at arm's length. Petitioner contends that related party sales should not be included asdomestic sales for purposes of determining home market viability. Petitionerfurther argues that respondent was unable to demonstrate that these saleswere, in fact, made at arm's length. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>As a matter of standard procedure, Section A ofthe Department's questionnaire requests total value and volume of salesdata for the domestic market and third country markets broken down by relatedand unrelated sales. In its July 18, 1988 response, NMB/Pelmec Thai reportedits sales data accordingly. Based on the data contained in that submission,the Department determined that NMB/Pelmec Thai's home market was viable.Neither the statute nor the regulations specifically addresses the issueof whether ``sales'' to related parties should be included in the calculationof home market viability. Furthermore, it is our normal practice to includerelated party sales for purposes of determining home market viability.That is not to say, however, that the inclusion of related party salesin the viability calculation indicates that such sales are necessarilyat arm's length. During verification, the Department discovered problems with NMB/PelmecThai's home market database, such as the inclusion of cancelled sales,sales actually found to be made to Singapore, and sales made to its relatedbonded warehouses (<T3>see DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 11 </T3>above). The exclusion of these sales rendered the homemarket non-viable. In addition, NMB/Pelmec Thai was not able to demonstrateat verification that the home market sales to related parties were arm's-lengthtransactions because there were no sales of the same products to unrelatedparties to serve as a basis for comparison. In the absence of a viable home market, the Department prefers the useof third country data over constructed value. However, because we did notdiscover until verification that the home market was not viable, we wereunable to obtain third country prices. Therefore, we have relied on theverified constructed value data, as best information available, to calculateforeign market value. <T3>Comment 15. </T3>Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Thai divided itsdomestic sales volume (based on purchase order date) by its third countrysales volume (based on shipment date) to calculate home market viability.Petitioner contends that for purposes of determining whether the Thai homemarket is viable, home market and third country sales should be comparedon a consistent basis. Therefore, for purposes of the final determination,the Department should base the calculation of home market viability onthe sales data reported in the Section A deficiency response, as domesticand third country sales are comparably reported. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For the reasons set forth in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 11 </T3>above, we have determined that the Thai home marketwas not viable. Therefore, this issue need not be addressed. <T3>Comment 16. </T3>Petitioner contends that the home market in Thailandis not viable and, therefore, the Department should apply the special rulefor multinational corporations (MNC provision) for the final determination,in accordance with section 1677b(e) of the Act. Petitioner maintains thatit has demonstrated all three elements required to trigger the applicationof the MNC provision and, therefore, the use of third country prices isthe appropriate basis for foreign market value. However, since the Departmenthas not verified third country sales data, petitioner argues that the bestsurrogate for Minebea Japan's prices is the highest Japanese price forpart numbers identical to U.S. part numbers sold by another manufacturerin Japan as identified in the petition. If the Department does not applythe MNC provision, petitioner argues that constructed value should be usedas best information available. NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that the MNC provision does not apply becausethe Thai home market is viable, and because petitioner failed to establishthat the foreign market value of merchandise produced outside of Thailandis higher than the foreign market value of the merchandise produced inThailand. Neither the Japan prices based on Torrington's market researchnor the prices charged by Koyo Seiko, which were used by petitioner todemonstrate this condition, relate to the foreign market value of suchor similar merchandise in one or more of the facilities outside the countryof exportation as required by section 773(d) of the Act. The statute requiresa showing relating to the foreign market value of merchandise producedin one or more of the facilities of the multinational corporation underinvestigation. Neither the general Japanese prices based on Torrington'smarket research nor the prices of Koyo Seiko which were provided by petitionerare sufficient because they do not concern the merchandise produced bythe Minebea company. Moreover, the Japanese price data provided by petitionerindicate that the prices charged by NMB/Pelmec Thai are actually <T3>higher </T3>than the prices charged in Japan. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with respondent. To invoke the MNC provision,the petitioner must satisfy three criteria. Specifically, the petitionermust demonstrate that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) merchandise exported to the United States is being produced infacilities which are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by aperson, firm or corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly,other facilities for the production of such or similar merchandise whichare located in another country or countries; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) the sales of such or similar merchandise by the company concernedin the home market of the exporting country are nonexistent or inadequateas a basis for comparison with the sales of the merchandise to the UnitedStates; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>the foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced inone or more facilities outside the country of exportation </T3>is higherthan the foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced inthe facilities located in the country of exportation * * *</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">19 U.S.C. 1677(b)(d). Petitioner failed to satisfy the third criterion of the MNC provision.Under the third prong, petitioner is required to demonstrate that the foreignmarket value of such or similar merchandise produced in Minebea's facilitieslocated in Japan or Singapore is higher than the foreign market value ofsuch or similar merchandise produced in the Minebea facilities locatedin Thailand. The information provided by petitioner_Japanese prices basedon Torrington's market research and prices charged by Koyo Seiko_is notadequate to satisfy this requirement. Accordingly, we have determined thatthe MNC provision is not applicable in this case. Because the Thai home market was found to be non-viable for the reasonsset forth in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 11 </T3>above, we believe that third country prices are themost appropriate basis for establishing foreign market value. However,in the absence of third country data, we have used verified constructedvalue information to establish foreign market value, as best informationavailable. Because we have determined that the MNC provision does not apply in thiscase, the remainder of petitioner's and respondent's contentions relatingto the MNC provision need not be addressed.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 6. Alternative Reporting Requirements </ITAG>At the outset of these investigations, it became apparent that becauseof the sheer number of transactions involved and the complexity of theissues, the Department would have to depart from its standard proceduresfor handling antidumping investigations in order to complete these casesin a fair and timely manner. In making our initial decisions with respectto the classes or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigationsand the specific products covered by the scope of these investigations,we became fully cognizant of the vast number of bearing types and the immensecomplexity of making product comparisons. Subsequent to our questionnairepresentations, virtually all respondents notified the Department that theseinvestigations posed an unusually burdensome task for all parties involved.For example, one respondent noted that it produced over 30,000 differentproducts regularly and many thousands more specialty products. Anotherrespondent informed us that its transactions alone would number in thehundreds of thousands. Other respondents indicated that over 500,000 transactionswould have to be reported. In addition to the enormous amount of informationthat would be required and the short deadlines (even with extensions),identifying the most similar merchandise under our normal requirementsand verifying that the most similar merchandise had been reported by therespondents would have been an overwhelming task. Therefore, on July 15, 1988, we solicited the views of all parties to theproceedings concerning alternative reporting requirements. After consideringthe problems and the views of the parties to these proceedings, the Departmentconcluded that one method of ensuring that these investigations could becompleted in a fair and timely manner would be to reduce the sales reportingrequirements for respondents. The statute itself does not establish any particular reporting or coveragerequirements for fair value investigations. <T3>Cf., British Steel Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 8 CIT 86, 93-94 (1984), <T3>quoting from American Spring Wire Corp.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 8 CIT 20 (1984). By regulation, the Department``normally seeks to examine at least 60 percent of the dollar volume ofexports to the United States from any country subject to an antidumpingduty investigation.'' 19 CFR 353.38. However, as the regulation expresslyprovides, the 60 percent standard is a ``normal'' requirement, and theDepartment has the authority under the regulation to examine a lower percentagewhere the circumstances so warrant. For the reasons described above, the Department concluded that it wouldnot be feasible to examine 60 percent of the exports involved in theseproceedings. Therefore, the Department decided that it would examine atleast 33 percent of the volume of exports to the United States for eachclass or kind of merchandise. This would allow the Department to completethese investigations on time, while also providing a sufficiently largedata base to avoid undue distortions in the results of the Department'sanalysis. In order to achieve the goal of at least 33 percent coverage, the Departmentadopted the following methods. First, for each respondent, the Departmentattempted to compare only those products sold in the United States forwhich there were sales of identical merchandise in the market used to determineforeign market value. If the U.S. sales of these identical products accountedfor at least 33 percent of the exports of a particular respondent, theDepartment limited its comparisons to all identical matches. If such acomparison failed to account for 33 percent coverage, the Department thencompared the largest volume of products sold in the United States for whichthere were no identical matches, but for which there were sales of similarmerchandise in the relevant foreign market. The Department repeated thislast step until the 33 percent threshold was satisfied. <T3>Comment 1.</T3> Several respondents contend that the Department mustexclude from its LTFV calculations, sales of finished bearings manufacturedor assembled in the United States that contain imported components. INA,NSK, and FAG argue that the value added in the United States is so significantthat the finished bearings containing imported components are substantiallytransformed and become products of the United States. NSK further contendsthat its U.S. facilities contribute the ``essential characteristics'' tothe finished antifriction bearings. Accordingly, sales of these bearingsshould be excluded from these investigations. INA contends that it is not necessary for the Department to calculate LTFVmargins for imported components where, as in these investigations, importsof these components will be covered by the Department's findings regardingsales of finished bearings and components sold directly to unrelated customerswithout further manufacture or assembly. INA and NTN contend that, if the Department does calculate LTFV marginsfor imported components, the Department is required by section 772(e)(3)of the Act, the Department's regulations and past practice, to deduct theU.S. value added when the related party in the United States performs furthermanufacturing on, or assembly with, the imported product. In the instantcase, however, the Department's own actions preclude the use of the requiredmethodology in determining exporter's sales price since the Departmentdid not request the cost data necessary to make the required comparisons.NTN argues that it is unlawful for the Department to calculate dumpingmargins on merchandise manufactured in the United States or on importedcomponents which are not sold to an unrelated purchaser in the United States.Petitioner believes that the proper method for determining margins on componentsused by a related U.S. subsidiary of finished bearings is to deduct allvalue added in the United States to arrive at a proxy import price forthe component that is based on actual prices in the United States, citing19 U.S.C. 1677a(e)(3). Since the Department does not have the requisite information to perform such a calculation, however, petitioner arguesthat the Department should either perform a margin analysis based on salesof the same components to unrelated U.S. purchasers or to assign salesof components the same margins found on the class or kind of completedbearing to which the component belongs. With respect to the Japanese respondents,petitioner argues that use of the U.S. price of a finished bearing, albeitfinished in the United States, as compared to the foreign market valueof an identical finished bearing provides a reasonable basis for comparison.Petitioner also suggests with respect to the Japanese respondents, that,given the fact that the Department does not have information on the valueadded in the United States, it ought to take a ``best information available''approach to the U.S. sales of merchandise finished from imported parts.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> As stated above, because of the massive number oftransactions involved in these proceedings and the complexity of the investigations,the Department departed from its normal reporting requirements and soughtat least 33 percent coverage of the merchandise under investigation. Tofacilitate the achievement of this goal, the Department decided that, whereU.S. subsidiaries of foreign bearings producers imported components andparts to be assembled before sale to an unrelated customer in the UnitedStates, the respondents needed only to report (1) the price of the assembledbearing as sold to the unrelated customer, and (2) the price of an identicalbearing sold in the relevant foreign market. In other words, the respondentsdid not have to deduct the value added in the United States to arrive ata ``constructed'' U.S. price of the components and parts in their conditionas imported. In reaching this decision, the Department considered the fact that fairvalue investigations, such as these, result only in an estimate of thedumping margins, if any, that exist. 19 U.S.C. 1673e(a)(3). As the U.S.Court of International Trade acknowledged in a decision upholding the Department'suse of regression analysis (rather than standard arithmetical techniques)for purposes of a fair value determination, ``It was clearly the intentionof Congress to give Commerce flexibility at the fair value stages of itsinvestigation.'' <T3>Southwest Florida Winter Vegetable Growers Ass'n</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 584 F. Supp. 10, 17 (Ct. 9 Int,l Trade 1984),citing <T3>F.W. Myers andamp; Co.</T3> v.<T3> United States,</T3> 376 F. Supp. 860, 878 (Cust. Ct. 1974). Moreover,it is not clear that in the context of these proceedings, a deduction ofU.S. value added would be required even if these were not fair value investigations.In view of the greater methodological flexibility possessed by the Departmentat the investigatory stage of a proceeding, the Department reasoned thatprice-to-price comparisons based upon bearings in their condition as soldin the United States (rather than in their condition as imported) wouldprovide a reasonable estimate of the dumping margins that would have beencalculated if the Department had ``backed out'' the value added in theUnited States and compared the ``constructed'' price of a component orpart to the price of that same component or part in the relevant foreignmarket. Furthermore, by not requiring respondents to report the merchandiseas imported and the myriad costs involved in further manufacturing theproduct in the United States, we reduced the reporting burden on respondents.Moreover, by avoiding the difficult and time-consuming analysis and verificationinvolved in value-added deductions, the Department would be able to completethese investigations within the statutory deadlines.Respondents have made a number of factual arguments to the effect thatin certain instances substantial value has been added to imported componentsand parts prior to the first sale to an unrelated customer in the UnitedStates. We agree that there may be situations where the amount of valueadded in the United States is so substantial as to render the merchandiseoutside the scope of these proceedings. See, <T3>e.g., Expanded Metal of Base Metal from Japan, </T3>48 FR 5394 (1983);and <T3>Roller Chain from Japan, </T3>48 FR 51801 (1983). However, decisionsto exclude merchandise in these types of situations are very fact-specific.Because of our initial decision to compare merchandise on an ``as sold''basis, we did not request or verify information concerning value addedin the United States. Thus, at this point in these proceedings, we areunable to evaluate respondents' contentions that certain items of merchandiseshould be excluded from coverage. However, we are concerned that our initial approach could rely on an analysisof sales of merchandise not covered by these proceedings. Moreover, wherethe costs incurred in adding value in the United States were significantor differed significantly from similar costs that would have been incurredin the home market, not deducting U.S. value added could skew the dumpingcalculations considerably. Therefore, for purposes of these final determinations,we have excluded from our calculations all ESP sales of bearings with valuedadded in the United States. Although in some instances this decision hasprevented us from achieving our initial 33 percent threshold, we believethat the remaining sales provide an adequate basis for a final determination.The fact that we have excluded ESP value-added sales from our calculationsdoes not mean that the imported merchandise involved in such sales is excludedfrom the scope of these proceedings. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>GMN requests that the Department abandon the ``identicalsales match'' sampling technique and compute margins based on all of GMN'sU.S. sales. GMN argues that application of this identical sales match approachto GMN is contrary to U.S. law and the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade in that it yields unrepresentative and unfair results for GMN. Inparticular, GMN contends that application of the identical sales matchsampling results in an analysis which limits sales comparisons to productsat the low end of the company's product line and excludes most of the moresophisticated products, such as its high precision spindle and machinetool bearings, which represent the bulk of its sales revenue. Petitioner initially cautioned the Department that the ``33 percent identical''option could lead to skewed results, and that it might result in over-representationof everyday commodity bearings which would drive down the margins. Therefore,petitioner urged the Department to compare all sales in the U.S. marketwherever possible to determine whether sales were made at less than fairvalue (LTFV). However, petitioner now supports the uniform applicationof the 33 percent reporting requirement to all respondents. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We are following the alternative reporting requirementdescribed above. We agree with petitioner that it would be improper totreat GMN differently from any other respondent. As petitioner's counselstated at the FRG hearing, ``once an agency adopts an approach, it cannotpermit those who believe a different approach would be of benefit to themto step forward seeking such benefit.'' (<T3>See </T3>Transcript of Proceedings, Hearing on the Antidumping Investigationof Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and PartsThereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, February 22, 1989 at 157.)Furthermore, we note that over 70 percent by volume of GMN's U.S. saleswere examined for purposes of calculating the LTFV margins. We have noreason to believe that a ``representative sample'' would be better achievedby capturing those products representing the bulk of sales revenue ratherthan volume sold. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 7: Critical Circumstances </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>When deciding whether there have been massive importsfor purposes of making its critical circumstances determinations, petitionerargues generally that the Department should follow the methodology outlinedin its CVD regulations. At one point the petitioner argues that these regulationsindicate that the Department should compare the period three months beforethe initiation to the period three months after the initiation, while atanother point, petitioner argues that the regulation should be viewed morebroadly as meaning the Department should examine the seven month periodbetween the initiation and the preliminary determination in antidumpingproceedings. The SKF Group companies and GMN argue that the Department should make itsmassive imports determination based on the seven-month period between initiationand the preliminary determination. In addition, FAG-FRG, FAG-Italy, andNTN also emphasize that the Department must not limit itself to lookingat just this period, but must also consider historical trends and sporadicshipment levels. Finally, INA-FRG and NTN argue that the Department musttake into consideration the increased demand for AFBs during this period.If imports increase simply in response to increased demand, the Departmentshould not find critical circumstances to exist. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In determining whether there have been massive importsin these investigations, the Department has compared the seven-month periodafter the filing of the petition to the seven-month period prior to thepetition's filing. This period, running from April through October, representsthe months from the beginning of the investigations until the preliminarydeterminations. We have chosen this time period because it is the periodin which respondents could take advantage of their knowledge of the dumpinginvestigations to increase exports to the United States without being subjectto antidumping duties. (<T3>See, Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan,</T3>53 FR 12552, 12566 (1988). As stated in the ``Critical Circumstances'' section of each notice, wheremassive imports were found to exist, we also examined shipment data toensure that the increase in shipments did not simply reflect historicaltrends. The historical data did not indicate any trends, such as regularseasonal increases in shipments, that would lead one to expect that Aprilthrough October shipments would consistently be greater than Septemberthrough March shipments. In fact, in many cases, data from 1986 and 1987indicated that April-October shipments actually dropped in comparison toSeptember-March shipments. Thus, there was no distinct pattern of seasonalityin any case. Although some increases in April-October shipments to the United Statesmay have been tied to increased demand, there was no consistent increasein shipments from one company or country within a particular class or kindof merchandise. Again, neither our data nor the information provided bythe respondents shows with any degree of certainty that the increase inshipments can be explained by greater demand.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>FAG-FRG argues that, given the original scope of thepetition covered only one class or kind of merchandise, it is inappropriateto base the critical circumstances determination on five classes or kindsof merchandise until such time as the Department made public its divisionof the subject merchandise into five classes or kinds. FAG-FRG states that733(e)(1)(A) of the Act expressly provides that critical circumstancesbe determined with respect to the ``class or kind of merchandise whichis subject to the investigation.'' Therefore, because the fair value investigationcovered only one class or kind of merchandise until July 13, 1988, whethercritical circumstances exist, at least until that date, can only fairlybe considered with respect to that class or kind, not with respect to thefive classes or kinds which did not exist as investigative entities untilthat date. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The purpose of the critical circumstances provisionis to deter exporters whose merchandise is subject to an investigationfrom circumventing the antidumping duty law by increasing exports to theUnited States during the period between initiation of an investigationand the preliminary determination so as to avoid possible duties. At thetime of initiation, the scope of these investigations included all AFBs(except tapered roller bearings) from the FRG and eight other countries.Once we announced our initiation, FAG-FRG was on notice that any massiveincrease in exports of AFBs prior to a preliminary determination wouldbe potentially subject to antidumping duties. The fact that we later subdividedthe merchandise subject to investigation into five classes or kinds ofmerchandise did not expand the breadth of the investigations. We are directedto make a critical circumstances determination with respect to each classor kind of merchandise. Since we determined that AFBs consist of five classesor kinds of merchandise, it does not make sense to determine critical circumstancesbased on aggregate figures for all five classes or kinds. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>INA-FRG suggests that the Department should examinethe level of imports in terms of volume and value. When examined in termsof value, INA-FRG contends that the value of its imports decreased in thepost-initiation period as compared to the corresponding time period precedingthe initiation. RHP also contends that the Department should consider the value and volumeof its imports in determining whether there have been massive imports overa relatively short period of time. RHP argues that the examination of itsimport value data, particularly with respect to cylindrical roller bearingsis appropriate in this investigation since volume figures may be distortedby imports of loose bearing components, especially loose balls and rollers.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree that the use of import volume in some instancesmay create some distortions. However, if imports prior to the initiationof the investigations included components and finished bearings and thesame product mix was maintained after initiation, the use of volume datawould not distort the measurement. Moreover, the use of value data potentiallycauses many of the same distortions as the use of volume data, especiallywhen it reflects imports of potentially dumped or unusually expensive products.INA-FRG and RHP have failed to provide compelling evidence that value datais a better indication of massive imports, nor have they shown that importvolume information is so distortive as to constitute an unreasonable measurefor purposes of determining massive imports. <T3>Comment 4. </T3>INA-FRG submits that it has eliminated a distortionin its data by reporting discrete rolling elements as single units sincethey are sold in increments of 1,000 pieces and by adjusting the previouslysubmitted monthly data so as to more accurately reflect the level of shipments.As such, INA-FRG states, the adjusted data shows that there have been decreasesin each product category during the period of comparison. INA-FRG contendsthat the Department should use the adjusted data in making its criticalcircumstances determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>INA-FRG submitted new critical circumstances dataas an exhibit to its post-verification brief and as such it constitutesnew, unverified information. Although we were able to verify INA-FRG'sdata submitted prior to the preliminary determinations, these data didnot include September and October 1988 shipments. Therefore, in accordancewith section 776(c) of the Act, we are assuming that imports of all classesor kinds of merchandise from INA-FRG have been massive over a relativelyshort period of time as best information available. (<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of the FRG Notice.)<T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioner contends that because the Department wasunable to verify either the critical circumstances data submitted priorverification or the data submitted after verification, the quantities andvalues reported by SKF Group companies should not be used as the basisfor the final determination. Petitioner argues that the Department shoulduse the information provided by petitioner as the best information availableand determine that critical circumstances exist with respect to all bearingsfrom SKF Group companies. SKF Group companies contend that the Department should base its criticalcircumstances decision on the best information available, which it assertsis the data it submitted showing the volume of entries of AFBs into theUnited States. The shipment data previously submitted by SKF Group companiesreflects shipments of outstanding orders placed prior to the initiationof these investigations and are not the best measure of entry of imports.Furthermore, SKF Group companies contends that it is illogical to assessthe impact of goods that have not entered the United States. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department routinely asks for shipment datarather than entry data for critical circumstances due to the fact thatin purchase price situations, the exporter often does not know the datethe merchandise enters the United States. In response to our August 23,1988 request, SKF Group companies provided monthly shipment data. It wasonly on January 4, 1989, four days prior to the ESP verification, thatSKF Group companies provided entry data along with its argument that entrydata is superior to shipment data for the purposes of a massive importsdetermination. Moreover, SKF Group companies did not present any meaningfuldata to demonstrate that entry data results in a substantially differentpicture of the pattern of imports after initiation than shipment data.Therefore, we believe that SKF Group companies shipment data is the bestmeasure of whether imports have been massive over a relatively short periodof time. We were, however, unable to verify SKF Group companies shipmentdata. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, as best informationavailable, we are assuming that imports of all classes or kinds of merchandisefrom SKF Group companies have been massive over a relatively short periodof time. <T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner argues that, since SKF companies in theFRG and Sweden have admitted that the U.S. sales of ball bearings theyhave reported could include ``support production'' sales of ball bearingsthat they did not manufacture, the import figures from SKF-UK will notbe accurate. Therefore, petitioner argues, the Department should use bestinformation available and find critical circumstances as to the SKF Groupcompanies' ball bearings imports from all the countries subject to theseinvestigations. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> For reasons other than ``support production,'' wewere unable to verify SKF Group companies' import shipment data for thesubject merchandise. Therefore, as best information available, we are assumingthat imports of all classes or kinds of merchandise from SKF Group companieshave been massive over a relatively short period of time. (<T3>See, </T3>Miscellaneous section of this Appendix and the Critical Circumstancessection in the FRG, France, Italy, Sweden and the U.K. Notices.) <T3>Comment 7.</T3> SKF Group companies contend that the Department erroneouslyfound critical circumstances existed with respect to spherical plain bearingsfrom SKF-FRG and ball bearings from SKF-Italy, despite the fact that petitionernever alleged critical circumstances with respect to spherical plain bearingsfrom the FRG or ball bearings from Italy. SKF Group companies submit thatsince the Department repeatedly has rejected the sufficiency of a singlesales at less than fair value allegation for all AFBs and for sales beingmade below the cost of production, it cannot accept critical circumstancesallegations that are not specific to a class or kind of merchandise. Asthere is no allegation, SKF Group companies state that there is no statutorybasis for these determinations and they should be rescinded for the finaldeterminations. Petitioner contends that its critical circumstances allegations apply toall such or similar categories of AFBs imported from the FRG and ltaly.Furthermore, petitioner contends that critical circumstances allegationswere made with respect to all AFBs since it continues to believe that AFBsconstitute one class or kind of merchandise. Petitioner further arguesthat with respect to spherical plain bearings, the import statistics availablewere basket TSUSA categories which contain a number of products not subjectto these investigations. Petitioner states that the submission includedinformation on all imports of AFBs from the FRG and Italy, which by definitionincluded spherical plain bearings and ball bearings. Petitioner concludesthat, in light of these facts, the Department has the authority to makean affirmative critical circumstances determination regarding sphericalplain bearings from the FRG and ball bearings from Italy. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree that the plain language of the statuteand its legislative history require that a determination of critical circumstancescan be triggered only upon the allegation of the petitioner. However, wehave determined that petitioner made an adequate allegation of criticalcircumstances with respect to spherical plain bearings from the FRG andball bearings from Italy. In its submission of August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged critical circumstanceswith respect to all AFBs due to its continued belief that AFBs constitutea single class or kind of merchandise. In support of its allegations, petitionerprovided information on particular classes or kinds of AFBs, where importstatistics permitted such a breakdown. Simply put, in its August 1, 1988submission, petitioner supported its allegation of critical circumstanceswith all information reasonably available to it. Therefore, the Departmentrequested and received critical circumstances data concerning all classesor kinds of merchandise under investigation. Based on submitted data andin some instances the best information available, the Department preliminarilydetermined, pursuant to section 733(e) of the Act, that there was a reasonablebasis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances existed with respectto ball bearings from Italy and spherical plain bearings from the FRG.Any ambiguity as to petitioner's allegation regarding ball bearings fromItaly and spherical plain bearings from the FRG was eliminated in the FRG'spost-hearing brief and in its March 7, 1989 clarification. Here petitionerconfirmed its intent to include ball bearings from Italy and sphericalplain bearings from the FRG within its critical circumstances allegationsof August l, 1988. Therefore, since petitioner has made a critical circumstancesallegation with respect to ball bearings from Italy and spherical plainbearings from the FRG, we are required, pursuant to section 735(a)(3) ofthe Act, to determine whether critical circumstances exist with respectto this merchandise. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner contends that, because SKF-USA cannot segregateits bearings by country of origin, the Department should determine on thebasis of best information available that critical circumstances exist withrespect to all classes or kinds of merchandise from the FRG, Italy, Sweden,and the UK. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For reasons other than SKF-USA's country of originassignment methodology, we have determined, however, not to use SKF Groupcompanies' data for purposes of our critical circumstances determinationsas we were unable to verify the import shipment data provided, and haveassumed massive imports as the best information available in accordancewith section 776(c) of the Act. (<T3>See, </T3>Miscellaneous section in this Appendix B and the CriticalCircumstances section in the FRG, France, Italy, Sweden, and the UK Notices.)<T3>Comment 9. </T3>Petitioner argues that as Koyo's response has beenrejected without verification, and the figures cannot be relied upon forthe purposes of the final determinations, the Department should renderan affirmative critical circumstances determination with respect to Koyoon all product groups. Koyo argues that although its questionnaire response was not verified,the data provided are the best information available to assess petitioner'sclaim of critical circumstances. Koyo argues that shipments of needle rollerbearings and cylindrical roller bearings decreased and shipments of ballbearings increased only slightly in the three-month period immediatelyfollowing the filing of the petition. Koyo contends that shipments of sphericalroller bearings did increase significantly in the later period, but thisincrease is solely a function of the fact that imports of spherical rollerbearings are miniscule. Koyo argues that any increase in import volumeis accounted for by the strong demand of U.S. user industries and the inabilityof the U.S. bearings industry to meet that demand. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For reasons previously discussed, we have determinedto use best information available with respect to Koyo. (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available section of this Appendix.) Therefore,as best information available, we are assuming that imports of the allclasses or kinds of merchandise from Koyo have been massive over a relativelyshort period of time. (<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of the Japan Notice.) <T3>Comment 10. </T3>Petitioner argues that because Minebea's sales figuresdid not include rod end bearings and other bearings it considers airframecomponents, Minebea's data cannot be relied upon as the basis for the Department'scritical circumstances determination. Accordingly, petitioner contendsthat, as best information available, the Department should make an affirmativecritical circumstances determination with respect to Minebea Japan's exportsof spherical plain bearings. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Because Minebea Japan failed to report all salesof spherical plain bearings, the monthly shipment data verified for purposesof our critical circumstances determination was not complete. In the absenceof complete and verified data, we are unable to determine whether MinebeaJapan's imports of spherical plain bearings from Japan have been massiveover a relatively short period of time. Accordingly, as best informationavailable, we have determined that imports of spherical plain bearingshave been massive over a relatively short period of time. (<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of the Japan Notice.) <T3>Comment 11. </T3>Minebea Japan contends that critical circumstancesdo not exist and with respect to its ball bearing exports because the quantityand value of such exports are negligible. Minebea Japan also contends thatthe Department verified the total quantity and value of ball bearing exportsto the United States during the POI. Moreover, Minebea Japan states thatits exports of ball bearings decreased during the six-month period followingthe filing of the petition. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Minebea Japan chose not to report any informationon ball bearings from Japan. During verification, as part of our salesverification, we verified the total quantity and value of ball bearingsexported to the United States during the POI. However, Minebea did notprovide, nor did we verify, monthly shipment data for the period used forcritical circumstances purposes_between the date of initiation and thepreliminary determinations. Therefore, as best information available, weare assuming that imports of ball bearings from Minebea Japan have beenmassive over a relatively short period of time. (<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of the Japan Notice.) <T3>Comment 12. </T3>Petitioner submits that since TIE's shipments madein July, August, September, and October were not reported or verified,these data for spherical roller and ball bearings should be rejected andan affirmative critical circumstances determination made based on the bestinformation otherwise available. TIE contends that the Department incorrectly found that critical circumstancesexisted for the preliminary determination. TIE states that since certainclarifications have been provided and verified, the Department should rendera negative final determination with regard to critical circumstances. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have determined that the information providedat verification constitutes a minor revision to TIE's original submissionof shipment data and that TIE's critical circumstances response verified.Thus, we are using TIE's verified data for the purposes of determiningwhether or not imports from TIE have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time. (<T3>See, </T3>Critical Circumstances section of the Romania Notice.) <T3>Comment 13. </T3>Petitioner contends that, based on unverified datafrom INA-UK, the Department should determine that there have been massiveimports. Furthermore, petitioner argues that, based on the size of themargins calculated, the Department should impute knowledge to the importerand issue affirmative critical circumstances determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For reasons previously discussed, we have determinedto use best information available with respect to INA-UK. (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available section of this Appendix.) Therefore,as best information available, we are likewise assuming that imports ofneedle roller bearings from INA-UK have been massive over a relativelyshort period of time. (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available section of this Appendix and CriticalCircumstances section of the UK Notice.)<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 8: Administrative Protective Order Issues </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner argues that the following respondents' submissionsshould be rejected by the Department because the public and administrativeprotective order (APO) versions were in direct violation of the Department'sregulations: INA-France; SKF-France; SKF-UK; FAG-FRG; and NTN-Japan. Petitionercontends that the failure of these respondents to submit adequate publicand APO versions of their submissions has prevented the domestic industry(specifically, petitioner's in-house counsel and accounting experts) andits counsel from knowing the full extent and significance of respondents'claims and from addressing these allegations on the record. With regard to SKF-France, petitioner alleges that respondent's failureto provide adequate public versions of its responses materially contributedto the Department's decision not to reinitiate a cost of production investigationwith regard to spherical roller bearings. With regard to NTN-Japan, petitioner argues that NTN has refused to providepublic summaries of virtually all numerical information submitted and thatNTN has not identified its part numbers despite the fact that its U.S.and home market catalogues are in the public domain and are part of thepublic record in these investigations. SKF contends that a review of the voluminous submissions of all SKF companiesshows that every document is accompanied by an adequate public summaryof the proprietary information or a complete explanation as to the lackof susceptibility to summarization. SKF argues that the nature of the datafor which SKF requested proprietary treatment meets the Department's standardsfor confidentiality and that SKF has complied with the law governing accessto information. With regard to adequate APO versions, SKF maintains thatthe Department's February 17, 1989 determination, which ordered the releaseof contested information, renders moot petitioner's argument regardingthe adequacy of those versions. SKF holds that the Department should useSKF's submitted information and dismiss the petitioner's claims as unfounded.NTN states that the Department has acted properly in accepting NTN's publicversions of its various responses. NTN argues that it has complied withthe Department's requests in instances where the Department has requesteda revised public summary or an explanation as to why data is not capableof summarization. Finally, NTN argues that the Department accepted thesame types of public summaries as presented in the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan </T3>(52FR 30700, October 17, 1987). <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department's determinations on the adequacyof the public summaries in these investigations are in accordance withthe law given the voluminous nature of the submissions made in these investigationsby all parties and the extraordinarily complicated nature of these investigations.The rights of all parties were adequately protected in these investigations.We do not agree with petitioner's contention that SKF's and NTN's submissionsshould be rejected because of a lack of access to proprietary informationand that the Department should use the best information available for itsfinal determinations. With the exception of customer or supplier namesor identifiers, sources of information, verification exhibits and tradesecrets, petitioner's counsel received access to all business proprietaryinformation, including the computer tapes, under administrative protectiveorders (APO) issued by the Department. Any objections to the Department'sdecisions not to release certain limited information had to be taken tothe Court of International Trade within ten days of that decision. 19 U.S.C.1677f(c)(2).We do not agree with petitioner's contention that respondent's failureto provide sufficient public versions of its responses for SKF-France materiallycontributed to the Department's decision not to reinitiate a cost of productioninvestigation with regard to spherical roller bearings. This contentionis not justified because our determination was based upon the relevantinformation of record. In this instance, the information of record showedthat the Department had no basis upon which to initiate a cost of productioninvestigation with respect to spherical roller bearings since the productson which petitioner's allegation was based were not sold in the home marketduring the period of investigation. The perceived lack of access by petitionerto a sufficient public summary of proprietary data would not have affectedthe Department's determination. Furthermore, we agree with counsel for SKF that the Department's February17, 1989 decision memorandum, which determined that the information shouldbe released under APO, renders moot petitioner's arguments regarding theadequacy of SKF's APO versions of submissions. As a result of this determination,SKF provided petitioner access to all of the contested information. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should abandonits past practice of not releasing verification exhibits and release theverification exhibits in these investigations under section 1332 of theOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Petitioner contends thatthe Congress intended for the release of verification exhibits. Nachi and NTN claim that verification exhibits should not be released topetitioner, and argue that section 1332 of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988 does not apply to this investigation. Nachi states that thelegislative history of the 1988 Act shows that Congress did not intendthat the Department release to the petitioner's counsel all of the businessproprietary data which it collects in an investigation. Nachi and NTN arguethat the verification exhibits are not obtained as submissions of new information,but rather are collected by the Department solely for its convenience,and to verify data already on the record. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In these investigations, we denied the release ofthe verification exhibits pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1677f(c) in the Department'sdecision memorandum dated December 2, 1988. Petitioner did not challengethis decision in the Court within ten days and therefore the decision isfinal. The issue is moot and we will therefore not address it here. <T3>Comments 3. </T3>Koyo contends that the divulging of APO material bypetitioner's counsel in this case, however unintentional, calls into questionthe adequacy of petitioner's safeguard procedures. The Department shouldconsider applying appropriate sanctions, and, at the very least, view counsel'scontinuing efforts to expand the frontiers of access with renewed skepticism.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department views any allegation or violationof an APO, inadvertent or otherwise, as a very serious matter. The Departmenthas established procedures as set forth in 19 CFR Parts 353, 354 and 355entitled ``Procedures For Imposing Sanctions for Violation of an Antidumpingor Countervailing Duty Protective Order.'' Any allegation concerning anAPO violation is considered separately from the administrative proceeding.Other Issues<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 9: Best Information Available </ITAG>To determine whether sales of AFBs from the FRG, France, Italy, Japan,Sweden, and the U.K. were made at less than fair value, we compared theUnited States price to the foreign market value as discussed in the <T3>Fair Value Comparisons</T3> section of each notice. For the reasonscited below and in the comment portion of this section, we have determined,in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the total or partialuse of best information available is appropriate for certain classes orkinds of the subject merchandise from INA-FRG, INA-U.K., Koyo, MinebeaJapan, SKF-FRG, SKF-France, SKF-Italy, and SKF-Sweden. Section 776(c) requiresthe Department to use the best information available ``whenever a partyor any other person refuses or is unable to produce information requestedin a timely manner or in the form required, or otherwise significantlyimpedes an investigation.'' In deciding what to use as best information available, the Department'sregulations provide that the Department may take into account whether aparty refuses to provide requested information. 19 CFR 353.51(b). Thus,the Department may determine on a case-by-case basis what is the best informationavailable. For the purposes of these final determinations, we have appliedtwo tiers of best information available depending on whether the companiesattempted or refused to cooperate in these investigations. First, whena company refused to provide the information requested in the form required,or otherwise significantly impeded the Department's investigation, we determinedthat it is appropriate to assign to that company the highest margin forthe relevant class or kind of merchandise among (1) the margins in thepetition, (2) the highest calculated margin of any respondent within thatcountry that supplied adequate and verified responses for the relevantclass or kind of merchandise, or (3) the estimated margin found for theaffected company in the preliminary determination. We have applied thismethodology to the following companies for certain classes or kinds ofmerchandise for the reasons cited below and in the comment portion of thissection: INA-U.K., SKF-France, and Minebea Japan. Second, when a company has cooperated with our requests for informationbut failed to provide the information requested in a timely manner or inthe form required, we have determined that it is appropriate to assignthe affected company the higher margin for the relevant class or kind ofmerchandise between (1) the highest calculated margin for any respondentwithin that country that supplied adequate and verified responses for therelevant class or kind of merchandise, or (2) the estimated margin foundfor the affected company in the preliminary determination. However, inthe event the affected company is the only producer or exporter of therelevant class or kind of merchandise, we have determined that it is appropriateto assign the higher margin between (1) the estimated margin found forthe affected company in the preliminary determination, or (2) the marginin the petition. We applied this methodology to the following companiesfor certain classes or kinds of merchandise for the reasons cited belowand in the comment portion of this section: INA-FRG, Koyo, SKF-FRG, SKF-Italyand SKF-Sweden. The following discussion and comment section itemize the factual eventswith respect to each of the aforementioned companies:<T3>INA-U.K.</T3>: INA-U.K. informed the Department that it would not permitverification of its sales response. Furthermore, it did not respond toour cost of production questionnaire. Because of these actions, and inthe absence of verified information, we used the best information availableas described above. <T3>SKF-France: </T3>SKF-France did not report sales of spherical plainbearings sold during the POI. Despite numerous requests for information,SKF-France did not respond to our questionnaires with respect to this classor kind of merchandise. SKF-France contends that the products manufacturedat its Sarma facility are outside the scope of these investigations. Assuch, they did not report any sales of spherical plain bearings or rodends in either market during the POI. At verification, we confirmed thatthe unreported merchandise in question was spherical plain bearings androd ends, as defined by and contained within the scope of these investigations.Because of SKF-France's actions, we have used the best information availableas described above. <T3>Minebea Japan: </T3>Minebea Japan did not report sales of ball bearingsduring the POI and did not answer the Department's requests for informationregarding this class or kind of merchandise. Because of Minebea Japan'sactions, we are using the best information available as described above.<T3>Koyo: </T3>Immediately prior to the scheduled verification date, Koyosubmitted a new response which purportedly corrected a major error in itsearlier submissions as well as other deficiencies in the response thatthe Department had used for its preliminary determinations. The major erroraffected the U.S. matched sales listing, the home market matched saleslisting, the model match concordance, the constructed values, and the costof production data. Thus, the number of models reported and the numberof transactions submitted in the new response for each class or kind ofmerchandise changed drastically. The Department determined that the revisionssubmitted by Koyo were so substantial that such revisions constituted anew response. While the Department normally allows minor revisions to questionnaireresponses after the preliminary determination and during verification,it is our well established policy not to accept new responses that arefiled after the preliminary determination. In this case, the revisionsmade in the response were of such magnitude that the Department essentiallywould have had to recommence its investigation of Koyo at verification.This, in turn, would have denied the petitioner and other interested partiestheir statutorily mandated opportunity to comment on the new response andotherwise to participate in these investigations with regard to Koyo. Forthe aforementioned reasons, we have not accepted Koyo's November 9, 1988response for use in these determinations and, in the absence of verifiedinformation, we have used the best information available as described above.<T3>SKF-FRG, SKF-Italy and SKF-Sweden: </T3>Prior to the scheduled dateof verification, we received revised and new worksheets and sample calculationsfor numerous charges and adjustments related to home market sales for SKF-FRGand third country sales for SKF-Italy and SKF-Sweden. For some of the chargesand adjustments received, the Department determined that the necessaryrevisions to SKF's information were so substantial that such revisionsconstituted new information. While the Department allows minor revisionsto questionnaire responses after the preliminary determination and duringverification, it is a well established Department policy not to acceptnew information that is filed after the preliminary determination. <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Certain Internal-CombustionIndustrial Forklift Trucks from Japan, </T3>(53 FR 12552, April 13, 1988).Consequently, the Department informed SKF-FRG during verification thatit would not accept new submissions correcting the deficiencies and errorsnoted above. The Department nevertheless completed its sales and cost ofproduction verifications, as the new information provided did not appearto undermine the credibility of the entire database. However, during the course of verification, the Department found numerousdiscrepancies, errors in methodology and mathematical errors with respectto SKF-FRG home market sales and SKF-Italy and SKF-Sweden third countrysales. In addition, SKF-FRG was unable to provide supporting documentationto substantiate major portions of its home market and third country salesresponses at verification. The deficiencies found are outlined in detailin the public version of our verification report which is on file in roomB-099 of the Main Commerce building. Given the substantial number of discrepanciesand errors contained in the questionnaire responses, the magnitude of theproblems encountered at verification, and the submission of new unverifiedinformation subsequent to verification, we have used the best informationavailable for the purposes of our final determinations with respect toall classes or kinds of merchandise produced and sold by SKF-FRG and forthose classes or kinds of merchandise sold by SKF-Italy and SKF-Swedenfor which sales to the FRG were considered to be the most appropriate basisfor determining foreign market value.<T3>INA-FRG: </T3>With respect to INA-FRG, the Department found numerousdiscrepancies and errors in methodology and mathematical calculations atthe cost of production verification for cylindrical roller bearings. INA-FRGconsequently was unable to support substantial portions of its cost responseat verification. These deficiencies undermine the credibility of the entiredatabase. The deficiencies found are outlined in detail in the public versionof our verification report which is on file in room B-099 of the Main Commercebuilding. For these reasons, we have used the best information availablewith respect to cylindrical roller bearings produced and sold by INA-FRGfor the purposes of our final determinations as described above. <T3>Comment 1.</T3> Since INA-U.K. did not respond to Section D of ourquestionnaire and did not permit verification, petitioner contends thatthe Department should calculate best information available by taking intoconsideration the allegations that INA-U.K. is selling in the home marketat prices which are less than cost of production and the fact that INA-U.K.included improper allocations in its reporting of sales data. Specifically,petitioner states that the Department should adjust INA-U.K.'s home marketprices upwards to reflect the level of below cost sales alleged by petitionerand the statutory minimum profit in constructed value. Petitioner alsoargues that the Department should reject improper allocations of inlandfreight and packing expenses. Petitioner claims that since INA-U.K.'s responsewas not verified, no claimed adjustments should be allowed to foreign marketvalue and all claimed adjustments should be made to U.S. price. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> As discussed above with respect to INA-U.K., wehave applied best information available. We have not adopted petitioner'ssuggestion in this case that the margin should be further adjusted to reflectalleged below cost sales. Given the number of companies to which best informationavailable has been applied, we do not believe we should correct perceiveddeficiencies in the best information available rate we have applied. Ifwe were to do this for INA-U.K., we would then be required to correct perceiveddeficiencies in all other responses of the foreign manufacturers subjectto best information available. Therefore, we have assigned INA-U.K., asbest information available, its estimated margin for needle roller bearingsfound at the preliminary determination. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>Petitioner contends that the number and nature of deficienciesin SKF-France's response should lead the Department to reject that responsein its entirety and use the most adverse information otherwise availableas best information available. Specifically, petitioner claims that: (1)Inadequate public versions of the responses handicapped its participationin the investigation; (2). SKF-France's protective order versions of itsresponses were incomplete; and (3) the reported databases were incompletebecause sales of spherical plain bearings were not reported, country codingproblems may mean that reported sales were incomplete or included productsnot manufactured in France, purchase price sales were not adequately reported,sales by related parties were omitted from the home market sales listings,U.S. sales between September 28 and 30 were not reported, and a numberof sales were ``lost.'' SKF-France claims that during the verification the Department found nomajor discrepancies in the databases. The allegedly unreported sales ofspherical plain bearings were sales of products not within the scope ofthis investigation. Moreover, because petitioner's allegations of salesat less than fair value for spherical plain bearings were deficient, thebest information available supports the Department's preliminary negativedetermination on these products. Furthermore, SKF-France submits that with respect to the other claimeddeficiencies, the Department examined thoroughly the manner in which SKF'sU.S. sales were reported and verified that ``support production'' sales,<T3>i.e., </T3>sales by SKF-France of merchandise produced by SKF facilitiesin another country, were miniscule. The number of unreported purchase pricesales were <T3>de minimis </T3>and none had identical matches in the home market.Therefore, there was no reason to report them. Finally, the number of unreportedhome market sales by related parties, the number of U.S. sales of ballbearings by Sarma, and the number of ``lost sales'' were also <T3>de minimis, </T3>and could not in any way affect the estimated margins.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have determined that the deficiencies in SKF-France'sresponse are not so great as to require us to reject the response in itsentirety. Our views with respect to the adequacy of the public and protectiveorder responses are discussed in the ``Administrative Protective Ordersand Public Summarizations'' section of this Appendix. However, we agreewith petitioner that certain deficiencies in the response warrant the applicationof best information available, as discussed below. With respect to spherical plain bearings, we do not agree with SKF-Francethat these sales were of products outside the scope of the investigationor that petitioner's allegation of sales at less than fair value was deficientfor this product. Therefore, we have applied the estimated margin containedin the petition for spherical plain bearings as best information availablefor this class or kind of merchandise from SKF-France as discussed above.With respect to ball bearings and spherical roller bearings from SKF-France,we agree with petitioner that SKF incorrectly included sales to relatedparties rather than sales by those parties to the first unrelated customer.Because SKF-France did not demonstrate that the sales to related partieswere made at prices comparable to sales to unrelated parties, we have droppedthe sales to related parties from the home market database pursuant to19 CFR 353.22(b). In instances where deletion of those sales resulted indropping the percentage of U.S. sales for which identical sales were reportedbelow the 33 percent threshold, we have applied best information availablefor those sales to achieve the 33 percent threshold. We have used SKF-France'scalculated margin as best information available since this rate was higherthan the rate calculated for this class or kind of merchandise for anyother respondent in France. Regarding the other deficiencies claimed by petitioner, we closely examinedSKF's method for assigning U.S. sales to particular SKF-AFB manufacturingfacilities in Europe at verification. The Department's preference for determiningcountry of origin is on a sale-by-sale basis. However, given the mannerin which SKF-USA maintains its records and the enormous effort that wouldhave been required to establish definitively the SKF manufacturing facilitywhich produced the specific merchandise, we have determined that SKF'sassignment methodology is reasonable and accepted it for these investigations.We also reviewed carefully the problem of ``support production.'' Becausethe merchandise produced in another SKF facility would be sold at the sameprice that would be charged for merchandise produced by the SKF facilityin the country in question, and because the amounts of such sales wererelatively small, we have concluded for purposes of these investigationsthat their inclusion in the database does not distort the calculation offoreign market value. Therefore, we have determined it is appropriate toaccept SKF-France's response. Finally, with respect to the other omissions, we agree with SKF-Francethat these omissions are too minor to affect the antidumping margins forthe products concerned. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> Petitioner contends that, because Minebea Japan electednot to respond to the Department's questionnaire with respect to ball bearings,the Department is required to use best information available for the finaldetermination in accordance with section 776(c). Petitioner argues thatthe final dumping margin should be the highest rate alleged in the petitionfor Japan, which is 225.68 percent for spherical plain bearings. However,if the Department adheres to its decision that the subject merchandiseconstitutes five classes or kinds of merchandise, the dumping margin shouldbe the highest rate alleged in the petition for ball bearings from Japan,which is 106.61 percent. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Where a respondent has failed to respond to ourquestionnaire or otherwise cooperate with our investigation, we have usedbest information available as discussed above. Therefore, in the case ofball bearings from Minebea Japan, we have used the highest margin for ballbearings contained in the petition as best information available. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner argues that, using the best informationavailable, the Department should assign to Koyo by class or kind of merchandisethe higher of (1) the rate set forth in the petition or (2) the highestrate determined to exist for any other respondent. Koyo requests that,if the Department maintains its position to use best information availablefor the final determinations, it should use a less punitine form, givenKoyo's good-faith efforts in these investigations. It suggests that themost appropriate form would be to assign Koyo the ``All Other'' rate or,at worst, the highest rate determined to exist for any other respondent.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> Where a respondent has cooperated with our requestsfor information but was unable to provide the information requested ina timely manner or in the form required, we have used best informationavailable as discussed above. As a result, Koyo's attempts to cooperatewere properly recognized in our selection of the appropriate best informationavailable for each class or kind of merchandise. Therefore, in the caseof Koyo, we have used as best information available, for each class orkind of merchandise the higher of the following: the margin found for Koyoin the preliminary determination or the highest calculated margin for anyJapanese company that supplied adequate and verified responses. <T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioner supports the Department's decision to declineto verify Koyo's revised response, as the response submitted was deficientand the correct response was untimely.  Koyo contends that the Department should have verified the revised responseand used it for the purposes of the final determinations. Koyo argues thatthe Department had time to review the corrected response and verify it,as the Department extended the deadline for the final determinations bythe full 135 days. It also points to the fact that the Department had ampletime to verify Rose Bearings, which was not issued a questionnaire untilthe week before the preliminary determinations. Koyo concludes that theDepartment has not treated it equitably with respect to other respondents,as in the case of Rose Bearings. It also cites the Department's acceptanceof data from NSK, which made an error similar to Koyo's in product matches.Because NSK based its matches on product codes that in some instances includedcustomer-specific prefixes and bearing etching differences, NSK (like Koyo)did not report all of its identical sales. For these reasons Koyo contendsthat the Department should accept and use the information that it has provided.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree with Koyo. The Department maintainsits position that Koyo's submitted response was deficient and that itscorrected response was untimely. The magnitude of the changes in Koyo'sresponse was such that it would have required the Department to start overits investigation of Koyo after the preliminary determinations. For thisreason the Department rejected the response and decided to use best informationavailable for purposes of the final determinations.This decision is consistent with both the Department's general practiceand its approach in these investigations. In our concurrent investigationof AFBs from the U.K., it is true that Rose Bearings' response was filedand accepted after the preliminary determinations. The reason for thiswas that Rose Bearings was not identified and issued an antidumping questionnaireuntil one week before the preliminary determinations. In the course ofthese investigations it was determined that the subject merchandise constitutesmore than one class or kind of merchandise. As a result of this determination,the Department requested petitioner to resubmit LTFV allegations with respectto each class or kind of merchandise imported from each country. The petitionermade a sufficient LTFV allegation with respect to spherical plain bearingsfrom the U.K. However, none of the U.K. respondents included at that pointin the investigation produced and exported spherical plain bearings. Therefore,we sought information from petitioner and U.S. government sources to identifya producer and exporter of spherical plain bearings from the U.K. Afterreceiving such information, we identified Rose Bearings as a respondentwith respect to spherical plain bearings from the U.K. and requested aquestionnaire response. Because the Department did not bring this respondentinto the investigation until a late date, and because of the Department'sdesire to treat all respondents equitably, Rose Bearings was given a reasonableamount of time to respond to the questionnaire. Koyo's situation is notanalogous. Koyo did not identify its reporting error until five and a halfmonths after it had become a respondent and began preparing its response.Thus, the Department's treatment of Rose Bearings is clearly distinguishablefrom, and consistent with, its treatment of Koyo. (See, Comment 16 in thissection with respect to Rose Bearings.) The Department's treatment of NSK is also consistent with its treatmentof Koyo. As Koyo has asserted, the Department did identify at verificationthat NSK had made an error in its reporting of identical merchandise, wheresales with customer-specific prefix codes and bearing etching differenceswere not properly matched. The Department was able to quantify this errorand has applied best information available for those misreported identicalsales. This application of best information available is consistent withthe Department's application of best information available to Koyo; theonly difference arises from the magnitude of the misreporting. NSK's errorhad a relatively minor impact on the entirety of its response, while Koyo'sresulted in a substantially new response. Best information available hasbeen applied to both companies based on the degree of error which existedin their responses. <T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner contends that (1) at verification, the Departmentwas unable to confirm that all of SKF-FRG's home market sales consistedof bearings produced in the FRG, and (2) SKF-FRG's submissions relatingto the Department's verification reports should properly be consideredas comments on, rather than corrections to, the report. Petitioner contendsthat the Department should reject all information submitted immediatelyprior to verification, such as revised calculations for home market freight,packing, technical services, and revised calculations for U.S. adjustmentsfor ocean freight and foreign inland freight. Therefore, the Departmentmust reject SKF-FRG's response and rely upon the best information available.SKF-FRG states that the Department should reject petitioner's advice toartificially inflate SKF-FRG's dumping margins. SKF-FRG contends that thedata submitted are reliable, accurate, and verified, and should be thebasis of the Department's final determinations. Furthermore, SKF-FRG argues,as the size and complexity of these investigations caused the Departmentproblems in defining the case and the requests for information, it alsoresulted in certain errors by SKF-FRG in its initial submissions of information.SKF-FRG contends that each of the corrections was verified or verifiableby reference to verified data in the exhibits to the Department's report.Therefore, SKF-FRG states that arbitrary adjustments following petitioner'sadvice would be unjust. SKF-FRG further states that the Department hasa legal obligation to attempt to estimate the LTFV margins as accuratelyas possible and there is no reason for the Department to utilize informationother than SKF-FRG's to make its final determinations. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, wehave applied best information available for all classes or kinds of merchandisesold by SKF-FRG and for the classes or kinds of merchandise sold by SKF-Italyand SKF-Sweden where foreign market value was based on sales to the FRG.We have rejected these responses because we were not able to verify theircompleteness or accuracy. For example, we were provided with revised amounts for the quantity andvalue of sales at verification and SKF company officials were not ableto explain why these revisions were necessary or how the revised numbersrelated to the information provided in the original responses. Companyofficials were unable to explain inconsistencies and discrepancies foundduring verification which undermined the credibility of their home market,third country, and U.S. sales databases. Similar revisions were providedfor virtually every adjustment to those sales and, again, SKF company officialscould not explain the errors in calculating the original responses whichnecessitated the revisions. Essentially, we were provided with entirelynew responses at verification. Moreover, since verification, these SKFcompanies have continued to submit new information which differs substantiallyfrom the information provided at verification. Faced with responses containing numerous fundamental flaws, the Departmentcould not properly base its determinations on the information submittedby SKF-FRG or the third country sales of SKF-Italy and SKF-Sweden. Noris it acceptable, in such situations, that the Department bear the responsibilityof attempting to identify and perform numerous and substantial recalculationsnecessary for the development of accurate sales data. Such a role wouldplace too great a burden on the resources of the Department under the timeconstraints and procedural framework of these investigations.As stated in <T3>Photo Albums and Filler Pages from Korea; Final Determination of Salesat Less Than Fair Value </T3>(50 FR 43754, October 29, 1985): ``[I]t isthe obligation of respondents to provide an accurate and complete responseprior to verification so that the Department may have the opportunity tofully analyze the information and other parties are able to review andcomment on it.'' A respondent cannot shift this burden to the Departmentby submitting incomplete and inaccurate information and expect the Departmentto correct its response during the course of verification. Verificationis intended to establish the accuracy of a response rather than to reconstructthe information to fit the requirements of the Department or to performthe recalculations necessary to develop accurate information. <T3>Chinsung Indus. Co., Ltd. v. </T3><T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 89-15 at 7-8 (February 7, 1989) For all the reasons described above, we have determined that rejectionof SKF-FRG's responses and the third country responses of SKF-Italy andSKF-Sweden and use of best information available is appropriate for thesedeterminations. For the reasons discussed above, we have determined thatthe estimated margins found for SKF-FRG in the preliminary determinationsfor ball bearings, cylindrical roller bearings and spherical plain bearingsare the best information available for SKF-FRG. We have determined thatthe calculated margin for needle roller bearings from FAG-FRG is the bestinformation available for needle roller bearings from SKF-FRG. As bestinformation available for ball bearings from SKF-Italy, we have used theestimated margin found for this product in the preliminary determinationfor SKF-Italy. We have used, as best information available, the marginsin the petition for ball bearings and spherical roller bearings from SKF-Sweden.Furthermore, because we have used best information available with respectto these companies, petitioner's and respondent's comments pertaining tospecific charges and adjustments, and other issues are moot. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Petitioner contends that SKF-Italy's final rate shouldbe based on best information available, which is the higher of the ratecalculated in the petition or the highest rate for any respondent whichsubmitted an adequate response. SKF-Italy's delayed submission of informationhas limited the Department's and petitioner's opportunity for review andanalysis of such information. Petitioner further contends that SKF-Italyhas selected the information it has reported and that any useful informationis unexplained, otherwise deficient, and untimely. Because the final determinationmust fairly reflect the amount of dumping, it should not be based on incomplete,unexplained, and distorted reporting. SKF-Italy claims that it expended enormous efforts to comply with everyrequest made by the Department and that petitioner's charges are unfounded.SKF has met the Department's deadlines and has furnished all data in fullcooperation with the Department. Therefore, petitioner's allegations shouldbe disregarded.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>As discussed in Comment 6 above, we have determinedto use the best information available for ball bearings sold by SKF-Italybecause we were not able to verify its third country response. We have,however, used SKF-Italy's constructed value and U.S. sales responses forcylindrical and needle roller bearings. These responses were received bythe Department in sufficient time, were verified, and petitioner and theDepartment have had ample opportunity to review and analyze them. Furthermore,at verification we found these responses to be substantially complete andaccurate. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner contends that the final determination forSKF-Sweden should be based on best information available. In support ofits contention, petitioner claims that SKF-Sweden's public and APO versionsof the response are inadequate, that SKF-Sweden has not reported completehome market or U.S. sales, and that SKF-Sweden's reported sales containproducts it did not produce. Petitioner further claims that the best information otherwise availablefor U.S. and home market sales of part numbers or products produced inanother country is the highest margin found for any other SKF-Sweden partnumber or product, or the highest margin in the petition. Furthermore,as SKF-Sweden has acknowledged the incompleteness of its sales listingsand its inability to respond fully to the questionnaire, petitioner urgesthe Department to indicate that it is using SKF-Sweden's response onlyas best information available and not because the database is complete.SKF-Sweden claims that during the verification of the six SKF facilitiesin Europe and SKF-USA, the Department found no major discrepancies in itsdatabase. With respect to ``support production,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>sales produced by SKF facilities in another country, itaccounted for a miniscule percentage of the total part numbers reported.Moreover, the SKF companies do not price their products any differentlydepending on country of manufacture. Finally, much of petitioner's concernwith the completeness and accuracy of the response arises from its misreadingof the verification report and a typographical error in that report. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>SKF-Sweden exports three types of AFBs to the UnitedStates_ball bearings, spherical roller bearings, and cylindrical rollerbearings. We have used best information available for ball bearings andspherical roller bearings because we were not able to verify SKF-Sweden'sthird country response with respect to this merchandise, as discussed abovein Comment 6. We have, however, accepted SKF-Sweden's response with respect to cylindricalroller bearings because we found it to be substantially complete and accurate.Our views with respect to the adequacy of the public and protective orderresponses are discussed under the Administrative Protective Order and PublicSummarization section of this Appendix. Regarding the other claims made by petitioner, we examined closely SKF'smethod for assigning U.S. sales to SKF-AFB manufacturing facilities inEurope at verification. As noted above, the Department's preference fordetermining country of origin is on a sale-by-sale basis. However, giventhe manner in which SKF-USA maintains its records and the enormous effortthat would have been required to establish definitively the SKF manufacturingfacility which produced the specific merchandise, we have determined thatSKF's assignment methodology is reasonable and accepted it for these investigations.Finally, we verified that there is no ``support production'' for cylindricalroller bearings sold by SKF-Sweden in the home market. Therefore, all homemarket sales were of merchandise produced by SKF-Sweden. <T3>Comment 9. </T3>Petitioner claims that the record in these proceedingsdoes not support the use of third-country sales to determine foreign marketvalue for SKF-Sweden's ball bearings and spherical roller bearings. Aswith SKF-Sweden's home market sales, the record lacks evidence that thereported third country sales are actually produced in Sweden. Moreover,based on information gathered at verification, the FRG was not the largestthird country market in terms of the volume of sales. Finally, petitioneralleges that third-country sales of the products under investigation wereomitted from the response. SKF-Sweden contends that the Department was able to verify the completenessand accuracy of its third-country response. The difference between thequantities reported in the response and the quantities provided at verificationwas minimal. Moreover, the statement in the Department's verification reportthat company officials were unable to show that product source codes weredefinitive should be disregarded as unsupported. Also, the Department wasable to trace the reported sales to the company's business records. Finally,SKF-Sweden was correct in reporting sales to the FRG because it is a substantialmarket and contained identical merchandise to that sold in the United States.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>For the reasons discussed in the Market Viabilitysection of this appendix, we determined that SKF-Sweden's sales to theFRG served as the most appropriate basis for determining the FMV of SKF-Sweden'sball bearings and spherical roller bearings. However, we were not ableto verify SKF-Sweden's third country response and have applied the bestinformation available for these classes or kinds of merchandise as discussedin Comment 6 above. <T3>Comment 10. </T3>Petitioner asserts that the Department was unableto verify INA-FRG's quantity and value figures for the products under investigationbecause INA-FRG does not distinguish between export and domestic salesin its financial statements. Also, for U.S. sales, INA-FRG based all ofits allocations for U.S. price adjustment purposes upon a sales figurethat included products outside the scope of these investigations. For thesereasons, petitioner argues that the Department should reject INA's responseand use the best information available. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have used INA-FRG's responses for the purposesof our final determinations with respect to ball bearings and needle rollerbearings. Despite the fact that INA-FRG does not distinguish between domesticand export sales in its financial statements, we were able to verify thequantity and value of sales of the products under investigation becauseINA-FRG was able to retrieve this information from its computerized salesdatabase. At verification, we reviewed its product classification and thecomputer program, and found only minor discrepancies. Therefore, we concludethat the quantity and value of sales of the products under investigationwere verified. Although our preference is for product-specific expenses, we have acceptedINA-FRG's allocations for U.S. sales. Given that INA-FRG does not maintainthese types of expenses on a product-specific basis, the number of productssold by the company and the difficulty of assigning specific expenses tospecific products, we find it reasonable to accept allocations which includeproducts not covered by these investigations as best information available.With respect to cylindrical roller bearings from INA-FRG, where a respondenthas cooperated with our requests for information but was unable to providethe information requested in a timely manner or in the form required, wehave used as best information available as discussed above. Therefore,we have used the margin calculated for cylindrical roller bearings fromFAG-FRG in the final determination as best information available for cylindricalroller bearings from INA-FRG. (<T3>See, </T3>Cost of Production (company-specific) section of this Appendix.)<T3>Comment 11. </T3>Petitioner contends that SKF-U.K.'s response shouldbe rejected in its entirety in favor of best information available. Insupport of its contention, petitioner claims that: (1) The Department didnot adequately verify the accuracy or completeness of SKF-U.K.'s home marketsales; (2) country coding problems may mean that reported sales were incompleteor that products were included which are not produced in the U.K.; and(3) the public and protective order versions of SKF-U.K.'s responses wereinadequate. Best information available should be based on the higher ofthe information in the petition or the rate for a responding firm. SKF-U.K. states that its database is accurate and reliable. It maintainsthat no major discrepancies were detected at verification and that itsdatabases should be used for purposes of the final determinations. Furthermore,SKF-U.K. contends that the country of origin of the products and the countryof manufacture reported to the Department were fully verified and the factthat SKF does not maintain country of origin records is totally irrelevant.SKF-U.K. argues that support production impacts a small proportion of thepart numbers reported by SKF, that all sales subject to support productionwere reported, and that SKF does not price its products differently dependingon country of manufacture. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Our views with respect to the adequacy of publicand protective order responses are addressed in the Administrative ProtectiveOrder and Public Summarization section of this Appendix. We disagree with petitioner's contention that the Department did not adequatelyverify SKF-U.K.'s home market sales response. The purpose of verificationis to spot-check the respondent's questionnaire response and is not intendedto be an exhaustive examination of the response. <T3>See, Monsanto Company </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>698 F. Supp. 285 (CIT 1988). In this case, we weresatisfied that SKF-U.K.'s transactions were accurately reported based onthose we verified.At verification, we also examined closely SKF's method for assigning U.S.sales to the SKF-AFB manufacturing facilities in Europe. The Department'spreference for determining country of origin is on a sale-by-sale basis.However, given the manner in which SKF-USA maintains its records and theenormous effort that would have been required to establish definitivelythe SKF manufacturing facility which produced specific merchandise, wehave determined that SKF's assignment methodology is reasonable and haveaccepted it for these investigations. Finally, we also reviewed carefully the problem of ``support production.''Because the merchandise produced in another SKF facility would be soldat the same price that would be charged for merchandise produced by theSKF facility in the country in question and because the amounts of suchsales were relatively small, we have concluded for purposes of these investigationsthat their inclusion in the database does not distort the calculation offoreign market value. Therefore, we have determined it appropriate to acceptSKF-U.K.'s response. For these reasons, we have not applied best information available to SKF-U.K.<T3>Comment 12.</T3> Instead of using SNR's claimed home market deductionsfor the final determinations, petitioner contends that the Department shoulduse information supplied by petitioner or other respondents as best informationavailable for the following reasons: (1) SNR used 1987 expenses to calculateallocation percentages (petitioner argues that only the Department hasthe right to define the POI), (2) SNR's use of 1987 expenses are not representativeof the POI, (3) these 1987 home market expenses were not verifiable, and(4) SNR's home market allocation percentages are based on products outsidethe scope of the investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We are accepting SNR's data for purposes of calculatingadjustments to foreign market value. Although we prefer that respondentreport expenses covering the full period of investigation, we have acceptedSNR's l987 data as best information available. Also, while our preferenceis for product-specific expenses, given the number of products sold bySNR and the difficulty of assigning specific expenses to specific products,we believe it reasonable to accept allocations which include products notsubject to these investigations. Finally, although the consolidated expenseswere not reported in the company's 1987 financial expenses, we were ableto verify independently the amounts that went into these consolidated figures.<T3>Comment 13.</T3> Petitioner contends that the final determination forICSA/SNRI should be based on best information available. Specifically,petitioner contends that: (1) ICSA's margins should be based on sales byeach member of the ICSA group to the first unrelated customer in both markets,but as the Department failed to collect this information, a combined ratebased on FAG-Italy and SKF-Italy spherical roller bearings should be used;(2) the date of invoice could not be verified as the date of sale in anumber or instances; and (3) charges and adjustments to home market pricesare based on 1987 expenses and sales, rather than data for the period ofinvestigation. With respect to the latter deficiency, if the Departmentuses ICSA/SNRI's response, all charges and adjustments should be treatedas indirect selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have determined that it is appropriate to useICSA/SNRI's response for the final determination. With respect to petitioner'sfirst comment, the Department elected to send a questionnaire only to ICSA/SNRIbecause this company accounted for more than 60 percent of U.S. importsof spherical roller bearings from Italy. We are also satisfied that dateof invoice is an acceptable proxy for date of sale for this company. Inmost cases, the invoice was issued on the date of sale. On balance, thereis no reason to believe use of invoice date as the date of sale has distortedthe home market database.Finally, we have determined it appropriate to accept ICSA/SNRI's use of1987 data for purposes of calculating adjustments to foreign market value.While we prefer that respondents report expenses covering the full periodof investigation, we have accepted SNR's 1987 data as best informationavailable. <T3>Comment 14.</T3> Petitioner argues that the revised computer tape containinghome market and U.S. sales which RHP submitted to the Department afterverification was not verified. Petitioner argues that the extensive numberof changes after verification made by RHP constitutes a major reconstructionof its response and requires the Department to reject the resubmissionin favor of best information available. Furthermore, petitioner statesthat if the revised data is used, the agency should run a computer analysisof the new submission to confirm that all of the changes requested wereproperly made. Petitioner suggests that if any discrepancy is found, thesubmission must be rejected in favor of best information available. RHP contends that the Department verified RHP's U.K. and U.S. sales listingsand that the slight revisions made in the computer tapes were based onverified information and at the request of the Department. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The revisions made to RHP's U.S. and home marketsales computer tape incorporated data the Department reviewed at verification.We view these changes as minor and as such, they do not warrant rejectionof the resubmitted tapes. Moreover, it is the Department's practice toreview revised tapes to ensure that no data from previously submitted tapeshas been altered and that the revisions are in accordance with the Department'sfindings at verification. As no discrepancies were found in our reviewof RHP's tapes, we are using them for purposes of the final determination.<T3>Comment 15.</T3> Petitioner maintains that for purposes of the finaldetermination, the Department should reject, on the basis of incompletenessand untimeliness, NMB/Pelmec Singapore's data and use the highest marginalleged in the petition as best information available pursuant to 19 U.S.C.section l677e(b). Although the Department determined that the home marketwas not viable, respondent failed to submit third country sales data ina timely manner. Therefore, petitioner contends that it is inappropriatefor the Department to rely on the third country data submitted. Furthermore,petitioner claims that NMB/Pelmec Singapore failed to report all U.S. salesof Pelmec products and third country sales to a related party which weremade at higher prices than sales of the same products to unrelated parties.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree with petitioner's general assertionthat NMB/Pelmec Singapore's response should be rejected. On September 23,1988, we determined that NMB/Pelmec Singapore's home market was not viableand requested that third country data be submitted. On October 7, 1988,NMB/Pelmec Singapore submitted third country data. Although we did notreceive this information in sufficient time to analyze fully and use forpurposes of the preliminary determination, we were able to fully analyzeit prior to verification and, thus, to verify it. Therefore, we have usedthis information for purposes of the final determination. With respect to NMB/Pelmec Singapore's unreported U.S. sales of Pelmecproducts, we found at verification that the unreported sales constituteonly one tenth of one percent by volume of the 33 percent of sales reportedpursuant to our simplification procedures and that the unit prices on theseunreported sales were nearly three times greater than the unit prices forthe same products to other customers which were reported in the sales listing.Therefore, we found that NMB/Pelmec Singapore's failure to report thesesalea would have a negligible effect, if any, on our price comparisons.With respect to petitioner's assertion that the third country related partysales should have been reported, the sales in question were to a relatedOEM that used the bearings in the production of products which fall outsidethe scope of investigation. In accordance with section 353.22(b) of ourregulations, it is our normal practice to disregard related party sales.Rather, we require that respondents report the first sale to an unrelatedparty, unless the respondent makes arguments and provides sufficient informationto enable us to analyze the comparability of related and unrelated sales.In the case of NMB/Pelmec Singapore, it was unable to report the firstsale to an unrelated party because the first sale to an unrelated partywas of a product not within the scope of investigation. To perform an analysis of the comparability of related and unrelated sales,we generally require that a respondent provide sales-specific or customer-specificpayment terms for credit expenses, as well as sales-specific informationon commissions, rebates, and discounts. Without such information, we areunable to determine that sales to related parties are comparable to salesto unrelated parties. In this case, NMB/Pelmec Singapore made no argumentthat its sales to related parties should be used on the basis that theyare comparable to sales to unrelated parties. During verification, we notedthat the sales prices to a related OEM were higher than the prices forthe same product to unrelated parties. However, we did not examine otherfactors such as credit terms, commissions, rebates, and discounts. Therefore,we were not able to determine whether such sales were, in fact, made atarm's length, and we did not request that respondent report complete informationon these related party sales. <T3>Comment 16.</T3> Petitioner contends that the questionnaire responsesubmitted by Rose Bearings was untimely and that verification of its responsewas too late to permit all parties a fair opportunity to comment. Therefore,the Department should use best information available in accordance with19 U.S.C. 1677e(b). <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Subsequent to our determination that the subjectmerchandise constitutes more than one class or kind of merchandise, wefound that we had no respondent for spherical plain bearings from the U.K.Petitioner was unable to identify a producer of spherical plain bearingsin the U.K., and we did not identify Rose Bearings as a producer of sphericalplain bearings until mid-October. At that time we issued a questionnaireto Rose Bearings, dated one week prior to the preliminary determinations.Rose Bearings used the same amount of time as other respondents in theseinvestigations to complete its response to the questionnaire. Thus, wedetermined that it was appropriate to verify Rose Bearings, response. Furthermore,both petitioner and Rose Bearings were afforded the opportunity to commenton the verification report. <T3>Comment 17.</T3> Yamaha Parts Distributors, Inc., and Subaru of AmericaInc., importers of AFBs from Japan, argue that it is unfair to includemargins derived from using best information available (BIA) in calculatingthe ``all other'' country-wide rate for ball bearings and spherical plainbearings. They request that the Department compute the all other rate ina manner that more accurately estimates actual country-wide dumping margins.They also state that the Department has refused to include best informationavailable rates in country-wide calculations in countervailing duty investigations,citing the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; Certain GraniteProducts From Spain </T3>(53 FR 24340, June 28, 1988) and <T3>Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; IndustrialBelts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, fromthe Republic of Korea </T3>(53 FR 48672, December 2, l988). <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We believe that including the margins for all respondents,even those which were derived from using best information available, doesaccurately reflect the estimated country-wide dumping margin. One reasona company may choose not to respond to our questionnaire is that it believesthat any rate assigned to it using best information available would notbe significantly different from the rate that would be derived on the basisof its own information. If the two rates are judged by the potential respondentnot to be significantly different, that company is likely to conclude thatparticipation in the investigation is not worth the trouble and expense.Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the inclusion of marginsbased on best information available will necessarily distort the country-widemargin. Furthermore, companies not selected as respondents such as Yamahaand Subaru, but desiring their own margin based on their actual sales information,may voluntarily submit a response to our questionnaire. Yamaha and Subaruchose not to do so. Yamaha and Subaru have misinterpreted our current practice in calculatingcountry-wide rates in countervailing duty investigations. The Department'spolicy in fact has been to include calculations based on best informationavailable in the country-wide rate. In <T3>Industrial Belts from Korea, </T3>we calculated a separate rate forone company, based on best information available because its estimatednet subsidy differed significantly from the country-wide rate. In <T3>Certain Granite Products from Spain, </T3>we used best informationavailable in calculating the estimated net subsidy for two companies thatdid not respond to our questionnaire. In our final determination in thatcase, we indicated that we were unable to include those two companies inthe calculation of the country-wide rate because we did not have informationon the value of their exports of the subject merchandise to the UnitedStates. It was for that reason, not because we used best information available,that they were not included in the calculation of the country-wide rate.<T3>Comment 18.</T3> Petitioner contends that Minebea Japan's databaseis inadequate because it failed to report sales of rod ends, sphericalplain bearings, and bushings. Therefore, the Department should use as bestinformation available the rate calculated for Minebea in the preliminarydetermination of 226.68 percent. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with petitioner that Minebea Japan's databaseis deficient to the extent that it failed to report rod ends and certainspherical plain bearings. Therefore, for Minebea's unreported rod endsand unreported spherical plain bearings, we have used the rate calculatedfor NTN's spherical plain bearings as best information available. We thencalculated a weighted average of this result, by quantity, with the ratecalculated for those products which were reported and verified. The totalquantity figure used for the unreported sales in this calculation was verified.On this basis, we calculated an estimated dumping margin as best informationavailable for Minebea Japan's exports of spherical plain bearings. <T3>Comment 19.</T3> Petitioner states that certain sales claimed by NSKas ``samples'', including inch-size bearings and prototypes used for customertrials, should not be excluded from the home market sales listing. Petitionerstates that the classification of sales as ``not in the ordinary courseof trade'' should follow the standards articulated in the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings, Finished and Unfinished, and Parts Thereof from Japan, </T3>52FR 30704 (August 17, 1987), which required that the bearings in questionbe sold in extremely small quantities and at prices substantially higherthan the vast majority of sales in the ordinary course of trade. Petitionerfurthermore contends that high home market prices or low sales volume cannotin and of itself establish that sales were outside the ordinary courseof trade. Based on the statutory definition of ``ordinary course of trade''(19 U.S.C. 1677(15)) and that of ``usual commercial quantities'' as definedin the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, section 612(a)(4), the fact that salesare made in small quantities does not disqualify such sales from the calculationof foreign market value. Additionally, NSK failed to support its claimthat five specific part numbers were not sold in the ordinary course oftrade in the home market. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with petitioner with respect to the fivespecific bearing models cited and sold in large quantities in the UnitedStates. NSK was unable to show that these bearings were not sold in theordinary course of trade in the home market. The quantities sold of thesebearings in the home market are comparable to the quantities of similarbearings sold in the home market. Therefore, we have applied a best informationavailable rate for the quantity of these five bearings excluded by NSKfor comparison. We verified that certain other excluded bearings were outsidethe ordinary course of trade.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 9: Date of Sale </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department should includeINA-FRG U.S. sales made pursuant to a long-term contract in the fair valuecomparisons. Petitioner alleges that even though the parties entered intothe contract prior to the period of investigation, the primary terms ofthe contract varied up to the date of shipment which fell within the periodof investigation. Respondent, INA-FRG, claims that the Department shouldexclude the sales made pursuant to the contract which was executed priorto the period of investigation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department determined during verification thatthe material terms of the contract (<T3>e.g., </T3>price and quantity), were subject to modification up tothe date of shipment. Because the material terms of the contract were notfixed until the date of shipment, the shipment date is the appropriatedate of sale. Therefore, the Department has included these sales in thefair value comparisons. The Department also notes that INA-FRG's requestthat the Department use date of contract rather than date of shipment asthe correct date of sale, departs from all INA-FRG's previous submissionswhich designate date of shipment as the appropriate date of sale. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>SKF claims that for all SKF companies, the primaryterms of sale continue to change until the invoice is issued. Therefore,the appropriate date of sale is the invoice date which directly correspondsto the date of shipment. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department agrees with respondent. The dateof sale is the date of the earliest written evidence firmly establishingthe material terms of sale. <T3>Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from the Federal Republic of Germany,</T3>52 FR 28170, 28172 (July 28, 1987). Verification conclusively revealedthat the date the invoice is issued is the point at which the materialterms of the first sale become fixed. Therefore, the invoice date constitutesthe date of the earliest written evidence which firmly establishes thematerial terms of sale. Thus, the invoice date is the appropriate dateof sale. The Department notes that the invoice date is identical to theshipment date. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>Petitioner claims that FAG-FRG incorrectly reportedthe date of sale for those sales made pursuant to a long-term contract.Petitioner argues that the material terms of the sales vary between thedate of contract and the date of shipment of the merchandise. Therefore,the date of shipment rather than the date of contract represents the correctdate of sale. Petitioner maintains that the effect of allowing FAG-FRG to report dateof contract as date of sale, is that FAG-FRG can take advantage of morefavorable exchange rates in effect on the date of contract as comparedto the date of shipment. Petitioner further argues that sales pursuantto long-term contracts entered into before the period of investigationwere excluded even though the bearings were shipped within the period orprice and quantity terms changed during the period of investigation. Petitionerargues that exclusion of the subject sales may affect the 33 percent threshholdrequirement and viablility tests. Therefore, the Department should rejectFAG's home market sales database and apply the best information availablefor the purpose of the final determinations. With regard to order entry sales, petitioner argues that FAG-FRG excludedsales with order entry dates which occurred before the period of investigationbut whose invoice dates fell within the period of investigation. Conversely,FAG-FRG included sales with order entry dates which fell within the periodbut which were modified after the period. FAG-FRG claims that the reported date of sale for sales made pursuant toa long-term contract are correct because the company reported sales asof either (1) the date of contract, which fell within the period of investigation,or (2) the date of renegotiation, if changes to material terms occurredafter the parties entered into the contract. Therefore, because the datessubmitted by respondent are the correct dates of sale, the sales databaseis complete and viability is unaffected. For order entry sales, the reported date of sale is the time of order entry.FAG-FRG admits that some changes in the terms of sale occurred after dateof order entry; however, such changes were rare. Therefore, the Departmentshould accept the date of order entry as the date of sale because priceand quantity terms were fixed at that time. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department agrees with respondent. The dateof sale is the date on which the material terms of the contract are finalized.<T3>Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies From Japan, </T3>50 FR45447, 45451 (October 31, 1985). Verification conclusively establishedthat for long-term contract sales, (1) FAG reported date of sale as ofthe time the material terms were fixed in the contract; (2) in the eventof contract renegotiations, FAG reported date of sale as of the date ofrenegotiation; and (3) the sales database was accurate and complete. Therefore,the Department has used either the date of initial contract or in the eventof a renegotiation, the date of renegotiation as the date of sale for thosesales made pursuant to a long-term contract. With respect to petitioner's argument on exchange rates, the home marketdates of sale are accurately reported and the foreign market value hasbeen converted to dollars using the exchange rate in effect on the dateof the U.S. sale in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56. Therefore, we do notunderstand how respondent has availed itself of favorable rates. The Department is satisfied that the date of order entry for sales otherthan sales made under a long-term contract is the appropriate date of sale.While terms did change subsequent to the entry order date, the instancesin which this occurred were rare. Therefore, the Department has determinedthat the use of order entry date as the date of sale is reasonable. <T3>Comment 4. </T3>Petitioner contends that FAG-Italy incorrectly reportedthe date of sale for those sales made pursuant to a long term contract.Petitioner argues that the material terms of the sales vary between thedate of contract and the date of shipment of the merchandise. Therefore,the date of shipment rather than the date of contract represents the correctdate of sale. Petitioner further argues that as a result of the erroneousdate of sale method used by FAG-Italy, the long-term contract sales withinthe period of investigation were excluded. Therefore, the Department shouldapply the best information available for the purpose of the final determinations.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department disagrees with petitioner. (<T3>See, </T3><T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 3 </T3>above.)<T3>Comment 5.</T3> Nachi contends that the Department should allow anadjustment in price for exchange rate fluctuations occurring after thedate of contract. Pursuant to a contractual agreement with Nachi's tradingcompanies on purchase price sales, the risk of exchange rate fluctuationsis evenly apportioned between Nachi and certain trading companies wherethe exchange rate fluctuates beyond a predetermined range between the dateof contract and the date of payment. For example, if the yen depreciatesagainst the dollar above the agreed upon range, then Nachi pays half ofthe difference in cost to the trading company. If the yen appreciates belowthe range, then the trading company pays half the difference in cost toNachi. Therefore, Nachi asserts that the ``yen clause'' constitutes merelyan ``adjustment to price made after the contract but according to termsfixed at the time of contract.'' Petitioner argues that the Department should deny the claimed ``yen clause''adjustment because the price to the ultimate purchaser is unaffected. Petitioneralso claims that if the Department accepts the ``yen clause'' adjustmentfor purposes of the final determinations, the Department will have usedincorrect dates of sale in that the price was not fixed at the time ofcontract in so far as the adjustment to price occurred after the date ofcontract. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with respondent. The yen clauseadjustment serves to apportion the burden of exchange rate risk betweenNachi and its trading companies. The price is set at the date of contract,as is the predetermined range in which exchange rate fluctuations resultin no adjustment to price. Although adjustments to price were made afterthe date of contract, such adjustments were made pursuant to a provisionwithin that contract. In <T3>Voss Intern. Corp.</T3> v<T3> United States, </T3>628 F.2d 1328 (CCPA, 1980), the Court of Customsandamp; Patent Appeals held that the price was ``determined,'' despite thefact that the U.S. purchaser did not know the exact amount in U.S. dollarsit would have to pay for the merchandise, because the parties had nothingmore to negotiate or agree to regarding price. The parties in<T3> Voss</T3> had agreed to renegotiate the price to factor in the dollar/yenexchange rate fluctuations. The Court in <T3>Voss</T3> found that the parties had agreed to a ``definite and determinableprice'' notwithstanding the fact that one party would pay ``more or lessdollars in accordance with exchange rate fluctuations * * *'' Id. at 1335.As in <T3>Voss, </T3>the parties here had nothing more to agree to, and a definiteand determinable price existed as of the date of contract. Therefore, forthe purpose or the final determinations, the Department has found thatthe appropriate date of sales is the date Nachi entered into this contractwith its trading partner. The Department accepts the yen clause adjustment as a circumstance of saleadjustment because the ``yen clause'' provision is part of a contractualarrangement with Nachi's customer and changes the actual amount paid toNachi by the trading company. Therefore, the ultimate price paid on theseU.S. sales has been changed. <T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner argues that the date of order acknowledgment,which Rose listed as the date of sale for home market sales, could notbe fully verified. In addition, for U.S. sales, the date of shipment isused as the date of sale. Because of these discrepancies and the time lagbetween different steps in the sales process, petitioner argues that theDepartment should use the date of shipment as the date of sale. Rose contendsthat its method of establishing the date of sale is consistent with theDepartment's practice. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> In its questionnaire response, Rose listed the dateof order acknowledgment as the date of sale for both home market and U.S.sales. At verification, we confirmed that the order acknowledgment datewas the date when price and quantity terms were first set, and we haveused that date as the date of sale. Although some order acknowledgment dates were incorrectly reported in Rose'squestionnaire response, these were for sales to companies that had changedtheir names between the time an order was taken and the time the orderwas actually shipped. Rose had re-entered new order acknowledgments whenthe companies changed their names. Since price and quantity terms werenot affected by the name changes, we considered the date of the originalorder acknowledgment to be the date of sale. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Rose contends that, although a discrepancy was foundat verification regarding the date of sale for certain home market transactions,even if these sales were not considered for comparison purposes, therewould still be over 33 percent, by volume, of U.S. products matched tohome market sales of identical products. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with Rose. We have not consideredcertain home market transactions with dates of sale outside the periodof investigation, but we have still found identical home market matchesfor over 33 percent of U.S. sales by volume. <T3>Comment 8.</T3> Petitioner contends that, for NMB/Pelmec Thai's salesto Singapore which were included as home market sales, the date of theforecast under the blanket purchase order is the correct basis for thedate of sale because liability under the purchase order is the quantityon the forecasts; thus the date of the forecast is the date the terms areagreed. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Thai has reported the date of the forecastas the date of sale, as petitioner suggests. However, because we have consideredthe sales in question to be export sales, this issue is moot (<T3>See, </T3>Market Viability section of this Appendix). <T3>Comment 9.</T3> Petitioner contends that a significant discrepancywas found during verification of NMB/Pelmec Thai regarding the date ofsale and the reporting of U.S. sales. According to petitioner, NMB/PelmecThai executed a contract on April 6, 1988, covering sales that had beenshipped since December 2, 1987. To the extent such shipments were not reported,petitioner argues that NMB/Pelmec Thai's U.S. sales listing is incompleteand should be rejected.Petitioner also maintains that there was an unshipped balance under thecontract as of March 31, 1988, and that NMB/Pelmec Thai included thesesales as sales within the period of investigation, although the date ofsale was reported as March 31, 1988 rather than the April 6, 1988 dateof contract. Petitioner contends that it is improper to include NMB/PelmecThai's post-March 31, 1988 shipments in its U.S. sales listing absent evidencethat an agreement had been reached prior to April 6, or absent other informationestablishing the date of sale. Petitioner further contends that the reductionin ``identical'' U.S. sales may affect the 33 percent reporting requirementsand, therefore, the Department should re-examine whether NMB/Pelmec Thaireported a sufficient volume of U.S. sales. NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that it demonstrated at verification that thecontract was operable before the date of signature because shipments werebeing made under that contract during the period of investigation. Respondentfurther argues that it reported a large percentage of the sales under thiscontract which were shipped or scheduled for shipment. Because the contractcalled for additonal expected shipments and because the contract was operable,NMB/Pelmec Thai correctly treated the remainder as unshipped sales fallingwithin the period of investigation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>During verification we established that the April6, 1988 contract was operable for shipments beginning on December 2, 1987covering a stipulated minimum quantity of ball bearings. NMB/Pelmec Thaireported all shipments made pursuant to this contract using the date ofshipment as the date of sale. We also verified that, for those sales notshipped as of March 31, 1988 but made pursuant to the April 6 contract,NMB/Pelmec Thai considered these sales to be within the period of investigationand reported the date of sale as March 31, 1988. We have determined that NMB/Pelmec accurately reported the date of shipmentas the date of sale for all shipments made during the period of investigationpursuant to the April 6, 1988 contract. The fact that the merchandise wasdelivered and paid for indicates the existence of an agreement for sale.As such, the date of shipment constitutes the date of sale. (<T3>See, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Forged SteelCrankshafts from the Federal Republic of Germany, </T3>52 FR July 28, 1987.)With respect to the unshipped balance under the contract as March 31, 1988,we have excluded these sales from our analysis  because we consider themto be sales after the period of investigation. In addition, we have examinedthe effect of excluding the unshipped balance from the U.S. sales databaseand have determined that there was sufficient coverage to meet our minimumreporting requirements. <T3>Comment 10. </T3>Petitioner contends that the date of sale for NMB/PelmecThai's home market sales was incorrectly reported based on the manufacturingorder date rather than the purchase order date. Petitioner further contendsthat the reporting of sales based on the date of the purchase order mightreveal a significant number of additional home market sales of bearingsidentical to those exported to the United States during the period of investigation.NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that the manufacturing order date is the appropriatebasis for date of sale for home market sales because the price and quantitiesare set at that date. Any undelivered quantities are placed in the backlogfor that customer, and the customer is obligated to purchase the wholeamount if it ceases its regular orders. NMB/Pelmec Thai argues that, even if the Department considers the dateof sale to be the purchase order date, the model matches do not change.The same models were sold during the period of investigation, regardlessof the manner in which the date of sale is established. Respondent furthermaintains that the impact of the slightly different product mix dependingon the date of sale methodology on the weighted-average foreign marketvalue is insignificant, since these products were matched to a limitednumber of units sold in the United States. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Because we have determined that the Thai home marketwas not viable, we have not used home market sales as the basis for foreignmarket value. Therefore, this issue need not be addressed.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 10: Movement Charges </ITAG>A. Allocation Methodology <T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner contends that ADR (an SKF company in France)originally claimed that its inland freight allocation was on the basisof weight and that verification revealed that freight was allocated basedon the per unit cost of manufacture. Petitioner argues that this reallocationresults in a redistribution of freight expenses away from high volume partnumbers regardless of the weight or size of the bearing. Moreover, petitionerstates that the data should not be considered verified because verificationwas based only on a sample that was selected by ADR at that time. SKF-France contends that the original calculation of inland freight onADR's home market sales was incorrect and was explained during the costof production verification. SKF-France states that the correct and verifiedinformation is reflected in the revised U.S. and home market sales listings.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified that the revised allocation was reasonableand have adjusted SKF-ADR's U.S. and home market prices for the inlandfreight expense as reported in the revised U.S. and home market sales listings.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>Petitioner argues that, because the inland freightcalculations account for products that are not subject to investigation,the inland freight charges reported by FAG-Italy should not be treatedas a direct selling expense. FAG-Italy maintains that use of 1987 data covering shipments of productsboth investigated and not investigated is nondistortive. In light of thefact that this data was the only complete information on actual costs availablefrom normal accounting records, the Department should use the claimed expensesfor the final determination. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Although our request for information and methodologicalpreference is for the reporting of expenses covering the full period ofinvestigation, we verified that the allocation methodology employed byFAG-Italy to calculate inland freight was reasonable. Therefore, as bestinformation available, we have accepted FAG-Italy's use of 1987 data forpurposes of calculating the claimed charges in these determinations. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>Petitioner contends that FAG-FRG did not submit actualtransaction-specific data relating to home market inland freight charges.Therefore, the Department should disallow any deductions from foreign marketvalue for such charges. FAG-FRG argues that it does not maintain inland freight records on a transaction-specificbasis nor does the Department require that freight expenses be reportedas such. Therefore, the Department should use the verified inland freightexpenses for FAG-FRG and the revised costs for Elges (another FAG companyin the FRG) in the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified that FAG-FRG does not maintain inlandfreight records on a transaction-specific basis. Verification confirmedthat the allocation methodology used by respondent was reasonable. Therefore,we have used the verified costs for FAG-FRG and the revised costs for Elgesfor purposes of these determinations. <T3>Comment 4. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department should rejectGMN's information regarding inland freight expense and allow no adjustmentto foreign market value for this expense. Petitioner claims that GMN providedworksheets of freight costs on a per gram basis at verification in responseto the Department's statement in its preliminary determination that GMN'sestimated inland freight expense would have to be supplemented and verifiedin order to be used in the final determination. Petitioner argues thatit is the policy of the Department not to accept new information at verification.Petitioner submits that since the information was provided at verificationand could not be reviewed beforehand by the Department or the petitioner,and since the Department could not tie the expense allocation used by GMNto actual production or shipments, the information should be rejected.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>In our preliminary determination of October 27,1988, we stated that we had accepted GMN's inland freight expense, butthat for the final determination we would require an allocation of thisexpense by weight. GMN had originally submitted a home market inland freightexpense based upon value for a representative sample of home market bearingshipments. In the cover letter to our supplemental questionnaire datedNovember 1, 1988, we stated that any information not received by the Departmentin time to be fully analyzed prior to verification might not be consideredfor purposes of our final determination. On November 8, 1988, we receivedfrom GMN an allocation of freight expenses on the basis of value for homemarket ball bearing shipments during the period of investigation. GMN claimedthat it did not maintain records which would enable it to report the totalweight of ball bearing shipments for the period of investigation. At verification,GMN reallocated this expense based on the weight of the bearings producedduring the period under the <T3>hypothetical assumption </T3>that it was operating at full capacityduring the period of investigation. At that time, we gave no indicationwhether that information would be used for purposes of the final determination.Given that the reallocation constituted new information and a significantlyrevised methodology presented for the first time at verification, we haveused GMN's value allocation submitted prior to verification as the bestinformation available for purposes of the final determination. (<T3>See, Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan, </T3>54 FR 3099,January 23, 1989). <T3>See </T3>also <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 7 </T3>for further discussion of freight allocation based onweight versus sales value.<T3>Comment 5. </T3>Petitioner contends that ICSA's allocation methodologiesfor foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, ocean freight, marineinsurance, U.S. inland freight, and packing and containerization on U.S.sales should be rejected for the following reasons: (1) They are basedon either value or volume rather than weight, (2) some apply a percentagecharge determined from total 1987 sales to sales in the period of investigation,and (3) the methodologies are inconsistent from one charge to another.Petitioner makes similar comments with respect to ICSA's home market inlandfreight, inland insurance, and packing expenses. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We verified that the allocation methodologies usedby ICSA for the above-mentioned movement and packing expense claims arereasonable. Even though our request for information and methodologicalpreference is for the reporting of expenses covering the full period ofinvestigation and the allocation of movement and packing expenses basedon weight, we have accepted ICSA's use of 1987 data and its value-basedallocations for purposes of calculating adjustments to U.S. price as bestinformation available. <T3>See, DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 7 </T3>for further discussion of allocation issue. <T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should disallowINA-FRG's response regarding the following adjustments to foreign marketvalue: interest expense, technical services, warranties, advertising, qualitycontrol expenses and indirect selling expenses. According to petitioner,INA-FRG improperly calculated these expenses by dividing the total corporateexpense by total domestic sales, which include sales of products not subjectto investigation. Petitioner asserts that the Department was unable toverify the actual quantity and value of domestic sales. Furthermore, petitionermaintains that because the Department has divided the subject merchandiseinto five classes or kinds of merchandise, respondent should have beenrequired to report expenses by product type. Because INA did not providesuch a breakdown, its response should be rejected. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> With regard to the quantity and value of domesticsales, we found only a minor discrepancy in INA's response, and we wereable to verify the accurate amount. With regard to the selling expensesnoted by petitioner, we verified that INA does not maintain records insuch a way as to enable it to report its expenses for each separate classor kind of merchandise. Therefore, we found INA's allocation of expensesover total sales of all products, including products not under investigation,to be reasonable. Accordingly, we have accepted INA's reported expensesas best information available for purposes of these determinations. <T3>Comment 7.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should disallowINA-FRG's and INA-France's responses regarding freight and packing adjustmentsto foreign market value. According to petitioner, INA-FRG and INA-Franceimproperly calculated these expenses using an allocation based on salesvalue, rather than actual costs or an allocation based on weight. Petitionercontends also that the Department should reject this allocation becauseit includes sales of products not subject to investigation. Petitionermakes similar arguments regarding the freight allocations used by ICSA,NSK, NTN, GMN, Rose, and SNR. INA-FRG and INA-France argue that the Department should accept these adjustmentsto foreign market value. They assert that their allocation methodologybased on sales value for certain costs such as freight, insurance, packing,and duties was reasonable. As examples of cases where the Department hasaccepted alternative allocation methodologies, INA cites <T3>Color Picture Tubes from Singapore, </T3>52 FR 44190, 44195, (November18, 1987), <T3>Color Picture Tubes from Japan, </T3>52 FR 44171, 44180, (November18, 1987), <T3>Color Television Receivers from Korea, </T3>51 FR 41365 (November 14,1986), and <T3>Choline Chloride from Canada, </T3>49 FR 36532, 36534 (September 18,1984). INA emphasizes the complexity of calculating these costs on anybasis other than value and maintains that its allocation methodology closelyapproximates actual costs incurred. INA argues further that an allocationby weight is no more accurate than its allocation by value. <T3>DOC Position.</T3>  We agree with petitioner that expenses incurredfor freight and packing are usually based on the weight or physical volumeof the merchandise. Acccordingly, our methodological preference is forallocation of these expenses on the basis of the unit weight of the individualproducts shipped or packed. We therefore requested respondents to calculatefreight and packing expenses by weight. However, many of the respondentswere unable to allocate these charges on this basis. Rather, they usedan allocation methodology based on sales value, which they argued was reasonablebased on their record-keeping systems. Verification confirmed that thiswas the case for many of the respondents. Furthermore, we have acceptedthe allocation of these expenses by value in past cases as cited by respondents.Therefore, we used the respondents' value-based allocations as the bestinformation available in the cases of INA-FRG, INA-France, ICSA, GMN, NSK,NTN, Rose, and SNR for purposes of the final determinations. <T3>See </T3>also respective company-specific comments on this issue inthis section of the appendix. <T3>Comment 8.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should compareINA-France's reported movement expenses (which include foreign inland freight/insurance,brokerage and handling/ocean freight, marine insurance, collected exportduties and taxes, uncollected and rebated duties and taxes, U.S. inlandfreight/insurance) with those of other companies under investigation anduse the more adverse information, if available, as best information available.Petitioner points out that respondent used data related to FRG sales toderive the reported foreign inland freight and foreign inland insurancecharges. Petitioner also noted that while the method of calculating homemarket inland freight appeared equally applicable to ESP foreign inlandfreight, INA instead calculated ESP foreign inland freight on the basisof three shipments, which the verification team noted did not seem to berepresentative of the entire period of investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we found that INA-France had appliedan allocation methodology for foreign inland freight and foreign inlandinsurance based on FRG sales data instead of French sales data. Therefore,as best information available, we have used the home market inland freightand home market inland insurance allocations as surrogates for ESP inlandfreight and ESP inland insurance, respectively. Furthermore, we have acceptedINA's allocation for brokerage and handling as best information availablebecause INA could not provide separate allocations for the expenses whichare included in brokerage and handling based on its record-keeping system.<T3>Comment 9.</T3> Petitioner argues that INA-France's home market salesresponse should be rejected because (1) the reported expenses are averagecosts based on 1987 yearly data and cannot be directly tied to specifictransactions; (2) the reported data was aggregated for all products soldduring 1987, including products outside the scope of the investigation.INA-France argues that it is customary for the Department to rely on annualdata to establish the appropriate amount of costs because considerationof a period shorter than a fiscal year could result in a distortion ofthe data by reason of the over-representation of specific costs duringa narrower timeframe. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we reviewed what INA-France reportedas total 1987 turnover and found no major discrepancies. We noted thatINA does not incur its expenses on a regular basis throughout the year.Given the way the expenses were incurred, we find it reasonable to allocateexpenses across a fiscal period. Use of a shorter period would probablyresult in the understating of some expenses and the overstating of others.Also, because INA-France does not maintain its records in such a way toenable it to distinguish its costs for each separate class or kind of merchandise,we found INA's allocation of expenses over total sales of all products,including products not under investigation, to be reasonable. Therefore,we have used INA's information as best information available. <T3>Comment 10.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should notaccept Nachi's revised freight allocations because the errors in the originaltape did not result from a lack of information at the time of responsepreparation. Accordingly, the Department should use the information containedin the original response. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have considered the revised freight allocationsto be timely and an accurate representation of the amount of freight expensesactually incurred. Therefore, we have used the revised figures for inlandfreight. <T3>Comment 11.</T3> Petitioner contends that to the extent that the Departmenthas been unable to trace NMB/Pelmec Singapore's actual charges (<T3>e.g., </T3>movement, brokerage, import duties) allocated to bearingsales during the period of investigation, or an unreasonable methodologyfor allocating these expenses has been utilized, the respondent's datashould be rejected for purposes of the final determination. Furthermore,petitioner takes issue with an alleged calculation error for freight forwardingexpenses incurred in Singapore on U.S. sales of Pelmec ball bearings, andmaintains that the Department should ensure that such errors have beencorrected. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, the allocation methodology usedby NMB/Pelmec Singapore for all movement expenses (<T3>e.g., </T3>freight forwarding, inland freight, import duties, brokerageand handling) was found to be reasonable and an accurate representationof actual charges incurred. Therefore, we have used this information forpurposes of the final determination. Regarding freight forwarding expensesincurred in Singapore on U.S. sales, the statement made in the verificationreport about the calculation error was   incorrect. Only the quantity figurewas found to be slightly lower than what was reported, a difference whichhad no ultimate effect on the per unit charge. Therefore, we have usedthe reported per unit charge in our calculation of U.S. price. <T3>Comment 12.</T3> Petitioner argues that no adjustment should be grantedfor inland freight because NSK allocated freight on the basis of salesvalue which is distortive. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, NSK demonstrated that its methodologywas reasonable and that it was not possible to allocate freight on a weight/volumebasis in a reasonable manner based on its record-keeping system. Therefore,as best information available, we have used NSK's value-based allocationfor purposes of the final determinations. <T3>See, DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 7 </T3>above for further discussion of this issue. <T3>Comment 13.</T3> Petitioner states that NTN incorrectly reported freightcharges based on sales value, rather than on the basis of weight and/orvolume, as the Department requested. Petitioner further contends that NTN'sreporting on the basis of sales value is inherently distortive, in thata very expensive, yet lightweight, bearing might be allocated far morefreight expense than a commodity bearing. To the extent that U.S. salesare at less than fair value, this method allocates smaller freight chargesto parts sold at less than fair value. NTN states that the Department verified why it could not allocate freighton a weight or volume basis; therefore, the Department should accept itsallocation of freight on a sales value basis. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, NTN demonstrated that based onits record-keeping system and verifiable data, its allocation methodologywas reasonable. Though it is preferable to allocate freight expenses ona weight/volume basis, it was not possible for NTN to do so based on theway it keeps its accounting records. During the verification in Japan,NTN explained that in some cases it contracts a truck to go anywhere andcarry any product, regardless of weight or distance, for a fixed periodof time. In other cases often involving the same contractor, NTN is billedbased on the weight or distance of the goods transported. As a result,NTN maintained it would not be possible to break down its freight expenseby weight and distance for particular sales. During the ESP verification,NTN explained that it could not report freight on a weight basis becauseits accounting system is not set up to track freight expenses on a sale-by-salebasis. Product weights are listed in NTN's computer system only for thesubject merchandise and distance to each customer is not recorded. NTNwas unable to devise a rational allocation methodology to account for theweight of each product in each shipment to a given destination. Therefore,as best information available, we have accepted NTN's freight expensesas reported for purposes of these determinations. <T3>See DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 7 </T3>above for further discussion of this issue. <T3>Comment 14. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not allowany deductions from Rose's home market prices for freight and inland insurancebecause Rose did not allocate these expenses to specific sales by weightor by volume. Rose notes that it does not keep records of the weight of its individualproducts and that an allocation on a per unit basis would skew these charges.Therefore, it claims that its allocation based on sales revenue is theonly reasonable method available to it. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified that Rose ships its bearings in mixedbatches and that shipping charges could not be tied directly to individualbearings. Verification confirmed that based on its record-keeping system,Rose could not allocate freight and inland insurance on the basis of weight.Therefore, as best information available, we have accepted Rose's methodologyfor allocating these expenses on a sales value basis. <T3>See, DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 7 </T3>above for further discussion on this issue. <T3>Comment 15. </T3>Petitioner contends that the following charges relatedto sales of SKF-France in the United States should be disallowed: oceanfreight, U.S. inland freight, brokerage and handling, marine insurance,duties, and packing. Petitioner contends that the reported U.S. chargescannot be directly tied to specific transactions and the allocation methodologiesused are incorrect. Petitioner further argues that the Department shoulduse the higher of (1) charges incurred on SKF-USA's sales of merchandisefrom the other countries under investigation, or (2) the charges reportedfrom either of the other two respondents in the investigation of AFBs fromFrance. SKF contends that it has adequately explained or reported all of the expensesnoted by petitioner. Specifically, SKF states the following: (1) SKF-USA'smarine insurance policy covers transportation by air or ocean from Europeto U.S. ports; (2) adjustments for freight are based upon verified information;and (3) U.S. duty was correctly applied to the ex-factory transfer price.SKF-France further contends that they have completely responded to eachof the Department's requests for information and that all charges and adjustmentswhich were not specifically addressed during verification, should be consideredverified. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, SKF-France and SKF-USA demonstratedto our satisfaction that they were unable to consistently and accuratelyreport the above-mentioned charges on a transaction-specific basis. Wedid not examine source documentation and the allocation methodology foreach of the cited charges. However, the examination of selected chargesrevealed that the allocation methodologies used accurately reflected thecharges incurred. Therefore, we have used the amounts reported for eachof the expenses noted above for purposes of these determinations. <T3>Comment 16. </T3>Petitioner contends that SNR's home market inlandfreight and home market inland insurance expenses should not be deductedfrom the home market price for the following reasons: (1) SNR did not reportthese home market charges on a transaction-specific basis; (2) SNR's allocationmethodology was based on 1987 expenses rather than expenses from the periodof investigation; (3) response is inconsistent regarding who assumes thesemovement charges and whether these movement charges are included in orexcluded from the gross unit price; and (4) the Department was unable toverify inland freight expenses or the amounts incurred by SNR for transportationbetween its regional warehouses and its warehouse in Annecy. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In response to petitioner's arguments regardinghome market inland freight, SNR reported these charges on a transaction-specificbasis and we verified those instances where the customer, rather than SNR,paid for freight. Furthermore, we have treated the verified charges fordeliveries between regional warehouses and customers as a direct expense,and the remaining factory to warehouse freight charges verified in Annecyas an indirect expense. In response to petitioner's arguments regardinghome market inland insurance, we verified that it was not possible to reportthese charges on a transaction-specific basis since the insurance policyis paid on a yearly basis. Furthermore, we have verified that inland insurancecharges were excluded from the gross unit price. As for SNR's use of 1987expenses in its allocation methodology for both home market inland freightand inland insurance, even though our request for information and methodologicalpreference is for the reporting of expenses covering the full period ofinvestigation, we have accepted the information as best information available.<T3>Comment 17. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should disallowSNR's reported home market packing expenses because they were based on1987 expenses and were not reported on a transaction-specific basis. Alternatively,if these home market packing charges are used, petitioner argues that theDepartment should disallow industrial packing expenses and the correspondinglabor expenses because these expenses represent new and unverified information.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have allowed SNR's reported home market packingexpenses. Although our request for information and methodological preferenceis for an allocation of packing expenses based on weight, we have determinedthat it is appropriate to accept a value allocation in the case of SNRwhere (l) the number of transactions is very large, (2) the number of variousproducts with different weights and dimensions is great, and (3) numerousbearings of various sizes/weights are often included in a single shipment.It would have been administratively impossible to compile this data ona transaction-by-transaction basis in the time provided for the completionof the response. (<T3>See DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 7</T3>.) Therefore, we have accepted SNR's value-based allocationas the best information available for purposes of these determinations.As for SNR's use of 1987 data for home market packing expenses, even thoughour request for information and methodological preference is for the reportingof expenses covering the full period of investigation, we have acceptedthis data as best information available. However, we did not accept SNR'shome market industrial packing and labor costs since they constituted substantial,new information presented on an untimely basis for proper considerationand analysis. <T3>See, Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan, </T3>54 FR 3099(January 23, 1989). B. Brokerage and Handling Expenses <T3>Comment 18. </T3>Petitioner contends that since FAG-USA imports bearingsboth under and not under investigation, it was not possible to calculatea brokerage and handling expense specific to the subject merchandise. Therefore,the Department should use the higher of the revised, verified charge, orthe highest transaction-specific charge reported by SKF-Italy. FAG-FRG contends that the Department should use FAG-USA's verified brokerageand handling factor.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, we found that FAG-FRG was not ableto calculate a brokerage and handling expense specific to the subject merchandisesince the charges incurred on shipments entering the U.S. during the periodof investigation covered the antifriction bearings under investigationas well as other products. Verification confirmed that FAG-FRG's allocationmethodology was reasonable and, therefore, we have used the revised, verifiedbrokerage and handling expense for purposes of these determinations. <T3>Comment 19. </T3>Petitioner submits that the verification of FAG-Italyestablished that none of its reported brokerage and handling charges caneven be indirectly related to the U.S. sales under investigation. Accordingly,as best information available, the Department should use the higher ofthe revised, verified charge, or the highest transaction-specific chargereported by SKF-Italy. FAG-Italy contends that it properly calculated average brokerage and handlingcosts, as it incurs such expenses on a shipment basis and shipments includeproducts not under investigation. Because the allocation used was not distortive,the Department should use the claimed expenses in the final determinations.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have used FAG-Italy's claimed expenses, as theallocation methodology on which they were based was found to be reasonable.<T3>Comment 20. </T3>Petitioner points out that INA-FRG calculated brokerageand handling expenses by aggregating a number of different expenses, noneof which, according to INA, could be reported separately. Petitioner arguesthat the Department should either apply this expense to the U.S. priceas best information available, or apply the brokerage and handling ratefound for other companies in the FRG exporting to the United States, ifthese rates are higher than those of INA. INA-FRG calculated an allocation rate for movement charges which includedcosts for ocean freight, inland insurance and brokerage and handling. INAargues that the Department should accept this methodology because it wasin place prior to this investigation and is used internally to determinemovement charges. INA maintains that this method of allocation resultsin a per transaction charge that is reasonable and more accurate than couldbe derived by any other means of calculation. In order to demonstrate theDepartment's acceptance of alternative allocation methodologies, INA cites<T3>Color Picture Tubes from Japan </T3>(52 FR 44171, 44180), <T3>Color Television Receivers from Korea </T3>(51 FR 41365), and <T3>Choline Chloride from Canada </T3>(49 FR 36532). <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have accepted INA's allocation as best informationavailable. Due to the manner in which INA keeps its records, there wasno reasonable way to separate brokerage and handling expenses from othermovement expenses. Therefore, INA could not provide separate allocationrates for the individual expenses which are included in brokerage and handling.At verification, we found that INA tracks its movement charges from theEuropean port to its U.S. warehouse using two aggregated rates. One rateis for products shipped from its Schaeffler Walzlager oHG (SWH) plant,and another is for products from all other plants. SWH has its own brokerageand handling rate because it has a sales organization independent of theother plants. Therefore, we have accepted INA's allocation as best informationavailable. <T3>Comment 21. </T3>Petitioner asserts that the Department should reduceSKF-Sweden's U.S. price on the basis of the actual brokerage and handlingcosts for each sale. Petitioner states that in the preliminary determinations,the Department based its reduction on charges which were allocated on thebasis of ex-factory transfer price. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree. The Department verified SKF-Sweden'smovement charge methodology, which uses ex-factory transfer prices, andfound it to be reasonable. Therefore, we are allowing this adjustment toU.S. price for purposes of the final determination. C. Packing <T3>Comment 22. </T3>Petitioner asserts that no deduction for intermediatepacking costs for shipment to a regional warehouse should be granted toFAG-FRG because such costs are an overhead expense and are not directlyrelated to sales under consideration. Petitioner also asserts that no adjustmentshould be made for material or labor expenses for packing claimed by FAG-FRGsince its material expenses were based on June/July 1988 figures and itslabor expenses were based on the 1987 annual figures, neither of whichwere related to the period under review. Furthermore, petitioner maintainsthat packing and freight revenues claimed by FAG-FRG, which represent revenuereceived for special packing on home market sales or for freight paid byany customers, should be added to foreign market value based on the factthat the verification team found no discrepancies with respect to thisclaimed expense. FAG-FRG contends that its use of June/July 1988 data on packing materialcosts in no way distorts the calculation. Likewise, its use of annual 1987labor cost data fully capture annual bonuses and other fringe benefitsthat accrue at different points in the year. Therefore, based on its nondistortivemethodology and verified data, the Department should use FAG-FRG's packingmaterial and labor costs in the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Based on our review of packing costs at verification,we determined that the intermediate packing costs should be consideredpart of packing expenses and, accordingly, we have adjusted the foreignmarket value for home market and U.S. packaging expenses. Regarding FAG-FRG'suse of June/July 1988 data for packing material costs, at verificationFAG management explained that the packing materials records are a minorexpense and are deleted from the system after three months. Although ourrequest for information and methodological preference is for the reportingof expenses covering the full period of investigation, we have acceptedFAG-FRG's use of June/July 1988 data for material expenses and the useof annual 1987 data for labor expenses as best information available. Therefore,we have used the verified packing material and labor costs in our calculations.Furthermore, we agree with petitioner that packing and freight revenueshould be added to foreign market value, and have done so based on thefact that this information was verified.<T3>Comment 23.</T3> FAG-Italy contends that the Department's use of homemarket packing expenses as best information available in its preliminarydeterminations for FAG's alleged failure to report U.S. packing shouldbe reversed for the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> As merchandise sold on an ESP basis passes throughthe FRG in route to the United States, FAG-Italy incurs packing expensesin both Italy and the FRG on behalf of these U.S. sales. FAG-Italy didnot report export packing expenses incurred in Italy since the incurredamount was insignificant. In our preliminary determinations, as a surrogatefor export packing expenses incurred in Italy, we used home market packingexpenses as best   information available. Even though FAG-Italy contendsthat the unreported packing expenses are inconsequential, there is nothingon the record to document that claim. Therefore, for these determinations,we have considered export packing expenses incurred in Italy as representativeof the export packing expense incurred in the FRG and have included thatamount in the overall export packing expense. <T3>Comment 24.</T3> Petitioner points out that packing costs incurredby INA-FRG and INA-France in shipping the subject merchandise from thecountry of manufacture to the United States were not considered in theU.S. packing expense. Because of this fact, petitioner argues that, asbest information available, the Department should deduct both INA's U.S.and home market packing costs from the U.S. price. Alternatively, petitionermaintains that for INA-FRG's packing expenses the Department should usethe highest packing rate for U.S. sales reported by any German companyin this investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we found that the U.S. packingexpense reported by INA-FRG and INA-France included only the costs forrepacking in the United States. INA did not include the packing costs incurredin shipping the merchandise from Germany and France to the United States.Therefore, we used the home market packing expense which we calculatedbased on verified data as the best information available for the U.S. packingexpense. This expense was applied to the home market price in the calculationof foreign market value. Expenses incurred for repacking in the UnitedStates were treated as direct selling expenses and deducted from the U.S.price. <T3>Comment 25.</T3> Petitioner contends that, because Minebea Japan failedto report accurate information regarding packing costs, the Departmentshould assume, as best information available, that packing costs are identicalin the U.S. and Japanese markets and should make no adjustment for differencesin packing costs. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> During verification, we discovered that MinebeaJapan inadvertently failed to report expenses associated with packing themerchandise at the factory for both home market and U.S. sales. The packingexpenses reported in the response were those expenses associated with repackingthe merchandise for delivery to home market customers only. Therefore,as best information available, we have assumed that packing costs are thesame for both home market and U.S. sales and have made no adjustment fordifferences in packing costs. <T3>Comment 26.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should not allowany deduction from home market price for packing because SKF-UK's packingdata did not verify. SKF-UK maintains that the packing adjustment containedin the verification exhibits is correct. SKF-UK argues that the Departmenthas accepted minor changes at verification in past cases and that the errorfound at verification was minor. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with petitioner. SKF-UK reported that thematerial cost portion of packing cost was comprised of several components.At verification, we were unable to satisfactorily trace any one of thesecomponents back to source documentation. Additionally, more material componentswere added to the total material cost portion. When we attempted to verifythe labor cost portion of the packing cost, we found that the supportingdocumentation was based on labor costs in an area where packing was notperformed. Because both home market and export sales undergo similar packingprocedures, and packing costs for all sales were not verified, we havemade no adjustment for packing. <T3>Comment 27.</T3> SKF-Italy contends that it made a mathematical errorin its calculation of warehouse packing. This error was corrected and wasbrought to the Department's attention prior to verification. The revisedinformation was verified. Based on established Department practice, SKFclaims that this information is acceptable and should be used in the finaldeterminations. To show that the Department has in the past allowed minorrevisions  to the questionnaire responses after the preliminary determinationand during verification, SKF cites <T3>Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklifts from Japan,</T3>53 FR 12552 (April 15, 1988). <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The revisions to warehouse packing expenses incurredin Italy for U.S. sales were minor and did not involve any change in themethodology reported prior to verification. Because they were brought toour attention at the beginning of verification, we were able to verifythe revised information, and have used that information for purposes ofthese determinations. D. Marine/Inland Insurance <T3>Comment 28.</T3> Petitioner contends that FAG-Italy's claimed homemarket inland insurance costs were not verified and, therefore, cannotbe used for the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The purpose of verification is to spot-check therespondent's questionnaire response and is not intended to be an exhaustiveexamination of the response. <T3>See, Monsanto Company</T3> v. <T3>the United States,</T3> 698 F. Supp. 285 (CIT l988). A1though FAG-Italy'sinland insurance expense was not examined during verification, we haveaccepted the claimed expenses for purposes of the final determinationsbecause we found that FAG-Italy's response was generally accurate and reasonable.Furthermore, the claimed expenses for inland insurance represented a minisculeamount of overall home market expenses. <T3>Comment 29.</T3> Petitioner contends that since the insurance policycharge claimed by RHP covers inland insurance and marine insurance on aworldwide basis, it should be allocated over all sales including overseassales. Petitioner further contends that, where U.S. price is based on purchaseprice, there is no basis for any deduction for these expenses, which areindirect expenses, because adjustments may be made to purchase price onlyfor expenses directly related to the sales under consideration. RHP contends that, contrary to petitioner's assertion, the expense fortransit insurance was allocated over total sales. Furthermore, respondentstates that it does not object to petitioner's argument that transit insurancepremiums be treated as indirect selling expenses as long as this approachis consistently applied to home market, purchase price, and exporter'ssales price transactions. If the Department were to adopt this methodology,transit insurance should be deducted from the home market and ESP pricesbut not from purchase price. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> RHP reported, and the Department verified, thatits claim for transit insurance was allocated over total sales. We haveallowed an adjustment for transit insurance on purchase price sales becausethe transit insurance expense is a movement expense for transporting themerchandise from the factory to the U.K. port. Petitioner's argument thatthere is no basis for any deduction for these indirect expenses is withoutmerit since the Department has consistently treated transit insurance asa movement charge and deducted such expenses from purchase price sales.<T3>Comment 30.</T3> Petitioner argues that, to the extent SKF-Sweden'smarine insurance charge on U.S. sales covers only shipments made by ocean,the cost of any insurance covering air shipment should be computed anddeducted from U.S. price. SKF-USA contends that the marine insurance policy covers transportationby air or ocean from Europe to U.S. ports. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Although SKF-Sweden's marine insurance expense wasnot examined during verification, we have accepted SKF's claim and explanationfor purposes of the final determination because we found that SKF-Sweden'sresponse was generally accurate and reasonable. The purpose of verificationis to assess the overall accuracy of the respondent's questionnaire responseand is not intended to be an exhaustive examination of the response. <T3>See, Monsanto Company </T3>v.<T3> the United States, </T3>698 F. Supp. 285 (CIT l988). E. Import Duties <T3>Comment 31.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should deductcustoms charges identified as ``merchandise processing fees'' and ``harbormaintenance fees'' from U.S. price on NTN's purchase price and ESP transactions.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have deducted these expenses from U.S. pricewhere we have used ESP as the basis for U.S. price. Since we did not makecomparisons involving purchase price transactions, the issue of whethersuch expenses should be deducted from U.S. price in the case of purchaseprice transactions is moot. <T3>Comment 32.</T3> Petitioner contends that the duty deducted from U.S.price on SKF-Sweden's U.S. sales should be calculated on the basis of theTSUSA duty rates and should be applied to all transactions for each classor kind of merchandise. SKF-Sweden contends that petitioner misunderstands SKF-USA's reportingof duty paid on imports and that the U.S. duty was calculated in the samemanner as it was incurred. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Although the duties claimed on SKF-Sweden's U.S.sales were not examined during verification, we have accepted the amountsreported for purposes of the final determination because we found thatSKF-Sweden's response was generally accurate. As stated in the <T3>DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 28 </T3>and <T3>Comment 30 </T3>in the Marine/Inland Insurance section above, the purposeof verification is to assess the overall accuracy of the respondent's questionnaireresponse and is not intended to be an exhaustive examination of the response.F. Inland Freight <T3>Comment 33.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should denyan adjustment to Nachi's foreign market value for inland freight to deliverycenters because the charges were not incurred pursuant to a contract anddid not constitute a ``term of sale.'' <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Nachi reported two types of inland freight: (1)Inland freight to a customer and (2) inland freight to a warehouse or deliverycenter. Because the inland freight to a warehouse or delivery center occurredbefore the date of sale, we treated such charges as indirect expenses.<T3>Comment 34.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should excludefreight charges from the calculation of foreign market value for Nachi'sinland freight on returned merchandise because such freight expenses arenot related to the sale of the merchandise. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Nachi's allocation of inland freight expenses includedfreight charges on returned merchandise. For purposes of the final determination,we have made a downward adjustment to Nachi's claimed home market inlandfreight expenses to take into account the expenses relating to the returnedmerchandise. <T3>Comment 35.</T3> Petitioner argues that no adjustment should be grantedfor NSK's inland freight because the reported freight costs included suchnon-freight charges as office courier expenses, fuel expenses at deliverycenters, the cost of transferring items between various NSK plants, andfreight for returns of merchandise from NSK's customers. In addition, theamount reported by NSK for foreign inland insurance was actually for fireand casualty insurance to NSK's property, rather than a movement expense.Further, the inland freight amount claimed includes freight from the factoryto the distribution center, which is not a proper adjustment since thedate of sale is the date of shipment from the distribution centers. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, NSK corrected its reported homemarket freight expenses to exclude the non-freight costs. However, we agreewith petitioner that the portion of the inland freight expense in the homemarket attributable to factory-to-warehouse transportation should not betreated as a direct expense. Because NSK did not break out the inland freightexpense to allow us to segregate the portion attributable to pre-sale transportation,we have treated the entire amount as an indirect expense. As for the amountreported for foreign inland insurance, we have excluded the amount attributableto the fire and casualty insurance premium. <T3>Comment 36.</T3> Petitioner contends that NTN's reported freight expensescontain an amount for transportation between the factory and distributioncenters, and that this portion of the freight expense is not permittedunder <T3>Silver Reed America, Inc., </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>7  CIT 23, 34 (1984), nor is it in accordance withthe Department's practice, citing <T3>Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan, </T3>53 FR 40937 (1988).Petitioner further argues that, since the date of sale in the home marketis the date of shipment, freight expenses to NTN's distribution centersare by definition a pre-sale expense. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with petitioner that the freight expensesto NTN's distribution centers are pre-sale expenses, and have treated theportion of the inland freight expense in the home market attributable tofactory-to-warehouse transportation as an indirect expense. Where a respondentfailed to break out the inland freight information to allow us to segregatethe portion attributable to factory-to-warehouse, as in the case of NSK,we have treated the entire amount as an indirect expense. (<T3>See, DOC Position </T3>to <T3>Comment 35 </T3>above.) In the case of NTN, from the information submittedon the record, we have calculated the average ratio of factory freightexpenses to total freight expenses by type of customer. As best informationavailable, we have assumed that all factory freight expenses are to warehousesand considered this portion to be a pre-sale expense. Accordingly, we deductedfrom the total home market inland freight claim the amount of the pre-salefreight expense, and have treated this portion of the claimed expense asan indirect expense.<T3>Comment 37.</T3> Petitioner submits that the inland freight claimedby SKF-France for home market sales by Clamart (an SKF company in France)erroneously included freight charges from Clamart's factory to the warehouse,which should be considered overhead. In addition, petitioner states thatthe domestic freight expense includes all charges for inland freight paidby Clamart and that total shipping weight is the weight of all productssold in France, whether or not produced by Clamart. Petitioner contendsthat Clamart's freight revenue was similarly distorted. Therefore, petitionerargues, the Department should disallow the deduction for inland freighton Clamart's home market sales. SKF-France argues that charges for inland freight from Clamart's factoryto the warehouse on home market sales comprise only a small percentageof Clamart's total freight costs per quarter. SKF-France argues that theDepartment verified inland freight revenue. SKF-France further argues thatthe freight revenue and shipping weight are reported for domestic salesof products both domestically produced and imported. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>SKF-France erroneously claimed factory-to-warehousefreight charges as adjustments to the foreign market value. SKF-France'spost-verification approximation of factory-to-warehouse charges, submitteda month after the verification report was released and over two monthsafter verification, was untimely. Moreover, SKF-France's allocation methodologytook into account sales of merchandise not subject to the investigations(<T3>i.e., </T3>imported bearings from SKF companies in other European countries)that SKF-France had already demonstrated it could separate from the salesunder investigation. The Department was not able to verify SKF-France'sinland freight charges in the home market claimed for the subject merchandiseproduced by Clamart, and therefore has not deducted them from foreign marketvalue. This decision does not affect home market inland freight chargesclaimed by ADR, which the Department has verified. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 12: Credit and Inventory Carrying Costs </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not deductinventory carrying costs incurred in the home market from foreign marketvalue or U.S. price. Petitioner states that an adjustment for inventorycarrying costs is properly made to ESP transactions for ``time on water''and for time in inventory in the United States because the foreign parentis financing its U.S. subsidiary's costs. Petitioner contends that theDepartment should treat these expenses differently because in the homemarket, these types of expenses are incurred entirely at the discretionof the foreign seller which can either choose to produce to order or tosell from inventory. Therefore, if the foreign seller elects to hold merchandisein inventory in the home market, the costs of doing so are in the natureof overhead rather than selling expenses. Moreover, petitioner disagrees with the Department's more recent practiceof beginning the period for computing inventory carrying costs from thedate of production (<T3>See, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: IndustrialPhosphoric Acid from Belgium </T3>(52 FR 25436, July 7, 1987) and <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Industrial ForkliftTrucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR 12552, April 15, 1988).) Petitioner assertsthat the reason the Department originally began to take inventory carryingcosts into account was its concern that expenses could be shifted fromthe books of the related selling subsidiary in the United States to thebooks of the foreign parent. Under this scenario, petitioner states thatthe Department determined the appropriate period for calculating when suchexpenses can be shifted back to the parent as being between the dates ofshipment and payment, rather than between the dates of production and payment.Further, petitioner states that while the deduction of inventory carryingcosts from both ESP and foreign market value achieves parity, it goes beyondwhat the Department originally set out to do. Petitioner also contendsthat such a methodology also leads to greater distortion in the treatmentof purchase price versus ESP sales. Therefore, petitioner argues, the Department should (1) limit its adjustmentfor inventory carrying costs to the U.S. side of the equation and (2) begincalculating the adjustment from the date the product is shipped from thehome country. Petitioner requests that if the Department continues thepractice followed in the cases cited above, it should at least articulateits rationale due to the wedge it drives between purchase price and ESPtransactions. Respondents state that there is no justification for the Department todepart from its well-established practice of treating inventory carryingcosts as an indirect selling expense. Respondents claim that the Department'simputed inventory interest adjustment reflecting the opportunity cost ofholding inventory, is incurred on U.S., third country, and home markettransactions. Respondents cite <T3>Smith Corona Group, Consumer Products Div., SCM Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>713 F.2d 1568, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1983), <T3>cert. den., </T3>465 U.S. 1022 (1984) and <T3>Silver Reed America, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-37, <T2>XXX</T2> CIT <T2>XXX</T2> (March 18, 1988) to support their contention that the adjustmentmust be made to all markets if the Department's calculations are to providea true apples-to-apples comparison and to allow for an equitable pricecomparison in all markets. Respondents state that petitioner's argument that the cost of inventoryin the home market is not an indirect selling expense, while the cost ofinventory in the United States is an indirect selling expense, is completelyillogical. Respondents maintain that it should be treated as an indirectselling expense in the ESP calculation and included in the ESP offset adjustmentcap as prescribed by Commerce regulation andSection; 353.15(c). Respondentsstate that inventory is inventory wherever it is held and that the Departmentshould reject petitioner's argument and use the methodology employed inthe final determinations of <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished,from Japan </T3>(52 FR 30700, August 17, 1987), <T3>Industrial Phosphoric Acid from Belgium </T3>(52 FR 25436, July 7,1987), and <T3>Digital Readout Systems from Japan, </T3>(53 FR 47844, November 28,1988). <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with respondents. While the Department'soriginal adjustment for inventory carrying costs may have been motivatedby concerns that costs normally borne by a U.S. subsidiary could be shiftedto the foreign parent, in order for comparisons to be fair, it is necessaryto make similar adjustments to foreign market value. That the foreign sellerchooses to sell from inventory in the home market is no different froma seller's decision to undertake ESP transactions in the United States.Because the seller incurs the opportunity cost of holding inventory inboth markets, and because we adjust for that cost in the U.S. market, wemust also adjust for the same cost in the home market.Given that we make an adjustment on both sides of the equation, we havedetermined that the starting point for measuring inventory carrying costsfor both sides should be the same. Ideally, we would start at the pointwhere home market and U.S. merchandise are separated, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the last common point of the production/distribution chainfor home market and U.S. merchandise. In many cases, such as in these investigations,this will be when the merchandise rolls off the production line. With respect to the alleged wedge this methodology drives between ESP andpurchase price transactions, we disagree with petitioner's underlying premisethat the purpose of the inventory carrying cost adjustment is to ``transform''an ESP sales price into the price that would have been charged had thesale been made directly to an unrelated purchaser in the United States,<T3>i.e., </T3>a purchase price sale. The Act requires many adjustmentsto ESP transactions that are not required to be made to purchase pricetransactions, and fairness requires that when the inventory carrying costadjustment is made to ESP, it must also be made to foreign market value.<T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should use therevised allocation rate for inventory carrying costs which INA-FRG reportedin its November 8, 1988 submission. Petitioner asserts that the revisedrate was based on actual interest expense. INA-FRG argues that the Department should use the allocation methodologyit first presented to the Department, <T3>i.e., </T3>dividing its interest costs by the value of assets, andnot the methodology provided on November 8, 1988 at the Department's instructions,<T3>i.e.,</T3> using an effective interest rate and an average time ininventory including inventory time in the FRG. However, INA-FRG arguesthat if the Department uses the revised methodology, it should use theFRG short-term interest rate for the period of time the product remainedin inventory in the FRG. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We used verified information regarding the averagenumber of days in U.S. inventory and average U.S. interest expense duringthe POI. For time in inventory in the FRG and in transit, INA-FRG estimatedan amount which it was unable to substantiate at verification. Therefore,we used verified home market information to determine an amount of timein inventory in the FRG. This information included data on all productsheld in inventory for both domestic and export sales. Because we had noinformation on time in transit, as best information available we used thenumber of days in ocean transit for another company under investigationin the FRG. We added together the number of days in inventory in the FRGand in ocean transit and multiplied this amount by the verified FRG short-terminterest rate. This was added to the inventory carrying costs incurredin the United States to determine the new inventory carrying costs on ESPtransactions. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> SKF-Sweden states that the necessary change in theapplication of its inventory carrying cost factor to the per unit pricehas been made in its revised computer tapes. SKF-Sweden therefore contendsthat, as the underlying data for this revision have been verified and thechange is <T3>de minimis</T3> both in scope and effect, the revised factors shouldbe applied in making the inventory carrying cost adjustment to SKF-Sweden'sprices. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree. SKF-Sweden reported inventory carryingcosts for home market and export sales based on the average time in inventoryfor products in both its international and domestic warehouses. At verificationin Sweden, we found that export sales are only processed through the internationalwarehouse. SKF-Sweden has, therefore, properly deducted the average timein inventory in Sweden for export sales attributable to the domestic warehouse.Because all data had been reported prior to verification and was verified,we have allowed this minor change to the data base. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> SKF-UK asserts that it correctly calculated home marketinventory carrying cost based on the instructions in the Department's questionnaireand that this information was verified. SKF-UK states that it calculatedinventory carrying cost from the date of production to the date of shipmentin accordance with the Department's decision in <T3>Forklifts from Japan.</T3> Therefore, respondent argues that the Departmentshould accept its calculation as reported. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Prior to verification, SKF-UK reported that homemarket inventory carrying cost was based on time in inventory in the internationalwarehouse. At verification, SKF-UK claimed that products sold in the homemarket spend additional time in a domestic warehouse and wanted to increasethe inventory carrying cost for those sales accordingly. Because we determinedthat the information regarding additional time in warehouse constitutednew information and a revised methodology, we verified only the time spentin the international warehouse that was originally reported. We, therefore,have allowed SKF-UK's claimed adjustment for inventory carrying cost basedon the information submitted prior to verification. <T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioner argues that, because none of the RHP inventorymaintained by the European sales division or international sales divisionis related to home market sales, the Department should not account forany expenses associated with such inventories. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> RHP based its calculation of home market inventorycarrying cost on the value of the inventory carried by both the Industrialand Precision Divisions during the POI. RHP does not maintain separateinventory records for merchandise destined to be sold outside of the UnitedKingdom and merchandise destined for sale in its home market. Each divisionof RHP maintains its own inventory records of the merchandise it has instock. Therefore, the Department has used the inventory carrying cost informationsubmitted by RHP and verified by the Department. <T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner argues that FAG-Italy's claimed costs forimputed credit were based on 1987 data, which has no fixed relationshipto costs incurred during the second half of the POI, and should, therefore,not be used by the Department. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> For its calculation of inventory carrying costs,FAG-Italy used an average short-term interest rate, and an average numberof days in inventory, based on data covering the entire POI. To derivean average cost of inventory, FAG-Italy used 1987 data only. While we requestedand prefer that expenses covering the entire POI be included in the calculationof inventory carrying costs, we have accepted the FAG-Italy 1987 valuationas best information available. <T3>Comment 7.</T3> Petitioner contends that the interest rate used tocalculate credit expenses and inventory carrying costs on Minebea Japan'sU.S. sales should be based on NMB-USA's actual cost of borrowing ratherthan the average inter-company rate verified by the Department. Petitionermaintains that the interest rate charged by a corporation to its wholly-ownedsubsidiary must be presumed not to be at arm's-length. Therefore, as bestinformation available, the Department should use the greater of eitherthe rate reported by NMB-USA or the U.S. prime rate in calculating bothU.S. credit expenses and U.S. inventory carrying costs.Minebea Japan maintains that it reported the short-term average interestrate received from unrelated lenders, which the Department verified. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with respondent. We found at verificationthat the loans used to calculate the U.S. short-term interest rate werefrom unrelated lenders. These loans consisted of short-term commercialbank loans and commercial paper loans. The interest rates charged on thecommercial paper loans consisted of the interest expense plus a cost mark-up,which is an inter-company commission but is treated as a loan for financialpurposes. Because this mark-up increases the interest expense on U.S. sales,which thereby increases the interest rate, we have determined that therate reported by Minebea Japan and verified by the Department is an appropriateinterest rate to use in the calculation of U.S. credit expenses and U.S.inventory carrying costs for Minebea Japan, NMB/Pelmec Singapore, and NMB/PelmecThai. <T3>Comment 8.</T3> Petitioner maintains that imputed inventory carryingcosts on NMB/Pelmec Singapore's U.S. sales have been understated. Petitionerasserts that NMB/Pelmec Singapore failed to report average standing timein Singapore prior to shipment. Petitioner maintains that this expensemust be deducted from ESP. Furthermore, petitioner states that if the Department does deduct inventorycarrying costs from foreign market value, the reported inventory carryingcosts should be recalculated pursuant to the Department's methodology,<T3>i.e.,</T3> transit time and standing time should be calculated basedon the interest rate in Singapore. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification in Singapore, we verified the averagetime from date of production to date of shipment from Singapore. This averagetime in inventory has been included in the calculation of U.S. inventorycarrying costs.We also have deducted inventory carrying costs from foreign market value(<T3>see,</T3> Comment 1 above). For purposes of this rate for calculation,we used the Singaporean short-term interest rate for time in inventoryin Singapore. However, because we verified that title to the products changedhands at the Singapore port, we have used the corresponding Japanese interestrate for time in transit.<T3>Comment 9.</T3> NSK claims that the Department should calculate theimputed credit expense for inventory carrying costs on U.S. sales on thebasis of NSK's home market short-term borrowing rate because the parentcompany incurs the full costs of carrying the inventory of products importedinto the United States. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department disagrees with NSK's contention thatthe Japanese parent company incurs the full expense of carrying the inventoryof products imported into the United States. At verification, we determinedthat the U.S. subsidiary records the goods from Japan into its inventoryas of the bill of lading date, which was also consistent with its auditedfinancial statement. Consequently, we have calculated the ESP inventorycarrying cost by applying the U.S. interest rate for the average time periodfrom bill of lading to sale to the first unrelated purchaser in the UnitedStates, as reported by NSK. <T3>Comment 10.</T3> Petitioner claims FAG-Italy erroneously reported U.S.short-term interest rates based on the period ending December 31, 1987.Since this does not represent the rate for the entire POI, petitioner contendsthat the Department should use the U.S. prime lending rate for the POIas a reasonable estimate of short-term borrowing rates on U.S. sales. FAG-Italy contends that it properly calculated an average interest ratebased on actual short-term interest costs incurred during the entire POI.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We used the verified average interest rate, whichwas based on actual short-term interest costs incurred during the entirePOI. <T3>Comment 11.</T3> Petitioner claims that for sales where FAG-Italy hasnot yet received payment as of the date of the ESP verification, the dateof verification should be used as the payment date on such transactions.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree. For those sales where payment was notreceived as of the date of verification, credit expenses were calculatedusing customer-specific data on the average number of days accounts wereoutstanding. <T3>Comment 12.</T3> Petitioner contends that FAG-Italy's calculation ofhome market credit expenses based on average credit terms extended to homemarket customers permits FAG-Italy to adjust foreign market value irrespectiveof the diverse terms of payment accorded to different types of customers.FAG-Italy asserts that use of customer-specific average credit days outstandingin no way distorts the credit calculation as foreign market value itselfis based on averages for sales over the six-month POI. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department prefers to have credit reported ona transaction-by-transaction basis. However, given the massive number oftransactions in these investigations, we do not consider a methodologybased on average credit days outstanding on a customer-specific basis tobe unreasonable. At verification, we determined that FAG-Italy based itscredit amount claimed on a customer-specific average due to the mannerin which the records were kept. We note that this methodology does takeinto account the different terms of payment accorded to different typesof customers. Therefore, we are using FAG-Italy's credit costs, as reportedand verified, in these final determinations. <T3>Comment 13.</T3> Petitioner maintains that FAG-Italy and FAG-FRG'sU.S. credit costs are understated in the case of multiple payments againstone invoice since the reported payment date is the date of the first paymentand the last payment may not have been captured within the reporting timeframe. Petitioner contends that FAG-Italy's verification report providesno discussion of how sales with multiple payment dates were verified. Accordingly,the Department should use the date of the last payment since FAG-Italyis incurring credit costs on transactions with multiple payment dates.Additionally, petitioner claims that for those transactions for which anoutside shipping service was used, the information did not verify and,hence, the Department should use best information available. FAG-FRG contends that petitioner has failed to present any cogent basisfor substituting best information available for U.S. reported credit costs.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We verified that in situations involving multiplepayments, if all payments had been received by the date of verification,the reported credit amounts reflect actual credit experience. For thoseportions where payment had not been received as of the date of verification,credit expenses were calculated using customer-specific data on the averagenumber of days accounts were outstanding. We consider this methodologyto be a reasonable representation of credit experience and have used itin these final determinations. Verification confirmed that the manner in which shipment date was determinedon merchandise shipped by an outside shipping service was reasonable. Therefore,we have used the verified credit costs on these shipments for purposesof the final determinations. <T3>Comment 14.</T3> Petitioner contends that the weighted-average paymentterm calculated for the sales examined at verification should be appliedto all home market sales for Minebea Japan and all third country salesfor NMB/Pelmec Singapore in calculating credit expenses, rather than thepayment terms reported in the responses which were based on Minebea Japan'saverage age of accounts receivable. Minebea Japan and NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintain that the calculation ofhome market credit expenses based upon the weighted-average of accountsreceivable is the only way of estimating the number of days an accountis outstanding in instances where the company maintains an open accountssystem. With respect to the apparent discrepancy between the average numberof days reported in the responses and the average as calculated by theDepartment at verification, respondents maintain that the Department'scalculation fails to take into account the period for which promissorynotes are outstanding on these sales, which is a necessary element in calculatingthe average number of days that credit is extended. In support of its argument,NMB/Pelmec Singapore cites <T3>Nylon Impression Fabric from Japan, </T3>a case in which the Departmentrecognized the period for which promissory notes are outstanding as a legitimatepart of credit claims. Furthermore, Minebea Japan and NMB/Pelmec Singaporemaintain that the Department's weighted-average calculation is based onan inadequate sample.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified the actual number of days payment wasoutstanding on selected sales in order to ascertain whether the averageage of accounts receivable methodology used to calculate Minebea Japan'shome market credit expense and NMB/Pelmec Singapore's third country expensewas a reasonable estimation of actual experience. Because the reportednumber of credit days fell within the range of the actual days outstandingfor the sample sales verified, we have accepted respondents' average ageof accounts receivable methodology and used the figures reported in theresponses for purposes of the final determinations. <T3>Comment 15. </T3>Petitioner contends that the new home market interestrate calculation presented by Minebea Japan and NMB/Pelmec Singapore atverification should not be used by the Department because these new interestrates were not included in the original questionnaire responses and werenot provided in a timely manner. To calculate Minebea Japan's home marketcredit expense, petitioner suggests that the Department use the averageborrowing rate reported in the response, which was based on the averageoutstanding loan balance for long- and short-term bank loans and long-termbonds. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>During verification, we discovered that the calculationof the home market interest rate for Minebea Japan and NMB/Pelmec Singaporeincluded long-term loans. We requested that respondents revise the interestrate based solely on short-term financing. Because this interest rate wasverified, we have recalculated home market credit expense for Minebea Japanand third country credit expense incurred on NMB/Pelmec Singapore's salesto Japan and inventory carrying costs accordingly. However, we did notallow for compensating balances in the interest rate calculation becauseMinebea Japan did not document or otherwise sufficiently demonstrate thatdeposits in Japanese banks were a requirement for its commercial loans.<T3>Comment 16. </T3>Petitioner contends that the credit period on NMB/PelmecThai's related party transactions was incorrectly reported. Therefore,if the Department uses such sales in its analysis, the home market creditadjustment should be based on the actual number of days from shipment topayment. Further, petitioner contends that the Department should rejectthe interest rate used in the calculation of NMB/Pelmec Thai's home marketcredit expense because it included both long-term loans and export packingcredit loans. Instead, the Department should use the corrected interestrate which was verified. Petitioner also asserts that NMB/Pelmec Thai's method of calculating U.S.credit expenses on an average credit period may understate the actual creditcosts incurred on U.S. sales. Therefore, the Department should insist onan identification of the actual credit period on a transaction-by-transactionbasis, or double the average period as best information available. NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that it correctly reported, and the Departmentverified, the average credit period for related party sales. NMB/PelmecThai asserts that the Department should use the reported credit periodbased on the average age of accounts receivable methodology, rather thanthe calculation provided in the verification report because (1) the Department'scalculation was based on a few selected transactions while respondent'scalculation was based on the whole universe of sales, and (2) the calculationprovided in the verification report omitted the price term which is a necessaryelement in calculating the average number of days that credit is extended.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>Because we have determined that the Thai home marketwas not viable, we have based foreign market value on constructed value,as best information available. Therefore, we need not address petitioner'sarguments regarding related home market sales and the home market short-terminterest rate. With respect to petitioner's comment on U.S. credit expenses, we verifiedthe actual number of days payment was outstanding on selected sales inorder to ascertain whether the average age of accounts receivable methodologyused by NMB/Pelmec Thai was a reasonable estimation of actual experience.Because the reported number of credit days fell within the range of theactual days outstanding for the sample sales verified, we have acceptedrespondent's average age of accounts receivable methodology and used thefigures reported in the response for purposes of the final determinations.<T3>Comment 17. </T3>Petitioner argues that INA-France's home market creditexpenses should be recalculated on the basis of days credit was extendedand the short-term average interest rate actually paid. Petitioner assertsthat this should be done because of the following problems with respondent'smethodology: (1) INA-France had the ability to calculate credit expenseon a transaction-by-transaction basis, (2) the data INA-France used wasfor the calendar year 1987 and, thus, cannot be directly related to salesmade during the POI, and (3) the total cost of short-term borrowing includescommissions paid to banks for short-term credit. Petitioner stated thatif the 1987 data was used for the interest rate, it should be net of commissions.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with petitioner that INA-France had theability to calculate home market credit expense on a transaction-by-transactionbasis. Therefore, the Department recalculated credit for each transactionusing the average short-term interest rate net of commissions and the actualnumber of days credit was outstanding for the transaction. While we requestedand prefer that expenses covering the entire POI be included in the creditcalculation, we have accepted the INA-France data as best information available.<T3>Comment 18. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should use theU.S. credit expense reported by INA-France in its November 8, 1988 submission,as opposed to the rate INA-France originally reported. Petitioner pointsout that the original calculation was based on total interest expense dividedby total assets. Petitioner states that this reduces the interest expenseby including equity, as well as revenues, in the denominator. The secondmethodology was based on INA-France's average percentage interest expense.Petitioner argues that the second method represents a more accurate measureof actual interest expense on U.S. sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree and are using INA-France's revised U.S.credit expense allocation rate in these final determinations. <T3>Comment 19. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should makeno adjustment to INA-FRG's foreign market value for credit expense forthe following reasons: (1) INA-FRG failed to provide actual interest expenseincurred on a transaction-by-transaction basis, although the company'srecords of shipment and payment allowed it to do so, (2) INA-FRG's allocationwas based on an unverified estimate of domestic sales, and (3) INA-FRG'sinterest expense was based in part on sales and expenses associated withproducts not under investigation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We found at verification that INA-FRG had the abilityto calculate credit expense on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Therefore,the Department recalculated credit for each transaction using the verifiedaverage short-term interest rate and the actual number of days credit wasoutstanding for the transaction. The domestic sales value used in the allocationwas verified and a minor correction was made. We also noted at verificationthat respondent does not classify its expenses according to the class orkind criteria delineated by the Department. <T3>Comment 20. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department establishedat verification that GMN's home market credit expenses were not reportedor calculated correctly. Accordingly, the Department should not make anyadjustment to foreign market value for new credit expense information whichwas received at verification. GMN asserts that the Department should use GMN's home market calculationof average credit days submitted on November 8, 1988. GMN argues that itshome market credit cost calculation is appropriate since its methodologyfor computing credit costs and the data relied upon to establish the averagenumber of days credit was extended was verified. Respondent contends thatthe Department cannot use an average credit period that was based on areview at verification of the pre-selected home market sales and a fewrandomly selected sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department has rejected GMN's original calculationsince it discovered at verification that GMN's calculation included datarelated to sales of merchandise not under investigation. The inclusionof sales not under investigation distorted the actual average credit periodon the products under investigation. We found at verification that theaverage credit period on GMN ball bearing sales in the home market wasconsistently much less than GMN had originally reported. Therefore, forpurposes of these final determinations, the Department has used an averagecredit period based upon its own extensive review of sales at verification.<T3>Comment 21. </T3>GMN contends that if the Department considers onlyshort-term loans for purposes of determining a home market interest rate,then the Department must add bank charges to short-term credit expenses.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department has used a revised interest ratebased on the short-term borrowing of GMN net of bank charges. The interestrate GMN originally reported was based on the total bank debt of GMN, includingboth long- and short-term borrowing and related bank charges. Because theverified U.S. interest rate is void of bank charges, we have used a homemarket interest rate net of bank charges for home market credit and inventorycarrying cost, to insure consistency between the home market and the U.S.interest rates. <T3>Comment 22. </T3>Petitioner contends that SNR does not track home marketcredit days. Therefore, the Department should use the standard credit daysoffered to home market customers as best information available. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>To calculate credit expense for these final determinations,we have used SNR's average number of credit days for OEMs and distributorsas reported and verified.<T3>Comment 23. </T3>Petitioner asserts that interest earned on a bankaccount is not the proper interest rate to use in calculating home marketcredit expense for SKF-Sweden. Petitioner further asserts that the Departmentwas unable to verify the number of credit days outstanding in the homemarket. Therefore, petitioner argues, the Department should not allow anadjustment to FMV for credit costs and should assume that U.S. credit costsare equal to home market credit costs. In the event that the Departmentdoes allow a credit cost adjustment to FMV, petitioner argues that theinterest rate used should be the average short-term interest debt rateof the other companies under investigation and that the credit cost amountmust be reduced by the amount of income received in the form of late paymentinterest charges. SKF-Sweden argues that the interest earned on its bank account is the properinterest rate to measure SKF-Sweden's credit expense. Since SKF-Swedenhad no short-term debt during the POI, the opportunity cost of its paymentterms should be measured by the interest it could have earned from thereceivables which were outstanding. SKF-Sweden also argues that petitioner'ssuggestion to use the average short-term rate of other companies underinvestigation is not appropriate because SKF-Sweden is the only companyin Sweden under investigation. Furthermore, SKF-Sweden contends that using an average number of creditdays to calculate credit expenses in the situation where actual paymentdays were not available does not distort or increase SKF-Sweden's creditcosts and that the Department should use the verified figure in the calculationof credit expenses. SKF-Sweden submits that its credit expense data arereliable and have been verified and thus, are more accurate than petitioner'sassumption that U.S. credit costs are equal. DOC Position. We verified that SKF-Sweden incurred no short-term debt duringthe POI. We also verified the short-term interest rate SKF-Sweden earnedon its bank account. We have determined that this interest rate is thebest evidence of SKF-Sweden's short-term borrowing costs during the POI.At verification, SKF-Sweden claimed that it had allocated interest revenuefrom late payment by customers to all home market sales because it wasnot possible to trace such revenue to specific sales. We have added thereported interest revenue to the home market net price. We have also acceptedthe use of an average number of credit days as a reasonable approximationof credit days outstanding for those sales where actual payment had notyet been received. <T3>Comment 24. </T3>SKF-UK argues that the interest rate established atthe cost verification should be used for purposes of calculating home marketcredit. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with SKF-UK. The interest rate verifiedduring the cost verification is the best evidence of SKF-UK's short-termborrowing cost. <T3>Comment 25. </T3>Petitioner contends that to calculate U.S. creditdays for the SKF companies for sales with payment outstanding, the Departmentshould use either the longest payment term on those sales where paymentis unsettled or the period between date of sale and the date the last computertapes were received by the Department. SKF-USA submits that its credit expense adjustment was based on actuallending experience for those transactions in which payment was receivedsubsequent to the first SKF-USA submission to the Department. For saleswith payment unsettled, SKF-USA states that it has used the average creditdays outstanding. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department is using the verified average numberof credit days for all AFBs during the POI for purposes of these finaldeterminations. We have accepted the use of an average number of creditdays as a reasonable approximation of credit days outstanding for thosesales where actual payment had not yet been received. <T3>Comment 26. </T3>Petitioner states that the Department should use thelongest payment terms for any U.S. customer as the best information availableto calculate U.S. credit expenses for NTN, since OEMs and other large purchasersin the United States frequently exceed the terms of credit granted to them.The ESP verification report stated that NTN was preparing data on customer-specificcredit, but such data was not yet provided by February 16, 1989 and, inany event, would be untimely if submitted after verification. NTN statesthat customer-specific credit data was submitted at verification and wasalso included on the computer tapes and printouts filed with the Departmenton February 15, 1989.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>The information used to determine U.S. credit expensefor these final determinations was verified and was provided for the recordon February 15, 1989. Where NTN reported actual payment dates, we haveimputed credit based on the period from shipment to payment. Where it wasnot provided, we have used customer-specific information on the averagenumber of days accounts were outstanding as provided by NTN and verifiedby the Department. <T3>Comment 27. </T3>Petitioner contends that NSK's home market interestrates should not be used to calculate U.S. credit costs. Petitioner statesthat the U.S. short-term interest rate must be used for the calculationof these U.S. expenses. Petitioner contends, however, that the U.S. interestrate should not be offset or calculated based on interest income derivedfrom monetary investments, as NSK originally advocated. NSK contends that the Department should use the verified home market short-termborrowing rate to calculate NSK's U.S. credit expenses during the fourmonths of the POI in which no U.S. borrowing occurred. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with petitioner. We have calculated theU.S. interest expense for credit costs using an average of the actual U.S.short-term borrowing rates reported by NSK for the POI, even though NSKdid not borrow in each month of the POI. We have determined that this interestrate is the most representative of the U.S. subsidiary's cost of extendingcredit during the POI. <T3>Comment 28. </T3>Petitioner contends that NTN and NSK did not provideany documentation of a requirement to maintain compensating balances withtheir banks in Japan as a condition of borrowing. Therefore, the Departmentshould disregard compensating balances in the calculation of home marketcredit costs in these final determinations. NTN states that the Department should use the interest rate submitted inits September 6, 1988 response, which includes a cost for compensatingdeposits in calculating NTN's credit expenses. NTN states that the interestrate calculation, prepared in the same manner, was accepted by the Departmentin the final determination of <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished,from Japan </T3>(52 FR 30700, August 17, 1987). <T3>DOC Position. </T3>NSK dropped its claim for an adjustment on compensatingbalances following the preliminary determinations. We agree with petitionerthat NTN was unable to document or otherwise sufficiently demonstrate thatdeposits in its Japanese bank accounts were a requirement for its commercialloans. Consequently, to calculate NTN's home market credit expenses, weused the nominal interest rate consistently charged by NTN's banks, asverified. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 13: Discounts and Rebates </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner makes numerous arguments regarding certainrevisions made by respondents to their responses subsequent to verification.Specifically, with respect to revisions to U.S. price, petitioner contendsthat the Department should: (1) In the absence of conclusive evidence,assume that previously unreported cash discounts and rebates were grantedon all sales by Nachi; (2) deduct an unreported rebate from all U.S. salesby SNR; (3) deduct early payment discounts from U.S. sales which FAG-FRGfailed to report; and (4) deduct from U.S. sales price, rebates and quantitydiscounts which FAG-Italy failed to report. For home market rebates unreportedprior to verification, petitioner urges the Department to reject revisedSNR responses because the revisions were submitted after verification andare therefore untimely. Petitioner also makes the following specific allegations with respect torevisions of rebate and discount adjustments claimed by the respondentcompanies. Petitioner claims that the Department should reject home market rebatesand discounts claimed by NSK because NSK failed to demonstrate that theseexpenses were directly related to sales, and that NSK's revised allocationmethodology which allocates discounts and rebates on a customer-specificbasis was submitted subsequent to verification and, therefore, is untimely.In addition, petitioner contends that the Department should reject forthe purpose of the final determinations those rebates and discounts claimedunder programs which NSK failed to adequately or accurately describe inpre-verification responses.Petitioner contends that ICSA's claimed ``year-end'' rebates in the homemarket should be disallowed because: (1) The 1987 rebates are not reflectiveof the rebates incurred during the period of investigation; (2) the allocationmethodology failed to tie the rebates claimed to specific sales; and (3)the rebates are based, in part, on products outside the scope of the investigation.Similarly, INA-FRG grants rebates at the end of the year based on the amountof purchases a customer makes during the calendar year. Petitioner arguesthat the Department's precedent requires that the respondent (1) demonstratethat accrued but unpaid rebates were actually paid in prior years, and(2) substantiate the level of those rebates. Petitioner claims that SKF-Sweden's allocation methodology resulted inan erroneous calculation of the amount of discounts and rebates claimedon U.S. sales and therefore, the Department should apply the highest discountgranted to a customer to all U.S. sales to that customer. SKF-Sweden claimsthat petitioner misunderstands the manner in which such rebates and discountswere applied to U.S. sales. For home market discounts claimed by FAG-FRG, petitioner contends thatrespondent failed to substantiate that the following were related to salesunder investigation: (1) Early payment discounts, (2) discounts relatedto invoice and pricing errors, (3) compensatory discount credits, and (4)other special discounts. Petitioner also alleges that FAG-FRG implementeda flawed allocation methodology. Petitioner claims the Department shouldeither disallow the discounts claimed or treat the discounts as an offsetto U.S. indirect selling expenses. Respondent maintains that basic discountswere reported on a sales-specific basis and that other discounts were reportedon a customer-specific basis. Petitioner requests that the Department disallow any adjustment to foreignmarket value for cash discounts claimed by GMN because the original informationsubmitted was not sufficiently verifiable in that their method of reportingwas seriously flawed. Petitioner contends that FAG-Italy improperly allocated home market rebatesover sales not under investigation. As such, the Department should nottreat the claimed rebate amounts as direct expenses. FAG-Italy argues thatthe allocation methodology was reasonable and non-distortive, as verifiedby the Department. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department allows revisions to responses afterthe preliminary determination and during verification so long as the revisionsare minor and do not constitute ``new responses,'' <T3>See, Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan,</T3>53 FR 12552 (April 15, 1988). Substantial revisions submitted afterthe preliminary determination are not accepted because insufficient timeexists at that point to analyze and verify the data. Where the Department discovered minor errors during verification on certainrebates and discounts claimed, we verified the correct information andrequested the company to submit a revised response. For information whichwe were unable to verify, the Department disallowed the claimed rebateor discount adjustments. With respect to revisions submitted on U.S. sales,outlined in the first paragraph of comment one for rebates and discounts,the Department will allow the adjustments to U.S. price for Nachi, SNR,FAG-FRG, and FAG-Italy for the following reasons. During verification, Nachi substantiated which customers received the cashdiscounts and rebates, the amount of the discount or rebate given, andthat these discounts and rebates were claimed on a sales-specific basis.Therefore, the Department decided to accept this minor adjustment submittedby Nachi. Petitioner was mistaken in his assertion that SNR's home marketrebate information was untimely. SNR submitted the customer-specific rebateinformation prior to verification and the Department had sufficient timeto analyze and verify the data submitted. The Department also determinedthat the one U.S. rebate which SNR failed to report constitutes a minorrevision. Therefore, we applied the rebate percentage against the transactionsof this customer for the POI, which is consistent with SNR's allocationmethodology. For FAG-Italy and FAG-FRG, the Department will accept theminor revisions and deduct quantity discounts, rebates, and early paymentdiscounts from U.S. sales. With respect to NSK, the Department has accepted only those home marketdiscounts and rebates claimed that NSK accurately and adequately reportedin both the narrative and sales listing portions of the response, and thatwere paid to unrelated customers. All rebates and discounts claimed underinaccurately or inadequately described programs have been rejected. Forthose rebates and discounts accepted, the Department has determined thatNSK's methodology is reasonable in that the discounts and rebates claimedwere allocated on a customer-specific basis. Although the revised allocationswere not presented until verification, because of the relatively minornature of the revision, we have accepted the revised customer-specificallocations. ICSA grants home market rebates at the end of the year, based on the amountof the customer's annual purchases. To report these rebates, ICSA allocatedthe claimed rebate percentages on a customer-specific basis. During verification,the Department found the allocation method employed was reasonable, andconsistently applied. As such, the Department will accept the revised figuresfor the purpose of the final determinations. INA-FRG also grants ``year end'' rebates. During verification, INA-FRGdocumented that their home market year end rebates were granted as a standardbusiness practice, and were granted on a customer-specific basis. The Departmenthas found it reasonable that INA-FRG estimate their rebates based on 1987rebates for that portion of 1988 covered by the POI. We, therefore, willadjust foreign market value for INA-FRG's home market rebates claimed.Regarding the allocation methodology employed by SKF-Sweden, during verification,the Department found that SKF-Sweden's method of reporting U.S. cash discountsand rebates was customer-specific and properly applied to U.S. sales. Therefore,the Department will accept the claimed amounts for the purpose of the finaldeterminations. For FAG-FRG, the Department determined that the discounts were reportedon the same basis as they were granted, and that the allocation methodutilized was consistently applied and reasonable. All discounts were eithergranted on a sales-specific or customer-specific basis. Therefore, theDepartment will deduct the claimed amounts from the appropriate sales forthe purpose of the final determinations. During verification, the Department found that for certain home marketsales transactions, GMN had erroneously reported discounts which had notbeen paid and failed to report other discounts which had been granted.Therefore, for the purpose of the final determination, the Department hasdisallowed an adjustment to foreign market value for the unpaid discountsdiscovered during verification and has allowed an adjustment for all othertransactions where a cash discount was claimed. The Department accepts FAG-Italy's allocation methodology for the purposeof the final determinations. FAG-Italy allocated all rebates on sales eligiblefor rebates over all sales which received rebates. The Department determinedduring verification that the allocation method employed was reasonable,consistent, and accurately reflects rebates incurred on a per sale basis.<T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should disallowFAG-FRG's home market quantity discounts because FAG-FRG failed to demonstratethat: (1) Quantity discounts were granted to at least 20% of such or similarmerchandise sold in the home market; or (2) the discounts are warrantedon the basis of savings which are specifically attributable to the productionof the different quantities involved. Respondent argues that petitioner misunderstands andSection; 353.14 of theDepartment's regulations in that if neither criteria are met, the Departmentwill include the discounted home market sales in calculating the weightedaverage price. Respondent asserts that failure to meet the criteria doesnot enable the Department to deny the claimed discounts.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with respondent. The 20% requirementapplies where the respondent requests a general adjustment for differencesin quantity. The 20% rule is not a prerequisite for deducting discountsactually given on sales. Therefore, the Department will allow the claimeddiscounts and include the discounted sales in calculating the weighted-averageof home market prices. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> Rose Bearing Company, Ltd. argues that under section773(a)(4)(A) of the Act, the Department should allow an adjustment fora quantity discount on a military sale because verification demonstratedthat the discount claimed was a valid quantity discount. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Because the U.S. sale in question was a militarysale that entered the United States under schedule 8 of the TSUSA, thesale is not liable for antidumping duties, and the sale has been excludedfrom the database for the purpose of determining the dumping margins. Therefore,this issue is moot. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department must determinewhether NSK's post-sale home market rebates were customary and in the ordinarycourse of trade or, instead, were made solely to avoid potential antidumpingduty liability. Petitioner also claims that the Department should disregardrebates paid on sales to related parties. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department found no evidence during verificationthat the post-sale adjustments were granted to avoid antidumping duty liability.NSK's response and documentation provided at verification support a conclusionthat the adjustments claimed were customary and in the ordinary courseof trade. Therefore, the Department will allow these rebates for the purposeof the final determinations. Because the Department will not consider NSKsales to related parties in the final determination, the Department neednot address the issue of rebates on related sales. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 14: Selling Expenses </ITAG><T3>Comment 1.</T3> Petitioner contends that RHP's claim for home marketadvertising expenses should not be allowed under 19 CFR 353.15(a) sincethe Department reported that it saw no indication that these expenses weredirected toward the customers of RHP's customer. Petitioner also arguesthat U.S. advertising expenses claimed by RHP should be treated as a directselling expense. Furthermore, petitioner argues that RHP may have doublecounted its home market advertising expense and may be attempting to obtainadjustments for the same expense twice. RHP argues that the Department should treat advertising costs in both marketsas indirect selling expenses in the final determination since RHP reportedthe same types of advertising expenses for both the US and home markets.Respondent further argues that there is no support in the record for Torrington'sspeculative assertion that ``RHP may be attempting to obtain home marketadjustments for the same expense(s) twice.'' <T3>DOC Position.</T3> RHP's home market and U.S. advertising claims arefor indirect selling expenses. The Department established at verificationthat the advertising expenses incurred by RHP were for advertisements notdirected at the customer of RHP's customer. We have therefore treated RHP'sadvertising expenses incurred in the U.S. and home markets as indirectselling expenses for purposes of the final determinations. The Departmentverified RHP's indirect selling expenses, including advertising, and determinedthat RHP has not claimed adjustments for the same expense twice. <T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner contends that SKF-Italy has not justifiedits claim that all U.S. advertising expenses are indirect selling expenses.In particular, SKF-Italy has not submitted samples of actual advertisements.SKF-Italy argues that it has provided a detailed description of all ofits U.S. indirect selling expenses, including advertising, and these amountswere verified. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> SKF-Italy claimed all U.S. advertising expensesas indirect selling expenses. We verified SKF-Italy's U.S. indirect sellingexpenses and found no discrepancies. The purpose of verification is toassess the overall accuracy of the response. This does not imply that theDepartment is required to review each and every charge and adjustment.Because we were able to verify that SKF-Italy's U.S. indirect selling expenseclaim is accurate, we are accepting their claim of advertising as an indirectselling expense. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should not deductadvertising expenses for the printing and publication of catalogues inthe home market as a direct selling expense because SKF-France has notestablished, and the Department has not verified, that these expenses wereincurred by SKF-France on behalf of its customer for sales to the end-userof the merchandise.SKF-France argues that the claimed adjustment for advertising expenseswas based on actual expenses incurred during the period of investigationwhich were directly related to the products under investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The purpose of verification is to assess the overallaccuracy of the response. This does not imply that the Department is requiredto review each and every charge and adjustment at verification. Becausewe were able to verify that the response submitted by SKF-France was generallyaccurate, we have accepted this adjustment as verified and have treatedit as a direct selling expense for purposes of the final determination.However, for sales which are made to OEMs, we are treating such expensesas indirect selling expenses because respondent's catalogues do not promotethe merchandise sold by the OEM. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner states that the Department should deny Nachi'sclaimed adjustment for expenses relating to the distribution of promotionalsamples in the home market because such samples were not a condition ofsale, attributable to the resale of merchandise by the purchaser, nor doesany other evidence exist that a direct relationship exists between thesamples and sales under consideration. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We consider the expense incurred in the distributionof samples to be an appropriate sales promotion expense and we have madethis adjustment. Providing samples to potential customers is a legitimateform of advertising. For expenses incurred in advertising or sales promotionto be considered a direct selling expense, there must be an assumptionby the seller of a purchaser's advertising costs (see 19 CFR 353.15(b)).We find that to be the case in Nachi's claimed sales promotion expense.It is inherently very difficult to tie any form of advertising to a specificsale, and the Department has never made that a requirement before acceptinga claimed advertising expense as an appropriate direct selling expense.Advertising need only be proven to be directed toward the customer's customers.Therefore, expenses incurred in providing samples to dealers and distributorsin the home market have been allowed as direct selling expenses. We havetreated the expenses for samples to OEMs in the home market as indirectselling expenses since the OEM does not sell or advertise the subject merchandise.<T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioner states that the Department should deny Nachi'shome market advertising expenses which allegedly relate to sales to OEMsbecause Nachi failed to demonstrate that expenses for advertisements innewspapers, trade journals and on billboards were directed to the OEM'scustomer. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> In the preliminary determinations, as well as inthese final determinations, we have disallowed advertising expenses onOEM sales that have been claimed as direct expenses. Instead, we have treatedsuch expenses as indirect selling expenses. For advertising to be treatedas a direct expense, it must be assumed on behalf of a respondent's customer;that is, in the instant case, it must be shown to be directed toward Nachi'scustomer's customer. Such advertising was not undertaken or demonstratedto have been undertaken by Nachi on behalf of its OEM customers.<T3>Comment 6. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department should deductfrom U.S. price any expenses incurred with respect to U.S. sales of ICSAmerchandise, whether incurred in Italy, France, or the United States. Inaddition, petitioner argues that a discrepancy in the U.S. advertisingexpense calculation identified at verification in the United States shouldbe corrected in the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have properly deducted all verified indirectselling expenses incurred on sales to the United States. We have revisedthe amount incurred for advertising based on verified information. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Petitioner contends that ICSA's home market advertisingexpenses should be disallowed because it has not been established by respondentwhether these expenses were incurred on the behalf of second-level customersor original purchasers. In addition, petitioner argues that these expensesdo not merit consideration as an indirect selling expense because it isambiguous as to what portion of these expenses are attributable to homemarket or export sales. ICSA contends that the home market advertising and sales efforts of SNRI,SNR's Italian sales subsidiary, are directed at the ultimate consumer ofbearings. ICSA argues that its advertising expenses should be classifiedas direct selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>ICSA presented no convincing evidence that the reportedhome market advertising expenses were incurred on behalf its customer.In addition, we found that advertising cost centers used to calculate advertisingexpenses contained items indirectly related to advertising efforts. Therefore,we are treating these home market advertising expenses as an indirect sellingexpense. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner contends that there should be a correspondingdeduction from SNR's exporter's sales price for any advertising deductionsmade in the home market. Petitioner asserts that it is likely that respondenthas not reported certain home market advertising expenses incurred forU.S. sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have used the data which was reported and verified.We verified the basis of claimed advertising expense adjustments and sawno evidence of unreported advertising expenses. <T3>Comment 9. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department should deductfrom U.S. price any advertising expenses incurred in either France or theUnited States with respect to U.S. sales of SNR merchandise. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We saw no such evidence of unreported advertisingexpenses in either market. We have used verified information for thesefinal determinations. <T3>Comment 10. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department should disallowSNR's home market advertising expenses as direct selling expenses for thefollowing reasons: (1) SNR's claim and demonstration that certain expensesare related to distributors does not automatically make these expensesdirect; (2) the Department could not verify whether these efforts weredirected at end-users or distributors; (3) SNR has admitted that OEM advertisingwas in reality public relation efforts to keep OEM customers informed onthe financial health and the quality control procedures of SNR; (4) reportedhome market advertising expenses are in petitioner's estimation fixed expensessuch as salaries and fees for SNR employees working on advertising andpromotion; and (5) SNR used 1987 expenses as well as products outside thescope of the investigation in its home market allocation methodology. SNR contends that 40 percent of its home market advertising and sales promotionexpenses were directed at the ultimate consumer of bearings. SNR arguesthat these advertising expenses for invitations to trade shows, annualreports, quality brochures and leaflets, angular contact bearing brochures,and press advertisements should be treated as direct selling expenses.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>SNR presented no convincing evidence that the reportedadvertising expenses were incurred on behalf of or directed at the customerof its customer. We found that the claimed OEM advertising efforts werefor public relation efforts designed to educate SNR's OEM customers. Also,quality brochures were used by SNR's quality control department to informits customers, not its customer's customers, on this department's activities.The advertising examples which SNR submitted were institutional in nature.Therefore, we have treated these home market advertising expenses as anindirect selling expense. <T3>Comment 11. </T3>Petitioner contends that FAG-FRG divided its claimedU.S. advertising expenses into direct and indirect portions based on management'sexperience which is unsupported by the record. Accordingly, these claimedexpenses should be treated as direct selling expenses. FAG-FRG contends that it calculated advertising expenses based on management'sbest estimate as to how to subdivide advertising expenses into direct andindirect segments since the company did not maintain records that wouldhave been of assistance to it in this endeavor. FAG-Germany recognizesthat this approach was less than precise but it was the most reasonableunder the circumstances. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, we determined that these expenseswere institutional in nature and not related specifically to the subjectmerchandise. Therefore, for the final determinations, we have treated theseexpenses as an indirect selling expense. <T3>Comment 12. </T3>Petitioner argues that those home market advertisingexpenses claimed by FAG-FRG either were incurred outside the period ofinvestigation, not directly or indirectly related to sales of the subjectmerchandise during the period of investigation, and were not properly allocated.Accordingly, the Department should disallow the claimed expenses as anadjustment to foreign market value. However, should the Department chooseto treat such expenses as part of the home market offset, only those expenseswhich did verify should be included. In the alternative, none of the expensesshould be included as part of the offset. FAG-FRG contends that its claim for a direct selling expense adjustmentto foreign market value for advertising expenses incurred in the home marketshould be allowed in the final determination. In support, FAG-FRG claimsthat the reported expenses were directed toward the home market, employeda nondistortive allocation methodology to separate expenses among bearingand non-bearing products, and justifiably used annual data to capture thecosts of applicable activities over the entire year. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Verification of FAG-FRG's claimed advertising expensesindicated that they were of an institutional nature and not related specificallyto the subject merchandise. Therefore, we have treated these claimed expensesas indirect selling expenses in the final determinations. <T3>Comment 13. </T3>Petitioner claims that FAG-Italy provided no supportfor its segregation of U.S. advertising expenses into direct and indirectexpenses. Consequently, all U.S. advertising expenses should be treatedas direct selling expenses for purposes of the final determination. FAG-Italy argues that it made a reasonable allocation of U.S. advertisingexpenditures between those directed at its customer's customers and thosefocused on its own customers. Accordingly, the claimed expenses shouldbe used in the final determination.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we determined that these FAG-Italy'sexpenses were institutional in nature and not related specifically to thesubject merchandise. Therefore, for the final determinations, we have treatedthese expenses as an indirect selling expense. <T3>Comment 14.</T3> Petitioner asserts that FAG-Italy has failed to establishthat home market advertising expenses are incurred on advertising and salespromotion directed at the second-level customer or end-user of the productother than the original purchaser. Therefore, the Department should rejectthis claim as a direct selling expense in the home market. FAG-Italy asserts that its claim for a direct selling expense adjustmentto foreign market value for advertising expenses should be allowed in thefinal determination since it demonstrated that these expenses were directedto its customers' customers. Further, FAG-Italy asserts that verificationsupports that the claimed expenses were properly claimed and incurred asdirect selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Verification of FAG-Italy's claimed advertisingexpenses indicated that they were of an institutional nature and not relatedspecifically to the subject merchandise. Therefore, we have treated theseclaimed expenses as indirect selling expenses in the final determinations.<T3>Comment 15.</T3> Petitioner contends that the cost of sample bearingsclaimed as a direct selling expense by FAG-Italy should be disallowed notonly because they were shipped in 1987, but also because they lack anydirect relationship to the products under investigation.FAG-Italy argues that the Department's verification report misrepresentedFAG's claim for the cost of sample bearings as a direct selling expenseby stating that these expenses represented ``the cost of <T3>shipping </T3>sample bearings * * * '' (emphasis added). Rather, theclaimed expenses represent the costs of the free sample bearings themselves.Accordingly, which the Department should treat this cost as a direct sellingexpense in its final determination. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have deducted as a direct selling expense thecost to FAG-Italy of providing samples to distributors. The cost of samplesprovided to OEMs has been treated as an indirect selling expense becausethe requirements of 19 CFR 353.15(b) have not been met. The shipping costof these sample bearings was not claimed as part of the expense FAG-Italyreported. <T3>Comment 16.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno direct adjustment to FMV for home market advertising expenses becauseINA-FRG has failed to demonstrate that such expenses are incurred on advertisingdirected at the second-level customer or end-user of the product. Petitionerstates also that it appears that INA's home market expenses may includeexpenses attributable to export sales. Petitioner contends that the Departmentshould allow no indirect adjustment as well. Petitioner points out thatINA had based advertising expense in part upon an unsubstantiated attributionof expenses incurred by INA's technical literature cost center. In addition,total advertising expenses, including expenses incurred with respect toproducts not under investigation, were allocated over INA's total domesticsales, which, petitioner argues, the Department was unable to verify. INA-FRG argues that advertising expenses should be treated as direct expenses.INA-FRG states that its allocation methodology is reasonable and cites<T3>Color Picture Tubes from Japan, </T3>52 FR 44171 (1987). INA-FRG claimsthat its advertising expenses constitute a direct selling expense becausethe expenses were incurred for advertising directed at its customer's customers.Respondent states that the Department verified this and refers to the VerificationReport at pages 11-12. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have treated these advertising expenses as indirectselling expenses. At verification, INA-FRG was unable to demonstrate thatits claimed expenses were incurred on behalf of its customers. We alsoverified that the allocation of these expenses was reasonable. <T3>Comment 17.</T3> Petitioner argues that INA-France's U.S. advertisingexpenses should be deducted as a direct expense because catalogs and pricelists may be provided to respondent's customer to use in reselling themerchandise. Petitioner cites <T3>The Timken Company v. United States, </T3>673 F. Supp. at 510-514.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> INA-USA included the costs incurred for advertisingin the United States in its calculation of indirect selling expenses. Wefound no evidence that INA-USA incurred expenses on advertising directedat the customer's customer. <T3>Comment 18.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno direct adjustment to foreign market value for INA-France advertisingexpenses because respondent was unable to demonstrate that its advertisingwas directed at the second-level customer or end-user of the product. Also,these expenses should not be allowed as an indirect selling expense becauserespondent provided no evidence that they were incurred only for home marketsales, as opposed to export or U.S. sales. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We are treating these advertising expenses as indirectexpenses. INA was unable to demonstrate that its claimed advertising expenseswere incurred on behalf of its customers. At verification, we found thatINA allocated its advertising expenses over total sales (domestic and export)for 1987. Because INA's reported expenses were incurred on all sales, weadded the advertising expense allocation rate in the home market to indirectselling expenses in the U.S. market. INA included the advertising expensesit incurred in the U.S. market in indirect selling expenses. <T3>Comment 19.</T3> Petitioner states that NTN should be denied an adjustmentfor home market advertising expenses because NTN has failed to demonstratethat such expenses were assumed on behalf of NTN's customer. <T3/><T3>DOC Position.</T3> NTN did not claim home market advertising expensesas direct selling expenses. We are treating them as indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 20. </T3>Because NSK's U.S. catalog, submitted as part of itsresponse, indicates that it was ``printed in Japan,'' petitioner contendsthat NSK's Japanese advertising expenses should be allocated over U.S.as well as home market sales. The appropriate amount could then be deductedfrom exporter's sales price. Petitioner makes the same comment for theidentical expenses for NTN and Nachi. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>NSK, NTN and Nachi all reported the cost of printingEnglish language catalogs in their claimed indirect selling expenses forU.S. sales. Properly, such expenses, if incurred on behalf of U.S. distributors,should have been reported as direct selling expenses. However, inasmuchas andSection; 353.23(a) of the Department's regulations allows the Departmentto disregard insignificant adjustments, and we have verified that thoseexpenses are insignificant, we have treated them as indirect selling expensesfor purposes of the final determinations. <T3>Comment 21. </T3>Petitioner maintains that NMB/Pelmec Singapore improperlyclaimed U.S. advertising expenses as indirect selling expenses. BecauseNMB/Pelmec has not provided sufficient information demonstrating that theseexpenses constitute indirect selling expenses, the Department should deductall advertising costs as direct selling expenses from the U.S. price. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We saw no evidence that the advertising expensesclaimed on U.S. sales were incurred on behalf of NMB/Pelmec Singapore'scustomers. We have, therefore, treated these expenses as indirect sellingexpenses. <T3>Comment 22. </T3>Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Thai's advertisingexpenses in the United States consisted of multi-product catalogs, tradejournals, trade shows, and on-site displays and photographs. Such advertisingexpenses are not shown either to be incurred on behalf of NMB/Pelmec-Thailand'sU.S. customers or to be institutional in nature. Therefore, petitionermaintains that there is insufficient data upon which to determine thatsuch costs are indirectly related to the sales under consideration. Assuch, petitioner contends that these expenses should be presumed to bedirect selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We saw no evidence that the advertising expensesclaimed on U.S. sales were incurred on behalf of NMB/Pelmec-Thailand'scustomers. Therefore, we have treated these expenses as indirect sellingexpenses. <T3>Comment 23. </T3>Petitioner contends that Minebea Japan was unableto demonstrate at verification that the reported home market advertisingexpenses were the result of advertising incurred on behalf of its customers.Therefore, the Department should disallow any adjustment for home marketadvertising expenses in the final determination. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Minebea Japan was unable to demonstrate at verificationthat the advertising expenses claimed on home market sales were incurredon behalf of its customers. Therefore, we have treated these expenses asindirect selling expenses. <T3>Comment 24. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department verified MinebeaJapan's advertising expenses in the United States, which consisted of multi-productcatalogs, trade journals, trade shows, and on-site displays and photographs.Such advertising expenses have not been shown either to be incurred onbehalf of Minebea's U.S. customers or to be institutional in nature. Therefore,petitioner maintains that there is insufficient data upon which to determinethat such costs are indirectly related to the sales under consideration.As such, petitioner contends that these expenses should be presumed tobe direct selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We saw no evidence that the advertising expensesclaimed on U.S. sales were incurred on behalf of Minebea Japan's customers.Therefore, we have treated these expenses as indirect selling expenses.<T3>Comment 25. </T3>Petitioner argues that we should not allow any deductionsfor advertising expenses because Rose's advertising is aimed at OEM customersof the company and is not attributable to a later sale of the merchandiseby a purchaser as required under the Department's regulations. Rose agrees that the advertising expenses are aimed at OEM customers butnotes that it does not make sense to aim its advertising at its customer'scustomers in that bearings are often only a very minor part of the finalproduct produced by the OEM. Rose argues that the proper rule to applyin this situation is that if a company can show that its advertising expenseswere incurred in promoting business with its customers, these expensesshould be allowed. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Rose's advertising expenses are for advertisingthat is directed to its OEM customers and not to its customer's customers.Therefore, these expenses are indirect selling expenses. Since we are makingcomparisons to purchase price sales and consider these advertising expensesto be indirect expenses, we have not made any adjustments to home marketprices to reflect these expenses. <T3>Comment 26. </T3>Petitioner asserts that the Department should notinclude any expense for GMN's home market commissions in home market indirectselling expenses since the Department learned at verification that thecommissions GMN reported paying to its Bielefeld office were never actuallypaid. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have not included any expense for related partycommissions in home market indirect selling expenses since we discoveredat verification that GMN did not pay commissions to related parties onsales made through its Bielefeld office. We have included in home marketindirect selling expenses those expenses incurred by GMN in the operationof its Bielefeld sales office. These expenses were added to the offsetfor those home market sales made through the Bielefeld sales office. <T3>Comment 27. </T3>Petitioner claims that FAG-Italy's verification establishedthat the costs of the commissions alleged to have been paid during theperiod of investigation are based on 1987 costs and on the ability of thecommissionaire to meet certain sales goals and objectives. Thus, thereis no fixed relationship between the 1987 data and the commissions paidduring the second half of the period of investigation. The Department shouldnot permit this adjustment for the final determination. FAG-Italy asserts that annual 1987 data are an appropriate basis upon whichto establish the level of commissions applicable to sales in 1988 as commissionsare granted by virtue of the attainment of specified annual sales targets.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>Verification confirmed that FAG-Italy's claimedexpenses for commissions in the home market are based on achievement ofannual sales targets. Therefore, annual data is an appropriate and reasonablebasis upon which to claim commissions. We have allowed FAG-Italy's claimedcommission costs in the final determination. <T3>Comment 28. </T3>Petitioner argues that one of NSK's claimed commissionexpenses in the home market is actually a claim for inland freight andwarehousing expenses in the guise of price adjustments. In this case NSKpays a distributor for transportation and inventory services in connectionwith sales to a home market customer. Petitioner contends that the transportation portion of the expense couldbe an allowable adjustment to foreign market value, but not as a rebate,while the inventory service portion is actually an impermissible claimfor pre-sale warehousing expenses.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have accepted NSK's claim for treating this asa home market direct expense as the verification showed that this expenseis treated and paid as a commission, based on a percentage of the sellingprice. We verified that the distributor does not actually incur movementand warehousing expenses on behalf of NSK, since the commission percentageis fixed by negotiation and is not affected by the actual expenses thedistributor incurs. <T3>Comment 29. </T3>Petitioner alleges that RHP's allocation methodologywith respect to credit notes is inappropriate. Petitioner argues that becausethe home market sales listing was limited on the basis of the Department's33 percent test, the Department should reject the claimed adjustment sincecredit notes were not tied to specific sales, and were allocated acrossall sales. Petitioner believes that because credit notes may affect onlypart numbers that have been excluded from the home market sales listing,credit notes should not reduce all home market prices through an across-the-boardallocation. RHP asserts that its methodology with respect to credit notes issued onhome market sales was developed with the knowledge and assistance of theDepartment as a reasonable means of allocating credit note costs to homemarket transactions and since it has also been thoroughy verified. it shouldbe used in the final determination. Respondent contends that although creditnotes relate to specific sales, RHP could not have completed this laborioustask within the tight time constraints since RHP would have had to revieweach note manually. Respondent claims that petitioner's assertion thatthe ``reasonableness'' of the allocation methodology is somehow affectedby the Department's 33 percent test is unfounded since RHP's home marketsales listing covers thousands of units which constitute a significantportion of the company's total U.K. sales during the six-month review period.Respondent submits that in similar situations, as in <T3>Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan, </T3>53 FR 40,927, 40,930(1988), the Department has accepted reasonable allocation methodologiesdeveloped by respondents. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department has made an adjustment to home marketprice for credit notes issued by RHP on home market sales during the periodunder investigation. The Department reviewed and verified RHP's claimedadjustment for credit notes at verification. The Department has the discretionto determine if a specific adjustment has been appropriately reported bythe respondent. In this situation, we determined that given the substantialquantity of credit notes which were issued on sales during the review period,and the degree of difficulty and the enormous amount of time that wouldhave been involved in tying these credit notes to specific sales, RHP'sallocation of this expense is appropriate and reasonable and has been acceptedfor purposes of our final determination. Furthermore, there was no indicationat verification that credit notes may have been limited to those part numberswhich have not been reported to the Department because of the reportingrequirements in this investigation, nor has petitioner provided any basison which it makes this assertion. <T3>Comment 30. </T3>Petitioner contends that the timing of the identificationof U.S. credit notes, and the significant revision of the computer tapesthis requires, justify the rejection of RHP's U.S. data as unreliable andwarrant that the less than fair value margin for RHP be based upon thehighest margin for any U.K. respondent. Petitioner requests that, at aminimum, a deduction be made in the calculation of ESP for U.S. creditnotes. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department rejects the characterization of RHP'sU.S. data as unreliable and finds, with the exception of minor adjustments,that RHP's U.S. data was accurate. Therefore, the Department has determinedthat despite the late timing of the identification of U.S. credit notes,the Department will use the verified data in its less than fair value analysisof RHP. The Department will, therefore, make an adjustment to U.S. pricefor credit notes issued on U.S. sales by RHP. <T3>Comment 31. </T3>Various respondents state that the Department incorrectlydeducted direct selling expenses from exporter's sales price (ESP), insteadof making an adjustment to foreign market value. NTN, NSK, and RHP cite<T3>Timken Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>673 F. Supp. 495, 511 (CIT 1987) in support oftheir statement. RHP also cites <T3>SCM Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Silver Reed America, Inc., </T3>753 F.2d 1033, 1036-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985).Petitioner asserts that the Department should continue to subtract directselling expenses from ESP since to treat these expenses as a circumstanceof sale and, therefore, add them to the home market price would increasethe base value upon which the percentage margin would be calculated andreduce the margin percentage. Petitioner contends that because the <T3>ad valorem </T3>percentage is thereby reduced, the amount of duty collectedwill be less than that warranted by the actual amount of dumping that occurredin the period of investigation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Deducting these expenses from the U.S. selling priceis consistent with section 772(e) of the Tariff Act which requires theDepartment to reduce ESP for ``expenses generally incurred by or for theaccount of the exporter * * * in selling identical or substantially identicalmerchandise * * *''. Furthermore, Timken has been remanded to the Departmentand is not yet final. The Department will continue to deduct direct sellingexpenses from both the U.S. and home market prices in ESP situations, pendinga final determination of this issue in the courts. <T3>Comment 32. </T3>Petitioner requests that the Department not acceptthe sales values used by RHP as denominators, which have been adjustedfor rebates, in the allocation of expenses incurred by RHP. Petitionerargues that since after-sale rebates are an adjustment for circumstancesof sale, the value of home market sales for purposes of calculating theper unit amount of various adjustments should not be net of rebates. RHP contends that it is completely proper for it to allocate home marketselling expenses on the basis of sales value net of rebates and discounts.Respondent states that it is appropriate for the Department to treat rebatesas a price adjustment rather than as a circumstance of sale adjustmentsince rebates reduce the net prices which customers pay.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department has accepted the sales values usedby RHP as denominators in the allocation of selling expenses incurred byRHP. Rebates are treated by the Department as an adjustment to price andnot as a circumstance of sale adjustment. Therefore, the appropriate salesvalue to use as a denominator is a denominator net of rebates since thatvalue reflects the revenue the company intends to realize from the saleof its merchandise. A denominator net of rebates is an accurate representationof the prices at which the company sold its merchandise. <T3>Comment 33.</T3> Petitioner contends that there is insufficient dataon the record to establish that the alleged RHP indirect selling expenseswere in fact related to sales of the merchandise in the home market. Petitionerrequests that the Department make no adjustment for these expenses. Petitionerrequests that at a minimum, to the extent that an adjustment is made, aportion of the expenses including expenses of the international sales divisionsbe deducted from U.S. price. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department thoroughly verified those amountsclaimed by RHP as indirect selling expenses and established that RHP hadproperly reported and allocated these expenses to both the U.S. and homemarkets. <T3>Comment 34.</T3> Petitioner contends that no adjustment for RHP's indirectselling expenses should be made to foreign market value unless all expensesrelated to export sales are separately identified, allocated, and deductedfrom exporter's sales price. Furthermore, petitioner argues that U.S. indirectselling expenses were improperly commingled with other export selling expensesand allocated over all export sales. Petitioner therefore submits that,for purposes of the final determinations, the calculation of U.S. indirectselling expenses should be corrected by allocating those expenses relatedonly to the U.S. market over U.S. sales. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department thoroughly verified those amountsclaimed by RHP as indirect selling expenses and established that RHP hadproperly reported and allocated these expenses to both the U.S. and homemarkets. RHP reported as part of its U.S. indirect selling expenses indirectselling expenses which were incurred in the home market on behalf of allsales. RHP also reported indirect selling expenses which related specificallyto export sales. These expenses have been separately identified and allocatedover RHP export sales. For its ESP sales, RHP reported that it had alsoincurred indirect selling expenses in the United States on behalf of itsU.S. sales. These sales have been properly identified and allocated overRHP's U.S. sales. Therefore, RHP's U.S. indirect selling expenses werenot improperly commingled with other export selling expenses. <T3>Comment 35.</T3> Petitioner alleges that the Department should allowno adjustment to foreign market value for indirect selling expenses sinceGMN has not shown that all of the components of indirect selling expenseare in fact related to sales. Petitioner submits that some of the variouscomponents of indirect selling expenses appear to be characterizable asgeneral and administrative rather than selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we reviewed the indirect sellingexpense categories reported by GMN. These categories include technicalservices, advertising, Sales Department, Invoice Department, the Bielefeldsales office, and administration expenses. We discovered at verificationthat with respect to each of these categories, with the exception of administration,the expenses which GMN reported were all incurred by cost centers withselling functions. These cost centers contained expenses incurred directlyby the selling function (<T3>e.g., </T3>salaries, gifts, supplies, or advertising), plus other expensessuch as housekeeping or debit interest which were allocated to sales-relateddepartments. Therefore, with the exception of administration expenses,we have allowed these expenses as indirect selling expenses. The administrative expenses which GMN reported as an indirect selling expensewere expenses incurred by GMN and then allocated to a general administrativecost center for each of its production facilities, plus to cost centersfor the data processing office and the Office of Standards. The expenseswhich were allocated to these cost centers included wages and salaries,communications, office-related expenses and supplies. We have determinedfor purposes of our final determination that the administration expensesreported by GMN are not indirect selling expenses since they have not beenincurred by departments with a selling function and have no relation tosales which are made by GMN. <T3>Comment 36.</T3> Petitioner contends that as SKF-Sweden did not providean itemized description of its U.S. indirect selling expenses for partof the period of investigation as per Department's requests and that thesecosts should be deducted from U.S. price as direct selling expenses forthe purposes of the final determination. SKF-Sweden contends that U.S. indirect selling expenses were properly calculatedand that SKF-USA provided a detailed description of its indirect sellingexpenses, including advertising expenses in accordance with the Department'srequest for information. Therefore, SKF-Sweden argues that indirect sellingexpenses have been verified. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> SKF-USA provided an itemized description of itsindirect selling expenses. All expenses included in indirect selling expenseswere examined at verification and found to be related to sales. We have,therefore, made an adjustment for these expenses. <T3>Comment 37.</T3> Petitioner argues that, for SKF-UK, the Departmentshould not allow any deduction from home market price for indirect sellingexpenses. Petitioner contends that SKF-UK failed to link the claimed indirectselling expenses to home market sales. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> While we have allowed an adjustment for certainSKF-UK home market indirect selling expenses, the adjustment was made foronly those expenses that were both explicitly identified as selling expensesand sufficiently linked to home market sales.<T3>Comment 38. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not allowSKF-Sweden's claim for an adjustment to FMV for indirect selling expenses.Petitioner claims that the verification team was only able to trace totalsin the computer tape listings but did not have worksheets which showeda detailed breakdown of indirect selling expenses. Petitioner contendsthat SKF-Sweden has not submitted revised worksheets showing the line itemallocation of these expenses, whether they are even selling expenses, theirrelation to SKF-Sweden's home market sales, and the method used to allocatethem. SKF-Sweden argues that the petitioner erroneously implies that it failedto provide the verification team with worksheets supporting its indirectselling expenses. SKF-Sweden asserts that such worksheets were providedprior to verification, supplemented at verification, and then revised andsubmitted for the record following verification. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We are allowing this adjustment. The percentageamount of indirect selling expenses on the computer tape sales listingmatched the percent supported by the verification exhibits. The verificationteam did trace all line items back to accounting records. <T3>Comment 39. </T3>Petitioner contends that as SKF-France provided noitemized breakdown of Clamart's home market indirect selling expenses,the Department should disallow these expenses for purposes of the finaldetermination as it is far too late in this investigation to provide newand supplemental information.SKF-France claims that its indirect selling expenses were presented tothe Department and verified. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>SKF-France did provide a worksheet showing the itemizedbreakdown of Clamart's indirect selling expenses in its submission to theDepartment dated November 10, 1988. These expenses were verified. However,we have adjusted the indirect selling expenses reported for Clamart's homemarket sales to exclude the expenses incurred by the related distributor,because the related distributor's sales were not included in the home marketdatabase. <T3>Comment 40. </T3>Petitioner submits the Department was unable to verifySKF-France (ADR)'s home market indirect selling expenses because the worksheetspresented at verification did not match the list of expenses provided priorto verification. Therefore, petitioner argues that ADR's home market sellingexpenses were not verified and cannot be used for the purposes of the finaldetermination. SKF-France contends that ADR's indirect selling expenses provided to theDepartment were derived from ADR's standard chart of accounts. SKF-Franceclaims that a calculation and allocation methodology were submitted priorto verification, contrary to the Department's statements in its verificationreport. SKF-France claims that its indirect selling expenses, includingproduct liability expenses, were deemed verified. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Although the Department was able to tie total indirectselling expenses to ADR's financial statements, ADR was unable to documentits proposed allocation methodology. However, after examining other salesdata submitted by ADR, and after considering alternative sources to useas best information available, the Department has decided to use ADR'sreported figures for indirect selling expenses incurred in France on bothU.S. and home market sales as the best information available for purposesof the final determination. <T3>Comment 41. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department should refuseto accept Nachi's revisions to indirect selling expenses because such revisionsconstitute substantial changes which were not completely verified. Petitioneralleges that because a portion of the allocation method was unverifiable(<T3>i.e., </T3>historical cost allocation data was not available), andtherefore unreliable, the Department should refuse to accept the revisedtape. Petitioner states that if the Department accepts the revised figuresfor indirect selling expenses, the Department should ensure that indirectselling expenses are not improperly allocated to sales to trading companies,and that expenses attributable to tapered roller bearings are excludedfrom the subject sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In preparation for verification, Nachi officialsdiscovered that they had underreported the indirect selling expenses attributableto ESP sales. They corrected the error before the beginning of verificationand the Department was able to verify the revised indirect selling expenses.We have, therefore, used the revised, and verified, expenses in this finaldetermination. We also determined that the allocation of the expenses tothe subject merchandise was reasonable. Furthermore, these expenses werenot allocated to purchase price sales made to Japanese trading companies,nor were the expenses allocated over sales of tapered roller bearings.<T3>Comment 42. </T3>With respect to ICSA's home market indirect sellingexpenses incurred by SNRI in Italy, petitioner contends that the Departmentdid not verify whether the items included were related to Italian salesor to export sales. In addition, petitioner argues that many of the itemsmay have been double counted or may not be related to the sales of products.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have accepted the claimed indirect selling expensesin our final determinations. At verification, we saw no evidence that suchexpenses were incurred on export sales, that expenses were double counted,or that they were not related to sales of the products under investigation.<T3>Comment 43. </T3>Petitioner contends that SNR has claimed salariesfor home market advertising, technical services, and quality control asboth indirect and direct selling expenses. Petitioner claims that the Departmentshould limit any deduction for indirect selling expenses to ensure thatthere is no double counting.  <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified that there were no instances of doublecounting. <T3>Comment 44. </T3>Petitioner asserts the following regarding SNR's U.S.indirect selling expenses: (1) Indirect selling expenses incurred in Franceare understated by the exclusion of related items such as professionalservices, office expenses, travel and entertainment, employee benefits,rent, etc.; (2) percentages for indirect selling expenses should be appliedto the U.S. gross unit price instead of the entry value of the subjectmerchandise; and (3) warehouse maintenance expenses should be based onvalue rather than weight. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We intend to use the data reported and verified.We saw nothing at verification indicating that respondent understated indirectselling expenses incurred in France. SNR's indirect selling expense factorswere applied to U.S. gross price and warehouse maintenance expenses wereallocated on the basis of weight. Weight is more closely correlated withsize than is value and size is what determines warehouse space requirementsand maintenance costs. <T3>Comment 45. </T3>Petitioner asserts that FAG-FRG provided neither ameaningful, detailed breakdown by function or category nor worksheets showingallocation methodology of indirect selling expenses prior to verification.Further verification demonstrated that certain expenses were either incorrectlyincluded in or improperly allocated to this pool of expenses. Accordingly,FAG-FRG's claim for indirect selling expenses should be disallowed as adeduction from foreign market value in the final determination.FAG-FRG states that they established at verification the accuracy of theunderlying data and the reasonableness of the methodology employed in thereporting of indirect selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we examined the indirect sellingexpenses claimed by FAG-FRG by function and category according to its costcenter classification codes. Verification confirmed that FAG-FRG employeda reasonable allocation methodology. Hence, we will allow FAG-FRG's claimedexpenses in our final determination. <T3>Comment 46.</T3> Petitioner argues that having failed to produce itemized,substantiated data for home market indirect selling expenses incurred duringthe period of investigation, FAG-Italy has failed to prove it is entitledto this adjustment for purposes of the final determination. FAG-Italy contends that its alleged failure to provide an itemized breakdownof claimed home market indirect selling expenses which were disallowedfor the preliminary determination was remedied at verification. FAG-Italyargues further that the use of costs based on calendar year 1987 reflectsall normal year-end adjustments and accruals. Moreover, these costs arelinked to the products under investigation as FAG-Italy is engaged in thebusiness of producing and selling bearings. Accordingly, the Departmentshould now allow these expenses for the final determination. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with FAG-Italy. At verification, we examinedindirect selling expenses claimed by FAG Italy according to its cost centerclassification codes. Verification confirmed that FAG-Italy employed areasonable allocation methodology. Hence, we have allowed FAG-Italy's claimedexpenses in our final determination. <T3>Comment 47.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno adjustment to FMV for indirect selling expenses because at verification,much of the information provided by INA-FRG was found to be unsupported.For instance, petitioner points out the INA was unable to divide the costsof the General Sales Department between domestic and export sales. INA-FRGbelieved that most of the expenses were incurred for domestic sales, soit allocated all of the Department's costs to domestic sales. The samewas done for expenses attributable to the salary of the president of thesales division. Petitioner asserts that INA-FRG was unable to substantiateits allocation of the costs of the Logistics Department to indirect homemarket selling expenses. In addition, petitioner argues that the SocialCost Center does not perform a sales function at all and that its expensesare actually general expenses or those pertaining to administration. Respondent argues that the Department should utilize the claimed home marketselling expenses for purposes of the final determination. Respondent statesthat it provided a specific breakdown of these expenses and that the Departmentfound no discrepancies with it at verification. Respondent cites <T3>Portable Electric Typewriters from Japan, </T3>48 FR 40,761, 40,766,(September 9, 1983), and <T3>Television Receiving Sets, Monochrome and Color from Japan, </T3>46FR 30163, 30166, (June 5, 1987). <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have disallowed INA-FRG's claim for the socialcost center expense because we found that the expenses were of an administrativenature and, therefore, not selling expenses. We have disallowed a portionof the cost of the logistics department because respondent was unable tosubstantiate the allocation. Also, we have added to INA-FRG's claimed indirectselling expenses the cost of the regional sales engineers, which we deniedas part of technical service expenses. <T3>Comment 48.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should treatINA-FRG's non-U.S. selling expenses as direct and deduct them from U.S.price. Petitioner cites <T3>Silver Reed America Inc. </T3>v.<T3> United States, </T3>603 F. Supp. 1393 (1988) as precedent for allowingexpenses incurred in the home market to be treated as direct selling expenses.Petitioner also cites <T3>The Timken Company </T3>v.<T3> United States, </T3>673 F. Supp. 495 513-14 (1989) as precedent fortreating these as direct expenses when adjusting U.S. price. INA-FRG argues that non-U.S. indirect selling expenses should not be deductedfrom U.S. price or, alternatively, should be considered indirect sellingexpenses. Respondent objects to the inclusion of these expenses on thegrounds that there is no statutory basis for deducting them because theseare general expenses of the parent company incurred in the FRG. Respondentcites <T3>Forklift Trucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR 12552, 12563) as a case wherethe Department concluded that the general expenses of a parent incurredoutside the United States do not constitute indirect selling expenses.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We treated selling expenses incurred outside ofthe United States for U.S. sales as indirect expenses. INA-FRG has an exportteam which handles the export markets in the Western Hemisphere. The costsof this export team can be tied to sales made to the United States. Therefore,we are deducting these expenses from U.S. price. <T3>Comment 49.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should not allowINA-France's claimed adjustment for home market indirect selling expensesbecause they cannot be tied to the product or the period under investigation.Petitioner explains that INA-France calculated its allocation rate by dividingtotal indirect costs by total 1987 turnover. Total costs included costsfor all sales, domestic and export. INA-France argues that the Department should accept those indirect sellingexpense adjustments which were rejected for purposes of the preliminarydetermination, as the Department has since verified them. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We did not allow this adjustment for the preliminarydetermination because respondent had not provided an adequate breakdownof the claimed expenses. However, prior to verification, INA-France didsubmit a breakdown. We reviewed the supporting documentation at verificationand found no discrepancies. Therefore, we are accepting INA-France's 1987-basedallocation for indirect selling expenses as best information available.<T3>Comment 50. </T3>Petitioner states that it appears that expenses associatedwith NTN's sales in the United States, including technical services, advertising,and export administration expenses, may have been incurred in Japan forthe benefit of NTN's related U.S. importer, in which case these amountsmust be deducted from exporter's sales price under 19 U.S.C. 1677(e)(2).At a minimum, petitioner argues that the amount of headquarters generaland administrative expenses allocated to U.S. sales must be deducted fromexporter's sales price. Petitioner also argues that the expenses of the``International Trade Headquarters'' in Japan should be allocated to U.S.sales in proportion with the ratio of U.S. sales to total export sales.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>NTN provided, and we have deducted, indirect sellingexpenses incurred in Japan attributable to U.S. sales. These include expensesfor ``International Trade Headquarters'' personnel and other associatedindirect selling expenses. <T3>Comment 51. </T3>Petitioner states that, given NTN's control over theinformation necessary for the response and NTN's failure to remedy priorinsufficient responses, the Department should presume that U.S. sellingexpenses are direct unless proven otherwise, citing <T3>Timken </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>673 F. Supp. 495 (1987). Further, to the extentthat technical services and other services are stated in the sales contract,such expenses are directly related to U.S. sales and are not eligible forinclusion in the exporter's sales price offset cap. NTN states that it has answered every question posed by the Departmentin its questionnaires or at verification regarding the nature of its sellingexpenses. It further states that there is no basis on which the Departmentmay now say that there are insufficient facts on which to determine whichexpenses are direct and which are indirect. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified NTN's selling expenses and have treatedthem as direct or indirect selling expenses based on the information onthe record. We also verified that the technical service expenses reportedfor ESP sales were solely payroll expenses. Therefore, we have treatedthese expenses as an indirect selling expense. <T3>Comment 52. </T3>Petitioner states that NSK's U.S. indirect sellingexpenses which were not verified, should be classified as direct sellingexpenses. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified NSK's reported expenses and found thatthey are properly classified as indirect selling expenses. <T3>Comment 53. </T3>Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec-Singapore's U.S.selling expenses have been misallocated, understated and improperly classifiedas indirect selling expenses. This has understated exporter's sales priceor inflated the offset amount. Petitioner maintains that in the absenceof evidence to the contrary, all U.S. selling expenses should be viewedas directly related selling expenses. Furthermore, petitioner contendsthat it is inappropriate for the Department to utilize the new informationregarding U.S. indirect selling expenses obtained during verification forpurposes of the final determination, as it should have been included inthe questionnaire response. In addition, petitioner maintains that indirectselling expenses incurred in Japan on U.S. sales are understated. In particular,petitioner contends that the personnel-related expenses incurred by Keiaisha,the Minebea-related company which handles all documentation for Minebea'simports and exports, were improperly excluded from the reported U.S. indirectselling expenses incurred in Japan. Petitioner also contends that Minebealikely markets bearings from any of its worldwide plants and assists insales force training and other selling activities. Such expenses are likelyto be included in third country indirect selling expenses; therefore, anallocable share of total indirect selling expenses incurred in Japan, regardlessof the alleged market to which such expenses relate, should be deductedfrom U.S. price. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In response to petitioner's argument that no newinformation should be used, the Department maintains that the data fromNMB/Pelmec-Singapore's original response has been used because the Departmentverified that NMB/Pelmec-Singapore's expense allocation methodology wasreasonable. Regarding petitioner's comment that the personnel-related expensesincurred by Keiaisha should be deducted from U.S. price, the Departmentmaintains that the total amount of these expenses was so small as to havean insignificant effect on U.S. price (see, 19 CFR 353.23(a)). <T3>Comment 54. </T3>Petitioner argues that NMB/Pelmec-Singapore has notsufficiently demonstrated that the claimed third country indirect sellingexpenses have been incurred and that the reported selling expenses havebeen correctly apportioned to the merchandise under investigation. Furthermore,petitioner argues that respondent has not demonstrated that the indirectselling expenses have not been double-counted under other types of expenses.According to petitioner, an adjustment pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) shouldnot be made to the extent that expenses cannot be attributed to sales inJapan. Expenses which cannot be identified with a particular market shouldbe deducted from all sales worldwide on a <T3>pro rata </T3>basis. The amount deducted should be limited to actualselling expenses.NMB/Pelmec-Singapore maintains that indirect selling expenses incurredin Japan by the Karuizawa Division are properly allocable to third countrysales of ball bearings. Furthermore, respondent states that it did notimproperly claim certain expenses as indirect selling expenses, nor didit double-count selling expenses or report selling expenses specificallytied to Japan-made bearings as indirect selling expenses on Singapore-madebearings. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We verified that the claimed indirect selling expenseswere allocated properly. Certain indirect selling expenses are recordedin the accounts of the Karuizawa Division and are attributable to salesof ball bearings (domestic and imported). However, it was not possibleto tie the specific indirect selling expenses to the bearings producedin each market. We verified that NMB/Pelmec-Singapore's indirect sellingexpenses incurred on third country sales of ball bearings could not beidentified according to the specific country of origin of the ball bearing,but that its allocation methodology was reasonable in the absence of actualexpense figures. Indirect selling expenses consisted of expenses directlyattributable to sales of ball bearings and shared product line expenses(<T3>i.e., </T3>allocable to all products). Furthermore, we verified thatexpenses which had been claimed as direct selling expenses were not double-counted,as they were deducted from the indirect selling expenses calculation thatwas reported and verified. <T3>Comment 55.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department verified thatMinebea Thailand (a related OEM) sells products for NMB/Pelmec and MinebeaThailand, but did not verify whether Minebea Thailand incurred sellingexpenses with respect to export sales to the United States, Singapore,Japan, or elsewhere. Petitioner further contends that the indirect sellingexpenses claimed by NMB/Pelmec Thai were calculated on the basis of homemarket sales only, but that NMB/Pelmec did not demonstrate that these sellingexpenses were related only to home market sales and unrelated to exportsales. Accordingly, petitioner contends that either no deduction shouldbe made for these expenses, or the indirect selling expenses should beallocated over total sales and a <T3>pro rata </T3>portion deducted from the U.S. price. NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that the Department reviewed Minebea Thai's export-relatedselling expenses and determined that the response fairly reflected thecompany's actual experience. Therefore, petitioner's contention that thehome market indirect selling expense claim is somehow tainted by the failureto verify Minebea Thailand's export-related expenses is unsupported bythe facts. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Because we have determined that the Thai home marketwas not viable, we have based foreign market value on constructed value,as best information available. Therefore, the issue of home market sellingexpenses need not be addressed. With respect to NMB/Pelmec Thai's U.S.sales, we deducted the indirect selling expenses incurred by both MinebeaThailand and NMB/Pelmec Thai. <T3>Comment 56.</T3> Petitioner contends that the SKF-USA ``other expenses''were erroneously added to, instead of deducted from, U.S. price by theDepartment in its preliminary determinations. Petitioner contends thatsuch expenses should be deducted from the U.S. price in absence of a fullexplanation from SKF-USA. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Expenses which SKF-USA claimed as ``other expenses''are, in fact, corrections for data entry errors. In the preliminary determinations,we added these expenses to U.S. price since their purpose was to correctboth understatements (when the value was positive) and overstatements (whenthe value was negative) to the reported prices. Therefore, we have treatedthese ``expenses'' in the same manner for purposes of these final determinations.<T3>Comment 57.</T3> Petitioner alleges that given that RHP's product liabilityinsurance policy applies anywhere in the world, the policy costs must beallocated over worldwide sales rather than the home market sales denominatorused by RHP. Petitioner states that it is irrelevant that the expense wasincurred in the United Kingdom and requests that the Department disallowthis adjustment. RHP contends that, contrary to the assertion of the petitioner, the expensefor product liability insurance was allocated over total RHP sales. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> RHP has reported, and the Department has verified,an expense for a product liability insurance policy which applies to allsales made by RHP worldwide. This expense was properly allocated by RHPon the basis of worldwide sales. Contrary to petitioner's allegation, theproduct liability expense allocated by RHP on the basis of home marketsales was for actual product liability expenses incurred on home marketsales by RHP during the review period. The Department has used RHP's expensefactors for purposes of the final determinations. <T3>Comment 58.</T3> Petitioner asserts that product liability expensesare a fixed overhead expense rather than a selling expense, and that SKF-Francefailed to demonstrate that the premiums paid during the period of investigationrelated to coverage for products sold during this period. Petitioner claimsthat for these reasons, this adjustment to FMV should be disallowed inthe final determination. In addition, petitioner states that the Departmentdid not verify this claim.SKF-France claims that its indirect selling expenses, including productliability expenses, were deemed verified.  <T3>DOC Position.</T3> It is Department practice to treat product liabilitypremiums as indirect selling expenses. <T3>See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Internal-Combustion,Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan </T3>(53 FR 12552, April 15, 1988).Furthermore, the purpose of verification is to assess the overall accuracyof the response. This does not imply that the Department is required toreview each and every charge and adjustment at verification. Because wewere able to verify that the response submitted by SKF-France was generallyaccurate, we have accepted this adjustment as verified and have treatedit as an indirect selling expense for purposes of the final determination.<T3>Comment 59.</T3> Petitioner contends that ICSA's home market productliability insurance premiums, inadvertently included in indirect sellingexpenses, should be disallowed because they are a fixed expense ratherthan a selling expense. In support, petitioner cites <T3>Tubes for Tires, other than Bicycle Tires, from the Republic of Korea</T3>(49 FR 26780 (June 29, 1984)). Alternatively, if the Department doesnot disallow product liability premiums, petitioner argues that the Departmentshould deduct the amount of product liability premiums which were improperlyincluded in the inland insurance amount. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We intend to allow product liability insurance premiumsas part of home market indirect selling expenses. We will also reduce inlandinsurance by the amount of product liability premiums inadvertently includedtherein.<T3>Comment 60.</T3> Petitioner argues that FAG-FRG's product liabilityexpenses should be disallowed because they are actually fixed overheadexpenses, not selling expenses. In addition, it allocated these expensesonly to home market sales, when they are at best related to worldwide sales.Therefore, if it does not deny this adjustment, the Department should atleast deduct it, in equal amounts, from home market and export sales. FAG-FRG contends that the product liability factors are based on policiesin force during the period of investigation and are applicable to bearingsales in the home market. Accordingly, the Department should accept FAG-FRG'sclaim for product liability insurance premiums as direct home market sellingexpenses for the purposes of the final determination. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> It is Department practice to treat product liabilitypremiums as indirect selling expenses. <T3>See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Internal-Combustion,Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan</T3> (53 FR 12552, April 15, 1988).Furthermore, verification established that product liability factors employedby FAG-FRG were based on policies in force during the period of investigationand were applicable to bearing sales in the home market. Therefore, wehave treated these claimed expenses as indirect selling expenses for purposesof the final determination. <T3>Comment 61.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno adjustment for product liability expenses incurred by INA-France becauseit included premiums which cannot be tied to the sales under review. Petitioneralso points out that respondent's expenses were based on 1987 experience.Petitioner contends that expenses related to the payment of insurance premiumsare in the nature of fixed overhead expenses and should not be deductedfrom FMV. Petitioner argues that respondent never explained whether itsinsurance contract was exclusively related to home market sales. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> It is Department practice to treat product liabilitypremiums as indirect selling expenses. <T3>See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Internal-Combustion,Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan</T3> (53 FR 12552, April 15, 1988).We have, therefore, treated these expenses as an indirect selling expense.Furthermore, we disagree with petitioner that product liability premiumscannot be tied to the sales under investigation since INA-France pays productliability premiums on a sales value basis. We reviewed the insurance policyand found no discrepancies in the information INA-France had reported asits premium. The product liability expense INA-France reported was notan allocated expense but a fixed premium percentage which INA-France incurson a per sale basis in the home market. <T3>Comment 62.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should deductan allocable portion of New Hampshire Ball Bearings' product liabilityexpenses from NMB/Pelmec Thai's U.S. price. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we found that the product liabilityexpenses reported in the response by NMB/Pelmec-Thai, and incurred by NHBB,covered a full year rather than the six-month period under investigation.We have, therefore, recalculated the per unit product liability expenseincurred by NHBB and deducted the appropriate amount from the U.S. price.<T3>Comment 63.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should deductproduct liability expenses from the U.S. price reported by Minebea Japan.Minebea Japan maintains that product liability expenses were accuratelyreported in the response. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we discovered an error in respondent'scalculation of the per unit product liability expense, because the premiumamount reported covered the full year rather than the six-month reviewperiod. We have recalculated the per unit product liability expense anddeducted the correct amount from the U.S. price. <T3>Comment 64.</T3> Petitioner contends that SNR's reported home marketquality control expenses cannot be directly related to any sales becausethey are primarily salaries. Petitioner further argues that the allocationof these expenses is based on 1987 expenses and on products outside thescope of the investigation. SNR contends that home market quality control and inspection expenses forOEM sales should be treated as direct selling expenses since there is continuedinteraction between the quality control department and OEM customers andsince the department randomly inspects bearings sold to OEMs. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We found that home market quality control and inspectionmeasures provided to OEM customers were of a routine nature and would havebeen incurred whether or not a particular sale had been made. In addition,these reported expenses were primarily for salaries. For these reasons,we are treating quality control and inspection expenses as an indirectselling expense. <T3>Comment 65.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno adjustment to FMV for quality control expense because, although INA-FRGadmitted that such expenses are incurred on specific sales, these saleshave not been identified. In addition, INA-FRG allocated these expensesover total domestic sales, which, according to petitioner, the Departmentwas unable to verify. INA-FRG argues that quality control expense should be treated as directexpenses and deducted from FMV. Respondent explains that it has agreedwith certain customers to conduct self-certification programs which requiredetailed monitoring and recording, in addition to the standard qualitycontrol operations which are part of the production process. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We are treating these expenses as indirect expenses.INA-FRG claimed it incurred these costs through agreements with certaincustomers to provide post-production quality control. However, INA-FRGallocated these costs to all sales, not just to those customers who receivethis extra quality control.<T3>Comment 66. </T3>Petitioner argues that despite RHP's statement thatPrecision Division's technical expenses do not include Randamp;D costs incurredby RHP's Bearings Research Center (BRC), Appendix 8 to its October 20,1988 submission shows that there are charges from the BRC for the SalesEngineering and Automotive groups. Petitioner also argues that the deductionfor technical service expenses for Automotive Engineering should not beallowed since it may not be applicable to the bearings under consideration.Furthermore, petitioner states that since these services are identifiedwithin a separate cost center, divorced from the sales function, they shouldnot be treated as an offset to home market sales because they are not sellingexpenses incurred with respect to bearing sales. RHP contends that, contrary to the assertion of the petitioner, RHP doesnot maintain records that would enable it to tie the expenditures for technicalservices to individual sales. Respondent argues that all technical serviceexpenses incurred by the technical service staff in the UK for such activitiesas applications advice, new product concepts, after-sale service, and generalresearch were properly allocated over worldwide sales and the same <T3>ad valorem </T3>percentage was applied to home market, purchase price,and ESP transactions. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department has included in the technical serviceadjustment those expenses which were incurred by the sales engineeringand automotive engineering cost centers, since the Department verifiedthat each of these departments has a sales-related function with respectto all sales made by RHP. As these departments have no production function,we have adjusted for all expenses RHP has claimed for these cost centers.The expenses incurred by the Bearing Research Center, which have not beencross charged to a cost center with a sales function, were not reportedor claimed by RHP as part of its technical service expense. RHP reported,and the Department verified, that the Industrial Division's sales engineeringand automotive engineering departments incurred the Bearing Research Centercharges during the period under investigation. The Department also verified the Precision Division Bearing Research Centercharges during the review period. These charges however, relate to productswhich were not sold in the United States during the review period and notreported in the home market sales listing. Therefore, these expenses werenot included in the technical services expense allocation. <T3>Comment 67. </T3>Petitioner contends that SKF-Sweden has failed tosubstantiate the costs related to technical services in the home marketand these costs should, therefore, not be treated as indirect selling expenses.Petitioner states, at a minimum, these costs should be allocated to allSKF-Sweden sales and a share deducted from U.S. price as well as home marketprice. Petitioner also contends that new data provided at verificationfor third country technical services was unverifiable and, therefore, nodeduction should be permitted. SKF-Sweden contends that the comments made by petitioner are based on informationprovided during the SKF-FRG verification and are unrelated to technicalservices expenses for SKF-Sweden's third country sales adjustments. SKFstates that petitioner's arguments are, therefore, inappropriate. Further,SKF-Sweden asserts that it properly included its technical services asindirect selling expenses, which was proven at the SKF-Sweden sales verification.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>SKF-Sweden claimed no adjustment for either director indirect technical service expenses in the home market. At verification,we found no evidence that SKF-Sweden incurs any technical service expenses.Therefore, petitioner's argument has no basis. <T3>Comment 68. </T3>Petitioner contends that SKF-Italy's original responseincluded only direct expenses for technical services incurred for U.S.sales, such as travel. Absent evidence that all technical service expensesincurred for U.S. sales are indirect expenses, the Department should treatthem as directly related to these sales. Petitioner alao asserts that SKF-Swedenand SKF-Italy probably incur some technical service expenses with respectto U.S. sales. A prorated share of such expenses, whether or not includedin home market adjustments, should be deducted from U.S. price. If theDepartment does not have sufficient information to do this, it should basethe deduction on the experience of another respondent.SKF-Italy claims that it does not incur direct expenses for technical serviceson U.S. sales and contends that the Department has verified that technicalservice expenses are properly treated as indirect selling expenses. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The purpose of verification is to assess the overallaccuracy of the response. This does not imply that the Department is requiredto review each and every charge and adjustment at verification. Becausewe were able to verify that the response submitted by SKF-USA was generallyaccurate, we have accepted this adjustment as verified and have treatedit as an indirect selling expense for purposes of the final determination.<T3>Comment 69. </T3>Petitioner contends that all U.S. technical serviceexpenses should be treated as direct expenses because SKF-Sweden failedto demonstrate otherwise and should be deducted from U.S. price for thepurposes of the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The purpose of verification is to assess the overallaccuracy of the response. This does not imply that the Department is requiredto review each and every charge and adjustment at verification. Becausewe were able to verify that the response submitted by SKF-USA was generallyaccurate, we have accepted this adjustment as verified and have treatedthe claimed expense as an indirect selling expense for purposes of thefinal determination. <T3>Comment 70. </T3>Petitioner submits that SKF-France never providedany information showing that the technical services provided were calledfor as part of the purchase agreement or were other than good will or salesefforts. Therefore, the Department should continue to treat such expensesas indirect selling expenses. SKF-France claims that it demonstrated that technical services were directin nature. SKF-France asserts that technical services expenses includethose services which help a customer identify purchases for a particularproduct or ensure that equipment is properly installed and operating. SKF-Francecontends that travel expenses for engineers travelling to the project siteis an example of an allowable technical service expense. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification we found that the home market technicalservices reported by SKF-France were directly related to SKF-France's homemarket sales and that the technical service expenses claimed were separatefrom good will and sales efforts. Therefore, we have treated them as adirect selling expense. <T3>Comment 71. </T3>Petitioner contends that because the Department failedto examine Nachi's testing expenses in the U.S. market, the Departmentmust assume that the expense was incurred on all sales. The Departmentshould, therefore, treat expenses relating to testing as direct expensesand deduct the appropriate amount from all U.S. sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with the petitioner. We did examineNachi's technical service expenses on U.S. sales. (<T3>See, </T3>sales verification report of Nachi-Fujikoshi Corporationdated December 19, 1988 and the ESP verification report of Nachi Americadated February 14, 1989.) We have treated the testing expenses incurredon selected U.S. sales as direct selling expenses. We also verified thatno other direct technical service expenses were incurred on U.S. sales.<T3>Comment 72.</T3> Petitioner states that the Department should denyNachi's claimed adjustment for technical service expenses which are personnel-relatedand are not directly related to home market sales. They further state thatnon-personnel related technical service expenses such as testing expensesare not incurred pursuant to a contract and are intended merely to bolsterNachi's reputation. Therefore, they should be characterized as an indirectselling expense. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> Nachi was able to tie specific testing expensesto specific sales made to specific customers. These services were providedat the request of the customer because it wanted to test the products'applicability to functions other than the specific purpose for which itwas purchased, or because the customer suspected that there was somethingwrong with the bearing. Included in the claimed testing expenses were toolingexpenses and personnel expenses. We have segregated that portion of theclaimed expenses which pertain to personnel expenses, and have treatedthat portion as an indirect selling expense. Personnel expenses are treatedas indirect selling expenses because they are non-variable; that is, theyare incurred by a company regardless of whether or not a specific salehad been made. However, we considered the tooling expenses incurred inthe testing of specific bearings to be an appropriate technical serviceclaim and have treated that portion of Nachi's claim as a direct sellingexpense. <T3>Comment 73.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department failed toverify whether there is more than one SNR-US employee providing technicalservices. Since technical services expenses in France are greater thantheir claimed counterparts in the United States, petitioner argues thatthe Department should assume that a portion of these home market technicalservices expenses are allocable to U.S. sales of ICSA/SNR merchandise.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We verified U.S. technical services expenses andfound no basis upon which to allocate home market expenses to U.S. sales.We also segregated technical service expenses by travel, salary, and relatedfringe benefits. We treated travel expenses as a direct selling expense,and salary and fringe benefits as an indirect selling expense. <T3>Comment 74.</T3> Petitioner contends that ICSA's home market technicalservices expenses should be disallowed because they are based on salariesand are not representative of the period of investigation. In addition,petitioner argues that these expenses do not merit consideration as anindirect selling expense because ICSA did not indicate as to what portionsof the two engineers' time is attributable to home market or export sales.ICSA contends that technical service expenses should be treated as directselling expenses because these expenses were incurred on specific bearingsales. In addition, citing <T3>Rhone Poulenc S.A. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>6 ITRD 1001 (CIT 1984) and <T3>Smith Corona Group v. United States, </T3>713 F. 2d 1568, 1580 (Fed.Cir. 1983), ICSA argues that each technical service expense claimed neednot be attributed to a particular sale in order to qualify as a directselling expense. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We found that technical services provided to customerswere of a routine nature and would have been incurred whether or not aparticular sale had been made. In addition, these expenses were primarilyfor salaries and not tied to sales. For these reasons, we are treatingtechnical service expenses as an indirect selling expense. As discussedelsewhere, we have accepted use of 1987 data as best information available.<T3>Comment 75.</T3> Citing the Department's questionnaire and <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished fromJapan, 52 FR 30704, </T3>petitioner argues that SNR has failed to directlyrelate home market technical service expenses to the subject merchandiseand that the Department should therefore continue to treat as indirectselling expenses all technical services in the home market. In particular,petitioner argues that the reported technical service expenses cannot bedirectly related to any sales because they are primarily salaries whichare fixed expenses, and because there is no contract. Moreover, petitionercontends that research and development costs do not qualify as technicalservice expenses. Finally, petitioner argues that SNR's allocation methodologyuses 1987 expenses and products outside the scope of the investigationand that certain cost centers included in calculating home market technicalservice expenses did not verify. SNR contends that technical service expenses should be treated as directselling expenses because these expenses were incurred on specific bearingsales. In addition, citing <T3>Rhone Poulenc S.A. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>6 ITRD 1001 (CIT 1984) and <T3>Smith Corona Group </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>713 F. 2d 1568, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1983), SNR arguesthat each technical services expense claimed need not be attributed toa particular sale in order to qualify as a direct selling expense. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> SNR's reported technical service expenses were primarilyfor salaries, but included the cost of manufacturing prototypes on behalfof potential customers. Because we no have evidence that these expenseswere conditioned on sale, we have treated these expenses as an indirectselling expense. As discussed elsewhere, we have accepted use of 1987 dataas best information available. We have also determined that SNR's technicalservice expenses were allocated in the only manner its company books andrecords would allow. We have, therefore, determined that SNR's allocationmethodology was reasonable. <T3>Comment 76.</T3> Petitioner argues that FAG-FRG did not demonstratethat its technical service expenses were directly related to the salesunder investigation, as opposed to non-comparison sales or sales outsidethe period of investigation. In addition, petitioner contends that theDepartment did not verify that post-sale technical assistance expenseswere anything more than ``goodwill'' gestures. For this reason, the Departmentshould not consider any of FAG-FRG's technical service expenses a directselling expense. Instead, they should be treated as part of the home marketoffset to U.S. indirect selling expenses.FAG-FRG contends that its claim for technical services was based on variablepre- and post-sale expenses which were tied to the products under investigation.Furthermore, FAG-FRG rejects petitioner's argument that the provision ofthe claimed expenses be part of a purchase agreement or were other thangood will or promotional efforts. Accordingly, the Department should grantthis adjustment in the final determination. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, we determined that FAG-FRG's claimedtechnical service expenses were of a routine nature that would have beenincurred regardless of whether any particular sale had been made. Accordingly,we have treated all of FAG-FRG's claimed technical services expenses asindirect selling expenses for purposes of the final determinations. <T3>Comment 77. </T3>Petitioner asserts that verification of FAG-Italyestablished that some of the expenses claimed for technical services includedconsultant fees, automobile rentals, association dues, and travel expensesfor pre- or post-sale assistance. Since there is no evidence that technicalservices are provided as a result of a sales agreement and not merely forgoodwill or maintenance of customer loyalties, the Department should notallow this claim for purposes of its final determination. FAG-Italy argues that its claimed technical service expenses relate tovariable expenses incurred in the home market on behalf of products andsales under investigation. This fact alone is sufficient to allow the amountof the claimed adjustment. The technical service need not be provided pursuantto a purchase agreement. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, we determined that FAG-Italy'sclaimed technical service expenses were of a routine nature that wouldhave been incurred regardless of whether any particular sale had been made.Accordingly, we have treated all of FAG-Italy's claimed technical servicesexpenses as indirect selling expenses for purposes of the final determinations.<T3>Comment 78. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno adjustment to FMV for technical services, either as a direct or an indirectexpense because INA-FRG has not demonstrated how pre-sale services canbe directly linked to specific sales during the POI. Moreover, petitionercontends that INA-FRG has not shown that its customers were entitled totechnical services as part of the terms of sale. Also, a portion of theexpense itself was based on what petitioner claims is an unsubstantiatedestimate of time spent by the sales engineers on technical services. Inaddition, petitioner states that total technical service expenses includedexpenses incurred for products not under investigation. Finally, totaltechnical service expenses were allocated over INA-FRG's total domesticsales which petitioner argues, the Department was unable to verify. INA-FRG argues that technical service expenses should be treated as directexpenses. Respondent claims that its technical service expenses are out-of-pocketexpenses directly tied to the specific sales in question. INA-FRG claimsthat those technical service expenses incurred by the sales engineers thatit did not claim as direct technical service expenses are the type of expensesthe Department usually treats as indirect expenses. INA-FRG further arguesthat these expenses are direct expenses in that the sale of products hingeson INA-FRG's ability to provide technical services to a customer. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We are treating the expenses incurred for technicalservices as indirect expenses. The vast majority of the technical serviceexpenses incurred by INA-FRG were salaries. These costs were allocatedacross all sales, even though respondent claimed they could be tied tospecific ones. Also, we are disallowing the cost for the regional salesengineers (RSE's). INA-FRG was unable to substantiate its allocation ofthe RSE's costs to technical services. INA-FRG stated at verification thatthis was simply an estimate of the amount of time the RSE's spend performingtechnical services. <T3>Comment 79. </T3>Petitioner argues that, with respect to INA-France,technical services should be deducted, including technical expenses incurredby the parent on behalf of the U.S. subsidiary. Petitioner contends that,according to the verification report, technical service expenses incurredin the home market are equally applicable to U.S. sales. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree. Total technical service expenses claimedon U.S. sales by INA-France equaled the percentage claimed on home marketsales. These expenses were allocated by INA-France over all sales. Theseexpenses have been treated as an indirect selling expense in each market.<T3>Comment 80. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno adjustment for INA-France's technical service expenses in the home marketciting <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings from Japan </T3>(52 FR at 30,709), as an instanceof when the Department did not permit an adjustment for technical services.The verification team could find no indication that ESP sales did not alsobenefit from these technical services. Petitioner asserts that the reportedexpenses are not even indirectly related to sales of the subject merchandisemade during the period of investigation because INA-France used expensesfor all of l987 in order to determine the per unit technical service expenses.Moreover, petitioner argues that INA-France's inclusion of costs incurredby sales engineers is unwarranted since the sales engineers do not performtechnical services. Finally, petitioner states that the verification teamfound no evidence of contractual obligations to provide technical assistance.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>Contrary to petitioner's allegation, the Departmenthas verified that INA-France did not include the costs incurred by thesales engineers in the allocation of technical service expenses. However,INA-France did include the costs incurred by its studies-application andtesting station departments as a direct technical service expense. Sincethese costs could not be related to individual sales, and since the Departmentcould not verify that INA-France had contracted to provide technical assistance,we are treating technical service expenses as an indirect selling expensefor purposes of the final determinations. As discussed elsewhere, we haveaccepted use of 1987 data as best information available. <T3>Comment 81. </T3>Petitioner states that NTN has failed to demonstratea direct relationship between technical services in the home market andsales during the period of investigation. Petitioner further states thatif the Department grants an adjustment for technical services, employeesalaries should be excluded. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>NTN did not claim technical services as a directexpense in the home market. We are treating these expenses as indirectselling expenses in our final determinations. <T3>Comment 82. </T3>Petitioner states that the Department should denyin full an adjustment for warehousing expenses in those instances whereNachi cannot document that the expenses were incurred as a condition ofsale and, that although a tacit agreement existed between Nachi and theOEM that Nachi was to make ``just in time delivery'', no actual contractexisted. Nachi states that in order to insure that delivery is made promptly tocertain important customers, they have arranged to store bearings in warehouseslocated near these customers. When the customer requests shipment of thebearings, the warehousing company delivers them to the customer. Nachialso states that the warehousing expense is included in the sales pricecharged to the customer and that the customers are specified in the contractnegotiated between Nachi and the warehousing company. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For these home market sales, Nachi states that thedate of shipment from the warehouse to the customer is the date of sale.Nachi argues that warehousing expenses which are directly related to andincurred solely on behalf of a certain customer, whether or not incurredbefore or after the sale, should be allowed as an adjustment and cites<T3>Atlantic Steel Co. </T3>v. <T3>United States. </T3>Nachi has incorrectly cited that case. In <T3>Atlantic Steel, </T3>the court ruled that the Department properly madea deduction for <T3>post-sale </T3>warehousing expenses in the home market. Since Nachihas claimed that the date of shipment is the date of sale, the warehousingin question can only be of a pre-sale nature. Therefore, we are treatingit as an indirect selling expense. At verification we found that this expenseincluded freight to customer, storage, and packing, but these expensesare not broken out in the contract between Nachi and the warehouse company.Since the expense cannot be broken out, we are treating the whole expenseas an indirect selling expense for the reason specified above. <T3>Comment 83. </T3>Petitioner states that NTN's home market warehousingexpenses do not constitute a permissible adjustment because the date ofsale is the date of shipment in the home market. Therefore, an adjustmentshould be granted for such expenses only if the expenses were incurredpursuant to specific contractual terms.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> Using NTN's definition of its date of sale, theseexpenses are thus pre-sale warehousing and have been treated as an indirectselling expense. <T3>Comment 84.</T3> Petitioner claims that because SKF-USA refused todisclose its warranty experience for the past five years, the Departmentshould use best information available for adjusting U.S. price for theSKF companies. Petitioner proposes that the highest warranty expense incurredby any other respondent should be used as the best information available.SKF-France contends that U.S. warranty expenses incurred during the periodof investigation were submitted to the Department and are deemed verified.<T3>DOC Response.</T3> In response to our request for warranty experienceby class or kind of the subject merchandise for the previous five years,SKF-USA informed us that such information would be misleading because SKF-USA'sproduct classifications and corporate organization have changed drasticallyover this time period. At verification, documentation of SKF-USA's productclassification and corporate organization confirmed this explanation. Furthermore,because we were able to verify that the response submitted by SKF-USA wasgenerally accurate, we have accepted this adjustment as verified and havetreated it as a direct selling expense for purposes of the final determination.<T3>Comment 85.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should applythe highest warranty expense of any respondent against Nachi's U.S. salesas the best information available because Nachi failed to provide dataon warranty expenses in their original questionnaire response and subsequentresponses to deficiency letters. Furthermore, petitioner argues that useof the best information available is warranted because the Department didnot examine any warranty data during verification. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department did verify Nachi's warranty expenseswith respect to U.S. sales (see, the sales verification report of Nachi-FujikoshiCorp. dated December 19, 1988, p. 19-20). The warranty claims which werepaid on ESP sales were paid on non-comparison merchandise, and thus arenot reflected on the revised ESP sales tape. There were warranty expensespaid on matched purchase price sales, and those expenses have been usedin this final determination. Because the expenses were paid on sales ofonly one product, we instructed Nachi not to submit a revised purchaseprice sales tape, since it is easier, and less expensive, for the Departmentto input manually the revised warranty expenses. <T3>Comment 86.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should usethe warranty figure originally reported by FAG-FRG and not its revisedfigure. FAG-FRG contends that petitioner's analysis of FAG-USA's warranty expensesis flawed due to petitioner's failure to include sales of products producedby FAG-USA and resales of merchandise purchased by FAG-USA from others.Accordingly, the Department  should reject petitioner's analysis and acceptthe warranty factor verified by the Department in its final determination.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, FAG-FRG informed the Department'sverification team that in order to account for discrepancies in its previousquestionnaire responses, it had revised the factor used to allocate U.S.warranty expenses. Because the revised allocation factor did not representa significant change in methodology and had a minimal effect on the allocationfactor, it was verified, and used for our final determinations. <T3>Comment 87.</T3> Petitioner submits that FAG-FRG failed to submit evidencethat its home market warranty costs represented repair costs under warrantyas opposed to costs related to service calls or repairs under separate,non-warranty service contracts. Furthermore, petitioner recommends thatsince FAG-FRG incurred no home market warranty expenses for aerospace bearings,this factor should only be applied to bearings which have no aerospaceapplications. Therefore, petitioner proposes that the Department shouldeither reject FAG-FRG's claim entirely or at a minimum use the home marketwarranty expenses factor which was corrected to exclude aerospace bearings.FAG-FRG asserts that since the credibility and accuracy of its claimedwarranty expenses were confirmed at verification, the Department shouldgrant this adjustment to foreign market value. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have verified that FAG-FRG's claimed warrantyexpenses did not include expenses incurred as a result of separate servicecontracts. We have also verified that no warranty expenses were incurredon aerospace bearings. Therefore, for our final determinations, we haveused the revised allocation factor which excludes sales of aerospace bearings.<T3>Comment 88.</T3> Petitioner claims that FAG-Italy's claimed warrantyexpenses on home market sales should be considered indirect selling expensesfor the purposes of the final determination since such expenses could notbe broken down into fixed and variable portions nor among the differentclasses or kinds of merchandise. FAG-Italy asserts that its warranty expenses relate only to variable homemarket expenses which bear a direct relationship to sales under investigation.Moreover, FAG-Italy points out that its use of 1987 calendar year datadoes not diminish its relevance to sales under investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, we determined that FAG-Italy'shome market claimed warranty expenses were based on variable costs only.Although FAG Italy's warranty records were not kept on a class or kindbasis, it used a reasonable allocation methodology to allocate home marketwarranty costs to the products under investigation. FAG-Italy allocatedwarranty expenses in the only manner its company books and records wouldallow. In the final determination, we have treated these claimed expensesas a direct selling expense. <T3>Comment 89.</T3> Petitioner submits that because the historical warrantyexpense figure is a more accurate estimate of FAG USA's warranty expensesduring the period of investigation, it should be used for purposes of thefinal determination with respect to FAG-Italy. FAG-Italy maintains that its U.S. warranty expenses are entirely consistentwith historical experience and should be used for the purposes of the finaldetermination. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with FAG-Italy that its U.S. warranty expensesare consistent with historical experience. We have used this expense forpurposes of these final determinations. <T3>Comment 90.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should allowno adjustment to FMV for warranty expenses as INA-FRG did not differentiatebetween fixed and variable warranty expense. Petitioner points out thatINA-FRG calculated warranty expenses in part by estimating the percentageof the cost of three cost centers allocable to warranties, and that INAdid not provide any documentation to substantiate this estimate. In addition,warranty expense included products not subject to the investigation. INA-FRG argues that the Department should treat warranty expenses as directexpenses and deduct them from FMV. INA-FRG asserts that these expensesare direct because they consist of credit notes and direct payments tocustomers for problems with the quality of purchased merchandise. Respondentcites <T3>Certain Internal Combustion Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan,</T3>(53 FR 12552, 12562, April 15, 1988). Respondent claims these expensesare direct, even though the expenses were allocated across all sales.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disallowed a portion of INA-FRG's reported homemarket warranty expenses (related to receiving and quality control, thechemical and material laboratory, and the precision measuring department)because INA-FRG was unable to explain the allocation of these expenses.We treated the remainder of INA-FRG's reported warranty expense as an indirectselling expense. These expenses included credit notes for direct paymentsto customers, but also included the salaries of the personnel who covercustomer complaints. <T3>Comment 91.</T3> Petitioner argues that we should treat the U.S. warrantyexpenses for NMB/Pelmec Singapore, NMB/Pelmec Thailand, and Minebea Japanas direct selling expenses. Petitioner states that these respondents havefailed to demonstrate that the warranty expenses are indirect in nature.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We verified that all the warranty expenses claimedon U.S. sales consisted only of salaries and related fringe benefits. Therefore,consistent with our normal practice, we have treated them as indirect sellingexpenses as they are incurred whether or not a sale is made. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 15: Difference in Merchandise </ITAG><T3>Comment 1.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should disallowMinebea Japan's difference in merchandise adjustments claimed for identicalmodels. Minebea Japan maintains that adjustments for differences in physical characteristicsshould be allowed for identical merchandise because the Department verifiedthe differences in fabrication costs for these models. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> No adjustment has been made to account for allegeddifferences in fabrication costs associated with sales of identical merchandisebecause we verified that, based on weighted average production costs, therewere no cost differences. We make adjustments for differences in merchandiseonly when there are physical differences in the merchandise. <T3>See, </T3>19 CFR 353.16. Therefore, only for those instances wherewe have compared similar products, have we made adjustments for the differencesin physical characteristics, based on verified cost information. <T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should mergeSKF-UK's home market ``comparison'' and ``non-comparison'' sales filesto compare with the U.S. sales file for purposes of the LTFV calculations.Petitioner bases its argument on the fact that SKF-UK identified identicaland non-identical products by using part numbers, instead of the five matchingcriteria outlined by the Department. Petitioner contends that this invalidatesthe product matching used by SKF-UK because the part numbers include muchmore information than just the five matching criteria. SKF-UK argues that the model matches it reported are correct because allof the Department's matching criteria were included. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with SKF-UK. On the basis of verification,we are satisfied that the model matches reported by SKF-UK are for productsthat are identical in all physical characteristics. The matching criteriareferred to by petitioner were contained in our instructions to respondentsfor selecting <T3>similar </T3>merchandise. Given that all comparisons for SKF-UK are<T3>identical, </T3>these criteria do not apply. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> Petitioner maintains that NMB/Pelmec Singapore failedto match equivalent ISO and ABEC precision ratings and to report precisionratings for a large number of third country sales transactions. As a result,the Department was unable to determine with certainty that all possibleidentical matches were reported. Therefore, petitioner maintains that theDepartment should resort to the use of best information available. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> At verification, NMB/Pelmec Singapore explainedthat it did not consider products with different precision rating standardsto be identical because the tolerance standards of the ABEC and ISO classificationsystems are not exactly identical. Based on information obtained throughour own research, we have learned that the ABEC dimensional tolerancesfor ball bearings were to be changed to correspond to the ISO standardsas of October 28, 1987. We also learned that, even prior to October 1987,the differences between the ABEC and ISO standards were minor. However,we have no information on the record to determine whether NMB/Pelmec Singaporehas reset its production machinery so as to eliminate any differences,however minor, between the ABEC and ISO standards. Therefore, as best informationavailable, we have accepted NMB/Pelmec Singapore's contention that theABEC and ISO ratings are not exactly identical. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner contends that for the spherical plain bearingsreported, Minebea Japan used incorrect product comparison criteria in selectingthe most similar bearings. Because Minebea Japan used the width of theball rather than the width of the race, petitioner contends that the Departmentshould reject Minebea Japan's response and use best information availablefor the final determination. Minebea Japan maintains that it correctly measured the width of the bearingin determining model matches. Given that the questionnaire gave no guidelineson how width should be measured, Minebea Japan argues that it reasonablyassumed the maximum width of the assembled merchandise to be the appropriatemeasurement. Furthermore, it maintains that the use of ball width or racewidth would not lead to fundamentally different results. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with Minebea Japan. The questionnaire issuedin this investigation did not specify whether the width of the ball orthe width of the race should be reported for spherical plain bearings.We examined Minebea Japan's product catalog and found that both ball widthand race width are included in the product description for spherical plainbearings. In addition, because respondent was consistent in its approachby reporting the width of the ball for both home market and U.S. sales,we have no reason to believe that the use of ball width as a product matchingcriteria would fundamentally alter the results. Furthermore, petitionerprovided no information to demonstrate that the reporting of race widthis a more appropriate measurement than ball width, nor has it demonstratedthat the use of ball width as a matching criteria leads to distortive results.<T3>Comment 5. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that foreign marketvalue should be based on the submitted data, which is complete and verified.Any mistakes made in the original model matching methodology were minorand were corrected at verification. The impact of any error in model matchingis negligible and can be corrected on the database examined at verificationif the Department chooses to do so.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department has based its calculation of foreignmarket value on verified third country data. Prior to verification, onNovember 4, 1988, NMB/Pelmec Singapore submitted a revised computer tapethat corrected errors on the original third country database submitted.The November 4th tape had a minor error in the concordance. Therefore,on November 21, 1988, NMB/Pelmec Singapore submitted another revised computertape, the second to be submitted after the preliminary determination. TheNovember 21st tape was submitted prior to verification but too late tobe used on verification. However, by comparing the two tapes, the Departmentwas able to determine that the November 21st tape represents the verifieddata and was submitted in time to be analyzed and used for purposes ofthe final determination.<T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner maintains that, with respect to sphericalplain bearings, in order to determine which bearings were identical, MinebeaJapan relied on the part numbers of the bearings. Because the bearing partnumbers are different depending on whether the bearing is designated byinch or metric measurement, bearings that were identical except for a fractionaldifference in the outer and inner diameter (due to the metric versus inchmeasurement) were not reported as identical merchandise. Petitioner contendsthat by doing this, Minebea Japan did not provide a reliable database ofcomparison sales. That is, if a given bearing is identical, it is automaticallyreported and becomes part of the comparison database used to determinethe ultimate dumping margin. If, however, the bearing is similar, it isused as a comparison sale only if it is in a bearing group that makes upthe top 33 percent of U.S. sales by volume. Therefore, petitioner contendsthat because Minebea Japan did not provide a reliable database of identicalsales, the Department should use best information available, which it contendsshould be the rate found for Minebea Japan in the preliminary determinationfor plain bearings. Minebea Japan maintains that metric-size and inch-size bearings are notidentical according to the Department's criteria. Since Minebea Japan soldno metric-size spherical plain bearings in the home market that were identicalto inch-size bearings sold in the United States, no such matches were reported.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with Minebea Japan. In accordance withour revised reporting requirements issued on August 8, 1988, Minebea Japanreported home market sales of products identical to U.S. products onlyif such products were identical in all respects. Because the bearings soldin the home market are designated by metric measurement while bearingssold to the United States are designated by inch measurement, Minebea Japanconverted the measurements and only considered products to be identicalif the measurements were the same when carrying out the calculation tofour decimal places. Furthermore, during verification, we examined allsales of merchandise reported as similar to U.S. products and found thatall of the similar products had different physical characteristics otherthan metric vs. inch measurement. Therefore, we verified that all identicalmatches were accurately reported. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Petitioner asserts that NSK's sales listing is flawedin numerous respects and must therefore either be corrected or be rejected.To identify identical comparisons, NSK used its 20-digit product codes,which may have created improper matches due to the fact that identifiersfor such physical aspects as grease or clearance, which are not includedin the five product-matching criteria established by the Department, maybe included in these codes. NSK also used as comparison characteristicsthose part numbers that include customer-specific prefixes and double asterisksuffixes. The prefixes are etched or ``impressed'' into the bearing, whilethe double asterisk indicates that the clearance or precision rating is<T3>not </T3>impressed into the bearing. Petitioner also cites a specificexample of NSK's failure to compare identical merchandise, which was foundat ESP verification. NSK claims that it properly reported its identical U.S. and home marketproducts, contending that those bearings which differ in terms of etchingare not identical. Such bearings are not physically identical and the costof producing an etched bearing is higher due to the additional step inthe production process. It also contends that it appropriately did nottreat bearings with different clearances as ``identical'', since bearingswith different clearances are not interchangeable, have different end uses,and are clearly not identical. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In accordance with our revised reporting requirementsissued on August 8, 1988, NSK reported home market sales of products identicalto U.S. products only if such products were identical in all respects,including with respect to clearance and grease. Petitioner is correct,however, in its contention that the etching of customer-specific prefixesand clearance ratings, or the lack thereof, is immaterial to the identificationof identical merchandise comparisons. NSK was unable to demonstrate thatdifferences in etching were anything other than cosmetic. These bearingsare otherwise physically identical and interchangeable with each other.We have applied a rate based on best information available for these productswhich NSK excluded from comparisons because of these differences in etching.We also agree with petitioner with respect to bearings found at ESP verificationto be erroneously excluded from comparison because of a part number matchingerror. A BIA rate has been applied to that quantity of bearings. <T3>See, </T3>Final Determinations: AFBs from Japan, and the Best InformationAvailable section of this Appendix B for a description of the BIA rate.<T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner contends that NTN incorrectly selected identicalbearings by including in its selection criteria other than those specifiedin the preliminary determinations. These ``extra'' criteria included codesin the bearing part numbers for type of grease, clearance (the distancebetween the rollers and the top of the outer race), and contact angle.Petitioner states that there is generally no cost difference between mosttypes of grease, so grease should not have been used in the selection ofidentical bearings. Similarly, different clearances and contact anglesshould not have been used in selecting identical bearings. Petitioner furtherstates that codes for clearance, grease, and contact angle may have beenomitted from the part numbers which were used for matching and thereforethe entire computer program matching ``identicals'' is flawed. Petitionerargues that the Department should correct NTN's product comparisons orreject the response.NTN claims that its use of bearing part numbers to identify identical merchandisecorrectly identified bearings that were the same in all respects. NTN furtherstates that it followed the Department's criteria in selecting similarmerchandise.In addition, FAG-FRG maintains that the Department is allowing Japaneserespondents to match identical merchandise <T3>without </T3>taking into account the clearance and grease, whereasthe Department is requiring that FAG-FRG include these two factors in identifyingidentical merchandise. FAG-FRG claims that this apparent inconsistencyin the Department's matching guidelines puts it at a disadvantage vis-a-visthe respondents in the Japanese investigations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>With regard to NTN, we verified that merchandisereported as identical in both markets was identical in every respect. Furthermore,the petitioner has confused the Department's criteria for identical merchandisecomparisons with those for ``most similar'' comparisons. The matching criteriaset forth in the questionnaire set parameters for selecting similar merchandiseand were not meant to constitute all of the physical characteristics requiredto determine whether any two bearings are identical. With respect to FAG-FRG's comment, the Department has been consistent inits guidelines regarding identical matches. The respondents in the Japaneseinvestigations <T3>did </T3>consider clearance and grease, as manifested in bearing partnumbers, in identifying identical merchandise. <T3>Comment 9. </T3>NTN states that, because of the Department's instructionsas to model matches, all bearings in the same family were considered tobe similar. As such, many bearings were identified as ``most similar'',even though in some instances the costs were quite different, while inothers the cost of the home market bearing was the same as that of theU.S. product. NTN states that the most similar bearing, and that whichshould be used in comparison to the U.S. bearing, is that which has thesame cost as the U.S. bearing. Petitioner states that 19 U.S.C. 1677(16) makes no provision for the considerationof cost in matching such or similar products. It further states that, evenif the costs are identical, this fact does not eliminate the possible needfor an adjustment where there are physical differences between the twoproducts that necessitate such an adjustment on the basis of the cost differencesattributable to those physical differences. Thus, although the total costsmay be similar, the cost associated with specific physical differencesmust be the basis for an adjustment. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree that even if costs are identical, thisdoes not necessarily eliminate the possible need for an adjustment wherethere are physical differences between the two products. <T3>See, </T3>19 CFR 353.16. Therefore, to calculate foreign market value,we used a weighted-average of all products that were considered to be ``mostsimilar'' using the criteria in our questionnaire for selecting similarproduct comparisons.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 16: Issues Related to Cost of Production Investigation </ITAG>This section addresses the comments pertaining to the cost of production(COP) and constructed value (CV) for the products of the following companiesfor which a sales-below-cost investigation was initiated by the Department.We have not included comments related to those products of SKF-FRG, SKF-Swedenand SKF-Italy where the Department used ``best information available''because the cost of production (COP) and constructed value (CV) data werenot used for the Department's final determination.

For the CV, in accordance with the Department's policy as set forth inthe <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: All-Terrain Vehiclesfrom Japan, </T3>imputed credit and inventory carrying costs were includedas selling expenses. The portion of interest expense reflected in the companies'books for these activities was deducted in order to avoid double counting.In all cases, the actual general expenses of the company exceeded the 10percent statutory minimum requirement so that no adjustment to generalexpenses was required. This section of the Appendix is organized into two subsections. Subsection(a) deals with general comments relating to all companies, a ``Europe''section which includes comments that pertain to two or more European companies,and an ``Asia'' section which includes comments that pertain to two ormore Asian companies. Subsection (b), which addresses company-specificcomments, is arranged alphabetically first by country, then by companyname. (a) General Comments<T3>Comment 1.</T3> Petitioner claims that, for determining the COP andCV, one of the major issues to be decided in these cases is whether thetransfer prices for components obtained from related companies are ``priceswhich fairly reflect the value in the market under consideration.'' Petitionerargues that the transfer prices should be used for the COP and CV and mustbe: (1) Equal to arm's-length prices; and (2) above the COP. For each specificcompany, based on the facts related to that company, petitioner advocatesdifferent resolutions. For FAG-FRG and FAG-Italy, petitioner contends that ``best informationavailable'' should be used for transfer prices because the prices submittedby FAG did not meet the above criteria and were arbitrary. FAG-FRG claims that the amount of parts it received from a related companyduring the POI was so small that any adjustment would have a <T3>de minimis </T3>impact on the cost of the final product. FAG-Italy argues that its methodology, using the actual costs for the componentsfrom related companies for the COP calculations, is consistent with theDepartment's methodology, and that actual costs should also be used forCV calculations. FAG also asserts that its transfer prices for componentsare not arbitrarily determined and that they conform to Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. Furthermore, FAGemphasizes that actual market prices may be below the COP because marketforces could cause prices to be depressed for significant periods of time.For NMB/Pelmec Singapore and NMB/Pelmec Thai, petitioner states that forcomponents received from Minebea Japan, the costs should be used sincethe transfer prices were below costs. Petitioner argues, however, that``best information available'' should be used for other transfer priceswhich could not be determined to be arm's-length transactions.NMB/Pelmec Singapore and NMB/Pelmec Thai argue that the transfer pricesshould be used because the quantity for those components received fromrelated companies where the transfer prices were below their actual costsis so small that any adjustment would have a <T3>de minimis</T3> effect. For Nachi, petitioner claims that the methodology used for COP and CV calculationsby the respondent, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the actual costs for the components transferred betweenrelated companies, was incorrect because it did not provide transfer information.Additionally, petitioner states there is no evidence that these were actualcosts or that the related companies were consolidated by Nachi in the ordinarycourse of business. Nachi argues that neither the law nor the Department's regulations addressthe issues of consolidating related suppliers for calculating COP. However,they state that the longstanding practice in this regard is clear; theDepartment uses the costs of components from related companies. Althoughthey point out that the degree of ownership necessary for the Departmentto consolidate the transactions may have varied, the Department indicatedas early as 1984 that it could not be bound by section 773(e)(2) for thisdecision in its COP cases. Nachi stresses that the Department cannot ignore its own longstanding policyestablished in <T3>Lightweight Polyester Filament Fabric from Japan,</T3> 49 FR 472 (1984),(that actual costs are used when ownership is 20 percent or more) and,if the Department does vary from such a practice, then it must follow the requirements of the questionnaire,<T3> i.e.,</T3> 50 percent direct and/or indirect ownership. To supportthe use of the actual cost, Nachi also contends that since these companiesoperate as a single entity, the use of actual costs for components whichare transferred is economically rational. For NTN and NSK, petitioner notes that, for the transfer prices from relatedcontractors/suppliers used for the COP and for the CV calculations, oneof NTN's related subcontractors transferred parts at prices which wereless than the full COP and charged NTN lower prices than were charged tounrelated companies. Petitioner asserts that, to the extent that both NTN and NSK failed todocument the reasonableness of the transfer prices paid, the Departmentshould utilize ``best information available'' to determine the value ofspecific components. NTN and NSK advocate the use of the transfer prices included in their submission.NTN notes that parts were transferred at prices less than the costs ofthe related contractor for only four of nineteen parts examined at verification.The majority of the parts reviewed were transferred to NTN above the costsof the related company. NTN also notes that lower prices charged to NTNby the related subcontractor than charged to an unrelated firm for similarprocessing occurred only once in the numerous transactions with varioussubcontractors examined during verification. Both NTN and NSK maintainthat the related contractors examined by the Department at verificationoperated at reasonable profits and that substantially all of their businesswas with their respective related companies. Accordingly, the Departmentshould accept the transfer prices paid to these related suppliers/subcontractorsas a fair approximation of market value. For SKF-France, Italy and U.K., petitioner advocates using the full costof components transferred within the SKF Group companies if the transferprices are below the costs. However, petitioner also alleges that to relysolely on the actual COP instead of transfer prices may not account forthe profit which may be earned on arm's-length sales. SKF claims that the responses for COP and CV calculations include the actualCOP for components obtained from related companies and that these costswere verified. Therefore, the response for SKF-France, Italy, and U.K.should be used for the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department followed its policy of using actualcosts instead of transfer prices of components received from related companiesfor the COP calculations when there was more than a 50 percent direct and/orindirect ownership between the companies. This 50 percent test was outlinedin the questionnaire and is consistent with ``generally accepted accountingprinciples'' regarding the degree of ownership required to consolidatetransactions between related companies. When this degree of ownership exists,the transactions of these companies are consolidated and the costs of theproducts sold to third parties are recorded at the actual costs withoutintercompany profit/loss that might be included in  the transfer pricesused between the companies. For CV, pursuant to section 773(e)(2) of the Act, the Department uses transferprices between related companies unless such prices do not ``fairly reflectthe value in the market under consideration''. Here we have reason to believethat transfer prices do not reflect market prices. In this industry, themarket for bearing components is virtually nonexistent. The lack of independentcomponent suppliers indicates that the component market does not yielda reasonable return. The Department had no evidence of profitable marketsales of components nor any reason to believe that under the current circumstancesthe market prices for components would have been above the cost of production.Additionally, the Department was unable to test transfer prices to marketprices because the industry was characterized by: (a) Nationally and multinationallyintegrated producers; (b) one or few producers in each country; and (c)thousands of different products of varying size, grade and specificationsrequiring exacting components. Consequently, the market for bearing components was virtually nonexistentand credible, market prices could not be obtained. Prices for identicalcomponents from unrelated companies in the appropriate market existed inonly very rare instances. Additionally, the Department encountered little,if any, sourcing of components from independent component suppliers. Therefore,lacking arm's-length prices for components to compare to transfer prices,for CV purposes, the Department generally used the cost of the componentsas representative of the value reflected in the market under consideration.For SKF-France, Italy and U.K., FAG-Italy and Nachi, the Department usedthe full cost of the components transferred between related companies forthe COP and for the CV calculations. For FAG-FRG, transfer prices were used for the COP and the CV calculationsbecause the quantity of components purchased from related suppliers wasso small that an adjustment to these prices to actual costs would havehad a <T3>de minimis </T3>effect on costs. For NMB/Pelmec Singapore and NMB/Pelmec Thai, transfer prices were usedfor the COP and the CV calculations because: (1) The parent company purchasedballs from unrelated suppliers and the transfer prices of the balls receivedfrom the parent company equalled costs, <T3>i.e., </T3>the price paid by the parent plus handling costs; and (2)the quantity of inner and outer rims supplied by related companies thatwere used for production was so small that an adjustment would have hada <T3>de minimis </T3>impact on costs. For NTN and NSK, transfer prices were used as ``best information available''for both the COP and CV calculations because: (1) The companies representedthat they could not provide costs for each component and for the processingwork performed by related companies; (2) substantially all of the salesof the related subcontractors were to their related company; (3) transferprices that were charged permitted these related subcontractors to recovertheir cost in aggregate; and (4) the adjustment of the transfer pricesof those components which were below cost to their actual cost would havea <T3>de minimis </T3>effect on the costs. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>Petitioner maintains that interest expense should notbe offset by interest income unless the Department has determined thatthe income is from ``compensating balances'' or investments from workingcapital. Any offset should be from interest income earned from the operationsof the company as opposed to investment activities of the company. SKF-France, Italy and U.K. argue that they only offset interest expenseby short-term interest income earned through investing cash generated fromoperations. This interest was derived from short-term interest bearinginstruments, commercial paper and government notes. NMB/Pelmec Singapore and NMB/Pelmec Thai claim that their responses wereverified and only interest from operations was included, <T3>e.g., </T3>bank deposits. Nachi argues that all items of non-operating income are directly relatedto the business operations and, in any case, the amount is negligible.NTN and NSK maintain that they properly offset their reported interestexpenses with interest income. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For FAG-FRG and FAG-Italy, the Department used theinterest expense of the FAG consolidated entity and deducted the interestincome from operations, <T3>e.g., </T3>income from bank deposits. The 1987 FAG consolidated interestexpense was used in the COP and CV calculations in the first quarter of1988 as ``best information available''. For NTN and NSK, much of the interest income was derived from investmentactivity as opposed to bearing manufacturing operations. For example, NTN'sinterest included income from convertible debentures and national bonds,profits on securities and negotiable instruments options. Similarly, NSK'sinterest income included profits on securities and negotiable instrumentsoptions, and other interest income which was not short-term. Since theDepartment determined that this interest income was not part of the incomederived from bearing manufacturing operations, it disallowed these itemsas interest income to offset interest expense. For Nachi, the Department used the interest expense of the most recentfiscal year of the consolidated entity. However, no offset was made becausethe company did not provide information regarding consolidated interestincome from operations nor was any detail provided in the consolidatedfinancial statements. For SKF-France, Italy, and U.K., the Department used the interest expensefrom SKF's consolidated financial statements, and deducted the portionof interest income related to current financial assets. For SKF-France,Italy and U.K., the 1987 SKF consolidated interest expense was also usedin the COP and CV calculations in the first quarter of 1988 as ``best informationavailable''. For NMB/Pelmec Singapore and NMB/Pelmec Thai, the Department verified thatthey had offset only interest income related to operations against interestexpenses. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should base interestexpense on the costs incurred by the ``consolidated corporate entity''for SKF-France, SKF-Italy, SKF-U.K., NMB/Pelmec Singapore, NMB/Pelmec Thaiand for Nachi. SKF argues that interest expense should be based on the interest incurredby each particular subsidiary, because SKF operates in many countries whichhave unique economic and market conditions. Including the experience ofthese other markets would seriously distort the information reported byany one country. NMB/Pelmec Singapore and NMB/Pelmec Thai contend that this change was madeduring verification and the result was insignificant. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department recognizes the fungible nature ofthe corporation's capital structure, <T3>i.e.,</T3> both debt and equity. Recognizing the global nature of theseoperations, we used the interest expense of the consolidated company. Forthe SKF companies, this adjustment resulted in a slight decrease in theinterest expense for SKF-France and U.K., while SKF-Italy remained approximatelythe same. For Nachi, the Department relied on the interest expense in theconsolidated financial statements. However, because the company did notprovide specific consolidated information regarding interest income, noadjustment was made. For NMB/Pelmec Singapore and NMB/Pelmec Thai therewere slight increases.<T3>Comment 4. </T3>Petitioner contends that for SKF-France, Italy andthe U.K., the Department must determine whether or not the price for steelobtained from a related company reflects arm's-length transaction pricesand whether it was above the COP. Further, petitioner argues these issuescould not be verified through cross comparison and, therefore, the Departmentshould use ``best information available'' to value the steel inputs purchasedfrom this related party. SKF-France, Italy and the U.K. state that prices charged by the relatedsteel producer are arm's-length prices and, accordingly, should be reliedupon for the COP and CV calculations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>For purposes of calculating COP, the Departmentdid not request information on the related supplier's cost of producingsteel because SKF did not own more than 50 percent of the related supplier.(<T3>See DOC Position </T3>in <T3>General Comment 1.</T3>) With respect to CV, we have accepted the transfer prices for this steel.As a result of the virtually unlimited variations possible in grade, size,diameter, purchase volume, certification requirement and surface treatment,there were no completely <T3>identical </T3>sales of steel to unrelated purchasers in the same market.Therefore, the Department was forced to test the prices charged by therelated supplier against the prices that the supplier charged for similarproducts. We also compared prices paid by SKF-France, Italy and U.K. tothe related supplier with prices paid by these SKF companies to unrelatedsuppliers or to bids received from unrelated suppliers. For SKF-Italy, the Department compared orders for similar steel productssourced from related and unrelated suppliers. For SKF-France, we comparedtwo instances of identical products purchased from a related and unrelatedsupplier. For SKF-U.K., we compared purchasing department schedules ofprice quotes obtained from both related and unrelated suppliers. In eachinstance, the price variations appeared to be supported by the circumstancesof the sale. Based on these comparisons, the Department concluded that the transferprices of steel products obtained from the related company were withina reasonable range of the prices charged by unrelated suppliers for themost comparable products and, therefore, fairly reflected the value inthe market under consideration. Accordingly, the Department relied on thetransfer prices of the steel. <T3>Comment 5. </T3>Petitioner argues that, with respect to SKF-France,Italy and U.K., Randamp;D expenditures of a product specific nature mustbe allocated to the particular product or part. Failure to indicate productspecific Randamp;D warrants the use of ``best information available'' ortreatment of all Randamp;D expenses as overhead. SKF-France, Italy and U.K. state that the Randamp;D efforts of the researchcenter cannot be applied to a particular product because they are, in fact,general in nature. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department determined that Randamp;D activitiesundertaken at the SKF-Netherlands facility were primarily of a generalnature. Specific projects conducted at this facility were charged directlyto the appropriate related company and, therefore, were included by thesecompanies in their costs. As the nature of these activities of the researchfacility appear to be of a more general nature, the costs were consideredto be Gandamp;A expenses. <T3>Comment 6. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should rejectthe depreciation expense reported by SKF-France, Italy and U.K. becausethe companies purchased equipment manufactured by other SKF companies.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department accepted SKF-France, Italy, and U.K.depreciation expense for equipment obtained from a related company becausewe verified that equipment produced within the SKF-Group was transferredwithin the Group above the full cost, including the Gandamp;A expenses ofthe producing company. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Petitioner contends that the responses of SKF-France,Italy and U.K., and FAG-FRG and Italy were inadequate because the submissionswere not adequately supported. Therefore, the Department should use ``bestinformation available.'' <T3>DOC Response. </T3>The Department used information provided by therespondents for the final determination because we concluded that the methodologyused for the responses adequately captured and allocated all costs attributableto the products. Also, we found during verification that the informationused was sufficiently supported. The Department reviewed the issues raisedby the petitioner, the methodology used by the respondents, and the majoritems related to the production costs during verification. The methodologyof the submission, the procedures and its findings are described in thecost verification report, public versions of which are on file in RoomB-099 of the Commerce Building. <T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioner argues that depreciation expenses recordedin the cost accounting records of SKF-France, Italy and U.K. should notbe changed from a ``reacquisition value'' basis to a historical cost basis. SKF-France, Italy, and U.K. argue that they use depreciation based uponhistorical cost for financial statement purposes, in accordance with theaccounting principles of each country. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department agrees that it is appropriate tochange the depreciation recorded in the cost accounting records from a``reacquisition value'' basis to a historical cost basis. U.S. GAAP andthe GAAP of the relevant countries require that depreciation be calculatedon a historical cost basis, not on a replacement value basis. The reacquisitionvalue of assets for depreciation expense was used by these companies onlyfor the internal cost system. The consolidated financial statements werebased on historical costs.<T3>Comment 9.</T3> Petitioner argues that interest expense reported byNTN and NSK did not include interest expense paid on bonds by NTN and amortizationof bond issue expense by NSK. NSK maintains that this was an ``extraordinary'' expense associated withthe issuance of a Eurodollar bond offering, pertaining to NSK's worldwideoperations. As such, NSK believes this expense must be allocated basedon the cost of sales for all NSK companies. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> For calculating interest expense, the Departmentallocates the total interest expense to the total operations of the consolidatedcorporation based on cost of sales. Accordingly, the Department includedthe interest expense on bonds incurred by NTN and the amortization of bondissue expense incurred by NSK in the respective total interest expensecalculated for each company for both COP and CV calculations. <T3>Comment 10.</T3> Petitioner alleges that general expenses submittedby NTN, NSK, and Nachi omitted losses incurred on the disposal of fixedassets and write-downs/write-offs of inventories. The petitioner notesthat the portion of these expenses attributable to the POI should be includedin the COP. NTN, NSK, and Nachi maintain that fixed asset disposals and write-downs/write-offsof inventory are considered non-operating in nature by the accounting methodologyof the country under investigation and should not be included in the reportedCOP. However, NSK requests that, if the Department includes expenses incurredin the disposal of fixed assets and write-down/write-offs of inventoryin the COP, it also include the income amounts generated by such disposals.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department views losses on the sale or disposalof fixed assets and write-downs/write-offs of inventory as a normal costof producing the products which should be reflected in the product's COP.These expenses incurred by NTN, NSK and Nachi were allocated to the productas part of a general expense over the total cost of sales. The Departmentconsiders any income or credits generated by these transactions as an offsetagainst the expense to arrive at the actual cost incurred by the company.<T3>Comment 11.</T3> Petitioner argues that the Department should includedepreciation on NTN's and NSK's idle machinery in the COP. NTN and NSK note that the accounting methodology in Japan allows a companyto stop depreciation on idle assets. Accordingly, the Department shouldnot include depreciation expense on idle machinery in the COP of the subjectmerchandise, as it was not an expense in the respondents' normal cost accountingsystems. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department includes in the fully absorbed factoryoverhead the depreciation of equipment not in use or temporarily idle.While Japan's accounting methodology does provide that  depreciation foridle equipment may be stopped, the Department does not accept this accountingmethod, reasoning that idle fixed assets are a cost to the company andshould be absorbed in the COP. Accordingly, depreciation expense for therespondents' idle machinery was included in the cost of manufacturing.(b) Company-Specific Comments <ITAG tagnum="81">France </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner contends that restructuring expenses incurredby Les Applications du Roulement (ADR), an SKF company in France, shouldbe allocated to the products under investigation for purposes of the finaldetermination. SKF-France argues that these are ``extraordinary costs'' which happenedto occur during the POI and that they should be excluded from the COP andCV calculations, or amortized over an appropriate period. Further, shouldthese extraordinary costs be included in the COP and CV calculations, theDepartment should not disregard sales below the COP in determining FMV.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with petitioner. The unauditedfinancial statements of ADR term the restructuring costs ``unusual expenses''.In France, material events which may not be considered extraordinary itemsby either French or U.S. GAAP require special disclosure. However, U.S.as well as French GAAP dictate that an event must be both unusual in natureand not expected to recur in the foreseeable future to be considered extraordinary.During verification, the respondent did not provide detail which wouldestablish that this restructuring meets the criteria to be considered anextraordinary item. Therefore, the restructuring expenses were treatedas a period cost consistent with U.S. GAAP. As best information available,the restructuring expenses were allocated on the basis of cost of goodssold of ADR's parent company, SFI-SKF, for the fiscal year 1987. Becausewe treated restructuring expenses as ordinary costs, they were includedin our COP calculation. <T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner argues that the understatement of corporateGandamp;A expense should be corrected for purposes of the final determinationand that the consolidated percentage of Gandamp;A should be used rather thanthe country-specific amount due to the global nature of SKF. SKF-France claims that the misstatement of the corporate expenses was correctedat verification and, in any event, was <T3>de minimis.</T3> Further, country-specific Gandamp;A is appropriate forthe COP/CV calculations because the consolidated Gandamp;A percentage includessome expenses which are classified at the subsidiary level as overheadcosts. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with petitioner that the understatementof corporate expenses should be corrected for the final determination,and such correction has been made. However, we agree with SKF-France thatits country-specific Gandamp;A, including its appropriate share of corporateGandamp;A, should be used for the COP and CV calculations. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> Petitioner argues that Randamp;D expenditures of theSKF Netherlands facility must be allocated to all related companies whichbenefit from its Randamp;D activities, including ADR.SKF-France states that the Randamp;D efforts of the research center are properlyallocated to those companies which benefit from it, specifically the companyshareholders who develop new products. New developments of the researchfacility would first be instituted by the shareholders and, therefore,they bear all costs. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department accepted SKF's method of allocatingthe SKF Netherlands research center costs. SKF has represented that anyimprovements to the production process would be available, at first, onlyto the research center shareholders. Allocating the center's costs to eachof the shareholders assigns a portion of these costs to ball bearing productionin France, through SKF Clamart. Randamp;D specific to miniature bearing productswas carried out at ADR and appropriately included in ADR's costs. The Federal Republic of Germany <T3>Comment 4.</T3> The petitioner argues that GMN's employee benefitsshould be allocated on the basis of direct labor costs and should not beincluded in fabrication overhead. GMN argues that an adjustment is not necessary because employee benefitsare included in fabrication overhead, which is allocated on the basis ofdirect labor. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with GMN. The Department examined the fabricationoverhead and determined that employee benefit costs were included in thesecosts. Since fabrication overhead is allocated based on direct labor, anadjustment is not necessary.<T3>Comment 5.</T3> GMN argues that its first quarter 1988 costs shouldnot be used to compute average production costs for comparison to salesprices because accruals, based on estimated amounts, were included in thosecosts. GMN suggests that, if the Department decides to use the first quarter1988 costs, these costs should be weight-averaged with the actual costdata from fiscal year 1987. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department used the first quarter 1988 COP data.All accounting data is based on some estimates in determining costs, andin this case, there were no indications that the estimates used for thefirst quarter 1988 were inaccurate. The Department did not average thetwo quarters but compared the fourth quarter 1987 and the first quarter1988 costs to the sales made during the respective quarters. <T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner argues that GMN's interest income and debtinterest to shareholders should not be deducted from the total interestexpense. The source of interest income is not known. Therefore, it shouldnot be allowed as an offset. GMN argues that interest income is interest received from customers foraccounts receivable and therefore, should be offset against interest expense.With respect to interest paid on a loan from a primary shareholder, thatinterest resembles a pre-profit distribution and should not be includedas an interest expense.<T3>DOC Position. </T3> The Department determined that a portion of interestincome pertains to interest GMN received from customers for accounts receivable,and has allowed this portion as an offset to total interest expense. Theloan to GMN from a shareholder does not differ from other debt. Therefore,the interest paid on that loan was treated as an interest expense. <T3>Comment 7.</T3> Petitioner argues that GMN reported only costs to producea single ball for each bearing in their submission, rather than costs forall the balls contained in the bearing. GMN argues that all costs for the balls contained in each bearing werereported. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department verified that the costs of all ballsrequired for each type of bearing were reported in the respondent's submission.<T3>Comment 8.</T3> Petitioner contends that FAG-FRG data should be rejectedin favor of best information available because the total cost system wasinadequately supported, cost data were not submitted in an appropriateformat, and the Department cannot ensure whether transfers of raw materials,part, or components from related parties were made at arm's-length prices.FAG-FRG contends that best information available should not be used. Thecompany states that the methodology used for its submission did not relyon the total cost system and that documents and calculations used for itssubmission were fully tested and verified. Also, the company argues thatvirtually all parts used in FAG-FRG bearings are either manufactured byFAG in its own factories from basic materials or purchased from unrelatedsuppliers, except for specialized balls which accounted for only a minusculeproportion of FAG's consumption of balls. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department did not use ``best information available''for the final determinations because it concluded that the methodologyused for the response adequately captured and allocated all costs to theproducts under investigation. Also, we found during verification that theinformation used was sufficiently supported. Finally, we confirmed thatthe amount of parts from a related company was insignificant and therewould be no impact on costs. <T3>Comment 9.</T3> Petitioner contends that FAG-FRG's COP response shouldbe rejected because FAG did not provide a reconciliation between two costsystems during verification. Therefore, the Department cannot ensure thatcosts reported in one system are consistent with costs recorded in theother system and internal inconsistencies between these systems may bereflected in the cost submission. FAG-FRG contends that it fully explained and reconciled the two systems,contrary to petitioner's allegation. A new system was only used to providethe relative breakdown of cost elements of each sampled bearing. A consistentset of current standard costs was used for the calculation of productioncost variances. The cost submission was the result of these calculations,and not those involving the standard costs of bearings from the new costsystem. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department did not use ``best information available''because FAG-FRG was able to reconcile the two cost systems. We verifiedthat FAG-FRG's information could be relied upon for the final determinations.<T3>Comment 10.</T3> Petitioner contends that because FAG-FRG relied onan incorrect figure in its submission, the Department should revise thecost of goods sold for the rolling bearings division to determine if homemarket sales were made below the COP. FAG-FRG contends that the cost of goods sold for the division was slightlyunderstated due to an arithmetic error and the total effect of this adjustmentwas insignificant. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> For the final determination, the Department revisedthe submitted cost of goods sold of the rolling bearings division basedon verified information. <T3>Comment 11.</T3> Petitioner contends that all consulting fees incurredby FAG-FRG for 1987 should be considered costs during the POI instead ofthe amortized amount for 1987 which was reflected in the Gandamp;A. Theyclaim this type of expense can be incurred or expected during normal businessoperations and, therefore, is not an extraordinary cost.FAG-FRG contends that such consulting studies rarely occur within manufacturingcompanies such as FAG-FRG. It amortized these expenses over the fifteen-yearperiod of its expected benefits and properly included the amortized amountin Gandamp;A expenses. Therefore, its approach for the treatment of sucha large and infrequent expense is correct and proper. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with petitioner. Although the company claimedsuch expenses were of an infrequent nature and should be amortized, itdid not support that this treatment would have been in accordance withGerman GAAP. Accordingly, the Department did not amortize the expense andincluded the consulting fee in the Gandamp;A expenses. <T3>Comment 12. </T3>Petitioner contends that the FAG-FRG claim for a creditto the 1987 costs should not be allowed. The credit is from a year-endadjustment to the maintenance reserve account which was established andfunded in 1986. Petitioner argues that FAG provided no documentary evidencedemonstrating that any expenses for funding a reserve were part of the1987 costs. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department did not allow this credit to 1987costs resulting from the year-end adjustment. Since the expense of thisprovision was recognized in 1986, the credit should not be made to the1987 costs. <T3>Comment 13. </T3>Petitioner contends that various issues were raisedin its prehearing brief regarding the derivation and allocation of depreciationexpenses, Randamp;D expenses, subcontracting costs, the general unreliabilityand inconsistency of the reported costs, and FAG-FRG's failure to providethe COP data in the required format. Given that such issues were not addressedat verification, the Department should consider large portions of FAG'sresponse as unverified and should use ``best information available'' forpurposes of making the final determination. FAG-FRG contends that no costs were excluded or misclassified in its submissionregarding the issues raised by the petitioner and these issues were verifiedand resolved. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department reviewed the issues raised by thepetitioner, the methodology used by the respondent, and the major itemsrelated to the production costs during verification. The Department describedthe methodology of the submission, the procedures, and its findings inthe cost verification report. We concluded that the verified informationcould be relied upon for the final determination. <T3>Comment 14. </T3>FAG-FRG contends that consistent with its recent decision(See <T3>Certain All-Terrain Vehicles from Japan, </T3>54 FR 4864 (1989)), theDepartment should not include imputed credit or inventory carrying costsin COP. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree and have followed the practice adoptedin the above-cited case. <T3>Comment 15. </T3>Petitioner argues that the INA-FRG response was notverified and the Department should use best information otherwise available.For example, standard costs were not reconciled to actual costs, althoughdifferences between standard and actual costs were noted for every costelement tested. Additionally, certain costs may not have been included,such as general expenses, waste, and inventory write-downs. INA-FRG argues that ``the determination of whether INA's COP submissionwas adequately verified should be based on whether the COP calculationswere reasonably based on actual costs, not whether INA was able to tieeach and every element of its standard costs into the company's financialstatements''. INA-FRG has stated that it utilized its cost system for the response and,like other respondents, has also stated on the record that it does notcompute variances. Therefore, it concludes that the Department must decideif the response was reasonably based on actual costs. INA-FRG states thatthrough the Department's testing of material prices and labor rates, itshould conclude that standard costs were reasonably based on actual experience.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department did not consider the INA-FRG's COPresponse to be verified. In response to the Department's request for actualcosts, INA-FRG stated that ``the cost of manufacturing per product is basedon costs of the processes employed in the manufacture of the particularproducts and includes any costs attributable to a certain process''. Thecompany also explained that its response was ``based on our cost accountingsystem,'' adjusted for imputed interest and replacement depreciation whichwere items not included in the financial system. During the course of the verification, it became evident that the costof manufacturing was not based on the costs of the processes employed inthe manufacturing of the particular product, nor was it based on the costsystem adjusted for the items not included in the financial system. INA's submitted COP for the POI was based on product standard costs whichwere neither part of the cost accounting system nor the financial accountingsystem. Additionally, INA was not able to supply any documentation forthe standard costs used in the submission. Therefore, no underlying supportwas provided for the costs of all of the numerous products in the response.The company did provide an index which it claimed to have used to adjust1987 standards to 1988. However, the basis for the 1987 standards was notfurnished. Prior to discovery that the product standards were not a part of the costsystem, the Department tested certain items in an attempt to reconcilethe standard costs to actual costs. When the price of materials, the laborrate and other items were compared to invoices and payroll records, etc.,differences were noted in all cases. Also, INA did not provide any meansto tie the product standards to the cost system, or to the actual costsrecorded in the financial system. Therefore, the quantity of these inputs(material, labor, etc.) could not be verified. Additionally, numerous other discrepancies were noted. An important discrepancywas discovered between the detailed product cost totals provided for thenine products to be used as a sample for verification and that part ofthe submission, listing the COP for all products, which the Departmentrelies upon to determine whether home market sales are at prices belowthe COP. Although INA-FRG stated in its response that variances were not developedin the normal course of business (<T3>e.g., </T3>FAG-FRG, and GMN), this was not the reason why INA's methodologycould not be accepted. The other respondents, unlike INA, had used productstandard costs which tied to the cost system and had developed verifiablevariances to adjust standard to actual costs for the submissions. The Department could not accept INA-FRG's ``reasonably close to actual''standards. To do so would result in inaccuracies which would yield inequitableresults to not only the petitioner but to other respondents. Because of the methodology used by the company for its response, the inabilityof the company to reconcile the submission to actual costs of the product,and the lack of documentary support for the data, the Department has rejectedthe INA-FRG's cost data and has used ``best information available'' forcylindrical bearings produced and exported in the FRG by INA. <ITAG tagnum="81">Italy </ITAG><T3>Comment 16. </T3>Petitioner alleges that since FAG-Italy cannot obtainthe cost for spherical roller bearings from its joint venture company,the price charged by FAG to an unrelated company for the spherical rollerbearings should be used as ``best information available''.FAG-Italy states that the only appropriate basis for determining the COPof spherical roller bearings obtained from its joint venture is the transferprice because of the unique terms of the agreement and because FAG hasno management control or access to the joint venture costs. Additionally,it argues that the small loss incurred in that year by the joint ventureshould not be added to the transfer price because, in accordance with GAAP,this loss is not included as a manufacturing cost on the financial statements.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with FAG-Italy in part. Transferprices were used for the COP/CV calculations because FAG-Italy could notobtain the actual costs to produce the spherical roller bearings from itsjoint venture. However, we have increased the transfer price between thejoint venture and FAG-Italy to reflect the loss incurred during the POIbecause the transfer prices in aggregate were below the cost to producethe bearings and the loss of the joint venture must be absorbed by theparticipants of the joint venture. <T3>Comment 17.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should notaccept the information FAG-Italy provided during verification correctingthe COP of components because it constitutes a new submission. FAG-Italy states that the information provided at verification was nota new submission because it related to the parts of a bearing, not thetotal COP, and that a correction of a calculation error does not constitutea new submission. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> FAG-Italy identified the calculation error on atimely basis and provided the appropriate adjustments. Correction of oneerror in the submission does not constitute a new response. The Departmentwas able to verify the actual cost of the parts at the parent company andthat the same cost was properly included in FAG-Italy's cost submissionfor ball bearings. <T3>Comment 18.</T3> Petitioner claims that FAG-Italy's COP should be corrected:(1) For a material usage variance which was calculated as a differencebetween the amounts recorded in the internal accounting system and itsfinancial statements; (2) for the depreciation expense that would havebeen recorded to account for the difference between the market value andthe price paid to its parent for certain equipment; (3) to include Gandamp;Aof the parent company in FRG for Umbra-made products with the CV calculation;(4) for consulting fees incurred during the period of investigation thatshould be expensed and not amortized over fifteen years, since the respondentcould not adequately substantiate that these fees were an extraordinaryitem. FAG-Italy claims that: (1) The total amount of the difference in materialusage between the internal accounting systems and its financial statementswas included in the cost of manufacturing for the submission; (2) the increasein depreciation is not relevant because only a small percentage of equipmentis purchased from the parent and that the transfer price represents cost;(3) Gandamp;A expenses of the parent were not added to cost of componentsobtained from the parent because the transfer price included an allocationof the Gandamp;A; and (4) that consulting studies rarely occur within manufacturingcompanies such as FAG-Italy. Therefore, its approach for the treatmentof such a large and infrequent expense is correct and proper. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with FAG-Italy on point (1)and with petitioner on points (2), (3), and (4). Although the materialpurchase price variance was classified as variable overhead instead ofas a material cost, the Department has determined that no adjustment isnecessary because the variance is included in cost of manufacturing andthe amount in question is <T3>de minimis. </T3>Depreciation expense was adjusted to reflect the amountof depreciation expense the respondent would have recorded had it purchasedthe equipment from its parent at an arm's length price. Gandamp;A expensesof the parent were included in the CV calculations of ball bearings manufacturedin Umbra because the actual costs of the components were used. Gandamp;Aexpenses were adjusted to include FAG-Italy's portion of all consultingfees incurred by the parent company, since these expenses could not besubstantiated as extraordinary and amortized as the company suggested.<T3>Comment 19.</T3> Petitioner contends that FAG-Italy's response shouldbe rejected because costs were reconfigured for the purposes of the submission.FAG-Italy contends that its costs were not modified and, in fact, werederived directly from company books and records kept in the normal courseof business. During 1987, the Umbra plant had one cost center area. During1988, the same plant was divided into three cost center areas. FAG-Italystates that in order to calculate product costs for the submission, itmade a three-area division of costs on a pro forma basis for 1987. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with FAG-Italy. The Department verifiedthat the division of the 1987 cost into three cost center areas was consistentwith FAG-Italy's records. <T3>Comment 20.</T3> SKF-Italy states that costs incurred during the periodof investigation for cylindrical roller bearings were not ``ordinary''.It claims that the single cylindrical roller bearing sold during the periodof investigation was a prototype and, thus, incurred significant laborand overhead expenses over a small lot size. Therefore, these ``start-upcosts'' should be capitalized and amortized over an appropriate periodof time or volume of production. Petitioner claims that the Department could verify neither the actual northe standard costs of the product in periods subsequent to the POI and,thus, could not determine if costs incurred during the period of investigationwere ``ordinary''. Petitioner argues that the actual costs submitted andverified at the company should be used.  <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees that the actual costs submittedand verified at the company should be used to determine the CV of the cylindricalroller bearing. We were not able to verify the standard costs for cylindricalroller bearings in periods subsequent to the POI, because exhibits to supportsuch information were submitted after the verification was completed. Inaddition, standard costs only reflect management's estimate of the product'scost and do not reflect the <T3>actual </T3>cost of the product. Thus, the Department could not determineif the costs incurred by the respondent during the POI were ordinary costsor not. Therefore, we have used the verified cost during the POI to computeCV. <T3>Comment 21.</T3> Petitioner argues for SKF-Italy that valve tappetsare a type of needle roller bearing specifically within the scope of theinvestigation and, thus, costs associated with this product should be includedin the reported cost data. SKF-Italy argues that its valve tappets bear none of the characteristicsof a bearing and, thus, costs related to its manufacture are properly excludedfrom the investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have determined that the ``valve tappets'' inquestion do not contain rolling elements and are not like spherical plainbearings. They are not physically similiar to the products under investigation.Therefore, we agree with SKF-Italy and have not included any costs relatedto its ``valve tappets'' in our calculations.<T3>Comment 22. </T3>SKF-Italy argues that an adjustment made to the financialstatements to allocate variances between ``cost of sales'' and ``inventory''should also be included in indices used to calculate actual unit costs.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree. The financial statement adjustmentconverts inventory from standard cost to actual cost. SKF-Italy providedthe actual fabrication costs for production during the period. Whetherthis production has been sold or remains in inventory has no impact onthe COP. Therefore, this adjustment cannot be applied to the COP. <ITAG tagnum="81">Japan </ITAG><T3>Comment 23. </T3>Petitioner contends that Nachi's depreciation costsmay have been inaccurately reflected in the submission because of the accelerateddepreciation methods used by Nachi and the values and methods used fordepreciating the equipment made by its machine tool division. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department verified Nachi's depreciation reportedin its response. The depreciation method was in accordance with JapaneseGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles and Japanese Tax Law. At verification,the Department found no evidence that the company had used an unusuallyfast accelerated method of depreciation or an economic useful life forthe assets which did not fairly reflect the value of those assets. Additionally,the Department verified that equipment made by Nachi's machine tool divisionwas recorded on its books at the division's cost to manufacture the equipment.<T3>Comment 24. </T3>Petitioner argues that Nachi's Gandamp;A expenses wereinaccurately reflected in the submission because the related subcontractor'sGandamp;A costs were not included in its COP submission. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department verified the components and the allocationof expenses within the Gandamp;A expense to the various bearings. The Departmentfound no inaccuracies within Nachi's submission. Additionally, the Departmentverified that the related subcontractor's Gandamp;A expenses were properlyincluded in Nachi's reported Gandamp;A expenses. <T3>Comment 25. </T3>Petitioner argues that since Nachi did not submitreliable CV information, the Department should use the FMV data as ``bestinformation available'' for CV purposes. Nachi argues that there is no basis for the use of CV. It also argues thatif CV were to be used, the Department should use Nachi's submitted costsas a basis for the CV. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In submitting transfer prices for CV purposes, Nachiadjusted for intercompany profit/loss. As a result, Nachi's CV was lessthan COP for bearings which were fabricated by related subcontractors operatingat a loss. The Department did not consider transfer prices below cost asreflecting the fair market value for the processes performed by the relatedsubcontractors. Therefore, as best information available, the Departmentbased CV on the actual costs of components from related subcontractors.<T3>Comment 26. </T3>Petitioner alleges that NSK's cost data submittedafter verification should be rejected. Petitioner maintains that the Departmentshould reject those portions of the response which are materially deficientor which were not fully supported at verification. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>NSK's original computer tape had provided cost informationfor only one quarter of the POI. The revised tape, received <T3>prior </T3>to verification, provided average cost information for bothquarters of the POI. On this revised tape, cost data was not provided forsome products. Where NSK's cost information for a product was not providedon the revised tape, the Department used ``best information available''.<T3>Comment 27. </T3>Petitioner alleges that the costs of the NSK EnvironmentalControl Department should be allocated to the merchandise under investigationand included in the total COP. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Environmental Control Department is part ofNSK's headquarters operations and, as such, its costs are included in theGandamp;A expenses which have been verified and are a part of the products'COP. <T3>Comment 28. </T3>Petitioner contends that the manner in which NTN hasreported its production costs shifts its costs away from certain partsthat are identical to those sold for export to the United States, therebyskewing the calculation of less than fair value margins. NTN denies petitioner's allegation of ``skewed'' cost data, and claimsthat its actual costs as reported are based on its regularly kept accountingrecords. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department verified NTN's response and did notfind any skewing of the submitted cost data. NTN's submitted cost datais derived directly from NTN's own cost accounting records. <T3>Comment 29. </T3>Petitioner alleges that non-bearing Randamp;D expensesincurred by NTN, <T3>i.e., </T3>at the Randamp;D Plant, should be added to the productioncosts for purposes of the final determination. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Our review of this Research Facility indicated thatthe Randamp;D conducted there was of a product-specific nature for productsnot subject to this investigation. Accordingly, we did not allocate thisRandamp;D to either the COP or the CV of the products under investigationfor purposes of the final determination. <ITAG tagnum="81">Romania </ITAG><T3>Comment 30. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not offsetthe COP by the revenues from scrap sales because the cost of removing nonrecoverablescrap offsets the revenue generated from the sale of scrap.Tehnoimportexport (TIE) argues that an adjustment should be made for thevalue of scrap and the amount should be the difference between the grossand net weight. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>Since costs to remove scrap are normally a partof overhead, the Department deducted a value for scrap sales from materialcosts when information was provided to support the amount of scrap sold.The Department disallowed a deduction for nonrecoverable scrap from materialcosts. <T3>Comment 31. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not relyon the factors of production information submitted by TIE due to the lackof support and inaccuracy of material portions of the response. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department used the submitted factors of productionadjusted for any differences noted during verification. However, when thefactors could not be supported, the Department used ``best informationavailable''. <T3>Comment 32. </T3>Petitioner and TIE argue that the factory overheadrate used in the preliminary determination, which was based on TIE's cost,should not be used since it was based on the input costs which were determinedin a ``state-controlled'' economy. Both parties suggest that the rate bebased on the experience of a manufacturer of a similar product in a surrogatecountry. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department agrees. The Department utilized afactory overhead rate from Portugal, the surrogate country selected forthe final determination. <T3>Comment 33. </T3>Petitioner argues that the quantities submitted bythe Romanian factories for energy and utilities are inconsistent and unverifiedand, therefore, should not be used. TIE argues that their submission methodology inaccurately states the utilitycost for all bearing types. Respondent suggests that utility costs be calculatedas a percentage of total raw materials and labor. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department agrees with petitioner that the submittedinformation could not be verified. However, energy and utility costs wereincluded in the overhead provided by the surrogate country. As such, wedid not need to calculate separate factors for utility costs. <T3>Comment 34. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department erroneouslyrelied on data submitted by TIE for the valuation of cold-rolled coil asthe input into steel balls. Petitioner argues that such balls are manufacturedfrom bearing quality (52100) steel bar, wire or wire rod, not cold-rolledsheet in coil. Therefore, the Department should use the value of steelbar wire or wire rod in the valuation of balls. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with petitioner and have used the surrogatevalue for 52100 steel bar to value balls contained in TIE's ball bearing.<ITAG tagnum="81">Singapore </ITAG><T3>Comment 35. </T3>Petitioner argues that it would be inappropriate forthe Department to rely on NMB/Pelmec Singapore's development of a standardcost system for purposes of the investigation. A standard cost system mustrely on historical costs, analysis and the calculation of cost variances.If a developed standard cost system uses only production data, variouscosts may be understated. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree. NMB/Pelmec Singapore does not maintaina standard cost accounting system in the ordinary course of business. Forpurposes of the investigation, the respondent developed standard costsfor each product only as a means of allocating actual costs to the individualproducts. These standards were based on engineering standards which wereused by NMB/Pelmec Singapore in its operations. The Department concludedthat the response adequately captured and allocated all of the actual coststo the products, and that the information as verified could be relied uponfor the final determination. <T3>Comment 36. </T3>Petitioner argues that NMB/Pelmec Singapore's assumptionof ``full capacity operation'' during the POI results in lower standardcosts and understates the CV. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree. The costs resulting from less than``full capacity operations'' would be reflected in the actual costs. Theactual costs were used for the submission but were allocated proportionatelybased on standards. All actual costs were accounted for in the cost ofthe products since the standard costs were adjusted to actual costs. <T3>Comment 37. </T3>Petitioner states that process times reported by thetwo Singaporean companies for the same components show discrepancies. Petitionerfurther states that the set-up time or downtime costs were not includedin process time, thereby understating these costs. NMB/Pelmec Singapore argues that although set-up time and downtime werenot included in respondent's cycle times, the total costs incurred duringset-up and downtime were included in total actual costs. Therefore, thesecosts were allocated to each product in the same ratio as that product'scycle time to total cycle time of all products. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with respondent. The Department determinedthat NMB/Pelmec Singapore's allocation of fabrication costs included allactual costs incurred during the POI by reconciling the product costs backto the costs included in the financial statements. The Department concludedthat the costs for downtime were included in total costs and that the respondent'smethodology adequately captured and allocated fabrication costs to theproducts. <T3>Comment 38. </T3>Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Singapore understatedraw material costs below world market levels. NMB/Pelmec Singapore argues that end-of-period inventory values were usedas a method of only allocating raw material costs incurred during the POI.It also contends that, for purposes of valuing inventory, actual materialcosts were calculated by a weighted-average method. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree with petitioner. The Department's verificationof raw material costs included an examination of actual invoices. Totalmaterial costs were adequately reflected in the cost submission exceptfor the minor discrepancies noted in the verification report. Except incases in which an adjustment would have had no effect on costs, the Departmentadjusted NMB/Pelmec Singapore's submitted raw material costs to reconcilesuch discrepancies. <T3>Comment 39. </T3>Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Singapore hassegregated all costs associated with scrap and waste, along with the revenueearned from the sale of scrap, and treated such costs as an extraordinaryitem. Because scrap and waste are production costs and should be includedin the cost of manufacturing, the Department should utilize the scrap rateas submitted by petitioner. NMB/Pelmec Singapore argues that all material costs, including scrap, wereincluded in production costs. Any revenue received from the sale of scrapis included in other income.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with respondent. The Department examinedNMB/Pelmec Singapore's calculations and determined that scrap had beenincluded in raw material costs. NMB/Pelmec Singapore also included therevenue received from scrap sales in other income. The Department tracedthe details of particular scrap sales to original invoices and determinedthat the respondent's methodology of accounting for scrap was acceptable.<T3>Comment 40.</T3> Petitioner argues that Gandamp;A expenses of NMB/PelmecSingapore's parent company should be included in the cost of the subsidiary.NMB/Pelmec Singapore contends that it partially allocated the Gandamp;A expensesfrom the parent company to the subsidiaries. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with petitioner. Accordingly,we adjusted the respondent's costs by fully allocating the Gandamp;A expensesof the parent company to the subsidiaries for purposes of the final determination.<ITAG tagnum="81">Thailand </ITAG><T3>Comment 41.</T3> Petitioner argues that best information availableshould be used for NMB/Pelmec Thai's material costs because: 1) quantitydifferences were not recognized, and 2) the lowest price of steel duringthe POI, that of March 1987, was used for the response. NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that raw material costs incurred at the end ofthe period were used only to allocate costs. For purposes of valuing inventory,material costs were based on the weighted-average method. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with NMB/Pelmec Thai's methodologyof allocating raw material costs to the individual products. The respondentutilized standards in order to allocate quantity to the individual bearingsand raw material costs which were based on a weighted-average inventory,not on March 1987 prices. The standards were reconciled to the actual costsincurred during the POI and variances were applied. The Department determinedthrough standard verification procedures that the submitted cost informationcould be relied upon for the final determination. <T3>Comment 42.</T3> Petitioner contends that no offset to material costsfor scrap revenue should be permitted for NMB/Pelmec Thai because the detailedinformation (<T3>e.g., </T3>volume of scrap sold, scrap recovery) was not provided.NMB/Pelmec Thai argues that its methodology includes the amount of scrapin the raw material cost for each bearing. Any revenue received from thesale of scrap is included in other income. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with respondent. The Department examinedNMB/Pelmec Thai's calculations and determined that scrap had been includedin raw material costs. NMB/Pelmec Thai included the revenue received fromscrap sales in other income. The Department traced the details of particularscrap sales to original invoices and determined that the respondent's methodologyof accounting for scrap was acceptable for the final determination. <T3>Comment 43.</T3> Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Thai's labor costsmay not be accurate for the following reasons: (1) The company made anunjustified adjustment to reconcile labor costs incurred during the POIto those costs which would have been incurred for the products sold duringthe POI; and (2) costs allocated on the basis of cycle time may not haveincluded downtime. NMB/Pelmec Thai states that the fabrication costs were based on total actualexpenses. Cycle time was used only to allocate these costs. Therefore,the downtime costs were included in total actual fabrication expense. Downtimecosts were allocated to all bearings in the same proportion as the relativeamount of cycle time. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with respondent. The Department determinedthat NMB/Pelmec Thai's allocation of fabrication costs included all actualcosts incurred during the POI by reconciling the product costs back tothe costs included in the financial statements. The Department concludedthat the costs for downtime were included in total costs and that the respondent'smethodology adequately captured and allocated fabrication costs to theproducts. <T3>Comment 44.</T3> Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Thai's depreciationexpense is distorted because the respondent's method utilizes a twenty-yearuseful life while the parent company depreciates the same type of equipmentover a ten-year useful life. NMB/Pelmec Thai claims that the depreciation method utilized is the prevailingmethod in Thailand, is accepted by government tax authorities and therebyconforms with the Department's requirements. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department agrees with petitioner. The depreciationmethod should be adjusted to reflect the economic useful life of the assets.The Department adjusted depreciation to reflect the amount of expense basedon a ten-year life, which was the useful life of the asset used by itsparent. <T3>Comment 45.</T3> Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Thai understatedoverhead for the following reasons: (1) Energy costs may not have includedall types of energy and the energy costs of departments indirectly relatedto operations; (2) tooling costs were not specifically identified witheach part; (3) the percentage failure rate at the grinding department wasnot provided; and (4) Randamp;D was not included in the specific products.NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that all fabrication costs have been adequatelysupported and verified. It also states that Randamp;D performed by theirparent company is unrelated to the products manufactured in Thailand andthat only minor engineering costs, which have been included in the costof manufacturing, apply to these products. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with respondent. The Department reconciledthe product fabrication costs to the companies' financial statements forthe POI and adequately included the energy costs, tooling costs, and thecosts of the grinding department by allocating total actual fabricationcosts incurred during the POI. The Department verified that Randamp;D performedby the parent company was unrelated to the products manufactured in Thailandand was not included in the CV calculations. <T3>Comment 46.</T3> Petitioner contends that the Department should usethe actual profit, which would be higher than the statutory 8 percent ifthe actual profit were based only on sales transactions to unrelated companies.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> Because the Thai home market was not viable, wedo not have data representative of home market profit. If not for the latestage of the investigation, we would have requested, analyzed, and verifiedthird country sales data and used that information to calculate foreignmarket value. Furthermore, since third country sales data would otherwisehave been used, we have calculated profit based on the third country salesdata that is available. In the absence of complete information on thirdcountry sales, as best information available, we have used data pertainingto the NMB/Pelmec Thai's sales to Singapore (which were reported as domesticsales) to calculate profit. <ITAG tagnum="81">United Kingdom </ITAG><T3>Comment 47.</T3> Petitioner claims that RHP erroneously reported interestexpense by: (1) Not including actual interest expense related to manufacturingin the first quarter of 1988; and (2) offsetting the interest expense withinterest income unrelated to operations.RHP claims that the amount of interest expense reported in its submissionwas correct because interest on debt incurred during the purchase of thecompany by the parent holding company should not be included. Also, theyclaim that the interest income deducted from the expense was related tooperations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The parent company's debt was incurred to acquirethe productive assets of RHP and will be repaid by the income generatedon those assets. Therefore, this interest expense was considered to bepart of the COP. The sources of interest income were reviewed during verificationand it was concluded that all income was related to operations. Net interestexpense incurred during the POI, as a percentage of cost of sales, wasused. <T3>Comment 48. </T3>Petitioner contends that RHP's submission containsmany discrepancies and, therefore, requires the Department to use the highestpossible costs. RHP claims that cost differences in the submission are adverse to RHP andthus believes the submitted costs to be a valid basis for the sales belowcost test. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department examined differences in the costcalculation resulting from the use of different allocation methodologiesfor various parts of the submission. Since, in all cases, those cost differencesreflected higher costs for RHP (<T3>i.e., </T3>they were adverse to RHP) these amounts were accepted bythe Department. <T3>Comment 49. </T3>Petitioner claims that RHP made errors in reportingits corporate Gandamp;A for the submission. RHP claims that the reported Gandamp;A expenses in fact overstated actualcosts. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department verified the Gandamp;A expenses submittedby RHP and we have used them for purposes of the final determination. <T3>Comment 50. </T3>Petitioner claims that the verification report revealsthat SKF-U.K.'s cost system is unreliable based on certain fluctuationsnoted in SKF-U.K.'s quarterly costs. Therefore, the Department should rejectthe submitted cost data in favor of the ``best information available''.SKF-U.K. disagrees, stating that the cost system is fully reliable andthat the submitted quarterly costs should be accepted. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department used a weighted-average of SKF-U.K.'sverified 1987 quarterly costs as ``best information available'' for the1987 costs (10/1-12/31/87). SKF-U.K. had submitted quarterly costs forthe fiscal year 1987 and the first quarter of 1988, which were verified.A measurement period shorter than the annual cycle requires the use ofestimates and accruals to allocate cost among periods, (<T3>i.e., </T3>the quarters), and the Department noted fluctuations whichcould not be explained by specific business conditions among these periodsin 1987. Therefore, the Department concluded that the weighted averageof the costs would more adequately reflect the production costs for theproducts. <T3>Comment 51. </T3>Petitioner states that the SKF-U.K. verification reportsuggests that components and possibly all material costs are presentedat standard in the normal cost accounting system. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department verified that SKF-U.K. reported actualcosts, not standard costs, of components and material for the COP and CVcalculations. <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 17: Romania </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department found severalinstances where quantity and price were subject to change, yet the dateof sale reported by TIE remained the same. Petitioner further contendsthat, as a result of using an incorrect date of sale, the U.S. sales listingis potentially incomplete. Therefore, TIE's U.S. sales data should notbe used for purposes of these final determinations. TIE claims that it has reported all sales made during the POI. It contendsthat the small quantity of shipments made to a single company after itsMost Favored Nation (MFN) status was revoked were made pursuant to a newcontract between the parties and, therefore, took place after the POI.TIE contends that it has properly reported U.S. sales during the POI andthat this information should be used in these final determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>At verification, we found that when Romania's MFNstatus was revoked, shipments pursuant to the original POI contracts ceased.We did discover that a limited number of shipments of AFBs to the UnitedStates did resume later. As the verification report states, after reviewingdocumentation for all of the shipments made after the revocation of MFN,we determined that most of the prices were different than those specifiedin the contracts executed during the POI. Thus, we have determined thatthese shipments were not made pursuant to contracts valid during the POIand, therefore, have not included them in our analysis in these final determinations.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>Petitioner alleges that verification established thatTIE's U.S. sales are incomplete and unreliable. Petitioner asserts thatdue to the large number of discrepancies reported for TIE's volume andvalue of sales, the Department should reject TIE's data base entirely andrely on petitioner's U.S. price data. Petitioner states that in the eventthat the Department does not reject TIE's data entirely, the data's completenessis substantially in doubt. As the Court noted in <T3>Timken </T3>630 F. Supp. at 1338, the lack of a complete data baseis a fundamental defect, undercutting the ability of the Department torely upon those data as substantial evidence. Under these circumstances,petitioner feels that it is appropriate to utilize only the highest marginscalculated for any U.S. sales as the best information regarding TIE's LTFVmargin. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree. Based on verification, we are satisfiedthat TIE has reported all U.S. sales made during the POI. <T3>Comment 3. </T3>Petitioner claims that TIE did not establish any nexusbetween AFBs shipped to the United States and the factors of productiondata provided. Petitioner contends that the data should be rejected asunverified. TIE requests that the Department accept its cross reference list. TIE contendsthat with the supporting affidavits filed by its customers, the Departmenthas an adequate basis for matching sales with factors of production information.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> Based on documentation reviewed, and conversationsheld with company officials at verification, we have determined that thefactors information provided by the Romanian bearing factories correspondsto the product identifiers reported by TIE in its sales listings. Therefore,we have used the cross reference list for purposes of these final determinations.<T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner asserts that by basing net weights on bearingfamily averages contained in incomplete and ``old'' catalogues, TIE reportedinaccurate weights. Petitioner states that there is no indication in theverification report of TIE's attempting, even at that late time, to submitaccurate net weights. Therefore, petitioner contends that these net weightdiscrepancies alone require rejection of TIE's response. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree. At verification, we tested the weightsof several different AFBs at the Brasov and Birlad factories, both by weighingthem and by comparing the weights to the information contained in the factories'production records. At verification, we found one significant discrepancybetween a product's actual and reported weight. However, in reviewing othermanufacturers' product catalogues, we found that this weight was consistentlyoverstated. Therefore, we determined that such an overstatement was indicativeof industry practice and not an indication that the submission was flawed.Thus, we are satisfied that the net weights reported generally reflectthe actual weights of the AFBs and have accepted them for purposes of thesedeterminations.  <T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioner contends that TIE did not respond in a timelyor adequate manner to the Department's questionnaire and various deficiencyletters. Petitioner states that the responses provided by TIE were deficient,filed after significant delays beyond scheduled deadlines and beyond extendeddeadlines granted by the Department, and contained incomplete and inaccurateinformation. Petitioner states that as a result of TIE's tardiness, theDepartment's ability to analyze the response, request additional data,and receive comments and analysis from petitioner prior to the preliminarydeterminations and verification was impaired. Petitioner argues that inthe absence of an adequate or complete response from TIE, the Departmenthas no obligation to develop other information. Due to these circumstances,petitioner contends that in compliance with 19 U.S.C. 1677e(c), the Departmentshould reject TIE's data and rely on best information otherwise available,which may include the information submitted in support of the petitionin reaching its final determinations. TIE states that it has submitted its responses in a timely fashion andthat they were both complete and reliable. Accordingly, TIE argues thatthe Department should base its final determinations upon information ithas submitted. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree with petitioner. Given the complex natureof these investigations, it was necessary for the Department to extendcertain deadlines and allow respondent to supplement responses. TIE hascomplied with the Department's request for information  within the specifieddeadlines and to the extent that the information has been verified, ithas been used for these final determinations.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 18: Miscellaneous </ITAG>A. Database Problems <T3>Comment 1.</T3> Nachi contends that the Department should use Nachi'srevised tape to determine U.S. price because the errors corrected wereminor and the Department found no discrepancy between the revised dataand company documents during verification. Petitioner states that the Department should only use the revised saleslisting if the errors in the original tape resulted from a lack of completeinformation available at the time of response preparation. In addition,information revised at verification but not verified, should be omittedto the extent it decreases FMV or increases U.S. price. Petitioner alsoargues that the number of changes clearly demonstrates that Nachi's responseswere neither accurate nor complete and that post-verification submissionsare unfair to the domestic interested parties as well as unreliable. Forthe above reasons, petitioner urges the Department to reject such datawhich tends to decrease FMV or increase U.S. price. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> For the final determinations we have used Nachi'srevised sales tape which was submitted to the Department on January 23,1989. That sales tape corrected errors which were discovered by Nachi inits preparation for verification. All of the changes and corrections fromthe original tape used by the Department in the preliminary determinationshave been verified. We have determined that the changes made by Nachi,and verified by the Department, were minor corrections and revisions totheir original response.  Thus, we have accepted these corrections andhave taken them into account in the final determinations. It is the Department'spractice to accept and verify minor changes at verification. We find nomerit in petitioner's contention that post-verification submissions inthis case are unfair to domestic interested parties. The minor changesat verification were noted in the verification report. The corrected salestape and response were also submitted to the Department and to petitioner'scounsel four weeks before the public hearing held for these investigations,and five weeks before the final written briefs were requested on theseinvestigations. At no point in this investigation was petitioner deniedthe opportunity to comment on the revisions made to the original response.<T3>Comment 2.</T3> Petitioner contends that NTN's submission of an ``entirelynew computer tape'' on February 15, 1989, was so late as to negate petitioner'sright to comment on factual submissions by opposing parties. The post-verificationchanges in the sales listing are too late to be verified and should notbe permitted. As an example, petitioner cites merchandise processing andharbor maintenance fees which were verified as a percentage of CIF pricesbut which NTN later claimed were based on FOB prices. Petitioner arguesthat, at the least, these items must be rejected. The new data should beused only if deductions from U.S. price are corrected, increased, or restatedfor specific transactions. Changes to home market price should be rejectedbecause they cannot be verified. NTN states that the Department should use the revised computer tapes thatwere submitted on February 15, 1989, in making the final determinations.NTN states that all the data submitted on these tapes has been verifiedby the Department. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with NTN. The tapes submitted by NTN onFebruary 15, 1989, were in response to specific instructions from the Departmentto correct errors found subsequent to the preliminary determinations, orto use information and methodologies specifically requested by the Department.No major changes to the sales data base were permitted. The informationpresented on this tape, which we used for these final determinations, wasverified. Any additional information that NTN chose to include on the salestape that was not requested was disregarded by the Department. Petitioneris incorrect with regard to merchandise processing and harbor maintenancefees, which were verified as NTN has claimed, but were incorrectly statedat one point in the verification report. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> NMB/Pelmec Singapore maintains that the record in thiscase does not support or justify using best information available in thefinal determination. NMB/Pelmec Singapore argues that it submitted thirdcountry information pursuant to the Department's request in a timely fashionand any deficiencies in the data submitted were minor and unintentional.However, it requests that the Department base its final determination onhome market sales data. The home market and third country sales data providedby NMB/Pelmec Singapore establish the viability of the home market. Alternatively,the Department should use constructed value data as the best proxy of thehome market data. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> For the reasons outlined in detail in the MarketViability section of this Appendix, we determined that the Singapore homemarket was not viable and that third country sales serve as the appropriatebasis for foreign market value. Therefore, we have used NMB/Pelmec Singapore'sverified third country sales data for purposes of this determination. <T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioner notes that Rose provided sales informationfrom two databases_one showing sales of products manufactured by Rose andanother showing all sales by Rose, including products made by related companies.Petitioner argues that any adjustments to home market sales must be basedon the latter figure, thus allocating expenses over total home market sales.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> For any home market expense allocated over sales,Rose has allocated these expenses, as petitioner suggests it should, overtotal home market sales, including sales of products made by related companies.We have accepted this allocation methodology for purposes of these determinations.<T3>Comment 5. </T3>At verification the Department found that INA-FRG hadmisclassified certain products. Petitioner argues that the Department shouldask INA-FRG to clarify whether it examined all models that it reportedto ensure that they were properly classified. If INA-FRG did not do this,petitioner contends that the Department should reject INA's response anduse best information otherwise available. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree. As noted in the verification report,prior to the verification in the FRG, the Department requested that INA-FRGreview its sales to ensure that they had been classified correctly. Atverification, INA-FRG informed us that it had found two bearings that ithad reported as cylindrical roller bearings which were actually ball bearings.We reviewed the technical drawings for these bearings to confirm this.We then reviewed the technical drawings for 32 additional bearings whichwe selected at random. We found no discrepancies other than these two minorones identified by INA officials. <T3>Comment 6.</T3> Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Thai incorrectlyreported some sales as ESP transactions when, in fact, they were purchaseprice transactions. NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that it originally reported all U.S. sales asESP transactions because the vast majority were warehoused in the UnitedStates. Respondent contends that since its indirect selling expenses onU.S. sales exceed those on home market sales, NMB/Pelmec Thai has no objectionsto treating such sales as purchase price sales for the final determination.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> As a result of verification, the Department determinedthat certain sales which were shipped directly to an unrelated U.S. customerfrom Thailand were purchase price transactions. Therefore, we have treatedthese sales as such for purposes of the final determination. <T3>Comment 7.</T3> Petitioner submits that SKF-France incorrectly includedsales to trading companies as home market sales. These sales should notbe included in the home market database, because SKF-France is aware thatthese products will be exported. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree, and have deleted these sales from thehome market sales listing since SKF-France knew at the time of the saleto the trading companies that the bearings were destined for export markets.<T3>Comment 8.</T3> Petitioner asserts that the statute does not permitthe Department to determine whether SKF-Sweden's home market is viableby relying on sales of merchandise produced in a country other than thecountry of exportation. Furthermore, even assuming that imported bearingscould be added to Swedish-produced bearings as a basis for FMV, this approachwould not be appropriate without first ensuring that the imported bearingswere themselves not dumped and sold below the cost of production. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The only class or kind of merchandise in Swedenfor which we are examining home market sales is cylindrical roller bearings.As discussed in the Department's verification report of December 23, 1988,no support production was provided for sales of cylindrical roller bearingsin the home market during the POI. Therefore, the concerns raised by petitionerare not relevant to this investigation.<T3>Comment 9. </T3>Petitioner claims that the Department should make clearthat spherical roller bearings shipped by SKF-Italy to the United Statesare subject to any antidumping duty order on that product and assign thehighest estimated duty rate for any respondent. Although the verificationreport states that SKF-Italy produces this product, SKF-Italy reportedthat it had no sales of spherical roller bearings to the United Statesduring the period of investigation. As in the prior cases of the <T3>Final Determinations of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Hungary and Romania,</T3>52 FR 17428, 52 FR 17433 (May 8, 1987), the Department should haveextended the period of investigation to capture earlier sales. SKF-Italy claims that it had no exports of spherical roller bearings tothe United States during the POI and that the Department verified thisfact. Unlike the cases cited by petitioner, the Department did not decideto extend the period of investigation for SKF-Italy's spherical rollerbearings. Therefore, the appropriate margin, if anything, must be zero.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>The Department is satisfied that SKF-Italy did notexport spherical roller bearings to the United States during the periodof investigation. If it begins to ship this product in the future, anyentries will be subject to the ``All Other'' rate for spherical rollerbearings from Italy. The Department did not extend the period of investigation for SKF-Italy'sspherical roller bearings because, unlike the cases cited by petitionerwhere there was a single respondent, we have the necessary informationin this investigation to calculate an ``All Other'' rate for this product.<T3>Comment 10. </T3>Rose contends that the Department failed to examineat least 60 percent of the dollar volume of plain bearing exports to theUnited States, as required by andSection; 353.38(a) of the Department's regulations.Therefore, the Department should terminate the investigation of plain bearingsfrom the United Kingdom because Rose's exports were less than one percentof the total dollar volume of plain bearing exports to the United Statesduring the period of investigation. As such, Rose's exports do not providea fair representation of U.K. sales of plain bearings to the United States.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>Based on the information available to us at thetime the questionnaire was issued, we believed that Rose was a major exporterof spherical plain bearings from the United Kingdom to the United States.To date we have not seen any conclusive evidence to indicate that thisis not true, especially in light of our determination to exclude journalbearings (plain bushings) from the scope of these investigations. See thescope discussion in this Appendix. Furthermore, we note that andSection;353.38(a) states that we will <T3>normally </T3>look at 60 percent coverage; it does not require thiscoverage. <T3>Comment 11. </T3>Petitioner contends that the Department should correctSNR's denominator for allocating selling expenses by using the higher ofthe two reported total U.S. sales amounts for purposes of the final determinations.<T3>DOC Position. </T3>We disagree. It was found at verification that thehigher figure reported by SNR was inclusive of some Canadian sales, aswell as sales made in the month preceding the period of investigation.Based on the results of verification, we have used the U.S. sales figurethat was initially reported. B. Hedging/Exchange Rates <T3>Comment 12. </T3>FAG-FRG and FAG-Italy argue that the Department shouldgrant a circumstance of sale adjustment to reflect the difference betweenFAG's actual return on its U.S. sales and the theoretical return that resultsfrom using the Federal Reserve exchange rate on the date of sale. SinceFAG conducted forward hedging operations to fix its Deutsche mark and lirareturn for each of its U.S. sales during the period of investigation, theFederal Reserve rate does not accurately reflect the appropriate conversionof foreign market values into U.S. dollars. Petitioner argues that the Department should not make this circumstanceof sale adjustment. The regulations are very clear that the Departmentis to rely on the Federal Reserve quarterly rates unless there is a fivepercent daily variance or when the dumping margins are the result solelyof exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the statute makes no provisionunder circumstance of sale adjustments for the type of adjustment thatFAG wants to claim. To allow a circumstance of sale adjustment to reflecthedging would be the equivalent of allowing the respondent to set its ownexchange rate, thus rendering the law and regulations concerning exchangerates meaningless. Petitioner notes that the Department has held that expenses related tohedging are not sales related, as in the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Brass Sheet andStrip from Italy, </T3>52 FR 816 (January 9, 1987). In these investigationsFAG has not demonstrated that the expenses it is claiming are directlyrelated to sales. Even if FAG were to have no U.S. sales, it would stillhave to supply the dollars needed for its forward contract. Therefore,profits from hedging are independent of U.S. sales. In fact, FAG recordedincome from currency conversion under ``Other Income'' in its 1987 AnnualReport. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>This adjustment is not related to fluctuating exchangerates, contrary to petitioner's argument. In the very specific factualpattern presented in this case, we found that it was appropriate to makea circumstance of sale adjustment to reflect hedging profits or lossesaccurately, where these profits or losses were properly documented andverified. Therefore, we have allowed the adjustment for hedging for FAG's1987 sales but not for its 1988 sales. To demonstrate that hedging has affected the actual exchange rate thatit has received for its sales, a respondent must show the Department theactual exchange contracts that it entered into and demonstrate that thesecontracts are tied directly to the sales that took place during the periodof investigation. In addition, the respondent must then accurately reportthe exchange rate that it received on these sales and include this informationin its listing of individual sales and adjustments. In these investigations FAG reported that it used the forward market toensure a certain exchange rate for each of its U.S. sales. At verification,it provided examples of its forward contracts and demonstrated that ithad exchanged dollars received from its sales in the United States at therates in those contracts. The rates FAG realized on its sales differedsubstantially from the Federal Reserve rates. When we examined FAG's listings of U.S. sales and the adjustment it gaveto reflect the actual exchange rates it received on these sales, we foundthat it based these adjustments for 1987 on the average of the actual exchangerates it received through its forward contracts in 1987. However, for 1988FAG based these adjustments on its ``budgeted'' rate for 1988, <T3>i.e., </T3>a rate representing the average exchange rate that the companyhad forecast it would receive for sales in that year. Therefore, the claimed1988 adjustment was not based on the company's actual foreign exchangeearnings in that year. <T3>See </T3>the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain ForgedSteel Crankshafts from the United Kingdom, </T3>52 FR 32951 (Septemberl, 1987). In Crankshafts, as in the 1988 U.S. sales in the instant case,the respondent did not provide enough evidence to support its assertionthat its pricing is directly linked to, or based on, the actual exchangerate it received. In order to make an adjustment of this sort, the Department must rely onthe actual rates that a company receives. Forecasted rates, especiallythose that provide only one rate for an entire year, remain only estimatesof what a company expects to receive in its foreign exchange dealings.This information is too speculative to be used in our calculations. Therefore,the Department has not allowed FAG's claim for a circumstance of sale adjustmentto reflect its hedging operations in 1988. Although the Department wouldprefer a more precise measure of the actual rate a company realized, <T3>e.g., </T3>a rate based on a monthly average or one tied directly tothe forward contracts for each U.S. sale, it verified the accuracy of FAG's1987 data and allowed a hedging adjustment based on the average actualexchange rate it realized on sales in that year. As petitioner notes, the antidumping regulations clearly state that theDepartment is to rely on the Federal Reserve rates to convert foreign currenciesto U.S. dollars (19 CFR 353.56(a)). We agree and have used the FederalReserve rates for our calculations for FAG. However, because FAG clearlydemonstrated for its 1987 sales that, through the use of forward markets,it received more money for its U.S. sales than our calculations would normallyindicate, it is appropriate for the Department to take this action intoaccount. Forward markets are clearly a tool that businesses can use toinsure the actual return they receive on their sales. Where the use ofthese markets can be tied directly to sales, it does not make sense toignore them. We note that the investigation of Italian brass sheet and strip dealt withhedging expenses related to the purchase of imported raw materials usedto make the product under investigation. Those expenses were clearly notdirect selling expenses. However, the hedging operations examined in theseinvestigations are tied directly to FAG's U.S. sales. Finally, in regardto petitioner's allegation that FAG would have had to supply dollars forits forward contracts even if it did not have any U.S. sales, we note thatif FAG had no U.S. sales it is unlikely to have entered into any such forwardcontracts. <T3>Comment 13. </T3>INA-FRG argues that the Department should apply the90-day lag rule for the second half of the period of investigation to avoidthe effects of an over 16 percent increase in the value of the Deutschemark against the U.S. dollar. INA-FRG argues that the Department shouldutilize the quarterly rate for the fourth quarter of 1987 for the entireperiod of investigation for purposes of converting Deutsche marks to U.S.dollars. INA-FRG states that in <T3>Melamine Chemical v. </T3><T3>United States, </T3>732 F.2d 924 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the Court of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit held that it was within the intent of Congressand within the Department's authority to apply the 90-day lag rule to avoidartificial margins created by temporary fluctuations in currency exchangerates.Petitioner asserts that the Deutsche mark was not volatile during the periodof investigation. Petitioner explains that the mark never rose more than15 percent during the period of investigation and that the rise was gradual.Also, the exchange rate for the fourth quarter of 1987 was essentiallythe same as those for the preceding three quarters (DM 1.847/$ versus 1.91,1.82 and 1.847, respectively). Petitioner argues that INA-FRG was unableto satisfy the two conditions for invoking the 90-day lag rule: (1) Theexchange rates are subject to temporary fluctuations, and (2) that therespondent show that it took actions within a reasonable amount of timeto adjust its prices for changes in exchange rates. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with petitioner. Section 353.56(b) statesthat manufacturers, exporters and importers will be expected to act withina reasonable period of time to take into account price differences resultingfrom sustained changes in prevailing exchange rates. Because INA-FRG didnot demonstrate that it had adjusted its prices to respond to exchangerate changes within a reasonable period of time, we denied its request.C. Level of Trade <T3>Comment 14. </T3>NTN states that it sells bearings to two distinctclasses of customers, OEMs and distributors. As such, when the Departmentmakes comparisons between the different levels of trade, an adjustmentshould be made, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.19. NTN states that a level of tradeadjustment was accepted in the final determination of <T3>Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished,from Japan </T3>(52 FR 30700, August 17, 1987). NTN states that the differencein selling expenses between OEMs and distributors is quantified in itssection B questionnaire response. Petitioner contends that NTN bears theburden of demonstrating an entitlement to a level of trade adjustment.It states that NTN did make a request for this adjustment but that NTNdid not provide substantive data which would have demonstrated any actualdifference in the selling expenses that are incurred at the OEM level andat the distributor level in either market.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> Where there are comparable sales in both marketsat the same level of trade, we have made comparisons at the same levelof trade. Where there are no comparable sales at the same level of trade,we have made comparisons without adjusting prices to account for any levelof trade differences. In this respect, we agree with petitioner. At nopoint did NTN supply the Department with a quantifiable adjustment to beverified. NTN has alluded to information supplied with the questionnaireresponse that can be used to make the adjustment. However, it is not theresponsibility of the Department to determine and quantify an adjustmentwhen the respondent has not even attempted to prove that an adjustmentis warranted. <T3>Comment 15.</T3> NSK claims that sales made to distributors who sellto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) should be treated as being atthe same level of trade as direct sales to OEMs. Petitioner contends thatNSK failed to provide evidence that it incurs the same selling expensesin selling directly to OEMs and to OEMs through distributors. For thisreason it contends that the Department should reject NSK's claim. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree with NSK. The statute requires the Departmentto make comparisons based on sales to the first unrelated customer. Thedistributor in these cases is the first unrelated customer and who thecustomer's customer may be is not relevant to our analysis. Furthermore,NSK has not demonstrated that the selling expenses incurred in these distributorsales are comparable to those for direct OEM sales. <T3>Comment 16.</T3> Petitioner claims that according to the Department'sverification report, SNR has classified sales to small OEMs as sales todistributors. As a result, sales to OEMs in one market could be comparedto distributor sales in the other market, significantly affecting the analysis.Moreover, this misclassification can affect the allocation of certain sellingexpenses. Unless comparisons are made at the proper level of trade andexpenses have been allocated correctly, petitioner claims that the Departmentshould use best information available. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> In its response, SNR stated that sales to smallOEMs in the home market were treated as distributor sales because the smallOEMs, like distributors, purchase in small quantities. Moreover, SNR claimedthat small OEM and distributor sales are handled by another sales department.Thus, the selling expenses incurred for small OEM sales are the same asthose for distributor sales. The Department has reviewed SNR's home market sales listing and has concludedthat sales labelled as distributor sales are generally low in volume relativeto sales labelled as OEM sales. Therefore, in terms of quantities sold,sales to small OEMs were comparable to distributor sales, as SNR claims,and we have accepted its classification of these sales. Moreover, giventhat we are treating these sales to small OEMs as distributor sales, wehave also accepted SNR's allocation of selling expenses between distributorand OEM sales as reasonable.  D. Military Sales/Government Procurement Sales <T3>Comment 17.</T3> Rose, FAG-FRG, and FAG-Italy argue that the Departmentverified that certain of their U.S. sales were intended for U.S. militaryuse and were imported under Schedule 8 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA).</T3> Thesesales should be excluded from our calculations and should be accorded duty-freetreatment. FAG-Italy further contends that its sales of spherical rollerbearings which it initially reported as U.S. Government procurement saleswere in fact not U.S. Government transactions, and, therefore, they shouldbe included in the Department's calculations for purposes of these finaldeterminations. Petitioner argues that the Department should use best information availableto calculate the company-specific rate for FAG-Italy's spherical rollerbearings, because these sales have a ``substantial non-military'' use.As such, these sales should not be exempt from antidumping duties. It alsoargues that bearings shipped to the U.S. Government for military purposesfrom FAG-FRG should also be included in that company's U.S. sales listing.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> With regard to Rose Bearings, FAG-FRG, and certainsales of FAG-Italy, the Department verified that these sales were indeedmilitary sales and entered the United States under Schedule 8 of the <T3>TSUSA</T3> and were made prior to the enactment of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act). As such, they will notbe subject to any antidumping duties. <T3>See,</T3> e.g., <T3>Titanium Sponge from Japan,</T3> 49 FR 38687 (1984). Therefore, theseschedule 8 sales have been excluded from our calculations. However, the1988 Act changed the law with respect to Schedule 8 importations. Section1335 of the 1988 Act provides that merchandise imported under Schedule8 will be subject to duties unless it meets certain specific exceptions.Hence, Schedule 8 sales of bearings to the U.S. Government after the dateof the preliminary determination may be subject to duties. We will onlybe able to determine whether these sales meet the Section 1335 exceptionsin the context of an administrative review, if any. Therefore, we willinstruct Customs to suspend liquidation of Schedule 8 bearings at a zerorate. Verification also revealed, however, that FAG-Italy's sales of sphericalroller bearings were not U.S. Government procurement sales made pursuantto Schedule 8 and, hence, they are subject to antidumping duties. Accordingly,we used these sales to calculate company-specific United States price.E. Obsolete Sales/Sample Sales <T3>Comment 18.</T3> Petitioner argues that certain sales of obsolete ordiscontinued bearings reported by FAG-Italy and FAG-FRG should be includedin the Department's calculations for the final determinations since suchbearings, albeit obsolete or discontinued, can be dumped. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> FAG-USA made no attempt at verification to supporttheir claim that certain bearings reported as obsolete were in fact obsoletebearings and, therefore, should not be included in the Department's calculations.Furthermore, we were able to find identical matches in the home marketfor these bearings. We have no information on the record to support excludingthese bearings from our analysis. Therefore, we have included these salesof such bearings in our final calculations. <T3>Comment 19.</T3> SKF-France contends that of the six U.S. productsmistakenly identified as obsolete, only one has an identical match in thehome market. In addition, it explains that, because this one product representsa small quantity of sales in the United States, it has not been includedon SKF-France's U.S. sales listing. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> During the verification of SKF-USA, we found thatall six products had in fact been sold in the United States during theperiod of investigation. However, because the quantity of these unreportedU.S. sales is so small relative to the overall U.S. sales listing, we havenot adjusted SKF-France's margin to reflect these unreported sales. <T3>Comment 20.</T3> Petitioner contends that FAG-FRG failed to includesample and replacement bearings in its U.S. sales listings. Accordingly,all free samples or promotional giveaways and replacement bearings claimedby FAG-FRG should be included in its U.S. sales listing. Furthermore, thesamples or giveaways should be included at a zero price. FAG-FRG asserts that the Department excluded sales of sample and replacementbearings for purposes of the preliminary determinations. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with FAG-FRG. As in our preliminary determinations,we have excluded from our final calculations samples and replacement bearings,as these products comprise an inconsequential number of bearings sold inthe United States.F. Ordinary Course of Trade and Usual Commercial Quantities <T3>Comment 21.</T3> NTN states that the Department should use only thosesales made in the ordinary course of trade and in usual commercial quantitieswhen determining foreign market value. Petitioner argues that NTN's homemarket sales listing is incomplete because sales termed ``trial'' sales,``cancellations'' of previous sales, or sales of ``very small quantities''were not included in the listing of comparison sales. The Department shouldnot permit exclusion of these sales from the comparison listing. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We verified that the excluded sales constitutedcancellations, customer credit adjustments, and trial or sample sales,the latter being outside the ordinary course of trade. As such, we agreewith the respondent that such transactions are properly excluded from thecomparison data base. <T3>Comment 22.</T3> INA-FRG argues that the Department should excludefrom its calculations certain home market sales which it alleges were notmade in the ordinary course of trade or usual commercial quantities. Thesales in question are sales of inch-size bearings, which INA-FRG contendsshould be excluded because inch-size bearings do not appear in catalogsand price lists in the home market and no discounts are offered on salesof them. INA-FRG cites the decision in <T3>Monsanto Co. </T3>v.<T3> United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-137 (C.I.T. Oct 14, l988), and the<T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Porcelain-on-SteelCooking Ware from Mexico, </T3>51 FR 36435 (October 10, 1986), to supportits position. Finally, INA-FRG contends that sales of inch-size bearings in the homemarket are not in the usual commercial quantities, citing two examplesof sales which involved very small quantities. INA-FRG also states thatthe principal reason these sales should be excluded is because the Departmentconcluded at the preliminary determinations that they were at a differentlevel of trade and because these sales comprised less than two percentof the total volume of sales. Petitioner argues that INA-FRG's argument is unsupported. Petitioner contendsthat INA-FRG has not shown that sales of such bearings in its home marketare not regular, <T3>i.e., </T3>that there are no customers who regularly purchase suchbearings, even if only in small quantities. Petitioner cites the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Brass Sheet andStrip from Japan, </T3>53 FR 23298 (June 21, 1988), where the Departmentdid not exclude from foreign market value small quantity sales where suchsales were to the sellers usual commercial customers and where such customerswere at the same level of trade as the U.S. purchasers of the product.Further, petitioner contends that the fact that these bearings are notlisted in INA-FRG's catalogue, or that discounts are not provided on suchsales, does not establish that they are not in the ordinary course of trade.Petitioner states that its experience has been that practically all bearingproducers make some products that they do not carry in a particular catalogue,but that are consistently offered for sale and are sold to customers. Petitionerasserts that the Department should reject INA-FRG's argument and base foreignmarket value on all sales of identical merchandise in INA-FRG's home market.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> We agree with petitioner. The Department's treatmentof INA-FRG's inch-sized bearings is consistent with the treatment accordedto a number of respondents in these investigations who reported sales ofinch-sized bearings. In its arguments INA-FRG was not able to distinguishits sales of such products from those of other companies that have notclaimed that inch-sized bearings are outside the ordinary course of trade.The inch versus metric issue was raised in earlier bearings cases, as inthe <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan, </T3>52FR 30700 (August 17, 1987). In that case the Department determined thatinch-sized bearings were within the ordinary course of trade and made comparisonsto the identical or most similar product within the such or similar category,regardless of the quantity sold. Relative to our position regarding thecorrelation between total quantities sold in the respective markets, seethe comment on INA-FRG in the ``Viability'' section of this Appendix. Forthese reasons, and because INA-FRG was not persuasive in distinguishingits inch-size bearing sales from those of other companies, we have includedthese products in our comparisons for purposes of the final determinations. <T3>Comment 23.</T3> Petitioner contends that while FAG-FRG requests differenttreatment for sales of bearings with very small quantities of identicalmerchandise in the home market when compared to those of very large quantitiesin the U.S. market, FAG-FRG does not request similar consideration be givenwhere very small quantities of U.S. sales are being compared to large quantitiesof home market sales. Petitioner states that given the likelihood of sucha reverse situation, the only fair way for the Department to make the proposedadjustment would be to apply the same standard to both markets. However,petitioner argues that for purposes of the final determinations, salesof the contested merchandise should be used in making fair value comparisonsand that the Department should continue to base its analysis on sales madeat the same level of trade. FAG-FRG contends that with as little as 33 percent of total U.S. salesbeing used for a determination of sales at less than fair value and a lackof similar merchandise alternatives when the identical threshold is met,it is essential to avoid price comparisons based on sales of very smallquantities of identical merchandise in the home market to those of verylarge quantities in the U.S. market. They argue that 19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)(1)(A) and (B) require the Department to base foreign market value on salesvolumes that provide an adequate basis for price comparisons. FAG-FRG submitsthat where sales of such bearings in the home market are limited so asnot to provide an adequate basis for comparison to sales in the UnitedStates, the Department should either base its fair value comparison onconstructed value or simply exclude those bearings from its product comparisons.<T3>DOC Position.</T3> Under andSection; 353.14 of our regulations, we willnormally compare sales of comparable quantities. Thus, if there are largeand small quantity sales in the home market and only large quantity salesin the United States, we will not include the small quantity home marketsales in the calculation of foreign market value. In the instances referredto by FAG-FRG, we have no such large quantity sales in the home market.Moreover, FAG-FRG has not argued that its small quantity home market salesare out of the ordinary course of trade or not in the usual commercialquantities. Therefore, we have used these sales in our final determinations.G. Rescissions <T3>Comment 24.</T3> Petitioner contends that, even assuming five classesor kinds of merchandise exist, the Department erred in rescinding the investigationsof cylindrical roller bearings, needle roller bearings, spherical rollerbearings, and spherical plain bearings from Singapore and Thailand. Itcontends that the information it provided on ball bearings qualifies asreasonably available information and was sufficient to initiate an investigationof these other bearing types. Petitioner further argues that the Department'srescissions increase the potential for respondent multinational corporationsto shift products and markets so as to circumvent the Department's antidumpingorders. Petitioner contends that the Department's rescissions of the cylindricalroller, needle roller, and plain bearings from Romania investigations wereunlawful. <T3>DOC Position.</T3>  On July 13, 1988, the Department determined thatthe subject merchandise constitutes five separate classes or kinds of merchandise(<T3>see </T3>the discussion in the ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' sectionof this Appendix). In light of that decision, the Department reexaminedthe sufficiency of petitioner's LTFV allegations for each class or kindof merchandise for each country cited in the petition. With respect to Singapore and Thailand, the only pricing data that petitionerprovided for foreign market value was for ball bearings and petitionerdid not provide <T3>any </T3>U.S. price data with respect to cylindrical roller bearings,needle roller bearings, spherical roller bearings, and spherical plainbearings. For Romania, the only allegations and supporting data providedby petitioner was with respect to ball and spherical roller bearings. Byletters dated July 11 and August 22, 1988, the Department informed petitionerthat the petition lacked support for the LTFV allegations with respectto certain classes or kinds of merchandise. The Department gave petitioneran opportunity to provide additional information in support of its LTFVallegations. However, upon petitioner's failure to provide the requesteddocumentation, the Department rescinded those investigations where suchsupporting data was not provided since the Department had no evidence thatthose classes or kinds of merchandise were being sold at less than fairvalue and could not continue such investigations based on petitioner'sspeculation that the alleged LTFV sales of one class or kind provides asufficient basis to believe or suspect that sales of other classes or kindsof merchandise are being made at LTFV. <T3>See, Partial Rescission of Initiation of Antidumping Investigationsand Dismissal of Petitions; Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered RollerBearings) and Parts Thereof from Romania, Singapore, and Thailand </T3>(53FR 39327, 39328, October 6, 1988).Given the above, the Department finds no reason to alter its earlier rescissiondecisions since petitioner has failed to provide adequate allegations andsupporting evidence reasonably available to it to warrant the continuedinvestigations of that merchandise. With respect to petitioner's concern regarding the potential for a multinationalcorporation to shift products and markets in order to circumvent an antidumpingorder, see the discussion in the Class or Kind of Merchandise section ofthis Appendix. H. Related vs. Unrelated Sales <T3>Comment 25. </T3>NSK contends that it is not responsible for salesmade by two related companies, as it does not have a controlling interestin either. Consequently, the Department should treat NSK as separate fromthese other manufacturers for purposes of the final determinations. Petitioner states that two subsidiaries of NSK sold NSK-manufactured bearingsin the United States and home market during the period of investigationand argues that the Department should use the prices at which the relatedparties resell the merchandise to establish foreign market value, underandSection;353.22 of the Department's regulations. Petitioner further contendsthat it is Departmental practice to require the consolidation of relatedmanufacturing companies in the filing of responses and that the Departmenthas even treated related but separate manufacturing companies in differentcountries as one respondent, as in the <T3>Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Ball Bearingsand Parts Thereof from Singapore, </T3>53 FR 45339 (November 9, 1988). <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We have not collapsed the two related firms withNSK for the purpose of requiring a consolidated response in these investigations.It is the Department's general practice <T3>not </T3>to collapse related parties except in certain relatively unusualsituations, where the type and degree of relationship is so significantthat we find there is a strong possibility of price manipulation. <T3>See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Brass Sheetand Strip from France, </T3>52 FR 812, 814 (January 9, 1987); <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain GraniteProducts from Spain, </T3>53 FR 24335, 24337 (June 28, 1988); <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain GraniteProducts from Italy, </T3>53 FR 27187, 27189 (July 19, 1988). The Departmenthas refused to collapse firms in situations where the facts suggest thatsuch a possibility does not exist. <T3>See Hot Rolled Carbon Steel Plate and Sheet from Brazil, </T3>49 FR3102 (January 25, 1984). In this case, NSK's shares of ownership in the related firms are substantiallylower than those in the cases where we have collapsed related parties.The firms do not share marketing information or production decisions, noris there an intertwined management structure such as was present in othercases. For these reasons, we find that there does not appear to be a substantialdanger of price manipulation as a result of the relationship of NSK withthe two related firms. In the <T3>Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Ball Bearingsand Parts Thereof from Singapore, </T3>53 FR 45339 (November 9, 1988),we consolidated two manufacturing companies, both of which are locatedin Singapore, because they are sister companies, wholly owned by the sameparent company. Thus, the pricing decisions at both companies are controlledby the same entity. <T3>Comment 26. </T3>NMB/Pelmec Thai argues that where sales of such orsimilar merchandise to unrelated parties do not exist, the Department shouldproperly consider other evidence, such as NMB/Pelmec Thai's recovery ofall costs on its sales to related parties, as indicated in its response,to determine whether related party sales were at arm's length. Further,citing the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Paint Filtersand Strainers from Brazil, </T3>52 FR 19181 (May 21, 1987), respondentcontends that the Department has based its determination of the arm's-lengthnature of prices on costs and profitability. Petitioner contends that NMB/Pelmec Thai provided no evidence showing thearm's length nature of the sales to related parties. With respect to NMB/PelmecThai's argument that the sales to related parties were at prices sufficientto cover all costs, petitioner argues that above cost sales are not necessarilyarm's length sales. Petitioner also argues that the <T3>Paint Filters </T3>case is not applicable to the facts in this investigationbecause the issue in that case was whether prices paid to related supplierswere at arm's length. The Department found that prices were based on theprofitability of the supplier. However, petitioner maintains that the supplierperformed work only for the company under investigation so that its profitabilitywas determined solely by the related party sales. Petitioner further assertsthat NMB/Pelmec Thai does not sell only to related parties; therefore,respondent's argument that the sales to related parties were at pricessufficient to cover costs is not relevant. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We agree with petitioner. The only way the respondentcould have demonstrated that these sales are at arm's length is by comparingthe prices to related parties to sales of the same merchandise to unrelatedparties. NMB/Pelmec was not able to do so, because no such sales to unrelatedparties existed. The Department does not examine recovery costs to determinewhether or not prices are at arm's length under 19 CFR 353.22(b). However,because we have determined that the Thai home market is not viable, wehave not used the home market sales as the basis for foreign market value.Therefore, this issue is moot. <T3>Comment 27. </T3>Petitioner argues that home market sales of INA-France'ssubsidiary should not be considered because the Department did not verifythese sales. INA-France contends that the Department in its preliminarydeterminations erroneously disregarded the home market sales of its wholly-ownedsubsidiary, Societe Mechanique du Nord d'Alsace (Noral). INA-France arguesthat the Department should accept the data regarding these sales and usethe data for the final determinations. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>This issue is moot, as the sales in question wereof linear motion bearings, which have been excluded from the scope of theseinvestigations. This is discussed in greater detail in the Scope Issuessection of this Appendix. <T3>Comment 28. </T3>Nachi, NSK, and NTN contend that in calculating foreignmarket value for purposes of the final determinations, the Department shouldinclude their sales to related parties. Each of the respondents state thatsales to related distributors are comparable to sales to unrelated distributors;thus, they have satisfied the requirements of 19 CFR 353.22(b). NTN furthercontends that 19 CFR 353.22(b) does not require that all prices to relatedparties be greater or equal to prices charged to unrelated parties, butonly requires that they be ``comparable''. Petitioner argues that the Departmentshould disregard those respondents' related party sales because they havenot demonstrated that prices charged to related parties were equivalentto arm's length prices under 19 U.S.C. 1677b(e)(2). <T3>DOC Position. </T3>In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(b), the Departmentdoes not use prices to related parties unless it is shown that such pricesare ``comparable'' to prices to unrelated parties. Under andSection;353.22(b),the respondent must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department thatthe prices of such or similar merchandise between related and unrelatedparties are comparable. The burden of proof is on the respondent to showthat the prices are comparable since that is the party making the claim.For the Department to consider using related party sales, a respondentmust provide a detailed analysis of the prices charged to related partiesand those to unrelated parties on identical products. If based on thisevidence, it appears that the prices may be comparable, we will do ourown analysis on all of respondent's sales. We will generally compare netprices charged to related and unrelated parties. These prices are net ofdiscounts, rebates, commissions, and credit expenses. We then compare thosenet prices on a product-by-product basis to determine whether sales torelated parties are made at prices comparable to unrelated party sales.Depending on the circumstances of the investigation, other expenses mayalso be deducted from the prices before we make our price comparisons.For example, if a company pays inland freight only on certain sales, wewill deduct inland freight from the sale to calculate a net price. If a respondent has not provided sale- or customer-specific payment periodsfor the calculation of credit expenses, or if the respondent has allocatedcommissions, rebates, or discounts rather than reporting them on a sale-specificbasis, no analysis on price comparability can be done. For NSK, we foundthis to be the case. Therefore, we have not used NSK's related party salesin the final determinations since no analysis could be done to demonstratethat such sales were comparable to sales to unrelated parties. Furthermore,the information on the record in these investigations shows that distributorsrelated to NSK benefit from more favorable credit terms and are offeredcertain rebate and discount programs not available to unrelated customers.Nachi and NTN both provided an analysis to the Department on the pricescharged to related and unrelated parties on a product-specific basis. Nachiprovided the analysis on October 24, 1988, and NTN provided its analysisduring verification. After review of these submissions, we determined thatour own analysis was warranted since it appeared that prices between relatedand unrelated parties for both Nachi and NTN may be comparable.Our analysis of the prices charged on related and unrelated party salesdid not demonstrate to our satisfaction that prices on all sales are comparable.We agree with NTN that andSection; 353.22(b) does not require that all relatedparty sales be greater or equal to the prices charged to unrelated parties.However, our analysis shows that for many products there are significantprice differentials on an identical product sold to related and unrelatedparties. In such instances, the significantly lower price charged to arelated party could not be demonstrated to be the result of factors otherthan relationship, such as differences in quantity purchased. We note,once again, that the burden is on the respondent to demonstrate to thesatisfaction of the Department that such prices are comparable. Therefore,we are not using related party sales in our calculation of foreign marketvalue in these determinations for either Nachi or NTN. <T3>Comment 29.</T3> Petitioner states that the Department should excludeall sales made by Nachi to Toyota from the home market database becauseToyota owns 6.05 percent of Nachi and thus constitutes a related party.Furthermore, petitioner states that there is nothing on the record to demonstratethat sales to Toyota are made at prices equivalent to those charged tounrelated parties. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We disagree. Sales to Toyota are made through anunrelated trading company. Therefore, we consider such sales to be unrelatedsales. <T3>Comment 30.</T3> Several Japanese manufacturers of automobiles, suchas Toyota and Nissan, argue that antifriction bearings which they exportto their U.S. subsidiaries for incorporation into automobiles or automobileparts before being sold to the first unrelated party should be excludedfrom the suspension of liquidation. Citing <T3>Roller Chain, Other Than Bicycle, from Japan; Final Results of AdministrativeReview of Antidumping Finding,</T3> 48 FR 51801 (November 14, 1983), theyhave requested that we exclude such imports at the investigation stage,rather than require bonds or cash deposits which ultimately would be refundedin an administrative review of any eventual order. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> In <T3>Roller Chain,</T3> a Japanese motorcycle manufacturer (Honda) purchasedroller chain in Japan for subsequent exportation to its U.S. subsidiary,Honda of America. Since Honda, and not the Japanese roller chain manufacturer,was determined to be the exporter, the Department looked first to Honda'ssales to establish a U.S. price. However, because Honda of America wasincorporating the imported roller chain into motorcycles, the first saleto an unrelated party in the United States was of a finished motorcycle.In such situations, where further manufacture is performed by a relatedparty in the United States, the Department's normal practice would be tocalculate the ESP price by backing out the additional cost of the finishedproduct, leaving only that which is representative of the product underinvestigation (<T3>see</T3> 19 CFR 353.10(e)(3)). In <T3>Roller Chain,</T3> however, the Department concluded that it was appropriateto follow this practice only when the quantity or value of the importedproduct was more than an ``insignificant'' amount of the finished product.Since this was determined not to be the case with respect to roller chainand motorcycles, no final assessment was made on the transactions betweenHonda and its U.S. subsidiary. The Department acknowledges that the principle underlying our decisionin <T3>Roller Chain</T3> would logically apply with equal force to bearingsincorporated into automobiles. Indeed, the Japanese automobile manufacturershave stated that the value of bearings is less than one percent of thecost of a finished automobile. While it is not clear what percentage ofa particular automobile part or subassembly would be attributable to thevalue of bearings, it is possible that that percentage would also be considered``insignificant.'' In light of the above, the Department has given careful consideration tothe feasibility of exempting those bearings being imported by related partiesfor incorporation into automobiles from any suspension of liquidation requirements.However, in evaluating possible options, we have found several importantdistinctions between the facts and circumstances of the <T3>Roller Chain</T3> decision and those which we face in the antifrictionbearings investigations. First, in <T3>Roller Chain,</T3> there was no initial question akin to the one weface here of whether the imports should be somehow exempted from the suspensionof liquidation. Second, all of the imports at issue were exported by Hondaexclusively to its U.S. subsidiary, which incorporated the roller chaininto motorcycles in a Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ). Thus, the circumstancesof <T3>Roller Chain</T3>_a single exporter, a single importer, and entriesbeing made into an FTZ_were such that surveillance on the part of the U.S.Customs Service and the Department was administratively feasible. By contrast, in the instant investigations, the facts and circumstancesare much more complex and less predictable. The Japanese automobile manufacturersexport bearings to their U.S. subsidiaries for two purposes: (1) To incorporatethe bearings into automobiles and (2) to resell the bearings to unrelatedparties in the after-market for replacement purposes. However, Toyota <T3>et al.,</T3> have not convincingly explained how either the Departmentor U.S. Customs could successfully differentiate the ultimate end-use ofeach of the imported bearings as they enter the United States. Comparedto <T3>Roller Chain,</T3> the number of exporters and importers in these investigationsis far more numerous, some importations would be into FTZs while some wouldnot, and there conceivably would be an indefinite variety of downstreamproducts into which imported bearings would be incorporated by relatedparties. Under such varied circumstances, it would be virtually impossiblefor either the Department or U.S. Customs to establish an effective methodof ensuring that the ``correct'' bearing imports were being exempted fromthe suspension of liquidation requirements. The Department's past experiencewith end-use certification procedures has shown that effective monitoringis difficult enough when the circumstances are far less complicated thanexist here. Therefore, given the Department's overarching mandate to ensure the properenforcement of the antidumping duty law, we have concluded that there isno practicable way of meeting the Japanese automobile manufacturers' requestwithout jeopardizing the integrity of any antidumping duty orders. We thereforeare denying their request for exemption from suspension of liquidationrequirements. In accordance with the statutory scheme, the manufacturerswill have the opportunity to obtain refunds of cash deposits, as appropriate,during any subsequent administrative review under section 751 of the Act.I. Separate ESP/PP Rates <T3>Comment 31.</T3> NTN states that the Department should issue separatedeposit rates for exporter's sales price and purchase price sales. NTNcites <T3>Correction to Final Results of Administrative Review: Replacement Partsfor Self-Propelled Bituminous Paving Equipment from Canada,</T3> 43 FR7600 (March 5, 1986), in support of its statement. Petitioner states that in the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan,</T3> 52FR 30700 (August 17, 1987), the Department set only one deposit rate, eventhough NTN had requested separate rates in that case as well. Petitionerfurther states that NTN has supplied no sufficient rationale justifyinga departure from the long standing practice of establishing only one depositrate. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> It is the Department's general practice not to issueseparate rates for ESP and PP sales. The relatively small quantities involvedin this case do not warrant a departure from our general practice, norhas NTN provided any other rationale for such a departure.J. VAT <T3>Comment 32.</T3> SNR and ICSA contend that there should be a circumstanceof sale adjustment for the VAT included in all home market prices. SNRargues that <T3>Zenith v. United States, </T3>633 F. Supp. 1382 (CIT l986) requiresthe Department to calculate and add to the U.S. and home market pricesthe ``hypothetical'' value added tax (VAT) that would have been paid ifthe product had been sold in the home market. If the home market VAT exceedsthe VAT amount added to the U.S. price, SNR argues that the Departmentshould deduct from the reported home market prices the difference betweenthe home market VAT and the VAT added to the U.S. price. Petitioner contends that the Department's SNR verification report doesnot mention VAT, and inasmuch as SNR's submission constitutes new information,SNR should not be allowed to submit this new sales data. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> We have made an addition to SNR's and ICSA's U.S.price for the verified VAT in the home market under section 772(d)(1)(c)of the Act. We calculated the addition to U.S. price by first deductingall U.S. selling expenses and movement charges from the U.S. gross unitprice and then adding to this packed-for-export price the hypotheticaltax that would have been paid had that product been subject to the tax.We then made a circumstance of sale adjustment to the foreign market valueto eliminate the absolute difference between the amount of tax in the twomarkets. With regard to petitioner's statement that SNR's submission constitutesnew information, we have used the originally reported home market prices,which were verified to be net of the VAT. Petitioner's concern is, therefore,unfounded. K. Voluntary Respondent <T3>Comment 33.</T3> Cooper contends that the Department unjustifiablyrejected its request to calculate a margin specifically for Cooper. Cooperacknowledges that its voluntary questionnaire response exceeded the statedDepartment deadline by almost two weeks. However, Cooper argues that theDepartment had sufficient time to analyze the response in view of the factthat the response was received more than seven weeks before the preliminarydetermination and more than six months before the final determination.Cooper submits that basic fairness requires the Department to use its datasince its situation is unique and is not applicable to companies that chosenot to respond. Cooper also contends that the Department exceeded its discretion in notdesignating Cooper as a mandatory respondent and in not following the 60percent rule set forth in 19 CFR 353.38(a). On November 2, 1988, Coopernoted that, based on RHP's nonconfidential questionnaire response, thevalue of Cooper's shipments of cylindrical roller bearings from the UnitedKingdom during the review period was several times larger than RHP's. Cooperargues that case complexity and administrative convenience cannot justifydenying the party that accounts for a greater percentage of the value ofsales the right to have its data reviewed while there is still ample timefor analysis. Cooper contends that it is unfair to use RHP's data in applying a rateto Cooper because: (1) RHP's data is not representative of Cooper's data;(2) including Cooper's data would improve the accuracy of the Department'sanalysis of sales of cylindrical roller bearings from the U.K.; (3) Cooperaccounts for the vast majority of shipments of cylindrical roller bearingsfrom the U.K.; and (4) Cooper's product is sold under market conditionsdifferent from those of RHP. In addition, Cooper contends that it is theDepartment's responsibility, not Cooper's, to identify the proper respondentsin a proceeding. The Department had the confidential questionnaire responsesby September 19, 1988 and could have conducted an analysis to confirm theappropriate mandatory respondents. Petitioner contends that the Department has properly determined not todevelop a separate dumping margin for imports manufactured by Cooper. Inaddition, petitioner maintains that Cooper must be included with thosecompanies whose imports are covered by the ``All Other'' rates calculatedby the Department in this investigation. <T3>DOC Position.</T3> The Department has not calculated a separate marginfor imports of cylindrical roller bearings manufactured by Cooper, andthe ``All Other'' rate will continue to apply. Cooper submitted a voluntaryresponse after the deadline set by the Department for submission. Our instructionsto all voluntary respondents clearly stated that ``[a]lthough the Departmentis not obligated to consider voluntary responses, we will review responsesthat are submitted in a <T3>timely manner</T3>'' (emphasis added). To accept Cooper's untimelyresponse would be unfair to those parties which considered but decidednot to file a voluntary response based on our instructions that the finaldeadline would not be extended any further. Regarding the issue of identifying and investigating the proper respondent(s)exporting cylindrical roller bearings from the U.K., 19 CFR 353.38(a) statesthat the Department ``normally'' will examine at least 60 percent of thedollar volume of exports to the United States. In this instance and aswe do in every investigation, the Department selected the mandatory respondentsto receive our original questionnaires based on information contained inthe petition, other data submitted subsequently by petitioner, informationsolicited from our embassies in the affected countries, and informationavailable elsewhere in the Department. We selected additional mandatoryrespondents where (1) we determined early in these investigations thatit was appropriate to increase our percentage of export coverage (<T3>e.g., </T3>ICSA for spherical roller bearings from Italy) or (2) ourdivision of the subject merchandise into five classes or kinds left uswithout <T3>any </T3>respondent for a particular class or kind (<T3>e.g., </T3>Rose for spherical plain bearings from the U.K.). Neitherof these situations was present here. Cooper's argument that it, and not RHP, was the appropriate mandatory respondentwas made late in the investigation_after our preliminary determination.If, during the initial phases of the investigation, Cooper had providedthe Department with information showing that it was a large producer andexporter of cylindrical roller bearings, we could have considered takingthat data into account in identifying the proper mandatory respondents.The Department must decide which companies are to respond to its questionnaireat a very early stage of the proceeding. The information on the recordin the initial phases of this investigation did not indicate that Cooper'ssales of cylindrical roller bearings were of such a magnitude as to warrantits inclusion as a mandatory respondent. L. Adjustment to Ad Rate for CVD Rate <T3>Comment 34.</T3> NMB/Pelmec Thai contends that any countervailing dutiesimposed on the subject merchandise to account for an export subsidy shouldbe added to the U.S. price. Petitioner contends that, if NMB/Pelmec Thai's sales shipped through Singaporeare included as home market sales, the Department should not reduce theantidumping duty margin to the full extent of the countervailing duty marginas these sales benefit from the same subsidies as the sales to the UnitedStates. Citing <T3>Certain Electrical Conductor Aluminum Redraw Rod from Venezuela (RedrawRod) </T3>(53 FR 24755, June 30, 1988), petitioner maintains that the Departmentdoes not adjust the U.S. price to account for export subsidies found ina companion countervailing duty investigation when third country saleswhich receive the export subsidies are used as the basis of foreign marketvalue. <T3>DOC Position.</T3>  Section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act provides that ``[t]hepurchase price and exporter's sales price shall be adjusted by being ** * increased by * * * the amount of any countervailing duty <T3>imposed </T3>on the [subject] merchandise * * * to offset an exportsubsidy * * *'' (19 U.S.C. 1677a(d)) (emphasis added). The Department hasinterpreted this language to mean that it will make an upward adjustmentto U.S. price only if the U.S. Customs Service has actually assessed countervailingduties on the U.S. sales examined in an administrative review of an antidumpinginvestigation. (<T3>See, e.g., Pipe and Tube from Turkey; Final Results of AntidumpingAdministrative Review </T3>(53 FR 39632, October 11, 1988.)) However, ifsuch U.S. sales are subject to the collection of estimated countervailingduties, we have consistently refused to make an upward adjustment to U.S.price. The Court of International Trade has endorsed the Department's interpretation.(<T3>See, Serampore Industries Pvt., Ltd. v. United States, </T3>11 CIT<T2>XXX</T2>, 675 F. Supp. 1354 (1987).) Therefore, an upward adjustmentto U.S. price is not warranted at this time and will be warranted onlyin the context of an administrative review. It is the Department's consistent practice to deduct the amount of theexport subsidy from the dumping deposit or bonding requirement when thereis a final countervailing duty order in effect on the imported merchandise.Since we relied on CV for our fair value comparisons, rather than the salesshipped through Singapore, we have reduced the bonding rate by the rateattributable to the export subsidies found in the concurrent countervailingduty determination. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-8066 Filed 5-2-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3510-DS-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
