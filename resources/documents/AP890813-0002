But two of the seven regional telephone companies reached asettlement with their workers Sunday, averting a walkout by 83,000employees.   Members of the Communications Workers of America struckAmeritech, which serves 12.3 million customers in Illinois,Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin, after a midnight CDTdeadline passed.   The strikers at Ameritech joined fellow CWA members andInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members at threeother ``Baby Bells'' _ NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, and Pacific Telesis _who walked out a week earlier.   But the CWA and U S West, based in the Denver area, extendedtalks after a midnight MDT strike deadline and reached a settlementnine hours later, keeping 42,000 workers on the job.   In St. Louis, negotiators with Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.and its union reached a tentative agreement at about 7:15 p.m.Sunday, averting a strike by some 41,000 telephone workers in fivestates.   ``We're pleased with it,'' said Gaye Williams Mack, aspokeswoman for District 6 of the Communications Workers ofAmerica. ``We're very pleased that we were able to avert a strike,especially.''   Union spokesman Jennings Wooldridge said the company had agreedto a 5.25 percent increase in base wages for the first year, plus a$1,000 bonus, and a 2.25 percent increase in the second and thirdyears, as well as an increase in cost-of-living allowances.   The company also dropped its attempt to make employees pay aportion of health insurance premiums for dependents, Wooldridgesaid, but there were some increases in certain health care costs.   Southwestern Bell spokesman David Martin confirmed that the twosides had reached an agreement, but released no details. Thecompany has 11 million customers in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,Arkansas and Texas.   The strike had been put on hold as negotiators continued talkingpast the midnight Saturday deadline. The bargainers broke off thetalks at 6 a.m. and resumed Sunday evening.   The regional companies already on strike have said that mostdirect-dial calls were going through normally on automatedequipment. Some union jobs were filled by management employees, butthe walkouts disrupted installations and repairs, operator-assistedcalls and inquiries to directory assistance.   The chief issues in most of the talks have been wages andefforts by several companies to get workers to pay part of theirhealth insurance costs.   At U S West, spokeswoman Debbie Thomas said bargainers wouldcontinue working to ``resolve details and complete otherformalities.''   Union spokesman Bill Frazee said he expected the document to becompleted in a few days and brought to a vote by members withinweeks.   Frazee said the new pact ``retained basically the samehealth-care program'' and provides a 5 percent immediate raise,plus smaller wage increases in the second and third years, a $600bonus and a wage increase based on productivity.   The company would not immediately release details of thecontract.   CWA Vice President Walter Maulis said union members at U S Westwere ``proud to have negotiated an agreement that secures a fairshare of the company's outstanding profits for the workers who madetheir financial success possible.''   US West services 11.8 million customers in Arizona, Colorado,Idaho, Iowa, Utah, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, North Dakota,South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Washington and Oregon.   Ameritech has 35,000 CWA workers on strike, said companyspokesman Steve Ford. Ameritech's 18,000 members of the IBEWsettled previously with the company's subsidiaries, Ford said.   Strikes by CWA and IBEW members began a week ago at NewYork-based NYNEX, which serves New York, Massachusetts, RhodeIsland, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut;Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which serves Delaware, Maryland,New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the Districtof Columbia; and San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, which servesnorthern Nevada and all of California.   No formal talks were scheduled in those strikes over theweekend, but Bell Atlantic and union representatives met for aboutan hour informally Sunday.   One of the Baby Bells settled Aug. 5 with all its workers _Atlanta-based BellSouth, which serves nine Southeastern states. TheBaby Bell companies were created in 1984 by the breakup of AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph.   Scattered instances of vandalism have been reported.
