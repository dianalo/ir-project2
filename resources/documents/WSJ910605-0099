Both tried to keep thrifts alive, but both madethe fatal mistake of trusting the government. When Congressand regulators changed the rules in mid-investment, Mr.Fleischer and Mr. Nierenberg were stuck with enormous lossesand endless litigation.   Neither one is accused of crime or fraud, but they paidthe ultimate corporate price by having their thrifts seized.The painfully clear message is that no one involved with theSandamp;L hot potato is safe, yet somehow regulators wonder why wehave a credit crunch and why they have a hard time findingbuyers for troubled thrifts and foreclosed property.</LP><TEXT>   For Mr. Fleischer's Franklin Savings Association, the endcame last week when regulators won a round in a continuingcourt battle. Franklin was not a typical thrift. When itbecame clear in the early 1980s that the oldresidential-mortgage business would no longer keep thriftsalive, Mr. Fleischer took to heart warnings that thriftsneeded new investments. He began to attract a group offinancial rocket scientists to Ottawa, Kan. These includedWayne Angell (later of the Federal Reserve), Ph.D.s infinance from MIT and MBAs from Chicago.   This group crafted investments in mortgage-backedsecurities and interest-rate hedges, which made the thrifthighly profitable. Regulators were entitled to be concernedbecause the key was access to huge pools of funds frombrokered deposits backed by deposit insurance, but this wasnot what got Franklin in trouble. The problem, according tothe trial judge who heard the case, was that regulatorscouldn't figure out what the thrift was doing -- and sodidn't like it.   Regulators &quot;appeared to lack adequate training andunderstanding to evaluate the nature of Franklin'soperation,&quot; Federal Judge Dale Saffels wrote last year. Henoted that the analyst assigned to the case had read only oneForm 10K before and assumed the disclosures under &quot;materialadverse risk&quot; applied to banking risks when they wereactually boilerplate securities-law warnings. Judge Saffelswrote that the seizure of Franklin was &quot;arbitrary, capriciousand unreasonable conduct.&quot;   Judge Saffels may have been unusually prepared to handlethis case -- he's a former chairman of the board of theFederal Home Loan Bank of Topeka -- but the federal appealscourt in Denver was not impressed with his analysis. Indeed,last week the appeals judges reversed Judge Saffels largelyon the grounds that he knew too much. The court ruled thatthe only analysis of Franklin that counted was the Office ofThrift Supervision's.   &quot;Congress did not mandate a hearing or specific findingsof fact be made&quot; before a seizure can occur, the court ruled.&quot;Rather, it required only the {OTS} director be of theopinion statutory grounds for appointment of a conservatorexist.&quot; The appeals court cited the Webster's definition ofopinion as a &quot;belief held with confidence, not substantiatedby direct proof or knowledge.&quot;   In other words, even though Congress called for judicialreview of the appropriateness of a seizure, this review mustbe restricted to the record provided by regulators. Itdoesn't matter that the record is wrong. Franklin plans toappeal.   The end came in equally bizarre legal fashion in the caseof Mr. Nierenberg's Far West Federal of Portland, Ore. Lastweek OTS seized the thrift despite a permanent order from afederal judge barring precisely this move.   In 1987, regulators looked for private investors to bailout Far West, which thanks to investments in Arizona realestate and a 300-acre resort would have cost taxpayers $300million to bail out. Mr. Nierenberg and his Trinity Venturesagreed to invest $27 million in exchange for severalagreements by regulators. These included a 10-year recoveryperiod of modified capital requirements and credit for a newarbitrage system. Regulators signed an agreement bindingthemselves to the deal &quot;notwithstanding any subsequentchanges in the definition of regulatory capital.&quot;   Then came the 1989 thrift-bailout bill. Congress alteredaccounting regulations and other weaknesses in the systemthat contributed to the thrift mess. Congress failed,however, to make exceptions for Far West and the otherthrifts that were becoming profitable under workoutagreements. OTS bureaucrats reneged on their deal and triedto shut down Far West.   Over the course of several legal opinions, Federal JudgeOwen Panner insisted that regulators keep up their side ofthe bailout contract. &quot;Congress could not have intended aresult so unjust and inequitable as the complete abrogationof a long-term, comprehensive agreement on which privatethird parties relied to invest large sums of money,&quot; JudgePanner wrote. &quot;To abrogate such an agreement wouldpractically guarantee that potential investors will lookelsewhere.&quot;   Last year Judge Panner issued a permanent injunction that&quot;OTS is prohibited from deeming Far West as noncompliant withits regulatory capital requirements.&quot; He also declared thatany uncompensated repudiation by regulators of their dealwith Far West would be a taking of property that wouldviolate the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. &quot;It is hardto imagine any more distinct an investment-backed expectationcould be,&quot; he wrote.   Still, even Far West's perfect win-loss record in thefederal courts couldn't protect it from the thriftregulators. Last week, regulators seized the thrift on thegrounds that it failed to meet the capital requirements ofthe 1989 bailout bill -- despite Judge Panner's warning thatany such seizure would be unconstitutional.   Mr. Nierenberg said that the thrift would have done wellif it weren't for regulators violating their side of theforbearance agreement. A trial is scheduled in July fordamages from the government's breach of contract and a claimthat regulators violated the Constitution's prohibitionagainst taking private property without compensation. If thegovernment loses again in court, taxpayers will have tocompensate Mr. Nierenberg and his partners for their losses.The taxpayers are also now stuck with Far West with noprospect of attracting new private investors.   Franklin's Mr. Fleischer recently gave a speech,&quot;Combating Regulatory Mismanagement in Banking Sectors,&quot;where one modest proposal was that &quot;criminal penalties andprofessional standards must be applied equally to banks andtheir regulators.&quot; This would offer some protection fromregulatory abuses.   On the other hand, as Franklin and Far West learned,financial institutions can't stay in business long enough tofight bureaucrats in court. As a government lawyer told alawyer for Franklin, &quot;When you litigate against thegovernment, it's like dancing with a bear. You don't stopdancing until the bear is ready to quit.&quot; Meanwhile, theeconomy waits for the bear of abusive litigation to take abreather.</TEXT></DOC>
