Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LT WCI </CO><IN> TNM FLX TEL </IN><DATELINE> CULVER CITY, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Merv Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Lorimar Telepictures Corp., is negotiating to form a new entertainment company with about $56 million from Warner Communications Inc. and about $22 million of his own.    The disclosure, which had been expected, was made in proxy materials sent to Lorimar shareholders late last month. The new concern would be formed after Warner's planned acquisition of Lorimar in a stock swap valued at $14 a share, or more than $640 million. Lorimar holders are to vote on the acquisition at the company's Oct. 3 annual meeting.    The new company &quot;would seek acquisitions and other investment opportunities,&quot; to be jointly determined by Mr. Adelson and Warner, according to the proxy statement. Additional financing for the new company would be raised from certain corporate and institutional investors, including Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has long served as Lorimar's investment banker.    Mr. Adelson is to receive a $4.8 million settlement as part of the Warner-Lorimar merger agreement. The executive also has a backup agreement to serve as a director and vice chairman of New York-based Warner for three years, but he will resign those posts once the new entertainment company is established &quot;to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest.&quot; As Warner's vice chairman, Mr. Adelson would receive $150,000 a year, plus options to buy a total of 100,000 Warner shares.    In any case, Mr. Adelson will receive 956,083 Warner shares and options to buy an additional 89,225 Warner shares at $29.73 each as part of the merger. Lorimar executive officers and directors as a group will receive about two million Warner shares and options to buy 357,815 shares.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Warner shares closed at $34.125, up 87.5 cents. Lorimar shares closed in American Stock Exchange composite trading at $13.50, up 37.5 cents.    Lorimar's decision to be acquired stemmed from its poor financial performance, which resulted in part from Mr. Adelson's ill-fated attempts to build his television production company into an entertainment empire with a motion picture production unit, advertising business and a string of TV stations. For the fiscal year ended March 31, Lorimar's net loss widened to $86.8 million from $58.6 million a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
