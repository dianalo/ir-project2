After annealing in oxygen for 1 hat 920 {sup 0}C, the films show critical temperatures T/sub c//sub ,end/up to 74.5 K. Superconducting quantum interference devices (dc SQUID's)structured in {approx_equal}1-{mu}m-thick polycrystalline films witha lift-off technique exhibit a critical current of 2 mA at 5.5 K and35 {mu}A at 72 K. Voltage modulation can be observed at temperaturesup to 63 K.</TEXT></DOC>
