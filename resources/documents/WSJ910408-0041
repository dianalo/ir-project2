Until Friday, the most recently introduced non-financialcontract was for broiler chickens on the Chicago MercantileExchange. Launched in February, its daily volume averagesfewer than 100 contracts.</LP><TEXT>   New financial futures, an area that has seen the hottestgrowth over the past 10 years, also are making ho-hum debuts:The Chicago Merc's contract on Tokyo's Nikkei stock average,which began trading in September, now averages 1,300contracts a day -- respectable volume, but nothingextraordinary. Meanwhile, the Chicago Board of Trade'scontract on Japanese government bonds, which also begantrading in September, is already moribund.   Some successful contracts, such as crude oil on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange, did take a while to catch on whenthey first came out, so there is still hope for the newentrants. In any case, designing successful contracts is anart, not a science. That's why Hal Hansen, president ofCargill Investor Services Inc. in Chicago, says he isn'tsurprised by the mediocre to poor showings of the new futuresinstruments.   &quot;I feel the discovery of a major new contract will happenonly once or twice a decade,&quot; he says, adding that there's noway to predict &quot;what the Treasury bond contract of thisdecade will be.&quot; The T-bond contract on the Chicago Board ofTrade is the most actively traded futures instrument in theworld, averaging about 300,000 contracts a day.   Some people in the futures industry think the next hotcontracts might be non-financial, partly because futuresalready are trading on nearly all the important financialinstruments and indexes.   David Vogel, chairman of the Futures Industry Association,a trade group, and chairman of LIT America, a major futuresbrokerage and trading firm, says he sees opportunities forcontracts in real estate, insurance and interest-rate andcurrency swaps.   But U.S. exchanges don't seem to be actively exploring newideas. Of the more than 30 contracts submitted to theCommodity Futures Trading Commission for approval over thepast two years, only three are anything other than extensionsor variants of existing contracts.   The Chicago Board of Trade has proposed two contractsbased on the profitability of a pool of health and automobileinsurance policies and one on a widely used fertilizer,diammonium phosphate.   However, exchanges abroad are moving into new areas. TheLondon Futures and Options Exchange plans to start tradingcontracts next month based on real estate prices, and it isresearching the feasibility of a contract based onelectricity rates.   However, not everyone agrees that new futures contractsare needed. Frank Pusateri, a vice president at PrudentialSecurities Inc. in New York, who places institutionalinvestors' money with commodity trading advisers, says: &quot;Theindustry has so many problems with existing contracts,especially in terms of liquidity, I don't know why they areexpending effort on looking for new ones.&quot;   Liquidity is the ability to easily buy or sell largenumbers of futures contracts without distorting the price.Mr. Pusateri contends that a 100-contract order in some ofthe currency pits at the Chicago Merc, for example, probablywould be filled at 10 different prices rather than just onebecause that market hasn't much volume or manywell-capitalized participants. A lack of liquidity scaresaway some of the investors that exchanges hope to attract.   Moreover, says Robert Tamiso, a commodity trading adviserbased in New York with about $20 million under management,many of the new or proposed contracts don't represent realdiversification for his clients. &quot;Another contract on adifferent segment of the {bond market} yield curve doesn'thelp me a bit,&quot; he says.   Mr. Tamiso says he could be interested in the insurancecontracts proposed by the Board of Trade, however, &quot;if theyrepresent economic forces different from those driving theother things I trade.&quot;   The exchanges hope that some of the variations on existingcontracts might attract new players. Among such hopefuls arecontracts on three-year and five-year interest-rate swaps andcross-rate currency futures. Cross rates are rates betweentwo currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Swaps areindividually negotiated investments that shift a risk fromone investor to another.   Another variation-on-a-theme contract began tradingFriday, when a &quot;Euro-differential&quot; coffee futures contractwas launched by the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in NewYork. The contract is based on the difference in pricebetween coffee delivered in New York and the same grade ofcoffee delivered in Europe. Such differentials can be asvolatile as coffee prices themselves.   The first day of trading showed just how difficult thetask of launching a non-financial contract can be, as justsix contracts changed hands.   Philip Gotthelf, editor of Commodity Futures Forecast,says many contracts fail because the exchanges pitch newproducts to hedgers but ignore speculators, when both areneeded for a contract to succeed. He says exchanges shouldlook for futures with potentially explosive price moves thatwould interest speculators.   But James Paul, first vice president for futures researchat Dean Witter in Chicago, says, &quot;Exchanges are not in theentertainment business; they are in the risktransferbusiness.&quot; Besides, he says, many individual speculators haveturned their money over to professional managers, so wooingthem is a waste of effort.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy: Analysts, traders and brokers in crude oil andpetroleum products will likely continue their focus ongasoline inventory levels this week. For several tradingsessions now on the New York Mercantile Exchange, factorssurrounding gasoline have had greater influence on crude oilprices than almost any other single item. Refinerymaintenance turnarounds and a rash of refinery accidents havereduced refinery use at a time when U.S. gasoline stocks arerelatively low and the summer driving season approaches. Thedecision to close a huge Mexico City refinery forenvironmental reasons and the damage sustained by Middle Eastrefineries during the Persian Gulf war compound the gasolinesupply equation.   As far as crude oil goes, supplies seem more thanadequate, given that the traditional sluggishness of demandin the second quarter has been made even more lethargic bythe tenacious recession in the U.S. All factors combined,barring events or news affecting the fundamentals, crudefutures prices for May on the Merc will be hard pressed tomove out of the $19-to-$20 a barrel range this week, thoughprices have been called to rise later in the quarter.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans: Grain traders expect the AgricultureDepartment Wednesday to trim further its forecasts forexports of U.S. corn and soybeans.   The department is expected to drop its forecast of cornexports for the year ending Aug. 31 by 25 million bushels to1.8 billion bushels.   The department is also expected to lower its forecast ofsoybean exports by 10 million bushels to 540 million bushels.   &quot;Export demand remains horribly slow,&quot; said Daniel W.Basse, director of market research at AgResource Co.,Chicago.   Wheat traders will closely follow weather forecasts. Theharvest begins in about three to six weeks in the SouthernPlains states, where recent rains have helped ease dryconditions.   Friday, corn for May delivery rose 1.25 cents a bushel tosettle at $2.5825 on the Chicago Board of Trade, May soybeansadvanced 3.5 cents to $5.8875 a bushel, and the May wheatcontract rose one cent to $2.8650 a bushel.                                                                                                          Precious Metals: Gold, silver and platinum prices areexpected to trade in tight ranges this week.   After running up more than 21 cents an ounce to a high of$4.15 in the middle of last week, silver for May deliveryretreated Thursday and Friday. It ended Friday at $3.95 onthe Commodity Exchange in New York, down 11 cents fromThursday's close. July platinum, meanwhile, traded as high as$408 an ounce Friday before ending at $404.70. That was down$2.30 for the day but still $9.10 higher than its price aweek earlier. June gold ended at $362.10 an ounce, up 40cents on the day.   Ted Arnold, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in London, saysMiddle Eastern investors and U.S. funds early last week builtup long positions in silver on the basis of technical factors-- in effect, betting that the price would rise -- then soldwhen the rally lost steam later in the week.   Mr. Arnold predicts that precious metals will continue totrade in tight ranges for some time, with gold meanderingbetween $350 and $365 an ounce, silver between $3.80 and$4.15, and platinum between $385 and $410.   Breaking out of those ranges would require significantchanges in demand or supply, he says, and he doesn't seeanything like that on the horizon. He points out, however,that mine closures and increased demand from Indian investorshave helped silver's price outlook somewhat.   Defensive hedging by producers has limited any rally ingold, says Doug McCormick, manager of precious metalsinvestment banking at Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. He saysthat with gold prices near some producers' break-even point,the producers -- fearing further declines -- are locking inprices by selling forward contracts to dealers, who then sellfutures contracts. &quot;Producers are trying to fend off thepossibility of having to close their doors because theydidn't hedge before prices fell below production costs,&quot; Mr.McCormick says.   Over the next week, gold will trade between $355 and $362,he says, and possibly fall as low as $350. Even that isn'tthe bottom, though, he says, predicting prices will drift to$330 during the summer.   ---            New Futures on the Drawing Boards                                                                                                        Some contracts that have been approved by the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, submitted to the commission forapproval and still being developed.
