<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-35-0079 </DOCNO><TEXT>The potential health impacts of radionuclides released in nuclear accidentsare of major concern to the public and to regulatory and other governmentalagencies. One mode of potential exposure is by inhalation of airborneradionuclides, which could lead to combined internal irradiation by high(alpha) and low (beta) linear energy transfer (LET) radiations. Epidemiologicaldata for health effects of human inhalation exposure are too limitedto derive reliable estimates of risks of potential health effects. However,results of studies in which beagle dogs were exposed by inhalation toinsoluble radioactive aerosols can be used to estimate expected effectsin humans. Data for mortality from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonaryfibrosis caused by internal irradiation of dog lungs by alpha or betaradiations are used to derive the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)of alpha irradiation compared to beta irradiation; predict the expectedcombined effects of alpha and beta irradiation of dog lungs; and extrapolatethe results to humans. The extrapolation to humans assumed that, forsimilar ages at exposure, dog and human lungs have similar sensitivitiesto lung irradiation. Results of theoretical calculations related to mortalityfrom early effects indicated that the synergistic effects of high- andlow-LET radiations should depend on the percentages of the total dosecontributed by high- and low-LET radiations, and for very low or veryhigh doses, synergistic effects should be negligible. 23 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
