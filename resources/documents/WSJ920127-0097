While FDIC Chairman William Taylor stopped short of sayingthe CrossLand action was a major policy departure, somebanking analysts detected the beginning of a new FDICstrategy for tackling problem thrifts.</LP><TEXT>   On Friday afternoon, the FDIC closed CrossLand's 49 NewYork-area branches for one hour, while the assets anddeposits of CrossLand Savings FSB were transferred to a newfederally chartered thrift called CrossLand Federal SavingsBank.   The FDIC's usual policy is to sell a failed institution toa healthy bank for a small premium, and then to indemnify thepurchaser against loss on the failed bank's non-performingloan portfolio.   By injecting its own money and managing the &quot;new&quot;CrossLand, the agency is making a bold -- and risky -- betthat it will save money by trying to restore it to healthrather than selling it in a more traditional transaction.   The FDIC's Mr. Taylor said two bids, believed to be fromChase Manhattan Corp. and Republic New York Corp., would haveactually cost the FDIC more than the the current plan. &quot;Thisis the least costly alternative available to us,&quot; he said. Ofthe $1.2 billion, about $800 million will be used to reservefor existing bad debts and the remainder will boost thethrift's capital.   The danger, said bank analysts, is that while the FDICoperates CrossLand, the market for its valued branch systemcontinues to worsen.   &quot;I question what they gain by delaying the sale,&quot; saidbanking analyst Bert Ely. &quot;They're kidding themselves if theythink the bids will get better.&quot;   Mr. Taylor said the government would operate CrossLand fora limited time, and he hoped to get what was once thecountry's 14th largest thrift in private hands in one or twoyears.   The FDIC also named H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co. executive vicepresident Richard A. Kraemer as chairman of the new bank.   The FDIC action does have some precedents. In 1984, thegovernment decided to take over failing Continental IllinoisBank andamp; Trust Co. and pump $4.5 billion into it. The rescueworked. After the FDIC sold its remaining block of stock inthe Chicago bank last year, the rescue ended up costing about$800 million.   By rejecting outside bids for CrossLand, analysts said thegovernment was sending signals to the banking community thatit wouldn't settle for offers it felt were out of line withtoday's values.   &quot;If the only alternative the FDIC has is to close it downand liquidate, then almost any bid makes sense,&quot; said WilliamIsaac, who heads Secura Group, a Washington bank consultingfirm, and who was FDIC chairman during the ContinentalIllinois bailout. After the CrossLand transaction, &quot;biddersaren't going to feel that they have an option to buy thingsat fire-sale prices,&quot; he said.   With the federal takeover, CrossLand becomes the largestthrift whose failure can be blamed directly on the New YorkCity real estate slump. CrossLand stockholders willessentially be wiped out and hold no stake in the new thrift.   Mr. Taylor said it was too early to tell how muchCrossLand's failure would cost the government but that thenumber would be at least $500 million. &quot;We hope it will besomewhere below $1 billion,&quot; he said.   As of year-end 1990, nearly half of CrossLand's loans werein higher risk real estate investments and acquisition,development and construction loans.   For the first three quarters of 1991, CrossLand postedlosses of $308 million, while its asset base shrank from$11.7 billion to $9.2 billion. The assets shrank further withthe November sale of 25 CrossLand offices in Washington andOregon to Washington Mutual Savings Bank. At the end of thethird quarter, CrossLand's nonperforming assets stood at$1.55 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
