McConnell Jr., which crumbled amid allegations of massive fraud.    The whereabouts of Mr. McConnell, who catapulted himself out of nowhere into one of Texas's biggest and flashiest real-estate developers, remain unknown. Although confirming that indictments are imminent, law enforcement authorities wouldn't say whether charges would be filed against Mr. McConnell himself.    Mr. McConnell and his labyrinthian enterprises were thrust into Chapter 11 protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston about a year ago, with debts totaling $427.8 million and hundreds of properties amassed through a variety of questionable means.    According to civil lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Houston and bankruptcy-court records, the empire was amassed through fraudulent title insurance, questionable financing arrangements, possible bribes, bogus records created in a &quot;sophisticated document-alteration room,&quot; and a strong measure of personal charm.    Mr. McConnell and his enterprises piled as much as $300 million in unsecured debt -- an amount &quot;that will unquestionably equal that of some of the largest publicly held companies ever to go through bankruptcy reorganization proceedings,&quot; according to a July report by Peter Johnson, the court-appointed trustee in Mr. McConnell's bankruptcy-reorganization case.    Mr. McConnell, who once traveled in Texas high society as a prominent developer of Galveston's historic district, couldn't be reached, and hasn't been heard from for six months, according to Mark Browning of Shienfeld, Maley andamp; Kay, Mr. McConnell's attorney of record in the bankruptcy case.    &quot;We are not in contact with Mr. McConnell and don't know how to reach him and can't speak for Mr. McConnell,&quot; Mr. Browning said. His firm has informed the bankruptcy judge that it is considering withdrawing as Mr. McConnell's counsel because it hasn't been able to reach him.    In fact, Los Angeles-based Ticor Title Insurance Co., which has filed a $200 million suit against affiliates of Mr. McConnell, has hired detectives to find him, but to no avail.    &quot;We're all looking for him,&quot; said Thomas T. Hutchenson, an attorney representing Ticor. Rumors have placed Mr. McConnell as far away as Mexico. &quot;I've heard a rumor every other day,&quot; Mr. Hutchenson said. &quot;I've stopped listening.&quot;    A law enforcement official involved in the case wouldn't comment on Mr. McConnell's wherabouts, but added, &quot;We don't want another Vesco here.&quot;    But Mr. McConnell, who has sporadically telephoned local news organizations in recent months, last week sent a statement to the Galveston Daily News blaming the bankruptcy filing on the &quot;collapse of the Texas economy and the problems of the Texas financial institutions.&quot;    In the statement, Mr. McConnell declared that he &quot;does not roll over and drop dead,&quot; and suggested he had not lost his capacity for thinking big. He asserted that he will offer his own reorganization plan within a month, creating a new company to be owned by creditors, &quot;with an eventual goal of public trading.&quot;    He said he has received 17 death threats but emphasized that &quot;he's not giving up on his creditors -- he knows which debts are right -- he knows which debts should be paid -- and he fully intends to pay them.&quot;    Mr. McConnell said in the statement that &quot;he is making this announcement to say, 'Let's move forward,' and people who know him know that he can make things happen.&quot;    Mr. McConnell launched a spree of real-estate buying and borrowing that reached its peak long after the local oil-based economy hit the skids.    He bought old, run-down homes in changing neighborhoods. He snapped up decrepit apartment projects inhabited by poor tenants. He acquired the posh Grand Hotel, located in Houston's most teeming commercial district. He built and purchased property in nearby Galveston, where he and local industrialists sponsored appearances by world-famous architects to celebrate the city's revitalization efforts.    He purchased and leased back factories and office buildings, bought interests in banks and thrifts and even became a stockholder in a major trash-hauling business that itself has gone into Chapter 11 proceedings, according to the report by Mr. Johnson, the bankruptcy trustee.    He financed his expansion from several seemingly inexhaustible sources. Amid the local real-estate bust, Mr. McConnell bought many of his properties from lending institutions that previously had foreclosed on them -- and often obtained the financing from the same lender, according to the trustee's report.    Daniel H. Johnston Jr., an attorney representing Mr. Johnson, said Mr. McConnell was never bashful about paying top dollar for properties.    &quot;The prices in many cases were unreasonably high at the times he bought them,&quot; Mr. Johnston said. &quot;He appears never to have negotiated.&quot;    In addition, Mr. McConnell relied on numerous people as &quot;straw borrowers&quot; who hid their links to him in order to evade lending limits, according to the lawsuit filed by Ticor, in a U.S. District Court here. In a number of cases, some loans were facilitated with the aid of lending officers who concealed improper borrowing, Ticor's suit claims. The suit alleges some of the lending officers received &quot;bribes,&quot; including the free use of expensive replica cars and resort properties.    In addition, court documents say, Mr. McConnell mortgaged the same properties over and over by concealing liens. Ticor's suit charges that Mr. McConnell, &quot;his alter ego companies and his straw borrowers&quot; obtained &quot;multiple loans on the same parcel or parcels of real estate.&quot;    Through a &quot;secret appraisal room&quot; and the document-alteration room, McConnell or his associates &quot;regularly engaged in a systematic practice of preparing false and/or forged title-policy commitments and other documents,&quot; according to Ticor's suit. Ticor set aside $50 million to pay claims related to the case. It says 90% of the claims have been settled.    &quot;When you look at it, it was just another Ponzi scheme,&quot; Mr. Johnson, the trustee, said yesterday. He spoke from his car phone while en route to Galveston to meet a lender on a dispute over the ownership of certain McConnell property.    Creditors are expected to get only a small portion of their money back, partly because the multiple pledges on some properties add up to far more than their current value.    Finally, according to the bankruptcy trustee, Mr. McConnell drew funds from small investors who were promised annual returns of as much as 21%. Hundreds sank their individual retirement accounts or their entire life savings into Texas Guaranty Investments Inc., which sold them second-lien loans on small parcels of McConnell-related property, including, in some cases, individual rooms within individual houses.    &quot;They were very professional. They had very plush offices,&quot; recalls one Houston investor who put up -- and will probably never recover -- $50,000 with the firm. &quot;It seemed like everything was secure.&quot;    The investor, who like numerous others were retirement age, said he had been counting on the nest egg. &quot;Now we don't have it,&quot; he says. &quot;It makes it very, very difficult.&quot;    Exactly what became of the investors' money isn't clear. With so many records missing, &quot;it is not possible to trace investor funds into and out of that entity,&quot; according to the trustee's report. Some of the funds, it adds, may &quot;simply have been used to pay interest to other investors.&quot;    Where were the regulators? The report by Mr. Johnson, the bankruptcy trustee, asserted that &quot;such widespread and sometimes tragic damages are the result of either deficiencies in state and federal securities laws or in the effective enforcement of those laws.&quot;    Mr. McConnell's buying and borrowing intensified in the months immediately preceeding his failure, according to the trustee's report. The report theorizes that &quot;new borrowings were being used to service existing debt and new development in a futile effort to prop up a shaky edifice, which was already sinking under the weight of adverse economic developments and poor business judgment.&quot;    The end drew near in the autumn of 1986, when Ticor discovered &quot;two liens on the same piece of property,&quot; said Mr. Hutcheson, Ticor's attorney. The title insurer dispatched a task force that began the six-month job of unraveling the numerous claims on the variety of properties.    Following the entry of Mr. McConnell and several companies into bankruptcy proceedings, the court-appointed trustee quickly found that &quot;fiscal controls were nonexistent.&quot; Many tenants had quit paying rent. Dozens of vehicles leased by McConnell were still being used, some even by former employees.    In addition, the trustee's report said, &quot;Large-scale looting of appliances and anything else not tied down was being carried out by creditors, former employees, disgruntled tenants and others with real or imagined grievances against McConnell.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
