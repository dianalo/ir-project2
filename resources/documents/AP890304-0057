In an unusual effort initiated by Stephen Studdert, specialassistant to President Bush, antivenins effective against the biteof a Pakistani pit viper were located in Iran, England and theSoviet Union, and U.S. Customs rules were waived to place theshipments quickly on flights to the United States.   The antivenins were sought for William E. Haast, 78, who was inserious but stable condition at the University of Utah HealthSciences Center today after being bitten in the left hand by theviper earlier in the week.   The British shipment from the English National Poison Unit inLondon arrived Friday night. But doctors did not administer it toHaast, deciding instead to wait for the more effective Iranianserum, said nursing supervisor Rick Taylor.   ``The one from Tehran is the best one, I understand, because ofits properties,'' Taylor said. ``We will not give the London oneunless Mr. Haast's condition deteriorates.''   Haast was being given plasma intermittently to replacecoagulating elements of his blood. The snake's venom prohibits bloodfrom coagulating and victims often bleed to death.   Haast, director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at theuniversity's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes andis immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunityto withstand the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospitalWednesday.   The Pakistani pit viper, or saw-scaled viper, is one of 1,000exotic, poisonous snakes Haast keeps at the lab, where their venomis extracted for sale to universities and health organizations foruse in research and the manufacture of antivenins.   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from California'sSan Diego Zoo, including one shipment obtained through an unusualairport relay involving zoo personnel, a helicopter and a departingjetliner.   Studdert of Salt Lake City said he became involved Thursday nightwhen he received a call from an associate of Haast's. The associate,who had read accounts of a speech Studdert gave in Utah describingBush's ``kinder, gentler'' approach to human problems, said theserum could only be located in the Soviet Union and Iran and askedfor the Bush administration's help.   Studdert said he immediately set up conference calls with peoplearound the United States and in other countries after doctors andspecialists advised the White House that the serums Haast neededwere unavailable in the United States.   Using an American interpreter who speaks Farsi, Studdert putHaast's representatives in telephone contact with serum specialistsin Iran.   Two different serums were needed, he said, one for young pitvipers and another for older snakes of the same breed.   Vials of the Iranian serum were due to arrive in Utah thisafternoon.   The serum found at the London institute was the antivenin usedfor younger vipers.   Another supply of the serum was obtained through the TashkentInstitute of Vaccines in the Soviet Union. That serum was beingflown to Frankfurt for eventual shipment to the United States.   ``When I decided I should get involved, I clearly did not want todisturb the president,'' Studdert said. ``But I decided, this iswhat the president would have wanted us to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
