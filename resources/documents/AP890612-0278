The court set aside a lower-court ruling that USX Corp. illegallydiscriminated against blacks at a steel mill and in a separate caseit limited deadlines for filing some lawsuits that accuse employersof illegal sex bias. But the court rejected appeals by an ironworkers union found to have discriminated against blacks.   In the USX case, the justices told the Philadelphia-based 3rdU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to restudy it in light of theirdecision last week making it far more difficult for workers to winsome job-bias lawsuits.   The appeals court had ruled that USX, formerly known as U.S.Steel Corp., discriminated against blacks who applied fornon-skilled production and maintenance jobs at the steel mill.   A federal judge in 1983 ordered USX to end discrimination in thehiring of production and maintenance employees at the FairlessHills, Pa., steel mill and awarded more than $12.3 million to thoserepresented by a class action suit.   The judge ruled that statistics showing the disparity between thepercentages of black applicants and black hires proved that USXviolated a federal anti-bias law, known as Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964. But the judge said intentional discriminationhad not been proved.   The 3rd Circuit court, in considering the ensuing cross-appeals,ruled that both a Title VII violation and intentional discriminationhad been proved.   In the appeal acted on Monday, lawyers for USX said the 3rdCircuit court ruling means ``an employer's only protection againstTitle VII liability is to adopt a quota system.''   The Supreme Court cited a similar rationale last week when thejustices, in a major civil rights decision, split 5-4 instrengthening employers' defenses against charges of bias.   In a second job-discrimination case, the court on Monday threwout a suit by three women who said a change in the seniority systemat an ATandamp;T plant in Illinois discriminated against them.   The court said the women waited too long to sue.   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the women had300 days to sue from the time the seniority system change wasadopted _ not 300 days from the time they were affected personallyby the new seniority rules.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said theruling shields acts of intentional discrimination.   The case involves Patricia A. Lorance, Janice M. King and CarolS. Bueschen, employees in ATandamp;T's Montgomery Works in Aurora, Ill.   In the third discrimination case, the court let stand a rulingthat an iron-workers union training program for granting journeymanstatus to workers was biased against blacks.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled last Aprilthat the International Association of Bridge, Structural andOrnamental Iron Workers and Local 201 in the District of Columbiaarea practiced illegal bias.   Eight black rodmen _ construction workers who position steel rodsto reinforce building materials _ sued the union in 1975. Ten yearspassed before a federal judge issued a ruling that founddiscrimination.   The appeals court upheld key portions of the judge's decision,finding that blacks were victimized by a program that trainedapprentice workers to become journeymen.   In other cases Monday, the Supreme Court:   _Ruled that state taxes may be imposed when bankrupt companiessell assets. By a 6-3 vote in a California case, the justices saidthe taxes may be imposed on such sales and on a buyer's subsequentuse of the assets when bankrupt companies are ordered to liquidate.   _Refused to let companies involved in treating hazardous wastesue for stricter standards that could increase their business volumeor give them a competitive advantage over other waste-treatmentcompanies.   _Made it easier to recover lawyers' fees for people who windisputes with the government over Social Security benefits. Thecourt said the government must reimburse legal fees incurred duringproceedings that a federal court has ordered the Department ofHealth and Human Services to conduct.   _Agreed to consider reinstating a $6.1 million award against theArthur Young andamp; Co. accounting firm, won by investors in the Farmer'sCooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma.</TEXT></DOC>
