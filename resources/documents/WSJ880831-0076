Dorfman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ION TBSA HOU </CO><IN> STK </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   New perspectives on insider trading by corporate officers and directors will be provided in a weekly feature The Wall Street Journal is launching today.    Individual officers and directors' largest transactions are the focus of the first segment of the new weekly table. The second identifies companies with the sharpest increases and decreases in the shareholdings of insiders, and highlights unusually large numbers of buyers and sellers.    Since officers and directors are presumed to have a better idea than outsiders about their company's prospects, many analysts view their trades as a valuable indicator of the outlook for their company's business -- and possibly the price of its stock. Analysts tend to pay special attention to situations where more than one officer or director is buying or selling.    But insiders trade for a variety of reasons. Some may buy or sell for personal reasons unrelated to their company's prospects, which means analysts must also watch the timing of insider trades. An April sale when taxes are due, for example, may say little about the insider's optimism or pessimism about his company.    &quot;We think the information and analysis provided by our new Insider Trading Spotlight will make it easier for readers with a variety of needs to keep abreast of insider trading by officers and directors,&quot; Norman Pearlstine, the Journal's managing editor, said. &quot;We think there will be general interest in the names of the largest buyers and sellers, and we hope the table will be of particular value to those investors who view insider trading as an important tool in making decisions.&quot;    As long as insider transactions aren't based on undisclosed information and are reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, they're legal. It was the misuse of confidential information that was at the heart of Wall Street's recent insider trading scandals.    The information in the new feature is derived from reports that insiders must file with the SEC. Using data compiled by Invest/Net Inc., a North Miami, Fla., database service that collects insider reports filed with the SEC, Journal editors have developed procedures intended to highlight the most important information.    The individual insiders' trades are ranked by dollar value, and the percentage of their holdings represented by the transaction is provided to help readers evaluate the trades' significance. The transactions by individuals are culled from those reported to the SEC in the previous week ended Friday, no matter when they actually occurred; the table, however, lists the actual dates of the trades.    Arnaud de Vitry, a director of Ionics Inc., topped the buyers' list by purchasing $8 million of Ionics stock from the company at $20 a share. The transaction increased his holdings 125%. With his wife and affiliated trusts, he now owns about 18% of the Watertown, Mass., water-purification and instrumentation company.    Mr. de Vitry wasn't available for comment. His purchase came about a month after Ionics brushed off a takeover overture from Cenith Partners L.P., a Boston investment group, but the company says the purchase wasn't related to takeover activity and was for investment purposes.    The biggest seller shown in the table was Robert E. &quot;Ted&quot; Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., whose sales of $45 million in stock during June and July came as his lawyers were negotiating a divorce settlement. A company spokesman would say only that the sale was for &quot;personal purposes.&quot;    The company list ranks companies by the net change in shares held by officers and directors who have bought or sold stock during the past eight weeks; the change is expressed as a percentage of the number of shares they held at the beginning of the period. The rankings include only companies mentioned in SEC filings.    To help readers assess how broadly insiders at each company share the indicated optimism or pessimism, the Journal's program searches for &quot;clusters&quot; of buyers and sellers. The numbers of buyers and sellers are shown, with a multiple indicating how much they are above the norm. Companies with a below-average number of buyers or sellers, which would have a multiple of less than one, are excluded. (The norm is based on the average for the past three calendar years.)    At Houston Industries Inc., which topped the company selling list, two insiders have sold their entire direct holdings in the past eight weeks. The two sellers were 1.8 times the normal number, and the nine selling during the latest 24 weeks were 2.7 times the historical average.    The company said Monday that its earnings will fall $15 million to $20 million a month, or more than 50%, unless it is permitted to use a special accounting method for its South Texas nuclear project. A company spokesman said insider sales &quot;a lot of times are separate from any opinion&quot; of a company's prospects. One recent seller is building a house, he said, and another is a judge who wants to avoid possible conflicts of interest.    An eight-week period was chosen for ranking companies because the SEC filings can lag by as much as about six weeks. Insiders aren't required to report trades until the 10th day of the month following the month in which the transaction occurred -- and some reports are usually filed late.    The tables cover open-market and private purchases involving officers and directors' direct holdings and those in which they have an indirect stake -- through a spouse or partnership, for example. In an effort to focus on people actually inside the company and boardroom, the table excludes the owners of 10% or more of a company's stock who aren't officers or directors even though they must file insider trading reports. Often, 10% owners such as an institutional investor will have reported their transaction to the SEC earlier in some other form, such as a 13-D filing.    In the effort to help readers focus on the most vital information, the table sifts out several kinds of transactions. Excluded are stocks valued at less than $2 a share, acquisitions through options or stock splits, and all gifts. Shares being sold because a company is being acquired are eliminated.    Companies are excluded from the lists when the insider purchases during the latest eight weeks total less than $50,000, or when insider sales are valued at less than $100,000. If only one buyer or seller has been reported during the past eight weeks, a company is also excluded. </TEXT></DOC>
