LevinStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/05/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hourly workers for General Motors Corp. are unlikely to collect anything this year under the profit-sharing program that the United Auto Workers negotiated with the company in 1984, industry sources said.    The absence of a 1986 profit-sharing payout would be perceived among GM's workers as adding insult to injury. Many of GM's 380,000 U.S. hourly workers already are aggravated by the auto maker's short-term moves to cut production and by its long-term plans to close nine assembly plants and parts of two more.    GM's $742.8 million buyout this week of H. Ross Perot, who resigned as a GM director and as head of its Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit, also angered many GM rank-and-filers. What's more, Ford Motor Co. is expected to make hefty profit-sharing payments to its workers for 1986.    UAW officials yesterday said only that they expected little yield from GM's profit-sharing program for this year. &quot;Based on GM's third-quarter results and initial reports about the fourth quarter, it doesn't look good at all,&quot; said Donald Ephlin, the union vice president in charge of relations with GM. &quot;It's two or three months before the final numbers come in, but the payment will be very, very small -- if anything.&quot;    A GM spokesman said, &quot;I'm not prepared to respond&quot; to questions about the profit-sharing payout.    Essentially, lower profit is the reason for the expected lack of a profit-sharing payout at GM. Wall Street analysts generally expect the No. 1 auto maker to post 1986 profit below $3 billion, compared with 1985 profit of $4 billion, or $12.28 a share. The GM spokesman noted that, in part, the expected lower profit is the direct result of an ambitious incentive program this fall that &quot;cost hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot;    Profit-sharing, which GM agreed to in 1982 as a partial return for UAW wage and benefit concessions, has been a major issue between the company and union since 1984. After an agreement was reached on a new national contract in 1984, GM's head of labor relations, Alfred S. Warren, predicted that the payout for that year would be about $1,000 a worker. And the union itself forecast at the time that the profit-sharing program could yield more than $3,000 a worker during the three-year term of the contract. Profit-sharing was significant to the 1984 contract because the pact lacked the union's traditional fixed wage increases.    But GM workers' high expectations long since have been dashed. For 1984, GM's payout averaged only $515 a worker, and for 1985 it averaged just $328 a worker. Ford workers, by contrast, received about $2,000 a worker for 1984 and more than $1,200 a worker for last year. Ford officials reportedly expect the payout for this year to exceed $1,200 again; a Ford spokeswoman couldn't confirm that report.    The difference in profit-sharing payouts among the Big Three auto makers is a major complaint of GM workers, largely because the union traditionally has tried to ensure equal compensation among workers at all three companies.    About two-thirds of the difference between Ford's substantial payouts and GM's disappointing payouts is related to differences in the companies' profitability, industry sources said. Analysts expect that Ford, which has 97,000 U.S. hourly workers, or only about one-fourth of GM's total, will report 1986 profit of about $3 billion, which is more than GM's projected earnings.    The other one-third of the difference in payouts is related to the fact that Ford's formula is simply more lucrative. As a result, top UAW leaders have vowed that altering the GM formula is a top priority for next year's national contract talks.    GM's buyout of Mr. Perot wasn't expected to affect profit-sharing payouts. The GM spokesman said the payments to Mr. Perot were &quot;primarily a balance-sheet item&quot; that would have only &quot;insignificant impact&quot; on GM's earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
