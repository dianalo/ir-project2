John Danforth, R-Mo., and Ron Jones, the chiefjustice's administrative assistant.;   The surprise move was made at Thomas'request, House said. She said he already had begun preparing for the court'sreturn from a two-week recess and sought the moved-up swearing in so his staffcould be put on the Supreme Court payroll as of today.;   Thomas, who wasadministered a constitutional oath at a White House ceremony Friday, had beenscheduled to take his judicial oath in a courtroom ceremony Nov. 1.;   Housesaid that courtroom ceremony will be conducted, but added, &quot;As of 12:05 todayClarence Thomas is a justice.&quot;;   House said Virginia Thomas held the Biblewhile her husband took the brief oath.
