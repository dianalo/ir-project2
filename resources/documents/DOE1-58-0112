The product distribution is similarto that detected over a high-surface-area powdered MoS{sub 2} catalyst.Detailed kinetic studies have been performed in the 1 atm pressure regimeand in the temperature range of 250-425{sup 0}C. The initial reactionsteps involve the desulfurization of thiophene to produce butadiene withan activation energy of 14.4 kcalmol. Butenes and butane are producedvia the subsequent hydrogenation of butadiene. The catalytic surfaceis predominantly covered with the partially hydrogenated hydrocarbonintermediates in the hydrogenation pathway. The hydrogen coverage onthe other hand is very low and varies in proportion to P{sup 1}2(H{sub2}). 22 references</TEXT></DOC>
