For the Einstein-Maxwell models,he obtained a constant internal space, while for the N = 1, D = 11 supergravitywith the various possible compactified solutions, a slowly expandinginternal space is possible for a flat seven sphere. His results for theN = 2, D = 10 supergravity with product space, M/sup 4/ x S/sup 2/ xCP/sup 2/, have led us to examine more carefully the effects of a scalarfield in the search for more realistic solutions. A first attempt wasmade for a six-dimensional Einstein-Mills-Higgs model with a SO(3) monopolein the internal space. He found that the inclusion of a Higgs field togetherwith a matter contribution admitted an exact solution for the internalradius and consequently for the time variation of the coupling constantsof the model. He is now involved in calculating one loop quantum effectsat finite temperature for these models and hopes to present preliminaryresults.</TEXT></DOC>
