Especially in the 'difficult' cases, e.g. when thelifetime of the isomer under consideration is very long or when its spinis very high, this new method can yield valuable, otherwise inaccessible,information. In this paper the concept of this method is briefly presentedand some of the recent experiments are described.</TEXT></DOC>
