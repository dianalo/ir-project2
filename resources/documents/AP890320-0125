Artillery duels continued between Christian army units and WalidJumblatt's Druse militia, with many of the shells falling inresidential areas.   Police spokesman said five people were killed, including an armyofficer, and 15 wounded, four of them soldiers. That brought totalcasualties since the artillery and tank battles began March 8 to 54killed and 179 wounded, most of them civilians.   The Israeli fighter-bombers struck a base of the pro-SyrianPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command inDalhamiyyeh, a neighborhood of Bar Elias town in the Bekaa Valley,six miles west of the Syrian border.   Most of the 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon are basedin the Bekaa Valley.   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standingrules, said the raiders destroyed the base and 10 nearby houses, andSyrian soldiers cordoned off the area.   Guerrillas of the radical Marxist Palestinian faction haveclaimed responsibility for several recent guerrilla attempts toinfiltrate Israel. Soldiers killed two of the group's fighters March12 in the ``security zone'' Israel maintains just inside southLebanon.   Monday's raid was the fourth on Lebanon by Israeli planes thisyear. Police say two people were killed and 34 wounded in the threeprevious attacks.   Police said the Druse and the forces of Gen. Michel Aoun, whocommands Lebanon's Christian army units, battled with tanks andheavy artillery around Souk el-Gharb, an army garrison town 15 milessoutheast of Beirut.   The spokesman said shells hit residential areas, the Christianports of Beirut and Jounieh and the airport highway in Moslem westBeirut. Beirut's airport, the only one in Lebanon, has been closedsince March 11.   Battles between Druse and army gunners began two days after Aoun,who heads a Christian government vying for power with a MoslemCabinet, declared a blockade March 6 of private ports Lebanesemilitias run to finance their operations.   Christian gunners aimed barrages of 155mm howitzer fire at theShiite Moslem slums of south Beirut, where most of the 15 Westernhostages in Lebanon are believed held, and at the seaside suburbsKhalde and Doha, the police spokesman said.   He said Druse gunners bombarded Jounieh, 12 miles north ofBeirut; the Christian residential districts Hazmieh and Mekalless inBeirut; and Metn province.   An Arab League mediation committee resumed efforts Monday toresolve the constitutional crisis, which has left Lebanon without apresident for six months.   Kuwait's ambassador to Syria, Ahmed Jassem, drove to Beirut andmet with several Moslem leaders, including Premier Salim Hoss, wholeads the Moslem cabinet, and Hussein Husseini, the parliamentspeaker.   Jassem planned to meet with Christian leaders Tuesday. He said hewould invite former Lebanese presidents and prime ministers to meetwith the six-member committee March 25 at the league's headquartersin Tunis.   That would be the third stage in negotiations on the crisiscaused by Parliament's failure to elect a successor to PresidentAmin Gemayel, whose six-year term ended Sept. 22.   Before stepping down, Gemayel appointed Aoun, a MaroniteCatholic, to lead an interim military Cabinet. Moslems refused toaccept the appointment and remained loyal to Hoss, who was premierduring the Gemayel presidency.   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier SunniMoslem and the parliament speaker Shiite.   The Arab League mediation effort has been complicated by thefighting between Christian army units and the Druse. It is the mostserious sectarian warfare since 1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-old civilwar.   Aoun demands that Syria, which has become Lebanon's main powerbroker, withdraw all its troops, but Jumblatt and other Moslemleaders reject the demand.</TEXT></DOC>
