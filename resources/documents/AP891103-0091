(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush gave Republicangubernatorial candidate J. Marshall Coleman a push today in hisbattle against Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, who polls show leads inhis bid to become the nation's first elected black governor.   Bush, campaigning for Coleman in downtown Richmond, said the GOPcandidate is ``the right man to lead Virginia in the battle againstdrug abuse'' and that Wilder would have ``a sharp eye on yourwallets.''   With Coleman as governor, Bush said, ``Taxpayers won't feel likethere's a bull's-eye painted on their backs.''   Bush also said Coleman knows the issues that matter most toVirginians _ law and order, drugs and education. He pointed toColeman's support of merit pay for teachers and greater choice inpublic schools.   ``But it's when we talk about taxes that we know how importantthe election of Marshall Coleman really is,'' Bush said at anoutdoor rally attended by several thousand people on a chilly,windy day. ``I hear the same things up on Capitol Hill that you dofrom Capitol Square _ and it's beginning to sound like a brokenrecord.   ``It doesn't matter what it is, every issue is an opportunity _to raise your taxes,'' the president said. Bush also planned a stopin Norfolk.   On Thursday, Coleman accused the news media of giving Wilderfavorable treatment.   Wilder's lead has been growing in polls in recent weeks, afterhe released a daring campaign ad identifying himself as a supporterof a woman's right to choose abortion.   Jesse Jackson said a Wilder victory Tuesday would send a signalacross the country that ``something profound is taking place'' inVirginia. But he downplayed any comparison of his own nationalleadership with that of Wilder's.   ``Doug will become a governor, a visible governor, a greatgovernor, but I relate to that state and 49 others. I think as hesettles into the day-to-day management of the state, he'll be seenas one of 50 governors,'' said Jackson, who was interviewed atDulles International Airport in northern Virginia.   Wilder, who did not seek Jackson's help in his campaign forgovernor, was told of Jackson's comments while campaigning nearWilliamsburg.   Wilder laughed and said: ``That Jesse is really something, huh?''   Coleman said he doesn't think it matters how much historyWilder's election would make.   ``He has to meet the same high standards that Virginians havealways demanded of their governors,'' Coleman, a former attorneygeneral, said at a news conference at the state Capitol.   He accused the press of treating instances of ``dishonesty andcorruption'' by Wilder ``as minor foibles.''   Coleman stopped short of saying race was the reason for what hesaid was Wilder's soft treatment.   ``I don't know what the reason (for the press coverage) is,'' hesaid. ``All I know is I see it because I am on the receiving end ofit.''   Laura Dillard, Wilder's press secretary, said Coleman's remarkswere ``offensive and will sicken the voters of Virginia. ... I amoffended that Marshall Coleman is so desperate that he wouldsuggest that.''   Ms. Dillard said Wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized by thepress. ``I will leave it to others to conclude what is behind'' thedouble-standard claim, she said.   A poll that Mason-Dixon Opinion Research Inc. released Thursdaynight showed Wilder leading Coleman 48 percent to 44 percent. Thepoll, with a 3{ percent margin of error, showed a 2-point gain byWilder since the last Mason-Dixon sampling two weeks ago.   A poll published Sunday in The Washington Post gave Wilder a 15percent lead.   In calling the news conference, Coleman invited Wilder to comeand explain his views on Virginia's anti-union right-to-work law.Wilder did not appear, and Coleman released a videotape of ameeting Wilder held with United Mine Workers officials that he saidshowed discrepancies in Wilder's position on the law.   Coleman also listed seven points, among them Wilder's reprimandby the Virginia Supreme Court in 1978 for mishandling a case;sponsoring legislation to pay money to a client who was threateninga malpractice lawsuit; and housing code violations by propertyWilder owned.   In such cases, Coleman said, if he had been the offender hewould be ``laughed out of the contest'' and ``not be in therunning.''   ``But, for the most part, members of the news media have treatedthese examples of dishonesty and corruption as minor foibles,'' hesaid.   On the tape, Wilder says he supports Virginia's right-to-worklaw, which bars compulsory union membership. But asked whether hesupports a ``free-rider'' amendment allowing non-union members tobe required to pay dues to unions that negotiate contracts forthem, Wilder says, ``That's correct.''   After a part of the tape was first released Tuesday, Wilder saidhe would veto any effort to weaken the law and said the tape didnot contradict that position.   Coleman said the tape shows that Wilder is ``so lacking inpersonal integrity that he would take two positions at once.''   Wilder campaigned at the College of William andamp; Mary, where he washeckled by students who shouted ``Why do you lie?'' and carriedsigns that read, ``Doug, Your Nose Is Growing'' and ``Lies, Wilderand Audiotape.''</TEXT></DOC>
