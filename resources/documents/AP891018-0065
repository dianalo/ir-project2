Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said Tuesday he welcomes PresidentBush's desire to clarify what the ban means and what restrictionsit should _ and should not _ place on American intelligenceoperatives.   ``The CIA is suffering the aftershocks of Vietnam and of theIran-Contra affair,'' Boren said in an interview. ``There has grownto be a built-in cultural reticence'' to become involved in plotssuch as the failed Oct. 3 coup in Panama against dictator ManuelNoriega.   That coup, while not directly raising the question ofassassination, has prompted the administration to review its policyon U.S. participation in plots that could lead to the death of aforeign leader.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said theadministration will propose changes that would not fundamentallyalter the 13-year-old assassination ban, but would make it easierfor the CIA to be in contact with plotters of a coup.   Other administration officials have said they want to offerclear guidance to permit activities which, while they may involve arisk of death to a particular official, do not amount to apremeditated murder plot.   ``We want the agency to be aggressive about entering intodiscussions, and not just passive collectors of intelligence,''said Boren, who conceded that he was more hawkish on the issue thansome of his colleagues on the intelligence oversight committees.   Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the committee's senior Republican,said it is ``entirely proper'' for the administration to re-examineits guidelines for intelligence officials. He said he did notbelieve Congress ever intended to prevent them from a dialogue withthose who might be plotting a coup.   ``If a person might be killed incidental to (a coup), that'squite a bit different'' from a premeditated assassination, he said.   But he cautioned that the ban itself should not be disturbed.``I don't want to see us getting into the assassination business byanother name,'' Cohen said.   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., a member of the House IntelligenceCommittee, said he agreed there may be room for clarifying whatconstitutes participation in an assassination.   But he added: ``If it is any weakening of the prohibition onassassination at the initiation of the U.S. government, it is notlikely to be acceptable to Congress or to the American public.''   Following the failed Panamanian coup, administration officialscomplained that CIA officers in Panama were essentially preventedfrom advising the coup plotters because of the possibility thatNoriega might be killed.   When the rebel leaders outlined their plans to the CIA, theagency failed to ask essential questions about their intentions andtactics. When they asked for support in blocking roads, U.S.officials felt unable to respond.   President Bush, at a news conference last week, indicated hewanted to see the restrictions relaxed. ``I want as broad a poweras possible and I think under the Constitution, the president hasit,'' he said on Friday.   Bush said his powers were ``broader than some in the Senate orHouse might think,'' adding, ``I may have a difference with some oninterpreting what the powers of the president might be.'' Borensaid the subject came up when he and Cohen met with Bush last week,and he invited the president to submit any new guidelines to hispanel.   The executive order prohibiting U.S. involvement inassassination attempts was signed by President Ford in 1976 aftercongressional investigations detailed the CIA's role inassassination plots against Cuban President Fidel Castro andothers. The order was strengthened by President Carter andcontinued without change by President Reagan.</TEXT></DOC>
