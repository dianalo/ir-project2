But he fears that a pending government ruling may send his phone bill through the roof.    Mr. Campbell, an energy researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., spends about $60 a month calling up computer networks to find other hobbyists. &quot;It's like a singles bar on Friday and Saturday nights,&quot; he says. &quot;When a lady signs on, guys descend on her like a pack of vultures.&quot;    But such electronic gatherings could soon have a much stiffer cover charge. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to rule this spring on a proposal, sought by the regional Bell telephone companies, that could send prices skyward -- raising some night-time communications charges 50%, to $10 an hour.    This possibility has mobilized computer hobbyists and industry officials to lobby the agency. &quot;We're dead set against it,&quot; says Clark Woodford, an executive vice president at Handamp;R Block Inc.'s CompuServe Inc. unit, which provides telecommunications services to computer users. (Dow Jones News/Retrieval, operated by Dow Jones andamp; Co. -- the publisher of this newspaper -- is opposing the Bell proposal.)    To understand the controversy, it's important to know something about technology, something about regulation and something about politics.    Computer chatterboxes often don't pay long-distance rates to call out-of-state. Instead, they use such companies as US Sprint Communications Co.'s Telenet subsidiary and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Tymnet subsidiary, which charge cut-rate prices. These companies rent private telephone lines and spread the costs among thousands of computer users.    Computers from different manufacturers speak different languages, and the computerized networks perform a crucial service: they translate so the various machines can understand one another.    In 1980, the FCC deregulated these computerized networks, which had the effect of spurring new companies into the market while keeping out the regional Bell companies. Under deregulation, the Bell companies would have to make costly changes in their overall operations to enter this market. If the networks were regulated, entry would be easier. Otherwise, says Robert Woolfe, a vice president of BellSouth Corp., &quot;it's awfully hard for us to play in the data world.&quot;    Telenet and Tymnet, however, complain that with such re-regulation the FCC could order them to pay charges to link up to the local telephone networks. The result, they say, would be a big rate hike for them and for customers.    But John Ake, a vice president of Ameritech, one of the Bell companies, says the networks should pay such access charges. As for increased consumer costs, &quot;regulators have found ways to moderate sudden rate shocks,&quot; he says.    Page Montgomery, a vice president of Economics andamp; Technology Inc., a Boston consulting company, estimates that access charges could amount to between $3.50 and $6 an hour. Networks such as Telenet and Tymnet presumably would recoup at least part of such fees by adding them to their own customers' rates, now between $1 an hour and about $6 an hour, depending on the time of day.    To generate political support, Telenet has portrayed the FCC deliberations in bleak terms. If the agency re-regulates, Telenet says, it will cancel its popular PC Pursuit service and will raise other prices. PC Pursuit lets a computer user call any other computer at night for a flat rate of $25 a month.    Word of this possibility quickly spread across the 17,000 or so computerized &quot;bulletin boards&quot; in the U.S.; many of them now feature messages urging hobbyists to &quot;use your word processor to produce some letters opposing this proposed re-regulation!&quot; So far, the FCC has received about 400 such complaints.    Some influential FCC staffers back re-regulation, but the five commissioners, who will actually make the decision, are sensitive to public pressure. &quot;I'm not inclined to re-regulate any aspect of the industry unnecessarily,&quot; says Commissioner Dennis Patrick, who is slated to take over as chairman this spring.    The FCC could take a middle course and re-regulate but not require access charges. Even that would be a problem, says Philip Walker, a Telenet vice president, because then any state could tack on charges now barred under deregulation.    (Revised WSJ March 5, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
