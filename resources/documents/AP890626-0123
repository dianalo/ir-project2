Also on Monday, prosecutors said they issued arrest warrants forthree radical student leaders accused of encouraging participationin a July youth festival in North Korea, defying a government ban.   They face charges of violating the National Security Law. TheRev. Moon Ik-hwan, a 71-year-old Presbyterian minister, went ontrial Monday, accused of violating the law.   Thirteen students were arrested for seizing the rooftop of asix-story building near the Seoul courtroom. ``Immediately releasepatriotic unification fighter Moon,'' read a large banner unfurledfrom the roof.   Moon went to Pyongyang in March, met with communist leader Kim IlSung and discussed reunifying the nations.   About 1,500 police surrounded Seoul's District Criminal Court,where Moon appeared in handcuffs and tied with rope. About 200supporters staged a sit-in to get into the courtroom, and the judgeordered some of 50 plainclothes police to give up their seats.   At the capital's Sogang University, 500 students yelling``Release Moon Ik-hwan!'' fought riot police with metal pipes, clubsand firebombs. Police fought back with rocks and captured clubs.   In provincial Kwangju city, 1,000 Chosun University studentsclashed with riot police who blocked them from marching to theprosecutor's office, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.   Students threw several hundred firebombs and rocks before theywere dispersed with tear gas, Yonhap said.   Moon's nine-day visit violated a South Korean law forbiddingtrips to North Korea without approval. Seoul says dialogue onunification must go through government channels. Moon could face thedeath penalty, although observers say there is little chance hewould be executed.   Moon acknowledged the prosecutor's charge he visited North Korea,and said, ``It is our disgrace that we have not erased the 38thparallel,'' which divides the two nations. ``My visit was motivatedby the will to solve a national tragedy.''   Moon and traveling companion Yoo Won-ho, a 59-year-oldbusinessman, were arrested April 13 when they returned to Seoul.   Government officials say Moon's visit aided North Korean attemptsto cause unrest in South Korea and discredit the Seoul government.Many South Koreans were shocked at television pictures showing Moonhugging North Korean leaders.   Defense lawyers argue the prosecution should drop charges becausethe indictment was issued by the Joint Public Investigation Team, agroup now disbanded and therefore unconstitutional.</TEXT></DOC>
