The Democratic majority of the House Education and LaborCommittee quashed Bush's proposal and passed its minimum-wagemeasure Tuesday shortly after Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole saidBush's offer would be his last.   ``Most definitely he has said, `This is it. This is as far as Ican go,''' Mrs. Dole said in threatening a presidential veto of theDemocrats' proposal for the second time in a week.   Undaunted, the committee's 22 Democrats unanimously backedlegislation that would bring the minimum wage from its current $3.35an hour to $4.65 an hour through three annual increases startingJan. 1, 1990. All 13 Republican members voted against that plan.   The proposal that was sent to the full House does not contain asub-minimum training wage Bush has demanded. The president, in hismeasure, advocated raising the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by 1992provided employers are allowed to pay new hires $3.35 during theirfirst six months on the job.   Mrs. Dole first outlined specifics of the Bush plan last weekbefore the Senate Labor Committee, which nonetheless backed a billthat essentially mirrors the one passed Tuesday by its Housecounterpart.   The administration proposal was submitted in writing for thefirst time Tuesday when Republicans on the House committeeunsucessfully attempted to substitute it for the Democratic version.   ``This is a compromise,'' Rep. William F. Goodling ofPennsylvania, the committee's ranking Republican, said inintroducing Bush's plan. ``The president has gone way beyondanything I'm sure your side thought you could ever sell to my side.''   That was a reference to unsuccessful Democratic attempts to raisethe minimum wage during the Reagan admininstration. Still, theDemocrats said Bush has not come far enough in raising the minimumand has gone too far in seeking to establish a six-month trainingwage.   Democrats in both chambers have indicated a willingness tocompromise with Bush on a training wage but have said such aprovision must have a clear requirement for actual training and ashorter life than six months. Most Democrats also want the trainingwage, if included in the legislation, to apply only to young people;Bush wants it to cover any worker hired by a company for the firsttime.   In exchange for some compromise on that issue, the Democratsexpect Bush to accept their proposal to lift the minimum to $4.65.   But Mrs. Dole indicated such hopes might prove unfounded.   ``We've already compromised,'' she said. ``Legislation outsidethese parameters would call for a veto.''   Democrats said they hoped for Bush's sake that he was bluffing,with one, Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., saying he hoped a compromiseacceptable to all could be reached so that Democrats would not haveto ``embarrass'' Bush, presumably by overriding a veto.   Committee chairman Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., said heexpected the full House to pass the measure next week. Senatepassage is expected to come soon as well, after which a conferencecommittee would be named to iron out any differences.   Mrs. Dole said the Labor Department projects 650,000 jobs wouldbe lost if the Democratic version of the legislation is enacted asit now stands while 200,000 jobs would be lost under the Bushproposal, which also would expand exemptions allowing some smallbusinesses to pay less than the minimum wage.   The Democratic majority, however, disputed those figures.   ``The track record hasn't proven that to be true and I don'tthink it will in this instance either,'' said Rep. Charles A. Hayes,D-Ill.   The Democrats complained that opposition from Reagan to anyincrease in the minimum wage has left it frozen at $3.35 for eightyears.   If adjusted for inflation over that period the minimum would nowbe $4.57 an hour and by 1992 would be $5.24 an hour, 59 cents higherthan called for in the bills sponsored by Hawkins in the House andSen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., in the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
