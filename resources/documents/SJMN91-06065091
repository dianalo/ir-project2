The flights were rescheduled for Wednesday, theU.S. Central Command said.;    The Red Cross refused to make public the namesof the POWs freed today.;    However, the freed Italian apparently was Maj.Gianmarco Bellini, pilot of a Tornado fighter-bomber downed Jan. 18 -- theonly Italian plane lost in the gulf war. Bellini's navigator was freedMonday.;    &quot;I am crying with happiness,&quot; Giulio Bellini, the pilot's father,said in Pressana, Italy. &quot;I can't describe the feeling. We are allcelebrating. I've decided to leave the front door open because today is a dayof celebration.&quot;;    The Iraqis -- the first of some 60,000 captured Iraqisoldiers -- had been scheduled to be flown to Baghdad aboard a Red Cross planefrom the King Khalid military base in northern Saudi Arabia. The plane thenwas to take the Americans to Bahrain after leaving the other freed POWs inRiyadh, the Saudi capital, U.S. military officials said.;    Baghdad radiotoday quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying: &quot;Iraq has completed thehanding over of all prisoners of the countries that had taken part in militaryoperations against Iraq.&quot;;    The White House today welcomed a Baghdad radioreport. &quot;We're hoping it's all of them that's left, but we don't know,&quot; saidpresidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.;    Fitzwater said that theadministration had no independent confirmation that the prisoners had beenreleased. &quot;We hope it's true,&quot; he said.;    The Pentagon said Monday, afterthe initial release of hostages, that six Americans were known to be still incaptivity in Iraq and another 35 were missing in action, some of whom may havebeen taken prisoner as well.;    The allies had demanded the release of allPOWs as a condition for a cease-fire. The names of the POWs turned over to theRed Cross today by Iraq were not immediately made public.;    After Monday'srelease, at least 54 allied troops were listed as missing and at least eightas still-held POWs. Six Americans were among those known to be held and 35Americans were listed as missing.;    The first six freed Americans arrived atthe U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy in Bahrain early today after a 17-hourjourney that began in Baghdad and took them overland to Jordan.;    The headphysician aboard the medical plane, Air Force Col. Wynn Mabry, said doctorsfound no solid evidence that the six had been tortured or seriouslymistreated.;    Several reported receiving medical care during theircaptivity, he said.;    Four other allied POWs also were freed Monday inBaghdad -- three Britons and an Italian. They were turned over to officials oftheir countries, and the Britons were taken to an air base in Cyprus. Theircondition was not known.;    The Americans reached the ship about an hourbefore dawn and soon were talking by telephone with their families for thefirst time since their capture.;    Among them was Army Spec. MelissaRathbun-Nealy, 20, of Grand Rapids, Mich., the only woman from the coalitionforces listed as missing in action.;    &quot;I'm pleased to report that they areall in good shape and in good spirits,&quot; said Mabry. &quot;They have some concernsabout some people they feel are still there (in Iraq).&quot;;    He said one of thefreed POWs, Navy pilot Lt. Robert Wetzel, 30, of Virginia Beach, Va., had abroken arm, which was set and treated properly by Iraqis.;    Wetzel'sbombardier, Lt. Jeffrey N. Zaun, 28, appeared on Iraqi television during hiscaptivity, his face cut and swollen. Mabry said Zaun probably suffered theinjuries when he ejected from his plane.;    Asked if Zaun had beenbrutalized, Mabry replied, &quot;Not that he acknowledged at this time.&quot;;    Mabrysaid it was likely most or all the POWs underwent interrogation, but he didnot elaborate on what methods might have been used.;    He said the six freedAmericans will probably spend three or four days on the Mercy before returningto the United States.; Freed today:; Americans    15; Britons       9; Saudis       9; Kuwaitis      1; Italians      1; TOTAL        35  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Manama, Bahrain  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910305  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  815  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 5, 199100065091,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
