The two chief negotiators for the Writers Guild of America andthe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers met from 1p.m. until 8 p.m. Saturday at the producers' headquarters, said WGAspokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.   The two sides were scheduled to meet again Sunday in an effort toend the 13-week-old walkout, she said.   The substance of the talks was withheld, as were details of anegotiating session on Friday. ``I can only say the discussions areongoing,'' Rhoden said Saturday night.   The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute that centers onpayments, called residuals, for reruns of one-hour television shows.Demand for one-hour shows in rerun, or syndication, is declining,and the producers had sought to tie payments to a show's success inreruns.   Also at issue in the strike are writers' demands for more sayover changes made in scripts during filming and more credit on andoff screen for their work.   The guild has signed other contracts with about 80 independentproducers, but the alliance maintains none of its larger membershave signed and that the producers who did defect employ only a tinyfraction of the 3,000 active writers.</TEXT></DOC>
