A time bomb was found today in a U.S. government building in thesouthern city of Kwangju and police said radical students plantedthe device.   The bomb was found in the public library of the U.S. InformationService and people in the building were evacuated while army bombexperts were brought in to defuse the device, U.S. diplomats said.Police said the device was faulty.   Five students armed with homemade bombs and knives brieflyseized the service's library in Seoul on Wednesday and detonatedtwo of the devices before being overpowered by police. Nobody washurt in the attack.   Roh approved the freeing from prison or restoration of civilrights to the dissidents after meeting with his Cabinet for thefirst time since he was sworn into office Thursday. The governmentsaid the measure was designed to build public trust.   ``The government wants all the people to join in buildingdemocracy,'' said Information Minister Chung Han-mo afterannouncing the measure.   The political and labor cases were included in an amnesty for7,234 people, most of them convicted of ordinary criminal offenses.   It was not immediately clear how many of the dissidents werestill in prison, but it appeared many have been released in earlieramnesties. Those still in prison were to be freed Saturday.   But several imprisoned prominent dissident leaders, includingKim Kun-tae and Chang Ki-pyo, were not to be released because oftheir role in violent protests, according to Korean news reports.   Opposition groups contend about 1,500 people are being held forpolitical offenses.   The amnesty did not affect people still awaiting trial onpolitical charges.   The measure restores the civil rights of many prominentdissidents who lost them after serving jail sentences foranti-government activity. Loss of civic rights bans citizens frompolitics.   Roh's announcement, which had been expected, came after the twomain opposition parties agreed to reunite following months ofbitter quarreling and present a united front to the new government.   Officials of the Reunification Democratic Party and the Partyfor Peace and Democracy announced they had reached agreement onreuniting the parties that split in October.   Party officials said a convention is scheduled by March 5 toformally reunite the groups. Committees representing both sidesstart work today on ironing out remaining differences, they said.   Elections for National Assembly seats are to take place by April.   Roh was formally inaugurated Thursday as the country's sixthpresident, succeding Chun Doo-hwan.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley saidThursday, ``We welcome Korea's first peacetime transfer of power inrecent times, and congratulate President Roh on his inauguration.''   The two opposition parties split after opposition leaders KimYoung-sam and Kim Dae-jung failed to reach agreement over who wouldrun for president in elections last December.   Roh won the election with 36.6 percent of the vote after the twoKims split the opposition vote.   The opposition claimed after the Dec. 16 election that Roh hadwon through massive vote fraud and said they would not recognizehis government. But many Koreans rejected the fraud claims, insteadblaming the two Kims for splitting opposition support out ofpersonal ambition.   About 1,000 workers went on strike today at South Korea'slargest ship engine plant, protesting a company decision banningelection of a militant union leader, company officials said.   Officials of Hyundai Engine and Machinery Co. said their plantin Ulsan, 185 miles southeast of Seoul, stopped productionfollowing the strike which began early today.   Hyundai Engine is a subsidiary of the Hyundai group, one of thelargest business conglomerates in South Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
