But he faced a crisis on his first day in office: thethreat of U.S. retaliation over hostages in Lebanon.   At a ceremony in a mosque that was attached to the lateAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's home in north Tehran, Rafsanjani'svoice shook with emotion as he promised to follow in the footstepsof the revolutionary patriarch, who died June 3.   ``Despite the propaganda coming from the arrogant world powersour people will not accept anything but the continuation of thispath, which is the path of Islam and the Koran,'' he told religiousand government leaders a speech carried by Tehran radio.   He did not mention the hostage issue.   Rafsanjani, 54, a middle-ranking clergyman from a wealthypistachio-growing family in southern Iran, captured 94.5 percent ofthe vote in the July 28 election to become the Islamic republic'sfifth head of state.   He will wield considerably more power than his predecessorsunder constitutional reforms approved by 97 percent of voters in areferendum. The reforms abolish the post of prime minister,currently held by Hussein Musavi, and allow the president toappoint and fire Cabinet ministers.   But Rafsanjani, said to be eager to improve ties with the West,is being tested almost immediately by the hostage crisis.   Lebanese terrorists, who claimed they hanged U.S. Marine Lt.Col. William R. Higgins this week, threatened to execute anotherAmerican hostage, James Cicippio, if Israel does not release akidnapped Moslem cleric.   President Bush said he is pursuing every possible diplomaticchannel to resolve the hostage crisis, while ``prudently planning''for military action if Cicippio is killed.   NBC quoted unidentified administration sources Wednesday assaying Bush had made up his mind ``to strike back at the LebaneseShiites and their Iranian sponsors'' if a second hostage was killed.   An administration official said a message to Iran, the existenceof which was disclosed Tuesday, had said in substance ``if anythinghappens to the hostages we hold you responsible,'' and was conveyedto Tehran through two channels: the Swiss embassy representing U.S.interests there and through another government he declined toidentify. This official discussed the message on condition ofanonymity.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the UnitedStates was pleased with a statement Tuesday by Rafsanjanicondemning the killing of Higgins and all acts of terrorism. Shecalled on Rafsanjani to act in accordance with that statement.   ``We remain convinced that Iran is in a position to bringsignificant influence to bear on those who hold the hostages andcall on it to do so,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   The wildly popular Rafsanjani is believed to want to eraseIran's image as a sponsor of international terrorism.   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in Tehran on Monday,before Higgins was reported killed, that the threat against theAmerican ``has nothing to do with us'' but that Iran condemned suchaction.   On Sunday, however, Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemiwarned that Islamic groups worldwide would strike at U.S. andIsraeli interests throughout the world in retalition for theabduction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid by Israeli commandos July 28in southern Lebanon.   Despite his sweeping victory, Rafsanjani may have to proceedcarefully, particularly in dealing with the West, to avoid an openbreak with Mohtashemi and other powerful radicals dedicated topreserving the ideological purity of Khomeini's revolution.   The Tehran Times said Thursday the West should follow theexample of the French, who ``succeeded in winning release of theirhostages in Beirut because they made an honorable deal.''   All French hostages in Lebanon were released in 1987 but detailsof the agreement were never made public. Rafsanjani has previouslylinked using Iran's influence to free American hostages to releaseof Iranian assets frozen by the United States.   Rafsanjani took over from incumbent Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whosucceeded Khomeini as Iran's spiritual leader.   He was swept into office amidst widespread anticipation that inaddition to trying to end Iran's international isolation he wouldseek to liberalize Iranian life and revitalize the war-ravagedeconomy.   With his ready smile, sharp wit and fondness for cracking jokesduring his weekly Friday prayer broadcasts, the clean-shavenRafsanjani contrasts sharply with the grim-faced, bearded rulingIslamic clerical hierarchy.   He said at his inauguration that ``when I was preparing myselffor candidacy in the presidential elections, it never even enteredmy mind that I would not receive my confirmation from the Imam'shands.''   The dignitaries wept at Rafsanjani's reference to Khomeini, whomIranians call their imam or supreme spiritual leader, said Tehranradio, monitored in Cyprus.   Although Khamenei, a longtime political ally of Rafsanjani, waspresent at the ceremony, his inauguration message was read out byAhmad Khomeini, son of the late spiritual leader.   The move appeared aimed at emphasizing consensus at the top ofthe hierarchy, since Ahmad is considered a hardliner in the powerstruggle between radicals and Rafsanjani's moderate faction.</TEXT></DOC>
