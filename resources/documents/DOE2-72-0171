The electrochemical impedancespectroscopy (EIS) is found to be a very useful in-situ measuring techniquefor complicated corrosion systems giving information which are not availableby conventional electrochemical or non-electrochemical methods. The influenceof 3-D surface inhomogeneities on local corrosion processes of iron andsteel in neutral aerated media and practical systems are analyzed interms of transfer function analysis of EIS-data. A new concept is presentedto classify corrosion inhibitors as interface and interphase ones. Onthe basis of the results obtained a systematic development of interphasecorrosion inhibitors will be supported in the future.</TEXT></DOC>
