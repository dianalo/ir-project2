Hospital officials said 18 other people were shot and wounded inother clashes with Israeli troops in the occupied Gaza Strip.   The 13 wounded in Rafah included a 10-year-old boy seriouslywounded in the head with rubber bullets and another 10-year-oldshot in the hand, hospital officials said.   The army confirmed 10 wounded in another clash in Gaza's Shatirefugee camp and said it was checking the reports of wounded inRafah.   An army spokeswoman said settlers attacked the construction sitein Rafah's Tel Sultan section on Sunday night, overturning afoundation, slashing cement bags and sawing down a utility pole.   The 5,800 Palestinian refugees are being settled in Rafah, onthe Egyptian border, as part of a family reunification programunder the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. They were cut off fromfamilies in Gaza when Israel returned the Sinai Desert to Egypt aspart of the treaty.   The reunification is expected to take more than a year, andseveral families from Egypt laid the foundations of homes two weeksas a first step.   After the vandalism, the Committee for Gaza Settlements, whichrepresents the almost 2,500 Jewish settlers in the area, released astatement to the press threatening more action if the resettlementeffort continues.   ``The settler's committee promises that it will not rest andwill not be silent until the decision is changed regarding theresettlement of refugees in Tel Sultan,'' the statement said.   Committee member Yigal Kirshinzaft said on Israel radio, ``Wewon't leave one stone on top of another in this place. Terroristswill not be allowed in the borders of this state.''   The army spokeswoman said the military is prepared to takemeasures to protect the building site but would not say whatactions have been taken.   At least 631 Palestinians and 43 Israelis have been killedduring the two-year-old uprising against Israeli occupation.Palestinians also have killed 161 fellow Arabs, mostly on suspicionof collaborating.   The latest victim was a 30-year-old woman, Suad Abu Hadrus, whodied on Monday. She was beaten by masked youths Sunday in the Askarrefugee camp near Nablus in the West Bank, Israel radio said. Itsaid she was killed on ``morality grounds.''   Some Arabs have been killed for ``moral offenses'' against thePalestinian revolt, such as prostitution or drug-dealing.   In Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon,Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen killed two Arab guerrillas in agunbattle Monday, Israeli military officials said. One militiamanwas also killed, they said.   The clash between the guerrillas and the Israeli-backed SouthLebanon Army occurred in the eastern sector of the zone near AynHabbariyah, a village five miles north of the Israeli border. Theguerrilla group was not identified.   The zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and the 3,000-memberSouth Lebanon Army, a mostly Christian force trained and financedby Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
