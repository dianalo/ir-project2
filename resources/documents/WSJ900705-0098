The idea of inviting the Soviet leader to visit the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization is included in a package ofproposals Mr. Bush privately has recommended for discussionamong the Western allies during the two-day London meeting.The proposals are designed to make the Western defensealliance appear less threatening to the Kremlin so that Mr.Gorbachev will acquiesce to a newly united Germany becoming afull NATO member.</LP><TEXT>   A visit by Mr. Gorbachev to NATO would be largelysymbolic, but it could be important. Bringing the Sovietleader inside a military alliance that was formed to defendagainst a Soviet threat would be a powerful way ofunderscoring the West's contention that the Kremlin hasnothing to fear from NATO or German membership in it.   The proposal would dovetail with another of Mr. Bush'sproposals -- that the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact beallowed to send permanent representatives to NATOheadquarters to observe the alliance's activities.   Already, in one gesture of openness toward the Kremlin,NATO hosted Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on asimilar trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels earlier thisyear. It isn't clear when Mr. Gorbachev, who is enduringheavy criticism at a Soviet Communist Party Congress thisweek, would visit NATO, the diplomatic sources said.   Other proposals Mr. Bush plans to present are designed toalter NATO's military structure in response to the collapseof communism in Eastern Europe without so radicallyoverhauling the alliance that its power fades away. Allieswere given a preview of the ideas in a letter distributedlate last week.   Mr. Bush plans to propose, for instance, that NATO and theWarsaw Pact each issue non-aggression statements, diplomaticsources said. Such statements have been suggested as anotherway to illustrate that NATO hasn't any hostile intentionstoward the Soviet Union.   And the president will propose declaring that the U.S. isprepared to withdraw hundreds of its nuclear-tipped artilleryshells from Western Europe, provided Soviet troops arewithdrawn from Eastern Europe. The short-range shells havelittle use because they are designed to strike East Europeancountries that no longer pose an immediate military threat tothe West.   The U.S. also will suggest that the NATO leaders endorse aplan, already discussed in other alliance meetings, to thinout the ranks of NATO troops on the alliance's front line andput them under multinational commands made up of officersfrom several alliance nations.   In addition, the sources said, Mr. Bush plans to suggestseveral steps to strengthen the Conference for Security andCooperation in Europe, an organization designed to easepolitical tensions on the Continent. He plans to suggestcreating a conflict-resolution office within the CSCE,strengthening the leadership of the organization and creatinga CSCE committee to monitor elections being held in newlydemocratized nations in Eastern Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
