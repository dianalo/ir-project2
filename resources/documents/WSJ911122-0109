Mario Cuomo released his plan for aU.S. &quot;investment-led economic growth strategy&quot; and deniedthat his extended deliberations about a presidential campaignare hurting other Democratic contenders' efforts.   The New York governor urged the Federal Reserve Bank toinject $20 billion to $25 billion into the banking system &quot;ifmajor banks agree to make new loans to small-and-medium-sizebusinesses.&quot; He said $20 billion of new capital would supportmore than $100 billion in new lending.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It would be the Federal Reserve taking an equity positionin the banks, which the banks would be required to pay backafter 10 years,&quot; he said in a statement released after atelephone interview. &quot;Unless Washington takes action tostrengthen the healthier banks, Washington will end upholding the bag for the bankrupted ones.&quot;   The governor also reiterated his support for a federal netinvestment tax credit for productive machinery andpollution-control devices, a new capital-gains tax rate ofabout 10% to apply only to &quot;new and productive&quot; investments,an increase in the research-and-development tax credit to 30%and, in time, liberalization of depreciation schedules.   Though still officially a non-candidate, Mr. Cuomo saidhis prescription for a national economic recovery is intendedto force the Bush administration to stop sparring with himand to address economic issues. &quot;I'm trying to get themengaged every way I can,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to payattention to Mario Cuomo, and that's flattering. Now let'shave a debate.&quot;   The governor didn't indicate how he would pay for the taxcuts, or whether the Fed could pump billions of dollars intobanks without that having an inflationary effect.   Insisting that he isn't a &quot;ditherer,&quot; the governor said hehas no timetable for making a decision about a run for theWhite House.   Last summer, in an address before the American StockExchange, Mr. Cuomo floated the notion of a new top incometax rate of 38%, saying that it could be accompanied by a&quot;reformed capital-gains tax structure {that} could slide from33% on short-term investment gains to 10%, or even zero, ongains resulting from investments over seven years old.&quot;   The New York governor said in the conversation that hisplan represents his evolving perspective on the economy andisn't a final proposal. &quot;I might add to it tomorrow or theday after tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;I won't change the principles,but I might add to it.&quot;   Mr. Cuomo said last month that he was considering apresidential campaign but, despite entreaties from nationalDemocratic leaders that he come to a decision, he still isn'tprepared to plunge into the race or to stay on the sidelines.   &quot;I don't know how {the decision} comes out,&quot; he said.&quot;There is no necessity for me to make a decision {soon}.Nobody is being hurt. I'm not dithering. I've decided not todecide. . . . I'm still going over it.&quot;   r. Cuomo dismissed comments from Democratic leaders whohave said in recent weeks that the governor's reluctance toannounce his decision is making it harder for the sixannounced candidates to raise funds and attract supporters.   &quot;Which candidate entered the race on the assumption Iwasn't running?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who waited for me? I'm nothurting the party.&quot;   The governor has said he won't come to a decision until heand legislative leaders in Albany agree on a plan to addressNew York's budget deficit, which could exceed $3.6 billion inthe next fiscal year.   If he does run, Mr. Cuomo almost certainly will counterRepublican claims that he has mismanaged the New York statebudget by arguing that national policies have made itimpossible for any state to provide services without severefiscal strains. In the past, he has cited his own experiencealong with that of a Republican governor, Pete Wilson ofCalifornia.   &quot;No intelligent analyst could say that five weeks is along time,&quot; he said, referring to the time that has elapsedsince he broached the idea of a presidential campaign. &quot;I'm aguy running a state with unique problems. No one in theirright mind could say that is an awful lot of time to take. Noone other candidate will have spent as little time thinkingabout running if I decide to run.&quot;   He said that when he makes his decision he will write outabout 10 sentences, say them &quot;somewhere&quot; and &quot;then get out ofthe way.&quot; A day later he will have a news conference. &quot;I'mnot looking at a specific time,&quot; he said.   In the meantime, he said, he is resigned to being the buttof the jokes of late-night comedians and politicalcommentators. &quot;People are having fun with it, great,&quot; hesaid. &quot;But it's not important now. What's important ishelping to cure an economy which is going to destroy us all.. . . The administration wants to let the cyclical gods cureit. I would rather see us do the right thing now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
