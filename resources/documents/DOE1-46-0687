Thesemeasurements are compared to theoretical X-ray production cross sections(obtained from the theoretical ionization cross sections by the use oftheoretical values of fluorescence yields and Coster-Kronig transitionprobabilities) predicted by the Plane Wave Born Approximation and PerturbedStationary State theories (including relativistic and Coulomb deflectioneffects). No one theory provides a best fit to the experimental data.However, there is a marked improvement in the fit as the Z of the targetatom increases.</TEXT></DOC>
