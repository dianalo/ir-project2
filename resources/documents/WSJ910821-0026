As the people of the Soviet Union watch their countrypitch toward an uncertain political future, President Bushmade his own goal clear at yesterday's news conference: therestoration to power of Mikhail Gorbachev. While Mr. Bushspoke forcefully in defense of a Gorbachev restoration, weworry that the President has set himself a goal that isn'tpolitically practicable or philosophically supportable.   It is easy to understand Mr. Bush's affinity for MikhailGorbachev. The opening of Eastern Europe, the Iraq war,various agreements -- all are foreign-policy achievements onMr. Bush's watch, accomplished in concert with Mr. Gorbachev.   But inside the borders of the Soviet Union, the forwardmovement of the Gorbachev era has been over for some time.The Soviet economy has stopped. As Elizabeth Tucker reportedin this newspaper yesterday, Soviet economic life, even inits major internal transactions, now operates at the level ofbarter. Analysts for months have expected a social cataclysm-- civil insurrections, a general strike or a coup. We gotthe coup.   What is the basis for the White House's belief that Mr.Gorbachev can be put back together again? All around, hispolitical base has withered. He is a party of one.   It is undoubtedly possible to assemble a best-casescenario: Gorbachev returns, the hardliners are repudiated,Boris Yeltsin and the democrats are ascendant, the All-Uniontreaty is signed, free markets take root in Leningrad,Ukraine and the Baltics, stability blankets the land.   For this tale to even start to come true, Mr. Gorbachevwould have to repudiate socialism, endorse capitalism, standup to the people who gunned down innocent civilians in theBaltics and sever himself from the Communist Party. The onlyperson seen doing any such thing, atop a tank in front of theRussian Parliament, is Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Gorbachevequivocated, and ended up under house arrest.   Boris Yeltsin has something that Mikhail Gorbachev doesn't-- political legitimacy. President Bush himself made thecrucial distinction: He described Mr. Yeltsin as &quot;dulyelected&quot; and Mr. Gorbachev as &quot;duly constituted.&quot; And it isworth pointing out that Mr. Bush is now being strongly andpublicly supportive of Mr. Yeltsin, Anatoly Sobchak (cheeredby 200,000 in Leningrad yesterday) and the democraticreformers.   Practitioners of traditional Realpolitik like to deride asidealistic those who've been making the case recently fordemocracy in the post-communist world. But we live in a timewhen the whole world is wired to CNN, watching 150,000Muscovite democrats yesterday surround the Russian Parliamentbuilding to face a reported 100 tanks and protect the manthey voted into office. Elections matter.   The West's elected leaders, the G-7, have maintained theconceit that Mikhail Gorbachev was somehow like them. Heisn't, not anymore. His country is in the throes of ademocratic revolution. The decline of Mr. Gorbachev'sauthority and stature is a function of the spread ofdemocratic events across the Soviet Union.   Mr. Gorbachev, through glasnost, is credited with puttingpositive forces in motion. That does not mean that Mr.Gorbachev can simultaneously effect political reforms andenjoy immunity from them. Even General Pinochet understoodthe folly in that.   The White House has made a Gorbachev restoration itsstrategy for reversing an illegitimate and dangerous coup.But it's hard now to see that Mr. Gorbachev has much usebeyond that. If it is to avoid the bloodshed the world sogreatly fears, the Soviet Union quite soon will have to beled by someone whose powers are derived from the consent ofthe governed. That was the view of the Founding Fathers, whounderstood there was all the difference in the world betweenbeing ruled by the duly constituted and being governed by theduly elected.   The Soviet Union's long-term future is with the democrats.The Gorbachev restoration is history.</TEXT></DOC>
