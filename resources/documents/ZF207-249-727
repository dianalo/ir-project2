Cuffaro, member of the graduatefaculty at Bank Street College of Education, echoes Elkind's sentiments.andO;There's no doubt, Cuffaro admits, that using a computer can make writing alot easier for 10- to 12-year-old kids.andP;  But before that?andP;  &quot;Children needinteraction with lots of concrete materials in order to learn to think,&quot; saysCuffaro.andP;  &quot;Sometimes all the computer asks them to do is press keys.&quot;andM;Interaction both with computers and traditional playthings seems to suit thekids just fine.andP;  At computer-equipped preschools, three- and four-year-oldshappily roam from the computer to the blocks, from the playhouse back to thecomputer.andM;Indeed, other educators say that critics of early-childhood computing are outof touch with the way computers are now being used in schools.andP;  Elkind, forexample, in his recent book Miseducation: Preschoolers at Risk, attacks theonce popular practice of teaching children to write computer programs.andO;Daniel Shade, of the University of Delaware's Laboratory Preschool, saysElkind's rejection of early-childhood computing is based on &quot;misinformationabout what software is actually available for young children and what thatsoftware is really like.&quot;andM;The best computer teachers recognize the potential.andP;  Randy Allen, computerscience teacher at Gahanna Lincoln High School near Columbus, Ohio, wasselected as 1988's Teacher of the Year by IBM and Classroom Computer Learningmagazine.andP;  Allen says that an early introduction to computing can enhance achild's overall school experience--especially if parents and teachers sharehis interest.andM;However, Allen feels that parents ought not buy a computer chiefly for thepurpose of ensuring their child's academic future.andP;  &quot;I get parents asking mewhat kind of computer to buy at Christmas,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I tell them: don't buyanything, at least not until you know why you are buying it and what you aregoing to do with it.andP;  Unless the parents have computer skills too, youngchildren will not benefit greatly from having a computer sitting on thedining room table.&quot;andM;Allen helps alleviate misconceptions about children's use of computers.andP;  Hereare some myths and realities:andM;Myth #1: Only brainy kidsandM;Do well with computers.andM;Computer aptitude seems to occupy an independent realm of a person'sintelligence.andP;  Junior power-users are not all math whizzes and physics nerds.andO;Some of the most exciting and creative computer work, says Allen, has comefrom students labeled average or below average.andP;  Many teachers tell ofchildren who, after years of struggling with written communication, breakloose when presented with a computer.andP;  In fact, childrenhs progress in schoolseems to be enhanced by the feeling of success that comes from submitting awell-written book report or term paper created on the family PC.andM;Myth #2: Useful computingandM;requires typing.andM;True, keyboard skills are helpful, especially for older kids who are usingcomputers for writing.andP;  But many programs written for young children allowaccess in other ways, including touch pads, touch-screens, joysticks, mice,and light pens.andP;  Until it becomes desirable to type long passages of text,knowing where the keys are just doesn't matter that much.andP;  &quot;I would neverhold a child back from using a computer until he learned to type,&quot; saysAllen.andM;Myth #3: Young childrenandM;should be playing with blocksandM;and trucks, not sitting inandM;front of computer screens.andM;This final issue is of major concern to Cuffaro.andP;  In her opinion, evenenjoyable interaction with a computer screen is &quot;small compensation&quot; for ayoung child accustomed to interacting directly with the environment, usinglarge-muscle, full-bodied movements.andM;But educational experts who encourage early computer use stress theimportance of balance.andP;  They point out that much of young children's healthyplay is sedentary, involving blocks, dolls, drawing, and picture books.andO;Wonderful learning experiences can take place in all of those arenas, just asthey can on the playground.andP;  Computers should never replace Legos or trucksor paints; the secret is to help our children balance their activities foroptimum physical and mental health.andM;&quot;To say that the young child should be protected from exposure to computers,&quot;says Shade of the University of Delaware, &quot;is tantamount to keeping theelectric toothbrush under lock and key&quot;--or, perhaps a better parallel, torefusing to allow books in a three-year-old's room in order to encourage himto spend more time out of doors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
