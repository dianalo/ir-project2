Moreover, the paper deals withfilter tests (determination of smoke spot numbers), the measurement ofcarbon dioxide concentrations (comparative tests), and measuring ranges.Access is given to combustion requirements, carbon dioxide values, combustionheat losses and losses through uncombined heat, latent heat and radiation.The paper concludes with data on flame temperatures, boiler efficiencies,ground level concentrations, emissions, and pyridine tests.
