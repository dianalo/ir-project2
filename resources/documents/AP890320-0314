BERGSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. plans noimmediate cost cuts in response to a Federal CommunicationsCommission deregulation move last week, ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E.Allen said Monday.   Abolishing the regulations by which ATandamp;T sets long-distance ratesin favor of linking rate increases to inflation doesn't completelyderegulate long-distance service, Allen said.   ``The ruling last Thursday is a step toward full deregulation ofATandamp;T, but it is just a step,'' he told a news conference before ameeting of the Economic Club of Detroit.   The deregulation is intended partly to give ATandamp;T incentives toincrease efficiency, since its profits will no longer be limited toa fixed rate of return on investment. But Allen said, ``We're notplanning any cost-cutting moves as a result of the decision.''   Also at the news conference, Allen questioned the prospects forwhat he said is needed federal deficit-fighting action, and hevoiced his own irritation with automated, tape-recorded salespitches to people's home telephones.   Allen questioned whether Congress and President Bush'sadministration, after squabbling over stage-setting matters such asJohn Tower's unsuccessful nomination as defense secretary, can getalong well enough to battle the federal budget deficit.   Definite action also is needed to reverse nearly 10 years ofignoring the national debt, Allen said.   ``A lot of people are saying the right things. At this point I ama little skeptical about that. I am not sure that recent events inWashington will create the kind of harmony between the leadershipand the administration to make that happen.''   But he said, ``There's always hope with a new administration.''   Regarding computer-operated, tape-recorded sales messages somecompanies automatically play over people's telephones, Allen said hedid not favor regulatory action.   ``I don't like it,'' Allen said. ``I am personally offended by acomputer trying to talk to me.''   Allen said it was up to customers to discourage such salestactics through their reaction against products marketed that way.   ``Innovators will always find ways to market their products,'' hesaid. ``But the marketplace works. If most people find themoffensive, they won't be rewarded for their efforts, and they willtry something else.''</TEXT></DOC>
