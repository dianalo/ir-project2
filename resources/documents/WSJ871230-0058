HuntStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   This year has been a pretty good one for the Democratic Party. It just hasn't been that good for the party's presidential candidates.    Conversely, 1987 leaves the top Republican presidential contenders -- Vice President George Bush and Sen. Robert Dole -- in seemingly splendid shape. But the year saw the GOP's hopes of achieving political dominance plummet.    This anomaly provides an interesting backdrop for the 1988 presidential contest. Which is more important in gauging the shape of the race: the showing of individuals or institutions?    Republicans essentially argue that the voters aren't going to choose a party but will select an individual. They believe their candidates demonstrated in 1987 that they're more presidential than the less-well-known Democratic hopefuls.    &quot;The Democrats don't have anyone who has been around presidential politics for 10 or 15 years; they have to grow a whole new generation,&quot; says Robert Teeter, George Bush's pollster. He adds that with the notable exception of Jimmy Carter, &quot;presidential candidates have to be around and establish themselves to be successful.&quot;    Sure, the Democrats respond, our guys aren't as well-known yet. There'll be plenty of time, they contend, for someone to become exceptionally well-known -- all he has to do is win the nomination -- and thus the resurgence of the party's popularity will hold the nominee in good stead come next November.    &quot;The two Republicans only are doing better because they have higher name recognition,&quot; says Robert Squier, Democratic political consultant. &quot;But we're well positioned for 1988.&quot;    The reasons for the Republican slide seem clear. For the past seven years the GOP has been riding Ronald Reagan's popularity, and the president's standing slipped this year despite a temporary spurt during the recent summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. On issues, the GOP was benefiting from prosperity; the October stock market crash, while more unnerving to Wall Street than to Main Street, plainly undercut Republicans' contentions about their ability to run the economy.    And corruption and scandals continue to plague the party. The Iran-Contra scandal, while not the bombshell Watergate was, took its toll on the president and the party. The recent perjury conviction of Reagan confidant Michael Deaver and the indictment of close associates of Attorney General Edwin Meese, following scores of ethical problems of lesser lights in the Reagan administration, certainly help the Democrats. &quot;The corruption issue is out there waiting to be made,&quot; ventures Kirk O'Donnell, head of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank. &quot;Corruption is an argument for change.&quot;    But little of this has dented the individual GOP front-runners yet. The vice president and the Senate GOP leader continue to enjoy huge leads in polls when pitted against any possible Democratic nominee.    And Republicans basically seem pleased with their choice of candidates for next year's nomination. When the Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll a month ago asked a national sample of GOP voters if they were &quot;generally pleased&quot; with their candidates, an impressive 64% expressed satisfaction.    Nevertheless, the Democrats have reason to be pleased when looking at themselves generically. After trailing Republicans on a number of issue-oriented questions for the past several years, they have pulled even or ahead in some important areas, especially on the economy following the October stock market crash. A Louis Harris survey two months ago found the Democrats scoring higher with the public on a host of economic issues, ranging from giving taxpayers a better break to keeping the economy prosperous to preventing another stock market crash. &quot;Lately, the Democrats have been gaining some economic credibility that has been largely missing for most of the 1980s,&quot; Mr. Harris concluded.    While the soft-on-national-security rap still might plague some of the candidates, other political experts say the Democrats seem to have diluted their weak-on-defense image as well as their big-spending, big-government identity.    But none of this has helped the seven announced Democratic presidential contenders. They all get relatively mediocre marks from the public, and there's clear disappointment among party leaders and rank-and-file voters over the failure of the Democrats' political heavyweights -- New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn -- to enter the race.    In the Journal/NBC News survey a month ago, Democrats by a 65%-to-28% margin said they weren't pleased with the current crop of candidates and wished someone else were running for president.    Of course, Gary Hart has re-entered the race, and many Democrats think the visibility of the former Colorado senator, who withdrew last spring following reports of extramarital affairs, will drag down the entire field. But a growing minority now believes that the Hart re-entry may be a political blessing that gives more credibility to any candidate -- usually Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is mentioned -- who takes him on and beats him.    But the Democratic politician who gets the highest marks in 1987 is party chairman Paul Kirk. He has kept disparate elements together within party circles, dropped the National Committee's special caucuses that accentuated the party's special-interests image, ended the divided and costly presidential-preference straw polls and forthrightly assailed Sen. Hart's political behavior recently. He now is mentioned in the same breath as two of the more successful modern party leaders: former Democratic Party chairman Robert Strauss and former GOP chairman William Brock.    &quot;He's as good on public relations as Strauss and on political substance as Brock,&quot; says Mr. Squier, the Democratic consultant. &quot;Paul Kirk is the best party chairman in my lifetime,&quot; he says, adding: &quot;Unfortunately, he's not a presidential candidate.&quot;    ---   'Are you generally pleased with the selection of candidates running for (your party's) nomination, or do you wish someone else were running for president?'
