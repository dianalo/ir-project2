Thursday, announcing itwas dropping its $110-per-share offer.   The withdrawal comes three days after the chemical companyannounced it will accept a $132-per-share offer from the Frenchgovernment-controlled oil and chemical concern Societe Nationale ElfAquitaine. Based on the number of Pennwalt's outstanding shares _ 8million _ Elf Aquitaine's offer amounts to more than $1 billion.   Centaur's announcement coincided with Elf Aquitaine's formalcommencement of the offer.   Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of Pennwalt's stock, droppedthe offer because of the Elf Aquitaine development, the NewYork-based investment group said in a statement. No officials wereavailable Thursday evening to comment on the decision, said Centaurspokesman James D. Daniels.   Pennwalt had fought Centaur since the investment group first madeits plans known last June.   During the fight, Pennwalt sold off a pharmaceutical division andmost of its equipment business. The company also went to court tostop Centaur from calling a shareholders meeting, where theinvestment group hoped to replace the directors, paving the way forthe takeover bid to succeed.   Pennwalt's chairman, Edwin E. Tuttle, maintained throughout thetakeover bid that the company believed Centaur never actually wantedto acquire the company but merely wanted to drive up the stockprices.   Centaur does, indeed, stand to make a profit. The investmentgroup, headed by Abbey Butler and Melvin Estrin, began buyingPennwalt stock in June when the price was $65 a share.   It is estimated that Centaur's stock will bring the investorsmore than $60 million.   ``I can't imagine (Centaur's principals) are too upset,'' saidDon Pattison, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell in NewYork. ``Even if they were sincere about wanting to run the company,a profit like that can certainly soften the disappointment.''   Pennwalt spokeswoman Sue Kinard could not be reached for comment,but Elf Aquitaine's spokesman Walter Montgomery said, ``There's notmuch to comment on. This doesn't change Elf's position.''   Pennwalt's stock closed unchanged at $130.25 Thursday inconsolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock's pricejumped $13.12{ _ about 11 percent _ to $130.12{ when Elf Aquitaine'soffer was made public Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
