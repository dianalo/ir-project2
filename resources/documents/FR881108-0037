Background </ITAG>On February 5, 1988, President Reagan approved the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242)(the Act). Title VI of the Actestablishes the Nehemiah Housing Opportunity Grants Program (NHOP). UnderNHOP, HUD is authorized to make grants to nonprofit organizations to enablethem to provide loans to families purchasing homes that are constructedor substantially rehabilitated in accordance with a HUD-approved program.The purposes of NHOP are: _To encourage homeownership by families who are not otherwise able to affordhomeownership. _To undertake a concentrated effort to rebuild the depressed areas of citiesand to create sound and attractive neighborhoods. _To increase the employment of residents of such neighborhoods. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Matters </ITAG>Section 611 of the Act provides: ``Not later than July 1, 1988, the Secretaryshall issue final regulations to carry out the provisions of this title.''This section also makes the notice and comment rulemaking requirementsof the Administrative Procedure Act applicable to NHOP. Since no appropriationswere made for NHOP for FY 1988, the Department did not attempt to meetsection 611's deadline. The Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies AppropriationsAct, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-404, approved August 19, 1988) appropriated $20million for the Nehemiah program. These funds will not become availableuntil July 1, 1989. HUD intends to have a final rule published and effectiveby that date. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Program Description </ITAG>As more fully described below, nonprofit recipients under the proposedrule would be selected in a funding competition using cited threshold andranking criteria. Following the selection of a program, HUD would obligatesufficient amounts to cover the aggregate amount of the loans proposedfor the program and the recipient would begin the development and marketingof the project. (Other than model display units, however, no constructionor substantial rehabilitation may begin until 25 percent of the homes inthe program are contracted for sale to purchasers who intend to live inthe homes, and required downpayments have been made to the recipient.)Within 30 days of the date of the execution of a contract for the saleof a home to an eligible family, HUD would provide to the recipient fromthe obligated funds, an amount equal to the loan to be made to the familyto purchase the home. This amount would be used by the recipient to providea loan to the family to purchase the home. The loan would be secured bya second mortgage on the property; may not exceed $15,000; would bear nointerest; and would be repayable to HUD upon the sale, lease or other transferof the property. A. Assistance ProvidedUnder NHOP, HUD would provide assistance in the form of grants to nonprofitrecipients. Recipients must use the assistance to provide loans to familiespurchasing homes constructed or substantially rehabilitated under an approvedprogram. The amount of assistance could not exceed $15,000 for each home.Recipients must be nonprofit organizations. The proposed rule (andSection;280.5) defines nonprofit organization as a private nonprofit corporationor other private nonprofit legal entity that: (1) Is not controlled byor under the direction of, persons or firms seeking to derive profit orgain from the organization, (2) has voluntary board, (3) has a tax exemptionruling from the Internal Revenue Service. This definition would excludea public body or the instrumentality of any public body.Except for assistance made available under the Community Development BlockGrant program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Actof 1974, (42 U.S.C. 5301, <T3>et seq.</T3>), recipients of NHOP assistance would not be eligiblefor assistance under other HUD assistance programs. (Homes purchased withloans under NHOP, however, would be eligible for mortgage insurance underthe programs described at andSection; 280.103.)B. Program Eligibility Requirements1. <T3>Construction or substantial rehabilitation of homes. </T3>Assistanceunder NHOP is limited to programs that involve the construction or substantialrehabilitation of homes. Under section 602(2) of the Act, the term ``home''is defined to mean any one- to four-family dwelling. The term includesany dwelling unit in a condominium project or cooperative project consistingof not more than four dwelling units, any townhouse, and any manufacturedhome. Proposed andSection; 280.5 reflects this statutory definition. Proposed andSection; 280.5 provides that rehabilitation means labor, material,and other costs of improving buildings, including repair directed towardan accumulation of deferred maintenance, replacement of principal fixturesand components of existing buildings, security devices, and improvementsthrough alterations or incidental additions to, or enhancement of, existingbuildings, including improvements to increase the efficient use of energyin buildings. A home would be substantially rehabilitated if the rehabilitationcosts are in excess of 60 percent of the maximum sales price of the home,or if the home to be rehabilitated is a vacant, abandoned structure. (Seesection 602(8) of the Act.)2. <T3>Program size requirements.</T3> Programs under NHOP must be of a sufficientsize to create a major impact on the distressed neighborhood; to withstandthe forces of deterioration that would surround the redeveloped neighborhood;and to obtain other advantages such as economies of scale in the buildingprocess, reduced costs of compliance with local regulations, and reducedper unit legal, architectural, engineering and selling costs. H. Rep. No.100-122, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. 95-96, 97 (1987) and S. Rep. No. 100-21,100th Cong. 1st Sess. 23 (1987). Accordingly, section 606(e)(1) of theAct provides that a program may be approved only if the program meets minimumsize limitations, based upon the number of existing dwelling units in theunit of general local government that provides the most assistance to theprogram.These program size requirements are reflected in proposed andSection; 280.105(a),which states that the minimum number of homes in the program is: 250, ifthe unit of general local government has more than 100,000 existing dwellingunits; .25 percent of the number of existing dwelling units in the unitof general local government, if the number of existing dwelling units isbetween 20,000 and 100,000; or 50 homes, if the unit of general local governmenthas less than 20,000 existing dwelling units.For the purpose of determining which unit of general local government providesthe most assistance, HUD would consider both financial and other contributionsto the program. Contributions are defined as financial or other contributionsthat result in program cost reductions that will be reflected in the salesprice of homes purchased under the program, or that result in the reductionof carrying charges to families purchasing homes under the program. Contributionsmay include cash contributions to the program; the waiver or modificationof construction, development or zoning requirements; the provision of no-interestconstruction loans; ``in kind'' donations of land, structures, equipment,materials and supplies; home loan programs that provide below-market interestrates, or principal or interest payment reductions, to families purchasinghomes under the program, and property tax abatement to families purchasinghomes under the program. Contributions exclude the time or services contributedby volunteers, and contributions provided with funds obtained through aFederally assisted program, except for contributions made available underthe Community Development Block Grant Program.For the purpose of computing the number of existing dwelling units locatedwithin a unit of general local government, HUD would use the number of``housing units'' in the unit of general local government, as reportedin the most recent decennial Census. Housing unit as used in the Censusincludes a house, an apartment, a group of rooms, or a single room occupiedas separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separateliving quarters. HUD would use the Census number, unless the applicantsubmits a revised estimate and supporting documentation demonstrating thatthe number of housing units has changed significantly since the most recentdecennial Census.Projects of the size required under the statute may be difficult to developunder certain circumstances (for example, in cities where there is littlevacant or government-owned land, or where a different type of developmentmay be more appropriate). See H. Rep. 100-122, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. 97(1987). To address such situations, section 606(e)(1) permits the Secretaryto waive the project size limitations if the Governor of the State or theunit of general local government requests the waiver and certifies, withsupporting documentation, that the requirements would prevent the Stateor the unit of general local government from using the program effectively.Proposed andSection; 280.105(b) provides that HUD will determine that theproject size requirement would prevent the effective use of the programwhere: (1) The projected market demand for homes, the amount of reasonablyavailable land or structures, the available financial and other contributions,or the available mortgage financing is insufficient to support a programof the size required; (2) the construction or substantial rehabilitationof a project of the size proposed will result in cost reductions througheconomies of scale similar to the cost reductions achieved through otherprograms eligible for NHOP assistance; and (3) the program, by itself ortogether with other improvement efforts, will result in a substantial improvementin the overall quality and long term viability of the neighborhood. (Programsfor which the size requirements have been waived would be subject to allother program requirements.)3. Program Location(a) <T3>Neighborhood requirements.</T3> Section 606(e)(4) of the Act providesthat all homes constructed or substantially rehabilitated under NHOP mustbe concentrated in a single neighborhood and located on contiguous parcelsof land. Proposed andSection; 280.110(b) implements this requirement. Forthe purposes of this program, ``neighborhood'' would be defined to meanan area that (a) has a population of at least 2,500 persons, and (b) isdistinguishable from other areas on the basis of one or more significantfeatures, such as: (1) Natural or man-made boundaries; (2) a locally recognizedname, formal or informal; (3) an identity as a residential subdivision;(4) an identity as an elementary school district; or (5) distinctive population,social, or housing characteristics. Contiguous parcels of land would meanparcels of land that abut, or if the parcels of land do not abut, parcelsof land that are divided only by natural or man-made boundaries (such asstreets, rights-of-way, or similar divisions) and that are located withinthe same neighborhood. (See proposed andSection; 280.5).Section 606(e)(4) permits homes to be constructed or substantially rehabilitatedin up to four identifiable neighborhoods, each of which consists of contiguousparcels of land, if certain requirements are met. In accordance with thissection, proposed andSection; 280.110(b)(2) would permit approval of suchprograms if: (1) Each unit of general local government in which the programis located certifies that land cannot be made available, at a reasonablecost, in a single neighborhood for a program of the size required; (2)the applicant demonstrates that substantial rehabilitation and constructionin the neighborhoods would result in cost reductions through economiesof scale, comparable to the cost reductions achieved by other programsunder NHOP (including economies of scale in the construction process, reducedcosts of compliance with State and local laws and regulations, and reducedper unit legal, architectural, engineering, and sales costs); and (3) theapplicant demonstrates that the program, by itself or together with otherimprovement efforts that are or will be undertaken in the neighborhoods(such as the construction or rehabilitation of other structures, improvementsto facilities or services, or expansion of private enterprise in the neighborhood),would result in a substantial improvement in the overall quality and long-termviability of the neighborhood.(b) <T3>Census tract or neighborhood income limitations.</T3> Two purposesof NHOP are to rebuild distressed neighborhoods and to promote homeownershipfor families who would not otherwise be able to purchase a home. The programwould accomplish these purposes by two forms of targeting. The first iscontained in section 606(e)(3) of the Act, which restricts home developmentto Census tracts (or identifiable neighborhoods within Census tracts) inwhich the median family income is not more than 80 percent of the medianfamily income for the area. See S. Rep. No. 100-21, 100th Cong. 1st Sess.22 (1987). This requirement is included in the proposed rule at andSection;280.110(a). (The second form of targeting is the family income limitation,discussed below.)Section 606(e)(3) provides that ``median family income'' and ``area'' (asdetermined for the purposes of assistance under section 8 of the UnitedStates Housing Act of 1937) are to be used to determine whether a programmeets the median family income requirements. Proposed andSection; 280.110(a)(1)would implement this requirement, except that this section would referdirectly to median family income reported in the most recent decennialCensus, since HUD uses this Census data for determining median family incomeunder the Section 8 program.For the purposes of determining the median family income for the Censustract, HUD would use the most recent decennial Census data, but would provideapplicants with an opportunity to demonstrate that the median family incomefor the Census tract, as reported in the most recent decennial Census,does not reflect the current median family income for the tract. Sincethe Census does not provide median family income on a ``neighborhood''basis, if homes are located in a Census tract that does not meet the medianfamily income limitation stated above, the applicant would be requiredto demonstrate that the neighborhood meets the requirement. The evidencerequired to make such a showing is discussed at andSection; 280.100(a)(3).(c) <T3>Location in MSA.</T3> Section 605(b) of the Act contains the eligibilityrequirements for families purchasing homes under NHOP. Section 605(b)(1)(A)provides that the family must meet certain income requirements based uponthe median family income for a family of four persons in the metropolitanstatistical area involved. HUD believes that this family income requirementimposes a requirement that all programs be located in a metropolitan statisticalarea. This requirement is included in andSection; 280.110(c) of the proposedrule.4. <T3>Home quality standards.</T3> Proposed andSection; 280.115 reflects thehome quality standards contained in section 606(e)(2) of the Act. ProposedandSection; 280.115(a) addresses home quality standards for homes constructedor substantially rehabilitated under this part (except manufactured homes).Such homes must comply with applicable local building code standards. Ifno local building code standards are applicable, the homes must complywith a nationally recognized model building code (such as the CABO One-and Two-Family Dwelling Code) mutually agreed upon by the recipient andHUD. Homes must also comply with the energy performance requirements containedin the minimum property standards under 24 CFR Part 200, Subpart S.Section 606(e)(2) provides that manufactured homes must comply with thestandards prescribed under Title VI of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1974 (24 CFR Part 3280_Manufactured Home Construction and SafetyStandards), the installation, structural and site requirements that wouldapply under title II of the National Housing Act (24 CFR 203.43f), andthe energy performance requirements prescribed in accordance with section203(b) of the National Housing Act (24 CFR 200.926d(e)). These requirementsare contained in the proposed rule at andSection; 280.115(b).C. Application and Selection Process1. <T3>Notice of fund availability.</T3> Proposed andSection; 280.200 statesthat HUD will periodically publish a notice of fund availability in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. This section describes the contents of the notice.2. <T3>Application requirements.</T3> Under andSection; 280.205, applicantswould be required to submit applications in the form and within the timeperiods established by HUD. This proposed section includes the minimumapplication requirements. As required by section 606(b) of the Act, thisproposed section includes a requirement that applicants submit a schedulefor completion of the proposed program which has been agreed to by eachunit of local government in which the program is to be located.3. <T3>Other Federal requirements.</T3> Section 280.207 would address otherFederal requirements applicable to recipients. These include nondiscriminationand equal opportunity requirements, flood insurance purchase requirements,requirements of OMB Circulars governing the acceptance and use of assistanceby nonprofit organizations, conflict of interest prohibitions, provisionsapplicable to the use of debarred, suspended or ineligible contractorsand audit requirements.This section would address the requirements implementing the Lead-BasedPaint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846). The proposed requirementsare similar to the lead-based paint requirements for HUD programs involvingthe rehabilitation of structures (e.g., Section 8 Existing Housing, theRental Rehabilitation Grant Program, and the Community Development BlockGrants Program), with modifications necessary to reflect the requirementsof NHOP. The proposed rule includes the construction cut-off date requirementsand revised definitions of applicable surfaces that were included in section566 of the 1987 Act, and contained in a final rule revising HUD programs,published June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20790).Most activities under NHOP are not covered under the Uniform RelocationAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Policy Act of 1970 (Uniform RelocationAct) (42 U.S.C. 4601) because NHOP recipients will be nonprofit organizationsrather than Federal agencies, States or State agencies. (It is possible,however, that a contribution of structures or land made by a local governmentto a program could be covered under the Uniform Relocation Act.) The UniformRelocation Act was amended in the Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of1987, Title IV of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relation AssistanceAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-17, approved April 2, 1987). Effective April 2,1989, certain relocation assistance requirements will apply to programsor projects that involve acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition, andthat receive Federal financial assistance. HUD, with the Department ofTransportation as the lead agency, is participating in the preparationof uniform regulations for Federal and Federally assisted programs. Thefinal rule will address the applicability of the Uniform Relocation Act,and will include appropriate relocation provisions implementing the 1987amendments.4. <T3>Selection process.</T3> Under NHOP, HUD will use a three-step selectionprocess. The three steps consist of the following stages:(a) <T3>Threshold review (Section 280.215).</T3> In this stage, HUD would reviewall applications, to determine whether they meet stated threshold criteria.The criteria are:_The application must be on the application form prescribed by HUD andfiled within the time periods established in the NOFA._The applicant must demonstrate that it is a nonprofit organization; isfinancially responsible; has the ability to carry out activities underthe program within a reasonable time after the execution of a grant agreementwith HUD, and in a successful manner; and has the legal authority to participatein the program._The program must meet requirements governing program size, program location,home quality and the sales contract._The applicant must demonstrate that there is a demand among eligible purchasersfor homes in the metropolitan statistical area, and that this demand issufficient to ensure the sale of all homes under the proposed program._The applicant must demonstrate that it has consulted with, and has receivedthe support of, residents of the neighborhood in which the program is located,and that each unit of local government has approved the program._The program must be financially feasible. _The applicant must demonstrate that it has site control; and that theuse of the proposed site is permissible under applicable zoning and otherregulations, or that there is a reasonable basis to believe that proposedzoning actions will be completed successfully within four months of thesubmission of the application. _HUD would assess the environmental effect of the application. Applicationsthat require an Environmental Impact Statement would not be eligible forranking. (b) <T3>Ranking criteria. </T3>In the second stage of the selection process,HUD would evaluate the applications that pass threshold review and placethese applications in a rank order based on six ranking criteria. The criterialisted in the regulations reflect the statutory selection factors foundat section 607 of the Act. The criteria are: _Contributions of land. Under this criterion, HUD would consider the extentto which public or private entities will contribute land necessary to makethe program feasible. Land necessary to the feasibility of the programwould include individual lots for homes constructed or substantially rehabilitatedunder the program. _Other contributions. HUD would consider the extent to which financialand other contributions to the program will reduce the cost to familiespurchasing homes constructed or substantially rehabilitated under a program._Cost effectiveness. Under this third criterion, HUD would consider thedegree to which each program will produce the maximum number of homes forthe least amount of assistance under NHOP, taking into consideration costdifferences between different market areas. Cost adjustments will be madeby the application of a commercial construction cost index selected byHUD and announced in the notice of fund availability. _Neighborhood blight. HUD would consider the degree of physical and economicblight in the neighborhoods in which the program is located. In determiningthe degree of physical blight, HUD will consider the condition (but notthe age) of existing housing, other buildings and the infrastructure ofthe neighborhood. In determining the degree of economic blight, HUD willconsider such factors as the unemployment rate, median family income andthe crime rate in the neighborhoods. Because one of the major purposesof NHOP is to rebuild the depressed areas of the cities of the United Statesand to create sound and attractive neighborhoods, HUD would also considerthe impact that the proposed program, together with other improvement effortsthat are or will be undertaken in the neighborhood by units of generallocal government or private entities, will have on the quality and viabilityof the neighborhood. _Construction cost. Under the fifth criterion, HUD would consider the degreeto which the applicant will use construction or rehabilitation methodsthat would reduce the cost per square foot for the proposed program belowthe average construction cost per square foot in the market area involved.HUD will compare the average construction costs for the market area (determinedby reference to a commercially available publication selected by HUD andannounced in the notice of fund availability) with the average constructionor rehabilitation costs for the program (adjusted for cost reductions thatare attributable solely to financial and other contributions to the program)._Local resident involvement. Under the final statutory criterion, HUD isrequired to consider the extent to which each program provides for theinvolvement of local residents in the planning, construction and rehabilitationof homes. One of the major purposes of NHOP is to increase the employmentof neighborhood residents. Accordingly, one of the factors that HUD willconsider under this criterion is the degree to which residents of the neighborhoodwill be employed in the construction and substantial rehabilitation ofhomes in the program. Additionally, since successful programs are bestdeveloped with the involvement of local residents of the neighborhood whohave an understanding of the needs and characteristics of the neighborhoodand a substantial stake in the improvement of the neighborhood, HUD willalso consider the extent to which local residents of the neighborhood haveadvised or assisted the applicant in the development of the proposed program,and the likelihood of continued participation by local residents in programactivities following selection. Section 280.220(c) provides an exception to the ranking process based onsection 607(b) of the Act. To the extent that State and local governmentalentities are prohibited by State law from making a financial or other contributionto the program that would otherwise be eligible for consideration underthe first or second ranking criterion, HUD would not penalize an applicantunder the ranking process for the lack of such a contribution to the program.(c) <T3>Final selection. </T3>In the final stage of the selection process,HUD would select for funding the highest-ranked applications under theranking criteria. To ensure reasonable variety in the program, HUD wouldreserve the right to substitute one or more other highly-ranked applications,if the highest-ranked applications involve programs that would predominatelyserve one geographic area. Upon completion of final selection, HUD willnotify each successful applicant of its selection. HUD will also notifyeach unsuccessful applicant that it has not been selected, and will providethe unsuccessful applicant with an explanation for the denial of the application.D. Program Operation 1. <T3>Obligation of funds. </T3>When HUD selects an application for funding,it would obligate sufficient amounts for the recipient's grant to coverthe aggregate amount of loans proposed under the selected program. (ProposedandSection; 280.300). 2. <T3>Grant agreement. </T3>The responsibilities of the recipient under NHOPwould be incorporated in a grant agreement executed by HUD and the recipientand HUD would monitor the recipient's performance to determine if the recipientis complying with the requirements of the grant agreement. (See andSection;280.303). 3. <T3>Minimum participation. </T3>Section 606(c) of the Act provides thatno nonprofit organization receiving assistance under NHOP may commenceany construction or substantial rehabilitation until not less than 25 percentof the homes to be constructed or substantially rehabilitated under theprogram are contracted for sale to purchasers who intend to live in thehomes, and the required downpayments are made. An exception is made forthe construction or substantial rehabilitation of display homes. Section280.305 would incorporate these requirements and specify that the maximumnumber of display homes that may be constructed or substantially rehabilitatedis five percent of the number of homes to be constructed or substantiallyrehabilitated under the program, or three homes if the program involvesless than 60 homes. 4. <T3>Eligible purchasers. </T3>Under section 605(b) of the Act, each familypurchasing a home under Title VI must meet family income requirements andmust not have owned a home during the three-year period preceding the purchaseof the home. These requirements are included in proposed andSection; 280.315.Section 605(b) of the Act states that each family purchasing a home musthave a family income on the date of purchase that does not exceed the higherof ``the median income for a family of 4 persons in the metropolitan statisticalarea involved'' (subject to a limited exception, discussed below) or ``thenational median income for a family of 4 persons.'' The language of thestatute is troublesome, because data on median income for a family of fouris not available. The decennial Census provides only median family incomedata, and does not provide median income data based on family size.For programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937, HUD is requiredto develop lower income limits that are based on 80 percent of the medianfamily income for an area. These median income limits are then adjustedfor smaller and larger families. See section 3(b)(2) of the United StatesHousing Act of 1937. Currently, for most areas, the lower income limitfor a family of four under these programs is set at 80 percent of the medianfamily income. (<T3>I.e. </T3>Under these programs, the median family income adjusted fora family of four is equal to median family income.) In light of the lackof data for median income for a family of four, the attached proposed ruleat andSection; 280.315 make a similar assumption and uses median family incomeas the income eligibility standard. HUD specifically requests public commenton this issue.To purchase a home, the family's income may not exceed the higher of thenational median family income or the median family income for the metropolitanstatistical area involved. The statute permits the Department to modifythe income standard for the metropolitan statistical area. The proposedrule permits the recipient to request such a modification at any time duringthe development of the program. To obtain a modification, the recipientmust submit a request made by a unit of general local government in whichthe program is located, and supporting documentation demonstrating to HUDthat such action is necessary to achieve or maintain neighborhood stability.If a modification is granted, HUD would permit up to 15 percent of thefamilies that purchase homes under NHOP to have a family income on thedate of purchase that is between 100 and 115 percent of the median familyincome for the metropolitan statistical area. (For the purposes of thisprogram, the date of purchase would be defined as the date that a familyexecutes a sale contract for the purchase of a home under NHOP.)5. <T3>Sales contract and downpayment requirements. </T3>Under proposed andSection;280.320, the recipient and each family purchasing a home constructed orsubstantially rehabilitated under a program would be required to executea sales contract containing appropriate terms and conditions covering thepurchase of the home, the downpayment requirements and repayment provisionsdescribed below, and such other terms and conditions as HUD may require.Congress recognized that downpayment requirements would provide a valuableincentive to save for families wishing to purchase a home, and would ensurethat purchasers have some equity and thus a greater stake in the home'supkeep. (See H. Rep. No. 100-122, 100th Cong. 1st. Sess. 97 (1987)). Accordingly,section 605(c) of the Act requires that each family purchasing a home underNHOP to make a downpayment of 10 percent of the sales price of the home.This requirement is included in the proposed rule at andSection; 280.320(b).To ensure that families will have a financial stake in the home, the proposedrule would also forbid government entities and instrumentalities from providingthe funds for the family's downpayment.Section 605(c) of the Act states that the recipient may require a downpaymentof more than 10 percent, if it determines that a higher downpayment isappropriate, and may require a downpayment of less than 10 percent, ifthe first mortgage on the home is to be held by a State or a unit of generallocal government under a home loan program provided by the State or unitof general local government, and the program provides for a lower downpayment.These requirements have been incorporated in the proposed rule.The statute does not specify a date that the family must provide a downpayment.HUD anticipates that recipients may wish to require the downpayment atdiffering points of time, or may wish to permit families to accumulatetheir downpayments over a period of time. To provide the recipient withthe greatest amount of discretion with regard to the date of the requireddownpayment, andSection; 280.320(b)(2) would provide simply that the familymake the downpayment on the date required by the recipient. This requirementis subject to andSection; 280.305, which provides that no construction orrehabilitation may begin until at least 25 percent of the homes to be constructedor substantially rehabilitated under the program have been contracted forsale, and the downpayments have been made.The statute requires the recipient to pay interest to the family on thedownpayment from the date upon which the downpayment is made through thedate of settlement, at a rate not less than the passbook rate. The proposedrule requires the recipient to deposit all downpayments in an account witha federally-insured bank or savings and loan institution. The amount ofinterest to be paid to the family would be the actual interest earned onthe downpayment deposit. Under no circumstances would the interest ratepaid to the family be lower than the lowest interest rate paid on timesavings (passbook) deposits with a federally-insured bank or savings andloan institution which conducts business within the MSA. (See andSection;280.320(b)(3).)6. <T3>Loan requirements. </T3>Proposed andSection; 280.322(a) provides thateach loan made under the part: (1) Must be secured by a second mortgageheld by HUD on the property involved; (2) may not exceed $15,000; (3) willnot bear interest; (4) is repayable to HUD upon the sale, lease, or othertransfer of the property; (5) must be applied by the family to the purchaseprice of the home; (6) may not be used by the family to provide the downpaymentrequired under andSection; 280.230; and (7) is subject to such other termsand conditions as HUD may require. (See section 604(b).) Proposed andSection;280.322(b) states that HUD will provide the recipient with an amount equalto the amount of the loan within 30 days after the date of purchase ofa home with a loan under this part.7. <T3>Repayment of loan. </T3>As required by sections 604(b)(4) and 606(e)(5)of the Act, loans under NHOP are repayable upon the sale, lease, or othertransfer of the property. The Senate Committee Report stated that the refinancingof the first mortgage will not require repayment, unless there is a relatedsale, lease or other transfer of the property. See S. Rep. No. 100-21,100 Cong. 1st Sess. 23 (1987). This is reflected in proposed andSection;280.330(a) which states that the refinancing of the first mortgage willnot require the repayment of the loan unless the refinancing is relatedto a sale, equity withdrawal, lease, or transfer of interest in the property.If an equity withdrawal is involved, the family would be required to repaythe loan to HUD to the extent of the withdrawal. To the extent that repaymentis not required as a result of refinancing, the second mortgage held byHUD on the property will remain in force until the loan is repaid in full.Section 606(e)(5) of the Act provides that the Secretary may approve atransfer of the home without repayment. The Housing Committee report statedthat the legislation anticipates that the Secretary will issue such approvalonly if the proceeds of a sale are insufficient to repay the full secondmortgage. (H.R. Rep. No. 100-122, 100 Cong. 1st Sess. 96 (1987). ProposedandSection;280.330(b) provides that approval will be granted if HUD determinesthat an undue hardship would result from application of the repayment requirementand that such a finding will be made only if the proceeds of a sale areinsufficient to repay the loan amount in full. Approval will be grantedonly to the extent that the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to repaythe loan in full. In light of the leasing prohibition under section 605(d)of the Act, the proposed rule states that HUD will not approve a leasewithout repayment. To the extent that a sale or other transfer is approvedby HUD, the second mortgage held by the Secretary would remain in forceuntil the loan is repaid.8. <T3>Funding amendments and deobligation of funds</T3>. Section 280.335would contain provisions governing HUD's administration of the program.This section contains provisions addressing funding increases and the deobligationof funds.E. WaiverSection 280.10 would permit the Secretary of HUD, for good cause, to waiveNHOP requirements that are not required by law.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Officeof the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(d) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. An analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore: (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theundersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Since the numberof recipients that will be funded under the program will be small and willinclude both small and large recipients, HUD does not believe that a significantnumber of small entities will be affected by this program.This rule was listed as Item No. 957 in the Department's Semiannual Agendaof Regulations published on October 24, 1988 (53 FR 41974, 41989) pursuantto Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 14.179.The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review undersetion 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
