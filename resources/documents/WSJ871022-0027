But even if the crisis is over, the malady lingers on. Volatility remains a big problem and could haunt the market in the weeks ahead.    The Securities and Exchange Commission said late yesterday that it would review recent stock-market activity &quot;to determine what, if any, steps should be taken to ameliorate future market volatility.&quot; The agency also said it is continuing to monitor trading activity.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared a record 186.84 points yesterday to close at 2027.85. It was the second record-setting point advance in two days, and at 10.1% is one of the largest percentage gains in history. And yesterday most other stocks surged, too, unlike Tuesday, when just the blue-chip issues rallied.    Meanwhile, the bond market's recent rally began to slow. Government bond prices rose around 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 of face amount, as investors began to fret about the market impact of the heavy new government borrowing expected to be announced next week. The dollar again strengthened modestly against major currencies, and commodities advanced with market fundamentals reasserting themselves as liquidation pressures eased.    Stocks now have recouped more than half the ground lost in Monday's record 508-point plunge. The rebound has soothed some fears of an imminent economic disaster and cooled some of the panic that prevailed Monday. But the quick rebound hasn't eliminated and in some cases may even have intensified the worries of investment professionals about the underlying health of the market, particularly the fast-paced computerized trading that much of Wall Street has come to love.    &quot;One of the worst things that could happen now is for the market to rally fast and regain all 500 of those points,&quot; says Steve Reynolds, a top money manager at Bankers Trust Co. &quot;It would take away the sting. It would distract attention from the internal things that need to be done to our markets and the external things that need to be done in the world economy.&quot;    A primary concern for financial professionals is the way the interplay between stocks and stock-index futures -- sometimes known as program trading -- careened out of control this week. On Tuesday, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange took the unprecedented step of shutting down an automated trading system that provides the main bridge between stocks and futures. The market's recovery since then has added weight to his argument that something needs to be done about program trading.    But the gears are starting to screech in other parts of Wall Street's high-tech investment machine. The specialists, or market makers, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, are under fire for being too poorly capitalized to do much more than watch as prices gyrate. Traders report immense fatigue and stress, too. &quot;This sort of market shortens your life,&quot; says Donald Crooks, a top equities trader at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    The market's convulsions are casting a long shadow over the entire economy as well. Even if stocks recover to last week's levels, &quot;there will be an aftershock to consumer confidence,&quot; says Richard Hoey, economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Economists are already scaling back their estimates for auto sales, housing starts and the entire economy's growth next year, on the belief that consumers will feel poorer after the market's Monday plunge and will spend less. Some economists think corporate America might follow the consumers' lead.    &quot;People won't forget this volatility for many years to come,&quot; says Robert Arnott, a market strategist at Salomon Brothers Inc. It has already changed Mr. Arnott's own spending ways. When he got word of the crash Monday, he says, &quot;I canceled everything discretionary I could on the new house I'm building.&quot; He will have one patio now instead of two, and a regular driveway instead of cobblestones.    On a broader level, economists at Forstmann-Leff Associates Inc. expect that a market-induced slump in consumer spending will slash two percentage points off next year's economic growth. They are expecting growth of zero to 2% now, instead of 2% to 4%. Others have even given up trying to make accurate forecasts. Drexel's Mr. Hoey joked this week that he now revises his economic forecast hourly.    What is especially bewildering to market experts is that there wasn't any profound event that triggered the market's crash -- or its rebound. The only comparison the experts can offer is to a &quot;crisis of confidence&quot; in 1962, when the stock market skidded despite little bearish news. &quot;The difference is this time the market's moves are much greater,&quot; says David Levine, an economist at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.    And it seems clear that the moves are bigger partly because of the market's internal workings. Attention is focusing on wild gyrations in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index futures, which are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.    Asked yesterday what steps regulators might take to reduce market volatility, SEC Commissioner Charles Cox said, &quot;Some of the things I've heard proposed -- not in the commission -- are limits on options positions and in futures positions. Also, I've seen proposed price limits on futures similar to the ones on commodities.&quot;    Since stock-index futures began trading in 1982, users have argued that they help add liquidity to the market and help big institutions hedge risks. In quiet market conditions, that is probably true, agrees John Phelan, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.    But the past few days haven't been quiet. Stock prices tumbled 22% Monday, and the most actively traded futures, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's contracts on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, were down more than 30%. In the Monday panic, the futures market &quot;was the one place you could go&quot; if you wanted to sell big chunks of a portfolio at a time, says a major West Coast money manager. A torrent of sell orders pushed futures prices to huge discounts to stock prices, dragging stocks down soon afterward.    Ordinarily, such sharp swings might reverse of their own accord. But a popular hedging strategy known as &quot;portfolio insurance&quot; helped the selling pressure feed on itself.    At least $60 billion of pension-fund assets and other big institutional accounts are covered by portfolio insurance, which isn't really insurance but uses stock-index futures to hedge against potential losses. It is the epitome of Wall Street's &quot;high-tech&quot; approach to trading, where computer models decide when to buy and sell. Users have included the pension plans of Virginia, Hughes Aircraft Co. and Manville Corp.; many big banks have provided the service to clients.    When stocks are rising, portfolio insurers don't hedge and instead ride the market higher. When stocks are falling, portfolio insurers sell stock-index futures, in effect cushioning the values of their stock portfolios from the full brunt of a dropping market. The idea, according to Wall Street proponents, is to provide &quot;protection at a low cost.&quot;    In Monday's collapse, the more stocks fell, the more the portfolio insurers needed to sell stocks or futures. Such predictable, relentless selling pressure probably scared away many potential buyers from both stock and futures markets. Sellers attempted to unload an estimated $10 billion of futures contracts, enough to overwhelm even the boldest of buyers.    &quot;I don't know if Monday's drop would have been 50 points or 400 points without portfolio insurance, but it definitely made things worse,&quot; says a market analyst at a major Wall Street brokerage house.    Ironically, Monday's market rout was so severe that portfolio insurers couldn't properly enact many of their hedges. And when stocks recovered, portfolio insurers were forced to unwind their hedges at a loss. Manville Corp., for one, conceded that &quot;it's questionable how well portfolio insurance worked this week.&quot;    One investment banker predicted &quot;the end of portfolio insurance as a strategy; it's really turned out to be portfolio destruction.&quot;    Others predicted much tighter curbs on stock-index futures. The SEC's chairman, David Ruder, has already talked of setting daily limits to price moves or imposing further restrictions on the positions that big traders can take. Currently, there aren't any price-move ceilings or floors, and only loose limits on the size of positions, though most commodity futures and options contracts have such restrictions.    &quot;If stocks are going to start trading like commodities, with violent price swings, we might as well start regulating them like commodities,&quot; says Bankers Trust's Mr. Reynolds.    Unlike Tuesday's rebound, which was centered on large, blue-chip stocks, the market rallied across the board yesterday. Advancing issues led declines on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,749 to 209. The Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter trading surged more than 7%. And in the broadest measure of the market's advance, the Wilshire 5,000-stock index rose 182.711, to 2553.125, indicating that the total market value of stocks rose more than $182 billion.    A look at specific stocks shows, however, that the market hasn't yet recovered all its losses from Monday. International Business Machines Corp. stock, for example, closed yesterday at $122.75 a share, well up from its Monday close of $103.25, but below its Friday close of $135. And among smaller stocks, Information Resources Inc. rose yesterday to $20.125 a share, up from its low of $17.75 Tuesday. (Like many over-the-counter stocks, it bottomed Tuesday, lagging the blue chips' recovery.) But it is still down from its Friday close of $25.75.    A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange said the Big Board did well in handling yesterday's volume of about 450 million shares -- which was off from the two previous, 600-million-share days but was still far above a normal day.    So far, major financial players have held up surprisingly well in the market's turbulence. Mutual funds, for example, which held more than $800 billion of assets on Sept. 30 -- much of it belonging to individual investors -- have seen only limited calls for redemptions so far, and say they are meeting them easily. What's more, those investors who are pulling money out of stock funds are tending to reinvest it in money-market funds, often within the same mutual-fund group.    Wall Street's largest brokerage firms say they also have weathered the market's wild swings with little damage so far. &quot;The record volume alone is good for business,&quot; said Jack Baker, the head of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;And we made money&quot; Tuesday by trading for the firm's own account, he added.    Big problems for Wall Street firms could come on Monday, when stocks bought last Monday are actually supposed to change hands. Both the Big Board and the American Stock Exchange are considering calling people into work Saturday to help process this week's activity.    Yesterday's market rally was fueled by news of lower West German interest rates, as well as signs of a compromise in Washington on reducing the budget deficit. And many investors simply decided the stock market had overreacted Monday.    &quot;We're in America, and the country isn't going broke,&quot; said Morgan Stanley's Mr. Crooks. &quot;There are some fantastic values out there, and people are buying.&quot;    Still, the market's wild swings may cause American industry to hold back on expansion plans, fearing bad times. And such worries can become self-fulfilling. A money manager with big food-stock holdings says executives at those companies have already told their employees to cut travel and discretionary spending, as a direct, immediate reaction to Monday's market crash. Also, several takeover bids have been halted because of tumbling stock prices, including the Haft family's $6.3 billion attempt to buy Dayton Hudson Corp.    Compared with Monday's bleak outlook, &quot;there's a whole laundry list of positive things for the short-term,&quot; said Shearson's Mr. Baker. But because of the adjustments to increased volatility, &quot;there's no long term anymore.&quot;    ---               Busiest Trading Days                                       NYSE VOLUME October 20, 1987                      608,120,000 October 19, 1987                      604,330,000 October 21, 1987                      449,350,000 October 16, 1987                      338,480,000 January 23, 1987                      302,390,000 August 11, 1987                       278,130,000 April 14, 1987                        266,540,000 October 15, 1987                      263,180,000 February 5, 1987                      256,660,000</TEXT></DOC>
