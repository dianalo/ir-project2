Rebels also used rocket-propelled grenades and rifle fire in apre-dawn attack on a military engineers' base in Zacatecoluca, 35miles southeast of the capital. Radio reports said the assaultkilled three soldiers.   The rebel attack on the 1st army brigade base, which killed anelderly couple who live nearby, was the fifth since November on amajor military installation in San Salvador.   As in the earlier attacks, guerrillas used pickup trucks fittedwith a catapult-like device to launch the bombs against the 1stbrigade. The detonation of one explosive charge launches the bombsand simultaneously blows up the vehicle.   Two vehicles exploded today, killing Pedro Martinez, about 70years old, and his wife Maria Teresa, about 65.   Martinez's body lay on the sidewalk in front of his home an hourafter the vehicle parked in front of it exploded.   Mrs. Martinez, whose legs were blown off by the blast, died onthe way to the hospital, said Col. Orlando Zepeda, who commands the4,000-troop brigade. Three civilians were wounded by the explosions,Zepeda said.   The bombs launched by the vehicles did not fall inside thegrounds of the 1st brigade, he said. Journalists were denied entryto the installation to verify the report.   The explosions damaged about 10 homes, breaking windows, gougingwalls and blowing doors off hinges.   In Zacatecoluca, Marxist-led guerrillas and soldiers battled forthree hours near the headquarters of the Detachment of MilitaryEngineers, radio reports said.
