Mobil Corp. said third-quarter net rose 19%, excluding a tax gain. Texaco Inc.'s profit more than doubled, while Chevron Corp.'s earnings were up 41%. Phillips Petroleum Co.'s third-quarter net income increased nearly sevenfold.    But three others -- Shell Oil Co., Amerada Hess Corp. and Sun Co. -- said low oil prices walloped earnings from exploration and production segments, pushing third-quarter net income lower. Shell, whose third-quarter profit fell 17%, said various operations felt the effects of hurricanes, maintenance costs, and a refinery accident. Amerada Hess's 60% drop, analysts said, reflected an inventory accounting method that favors high oil prices. And Sun's 47% decrease involved the absence of a special gain a year earlier.    On the whole, major oil companies' &quot;downstream&quot; operations -- the businesses that refine and market chemicals, gasoline and other products -- benefited greatly in the third quarter from lower crude oil prices. Their &quot;upstream&quot; operations -- exploration and production -- meanwhile, have been hurt by those same low prices.    &quot;It makes a very strong case for integration, doesn't it?&quot; Bernard Picci, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., asked rhetorically.    Shell, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, pointed out that domestic crude oil prices averaged $12.20 a barrel in the third quarter, down about 28% from the $16.94-a-barrel average of the 1987 third quarter. Along with lower crude prices, consumer demand for gasoline -- especially for highly profitable enhanced-octane products -- plastics, chemicals and other refined products pushed refining and marketing profits up substantially.    Following are the third-quarter results of the major oil companies reporting yesterday:   Shell Oil Co.    Earnings decreased to $352 million from $420 million on a 5% revenue decline to $5.4 billion from $5.7 billion. Shell is still recovering from an accident in May at its Norco, La., refinery, which killed seven people and knocked out 20% of Shell's sales. The company said nearly all of the refinery units shut down by the accident returned to operation by the middle of the third quarter.    Even with the crippled refinery operations, oil-products profit was more than double that in the year ago quarter, while chemical-products profit increased 55%. But oil and gas exploration and production profits plunged to $22 million from $262 million a year ago because of lower crude oil prices and decreased production due to hurricanes and extended maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico, Shell said.    Amerada Hess Corp.    Although this New York-based oil company is primarily a refiner and would ordinarily be expected to benefit greatly from higher profit margins on refined products, it also uses first in-first out inventory accounting. That method forced Amerada Hess to record as an expense older, higher-priced barrels of oil, which, in effect, severely reduced its margins. Profit for the company fell to $15.8 million, or 20 cents a share, from $38.6 million, or 45 cents a share.    Although Amerada Hess reported an earnings decline for the quarter, its stock price rose 87.5 cents to $29.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Picchi of Salomon Brothers said he believes Amerada Hess &quot;is on the verge of announcing a gargantuan&quot; oil discovery in the Waverley field of the British North Sea. The company didn't return phone calls.    Sun Co.    Sun, based in Radnor, Pa., said its earnings decline to $72 million, or 67 cents a share, from $137 million, or $1.27 a share a year earlier, is primarily due to a $62 million windfall profit tax gain in the earlier quarter. Even without the 1987 gain, however, Sun said its third-quarter net was down 4%, while revenue was flat at about $2.5 billion.    Sun's chairman and chief executive officer, Robert McClements Jr., said the decrease was mostly because of lower exploration and production results due to lower crude oil prices. But, he added, &quot;Lower crude oil production volumes and higher exploration expenses contributed to the decline.&quot; Sun, too, reported a strong increase in its refining and marketing earnings.    Mobil Corp.    A $167 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an accounting change pushed up Mobil's third-quarter net income 69% to $557 million, or $1.36 a share, from $330 million, or 80 cents a share, a year ago. Mobil, New York, said its latest third-quarter results also include a $65 million write-down of properties in its foreign exploration and producing operations. Third-quarter revenue, Mobil said, was $13.1 billion, unchanged from the company's 1987 quarter.    Like the rest of the industry, Mobil said its refining and marketing results showed higher margins and sales volumes, its chemical operations had a record quarter and exploration and production operations had an earnings decrease because of lower crude prices.    Texaco Inc.    For its third quarter, Texaco, White Plains, N.Y., reported net income of $239 million, or 98 cents a share, up from $108 million, or 44 cents a share. Revenue for the period was down about 3% to $8.7 billion from $9 billion, primarily because of the sale of its West German subsidiary, Texaco said.    In addition to lower crude oil prices, Texaco cited the explosion and fire at the Piper Alpha production platform in the North Sea for the decline in its exploration and producing earnings. Texaco said earnings from its refining and marketing businesses and its petrochemicals businesses increased significantly.    Chevron Corp.    The San Francisco-based company reported third-quarter net income of $420 million, or $1.23 a share, up from the $297 million, or 87 cents a share, of a year ago. Revenue was down about 6.5% to $7.2 billion from $7.7 billion because of lower prices for crude oil and other petroleum products, except gasoline, Chevron said.    The company's exploration and production operations reported losses of $44 million in the period, down sharply from profit of $129 million a year ago, including a $43 million tax gain. Refining and marketing operations earned $186 milllion, more than triple the $54 million of the 1987 quarter. Chevron's 1987 results were restated to reflect an accounting change, the company said.    George Keller, Chevron's chairman, said &quot;Despite the plunge in crude oil prices, operational earnings continued to improve on the strength of our refining and marketing and industrial chemicals segments.&quot; Mr. Keller added, &quot;Gasoline prices reflected tight supplies in the U.S. during the summer driving season, along with increased consumer demand for the higher octanes.&quot;    Phillips Petroleum Co.    The Bartlesville, Okla., company said its third-quarter earnings were $215 million, or 89 cents a share, up from $31 million, or 11 cents a share, as operating profit in its refining and marketing and chemicals businesses more than doubled. Revenue for the quarter was up nearly 2% to $2.85 billion from $2.8 billion. Phillips even bucked the trend of lower exploration and production earnings because of higher natural gas volumes and certain lower costs and a $30 million pretax gain from an asset sale.    Phillips's chairman and chief executive officer, C.J. Silas, said &quot;our earnings reflect the continued strong performance of our downstream operations, as well as our successful cost-reduction efforts. Demand for our petroleum products and chemicals remains strong, allowing the continuation of unusually good margins.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
