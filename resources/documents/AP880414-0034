In the United States the fund predicts that production willincrease this year by the same 2.9 percent as it did in 1986 and1987, with a slower increase of 2.7 percent in 1989. It predictsdeclining unemployment from 6.2 percent last year to 6 percent thisyear and 5.9 next year.   Inflation in the industrialized countries is pegged at 3 percentin 1988. But in the Third World, the report says, prices paid byconsumers will go up by 46.7 percent.   Total growth in the Third World is put at 3.7 percent.   The report does not include population figures, but since ThirdWorld birth rates are high, the rise in income for each individualmay be only about half as much. For industrial countries, the newgrowth figure is 3 percent.   ``An important positive development in 1987 was thestrengthening of policy coordination among the major industrialcountries,'' says the fund's new ``World Economic Outlook.''   ``The U.S. federal budget deficit fell substantially, as diddeficits in other large countries with troublesome fiscalpositions.''   In the IMF's parlance, a country gets into a ``troublesomefiscal position'' when its government fails to collect enough taxesto cover its expenses.   The fund says the three most economically important LatinAmerican countries _ Brazil, Mexico and Argentina _ have hadserious setbacks in curbing inflation and there are signs of risingprices elsewhere. Fund officials doubt if their governments can doanything effective to stabilize their economies.   Sluggish growth in the Third World is blamed in part on aslowdown in India due to drought, and to lower pay and lessinvestment in Brazil because of rising inflation.   Growth in China, South Korea and Taiwan, on the other hand, wascalled ``particularly buoyant.''   The predictions are made on the assumption that governmentpolicies and currency exchange rates will not change.   For the major industrial countries taken as a group thepredictions include these for the years 1990 to 1992: a 2.8 percentincrease in production and a slight increase in the jobless rate to6.9 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
