Manguno (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government of Roh Tae Woo, in its clearest effort yet to distance itself from the military-backed former government of Chun Doo Hwan, appeared ready to bring charges against Gen. Chun's younger brother for embezzling millions of dollars.    A government prosecutor said Chun Kyung Hwan will be summoned today for questioning and likely will be charged this week. He said a four- or five-count indictment probably will be announced against the younger Chun and several other former officials of the Saemaul, or New Community Movement, a semiofficial rural development agency. The prosecutor said the charges in the Saemaul case likely will include embezzlement, misappropriation of funds and other alleged financial crimes.    Senior prosecutor Kang Won Il said that officials had seized ledgers showing that Chun Kyung Hwan and other leading officials at Saemaul had diverted millions of dollars from the agency.    Former President Chun last week cut short a visit to the U.S., during which he had met with President Reagan, to return to Seoul. He hasn't been implicated in the probe, but officials said investigators had located large bank accounts in the name of the younger brother's wife and other relatives.    Aides of the former president said he is most concerned by reports leaking out of the prosecutors' office that the Saemaul case is only the first of several planned investigations into the financial dealings of the Chun family and its friends during his tenure as president.    President Roh, a former general, helped put Mr. Chun in power in 1980 in a military coup. While he was picked with Mr. Chun's backing to be the ruling-party candidate, since the Dec. 16 election he has begun to disassociate himself from former President Chun.    This month, the ruling Democratic Justice Party, which Mr. Chun created but President Roh now heads, pointedly omitted several powerful figures from the Chun administration when it drew up election lists for National Assembly elections in April. Sources close to Mr. Roh say he has resisted attempts by the former president to maintain power and financial perks.    &quot;If it's disloyalty, ingratitude and disrespect for President Roh to set his own course, free of the favors sought by Chun and his family,&quot; said one new administration official, &quot;then I suppose we'll have to ask the Korean people for their opinion.&quot;    Meanwhile, despite the fact that it was President Roh who promised, and has publicly encouraged, the Saemaul investigation, questions have been raised about his own vulnerability and that of one of his cabinet ministers.    In 1982 and 1983, when many of the alleged wrongdoings at Saemaul occurred, Mr. Roh was authorized to oversee the agency as head of the Ministry of Home Affairs. In addition, the current home-affairs minister, Lee Sang Hee, was mayor of Taegu in 1983, when that city, the political base of Messrs. Roh and Chun, changed land-use regulations to allow construction of a hotel in which a Chun Kyung Hwan aide was part-owner.    The Saemaul rural development agency was begun by the late President Park Chung Hee in 1971 to develop the countryside and solidify his own political base there. Under Chun Kyung Hwan, who was named secretary-general of the agency shortly after his brother came to power, the agency has grown into a far-flung empire with a huge budget. After he was named chairman in the mid-1980s, the agency was dogged by suspicions of corruption, but public and media criticism was muted while the elder Mr. Chun was president.    The younger Mr. Chun resigned the chairmanship last year under criticism for &quot;massive waste.&quot; But he kept the title of honorary chairman, and Saemaul officials say he remained in effective control of the agency until last month. He returned from a trip to Japan a week ago to face questioning.    Last week, in what analysts said appeared to be an orchestrated campaign aided by the Roh government, allegations of wrongdoing by Saemaul officials, particularly Mr. Chun, flooded Korean publications and broadcasts. Political sources speculated that the Roh government leaked the detailed allegations to the media to stir up public pressure for an aggressive investigation.    About 200 Saemaul and government officials have been questioned about diverting funds, selling influence, extorting donations and other matters, officials said. Prosecutors are also said to be investigating charges that officials were involved in corruption or helped cover it up to protect former President Chun and his family.    &quot;The current investigation reflects the new government's determination to realize a clean government,&quot; said Prime Minister Lee Hyun Jae. </TEXT></DOC>
