The purpose of this workis to clarify the determining mechanisms of excitation of complex molecules.The changes in the fluorescence intensity of perylene and 1,4-di (benz-oxasol-2'-il)benzene (BoPBo) vapors as a function of the presence of different foreigngases and their characteristic vapor pressure as well as the kineticdependences were studied. Helium, neon, argon, krypton, nitrogen, ethylene,propane, and SF{sub 6} were employed as the foreign gases.</TEXT></DOC>
