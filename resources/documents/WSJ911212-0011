The suppliers include the agencies that provide water toabout 80% of California's 30 million people, includinginhabitants of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Under theagreement, the agencies will promote or demand suchwater-saving steps as indoor and outdoor water audits,water-efficient plumbing fixtures such as low-flow showerheads and low-flush toilets, leak-detection programs andlandscaping water conservation ordinances.</LP><TEXT>   California is heading into its sixth year of witheringdrought. The accord's backers, including Gov. Pete Wilson'sadministration, hailed it as an important drought-fightingmeasure that will save as much as one million acre feet ofwater each year. (An acre foot is 326,000 gallons.)   However, that savings would be a small drop in a ratherlarge bucket: California sops up 34 million acre feet ofwater each year. Moreover, urban and industrial users consumeonly about 15% of California's water; the rest is guzzled byagriculture. The state and various federal agencies andofficials are grappling with proposals that would reducefarmers' disproportionate share of water usage, but farmersare resisting them.   Barring deluges, agriculture's heavy water usage and thestate's relentless population growth assures that Californiawill continue to struggle with water shortages, no matter howmuch urban water suppliers conserve.</TEXT></DOC>
