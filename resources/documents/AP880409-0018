(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jimmy Swaggart and the nation's largestPentecostal denomination walked away from each other after thechurch said it was defrocking him for rejecting its punishment for``moral failure.''   Swaggart on Friday announced his resignation from the Assembliesof God shortly after the church said it was ousting him forrefusing to undergo a year's suspension from the pulpit and atleast two years of rehabilitation.   The punishment was ordered after Swaggart confessed publicly tounspecified sins. Though never proven but also never disputed, itwas widely reported that Swaggart had committed lewd acts with aNew Orleans prostitute.   A woman who said she was that prostitute said Swaggart paid her$50 a visit to pose nude for him. Another defrocked Assemblies ofGod minister, Rev. Marvin Gorman of suburban New Orleans,reportedly hired men who photographed Swaggart with the womanoutside a motel.   Swaggart, at a Friday news conference at which he refused toanswer questions, said his dismissal was inevitable but thatleaving the church was vital to save his Bible college and $140million-a-year world ministry.   ``Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to takea position that does not answer all of the questions nor solve allof the problems. But we feel we have no alternative or choice,''Swaggart said.   Asked if that meant Swaggart would form his own church, hislawyer William Treeby replied: ``This ministry is an independentchurch and always has been.''   Shortly before Swaggart made his announcement, the ExecutivePresbytery of the Assemblies of God, headquartered in Springfield,Mo., said it had dismissed him as a minister for refusing to acceptthe church's recommended punishment.   The church's decision was announced in Springfield by the Rev.G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendent of the church, after heand other members of the Executive Presbytery met by telephoneconference call.   Earlier Friday, the church had received what Carlson describedas a ``gracious'' letter from Swaggart in which the evangelistrefused to accept the church's terms. Carlson declined to releasedetails of Swaggart's letter.   The Rev. Everett Stenhouse, assistant superintendent of theAssemblies, said Swaggart's chances of returning to the church areslim. ``It would be a long trail back ... if at all,'' he said.   Swaggart voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit Feb. 21, aftera tearful public confession of ``moral failure'' before his wife,son and congregation gathered in his Family Worship Center.   He later agreed to accept a punishment originally recommended byLouisiana church officials _ a three-month suspension and two yearsof counseling _ but the national church insisted on the morestringent discipline.   Swaggart said Friday he would stick to the punishment initiallydecided by the Louisiana church officials. Under that punishment hewould not preach sermons until May 22, although he has been``witnessing'' at church services.   The scandal rocked Swaggart's Baton Rouge church, TV and schoolcomplex. About 100 workers were fired, and Jimmy Swaggart BibleCollege students and faculty are said to be clamoring to transferto other religious institutions.   Swaggart's ministry brought in an estimated $142 million lastyear, and his sermons are broadcast in more than 100 countries. Hehas been known for his harsh denunciations of the sins of others,including two other prominent Assemblies ministers brought down byscandal.   PTL founder Jim Bakker lost his Assemblies credentials after asex-and-money scandal last year. Bakker did not opt forrehabilitation.   Swaggart also was said to have been instrumental in the downfallof Gorman, who said the action Friday involving Swaggart ``furtherproves the truth of the allegations I made'' in a $17 millionlawsuit he filed against Swaggart in March 1987. In it, Gormanblamed Swaggart for destroying his ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
