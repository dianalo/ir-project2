In recent years - particularlywith the advent of the cross-sectional imaging techniques such as ultrasonography,CT, and MRI - less invasive techniques have become more important thanthe older diagnostic modalities in the diagnosis and staging of pelvicmalignancies. In addition to the advantage of being noninvasive, thesemodalities can aid physicians in determining the entire degree and extentof a patient's pathological process. Radiologists have also become moreinvolved in the management of patients with gynecologic malignanciesby performing transcatheter intraarterial infusion and occlusion, percutaneousbiopsies, aspiration and injection of cystic or necrotic neoplasms, andnephrostomy. In this chapter, the author discusses the applications ofall available imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of gynecologiccancer. The primary emphasis is on the diagnosis of ovarian and cervicalcancer.</TEXT></DOC>
