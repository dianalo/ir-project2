Grain futures followed the soybean market and ended mostly lower.   On other commodity markets, energy futures rose sharply; copperfutures surged; precious metals advanced; and livestock and meatfutures were mixed.   Soybean futures settled 4{ cents to 6} cents lower with thecontract for delivery in May down 5 cents at $6.27{ a bushel.   Wheat futures settled 6} cents lower to 2{ cents higher with Mayat $3.67{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 2{ cents higher withMay at $2.83} a bushel; oats were } cent lower to \ cent higherwith May at $1.64} a bushel.   Soybeans for May delivery touched $6.55 a bushel, the highestprice for a near-month soybean contract since July 28, before therally ran out of steam.   Analysts linked the early runup to chart patterns that indicatedto many traders that prices were likely to continue their recentstrong advance.   The upswing in prices that began about two weeks ago wasunderpinned by strong demand and relatively tight supplies, butthose factors had been known for long enough that analystsdiscounted them as a reason for Tuesday's action.   Prices peaked before noon, then fell amid heavy selling thataccelerated in the final hour of trading.   ``The buying dried up, the selling picked up and the lower yougot, the more selling you ran into,'' said Jerry Zusel, manager ofBalfour Maclaine Corp.'s grain trading operations.   The unusual volatility may have been a function of thin marketconditions due to the May Day holiday in Europe. With Europeanmarkets closed, there were fewer players in the soybean market andprices fluctuated more freely.   Oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, largely onspeculation that OPEC ministers meeting Wednesday in Geneva willagree on measures to firm up crude-oil prices.   As cartel ministers arrived Tuesday for the emergency meeting,OPEC president Sadek Boussena of Algeria said OPEC needs cut to oilproduction by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day to help crudeprices recover from their recent slide.   Crude oil values have fallen more than 20 percent since January.   U.S. supplies of crude oil and refined products fell last week,according to the weekly American Petroleum Institute stocks reportreleased after the close of trading.   The trade group reported a relatively modest decline of 473,000barrels of crude oil and steeper drops of 1.5 million barrels ofgasoline and 2.1 million barrels of petroleum distillates.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 27 centshigher with June at $18.81 a barrel; heating oil was 1.03 cents to1.52 cents higher with June at 52.97 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .85 cent to 1.19 cents higher with June at 61.03 centsa gallon.   Copper futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange,reflecting continuing concerns about tight supplies. Copper settled2.9 cents to 5.2 cents higher with May at $1.221 a pound.   Gold futures rose moderately, nearly erasing Monday's losses,while silver and platinum futures posted strong gains.
