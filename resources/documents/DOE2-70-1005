The box would have to be removedto allow normal maintenance and repair of equipment in this section ofthe corridor. It was estimated that a total exposure of 8 R would berequired to remove the box manually, even with tools mounted on longpoles. The Robotics group at the Savannah River Laboratory was askedto develop a method to remotely remove this junction box. The Roboticsgroup, with assistance from the Interim Waste group, obtained a hydrauliccutter that was capable of making the 13 cuts required to remove thebox. The cutter blades were of a special design that could cut throughthe 2-inch conduit with minimum force. A Pedsco mobile tele-operatorwas extensively modified to manipulate the cutter. A new upper arm assemblyin the elbow-up configuration was installed, a tool-mounted camera wasinstalled, and two additional degrees of freedom were added: a wristrotate and a wrist pitch. The cutter attachment was designed to allowthe cutter to be placed in three different orientations on the wrist,so that it could make all the cuts. 1 ref., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
