A spokesman for the French food group said he couldn'tdisclose the price for the transaction, beyond saying that itwould generate a &quot;substantial capital gain.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Terms of the sale will see Invus Group, a unit of theclosely held Belgian company Artal, take control of BSN'sU.S. biscuit units Mother's and Salerno. The units havecombined annual revenue of about $200 million for a 5.7%stake of the U.S. market.   Invus Group will also take over distribution of BSN's Lubrand in the U.S., but BSN will retain ownership.   BSN's move out of the U.S. biscuit market reflects itsdecision to focus on faster-growing, less-expensive marketsin Asia and Europe, where it has recently been on anacquisition binge.   The U.S. pullout doesn't extend to BSN's other U.S.operations, which include products with higher market shares,such as Dannon yogurt, Lea andamp; Perrins condiments and Evianmineral water.   BSN is France's biggest food group, with consolidated 1989revenue of 48.7 billion francs ($9.3 billion) and profit of2.7 billion francs. BSN said Invus Group generates annualrevenue of about $1.3 billion in the U.S., with a largeportion coming from baked goods. It didn't provide furtherdetails.</TEXT></DOC>
