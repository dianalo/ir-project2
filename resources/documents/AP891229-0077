SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Primate Jozef Glemp today paid tribute tolawmakers of all political persuasions during the first visit by aPoland's Roman Catholic leader to Parliament in the country'spostwar history.   Lawmakers greeted Glemp with Christmas carols. His visit wasanother sign of the changes in Poland's government sinceSolidarity-backed candidates trounced Communist parliamentarycandidates and joined with other parties to form the East bloc'sfirst government led by non-Communists.   Similar changes occurred in recent months in East Germany andCzechoslovakia, and democratic reforms have spread throughBulgaria, Hungary and Romania.   Glemp met with senators and members of the Sejm, as the lowerhouse of Parliament is called, during a break in a heated debateover amendments to the constitution and an eventual change in thecountry's national emblem.   ``I wish you enough strength for the coming year and that thelink between the nation and the Parliament will become stronger andmeet with greater understanding,'' he said.   Throughout the morning, lawmakers debated the constitutionalamendments, especially one that would eliminate a clause giving theCommunist Party the leading role in state affairs as well as aproposed change that would add a crown to the national emblem.   The package of constitutional amendments would also restore thehistorical name of the country to the prewar Republic of Polandinstead of the Communist-imposed People's Republic of Poland.   ``We shall soon say goodbye to 1989,'' said Edward Rzepa, adeputy from the Solidarity caucus. ``It seems it is the mostappropriate moment to give society a long-expected gift _ a newconstitution.''   The constitutional amendments, proposed by the Solidaritycaucus, are designed to eliminate or change sections inconsistentwith new democratic reforms until a completely new constitution canbe written.</TEXT></DOC>
