Nonetheless, because some time must still begiven over to the actual mechanics and details of the Thomasnomination itself, we think it would be useful to collect inone place the relevant sequence of events in the Hill-Thomasdispute. Herewith, a chronology.   July 1: President Bush nominates Clarence Thomas to theSupreme Court.</LP><TEXT>   July 28: An article in the Boston Globe reports: &quot;Themajor civil rights and civil liberties organizations, many ofthem led by veterans of the Bork battles, are sharingresearch and coordinating strategy. . . . The official said,for instance, that opposition groups have been withholdingsome damaging information about Thomas's record, and willtime its release to achieve maximum impact.&quot;   Early September: Kennedy Labor Committee aide RickiSeidman contacted Ms. Hill, who didn't lodge her accusationin that conversation. Then on Sept. 9, Ms. Hill said she waswilling to talk about her complaint, and Mr. Seidman referredher to Metzenbaum Labor Committee aide James Brudney, whomMs. Hill knew from Yale Law School. The next day, Mr. Brudneygave the allegations to Harriet Grant, the JudiciaryCommittee's chief nomination counsel.   Ms. Hill called the Judiciary Committee for the first timeon Sept. 12. Senator Biden said that Ms. Hill wanted herallegation kept &quot;completely confidential.&quot; Senator Biden nowsays this is what kept the staff from giving her name to theFBI or Judge Thomas then.   On Sept. 18, a friend of Ms. Hill's, who hasn't beenidentified, called the committee to offer some corroboratingsupport.   The next day, Ms. Hill called to say that she wanted allof the committee's members to know about her complaint, andlifted her anonymity request. It has also been reported thatduring this period Ms. Hill was talking to law school friendsand civil-rights activists.   Senator Biden says that on Sept. 23, Ms. Hill said thather name could be used in an FBI interview with Mr. Thomas.The FBI report was completed on Sept. 25 and that eveningSenators Biden and Thurmond agreed to let the rest of thepanel know about the allegations. Senator Biden briefed eachDemocrat orally and brought along copies of the FBI reportand of Ms. Hill's statement, if any wished to read it. OnFriday, Sept. 27, Mr. Biden gave all relevant documents toall of the committee Democrats.   On Sept. 27, the committee voted 7-7 on the nomination,sending it to the full Senate for a scheduled Oct. 8 vote. OnOct. 4, Friday, Senator Hatch predicted an attempt would bemade over the weekend to stop the nomination.   On Sunday morning, Oct. 6, the Hill allegation appeared inNewsday and in a report by Nina Totenberg on Public Radio's&quot;Weekend Edition.&quot; Interviewed on the program, Ms. Totenbergsaid: &quot;I heard about it from a number of sources. I did reachher. She refused to talk to me at all until I had obtained acopy of her affidavit. She then confirmed its authenticityand agreed to talk.&quot;   On Monday, Anita Hill held her press conference in Norman,Okla.   On Tuesday afternoon, Sen. John Danforth asked that thescheduled Senate vote be delayed.   Neither the FBI report nor Ms. Hill's statement to thecommittee have been made public. The one document released sofar, by Sen. Danforth, is Judge Thomas's telephone log,listing calls from Ms. Hill between 1984 and 1990. It readsas follows:   Jan. 31, 1984, 11:50 a.m. &quot;Just called to say hello.
