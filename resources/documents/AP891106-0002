(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tammy Faye Bakker agreed Monday to vacateher storefront church by the end of the month after the owner ofthe shopping mall threatened to sue to get her evicted.   ``Mrs. Bakker has agreed that they will be out by Nov. 30, thatthere will be no more delays, that there will be no more unforeseenproblems,'' attorney Ed Leinster said after meeting with the wifeof imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker.   The Bakkers' Orlando ministry, which has been conducting Sundaychurch services and occasional television gospel shows out of amakeshift church-studio for about four months, owed at least$73,000 in rent, said Shoppers World mall owner Stewart Gilman.   Gilman had ordered the financially strapped ministry to leavealmost two weeks ago, but Mrs. Bakker and her supporters continuedto hold services there the past two Sundays.   On Sunday, she told followers that services would continue to beheld there until the ministry found a new, inexpensive site tolease, preferably for no more than $5 per square foot.   Gilman contacted Leinster, who is his attorney.   Mrs. Bakker has vowed to continue the ministry. Her only commentMonday was, ``We're looking for a place in Orlando.''   Jim Bakker, 49, was convicted of bilking ``lifetime partners''of the now-defunct PTL of $3.7 million to support the Bakkers'lavish lifestyle. He is serving a 45-year sentence at the FederalMedical Center in Rochester, Minn.   At the service Sunday, Tammy Bakker said the ministry now facesa $500 million lawsuit brought by former PTL followers. She urgedworshipers to remain ``faithful in your tithings'' because that'sthe only way God can be expected to answer prayers for better jobs,pay raises or income tax refunds.   ``That is what God can do for you if you are faithful to him,''she said.   She said the Jim and Tammy television gospel show would remainoff the air until the ministry pays off $400,000 inproduction-related debt. No new shows have aired since Jim Bakker'sconviction.</TEXT></DOC>
