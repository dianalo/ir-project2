Sandamp;P said it placed about $400 million of Allegheny's debt on its CreditWatch for possible raising or lowering. The issues include single-B-minus senior debt, triple-C-plus subordinated debt and single-C preferred and preference stock.    The rating concern said the debt could be raised if the leveraged buyout plan results in some &quot;meaningful improvement in the firm's overall debt servicing capabilities.&quot; A negative rating would result if the plan doesn't address the company's near-term financial problems, or if the present bank agreement doesn't accommodate restructuring efforts.    Moody's placed under review for possible downgrade about $75 million of Allegheny's senior unsecured debt rated single-B-2 and subordinated debentures rated single-B-3, as well as senior unsecured issues of Allegheny's Sunbeam Corp. unit rated single-B-1. The rating concern cited large losses from continuing operations in the fourth quarter and concerns that the proposed leveraged buyout could increase financial leverage.    Allegheny officials didn't have any comment on the reviews. </TEXT></DOC>
