Simon</HL><DD> 04/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AIRLINES (AIR) </IN><TEXT>   Picture the scene: You have just received word that the president of a country you hope to do business with will be in San Diego for the rest of the day. She is willing to hear your offer before closing a big deal with your main competitor. You hop a cab to the airport hoping that there will be a seat on the last flight that will get you to San Diego on time. You run to the counter. The plane is not even boarding yet . . . but -- oh, no! -- the flight is full.    Wait. The year is 1993, and you have an option. You tell the airline clerk that you'll pay $450 to any passenger who will sell you a confirmed ticket. The clerk immediately announces: &quot;Who will take $450 for his or her seat on this flight?&quot; A young student comes forward, receives a check for $450 from the airline clerk and walks away beaming, as you give the boarding agent your credit card to pay for the student's ticket and a $50 handling charge. You grab the deal from under your competitor's nose and make back your $500 many times over. The airline clears an extra $50. Everyone wins except your competitor.    In the year 2017, the operation will go even more smoothly. Then the clerk will merely refer to the information that each passenger supplies when purchasing the ticket or checking in. The record will indicate the lowest amount each passenger will accept to wait for the next flight, in case of either an oversale or an &quot;emergency&quot; passenger without a reservation.    Such scenarios are impossible today because airline tickets are not legally transferable. Why not? Beats me. I have heard no public-interest argument -- convincing or not -- for nontransferability.    The sole potential pitfall to making airline tickets transferable is that a passenger might buy an extra ticket for a flight in the hope of selling it to an &quot;emergency&quot; passenger, not find a buyer and turn back the ticket for a refund. This could cause costly extra paperwork and an increase in no-shows. But this drawback can be circumvented simply by requiring that emergency customers be handled only after all passengers holding reservations have checked in, together with the rule that tickets are no longer refundable after check-in. (Of course, this device would not prevent transfers outside the check-in area, but neither are they prevented at present.) It is unlikely, though, that the venture would attract many speculators since the demand for emergency purchases probably would be weak.    The airlines are likely to resist the plan simply because they view it as an annoyance and as reducing the dignity of the lounge area, turning it into a bazaar. They raised the same objection before the highly successful volunteer scheme for handling oversales was introduced in 1978, and it is now clear that the concern was without foundation.    Indeed, the history of the system of handling oversold airline flights serves as a good guide to how a system for transferring tickets could work, if it depended on incentives and voluntary passenger compliance.    Under this program, which is required of all flights of 60 or more passengers departing from a U.S. airport, instead of choosing passengers arbitrarily and bumping them against their will, as in the past, the airlines must offer incentives to attract passengers with confirmed seats to wait for the next flight. Passengers -- both those who volunteer to give up their seats and those who can fly without interference -- like the scheme. And the airlines like it because it increases profits by allowing them to raise overbooking levels and still pay out less than they are required to pay to passengers who are bumped against their will. It also reduces hassles for the airlines and the chance of lawsuits.    In 1966, I suggested this scheme to the major airlines and to the Civil Aeronautics Board; in 1968, I proposed it in an article in a technical journal. But for 12 years, no airline would even try a volunteer auction for one day at one ticket counter. Ralph Nader's Aviation Consumer Action Project wanted overbooking forbidden and infractions punished -- a wholly unrealistic proposal. (Today, Mr. Nader says the volunteer plan is among the best of the consumer-protection programs.) It wasn't until economist Alfred Kahn took over as head of the CAB in 1978 and made it his first order of business that the plan went into effect.    With the success of that plan in hand, it's time to institute a similar program for the transferability of tickets. Can you hear me, Elizabeth Dole?    ---   Mr. Simon teaches business administration at the University of Maryland. In 1977 he wrote an article for the Journal proposing a voluntary-bumping plan for overbooked flights. </TEXT></DOC>
