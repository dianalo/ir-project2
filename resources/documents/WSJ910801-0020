In the U.S., gasoline was strong for the second day in arow, with futures prices surging after the American PetroleumInstitute reported a surprisingly large drawdown of threemillion barrels last week in inventories of the fuel.</LP><TEXT>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gasoline for Augustdelivery rose 2.52 cents a gallon before dropping to settleat 68.24 cents a gallon, up 1.86 cents for the day.   Gasoline's strength spilled over into other fuels in theU.S. and abroad. In U.S. futures trading, heating oil forAugust delivery rose 1.24 cents a gallon to 60.20 cents.   Yesterday was the last day of trading for the Augustcontracts, and fuels futures often turn volatile as they nearexpiration dates. But gasoline for September delivery alsowas sharply higher, settling at 65.33 cents a gallon, up 1.68cents.   The API report, released Tuesday after the futures marketsclosed, also showed a decline of 1.6 million barrels in crudeoil inventories. Crude oil prices were mostly higheryesterday, in futures trading as well as in the oil fields.   September crude was up 26 cents a barrel to $21.68. Pricesin spot markets rose a similar amount, and some refiners'field postings for the U.S. benchmark crude, West TexasIntermediate, were raised 25 cents a barrel to $20.50.   European oil prices also rose, boosted in part by thefirmer U.S. market. In European spot markets, North Seacrudes were up by 10 to 20 cents a barrel, according to DowJones International Petroleum Report. On London'sInternational Petroleum Exchange, North Sea Brent blend crudefor September delivery closed 21 cents a barrel higher at$19.74.   In London, Peter Gignoux, director of the internationalenergy desk for Lehman Brothers International, noted thatSeptember Brent closed within 10 cents a barrel of its priceof $19.84 a year ago, just before Iraq invaded Kuwait tolaunch the Persian Gulf crisis and a period of volatile oilprices. Currently, he said, &quot;both the {petroleum} productsand crude arenas are firm and healthy.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices settled higherafter conflicting weather forecasts jerked the market inopposite directions. In early trading yesterday on theChicago Board of Trade, a 30day forecast calling for normalrainfall for August pushed futures prices lower. By noon,however, several private forecasters had released predictionseliminating rain from their forecasts for the weekend. Thesoybean and corn crops, particularly in a parched centralregion of the Midwest, need rain to ensure good yields. Therevised forecasts caused many traders to cover shortpositions they had taken in the morning and pushed futuresprices up sharply. The soybean contract for November deliveryrose nine cents to $6.005 a bushel; the December corncontract climbed five cents to $2.633 a bushel; and theDecember wheat contract rose 2.25 cents to $3.083 a bushel.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices strengthened. Copper for Septemberdelivery ended 0.9 cent a pound higher at $1.013. John Gross,a metals consultant in West Nyack, N.Y., said the possibilityof a strike starting today at Codelco's El Teniente mine inChile was part of the reason for the rise but that technicalfactors also contributed. Copper prices have remained above96 cents, a level of support since 1988. Traders are alsoencouraged that demand wasn't as weak as expected in July andAugust, which are typically slow months, he added. In thepast week, copper consumers such as wire manufacturers havebeen placing bigger-than-expected orders with producers forAugust delivery, he said. The export market has beenparticularly strong this year, he added. Through April,exports of refined copper were about 120,000 tons, nearlydouble the amount shipped in the same period in 1990, hesaid. Those trends continued through the rest of the firsthalf, Mr. Gross said. Japan accounts for most of the exportgrowth: It imported 69,000 tons from the U.S. through April,more than double the 29,000 tons a year earlier, he said.Japan is the world's second largest copper consumer, afterthe U.S. Mr. Gross said he expects prices to remain firm overthe next few days.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Sugar for delivery in October surged ahead of thelater months on renewed talk about buying interest by theSoviet Union. October sugar ended 0.29 cent a pound higher at9.68 cents, while most later months declined. Rumors havecirculated since mid-July that the Soviets are seekingseveral hundred thousand tons of white sugar. Stephen Platt,vice president at Dean Witter in Chicago, said he believesthat the Soviet Union is in the market for sugar, but he'sskeptical of the rumored amounts. He said traders wereencouraged that a sale recently of about 50,000 tons ofIndian sugar was snapped up, removing supplies overhangingthe market. Judith Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch,said that when the price rose above 9.45 cents yesterday,buying based on technical factors accelerated. Producer andtrade selling are believed to have capped the rally, shesaid. The market will continue to focus on the tightness inshort-term supply caused by delays in Cuban shipments and asmaller Australian crop, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
