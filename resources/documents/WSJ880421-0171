This is a serious misreading of the treaty text.    On the U.S. side, the INF Treaty bans only ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) and the Pershing II missile. The U.S. will continue to maintain a robust fleet of air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) that, because of their range, are considered strategic weapons and therefore outside the scope of the treaty. And although it would violate the spirit of the treaty, the U.S. could develop and deploy shorter-range ALCMs for use in Europe. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, whose virtues Mr. Lubkin extols, would be permissible provided they were either air-launched or sea-launched.    Further, there are no restrictions at all on sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs), which are nearly identical to the now prohibited ground-launched version, with the important distinction that they can carry conventional warheads or nuclear warheads. If it so chooses, the U.S. simply may offset the reduction of GLCMs by increasing the number of SLCMs committed to Europe, perhaps even using the &quot;retired&quot; GLCM warheads (with only slight modifications).    Stephen Schwartz   Associate Director   Council on Nuclear Affairs   Santa Monica, Calif.   ---   Mr. Lubkin's excellent letter addressing the follies of the INF treaty ends with the untranslated Si vis pacem, para bellum. I believe he refers to a quote from a book on military science written in A.D. 375 by Flavius Vegetius Renatus: Qui desiderat pacem, praepart bellum (&quot;He who desires peace prepares for war&quot;).    Too bad that it is not inscribed on the walls of the House and Senate chambers. Rome was sacked in A.D. 410.    D.A. Liddicoat   Watsonville, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
