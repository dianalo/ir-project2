Taft IV in 1985.andP;  The original initiative was intended to move DODfrom its traditional paper-intensive environment to a &quot;largely automated andintegrated mode of operation.&quot;andP;  In August 1988, Taft ordered DOD programmanagers to require CALS standards in requests for proposals beginning infiscal 1989.andM;He also said weapons systems contractors submitting RFPs must proposealternatives to the normal paper-based way of doing business.andM;&quot;You'll see in RFPs this year CALS requirements,&quot; McGrath said.andP;  &quot;I thinkit's a reasonable expectation that some of those RFP requirements will benaive initially, and probably some of the proposals we get in response willalso be naive.andP;  We're all learning as we do this.&quot;andM;McGrath said contractors would have to start suggesting areas where DOD wouldbenefit from a specified level of access to the contractor's database,essentially creating an on-line access environment.andP;  He said contractors alsowould be asked to identify deliverables that could be submitted in digitalform.andM;&quot;We are entering a transition period from a time of engaging our supplier toapply CALS standards to one of requiring them,&quot; said Paul R. Cataldo,director of information and logistics in the Navy's technical and assessmentsdivision.andM;&quot;We will be giving some very detailed information to our program managerswhen they put out their RFP.andP;  Companies without CALS capabilities will notwin contracts.&quot;andM;McGrath said DOD is preparing for the influx of CALS-related activities bymodernizing its systems.andM;&quot;If we're going to ask industry to send us digital data,&quot; McGrath said, &quot;thenwe need to equip ourselves to receive, store, distribute and use technicalinformation on weapons systems in digital form.&quot;andM;McGrath said automation could lead to labor savings of up of 30 percent, andthe redesign of processes to take advantage of digital data also could resultin large savings.andP;  DOD faces a difficult challenge in persuading industry andgovernment to abandon their outdated paper-intensive environments in favor ofa newer, more efficient digital environment, he said.andM;&quot;There is a real cultural change,&quot; said Mary Karen Cronin, director of plansand programs for the Product Assurance and Acquisition Logistics Office atthe Air Force Command.andP;  &quot;People are used to doing [their work] on paper.andO;They are something they don't like, and they mark it up in red or blue andsend it back to the person who wrote it.andM;&quot;Now we're changing that.andP;  We're trying to look at how we can do thatdigitally, how we can use that over electronic media.andP;  It's a very differentapproach.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
