 The technical side of the operation seems to be the area in whichMotorola will encounter least problems - no new technology is being used,instead assistant general manager of satellite communications Bary Bertigersays it is more a matter of &quot;using existing technologies as building blocksin a different way&quot;.andM;77 satellitesandM;The so-called &quot;Iridium&quot; network will be composed of 77 700lb satellitesorbiting at a height of 413 nautical miles; they will be arranged into sevencircular orbits, with 11 satellites in each plane, and each satellite willproject 37 cells on the world's surface; unlike conventional cellulartelephony, these cells will span roughly 350 miles.andP;  Calls are then switchedand routed from satellite to satellite to provide instant 2,400bps digitallinks for both voice and data; the low altitude of the satellites - normalgeosynchronous satellites orbit at a height of 22,300 miles - is intended tomake for much improved connections.andP;  With Iridium, the caller's handset sendsa microwave signal carrying a phone number and serial number to a satelliteoverhead; this information is then sent via a second satellite to a basestation in the caller's home country, which then checks that the call isauthorised.andP;  If the call is allowed, the base station sends the message backto the second satellite, which then switches the call to a satellite over thecountry to which the call has been sent; finally, the third satellite relaysthe signal either directly to the handset of another Iridium user or into thepublic switched network through another base station - thus, if the servicetakes off, it will be theoretically possible to make a mobile call fromanywhere, to anywhere in the world.andP;  But Dave Bartram, senior vice-presidentof Motorola Europe, stressed that Iridium was not putting itself forward as acompetitor to conventional land-based cellular telephony or even the proposedPersonal Communications Network: its use is likely to be limited to parts ofthe world that are not covered by any of these systems, and it is aimed atusers such as government officials, business executives and engineers thatfind themselves in these remote or rural areas; alternatively, Iridium couldprovide ships and aircraft with positioning information, and could be used indisaster recovery efforts were existing communications facilities have beendestroyed.andM;By Mark JohnandM;According to Bartram, it cannot compete with land-based cellular in majorcities because it cannot project microcells to increase capacity: if cellsize becomes too small, transitions would occur too quickly for theinter-satellite switching system.andP;  Eventually, it is hoped that Iridium andother land-based cellular networks will work together to create a seamless,worldwide mobile network.andP;  For the multibillion dollar project to beeconomically viable, Bartram reckons that it must attract only 700,000subscribers worldwide, although he believes that the potential market for theservice will be much greater.andP;  Motorola plans to market the Iridium networkas part of an international consortium in which it will eventually have aminority stake - its role will be as the supplier of the system itself,including the satellites and communications components, as well as providingsystem support.andP;  Memoranda of understanding have already been signed with theInternational Maritime Satellite Organisation, Inmarsat, the American MobileSatellite Corp, and Canada-based Telesat Mobile Inc; the agreements call forthe three organisations, each of which hold licences to provide satellitecommunications, to co-operate in studying the technical and financial aspectsof Iridium.andP;  Motorola is also in discussions with British TelecommunicationsPlc and network operators in Australia, Hong Kong and Japan; Iridium islikely to be made available on a country-by-country basis followingnegotiations with the relevant governments and service providers.andM;Slight premiumandM;Both subscription to the service and call charges are, admitted Bartram, toinclude &quot;a slight premium on present-day cellular&quot;, and the Iridium handsets- slightly larger than Motorola's current cellular phones - will beconsiderably more expensive than other cellular alternatives - US estimatesput the price of a handset at around $3,000.andP;  But the cost of the service tothe user is not seen as one of the major hurdles for Iridium.andP;  US analystsare convinced that the investment required to fund the venture will vastlyexceed the initial estimate of $2,000m, as happened when IBM tried to offersatellite-based communications between fixed sites; moreover Motorola couldface competition from the likes of ATandamp;T Co, which is said to be indiscussions with other companies to provide a similar service.andP;  Otherproblems are likely to come as Motorola and its partners attempt to securelicences from international groups such as the Federal CommunicationsCommission to operate a network in the new 1.5GHz to 1.6GHz frequency.andP;  Andbecause of the large 350-mile footprint, difficulties may occur when a cellspans two countries, one of which wants the service while the other doesn't.andO;But as Olof Lundberg, director general of Inmarsat noted, the most pressingrequirement if Motorola is to start testing the service in 1992, is thequestion of spectrum availablity.andP;  To run the service, a total spectrum of10MHz is required, and Motorola and its partners will have to wait until the1992 meeting of the International Telecommunications Union to see whetherthey have been allocated this spectrum.andP;  Only then will Motorola know if itis able to go ahead with its projected first implementation of the 77satellite &quot;constellation&quot; in 1994, which is to lead to a full service by1996.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
