The sea bed platform has been used toprobe both entry pathways and undisturbed sediments. Piezocone penetrationand dissipation tests have measured no changes in sediment property dueto disturbance caused by the penetrators. The sea bed platform has beenused also for coring. Analyses of cores taken in undisturbed sedimentsand over the entry points of penetrators have found evidence that surfacesediments have been drawn downwards, but no indication that the propertiesof the disturbed sediments have been significantly affected except, inone case, in the uppermost meter of core some softening was measured.Sediments at the Antibes site have turned out to be less than perfectlyrepresentative of deep ocean sediments on at least two accounts: thegreater stiffness, the insensitivity to remolding.</TEXT></DOC>
