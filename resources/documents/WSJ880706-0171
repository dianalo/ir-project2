A clean-shaven Mohammed Ali Hamadi, the defendant, entered the courtroom in a Frankfurt state prison wearing a light blue shirt, no tie and dark blue trousers. He previously wore a beard.    Almost as soon as the trial began, Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger called a brief recess, in a dispute over Mr. Hamadi's interpreter.    The trial was later adjourned until tomorrow.    Mr. Hamadi, in his only statements on the first day of the trial, gave his name and asked for a new interpreter and the replacement of one of his defense lawyers. Mr. Hamadi said the interpreter wasn't qualified in his Arabic dialect. &quot;I don't say anything important until we have an interpreter,&quot; he said in broken German.    Judge Mueckenberger then said: &quot;I'm not going to ask you anything important, just identification. Are you Mohammed Ali Hamadi?&quot;    &quot;Yes,&quot; the defendant said loudly, before the court recessed to discuss his objections to the interpreter.    Present in the courtroom were Richard and Patricia Stethem. Their son Robert, a U.S. Navy diver from Waldorf, Md., was shot and killed during the hijacking ordeal. In addition to Mr. Stethem's parents, two brothers and one sister have submitted depositions to the court.    The court also read the names of six other Americans, former hostages aboard the TWA plane who have formally intervened in prosecuting the case, but who weren't present.    The six, who have submitted depositions and have agreed to testify at the trial if called, are Tony D. Watson of Virginia Beach, Va.; Stuart Dahl, Clinton Suggs and Kenneth M. Bowen, all of Norfolk, Va.; Jeffery J. Ingalls of New Hampshire; and Kurt L. Carlson, of Rockford, Ill.    The first five were Navy divers at the time of the hijacking.    The trial is being held in a specially built courtroom at the Preungesheim prison in Frankfurt. According to court spokesman Falk Thomas, the courtroom cost $7.5 million to construct.    Seats for 100 journalists and 80 members of the public are separated from the judges, witnesses and defendant by plates of bulletproof glass. The spectators listen through a loudspeaker system.    Four armed men hijacked the TWA plane on June 14, 1985, on a flight from Athens to Rome and forced it to land in Beirut. Thirty-nine Americans were held for 17 days and Robert Stethem was shot to death.    The Frankfurt juvenile court will look first into the vital question of Mr. Hamadi's age to determine whether he should be tried as a juvenile, young adult or adult. Under West German law, a juvenile is younger than age 18, a young adult is between 18 and 21, and an adult is 21 and older.    The West German indictment lists Mr. Hamadi's birthdate as June 13, 1964, making him 21 years old at the time of the hijacking. Mr. Hamadi also has claimed he was born in 1966. Depending on various rulings on age and maturity questions, Mr. Hamadi, if convicted, could face 15 years to life in prison.    Officials say the trial will last several months.    Last year, West Germany refused a U.S. request to extradite Mr. Hamadi to the U.S. Government sources in Bonn have said concern for the fate of two German hostages then held in Lebanon influenced their decision. The West German move angered U.S. officials and caused weeks of tension between the two countries.    Several former U.S. captives aboard the TWA plane have been asked to testify about how their abductors abused them. Dozens have given depositions to West German prosecutors about the ordeal.    Mr. Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after a search revealed he was carrying liquid explosives.    His older brother, Abbas Ali Hamadi, was sentenced in April by a Duesseldorf court to 13 years in prison for kidnapping West Germans Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes in Beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for his brother.    Mr. Schmidt was released in September. Mr. Cordes still is being held in Beirut by the pro-Iranian Holy Warriors for Freedom, a Shiite group. </TEXT></DOC>
