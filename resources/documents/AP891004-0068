But her attorney vowed an appeal, saying thefemale judge was ``madly in love'' with Hurt.   Tuesday's ruling was ``a vindication of everything I havesaid,'' the 39-year-old Oscar-winning actor said in a statement.   He said he went to court because ``I felt that I simply couldnot continually give in to the pressures that have been constantlyput on me for more and more money and other accommodations fromSandra Jennings and others.''   In an interview published today in The Middlesex (Mass.) News,Jennings blasted Judge Jacqueline Silbermann, who issued the ruling.   ``I think she was star-struck and I think she didn't use herintelligence,'' said Jennings, a native of Framingham, Mass.   Jennings, 32, based her lawsuit on four of the 10 weeks shespent with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., during the winter of 1982-83while he was there filming ``The Big Chill,'' a hit movie about areunion of 1960s-era college chums.   Common-law marriages were abolished in 1933 in New York state,where Jennings and Hurt lived, but South Carolina is one of 13states, along with the District of Columbia, that recognize suchunions.   Silbermann, of the trial level state Supreme Court, ruled thatalthough Jennings lived with Hurt and had a child with him, livingtogether did not constitute a marriage.   Jennings met Hurt in Saratoga in 1981 when he was a 31-year-oldrising star and she a 24-year-old dancer with the New York CityBallet. Less than a year later, she was pregnant.   The couple arrived in Beaufort on Oct. 31, 1982, and Jenningscontended that a common-law marriage existed between Dec. 9, whenHurt learned Mary Beth Hurt had divorced him, and Jan. 10, whenJennings and Hurt left the state.   She said Hurt resisted formalizing the union, telling her theyhad a ``spiritual'' marriage and were ``married in the eyes ofGod.''   Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, said he would immediatelyappeal the decision, claiming Silbermann was ``madly in love'' withHurt.   ``Let five judges who are all men decide this, not one woman whois impressed by a movie star,'' Golub said.   Silbermann last year presided over Golub's divorce from actressMarisa Berenson, a settlement he has said he was happy with.   Silbermann's ruling in the Hurt-Jennings case came about threemonths after a two-week, non-jury trial that was punctuated byangry outbursts, and more than five years after Jennings walked outon Hurt.   In court and in impromptu corridor news conferences, Jenningssaid Hurt was physically and emotionally abusive. She toldreporters Hurt had beaten her, spat on her and called her vulgarnames.   Silbermann's decision did not deal with financial support forJennings and the couple's 6-year-old son, Alexander Devon Hurt.Hurt pays $60,000 to $65,000 a year to Jennings and the boy. Beforethe trial, he refused to increase the amount and Jenningspetitioned for $16,000 a month, which Silbermann rejected.   Had the case gone in Jennings' favor, she would have beenentitled to a hearing and ruling on how much Hurt should give herfrom his assets _ up to half of what he has earned since the timethey were together.   In addition to ``The Big Chill,'' Hurt has starred in ``BodyHeat,'' ``Children of a Lesser God,'' ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,''``Broadcast News'' and ``The Accidental Tourist.'' He won an Oscarin 1986 for ``Spider Woman.''   Last March, Hurt married Heidi Henderson, daughter of bandleaderSkitch Henderson. They had a son, Sam, in August.</TEXT></DOC>
