Assistant HHS Secretary Robert Windom said the shift wouldenable states ``to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoringservices to more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens'family planning needs.''   In testimony to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee onhealth, Windom said certain federal requirements would be retained.Among them: a ban on use of funds for abortion-related services andpriority on serving low-income families.   Windom said that by running their own programs, states could notonly improve services but could also avoid ``burdensomeapplication, reporting and monitoring requirements in the currentprogram.''   He said legislation proposing the shift would be introduced``very shortly.''   The Title X family planning program is awarding $130 million ingrants this year to 89 groups and agencies operating 4,000 clinicsites. Last year the clinics served about 4.3 million people, mostof them low-income and about one-third of them adolescents.   The administration is trying to put strict new abortionlimitations on grant recipients, including a prohibition on anymention of the word by counselors and requirements for separaterecords, staffs and physical facilities for groups or hospitalsthat provide abortions as well as family planning.   The regulations have been enjoined by courts in Boston, Denverand New York as a result of lawsuits charging they areunconstitutional. Windom said HHS regional offices have beeninstructed for the time being not to implement them.</TEXT></DOC>
