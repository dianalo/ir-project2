Fitting because Panama is the site of the Canal, whose development under President Theodore Roosevelt is one of this country's grandest achievements. Now, more than 80 years later, a functionary from the Department of State is shuttling back and forth from Washington, plea-bargaining with a Panamanian thug named Manuel Noriega.    As described in reports yesterday the deal runs like this: General Noriega would leave Panama until next May's elections if the U.S. dropped its drug indictment against him. The U.S. would say it officially &quot;recognizes&quot; the presidency of the fellow Noriega kicked out of office, who is now hiding somewhere in Panama. Until next May's election, the country would be run by the guy Noriega recently installed as &quot;president&quot; of Panama. Then after the election, Noriega could return. Also, he could come back on holidays.    Maybe Manuel Noriega will buy the deal and go on a little vacation. Whatever its outcome, this &quot;negotiation&quot; has been the most embarrassing spectacle for the United States. It is also the logical ending point of the path American foreign policy has been on for years.    California's Senator Alan Cranston was on television yesterday morning saying the Noriega affair has been a &quot;foreign-policy embarrassment for the Reagan administration.&quot; He should talk. Mr. Cranston has been a member of the U.S. Senate since 1968. He and those who have served with him in Washington are as responsible for this mess as anyone.    In the wake of Vietnam and through various difficult decisions since then, the U.S. political establishment has endlessly debated using military force in support of policy goals. Should we or shouldn't we? Under what circumstances? Is it &quot;proportionate&quot;? Does it conform with the Weinberger Doctrine? A Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis, is running for President as an unapologetic proponent of the notion that military force must defer to the rule of international law.    The actual terms of these debates are largely beside the point now. What matters is that the arguments against force have run nonstop for years, buttressed by congressional actions -- votes barring U.S. military advisers in El Salvador, the Senate leak of the Corinto Harbor mining, votes explicitly prohibiting Defense Department or U.S. intelligence involvement with the Contras, almost an entire year spent denouncing the Iran-Contra deal. The real danger in all this is that someone would conclude that U.S. power was a bluff.    Our view is that the Russians and Cubans figured this out some time ago, which is why, despite Mr. Reagan's occasional speeches, they never hesitated to pour advisers and war materiel by the ton into Nicaragua. They calculated correctly that the likelihood of the 82nd Airborne ever getting off the ground was about zero. Finally, the Sandinista Directorate, reassured by Jim Wright's defunding of the Contras, called the Americans' bluff and announced it would talk to the opposition. The Sandinistas are now &quot;negotiating&quot; with a handful of Contras who all the world knows are backed up by nothing.    General Noriega is now dealing with a country that announced, prior to the negotiations, that it had ruled out the use of force against him. Journal reporter Frederick Kempe aptly described one result in yesterday's paper: &quot;In President Reagan's battle to oust General Manuel Noriega from Panama, the soldiers are lawyers, the battlefields are courtrooms and the result is confusion.&quot;    The real issue here is not merely General Noriega; it is the continuing credibility of a major power. The rule of law, whether international or domestic, is credible only to the extent that it is enforceable. The Colombian drug lord, Carlos Lehder, didn't come voluntarily to a U.S. courtroom. He stood trial here because he was captured after a shootout in the Colombian jungle. Then the rule of law prevailed.    In recent years, much of Washington, especially in Senator Cranston's Congress, has somehow convinced itself that constantly repudiating U.S. military action would have no consequences. That somehow good intentions, such as the Contadora process or the Arias plan, would secure the nation's interests. Governor Dukakis says that if elected, his policy will show deference to the Rio Treaty.    Unless some future U.S. President sustains a strong, credible alternative to this muddled thinking, the world, especially in Latin America, will become an increasingly dangerous and less free place as the Noriegas, Ortegas, Castros and Lehders conclude that the game is being played by their rules alone. </TEXT></DOC>
