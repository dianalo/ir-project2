Herrington, the U.S. energy secretary, of oil exporters' efforts to prop up prices by cutting production.    Arriving at a joint meeting of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members and non-OPEC producers last night, Mr. Hernandez told reporters: &quot;I can't really understand why Secretary Herrington made such aggressive attacks against OPEC, because OPEC is not against anybody.&quot;    Mr. Herrington had accused Mr. Hernandez of trying to establish a &quot;world OPEC,&quot; an effort the U.S. official said was &quot;doomed to failure.&quot;    Mr. Hernandez said last night he doesn't believe that it is against &quot;the national interest&quot; of the U.S. to establish &quot;a rational level&quot; for oil prices. He declined to specify what that level might be.    &quot;The U.S. is the nation with the highest cost of (oil) production,&quot; Mr. Hernandez said, &quot;and production is falling.&quot;    He said proven reserves in the U.S. have declined in the past three or four years and said U.S. production has slipped by a million barrels a day since 1985. Mr. Hernandez said a stable oil market would benefit everybody, including consumers in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
