Mr. Trejo and other Mexican authorities say the law of supply and demand is winning out over the 1986 U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act even though jobs are going begging in northern Mexico.    &quot;There's a tremendous need for workers in Juarez,&quot; Mr. Trejo says, referring to the booming foreign-owned assembly operations that have created a demand for workers. &quot;We want people to come so they can go to work.&quot;    But Jorge Bustamante, director of the Tijuana-based Northern Border College and a leading critic of the immigration law, wrote in a recent newspaper column that, &quot;The undocumented migrants continue entering the United States as if there never had been&quot; a new immigration law.    The law's supporters say its intent is to help the U.S., &quot;regain control of its borders.&quot; But U.S. Ambassador Charles Pilliod Jr. said in mid-May that the &quot;law was not conceived to eliminate the movement of Mexican workers&quot; to the U.S.    &quot;The United States needs these workers -- not only in the farm area, but also in the many service sectors,&quot; Mr. Pilliod said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City.    The law gave legal status to aliens who were able to prove they lived in the U.S. at least since 1982. In doing so, they were assured of such rights as a minimum wage, health care, and education.    Those who entered the U.S. after 1982 without legal documentation remain subject to deportation, but Mr. Pilliod says predictions of mass deportations are unfounded. &quot;Granted, the Border Patrol will continue to apprehend and return undocumented aliens to their home countries as always, but there are no plans for mass roundups,&quot; he says.    Mr. Bustamante and others say the U.S. can't reverse a 40-year trend with a law, because working in the U.S., without documents if necessary, has become part of the life style of thousands of Mexicans.    The immigration law gave illegal immigrants who met certain requirements until May 4 to apply for legal status in the U.S. A majority of the more than 1.6 million people who applied are Mexican. U.S. immigration officials estimate at least half of the six million to seven million illegal immigrants in the U.S. are Mexican.    Mexicans who go to work in the U.S., even those taking the most menial jobs, can earn five to 10 times what they earn at home, where the minimum wage is estimated at $3.45 a day.    Northern Border College estimates Mexicans in the U.S. generate about $1 billion in foreign income for Mexico.    A key intent of the immigration law is to stop the hiring of illegal immigrants. In the toughest provision of the law, employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers can receive stiff fines and other sanctions. Agricultural employers have until Dec. 1 before sanctioning begins.    But the crossings continue.    &quot;The majority of those who cross here are farm workers and they've been given special considerations,&quot; says Mayor Ernesto Gomez Lira of Reynosa, south of McAllen, Texas.    Messrs. Trejo and Gomez say their cities have programs to help returning migrants find work and housing, but with the continuing flow of workers to the U.S., the programs haven't been necessary. </TEXT></DOC>
