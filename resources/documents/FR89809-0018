L. 100-407). The Act is based upon the findingthat advances in modern technology can enable some persons with disabilitiesto have greater control over their own lives, to enhance their participationin education, employment, family. and community activities, and to otherwisebenefit from opportunities that are commonly available to individuals whodo not have disabilities. Title I of the Act, the subject of these finalregulations, authorizes financial assistance to States to help each Statedevelop a consumer-responsive, statewide program of technology-relatedassistance for individuals with disabilities. The regulations incorporate the seven statutory purposes of the programand provide that a State must address each of these purposes in its consumer-responsive,comprehensive statewide program. The regulations further provide that,in accordance with the statutory requirements, the Governor must designatea single responsible entity to apply for a grant and administer the activitiesunder the grant, and must designate a public agency to receive and disbursethe funds and maintain fiscal controls. From time to time, the Secretary will publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> requesting applications for development grants.In an application for a development grant, a State must provide, amongother things, a preliminary assessment of its need for technology-relatedassistance and a description of its existing efforts to establish a consumer-responsive,comprehensive statewide system for the delivery of technology-related assistance.Each State must also state the goals and objectives of its proposed programunder the development grant. A development grant will be awarded for athree-year period. The Secretary will refer complete applications to one or more groups ofexpert peer reviewers, which will evaluate the applications according tothe selection criteria in andSection; 345.31. The Secretary will seek theinvolvement as members of the peer review panels individuals with disabilities,family members of individuals with disabilities, and others who have expertise,by reason of training or personal experience, in such areas as the provisionof technology-related services or assistive devices; public administration;development and implementation of public systems; evaluation of servicedelivery programs; education, training, and public information; developmentand maintenance of information systems; provision of services to individualswith disabilities and their families; health care and benefits administration;use of assistive technology; and other relevant and appropriate areas.The selection criteria for applications for development grants, which aredetailed in the regulations at andSection; 345.31, include the extent towhich a State: demonstrates a comprehensive assessment of the need fora statewide, consumer-responsive program; presents measurable goals andobjectives that address the stated needs; presents a plan of activitiesthat is likely to accomplish the goals and objectives; presents an adequatemanagement plan, including staffing, resource deployment, and coordination;presents an adequate plan of evaluation; describes substantive roles forindividuals with disabilities or their families or representatives in thedevelopment and implementation of the State's program under the grant;and describes extensive coordination among appropriate State, public, andprivate agencies in all phases of the project. In the third year of its development grant, a State may apply for an extensiongrant. In its application for an extension grant, a State must includea followup needs assessment and a description of the activities and accomplishmentsunder the development grant. States are required to collect data and documentthe extent to which they have made progress toward the goals specifiedin the application for the development grant. An application for an extensiongrant also must include an assessment of the degree of satisfaction ofindividuals with disabilities, their families or representatives, publicand private service providers, employers, and other appropriate individualswith the activities under the development grant and with their involvementin the development and implementation of the statewide program of technology-relatedassistance under the grant.The Secretary may award extension grants to States that have made significantprogress under the development grant. Applications for extension grantswill be evaluated based on the application that is submitted and the Secretary'sassessment of the extent to which the State made significant progress towardachieving the goals and objectives under its development grant. The regulations provide that the Secretary will base the assessment ofprogress on the results of a site visit to the State's program and thedocumentation of progress the State has presented in its extension grantapplication. The rules clarify the obligations of a grantee with respect to fiscal accountability,reporting, and cooperation with the Secretary in the discharge of the Secretary'sresponsibilities under this program. Finally, the rules outline the penalties to which a State may be subjectif it violates the requirements of this part. There are no program-specificappeals procedures in this part because general Department of Educationprocedures governing the withholding and recovery of funds apply to anyState that is found to be in noncompliance with the requirements of thisprogram as a result of a site visit or failure to supply relevant informationthat the Secretary requires. The Department of Education's responsibilities under this Act will be administeredby the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR),created under Title II of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended byPub. L. 95-602, 98-221, and 99-506. The administration of the program willbe governed generally by the Education Department General AdministrativeRegulations (EDGAR), with certain specific exceptions. In specifying theregulations that apply to this program, the Secretary has excluded 34 CFR80.32(a) and 34 CFR 80.33(a) because the statute specifically encouragestransfer of title to equipment and supplies, and andSection; 75.618 becausethe statute authorizes grantees to lease equipment. On April 12, 1989, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for this program in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> at 54 FR 14773. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, the Department received20 letters of comment. An analysis of the comments and of the changes inthe regulations since the publication of the NPRM is published as an appendixto these final regulations. Technical and other minor changes_and suggestedchanges the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicablestatutory authority_are not addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the Order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification </ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these regulations would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Because theseregulations would affect only States and entities designated to act onbehalf of States, the regulations would not have an impact on small entities.States and State agencies are not defined as ``small entities'' in theRegulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review </ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the Order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 345 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Education, Educational research,Grant programs_education, Handicapped, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 5, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.

The NPRM referred to the inclusion of individuals who had experiencewith ``personal use of assistive technology.'' It is the general policyof NIDRR and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services(OSERS) to include consumers who have disabilities or members of theirfamilies in the peer review of applications. In accordance with this policy, the Secretary intends to seek the involvementof individuals with disabilities, or a family member of an individual withdisabilities, in the peer review panels, and has noted this intention inthe preamble to the regulations. The Secretary agrees that the involvementof persons with disabilities in the review of the applications for thisprogram is important. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.Definitions<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that the regulations shouldinclude the statutory definitions of several important terms, so as toemphasize those definitions and call them to the attention of the public.<T3>Discussion: </T3>It is not the practice of the Department to repeatstatutory definitions in the regulations because to do so would be redundant.The regulations are meant to be used in conjunction with the statute andother regulations, and not to stand independently of them.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One group of commenters requested that the Departmentclarify in the regulations such issues as ``what is a consumer-responsive,comprehensive statewide system'' and ``how does a State develop such asystem.''<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Department believes that the legislation was framedto give States considerable flexibility in designing and implementing systemsthat would be appropriate for the individual States. The Secretary believesthat the Department should not limit this flexibility by imposing restrictiveregulatory requirements about what such a system should be, or how a Stateshould go about developing such a system. The Secretary believes that theregulations emphasize the elements of a proposed approach that would beimportant, including the involvement of individuals with disabilities andthe involvement of a range of public and private agencies.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Selection Criteria<T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters remarked on the weights given to variouscriteria in the evaluation of applications for grants. While there weremany different suggestions for how the criteria should be weighted, therewas a general consensus that the weights accorded to ``Needs assessment''and ``Goals and objectives'' were excessive because the statute authorizesthe conduct of a needs assessment as one of the activities to be supportedunder the grant. At the same time, many commenters argued that criteriaemphasizing the inclusion of individuals with disabilities and coordinationamong agencies were undervalued. A number of commenters also stated thatmore weight should be given to the quality of the evaluation plan. Onecommenter urged that the provision of devices and training in the use ofdevices were critical elements of the program, and that these elementsshould be reflected in the selection criteria.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that there are a number ofreasonable approaches to evaluating applications under this program andthat there is considerable merit to increasing the emphasis on the roleof persons with disabilities, the evaluation plan, and coordination inthe selection of applications, and to decreasing the weight attached tothe needs assessment and goals. The statute authorizes grantees to conductneeds assessments with grant funds, and it is probable that the preliminaryneeds assessments included in the original grant applications will be cursoryand based on estimates. Therefore, the Secretary agrees that it is notreasonable to assign a large weight to these assessments in the evaluationof the applications. Similarly, a State's goals and objectives would beexpected to change based on the results of the needs assessment; therefore,it is not prudent to assign great importance to what may be only interimgoals and objectives.However, the Secretary would like to emphasize that the intent and structureof the program is to give each State an opportunity to improve on its currentsystem of technology-related assistance. In the evaluation of whether individualStates have made significant progress and thus should receive extensiongrants, the Secretary will assess the extent to which each State has metthe State's needs. It is important, therefore, that the applicants provideas much detailed information as possible about goals, objectives, and theneeds that are to be met, so that the Secretary will have baseline informationfrom which to judge the extent of a grantee's progress for the purposeof making future awards.The Secretary believes that the grantee's evaluation plans are criticalelements in maintaining program accountability and in enabling both thegrantee and the Government to assess the progress made under the grant.The statute does not require each State to provide devices or training,but permits the States to select from a range of options those that wouldbe most appropriate for a given State in developing a program to accomplishthe purposes of the Act. Thus, the Secretary believes that there is nostatutory basis for using the selection criteria to require the Statesto provide devices or training.<T3>Changes: </T3>The points assigned to ``Needs assessment'' and ``Goalsand objectives'' have been decreased to 10 and 15 respectively. The pointsassigned to ``Inclusion of individuals with disabilities'' have been increasedto 20; the points assigned to ``Evaluation plan'' have been increased to15; and the points assigned to ``Coordination'' have been increased to15.Use of Funds<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the funds under the Act mustbe used for the purchase and distribution of devices, while another contendedthat a limit should be set on the percentage of funds that could be usedfor those purposes so as not to deplete grant funds with benefits to onlya small number of individuals.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary understands both concerns. On the onehand, many individuals with disabilities and others are concerned thatthere are insufficient funds for the acquisition of technology devicesand would like to assure that this program results in tangible benefitsby providing devices. Conversely, others are concerned that emphasis onacquisition and distribution of devices could result in benefits to relativelyfew individuals, without any significant changes in the overall systemof providing technology-related devices and services to persons with disabilities.Both the purchase of devices and the development of a technology systemare authorized by the statute. The Secretary believes that there is nobasis for imposing either of the limitations suggested.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Services to All Ages<T3>Comment: </T3>A few commenters asked that the regulations clarify thatthe States must create systems that provide technology-related servicesfor children and adults of all ages, with all types of disabilities ofall levels of severity.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section two of the Act clearly states that the purposeof the Act is to provide financial assistance to States to help each Stateto develop and implement a consumer-responsive statewide program of technology-relatedassistance for individuals of all ages with disabilities. The statute doesnot address the issue of severity of disability, and thus the Secretaryhas no basis for imposing a regulatory requirement on the States that theymust provide devices and services for individuals with all levels of severityof disability. However, the statute does imply that States are expectedto identify the teohnology-related needs of all individuals in the States,to project the costs of meeting the needs of all individuals in the Stateswho could benefit from technological devices or technology-related services,and to provide a plan for meeting the identified needs.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Administration <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned why andSection; 345.4 refers tothe need for a Governor to designate an agency to administer that programand a public agency to administer the funds. The commenter questioned whetherthese could or should be the same agency. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The statute permits the Governor of a State to designatea private agency or entity, as well as a public agency, to develop andsubmit the application and conduct the program, but requires that the agencydesignated to receive and manage the funds be a public agency. If the Governordesignates a public agency to make the application, then the Governor maydesignate the same agency for both purposes. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that the provisions of andSection;345.20 be amended to permit voluntary agencies to hold title to devicespurchased with program funds. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The statute provides that title to these devices mustbe held by the individual with a disability or by a public agency. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requested that the term ``not disabled''be substituted for ``nondisabled'' in andSection; 345.11. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees that this change is an improvement.<T3>Changes:</T3> Section 345.11 has been revised accordingly. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the statement in the preamblethat the States must address each of the seven purposes of the State grantsprogram stated in Section 2(b)(1) of the statute. This commenter argued that some of the purposes might not be relevant tothe needs in a given State. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The statute requires that the State programs addressall of the purposes described in section 2(b)(1) of the Act. Each of thosepurposes is stated in terms of increasing awareness, availability, or likelihoodof receiving devices and services. The purpose of the program is to assistStates to improve along all of these dimensions. However, there is no requirementthat a State implement separate activities to address each purpose, orthat it devote specific resources to each purpose. It is conceivable thatthe analysis of needs will demonstrate conclusively that no resources shouldbe expended for a given purpose. In that situation, of course, the applicationwould not include a plan for such unnecessary spending. The purpose willhave been addressed and unnecessary spending will not take place. <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Description of Prior Activities <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned why the regulations state, inandSection; 345.11, that a State may provide a description of relevant activitiesduring fiscal year 1987 as an activity under the grant. This commenter believed that the regulations should authorize descriptionsof selected activities over a number of different years, rather than acomprehensive description of one fiscal year. <T3>Discussion:</T3> In describing the statewide needs assessment thatis authorized under the program, Section 101(c)(2) of the Act specificallyrefers to ``* * * a description of efforts during the fiscal year endingbefore the date of the enactment of this Act * * *'' <T3>Changes:</T3> None. Repair and Maintenance <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that the regulations should placemore emphasis on repair and maintenance of assistive devices, as referredto in the Act in the definition of ``assistive technology service.'' Thecommenter specifically requested that repair and maintenance be emphasizedin andSection; 345.10 of the regulations. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The definitions in the Act are incorporated into theregulations by reference. The regulations are designed to implement thestatute, and the only reference to repair and maintenance is in the definitionssection of the statute. Because the Act authorizes all of the activitiesincluded in the definition of ``assistive technology service'', the Departmentexpects that States will include repair and maintenance in their activities.However, the statutory definition also includes many other activities thatare equally as important as repair and maintenance. The Secretary doesnot believe it is practical to mention each of these activities in theregulations. At the same time, there is no justification for providingadditional emphasis to repair and maintenance. Further, andSection; 345.10 of the regulations specifically implements Section101(b) of the Act, which does not make reference to repair and maintenance.Therefore, it would not be appropriate to refer to repair and maintenancein that section of the regulations. Repair and maintenance of assistive devices are critical to a technologyservice system. However, the statute permits each State to determine theextent to which its programs under the grant should emphasize these activities.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18508 Filed 8-8-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
