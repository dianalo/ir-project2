Surrounded bywrinkled men, the formal attire makes him look even youngerthan his 12 years; his tanned face is choirboy sweet.   Jay Bonin, one of the stronger chess players in New York,is first to notice. &quot;Why so dressed? Dressed to kill,&quot; hehoots. &quot;Bobby Fischer never dressed like that.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Jorge sits down at a chess table. He pushes the whiteking's pawn forward, and in motions that are almost too rapidfor the eye to follow, his arm begins to pump like a pistonbetween the pieces and the chess clock, which must be punchedafter every move.   Even at the board, the young Honduran is a study in bodylanguage, his eyes darting, his elbows nervously shifting. Heis slight, with curly black hair and slender, gracefulfingers.   Jorge's opponent, Russ Garber, a senior master and theclub's vice president, is old enough to be Jorge's father andgood enough, most often, to beat him. Knights, bishops,queens -- all go quickly to slaughter. Jorge and Russ areplaying speed chess, a fast-forward contest in which eachplayer must make all of his moves in five minutes. With theclock ticking, with only a pair of pawns to Russ's rook,Jorge is seemingly lost. But, suddenly, it becomes apparentthat one of Jorge's pawns will queen. Astonishingly, he hasused only one minute of his allotted five.   Still, one isn't prepared for the postgame wrapup. &quot;Allthe great talents have tactical ability. I'm impressed by hisstrategic understanding,&quot; Mr. Garber says. &quot;He is on a parwith the all-time chess immortals at this age. Capablanca.Fischer.&quot;   No one can say whether Jorge, like so many prodigies --like the hard-throwing baseball phenom who wakes up onemorning with a stiff arm -- will prematurely fade. But at hisage, no one else in the U.S. is ranked as high, and few haveever been as good.   What's more, Jorge is fresh news. Unlike the highlytalented, expertly trained young Soviet players, who areemigrating to the West in droves, Jorge burst onto the scenefrom a country with scant chess tradition, and without thebenefit of a top-level teacher. He learned from his father, arestaurateur in Tegucigalpa.   Mr. Zamora used to play with Jorge's older siblings. WhenJorge, the youngest of five children, saw them, &quot;he would cryand throw the pieces.&quot; To mollify him, Mr. Zamora taught hisfive-year-old son the moves. In six months, the tantrumsbehind him, Jorge was giving simultaneous exhibitions togroups of Honduran children.   At age 8, Jorge tied for first in the under-10 worldchampionship in Romania. (A band was supposed to play thenational anthems of the winners, but no one knew the Hondurananthem.)   The elder Zamora, doing what he could, sold his restaurantand opened a chess school. But last September, the familymoved to New York. &quot;I'm here for the chess of Jorge,&quot; hesays.   At first, they played for small change in WashingtonSquare Park. But they were turned off by its seediness. Nowit is hand to mouth; one tournament's prize pays expensestoward the next. His father says he is looking for a job, agreen card, and -- fondest hope -- a patron for Jorge. Theywould be gone from New York were it not for an offer ofliving space from Nagib Gebran, an Egyptian-American who wasbeaten by Jorge and then, apparently, smitten by him. &quot;Godsent me Nagib like an angel,&quot; Mr. Zamora says.   I took young Jorge out for a bite. His father anxiouslyinquired where we were going; Jorge is not yet permitted togo about town alone. Wolfing down lasagne and fruit punch, hesaid his goal was to be world champion by 20. True to hisage, he answered each question with a minimum of words. Yes,he has been to the Empire State Building. No, he does nothave many friends in the sixth grade. (The principal at P.S.139 said Jorge gets along with the others fine, but addedthat he has missed a lot of days.)   Jorge, who speaks English haltingly, brightened when Iasked whom he most admired. &quot;Fischer and Tal,&quot; he said,picking two famous attackers, both former world champions.&quot;When I have the chance, my game is to attack. But sometimes,when I think I've won, I play too quickly.&quot;   That evening both of us played in a club tournament. Theelder Mr. Zamora alternated between reading his ever-presentBible and watching his son. &quot;We pray every afternoon, isn'tthat so, Jorge?&quot; After some prodding, Jorge said it was so.   Young Zamora was assigned the board next to mine. Sign ofyouth -- he searched his opponent's face for a reaction aftereach move. His attention seemed to wander, but he won easily.My own game was drawn. Before I could spring a question onhim, Jorge blurted out that I could have won by following acertain chain of moves, which he recited from memory. Who,exactly, had been watching whom?   &quot;He loves to play. He's not being pushed,&quot; says ShernazKennedy, one of the club's strong women players. &quot;But heneeds a good trainer -- and fast.&quot;   Impatience, as he says, may be his worst flaw. NeilBasescu, a master who beat Jorge twice in six months, says:&quot;For most of our second game he outplayed me, but he made oneserious mistake, the kind you would expect from a12-year-old.&quot; But his game so improved from one match to thenext that Mr. Basescu was in awe.   Jorge is already a master, with an official rating of 2272(2200 is master level). The next big step is makinggrandmaster. Perhaps the biggest question is how his blithespirit will endure when, inevitably, he discovers thepeculiar burdens that come with being a prodigy.   Joel Benjamin, a 27-year-old American grandmaster who wasthis country's best hope in the late '70s, says: &quot;People hedoesn't know will come up and give him advice. He will runinto petty jealousies. And he may improve steadily from yearto year and find there is less attention paid to him&quot; as hegets older. Then, there is the burden of being compared withFischer, who was U.S. champion at age 14.   The burden is unfair, but unavoidable, because prodigiesfulfill a need that is basic to the game. Being lessarticulate than adults, they seem to be playing more frominstinct and thus link the game to genius. &quot;It's a mysteriousthing,&quot; says William Lombardy, a grandmaster and earlysparring partner of Fischer's who believes that Jorge willindeed become a grandmaster. &quot;Everyone can recognize theirtalent. But how far will he go? In music you can sort of seeit earlier. In chess, only years later do we see.&quot;   ---   Mr. Lowenstein is a reporter in the Journal's New Yorkbureau.</TEXT></DOC>
