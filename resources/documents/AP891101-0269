Association members have lauded natural gas as an answer toproblems surrounding oil, mainly foreign imports and environmentalworries.   Much attention has been paid to various programs using naturalgas, especially as a replacement for gasoline in powering vehiclesand for co-generation of electricity, areas Watkins highlightedWednesday in an industry he said was ``really on a roll.''   ``Twelve years ago, in DOE's formative years, natural gas wasviewed as a scarce and dwindling resource,'' Watkins said. ``Todaywe know natural gas can be a clean-burning, domestically abundantfuel.''   He said the department estimates that the nation has a 35-yearsupply at prices of $3 per thousand cubic feet.</TEXT></DOC>
