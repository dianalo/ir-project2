LloydBentsen Thursday night.   My friends, George Bush and I have had our battles but we've beenon the same side too _ as far back as 45 years ago. We were bothyoung men, bomber pilots, defending the cause of freedom. There'snothing like the first puffs of anti-aircraft fire to teach a flightcrew about the need to work together.   Tonight, we're together again. Democrats and Republicans maydisagree on tactics. But we have the same destination in mind _ astrong, free, prosperous America.   There's a lot we can do together. Because we have worked as ateam, America is stronger militarily. President Reagan achieved amajor nuclear arms reduction treaty. That's good.   My old colleague, the late Scoop Jackson, once said that inforeign policy ``the best politics is no politics.'' I agree.Democrats won't play politics with matters of war and peace.Remember: that military build-up was enacted with lots of Democraticvotes. Democrats know how to work as a team. We've done it.   That doesn't mean we won't disagree. There'll be sharp,principled disagreements among Democrats and Republicans over one ofthe greatest challenges America has ever faced.   Because today our great industrial heartland is under attack. Notfrom foreign military forces. From new technology. From foreigncompetition _ often from our allies.   You see the evidence everywhere. You see it in ships pulling upto American docks loaded not with immigrants but with Volkswagens.You see it in the living rooms of America _ in those VCRs so many ofyou tonight have sitting beside the TV set. None of those VCRs aremade in America _ not one! It's all very well to say: read my lips.Japanese computer companies tell customers: read my chips. It'seffective; even the Pentagon buys Japanese microchips.   The result? We're losing good jobs. And that hurts the veryfabric of America. A few months ago, in Dawson, Ga., after twoplants closed wiping out 2,000 jobs, a high school class was askedwhere they would settle after graduation. Only two out of 20 wantedto stay in Dawson. At the beginning of this decade our workers hadthe highest average income in the world. Today that distinctionbelongs to the West Germans and the Japanese.   Is it inevitable that we lose to Japan _ or the other Pacific rimcountries? Or Europe united by 1992? Should kids growing up inDawson, Ga., settle for a second-class economy dependent on thegoods of others?   I don't buy that. America is a country of great strength. We cantake charge of our economic future.   But to do that we're going to have to be more productive. Youcan't have a vacuum tube outlook for the age of microchips. We'llhave to get tough with those countries whose trade practices areunfair _ we deserve a level playing field. And we'll have to facesome hard facts.   Example: Under the last administration we became the largestdebtor nation in history. Last year our trade deficit was $150billion. That's cost us 500,000 manufacturing jobs.   Example: The last administration rolled up more debt than everyadministration from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined. Thisyear one out of every seven federal dollars _ another $150 billion _will go just to pay interest on that debt.   We don't oppose foreign investment. But why should the money fromaverage taxpayers go to pay off bonds owned by rich bondholders,whether from Tokyo _ or Palm Beach? How can we stay competitive _how can we even preserve Social Security _ when we saddle ourselvesand our children with such a debt? It's like putting lead weights onMichael Jordan's legs and asking him to slam dunk anyway.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
