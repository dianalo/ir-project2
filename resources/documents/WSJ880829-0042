Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX MON ECO </IN><TEXT>   Eight months ago the weakened U.S. dollar had equity investors worried. The fear was that the dollar's three-year decline against other major currencies was going to continue and even turn into a free fall.    Yet today the resurgent dollar is riding a crest of world-wide demand that has pushed it sharply higher despite the concerted efforts of the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks to stop it. Since last December, the dollar is 17% higher against the mark and has risen 7% against the Japanese yen.    Several factors have combined to push the dollar higher. The trade deficit clearly began to narrow this year, easing fears that the dollar would have to fall further before producing a turnaround in the trade situation. At the same time the Federal Reserve, in its efforts to head off inflation, has tightened the monetary reins, pushing interest rates higher and attracting foreign capital to the more lucrative returns in the U.S. money market.    Market analysts argue that the dollar's strength has been good for stocks because it has helped suppress some of the inflationary tendencies in the nation's strong economy. A weak dollar tends to produce inflationary price increases in imports. By moderating those price increases, the stronger dollar has reduced inflation expectations and given the Fed more flexibility to deal with a strong economy.    &quot;Bond yields would have been higher without the strength in the dollar,&quot; says Steven Einhorn, a portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs. &quot;That clearly acts to the benefit of equities since in this environment stocks can only do what bonds allow them to do.&quot;    But there's a limit to how much good a rising dollar can do for the stock market, and Mr. Einhorn and other market professionals believe that the limit has been reached. Although equity investors shrugged off the surprisingly large June trade deficit reported a few weeks ago as an anomaly in an otherwise improving trade situation, any further increase in the dollar's strength could do lasting damage to the nation's trade picture. What's more, other nations, seeking to defend their own currencies, are raising their interest rates. That could wind up hurting their economies and financial markets.    &quot;Continued strength in the dollar is the flip side of weakness in the yen and mark,&quot; says Mr. Einhorn. &quot;Insofar as Germany and especially Japan tighten money and weaken their own share prices, that transmits itself into the U.S. markets.&quot;    But if a stronger dollar worries analysts like Mr. Einhorn, the prospect of another tumble in the dollar's value is perhaps more frightening. Should the U.S. currency start falling again, it would rekindle inflationary fears, adding additional incentive for the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher. That's hardly an environment in which stocks would thrive.    &quot;If you compare a stronger dollar to the alternative -- a falling dollar -- the stronger dollar is much to be preferred,&quot; says Mickey D. Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity Bancorp. in Philadelphia.    Yet a plunging dollar seems to some analysts increasingly likely. Charles Eaton, a portfolio strategist at Nikko Securities in New York, worries that the U.S. government, in its efforts to restrain the dollar's climb, may push the currency too hard. He suggests that another round of dollar softness would severely test foreign confidence in U.S. financial markets.    &quot;We've raised the potential for a currency crisis down the road,&quot; he says, adding that &quot;if you had been through the experience the Japanese went through when the dollar was falling, you'd be terrified&quot; of another sharp decline in the dollar.    The hope, then, is that the dollar will stabilize in its current range. But there isn't a great deal of confidence that will happen.    &quot;Certainly the central banks are trying to engineer stability, and our own sense is that they will be successful for a little while longer,&quot; says Mr. Einhorn. &quot;But as we enter 1989 the dollar will weaken again, principally because the trade deficit improvements will be slower than the market demands. That will be to the detriment of equities.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   A mild rebound in the bond market helped stock prices nose higher in the slowest trading session of the year.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.58 points to close at 2017.43, up only 1.42 for the week. A mere 89.2 million shares changed hands, the smallest turnover since the day after last Thanksgiving.    Stocks opened lower but moved higher after bond prices rebounded, following reports that consumer income and spending for July increased moderately. However, analysts doubted the stock market's gains were important or sustainable given the lack of investor participation.    Primerica jumped 2 3/8 to 30 1/8 on rumors that Commercial Credit Group is interested in acquiring the company, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Tenneco rose 1 1/8 to 47 3/8 after Kidder Peabody repeated its strong buy recommendation on the stock. The brokerage firm noted the stock's high dividend yield and the prospects for the sale of the company's oil and gas properties.    Scotty's surged 1 5/8 to 14 3/8. Belgium-based GB-Inno-BM S.A. said it will boost its stake to 42.7% of the company by buying shares from Scotty's chairman and chief executive, James Sweet, and some of his associates. Separately, Mr. Sweet announced his resignation. GB-Inno-BM said it isn't currently planning a tender offer for the balance of the shares, but wouldn't rule it out for the future.    Macmillan continued to inch up, adding another 5/8 to 83 7/8. The company rejected Maxwell Communication's $80-a-share bid, saying it has had discussions with other parties that lead it to believe the company is worth more. </TEXT></DOC>
