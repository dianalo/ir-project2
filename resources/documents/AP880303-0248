The federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions,threatened a three-day protest if the April 11-13 meeting isprohibited. It puts its membership at 750,000.   Other organizations also announced plans to defy thegovernment's emergency regulations. Eighteen opposition groups werebarred last week from conducting any activity not approved by thegovernment.   The South African Youth Congress said it was changing its namein an attempt to get around the restrictions.   Nkosi Molala, president of the newly banned Azanian PeoplesOrganization, said he and two colleagues were detained by policefor most of the day and questioned about a new group, the AzanianCoordinating Committee. He said police warned him the new groupwould be banned, too, if it was a renamed version of the restrictedorganization.   The South African Council of Churches is one of several groupswhich promised to take over projects of the 18 bannedorganizations. It said it defied a government order to submitcopies of its monthly journal, Ecunews, for review under emergencycensorship laws.   The church council said it was notified by Minister of HomeAffairs Stoffel Botha it had committed a criminal offense and hethreatened legal action.   The council is a coalition of most Protestant churches in SouthAfrica, except for the white Dutch Reformed Church.   The council said it told Botha it would not comply with anyorder under the state of emergency proclamation because the20-month-old decree violated ``the Christian understanding ofjustice,'' by eliminating the right of the accused to defendthemselves in open court.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions has called forinternational disinvestment from South African business,redistribution of wealth to the workers and a complete boycott ofSouth Africa to pressure the government to change laws that deny anational vote to the black majority of 26 million.   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separatedistricts, schools and health services.   Also on Thursday:   _Dr. Ivan Toms, a 35-year-old white doctor who has run a clinicin the Cape Town black township of Crossroads since 1980, wassentenced to 630 days in prison for refusing to serve, even as anon-combatant, in the South African Defense Force. Toms said heobjected to stationing white conscripts in black townships, in theSouth African-occupied territory of Namibia and in neighboringAngola.   _A judge ruled that police who hid behind crates in a truck toentrap stone-throwing youths were to blame for three deaths whenthey fired on a crowd in the 1985 ``Trojan Horse'' incident inAthlone, a mixed-race township outside Cape Town. In an inquest,Magistrate Gert Hoffmann ruled the police action was unreasonableand referred the case to the attorney general for investigation ofcriminal charges.</TEXT></DOC>
