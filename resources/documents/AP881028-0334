In a letter to Charles Hugel, chairman of RJR Nabisco's specialcommittee of outside directors, Kohlberg Kravis said it had beenadvised that RJR Nabisco managers and their partners were ``activelyattempting to sell significant portions of the company and ... mayhave provided potential buyers with financial and other informationabout the businesses they seek to sell.''   The powerful buyout firm declined to identify which businesses itbelieved RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson and his financialpartners, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Inc., were tryingto sell.   However, when Johnson announced last week that management wasconsidering a $17 billion plan to take Nabisco private, he indicatedhe would sell off much of the company's Nabisco food operations.   RJR Nabisco's managers ended talks with Kohlberg Kravis onWednesday about making a joint offer to buy the company fromstockholders.   A spokeswoman at RJR Nabisco's headquarters in Atlanta said thecompany had no comment on Kohlberg Kravis's letter. A spokesman forShearson said the investment house had no immediate comment.   RJR Nabisco stock rose $3 a share to $85 in composite New YorkStock Exchange trading.   Kohlberg Kravis said it believed food business competitors ofNabisco were among the potential buyers already lining up for saletalks.   Selling assets to competitors ``could be detrimental to thecompany's business from a competitive point of view and have adeleterious effect on the employees of those businesses,'' theletter said.   Kohlberg Kravis essentially is alleging that RJR Nabisco may bein the process of employing a ``scorched-earth policy,'' which isthe name Wall Street has given the tactic of a takeover targetselling off assets in an attempt to make itself less attractive.   ``It makes the company less than whole ... it can make itimpossible to do the deal,'' said Edward Froelich, an analyst atPershing andamp; Co.   If Kohlberg Kravis is serious about the charge, analysts said, itlikely will file suit seeking to prevent RJR Nabisco from proceedingwith the sale of any assets.   ``If they dismember the animal, obviously you have to change yourbid,'' Froelich said, referring to the $90-a-share tender offerKohlberg Kravis launched on Thursday.   Kohlberg Kravis said in the letter that it did ``not contemplatedismemberment of the company's operations.'' The firm said it wouldretain all of RJR Nabisco's tobacco businesses and ``a significantportion'' of the food operations if its takeover bid succeeded.   RJR Nabisco has a plethora of high-profile brand name products _including Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers _ that analysts say areextremely attractive properties.   ``They've got tons of stuff that already has shelf space and(market) domination,'' Froelich said.   On the tobacco side, the company's R.J. Reynolds unit makesWinston and Camel cigarettes, among others.   Separately, Kohlberg Kravis offered in its letter to allow ``asignificant number'' of RJR Nabisco managers an equity investment inthe takeover. The firm also noted that it intended to retain``substantially all of the company's employees in the operationswhich are not divested.''   Principals Henry Kravis and George Roberts indicated that theymet on Thursday with Hugel, president of Stamford, Conn.-basedCombustion Engineering Inc. The letter outlined the points Kravisand Roberts made in that meeting.   According to their impression of the meeting, Hugel indicated a``willingness to establish a process providing us with anopportunity to meet with management'' and have access to certainnon-public information.</TEXT></DOC>
