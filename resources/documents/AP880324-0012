Sudan has asked the United States to remove its emergencymilitary stockpiles and facilities, and Somalia has rejected thevisit of a top-level military delegation, the officials say.   U.S. military aid levels to Africa this year have dropped to anunprecedented low of $25.2 million, said Deputy Assistant Secretaryof Defense James L. Woods.   ``We have since last year lost our prepositioning rights in oneimportant African country, and have had important military''negotiations canceled in another, Woods told the House subcommitteeon foreign operations Wednesday.   Although he declined to name either country, another officialwho spoke only on condition he not be named identified the firstcountry as Sudan. He said the non-aligned government of Sadiq Mahdiwas unwilling to honor political arrangements made by hispredecessor Gaafar Nimeiri, who was deposed in April 1985.   U.S. relations with Sudan, strategically placed in easternAfrica on the Red Sea coast, have been strained by Sudan's warmingties with Libya.   As a result of congressional budget cuts, as well as the lesscordial ties with the Khartoum government, U.S. military aid toSudan was canceled in fiscal 1988, along with six other Africancountries. The administration will seek a renewal of the aid forfiscal 1989, said the official.   Somalia, upset with a drop of its military aid to $5 millionfrom some $20 million in 1986, rejected a visit by a high-levelU.S. military delegation, the official said. But the visit willprobably be rescheduled, he added.   Woods warned that if the military aid for Africa remains at thecurrent level, ``we can no longer operate a meaningful aid programto Africa.''   The administration has asked for $740 million in economic anddevelopment aid for Africa next year and $83.7 million in militaryassistance.   Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker told the panel that``the perception in Africa is that we're opting out. And thatcreates strains.'' U.S. military aid to Africa accounts for only 3percent of the total military assistance to the continent, Crockersaid.   In contrast, the Soviet Union has poured $15 billion intoAfrican states since 1980, more than 17 times the U.S. input, hesaid.   In addition, the Soviets maintain 6,500 military advisers inAfrica, and Cuba has some 45,000 troops there, most of them inAngola.   ``Properly funded, the (U.S. military aid) program reducesreliance on Soviet bloc hardware and advisers,'' Woods said.</TEXT></DOC>
