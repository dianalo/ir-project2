The suspension of the Soviet troop withdrawal, announced Nov. 4,could ``weaken or even reverse the general trend toward detente,''it said.   The editorial did not mention any specific examples, but it mayhave been referring in part to improvements in Chinese-Sovietrelations in recent months. The two countries split bitterly in the1960s over ideological and strategic differences, and China hasrefused to normalize relations until the Soviets remove their troopsfrom Afghanistan.   The Soviet Union sent troops there in 1979 to help replace oneMarxist leader with another, and has kept them since to battleanti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas.   The Soviet Union partially met another Chinese demand, to reduceits troop presence on the Chinese border. The third demand is topressure its ally, Vietnam, to withdraw from Cambodia.   Chinese leaders' comments on the prospects for better relationswith Moscow have been more positive since the Soviets began theirtroop pullout from Afghanistan on May 15. Foreign Minister QianQichen goes to Moscow next month in the first working visit there bya Chinese foreign minister since 1956.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said recently that a Chinese-Sovietsummit could be held as early as next year.   In suspending its pullout from Afghanistan, the Soviet Unionblamed increased attacks by the Afghan guerrillas.   But the Beijing Review said the move ``raised doubts aboutwhether the Soviets are going to live up to the Geneva agreement.''   ``The Soviet Union ... should implement the agreement in earnestand withdraw all its military forces from Afghanistan asscheduled,'' it said. ``It should not look for any pretexts todelay.''</TEXT></DOC>
