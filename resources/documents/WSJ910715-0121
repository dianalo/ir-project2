Retail sales dropped 0.2% last month to $151.92 billionafter rising 0.8% the month before, the Commerce Departmentsaid. Although auto purchases increased more than in anymonth since March, other sales were disappointing.</LP><TEXT>   Producer prices declined 0.3% during the month, accordingto the Labor Department, following a 0.6% rise in May thateconomists had described as a fluke. Energy prices, hewing toa continuing trend, led the decline with a 1.4% drop. For thefirst time in four months, food prices dropped, falling 0.6%.Excluding these often-volatile figures, producer pricesremained unchanged after posting a 0.4% rise in May.   The reports suggest that the climb out of the recessionmay be a difficult one, some economists said. &quot;It looks likethe consumer is running out of steam,&quot; said CharlesLieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers HanoverSecurities Corp. in New York. &quot;The data is catching up toreality. There's no recovery under way. There's a bouncecoming from after the war. It's not sustainable.&quot;   And Gordon Richards, an economist for the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, said, &quot;The decline in retailsales is further evidence that the recovery will be slow anderratic.&quot;   With inflation on the low side, the Federal Reserve andthe financial markets are expected to breathe easier. RobertBlack, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond,Va., was encouraged by the producer-price report and said heexpects the favorable inflation trend to continue. &quot;It's oneof the few times when I've been optimistic on the inflationside,&quot; he said.   On the retail front, auto sales rose 1.1% while sales ofall other goods fell by 0.5%. But Mr. Lieberman said the risein auto sales was also illusory because of excessivediscounts. &quot;You can attract sales if you're willing to payfor them,&quot; he said. The retail sales figures aren't adjustedfor inflation and are often revised substantially. Overallretail sales in the past three months were 1% higher than inthe previous three months, the Commerce Department said.   The downturn in prices at the producer level waswidespread. Over the past year, producer prices have risen amoderate 3.5%. The Labor Department said prices ofintermediate, or partially processed, goods rose by 0.1% inJune, the first rise in this index since November. Prices ofcrude goods, or raw materials, fell 1.9%.   The producer price index doesn't reflect the price ofservices, such as health care. Such prices are measured inthe consumer price index, which is to be released Wednesday.   All the figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.                                                                                                          Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes(1982=100) for June, before seasonal adjustment, and thepercentage changes from June 1990.
