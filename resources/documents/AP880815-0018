Roberto Rodriguez of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugeessaid by telephone that the refugees and more than 150 vehicles wereallowed to enter El Salvador at 5:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. EDT) after the15 church workers agreed to stay in Honduras.   Salvadoran government officials say many refugees sympathizewith leftist guerrillas, and have accused church workers of similarleanings.   Rodriguez said the refugees were on their way to hometowns innorthern Chalatenango province.   There was no immediate comment from the Salvadoran government.Members of the U.S. church organization that had aided the refugeescould not be reached for comment.   Late Saturday, the convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks carryingthe refugees and their belongings were halted in Honduras about 500yards from the border.   They had left the Mesa Grande refugee camp 30 miles to the northunder an accord worked out among the refugees, the Salvadorangovernment and the U.N. organization, which is overseeing therepatriation.   Some of the Salvadorans spent up to eight years in the MesaGrande camp.   Jose Maria Mendiluce, the U.N. agency's Central Americandirector, said the presence of the U.S. church workers _ members ofthe Going Home organization _ was not contemplated in the accord.   Earlier Sunday, Interior Minister Edgar Belloso Funes toldreporters at the border that his government ``welcomes with openarms'' the Salvadoran refugees.   ``But the so-called internationalists among them are using ourbrothers for strictly political ends. They (the foreigners) arecoming here to break our laws, and I have orders from the highestlevel that they not be permitted entry,'' he said.   Amadeo Lopez, a returning refugee, had said the group wasinsisting the U.S. church workers be allowed to enter. He said therefugees were determined to wait in their mile-long convoy untiltheir demand was met.   But the 1,230 refugees, including hundreds of infants andchildren, had little food and appeared unprepared to spend dayswaiting on the road. Two pregnant women among the refugees wereexpected to give birth in coming days.   Louis Vitale, a Roman Catholic priest from Oakland, Calif., andspokesman for the Going Home delegation, blamed the Salvadorangovernment for the dispute.   ``This is part of the Salvadoran government's continuing effortsto obstruct the refugees' return,'' he said, adding that allmembers of his delegation had visas for El Salvador.   Going Home is an interfaith organization supporting Salvadoranrefugees. It participated last October in the first bigrepatriation of Salvadoran refugees from Honduras.   The return of refugees is a highly charged issue in this smallCentral American country torn by nearly nine years of civil war.   The armed forces consider the three Salvadoran refugee camps inHonduras part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas fighting theU.S.-supported government. About 4,300 refugees returned last yearand about 15,000 Salvadoran refugees remain in the camps.   The Salvadoran government is concerned about their politicalsympathies and the burden they may place on an economy devastatedby war, and so it is reluctant to collaborate with that project.   But a regional peace accord signed last August underscored theright of refugees to return home, and the government eventuallycooperated with the return.   ``The terrorists use Mesa Grande as a refuge, to recover fromwounds and to rest. The people there generally sympathize with thesubversives. Their return could be detrimental to us militarily,''army Col. Ciro Lopez Roque told The Associated Press at the borderSaturday. He is commander of the 4th Brigade in charge of thenorthern frontier province of Chalatenango.   But he also said that ``as a Salvadoran, I recognize that everySalvadoran has a right to be in his country, and should be here.''   The refugees intend to return to three towns in Chalatenangofrom which they fled in the early 1980s.   Sofia Enriquez, who left her town of Los Ranchos in 1982, stoodbeside a bus and held her infant daughter while another daughterclutched her skirt. Both girls were born in Mesa Grande.   Asked why she left, she said: ``We were persecuted. They werekilling people just for the fun of it.''   Most of the 65,000 people killed in the war have been civilians.   Human rights groups blame security forces and rightist deathsquads for most of the tens of thousands of political murders inthe early 1980s. Such killings dropped off dramatically after 1983.   Ms. Enriquez, 25, said she hoped for a better life in her owncountry. But asked how she planned to manage as a single motherwith two children, no home and no job, she said: ``Who knows.''</TEXT></DOC>
