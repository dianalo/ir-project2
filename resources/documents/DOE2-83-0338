However, more efficient greenhouses have introduced anotherenvironmental problem, namely the high internal humidity, which is detrimentalto the greenhouse crop. The use of a heat pump presents an opportunityto control the environment and at the same time to provide the necessaryheat supply to maintain the greenhouse temperature, thereby enablingan energy efficient control strategy to be achieved. The thesis developsa simulation of a double-clad greenhouse structure and synthesizes aknowledge-based control system that seeks to maintain a specified temperature- humidity profile, with minimum energy consumption, according to theneeds of the growth characteristics of a given plant, which in the caseof the experimental data is tomatoes. Using energy-balance techniques,a dynamic model based on a double cladded greenhouse structure coveredwith polyster material was validated with experimental data.</TEXT></DOC>
