The Commission also seeks public comment generallyon the merits of its procedures for consideration of post-complaint partialsettlements, including both settlements that would resolve only some ofthe charges against a particular respondent, and settlements that wouldresolve charges against only some of the respondents in a proceeding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>These amendments are effective May 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send comments to the Secretary, Federal Trade Commission,6th and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20580.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Marc Winerman, Attorney, Officeof the General Counsel, 202-326-2451.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Pursuant to Rule 3.25 of the Commission'sRules of Practice, 16 CFR 3.25, the Commission has occasionally withdrawnfrom adjudication portions of a matter that would be affected by a proposedconsent settlement to resolve some, but not all, of the charges in a complaintwith respect to particular respondents. <T3>See Midcon Corp</T3>., D. 9198, Order Withdrawing Matter From Adjudicationas to Allegation In Count II of Complaint, September 19, 1985; <T3>Detroit Auto Dealers Ass'n</T3>, D. 9189, Order Withdrawing Count Twofrom Adjudication As To Certain Respondents, June 25, 1985. In addition,a 1986 amendment to Commission rule 4.7(f), 16 CFR 4.7(f), provides thatoff-the-record communications between the Commission and complaint counselrespecting such proposed settlements do not violate the agency's generalrestrictions on <T3>ex parte</T3> contacts in adjudicative proceedings. <T3>See</T3> 51 FR 36901 (1986).Rule 3.25 (as well as Rule 4.7(f)) already makes clear that the Commissionwill consider, under its post-complaint settlement procedures, settlementsthat are signed by some but not all of the respondents in a proceeding.Rule 3.25 does not, however, explicitly address settlement proposals thatwould resolve only some of the charges against the respondents who signedthem. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that such settlementproposals are covered by the Rule.Because the amendment merely clarifies existing practice, it has been deemeda final rule. The Commission nonetheless invites public comment concerningits procedures for considering partial settlements. Specifically, the Commissioninvites public comment on its practice of withdrawing a matter from adjudicationwhen a partial settlement is proposed, irrespective of whether the settlementis ``partial'' because it is not signed by all the respondents to the proceedingor because it does not resolve all the charges against the party or partieswho signed it.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Availability of Partial Settlements</ITAG>The Commission believes that a partial settlement procedure can resolveportions of a case expeditiously and limit litigation, with its attendantcosts, to issues that are really in dispute.The Administrative Procedure Act, though not expressly requiring partialsettlements, requires agencies to consider settlement proposals ``whentime, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest permit * **.'' 5 U.S.C. 554(c). Partial settlements are consistent with this mandate.Further, although a partial settlement may expose the Commission to issuesthat remain in adjudication, such exposure does not preclude the agencyfrom ruling on the subsequent matter. <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, <T3>Pangburn</T3> v. <T3>CAB</T3>, 311 F.2d 349, 358 (1st Cir. 1962); <T3>American Home Products</T3>, 95 F.T.C. 381 (1980) (finding ``withoutmerit'' the argument that consideration of settlement proposal would disqualifyCommission from deciding appeal in a factually-related proceeding). Courtsas well as the Commission may consider related cases sequentially. <T3>Cf. Transeastern Shipping Corp. </T3>v.<T3> India Supply Mission</T3>, 53 F.R.D. 204 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (decliningto consolidate cases involving same defendant and interpretation of substantiallyidentical contracts, notwithstanding that cases would be decided sequentially,where cases were at different stages of pre-trial proceedings.) In thecase of partial settlement proposals, which benefit the Commission, thesettling respondents, and the public for the reasons set forth above, webelieve such consideration is both lawful and appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Ex parte and Pendency Issues Raised by Withdrawing a Portion ofa Matter from Adjudication, and Leaving the Remainder in Adjudication,When a Partial Settlement is Proposed</ITAG>A. <T3>Ex parte issues</T3>. When a post-complaint settlement proposal isoffered unilaterally by respondents, Rule 3.25(d) provides for withdrawalof the matter from adjudication only upon the issuance of an order by theCommission to do so. When a proposal is joined by complaint counsel, however,Rule 3.25(c) provides for automatic withdrawal of the matter from adjudicationas to the respondents who signed the agreement. This provision has alsobeen construed to authorize removal of particular counts of a matter fromadjudication when a proposed settlement would resolve those counts, butnot other pending counts, against a respondent.Removal from adjudication, of course, terminates <T3>ex parte</T3> constraints with respect to communications about theportion of a matter that was thus withdrawn. Further, under CommissionRule 4.7(f), <T3>ex parte</T3> communications between staff and decisionmaking employeesabout the proposed consent are permitted even if they deal with mattersthat remain in adjudication, subject to a provision that such communicationswill be placed on the public record when the Commission determines thatdisclosure will serve the interest of justice.The Commission believes that such communications are appropriate as a matterof law, for reasons set forth in the Federal Register notice announcinga 1986 amendment to the <T3>ex parte</T3> rule. <T3>See </T3>51 FR 36802 (1986).As a matter of policy, such communications enable staff to provide a candidassessment of both its litigation prospects and its reaction to publiccomments received, and a full explanation of its decision to recommendsettlement. This information enhances the decisionmaking process and reducesthe risk that the Commission will reject a consent, or accept one, basedon inadequate or misleading information. Barring or publicly disclosingstaff communications would only impede the flow of advice to the Commission.<T3>See NLRB</T3> v. <T3>Sears Roebuck andamp; Co. </T3>421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975) (disclosure ofadvice may inhibit communications). The Commission believes these advantagesare present irrespective of whether a proposed consent would resolve allof a matter or only part of it.The Commission has considered the possible appearance of unfairness inthese communications. This problem would appear to be most acute when aproposal has been joined by only some of the respondents in a proceeding,and there is no consent to the <T3>ex parte </T3>communications by those who failed to join. However,the Commission does not believe that proposed partial settlements differsubstantially from other situations in which <T3>ex parte</T3> communications are permitted. Under Rule 3.25, for example,the agency can reject a proposed settlement of an entire matter, and returnthe matter to adjudication, notwithstanding <T3>ex parte,</T3> post-complaint discussions that occurred while the matterhad been withdrawn from adjudication. Similarly, under Rule 4.7(f), theCommission may conduct <T3>ex parte </T3>discussions with staff, notwithstanding the possiblerelevancy of such discussions to ongoing litigation, if the discussionsconcern ``the initiation, conduct, or disposition of a separate investigationor proceeding.'' 16 CFR 4.7(f).In view of these other situations, the Commission does not believe thatpartial settlement proceedings raise unique <T3>ex parte</T3> concerns, even from the perspective of the ``appearanceof unfairness.'' To the contrary, the nature of the Commission's functionswill necessarily dictate, on occasion, that the agency review a matterin a prosecutorial (or administrative) capacity while a related matteris being considered in a quasi-judicial capacity. When this occurs, theCommission believes the advantages of an <T3>ex parte</T3> procedure are likely to outweight its disadvantages.Another possible disadvantage is that, if proposed settlement of some countsin a complaint permits <T3>ex parte</T3> communications, respondents may be deterred from enteringpartial settlements. The Commission has no reason to believe that thisis a substantial problem, particularly because respondents, notwithstandingpossible concerns about <T3>ex parte</T3> communications, share the Commission's interest in resolvinglitigation expeditiously and inexpensively through settlements.B. <T3>Continuing Litigation of the Portion of the Matter Not Subject to theProposed Settlement.</T3> To the extent that litigation of the remainingissues in a proceeding continues during consideration of a proposed partialsettlement, an inefficiency may arise if the Commission ultimately rejectsthe consent. It may then be necessary to recall witnesses who had testifiedwhile the settlement was under consideration. However, the ALJ could presumablydelay the reception of particular evidence in a case where the possibilityof this problem appears serious. In any event, the Commission does notbelieve this problem is sufficiently common or grave to reject the useof partial settlements entirely.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Issues Raised by Automatic Withdrawal Under Rule 3.25(c)</ITAG>The Commission has specifically determined, pending possible reconsiderationfollowing public comment, that Rule 3.25(c) will continue to provide forautomatic removal of a matter from adjudication when complaint counseljoin in a consent proposal, although a Commission order will continue tobe required under Rule 3.25(d) before a matter is withdrawn from adjudicationon the basis of a proposed consent in which complaint counsel do not join.The Commission has further determined, again pending possible reconsideration,that Rule 3.25 will continue to provide that this procedure is availablefor partial settlement proposals that are signed by only some of the partiesto a proceeding and, as noted above, the Commission is amending the ruleto clarify the availability of these procedures for partial settlementsthat would resolve only some charges against the parties who sign it.Automatic removal, when complaint counsel join a settlement proposal, enablescomplaint counsel to explain candidly their recommendation that the Commissionaccept a proposed settlement that is before the agency under Rule 3.25(c).If the Commission has concerns with an automatic removal that has takenplace, it may limit non-record communications before the fact, place themon the public record after the fact, <T3>see </T3>Rule 4.7(f), return the matter to adjudication, or some combinationof the above.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 3</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Investigations.Accordingly, the Federal Trade Commission amends Title 16, Chapter I, SubchapterA, Part 3, of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 3_INVESTIGATIONS</ITAG>1. The authority for Part 3 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 6, 38 Stat. 721 (15 U.S.C. 46), unless otherwisenoted.</ITAG>2. Paragraphs (a) through (f) of andSection; 3.25 are revised to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 3.25 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Consent agreement settlements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(a) The Administrative Law Judge may, in his discretion and without suspensionof prehearing procedures, hold conferences for the purpose of supervisingnegotiations for the settlement of the case, in whole or in part, by wayof consent agreement.(b) A proposal to settle a matter in adjudication by consent agreementshall be submitted by way of a motion to withdraw the matter from adjudicationfor the purpose of considering the proposed consent agreement. Any suchmotion shall be accompanied by a proposed consent agreement containinga proposed order executed by one or more respondents and conforming tothe requirements of andSection; 2.32; the proposed consent agreement itself,however, shall not be placed on the public record unless and until it isaccepted by the Commission as provided herein. If the proposed consentagreement affects only some of the respondents or resolves only some ofthe charges in adjudication, the motion required by this subsection shallso state and shall specify the portions of the matter that the proposalwould resolve.(c) If the proposed consent agreement accompanying the motion has alsobeen executed by complaint counsel, including the appropriate Bureau Director,the Secretary shall issue an order withdrawing from adjudication thoseportions of the matter that the proposal would resolve and all proceedingsbefore the Administrative Law Judge shall be stayed with respect to suchportions, pending a determination by the Commission pursuant to paragraph(f) of this section.(d) If the proposed consent agreement accompanying the motion has not beenexecuted by complaint counsel, the Administrative Law Judge may certifythe motion and agreement to the Commission together with his recommendationif he determines, in writing, that there is a likelihood of settlement.The filing of a motion under this subsection and certification thereofto the Commission shall not stay proceedings before the AdministrativeLaw Judge unless the Administrative Law Judge or the Commission shall soorder. Upon certification of a motion pursuant to this subsection, theCommission may, if it is satisfied that there is a likelihood of settlement,issue an order withdrawing from adjudication those portions of the matterthat the proposal would resolve, for the purpose of considering the proposedconsent agreement.(e) The Commission will treat those portions of a matter withdrawn fromadjudication pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section as beingin a nonadjudicative status. Portions not so withdrawn shall remain inan adjudicative status.(f) After the matter has been withdrawn from adjudication, in whole orin part, the Commission may: (1) Accept the proposed consent agreement,(2) reject it and return to adjudication for further proceedings any portionof the matter previously withdrawn from adjudication, or (3) take suchother action as it may deem appropriate. If a proposed consent agreementis accepted, the Commission will place it on the public record, togetherwith any initial report of compliance submitted pursuant to andSection; 2.33,and at the same time, will make available an explanation of the provisionsof the order and the relief to be obtained thereby, and any other informationwhich it deems helpful in assisting interested persons to understand theterms of the order. The Commission will publish the agreement, order, andexplanation in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. For a period of sixty (60) days after placementof the order on the public record and issuance of the statement, the Commissionwill receive and consider any comments concerning the order that may befiled by any interested person. Thereafter, the Commission may either withdrawits acceptance of the agreement and so notify the parties, in which eventit will return the affected portions of the matter to adjudication forfurther proceedings or take such other action as it may consider appropriate,or issue and serve its decision.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By direction of the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
