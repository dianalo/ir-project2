Summary of Facts and Representations  1. The Bank is a national banking association regulated by the Comprollerof the Currency. The Bank was appointed as a manager with respect to theThrift Savings Plan established pursuant to the provisions of FERSA (thePlan) on December 21, 1987. The Bank also provides investment advisoryand trustee services to many qualified pension and profit sharing plansqualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code),governmental pension plans as defined under section 414(d) of the Codeand other institutional accounts and individuals.  2. Section 8438(b) of FERSA requires that the Federal Retirement ThriftInvestment Board (the Board) establish a Common Stock Index InvestmentFund (the ``C'' Fund) to be invested in a portfolio designed to replicatethe performance of an index which is a commonly recognized index comprisedof common stocks, the aggregate market value of which is a reasonably completerepresentation of the United States equity markets. The agreement betweenthe Bank and the Board provides that the ``C'' Fund shall be invested withthe objective of replicating the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 Composite StockPrice Index (the Sandamp;P 500). Pursuant to this agreement, the Bank currentlyintends to invest the assets of the ``C'' Fund in its Equity Index Fundwhich also has the investment objective of replicating the return of theSandamp;P 500. While this agreement would permit the Board to have the assetsof the Plan invested in an individual, ``stand-alone'' portfolio that satisifesthe statutory objective, the Bank currently intends to invest the assetsof the ``C'' Fund in its Equity Index Fund. The Bank will not charge thePlan any additional fees for investing in the Equity Index Fund. The Bank'scompensation is derived solely from management fees which it receives fromthe Plan and which are no more than the fees that would be charged forindividual management of a ``stand-alone portfolio''.  3. The Equity Index Fund is passively managed in that the choice of stockspurchased and sold, and the volume purchased and sold are made accordingto an independent third party index, the Sandamp;P 500, rather than accordingto active evaluation of investments. Also, the Bank has no direct or indirectbeneficial interest in the assets of the Equity Index Fund, and the Bankas trustee of the Equity Index Fund is prohibited from acquiring such aninterest by regulations promulgated by the Comptroller of the Currency. 4. Cash contributions which are directed by Plan participants to be investedin the ``C'' Fund are invested by the Plan in the Equity Index Fund. Inexchange for such cash contributions, the Plan receives investment units(Units) evidencing the investment. When a participant is to receive a distributionor wishes to reallocate all or a portion of his or her investent in the``C'' Fund to a different investment fund, the Bank may be instructed toliquidate Units and transfer the resulting cash from the Equity Index Fundto the Plan. Transaction costs for investments or withdrawals are allocatedamong the participants in the Equity Index Fund (which includes the Planand other employee benefit plans).  5. Investments or wtihdrawals normally occur on ``opening'' dates. On theseopenings, which occur at least 4 times a month, the Bank nets the investments(including cash dividends received on stocks held by the Equity Index Fund)and withdrawals from the Equity Index Fund against each other and makessales and purchases of stocks as the aggregate amount invested in the EquityIndex Fund rises or falls. In addition, the Sandamp;P 500 will occasionallyadd or delete a stock or change the relative capitalization weighting ofa stock. The criteria for such changes are established and maintained bythe Standard andamp; Poor's Corporation. If a stock is deleted from the Sandamp;P500, the Equity Index Fund must sell the stock. These changes in the Sandamp;P500 are infrequent, although radical shifts in the availability of equitystocks occasioned by corporate ``takeover'' activity have increased thefrequency of changes in the Sandamp;P 500. With respect to the timing ofthe above transactions, the Bank states that it attempts to replicate anychanges to the Equity Index Fund as quickly as possible, generally withinthree days of the event.  6. the applicant represents that if the Equity Index Fund is required toengage in a stock transaction because of one of the events described aboveand must do so in the open market, the Equity Index Fund would incur substantialtransaction costs including brokerage commissions, the ``marketmakers spread''(the amount charged by the exchange specialists for accepting market riskin the stock price during the transactions) and the possible negative marketimpact of large block trades. These costs, it is represented, can be substantiallyreduced if cross-trading is done among the Equity Index Fund and investmentfunds sponsored by the Bank and or managed by the Bank or its affiliates. 7. The applicant represents that the average brokerage commission paidby the Bank for regular market transactions is 3-4 cents per share. Thecommission paid for the cross-trades is only 1 cent per share or less,which reflects the record keeping costs charged by brokers. In this regard,the applicant represents that the brokers are able to provide record keepingservices more economically than the Bank. Cross-trades will avoid the marketmakersspread and the negative market impact caused by large block transactions.     8. The Bank was previously granted an exemption by the Department undersection 408(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 andsection 4975(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code allowing cross-tradingbetween certain plans for which the Bank provides advisory and trust services.See Prohibited Transaction Exemption 87-51, 52 FR 22557, June 17, 1987(PTE 87-51). The applicant is now requesting that a similar exemption begranted under FERSA. The applicant represents that a large proportion ofEquity Index Fund stock transactions are eligible for such cross-tradesand that these cross-trades can generate substantial transaction cost savingsfor the Equity Index Fund and therefore for its participants, includingthe Plan. The applicant represents that all the brokers used in cross-tradeswill be unrelated to and independent of the Bank. The applicant furtherrepresents that from July 1, 1987 through December 31, 1987, the EquityIndex Fund utilizing PTE 87-51 saved approximately $700,000 in brokeragecommissions. The Bank uses the closing price on the date of the trade forshares listed on a national exchange or NASDAQ to set the share price forall cross-trades except in situations where a particular stock is addedor deleted from the Sandamp;P 500, in which case the Bank will use the openingprice on the next trading day. The Bank represents that it is necessaryto use the opening price on the next trading day, because additions ordeletions to the Sandamp;P 500 are not typically announced until after themarket has closed for the day. By using the opening price on the next dayof trading, the Bank states that the transaction price will be more representativeof the probable price of a market trade and as a result investment performance-trackingerrors may be avoided.9. Additionally, the applicant represents that on April 29, 1987, Standardand Poor's added Wells Fargo Stock (the Stock) to the Sandamp;P 500. Becauseof concerns over the propriety of acquiring the Stock, the Equity IndexFund has not acquired any of the Stock to date. Although the Stock constitutesonly a small fraction of the Sandamp;P 500, the Applicant represents thatfailure to acquire the Stock has led to tracking errors. Further, as statedpreviously, the Equity Index Fund is passively managed and stocks purchasedand sold, including the Stock are made pursuant to an independent thirdparty index. Accordingly, the Bank proposes to acquire and hold the Stockin the Equity Index Fund as required by the Sandamp;P 500.10. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactionssatisfy the statutory criteria of section 8477(c)(3) of FERSA because:(a) the Equity Index Fund will buy or sell stocks only when changes aremade to the portfolio of stocks held in the Sandamp;P 500 and when a participantin the Plan invests in or withdraws from the ``C'' Fund, (b) the EquityIndex Fund will save significant amounts of money on brokerage commissions,(c) the Bank will receive no additional fees as a result of the proposedcross-trades, and (d) the acquisition and holding of Wells Fargo stockwill allow the Board to carry out its statutorily mandated investment directiveof replicating an index which is a reasonably complete representation ofthe United States equity markets.<T3>For Further Information Contact:</T3> Alan Levitas of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8194.
