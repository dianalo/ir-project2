Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, said Monday it hadfiled its objection with the Department of Transportation inWashington. Pan Am asked the department to conduct a hearing on theproposed $471 million sale.   The transaction must be approved by the department and federalbankruptcy court in New York, where Eastern filed for Chapter 11protection from creditors last March after pilots, flightattendants and Machinists struck the Miami-based airline.   ``In order to preserve the competitive balance in Miami, certainspecific routes that are a part of the proposed transfer (toAmerican) should instead be awarded to Pan Am,'' New York-based PanAm said in a statement. Pan Am asserted that it, rather thanAmerican, should be awarded service from Miami to Guayaquil andQuito, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; and Bogota, Colombia.   Pan Am also said it should be given the Miami-Toronto route,also included in Eastern's agreement with American.   Pan Am said it objects to ``the wholesale acquisition of acomprehensive network of valuable restricted routes, givingAmerican in one fell swoop an entrenched position at Miami.''   American, the nation's largest carrier, agreed in late Decemberafter months of haggling to buy the Latin American routes fromEastern. The sale would reduce Eastern to about two-thirds itspre-strike size.   The transfer would ``convert Miami from a three-carrier,competitive hub...to a two-carrier hub that eventually may bedominated by American Airlines,'' Pan Am said.   Eastern's other Latin American destinations include GuatemalaCity; Panama City; San Jose, Costa Rica; Asuncion, Paraguay; Cali,Colombia; and La Paz, Bolivia.</TEXT></DOC>
