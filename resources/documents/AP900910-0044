(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bert Parks' flubbed return to theMiss America pageant was blamed on two pages of his script stickingtogether.   Miss Illinois Marjorie Judith Vincent, a 25-year-old law studentfrom Oak Park, was crowned early Sunday as Miss America 1991.   Parks, fired as emcee 10 years ago for being too old, got astanding ovation at the start of the pageant Saturday night butskipped the names of at least a dozen former Miss Americas duringthe introduction of 29 past winners.   At one point, the 75-year-old crooner also rambled and wasinterrupted by master of ceremonies Gary Collins.   Pageant director Leonard Horn said Sunday he has not decidedwhether to invite Parks back next year but that the blunder wouldnot affect his decision.   ``It's a shame for Bert because he was so excited. ... It's oneof the chances you take with live TV,'' Horn said.   The mistake came when two pages in Park's script stuck together,Horn said. ``I don't have a gut reaction to it,'' the pageantdirector said. ``Apparently he went to card three and skipped cardtwo in his excitement.''   Parks also rambled about raunchy comedians and a good place toeat on the Boardwalk, and he asked America to refer to women as``ladies'' rather than ``chicks.'' Collins took Parks by the armand said it was time to let the contestants speak.   Horn said Parks did not ad-lib too long.   ``It's very unfair of the press to think he was dragged off,''Horn said. ``I thought he was wonderful. He brought an excitementto the show and to this town.''   Reached at home in Greenwich, Conn., Parks' wife, Annette, saidher husband was not available for comment Sunday.   Miss Vincent, a third-year law student at Duke University whowants to practice international law, credited her victory todetermination and a lifelong ambition to participate in the pageant.   She spoke to reporters on the Boardwalk shortly after 7 a.m.Sunday for the traditional ``frolicking in the surf'' picture.   ``If you want to achieve a goal and work for it very hard, youcan achieve it,'' Miss Vincent said in French to the people ofHaiti, from which her parents immigrated.   She chose the plight of battered women as the issue she willemphasize during her reign.   She said she was stunned that she won, finally falling asleep at4 a.m., and wants to celebrate with the cheesecake that waspreviously denied her.   ``I still don't believe I'm here,'' said Miss Vincent, wearingthe pageant's rhinestone tiara and a sapphire blue dress with anolive green, purple and black scarf. ``It still doesn't seem real.''</TEXT></DOC>
