Gold prices were also mixed, rising in New York and dropping inEurope and Asia.   The dollar was up in early trading in New York, following thetrend sent on foreign markets, but then lost some ground. Dealerssaid they had no explanation for the dollar's healthier tone, andshied away from predicting what course the U.S. currency would take.   ``We're trying to decide whether it's a reversal of direction orwhat, and we just don't know,'' said Robert Ryan, chief foreignexchange dealer with Bank of New York Co.   The dollar has slumped in recent weaks because of pessimismabout the U.S. economy and the effect the Persian Gulf crisis couldhave on it.   Dealers said the markets were looking toward the scheduledrelease Friday of the Labor Department's employment figures forAugust. The markets expect the report to confirm that the economyis slowing down and reinforce arguments that U.S. interest ratesmust come down.   Many economists say the U.S. economy is headed into a recessionand the Federal Reserve will move to encourage lower rates. Butsuch a move would be a negative for the dollar, which is supportedby higher interest rates and has struggled lately to competeagainst currencies of nations with higher rates.
