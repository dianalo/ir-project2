<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-1157 </DOCNO><TEXT>The use of proton beam irradiation in neurosurgical clinical practicehelps to find a solution to the problem of the treatment of inoperablemalformations employing this method in some cases as an alternative tosurgical intervention. Methods of ''piercing'' irradiation and methodswith the use of Bragg's peak are being developed. At present over 200patients with hormonally active hypophyseal tumors, 30 patients withtumors of the cavernous sinus, 23 patients with deep seated arteriovenousmalformations, and 10 patients with spontaneous arteriosinusal anastomosesin the cavernous sinus area have been irradiated. This method seems tohold promise in neurosurgical practice. Extension of the range of clinicalapplications of proton beam therapy in neurosurgery requires the developmentof various techniques of irradiation, all possible approaches to varioustargets on the basis of contemporary methods of computerized diagnosis,topometry and irradiation design.</TEXT></DOC>
