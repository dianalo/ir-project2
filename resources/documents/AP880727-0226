(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials checking a teen-ager's reportof a so-called ``Lizard Man'' found large tracks near Scape OreSwamp, and a Bigfoot researcher says the creature is a ``skunkape.''   The search began almost two weeks ago when 17-year-old ChrisDavis says he was chased at speeds up to 40 mph by a tall, wetgreen creature after he changed a tire about 2 a.m. near a beanfield.   Since then, the swamp has been swamped with the curious,including scores of news people, and Lee County Sheriff ListonTruesdale has fielded hundreds of calls about the beast.   ``You're dealing with a skunk ape, which is a colloquial name.You can call it anything you want to, but it's a Bigfoot,'' saidErik Beckjord, who has researched creature sightings for 10 yearsand interviewed Davis.   He said the Lizard Man sounds like the skunk ape that hasreportedly been seen in woods and swamps around the country since1958.   A state trooper and sheriff's deputy on patrol near the swampfound the 14-inch by 7-inch tracks, and the sheriff made five setsof plaster casts of them.   While Truesdale said he believes Davis saw something, itprobably was a bear. He said it's likely a prankster was at workSunday when the tracks were found.   ``Whoever did it, they sure did a convincing job,'' said thesheriff.   The prints were found on a dirt road that parallels the swampand traveled about 400 yards before stomping off into woods,Truesdale said.   The sheriff asked the State Law Enforcement Division to sendbloodhounds to scour the swamp.   ``We couldn't find anybody coming out of there. And if it wassome `thing,' we wanted to see if the dog would trail it,''Truesdale said.   The hounds, however, failed to pick up a scent, probably becauseof an afternoon rainstorm, said SLED spokesman Hugh Munn.   ``They did see tracks. They had three toes and dug down into theground in six-foot strides. ... I can't even say this with astraight face,'' Munn said.   But others have told Truesdale they, too, have seen the red-eyedcreature, and this week the sheriff said he was tracking downreports of tracks seen after a January snowstorm.   The prints found Sunday are the same dimensions as a set foundin 1977 by the D.W. Berry family in Saluda County, officials said.Sheriff's investigators there concluded the prints were made by aprankster.   A week before that, a 12-by-5-inch set of prints was found bythe Leonard Gromoske family in Fort Mill.   Beckjord said skunk apes are harmless, sometimes travel in pairsand quite frequently stink.   ``Florida has more reports of skunk apes than any other state inthe nation,'' added Beckjord, founder of the NationalCryptozoological Society, which records sightings of creatureswhose existence is questioned by scientists.   Beckjord, of Malibu, Calif., said Davis' account of the creaturecoincides with other Bigfoot descriptions except for Lizard Man'sgreen skin. Most Bigfoot sightings are of hairy beasts, and themajority have red eyes like Davis described, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
