Police said Patrolman Leandro Serrano was in his jeep preparingto leave for work in suburban Navotas when five gunmen opened fire,killing him instantly.   The assailants, who escaped, left a note signed by the AlexBoncayao Brigade saying Serrano was slain because he was assigned toa police counterintelligence unit.   The Alex Boncayao Brigade is the Manila wing of the New People'sArmy, which has been waging a 20-year insurgency to establish aCommunist state.   On Mindanao island, 500 miles southeast of Manila, the militarysaid three rebels and three soldiers were killed Monday in Lanao delNorte province.   Three more soldiers died in rebel ambushes the same day in theMindanao provinces of Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Norte,military reports said.   In another development, the military said nine soldiers and fourDefense Department civilians were fired for financial irregularitiesas part of a crackdown on corruption.   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said the 13 dismissedemployees had finance jobs at the Armed Forces General Staff, thecentral Philippine Visayas Command and at the military hospital inQuezon City.   He said all were undergoing investigation to determine if theywould be court-martialed for embezzlement or misappropriation offunds.   The military command has come under increasing pressure fromCongress, the public and the news media to eliminate corruption,which flourished in the 160,000-member army during the 20-yearadministration of President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos was ousted in1986.   Also Wednesday, President Corazon Aquino told reporters she hadapproved in principle a package of reforms and other measures hergovernment will undertake as a condition for $1.3 billion in IMFloans.   She said a ``letter of intent'' accepting the IMF terms will beforwarded to Fund headquarters in Washington after a review by thePhilippine Senate.   Formal approval also will pave the way for $1.6 billion more innew loans from commercial banks and for talks with foreign creditorsto reschedule up to $2 billion of the country's $28 billion foreigndebt.   In its letter of intent, the government pledges to reduce thebudget deficit by improved tax collection, to liberalize importsregulations and to disband or sell off most of its state-ownedbusinesses.   It also agrees to continue a floating exchange rate which hasseen the peso lose about three percent of its value against the U.S.dollar in the past year.   Critics contend the government cannot meet the terms of thepackage without raising prices for electric power, transport andfood.</TEXT></DOC>
