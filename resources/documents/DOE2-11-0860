Pertinent resultsfor these three canisters are presented along with the results for canisterMS-21 which was produced under DWPF conditions in March 1983 using theLSFM melter. Important findings from the measurements of this study areincluded. The maximum canister surface temperature ranged between 470and 500 C for continuously filled canisters, and as high as 552 C fora batch filled canister. The time required for the maximum surface temperatureto decrease to less than 100 C (required before a canister can be decontaminated)ranged from 33 to 36 hours after the pour was stopped. The time requiredfor the maximum glass centerline temperature to decrease to less than500 C ranged from 16 to 17 hours after the pour was stopped for bothcontinuously and batch filled canisters. As noted in prior canister temperaturemeasurements, the canister behaves like an infinite cylinder in termsof heat loss over the canister elevation range of 15 to 75 inches. Asthe glass leaves the melter pour spout and travels through the canister,it cools approximately 30 C per foot. The decrease in glass temperatureas it travels through the canister is not perfectly linear, but thisassumption yields the 30 C per foot value. 8 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
