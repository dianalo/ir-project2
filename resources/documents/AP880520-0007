Thousands of students and dissidents opposed to President RohTae-woo's government battled police in the streets. Protest leadersclaimed South Korea is not a democracy, as they had during theauthoritarian regime of Roh's predecessor and ally, Chun Doo-hwan.   Protesters chanted: ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' and``Destroy the murder regime!'' They hurled firebombs and rocks atriot police during the most violent unrest in months.   The scale was much smaller than the huge protests of last summerbut the scenes and slogans were the same, demonstrating that SouthKorean politics remain turbulent despite the professed desire ofall parties to build a stable democratic system.   Anti-American sentiment, always present in political protests,seemed particularly evident this time.   ``Yankee go home!'' was shouted along with ``Execute RohTae-woo!'' Protesters burned a homemade American flag and attackeda U.S. cultural center. Opposition groups, especially radicalstudents, remain eager to take their causes into the streets. Thegovernment still limits some political activity and is quick to useriot police to break up protests.   Many South Koreans still distrust Roh because he helped Chunseize power in 1980, when both were army generals, and played aprominent role in Chun's regime, serving as chairman of thegovernment Democratic Justice Party.   That wariness was reflected in Roh's slender victory in theDecember presidential election over a divided opposition, and thegovernment party's loss of its majority in parliamentary electionslast month.   Opposition groups demand an investigation of his role insuppression of the 1980 Kwangju uprising, in which at least 191people were killed. This week's protests marked the eighthanniversary, on Wednesday, of the revolt in the southern city.   In addition to being far smaller than those that forced Chun tohold elections, the latest protests have attracted little publicsupport and there is little sign that they will become a threat tothe government.   The 1987 protests mushroomed into mass demonstrations almostovernight, however, and political observers avoid firm predictionsabout South Korean politics. When Roh replaced Chun as president inFebruary, it was the first peaceful transfer of power in thenation's 40-year history.   All indications are that both the government and the mainopposition parties want to avoid major political unrest before theOlympic Games are held here in September. South Koreans see thegames as a national triumph that will give the nation a place onthe world stage.   Roh has worked hard to build public confidence. He promised tointroduce full democracy while ensuring political stability, andhas made significant changes.   Many curbs on politics imposed by Chun have been removed,creating a sharp contrast to 1987, when riot police took harshaction to disperse even minor peace;ful demonstrations.   Roh tries to project himself as a ``common man'' and hasdiscarded much of the presidency's aloofness. Press curbs have beenremoved, most forms of self-expression are allowed and oppositionparties operate freely.   Some political controls still apply, however. Street protestsagainst the government still are likely to be broken up and scoresof dissidents remain in jail, serving long sentences for politicalactivity.   Many South Koreans feel real democracy is not possible untilcontrol by the military, government bureaucracy, big business andother powerful factions is ended.   People in the streets complain that Roh has yet to deliver onelection promises of major social and economic reforms, includingdoubling pay for industrial workers and the poor.   A more fundamental problem lies in the traditional South Koreanbelief that compromise is the greatest sign of weakness. Politicalfactions believe only one point of view is right and all othersmust be defeated or even destroyed.   Political leaders on all sides agree such an outlook blocks theroad to democracy, but seem unable to change it.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Renfrew, Associated Press bureau chief inSeoul, has covered Asia for five years.</TEXT></DOC>
