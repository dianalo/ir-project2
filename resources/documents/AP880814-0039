Thornburghexpressed little enthusiasm Sunday for Edwin Meese's last-minuteorder to have independent counsels investigate wrongdoing inCongress, and said he saw only ``a very limited role'' for suchspecial prosecutors.   Meese's final act Friday as attorney general was to sign anorder for special prosecutors to investigate criminal allegationsagainst members of Congress. Democratic lawmakers called it thevindictive act of a man who had himself been investigated by twosuch prosecutors.   Meese said he had discussed the order with Thornburgh and added,``I believe he agrees with it.''   But Thornburgh, questioned on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''declined to say whether he would go along with the order.   ``I haven't had an opportunity to review the order,'' he saidfrom Boston, adding: ``I think there should be a very limited rolefor so-called special prosecutors or independent counsels.''   Thornburgh, a former Pennsylvania governor, headed the JusticeDepartment's criminal division during the Ford administration inthe mid-1970s and established the public integrity section thatprosecutes corrupt public officials.   He said the public integrity office has ``done a first-classjob'' in tracking down official corruption _ ``federal, state orlocal, wherever it may be.''   ``Obviously, the attorney general who preceded me had somereason for enunciating this order and I want to take a look at thatand give it due consideration. But the fact of the matter is thatif the evidence is there, investigations and prosecutions will beundertaken against anyone who violates the federal criminal laws,be they congressmen or ordinary citizens,'' Thornburgh said.   The new attorney general said he was aware of ``conflictingreports about the state of morale and commitment within thedepartment,'' an apparent reference to the furor caused by theresignation of top officials during the waning days of Meese'stenure.   Thornburgh said he had not discussed with Vice President GeorgeBush whether he would stay on if Bush is elected president.   ``I regard this as a job I'm going to do one day at a time,''Thornburgh said.   He also called ``very flattering'' speculation that he is in therunning for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket but added: ``Ihave a job to do for this president and unless I've heard anythingfrom the vice president, I'm ready to go to work as attorneygeneral of the United States.''   Thornburgh, 56, took office as the 76th attorney general Friday,succeeding Meese, who resigned after saying he had been vindicatedby an independent counsel investigation of his affairs.   Independent counsel James McKay concluded that Meese``probably'' broke the law but decided not to seek his indictment.Meese denied any improprieties and maintained that the departmentwas running normally despite defections by top aides during hisfinal months as attorney general.</TEXT></DOC>
