Under cumulative voting, each of a holder's shares has as many votes as there are directors to be elected, and the holder may distribute these votes as he wishes. Cumulative voting thus works to the advantage of dissident holders trying to gain board representation.    Pandamp;G said the change wasn't prompted by any efforts by holders to change the makeup of its board.    But John Smale, Pandamp;G's chairman and chief executive, used the meeting to speak at length about hostile takeovers in general. He maintained that too often they leave companies loaded with debt and shrunken research budgets and ignore the interests of employees and the communities in which the companies do business. He also argued that, over the long run, hostile takeovers don't &quot;necessarily provide a good mechanism for shareholders to realize full value for their shares.&quot;    Mr. Smale said: &quot;There is, of course, nothing new about a corporation's fundamental responsibility to its owners. What is new is the role of what I'll call the 'temporary' owner . . . whose interest is solely that of a speculator looking for the 'fast buck.'&quot;    Federal law should &quot;increase disclosure obligations&quot; of parties that accumulate blocks of stock, Mr. Smale said, and &quot;restrict certain manipulative practices in the tender offer process.&quot; He didn't give specifics, but a company spokesman said Pandamp;G expects to continue lobbying for various anti-takeover proposals in Washington.    Mr. Smale also said that the role of the states in curbing abuses in takeovers should be preserved and that the role of directors should be enhanced. The vote on cumulative voting followed a 1986 change in an Ohio law that had previously prohibited the elimination of cumulative voting.    At the meeting, holders rejected a proposal that Pandamp;G return to annual election of all its directors. Holders in 1985 voted to divide directors into three classes with overlapping three-year terms.    Holders also rejected a proposal intended to curb the use of animals in Pandamp;G's product testing. </TEXT></DOC>
