Manguno (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Chun Doo Hwan, in an effort to head off mounting calls that he be investigated for corruption, resigned two quasi-official positions and apologized for wrongdoing by his younger brother.    In what appeared to be the culmination of a long power struggle between Mr. Chun and his handpicked successor, President Roh Tae Woo, the former president called a sudden news conference at his suburban home here yesterday. He announced he was stepping down as chairman of the Advisory Council of Elder Statesmen, a position he sought to build into a power base before handing over the presidency Feb. 25 to Mr. Roh. He also resigned as honorary president of the ruling Democratic Justice Party, or DJP, which he created in 1981 to legitimize the power he seized in a 1979 coup.    Mr. Chun said he will remain a regular member of the DJP, without any official position, and will lead the life of an &quot;ordinary citizen&quot; -- a phrase Mr. Roh coined during his campaign last year to describe the role the unpopular Mr. Chun would play after his term ended.    While the ruling party and leading government officials endorsed the former president's action, they denied President Roh struck a deal promising not to prosecute Mr. Chun if he would bow out of public life. The spotlight has been on Mr. Chun since his brother was arrested March 30 after confessing partial guilt in a bribery, embezzlement and influence-peddling scandal at the Saemaul Undong Movement Headquarters, a government-supported rural-development agency he headed during his brother's seven-year rule. Nine of his colleagues also have been arrested.    President Roh, whose ruling party faces a major test against three opposition parties in National Assembly elections April 26, has sought to avoid any appearance of cover-up by demanding a full investigation of the Chuns.    &quot;There was no deal,&quot; a member of Mr. Roh's cabinet said. &quot;And anyway, I really don't think President Chun committed any wrongdoing that can be prosecuted.&quot; A former Chun cabinet official added that the investigation of the Chun family already under way &quot;should go, and probably will go, as far as the facts take it.&quot;    But other sources said an agreement was reached between the former president and the new government not to &quot;hound him into prison,&quot; as a DJP official put it. &quot;The Korean people don't want to see the former chief executive dragged through investigations,&quot; a leading business executive close to Mr. Chun said. &quot;They just want him to go away -- the farther the better.&quot;    Mr. Chun seems to be trying to oblige. He also said he asked the beleaguered Ilhae Foundation, a research institute created in 1984 at his behest by Korea's leading businessmen, to change its name. Ilhae is Mr. Chun's pen name. Critics repeatedly have charged Ilhae has been used by the former president to channel ill-gotten wealth of his family and cronies into securities, property investments and secret bank accounts. Ilhae officials deny the allegations, but the foundation, in which Mr. Chun hasn't any official position, is under scrutiny by state prosecutors.    The former president said he was taking the actions outlined yesterday to show that he regrets and accepts responsibility for the &quot;wrongdoing&quot; of his brother, 45-year-old Chun Kyung Hwan. State prosecutors are studying many other alleged irregularities involving Mr. Chun's close friends and family. Korean officials noted that it is custom in Korean society for someone in Mr. Chun's position to take responsibility for his brother's alleged wrongdoing.    But some DJP officials indicated that Mr. Chun's action represented much more. One official said the government definitely made a deal with Mr. Chun and cited as proof the resignations of two Chun loyalists from the Advisory Council of Elder Statesmen shortly after Mr. Chun's. &quot;The arrangement was that he not only had to leave, but he had to take his staff with him.&quot; Mr. Chun, one DJP official said, fought the resignations, &quot;believing he could just ride out the storm.&quot;    Even before Mr. Chun stepped down, Roh loyalists were struggling to distance themselves from the former president and scuttle his attempts to retain power over the new government through the Council of Elder Statesmen.    Those attempts led to what some DJP officials now concede was a power struggle between Chun and Roh loyalists before Mr. Roh took office. But a former Chun government official said there was &quot;nothing approaching a power struggle after the inauguration of the new president.&quot;    Others say Mr. Roh has been walking a fine line in the post-Chun period between his own political interests and loyalty to the old friend and fellow general whom he helped bring to power in 1979.    DJP officials denied a widespread belief here that the Roh government has leaked information to the Korean media about prosecutors' investigations of the Chun family. They said the newly aggressive Korean press, which was severely restricted under the Chun regime, was independently investigating reports of alleged misconduct and corruption. </TEXT></DOC>
