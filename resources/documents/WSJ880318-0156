Mr. Oberman already manages Oppenheimer's Global Fund and runs its new Biotechnology Fund. &quot;Switching from biotech to gold -- going from DNA strands to heavy metals -- can be disconcerting,&quot; he says.    Even tougher, Mr. Oberman had to succeed last year's top mutual fund manager, Milton Berg, and take charge of the best-performing precious metals portfolio, Oppenheimer's Gold andamp; Special Minerals Fund. What's more, the gold market, which had risen for much of 1987, had turned sour. Gold funds, last year's top-performing mutual fund group, had sunk to the cellar in 1988.    &quot;It doesn't make things any easier knowing one thing when you take over you're not going to do as well as the other guy,&quot; says a former Oppenheimer associate. &quot;That turns up the pressure a bit.&quot;    The pressure is even greater at Oppenheimer, where last year's stellar funds have been touted in full-page newspaper advertisements. Three of those top funds were run by Mr. Berg, who quit Oppenheimer early this year for a higher-paying job at Steinhardt Partners, a New York investment firm.    Yet so far Mr. Oberman has held his own in a difficult environment. The Gold andamp; Special Minerals Fund has been one of only two gold-oriented funds to eke out a gain this year, gaining 1.13% through last week, compared with a loss of 9.23% for gold funds as a group, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.    Mr. Oberman's strategy and personality are far different from those of his predecessor. The fast-talking Mr. Berg racked up much of the fund's gains from a nimble trading philosophy and an anti-gold stance. &quot;Gold stocks by any valuation are way overpriced,&quot; Mr. Berg says; as a result, he quickly traded in and out of the market, often investing in non-precious metals and buying puts (giving him the right to sell shares at a set price for a specified time) on signs of a gold-price downturn.    The more easygoing Mr. Oberman has a much longer-term investing outlook. &quot;I'm not a trader,&quot; he says. When he likes a stock, he usually sticks with it for many years.    Mr. Oberman defends his strategy, stressing that he looks for precious metals companies that will increase output over the long haul. Two current favorites are the South African platinum producers Impala and Rustenberg Holdings; in the past few weeks, he has doubled his platinum position to 5% of the portfolio. &quot;Even if prices aren't strong, I'll get bailed out by earnings growth from increased production,&quot; he says.    He also expects more of the fund's future gains to come from gold. Right now, he says he's looking at Australia for attractive gold-stock opportunities. &quot;If inflation starts to accelerate, there's no better place to be in than in gold,&quot; he says.    Although Mr. Oberman wasn't involved in gold investing the past few years, he helped design Oppenheimer's Gold andamp; Special Mineral Fund when it was launched in the early 1980s. In fact, he was its first manager, before Mr. Berg. And he says his international contacts from running the Global Fund since 1981 will help him in the precious metals area.    Either way, he's known for his hard work. Says James McClure, former Oppenheimer chief executive and currently president of National Securities andamp; Research Corp: &quot;He usually leaves work in the afternoon with a canvas bag with about five pounds of reading material and comes back with an empty bag in the morning.&quot;    Still, Mr. Oberman might not have much time to prove his point. Fund officials say the precious metals move is probably an interim one, that Mr. Oberman is simply smoothing the way for a successor. Oppenheimer President Jon Fossel couldn't be reached to comment. Mr. Oberman, for his part, says it will depend on how things develop within the organization.    &quot;If Oppenheimer brings in someone with good experience, as it did when Milton came, I'd be very happy to tip-toe out the door,&quot; he says. &quot;There's always something else I can do.&quot;    ---   Money Fund Assets Drop   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 421 money market funds fell $492.9 million to $279.53 billion in the week ended Wednesday.
