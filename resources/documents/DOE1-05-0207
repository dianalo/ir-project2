Itsobjective is the removal of and the prevention of buildup of calciumcarbonate scale inside the bore of a geothermal well which inhibits extractionand production during the development of geothermal energy. (1) Concerningthe technology of removing scale, the development of calipers was adoptedwhich measure precisely the scale buildup conditions in the bore of ageothermal well and the developed calipers were assessed to be well serviceable.(2) Concerning the development of the preventative technology of scalebuidup, the method was confirmed to select efficiently the proper depressorof scale buildup in accordance with various characters of hot water throughthe analysis of the depressing mechanism of scale buildup and a selectioncriteria table could be prepared.
