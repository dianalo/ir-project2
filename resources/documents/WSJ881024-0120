The bill would eliminate the proposed so-called phantom income rule. That clause would have required mutual funds to report their expenses as income to holders, even though the investors never would have received the money. Such expenses then would have been deductible for the holders only to the extent that they, plus other miscellaneous deductions, exceeded 2% of adjusted gross income.    Mutual fund investors had been granted a one-year reprieve from the proposed rule last year; the latest bill extends the reprieve for as long as two years.    Exorcising the phantom won't save holders big bucks, but is considered a big psychological victory by mutual fund officials. Consider an investor with $10,000 in mutual funds. Assuming annual fund expenses of about 1%, which amounts to about $100, means paying taxes of only $33 for someone in the 33% tax bracket.    &quot;For the average investor, it wouldn't make that much of a difference,&quot; said Steven Norwitz, a vice president for T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., a Baltimore mutual fund group. But the clause was controversial, he said, because it would have involved taxing holders on income they never received. &quot;Maybe if you have $50,000 in an account it would begin to add up,&quot; Mr. Norwitz said.    The removal of the proposed bill will be most felt by the elderly, who own a disproportionately large amount of mutual funds, industry officials said.    &quot;It is a particular relief to older shareholders who depend on funds for a substantial portion of income,&quot; said David Silver, president of the Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group.    Meanwhile, the biggest problem with the phantom proposal would have been explaining it to holders, some fund officials said. It wasn't clear, for instance, which expenses would have been taxed. &quot;We would have upped expenses just in explaining it (the proposed rule) to shareholders,&quot; said Brian Mattes, a vice president for Vanguard Group, a low-cost mutual fund vendor based in Valley Forge, Pa. </TEXT></DOC>
