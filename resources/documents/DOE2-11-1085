The overall conversion yieldwas 62% wt daf at 400 degrees C. Though the coal underwent only a slightincrease at 450 degrees C. (67% wt daf), there was a marked change inthe product slates. Oil yields increased from 17% wt daf to 40% wt dafover this temperature range, and asphaltene yields were noted to changeradically and pass through a maximum. It appears that the oils are largelyresponsible for the production of asphaltenes either through solvationof the coal products or through hydrogenation of the oils to form anactive hydrogen donor solvent.</TEXT></DOC>
