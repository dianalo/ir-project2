(asubsidiary of Ziff Communications Corp., publisher of PC Magazine).andP;  It's notcheap, with a $24-per-hour surcharge added to the $12 per hour billed byCompuServe.andP;  In addition, any full-text article you print to screen costs anextra $1.50; abstracts, which can be lengthy, cost $1.andP;  But if you save oldissues, the search facility may be all you need.andM;The software guides you through searches with menu choices.andP;  You can take abroad scattershot approach or use a more scientific method.andM;To begin your search with a wide net, you can choose to sift through everysingle word in the database for any term, product name, or person.andP;  You cancombine terms, use wildcards, and do proximity searches.andM;For instance, I set out to find references to 1-2-3 macros that dealt withamortization.andP;  I began the search by selecting, from the menu, a search forwords occurring anywhere.andP;  It prompted me for the search term, so I enteredmacro* and [1 2 3 and 123]andM;In 11 seconds, I was told that there were 943 references.andP;  Then I chose tonarrow the search, this time adding &quot;amortiz*&quot; to the search string.andP;  Now Ihad a more digestible list of 23 hits to look at.andP;  When I entered &quot;S1,&quot; Ireceived a scrolling list of the 23 references with issue dates and numbers.andM;You won't need any help to find your way through the Computer Database Plusmenu options, but it helps to have a modicum of CompuServe savvy.andP;  Forinstance, it helps to know that entering M will bring you back to the menuyou last selected; and prefacing any menu choice with S will get yourresponse scrolling quickly, instead of pacing in, screen by screen.andP;  Ifthings are going by too quickly, enter Ctrl-S to suspend a scrolling screen(hitting any key will start it up again); and type Ctrl-C to cancel aninstruction that's executing.andM;Right now, the help files stored on Computer Database Plus are less thanuseful: they're confusing.andP;  Fortunately, improvements are in the works.andO;While you'll find all of the articles in PC Magazine covered, you can't getat features tables and code listings just yet.andP;  Some tables will be added incoming months as binary downloads; program code and executable utilities arefrom PC Magazine stories is available now on PC MagNet.andM;Computer Database Plus's performance speed is probably equivalent to ComputerLibrary, the CD-ROM also published by Ziff Communications (see First Looks,page 46, PC Magazine, January 17, 1989); Computer Database Plus has theadvantage of going back longer than the 1 year that Computer Libraryprovides.andM;Computer Database Plus is a research tool, but it's probably going to be mostuseful as a way to better use old issues of PC Magazine and the othercomputer publications you read.andM;The ultimate test, I suppose, is whether you can find what you're looking forfaster by dialing into Computer Database Plus or by poring through your backissues until you find the right page in the right issue.andP;  And that's a testof your own memory.andM;How to Join Computer DatabaseandM;Plus and PC MagNetandM;You need to be a member of either PC MagNet, PC Magazine's on-lineinteractive service, or CompuServe to use Computer Database Plus.andP;  Whenyou're ready to join, you'll need to have your credit card at hand, yourmodem turned on, and your communications software cranked up.andM;Set your communications protocol at 7E1 (7 data bits, even parity, one stopbit), and your modem at either 300 or 1,200 bits per second.andM;There are more than 500 phone numbers (at least one in every area code) butchoose one of these for now: Boston, (617) 542-1796; Chicago, (312) 693-0330;New York, (212) 422-8820; or San Francisco, (415) 956-4191.andM;Have your software dial one of the numbers.andM;When the modem connects, press Ctrl-C.andP;  At the HOST NAME prompt, enter CIS.andO;At the USER ID prompt, enter 177000,5000.andP;  At the PASSWORD prompt, enterPC*MAGNET.andP;  At the ENTER USER AGREEMENT NUMBER prompt, enter Z10D8903.andM;You're now in PC MagNet and can join conversations between readers and theeditors, download utilities and batch files, or select the Computer DatabasePlus prompt from the menu.andP;  If you need to find a 2,400-bps access number orone in your hometown, enter GO PHONES from any prompt.andM;After you've used Computer Database Plus, you can return to PC MagNet byentering CO PCMAGNET at any prompt.andM;To sign off, enter BYE at any prompt.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
