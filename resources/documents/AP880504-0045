Levy was referring to the 1982Israeli invasion of Lebanon that led to a three-year occupation.   Israeli troops on Monday night launched their largest operationin Lebanon in two years, moving north of Israel's self-designated``security zone'' to search for Arab guerrillas.   The incursion followed a week in which Palestinian guerrillastwice penetrated Israel's northern border, illing two Israelisoldiers. Five guerrillas also were killed.   Since then, residents say, life in northern border settlementshas become more tense.   ``Fewer people leave their homes at night. They jump at everylittle sound,'' said Amos Or, secretary of Kibbutz Dafna, anothercommunal farm about one mile from the border.   Or said his children had taken to playing ``soldiers andguerrillas'' after last week's raids.   ``They put rags on their heads and pretended they wereguerrillas on a hostage-taking mission,'' he said.   When the alert was sounded last week indicating a possibleguerrilla infiltration, residents of the communal farms went into apracticed routine they have come to know all too well over theyears.   Women locked themselves into their small, one-story homes withthe children for a nerve-wracking vigil until the guerrillas werecaught.   The men grabbed weapons they keep in their homes and headed forfences or watchtowers to guard their settlement.   Kibbutzniks, as residents are called, have learned importantlessons from past guerrilla attacks.   They remember vividly the night of Nov. 25, 1987 when a lonePalestinian guerrilla landed a hang glider inside the border, madehis way to an army post and killed six soldiers before being shotto death.   ``During that night, we learned how hard it was for the women inthe houses to stay alone without knowing what was going on,'' Levysaid. Since then, he said, the kibbutz has set up a hot linestaffed by volunteers and a social worker who people can call whena real alert is on.   Levy described elaborate exercises held jointly with the armyevery few months, in which a hostage-taking operation is staged atKfar Szold.   ``Every few months the army takes a house, shoots a little bitin the air, then takes a few hostages here,'' Levy said.   He said each kibbutz in the region had prepared for the worst bytraining a team of Arabic-speaking residents to negotiate withguerrillas, in case a hostage situation developed before the armyarrived.   In other exercises, kibbutzniks practice storming a guerrillaoutpost in an area outside the settlement, Levy said.   Similar training exercises have become a part of life inMetulla, a border town of 1,500 overlooking the hills of southernLebanon.   ``Everybody under 65 years of age has a job,'' said BialikBelski, owner of the town's Arazim hotel. He said tasks range fromtransporting the elderly into shelters to standing guard at theedge of town.   Yossi Goldberg, head of Metulla's city council, commended thearmy's defense of the northern settlements. But he complained thegovernment had not fulfilled its obligations to the town, where``50 percent of our problems are security-related.''   Goldberg said Metulla badly needs a medical clinic, because thenearest hospital is an hour's drive away, in the northern town ofZefat. He said Metulla had been promised more psychologists to helpresidents deal with fears of attack, but none had been provided.   ``The government has made a lot of promises it hasn't kept,''Goldberg said. ``We expect the government to take care of itscitizens.''   When the army launched its search operation Monday night,residents in Kibbutz Kfar Szold were relieved.   ``It can only help if they clean up the place once in a while,''Levy said. ``I hope it will do something.''   Along with sighs of relief came skepticism that the operationwould have any long-term impact.   ``There will be a deterrent effect for some time, but then ...the guerrilla activity will just increase again,'' Or said.   ``There is no alternative to going in after the guerrillas,''Belski said. ``But they will come back. Every minister in thegovernment knows that.''</TEXT></DOC>
