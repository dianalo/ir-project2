(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Dan Quayle, making a bid for thefarmers' vote and attacking Democrat Michael Dukakis as weak ondefense policies, got his best reception of the presidentialcampaign from a group of college students that treated hisappearance as a pep rally.   About 800 cheering students at the University of Central Floridacheered Quayle on Friday as he stood near a school mascot with ahuge papier mache bust of George Bush and sounded themes of astrong national defense, economic prosperity and a promising future.   The students had their football season opener Friday night, andgave Quayle the most enthusiastic crowd reception to date since hebecame the Republican vice presidential nominee.   GOP strategists are hoping the youthful senator will appeal tocollege-age voters, and Quayle has said he hopes the youngergeneration will identify with him.   In one of the more exuberant exchanges, Quayle began to tell thecrowd that he had served on the Senate Armed Services Committee foreight years.   ``Eight proud years,'' interjected a voice from the crowd as theaudience cheered.   An obviously delighted Quayle turned to the voice and shouted,``Eight proud years.''   The only negative notes of the day were sounded by a small groupof Dukakis supporters outside the rally who held signs reading``Quayle Is a Turkey'' and ``Women Don't Vote for Men Prettier ThanThey Are.''   Quayle travels to Newnan, Ga., today for an appearance at anarts and crafts fair, before going to Columbia, S.C., for afootball game tonight between the University of South Carolina andthe University of North Carolina.   The Indiana senator appeared more confident Friday in hiscampaign than at any time in the past two rocky weeks.   At appearances in Montgomery, Ala., he attacked Dukakis, theDemocratic presidential nominee, as ``flat wrong'' on defenseissues, and made a strong appeal for the farm vote by telling theAlabama Farmers Federation and Insurance Cos. that U.S. farmersshould not have to compete against ``illegal subsidies'' of goodsproduced by other countries.   ``As long as we can get that level playing field, the Americanfarmer will outproduce and be more competitive than any farmers inthe world,'' Quayle said.   At a Montgomery rally, Quayle said the two tickets disagreedmost sharply in their approach to national defense issues.   ``We believe in a strong national defense to deter aggressionagainst America; and he (Dukakis) does not. On matters of nationaldefense and foreign policy, believe me, our opponent is not evenhalf right; he's just flat wrong,'' Quayle said.   Quayle said Dukakis needed ``some education about the defense ofAmerica,'' because of his opposition to the Star Wars space-baseddefense system, the MX missile and other weapons systems.</TEXT></DOC>
