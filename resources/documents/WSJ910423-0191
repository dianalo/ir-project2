Itcould be the tax revolt's going global.   Mr. Kohl's conservative party lost control of the state ofRhineland-Palatinate for the first time in 44 years. And itlost it to the Social Democrats who, of all things,campaigned against the &quot;Bonn tax lie.&quot; After making a pledgeagainst new taxes, widely feared by the public in the wake ofGerman reunification, Mr. Kohl proceeded to enact a one-yearincome-tax surcharge of 7.5% and a scheduled increase in thevalue-added tax.</LP><TEXT>   It is interesting to contemplate the politicalconsiderations that led Helmut Kohl to violate his taxpledge.   There is a fairly wide consensus about what ails eastGermany. Backward east German firms simply aren't ready tobear the cost and regulatory burdens of their westerncounterparts. The Bonn government essentially had threechoices. It could liberalize the German labor market; itcould subsidize east German wages; or it could basically donothing and simply swallow the welfare costs of massivelayoffs.   The first choice would have enlisted market forces in eastGerman recovery. Labor costs would have fallen slightlythroughout Germany, giving manufacturers incentive to hire.Enjoying residual benefits of low costs, east German firmswould have caught up quickly. But liberalization would haveoffended German labor unions, which remain rigid and wouldresist the precedent of a decline in real wages anywhere inGermany, no matter how exceptional the circumstances in theeast.   The second option would have really offended taxpayers,who would have to pay for subsidies. Moreover, thesesubsidies would have been permanent. The subsidies would makelabor artificially cheap, thereby favoring labor-intensivemanufacturing techniques. If the government ever cut off thesubsidies, then firms would switch to more capital intensivemethods, and the layoffs merely would be delayed.   The government chose the third option. Withoutjob-creating market forces, or subsidies, the do-nothingoption means widespread layoffs. In the short term, welfarepayments are high. The taxpayers, not unreasonably, areangry. But whereas the subsidies would be permanent andescalating, the welfare costs will drop if east Germanyrecovers. Mr. Kohl probably figured he would lose a few localelections, but in the long run he'd be better off.   Mr. Kohl's strategy backfires if he buckles now andswitches to subsidies. He'd get the worst of both worlds --short-term welfare costs and long-term subsidies costs. Butit also backfires if east Germany doesn't recover andunemployment lingers. That could happen, given thebureaucratic drag on privatization. As Salomon Brotherseconomists John Lipsky and Thomas Mayer pointed out recently,&quot;the authorities effectively have chosen to put privatizationof `socialized' property at the end, rather than at thebeginning, of east Germany's economic restructuring.&quot;   To salvage east Germany, Chancellor Kohl might have to goback and use the liberalizing strategy he has shied from. Heshould have done the right thing in the first place. And,like his counterparts in the U.S., he shouldn't have fooledhimself into thinking that taxpayers wouldn't notice or mind.Today, they do.</TEXT></DOC>
