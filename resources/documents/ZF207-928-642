 The Sparcstation 1 isboth faster and less expensive than the Sun-4/110, its logical predecessor inSun Microsystems' product line.andP;  Sparcstation 1 prices range from $8995 to$19,995 for packaged systems listed in the Sun catalog; larger Sparcstationconfigurations can cost $30,000 or more.andP;  Sun announced the Sparcstation 1 inApril 1989 and it is currently sold as a workstation.andP;  For serverapplications, Sun has other new products (the Sun-4/330 and Sun-4/370) itrecommends.andM;The sparcstation 1 is binary-compatible with Sun's other Sparc-basedproducts, so applications are transportable across all Sun Sparc systems.andP;  Itappears that the only differences between the operating system used on theSparcstation 1 and that used on other Sparc systems are related to how theirmemory-management sections work.andP;  Thus, the operating system itself isslightly different from that used on other Sun RISC products, but thedifferences are transparent to all Sparc-based applications.andM;At first inspection, the system-level specifications for the Sparcstation 1seem conventional.andP;  The base system includes 8 MB of RAM (expandable to 16MB), an SCSI interface, two serial ports, Ethernet, and three expansionslots.andP;  It can also be equipped with one or two internal hard-disk drives.andO;This listing of features, however, belies th e true expansion capability ofthe system.andM;The Sparcstation 1 is based on a Sparc RISC processor and a Weitekfloating-point chip, both running at 20 MHz.andP;  This is faster than the 16 MHzchips found on the older Sun-4/260.andP;  The processor and floating-point chipsare located on a physically small motherboard in the system chassis.andP;  Thisboard is very impressive, given its very small size and the incredibly lowchip count it needs to run a machine with the Sparcstation 1's power.andP;  Alsofound on the motherboard are an Ethernet interface, two serial ports, and anSCSI-2 interface to external disk drives.andP;  The motherboard also contains a 64KB cache.andM;The base Sparcstation 1 system also inludes a keyboard and a mouse.andP;  Themouse is the Sun-standard optical three-button mouse, essentially the same ashas been included with all previous Sun systems.andP;  The keyboard, with a totalof 107 keys, is the new Sun standard, the same as is used on Sun386i systems.andO;In both layout and feel, it is a vast improvement over the keyboards shippedwith earlier Sun-3 and Sun-4 systems.andP;  Although the layout is still uniquelySun's, the keyboard is now a solid part of the computer system.andM;Also inlcuded on the motherboard is an audio input/output port.andP;  We have notmade use of this feature, which allows an audio signal to be encoded orplayed back, but we have noticed that the internal speaker of theSparcstation 1 provides audio quality that is very impressive.andM;The motherboard also has 16 sockets for SIMM memory modules.andP;  The base systemcomes with eight 1 MB SIMM modules, leaving the other eight open forexpansion to a maximum of 16 MB of RAM.andP;  The SIMM modules must be inserted inmultiples of four because each SIMM holds 1 MB x 8 bits of data, while thememory bus uses a 32-bit-wide path.andP;  Although the fact is apparently notpublicized, we have been told by reliable sources in Sun's sales and servicedepartments that the SIMM module sockets are wired so that they will support4 MB SIMM modules once these become available.andP;  This means that, in thefuture, the current Sparcstation 1 should be able to support up to 64 MB ofRAM in the system unit.andP;  Any user to whom such future RAM expansion potentialis crucial should, of course, verify with local Sun sales offices that theSparcstatin 1 will actually have this capacity.andP;  We personally have yet tosee documentation of it in Sun's literature.andM;The Sparcstation 1 can have one or two internal 104 MB hard-disk drives.andO;These are 3-1/2-inch SCSI drives that connect directly to the motherboard.andO;Because of the size of the operating system, a Sparcstation 1 with a singlelocal 104 MB drive would not be a very useful system unless connected to anetwork.andP;  Sparcstations can be diskless, using a server for all files, orthey can have full local-disk support.andP;  Sun only sells systems containingeither no hard drive or two 104 MB units, but individual drives can bepurchased and added to a diskless node.andP;  A single drive would certainly helpsolve paging problems that might slow down a diskless node.andM;The Sun Sparcstation 1 also supports an internal 3-1/2-inch, 1.44 MB floppydrive.andP;  This peripheral, like the hard-disk drives, connects directly to thesystem motherboard.andP;  External expansion is accomplished via the SCSI-2 bus,allowing both SCSI tapes and SCSI hard disks to be connected.andP;  TheSparcstation 1 supports the 150 MB tape format, and multiple 327 MB hard-diskdrives.andM;Finally, there are three &quot;S-bus&quot; expansion slots in the Sparcstation 1.andO;Every unit uses one or two of these slots as a video interface.andP;  The GXgraphics color display option is a double-wide card using two adjacent slots,while the monochrome display adapter uses only one slot.andP;  Because the &quot;S-bus&quot;is a new device (first used on the Sparcstations), there are relatively fewother options available for it at this time.andM;Sparcstations are available with 17-inch or 19-inch monochrome monitors, orwith 16-inch or 19-inch color monitors.andP;  The selection of the monitor must bemade in conjunction with the proper video board, however, and three differentvideo cards are available from Sun.andP;  These incude a monochrome card, a colorcard, and an accelerated-performance color card.andP;  Standard resolution on allSparcstation 1 video cards for all graphics displays is 1152 x 900 pixels.andM;The Sparcstation 1 system chassis measures 2.8 x 16 x 16 inches, and thetotal weight is not excessive.andP;  The monitor, weighing in at 50 pounds ormore, is substantially heavier and larger than the Sparcstation 1 system unititself.andM;The Sparcstation 1 comes with a license to use SunOS, Sun's UNIX version.andO;Bundled with the SunOS are a C compiler, windowing packages, and networksoftware, among other software features.andP;  A full range of software packagesand applications, including both scientific and business applications, isalso available.andP;  Optional languages include FORTRAN, Pascal, Modula-2, LISP,and Ada.andP;  Optional graphics libraries include PHIGS and GKS.andP;  Sun has a largecatalog listing third-party software packages that will run on anySparc-based system.andM;One of the few software products lacking at the time this review was writtenwas an X11 product from Sun.andP;  Sun has merged X11 and its News windowingsystem into one product, which is scheduled for release around the time thisreview is published, but at the time of this writing Sun does not directlysupport any X11 product.andM;The system tested for this review is a standard Sun-4/60 (again, a.k.a.andP;  theSparcstation 1) with a 16-inch color monitor, the GX graphics option, and 8MB of RAM.andP;  Also included in the system are an external 327 MB hard-diskdrive and 150 MB tape drive, both mounted in a single desktop enclosure.andO;Software includes the base SunOS and the optional FORTRAN compiler.andP;  Thetotal price of $23,795 for this configuration breaks down as follows: $14,995for the diskettes Sparcstation 1 with the GX graphics option, plus $7000 forthe 327 MB disk and 150 MB tape option, $600 for the SunOS media anddocumentation, and $1200 for the FORTRAN compiler.andP;  Note that thisconfiguration contains no internal peripherals; it instead uses the externalSCSI bus for both tape and disk devices.andM;PurchasingandM;Sun Microsystems maintains sales offices around the world, and theSparcstation 1 can be ordered through any of these offices.andP;  In addition,there are a number of Sun value-added resellers that sell Sparcstations.andO;There are also some computer retail stores that now sell the Sparcstation 1,and the number of these retailers seems to be on the rise.andM;Pricing varies with the source, as does the quality of the configurationassistance and advice provided.andP;  Sparcstations do not, at this time, appearto be discounted very much through any of the sales channels.andM;At the time we ordered the unit we tested, delivery was a problem.andP;  It tookroughly eight weeks from order date to system delivery, which is much longerthan required for delivery of most comparable systems.andP;  Clearly, part of theproblem was, and remains, high demand.andP;  In addition, the Sparcstation 1 is anewer system that was then just going into production.andP;  Whether, and howmuch, the shipping delay situation improves in the future is going to dependboth Sun's manufacturing capabilities and the particular sales channelthrough which the Sparcstation 1 is purchased.andM;InstallationandM;Hardware installation for the Sparcstation 1 is trivial.andP;  The units areremoved from their boxes, cabled together, and power is applied to completeinstallation.andP;  A power-on diagnostic is always run automatically, and it ishard to imagine serious hardware installation problems other thanalways-possible but rare initial machine failures.andP;  Given the hefty weight ofthe Sparcstation 1 monitor, however, installation is a two-person operation.andM;Meanwhile, software installation too is becoming a less important issue forusers as Sun and other companies begin to preinstall the operating system.andO;Installation of optional products, such as FORTRAN, can best be done via alocal tape drive, but even installation across a network from a remote tapedrive is easy.andP;  Installation instructions are short and clear.andM;Despite a Sun document stating that all Sparcstation 1s shipped with a diskdrive will have the operating system preinstalled, ours did not.andP;  Sun'sliterature really should state that all systems shipped with internal diskdrives will come with the OS preinstalled, as this is the actual case.andP;  Butinstallation of the entire operating system has become about as easy as itcan be, with plenty of installation aids in the current version of SunOS.andO;Sun has done a good job of improving the ease of installation, mainly byimproving its installation scripts over earlier versions.andM;Start-to-finish installation time, including loading the operating system, isunder three hours if no hardware problems are encountered.andP;  If the operatingsystem is preinstalled, as on most Sparcstation configurations, an hour isprobably sufficient for total system installation.andM;Support and DocumentationandM;When it arrived, our system was unable to communicate with the Ethernet LAN.andO;To solve this problem, and for one other question, we used Sun's toll-freesupport and service phone number.andP;  We were impressed.andM;In previous years, we found that at times our phone calls to Sun wentunanswered, that information was hard to get and was not always accurate--inother words, we had generally unpleasant experiences with the Sun hotline.andM;But this time, all of our phone calls were returned within 30 minutes, theinformation offered was accurate, the people seemed helpful, and all our theproblems were solved quickly and completely.andP;  When the Ethernet problem wasdiagnosed as a hardware problem on the motherboard, the replacement unit forthe defective main logic board arrived in 24 hours for exchange.andP;  This is theway a service organization should be run, and it indicates there have beensubstantial improvements in Sun's support system.andP;  We could reasonably expectno better service than what we received.andM;Sun provides a 90-day warranty on new systems.andP;  After that, a contract forservice can be purchased from the company.andP;  For same-day, on-site service,the contract costs are somewhat less than the one percent of system listprice per month that is currently the norm in the computer industry.andP;  Giventhe low parts count on the logic board, however, the maintenance rate stillseems a little high for the system.andP;  Again, however, the monthly charge forservice is proportionately lower than what was charged for service contractson previous Sun systems, and it is a marked improvement over those previousrates.andM;This is the third Sun system we have reviewed for &quot;Tested Mettle&quot;.andP;  We havenever been enthralled with Sun's documentation, and still are not.andP;  Althoughthis set is more usable than previous ones, we still find errors, omissions,and organization problems in the documents.andP;  One especially notable problemfor us occurred during installation.andP;  A screen image in the documentation,showing what to type for installation, clearly did not indicate a mandatorycharacter space between two command line items.andP;  The installation failswithout the space.andP;  The missing space was clearly a simplee typesettingerror, but it caused us extra work.andP;  Generally, problems with Sun'sdocumentation are now only annoying, and not crucial.andM;Three of the Sparcstation 1 documents come in spiral-bound 8 x 9-inch books.andO;We find these spiral-bound books much easier to use than the traditional8-1/2 x 11 loose-leaf manuals.andM;Operation and Ease of UseandM;By default, the Sun operating system boots to a scrolling screen display.andO;SunView, a bundled-in windowing system, can easily be made the default userinterface, as can Sun's News, an optional windowing package.andP;  These are bothuseful and easy to use, although we would greatly prefer a standard X11interface because of its nearly universal availability.andM;Sun has done a very good job of maintaining compatibility across its threeCPU families of systems (680x0, 80386, and Sparc).andP;  All our test code ranwithout modification when ported to the Sparcstation 1, as it did earlierwhen we moved it to the 80386 platform and previous Sparc-based systems.andO;This code included graphics benchmarks for both the CGI and CORE libraries,even though those tests were compiled and run on very different graphicshardware than were previous graphics benchmarks using these libraries.andM;Sun has announced that both the CGI and CORE libraries, which havetraditionally been included in SunOS, are being phased out in favor of GKSand PHIGS graphics libraries.andP;  Our only objection to this change is that bothGKS and PHIGS are optional -- and relatively expensive -- software packagesthat will not be included as part of SunOS.andP;  This suggests that less value isbeing provided in SunOS itself, since the CORE and CGI graphics librarieswill no longer be supported.andP;  However, we expect the X11 package to beinexpensive enough to make the lack of a standard OS-supported library aminor issue.andM;Sun systems come standard with many Ethernet packages, including ftp, telnet,and NFS.andP;  All of the software included in the Sun operating system seems towork well, and we found no bugs.andP;  SunOS has always been our standard for whata UNIX system needs in order to provide &quot;typical&quot; system administration.andO;Administration of a Sparcstation 1 is just like that found on any other Sunsystem using SunOS 4.0.andP;  The details have changed slightly from 3.x versionsof SunOS, but the functionality is even better.andP;  Network administration isparticularly well implemented on Sun systems, and 4.0 is no exception.andM;Interestingly, in order for it to become the standard it is today, Sun'sNetwork File System has been provided to most of Sun's competitors.andP;  Thisfact, combined with the availability of network administration software fromother hardware vendors, means that Sun is not all that different from mostother hardware manufacturers in what it is able to offer and how its networksare administered.andM;PerformanceandM;The only noticeable slow aspect of Sparcstation 1 performance is,unfortunately, one of the first things a user encounters: the machine justdoes not paint characters on the screen as fast as most of its competition.andO;In the scrolling display mode, the system is pretty slow in generatingcharacters, in fact.andP;  When in a windowing environment such as Sunview, therate is still slow, but acceptable.andP;  This is not a new problem for Sun, andthe Sparcstation 1 has display rates that are competitive with othersuccessful Sun products in the past.andP;  The character display rate isnonetheless slow.andM;Figure 1 shows the Dhrystone, Whetstone, and Linpack (MFLOPS) performanceratings for the Sparcstation 1 and six other competitive systemconfigurations.andP;  The Sparcstation 1 has a lower Dhrystone rating than eitherthe Mips RS2030 or the DECstation 3100 by a sizable margin.andP;  Results for theCompaw 386 systems were obtained under ISC UNIX and Greenhills compilers.andO;The Dhrystone test is often used to indicate a system's overall MIPS rating,and the relative values shown in Figure 1 are approximately correct for thisanalysis.andP;  However, both the Mips and DEC systems get an extra boost onDhrystones that is not a function of the processing speed of the hardware,but is attributable instead to their compilers.andM;The Whetstone and Linpack values in Figure 1 reflect the results offloating-point tests for the system.andP;  Again, the Sparcstation 1 is not asfast as the Mips or DEC workstations on these four tests.andP;  The Sparcstation 1is about as fast as the Silicon Graphics Personal Iris or the Compaq 386/33on both single- and double-precision Whetstone, but is faster than either ofthem on the Linpack test.andP;  The Weitek floating-point chip used in theSparcstation 1 does not support trigonometric math functions as well as otherFPU chips do, and we believe the test results shown in Figure 1 indicatethis.andP;  Whetstone, which makes some use of these same math functions, does notrun as well (relatively) on a Sparcstation 1 as the Linpack benchmark does,which makes no use of the math libraries.andM;The Compaq systems are shown in Figure 1 to indicate how close powerful PCshave come to matching the performance of RISC workstations.andP;  The 80386/Weitekcombination, at 33 MHz, is an impressive piece of work, and the performancewith an 80387 FPU chip is not bad.andP;  This level of system performance,combined with ISC UNIX, X11, TCP/IPM and NFS software, provides a realworkstation environment at RISC-workstation performance levels in aCISC-based box.andP;  It also suggests that the next generation of RISCworkstations will be challenged by the forthcoming 80486 and 68040processors, which are expected to be two to three times faster than current80386 and 68030 chips.andM;Figure 2 shows the disk transfer rate, in kilobytes per second, we obtainwhen the systems tested are sequentially reading 2 MB of data from an 8 MBfile.andP;  The block size for this test varies from 512 to 8192 bytes.andP;  Of thesystems shown, the Sparcstation 1 is consistently either the fastest orsecond fastest.andP;  Both the Sparcstation 1 workstation and Compaq PC systemsare substantially faster than the other systems listed.andM;The Compaq 386/33 (which uses a 33 MHz 80386 chip) does well on this test,thanks partially to the hardware.andP;  On the 386/33, the disk drive is a 300 MB15 MHz ESDI drive.andP;  Previous ESDI drives have transferred data at 10 MHz, andthe Compaq system gets a real boost from the new disk drive's performance.andO;The Mips, Silicon Graphics, DEC, and Sun workstations all use similar SCSIdisk drives, so Sun's outstanding performance, while a function of manyissues, is in large part attributable to the way SunOS handles memory anddisk buffers.andP;  The data rates shown Figure 2 for both the Sun and the Compaqsystems are among the best we have seen to date, and all of the systems inFigure 2 have acceptable data transfer rates.andM;Figure 3 shows the results of another disk transfer test, with rates inkilobytes per second.andP;  The data file being accessed is located on a remotesystem.andP;  For this test our data directory, holding all of the data files, wasmounted on a Mips M/ 120-5 server.andP;  The Mips system, which is equipped withtwo disk drives and 16 MB of memory, was chosen because it is the fastestserver currently available to us for testing.andM;Because it has 16 MB of RAM and the files we were working with were 8 MBfiles, the Mips server was doing substantial file buffering.andP;  Buffering leadsto higher transfer rates than would otherwise be seen, but they arereasonable for a network with a server larger than the systems it works with.andO;These tests were also run on a network on which there was no concurrentactivity, so the entire Ethernet bandwidth was available for thedata-requesting system.andP;  Thus, the values achieved here are &quot;best-case&quot;network data transfers.andM;It is clear that the Sparcstation 1 is the fastest system on this test,although the Mips RS2030 and DEC DECstation 3100 systems are not far behind.andO;We notice several interesting points in this data.andP;  First, the Mips RS2030and DECstation 3100 achieve data rates across the network as good as orbetter than they do on the local disk drive.andP;  We suspect this is because thelocal disk drive is not performing as well as it could for both systems.andP;  Ofthe other systems, the Compaq suffers the biggest percentage degradation inthe comparison of network to local-disk performance, with a penalty ofapproximately 50 percent.andP;  The Silicon Graphics system, on the other hand,seems to have only a 10- to 15-percent penalty across the network.andM;To our surprise, all the systems shown in Figure 3 achieve good data rates onthe network-read test.andP;  In fact, all the transfer rates shown aresubstantially higher across the network than the rates most workstations wereable to achieve with local disk drives as late as 1986.andM;Figure 4 shows test results we obtain when the systems tested are randomlyreading 2 MB of data from an 8 MB file.andP;  Again, we list results for fourdifferent block sizes, ranging from 512 bytes to 8192 bytes.andP;  This particulartest is sensitive to the amount of memory in a system as well as to theperformance of the disk drive itself.andP;  All of the systems in figure 4 werefitted with 8 MB of RAM (except the Compaq 386/25, with 6 MB), so memory sizeis not a significant issue here.andP;  Clearly, the Sun machine is the fastest ofthe systems on this test.andP;  This is predominantly a function of the way SunOShandles files on a disk as well as the way it handles memory.andP;  Again, the Sunnumbers are among the best we have seen on this benchmark test.andP;  There is a20-to-1 difference between the best and worst ratings for the small blocksize on this test, and a 3-to-1 difference on the largest block size.andP;  Giventhe relative sameness of these systems, other manufacturers should look atSun's means of achieving such good disk performance and attempt to replicateit.andM;Figure 5 shows results we obtain when the systems listed are randomly reading2 MB of data from an 8 MB file located across the network.andP;  As it was for thetests reported in Figure 3, the data directory was mounted using NFS on aMips M/ 120-5 system, and Ethernet was loaded only with the transfer requestsfrom the system under evaluation.andM;Surprisingly, there are several combinations of block sizes and systems whichdo better across the network than on the locak disk.andP;  We believe this is afunction of the larger memory available on the server and of the doublebuffering that occurs.andP;  This effect may not show up on a heavily loadednetwork where memory is always very scarce on the server--it really dependson the applications being run across the network.andM;Usually, &quot;Tested Mettle&quot; looks at the graphics performance of theworkstations tested.andP;  Because X11 was not yet available on the Sparcstation 1when we did our tests, we find ourselves obliged to publish performanceresults in a future column, after we have a version of Sun's merged X11 andNews product.andP;  The GX graphics option can give very high performance, Sunclaims, and we are anxious to see how the board works with the X11 graphicslibrary.andP;  Our tests under both CORE and CGI show the Sparcstation 1 issubstantially faster than previous Sun systems using earlier-model graphicscards.andP;  However, since neither of these graphics libraries will be supportedin the future, and since their performance does not seem to reflect thecapabilities of the graphics accelerator, it would not be reasonable toattempt to compare other systems' graphics performance with the Sparcstation1's at this time.andM;Figure 6 shows Workstation Laboratories' Khornerstone benchmark ratings forthe systems listed.andP;  The Khornerstone test yields a normalized numericalrating of performance based on a mix of floating-point, processor, anddisk-intensive tests (21 in all), as well as another value representing thetotal time it takes to execute all of the tests.andP;  As is shown, theSparcstation 1 takes third place (out of seven systems tested) inKhornerstone values--which is about where it placed on the performance testsshown in Figure 1.andM;The Khornerstone rating is achieved by adding up contributions from a givensystem's disk, FPU, CPU, and total-time performance.andP;  Evaluating each ofthese components points to some notable results.andP;  The Sparcstation 1 isclearly faster than the DECstation 3100 or Mips RS2030 on disk-intensivetests, but it is slower on CPU and FPU tests.andP;  In comparison to othermanufacturers, however, Sun has done a better job of keeping its systemsbalanced.andP;  While Sun has increased the performance of its newer systems onall parts of the Khornerstone test by roughly the same percentage compared tofigures we obtained in testing its typical 1986-model workstations, DEC andMips have not managed to improve the disk performance of their offerings (theDECstation 3100 and Mips RS2030) by nearly as much, on a percentage basis, asthey have their performance on the CPU and FPU portions of our test.andM;Thus, although our Khornerstone benchmark rates the Sparcstation 1 as slowerthan the DECstation 3100 or the Mips RS2030, this is an accurate predictionof true overall system performance only if the application a given user willbe running is CPU- or FPU-intensive.andP;  Disk-intensive applications are likelyto run faster on the Sparcstation 1, and for applications that are a mix ofCPU and disk-intensive tasks (database systems, for example) it would bedifficult to predict which system will run faster without knowing more aboutthe application itself.andM;Price/PerformanceandM;Our price/performance measure is determined by dividing the list price of asystem by its Khornerstone rating.andP;  Figure 7 shows the results of thiscalculation for the systems listed.andP;  There is not much of a price/performancerange for the four workstations evaluated, and the three PC products do notearn as good a price/performance value.andP;  The best of the systems in Figure 7,the DECstation 3100, was evaluated using a monochrome display; itsprice/performance value would be a little worse if it, like thee other threeworkstations, had been equipped with a color display.andM;Any price/performance numbers under $2.00 per Khornerstone is excellent intoday's computer market.andP;  Those for the PCs--in the $2.00 to $3.00 range--aregood ratings overall.andM;The Sparcstation 1 does well in the price/performance test because, althoughits performance is a little lower than two other systems, it is also lessexpensive to purchase than those other systems.andP;  The Compaq 386/33, bycontrast, is a little slower in performance than the workstations, but it isalso the most expensive of the systems shown in Figure 7 when equivalentlyconfigured.andM;As always, our caveats concerning these price/performance scores include thefact that they do not take into account graphics capabilities (or theirabsence), or performance in a networked or multiuser environment.andP;  The ratingis based entirely upon, and is therefore only as valid as, the Khornerstonetest itself.andP;  We rate the Sparcstation 1 an excellent value overall, andperhaps among the best for appropriate disk-intensive applications.andM;Report CardandM;The report card for the Sun-4/60 a.k.a.andP;  Sparcstation 1 is quite positive.andO;Installation, at least for systems with software preinstalled, rates an&quot;outstanding&quot;.andP;  Documentation--and we admit to a long-standing bias in notliking Sun's documentation--gets an &quot;average&quot;; Sun has improved itsdocumentation substantially over the last 18 months.andP;  Among other things thatSun has improved, the level of support it makes available is significantlybetter than it was a couple of years ago.andM;The system also rates a &quot;good&quot; for expandability.andP;  External SCSI ports, spacefor three internal peripherals, 16 SIMM sockets, and three S-bus slotsprovide substantial capacity for growth.andP;  Assuming the 4 MB SIMM modulesbecome available for this system, thus allowing for 64 MB of RAM in the box,it will clearly have enough expansion capability for nearly all currentapplications.andM;Operation, operating system, and ease to use all rate &quot;good&quot;.andP;  The system issolid, fairly bug-free, and about as standard as any UNIX environment can be.andO;It lacks only a manufacturer-supported X11 package, expected imminently, topossess a full set of the software standards we expect on workstations today.andM;Performance rates an &quot;outstanding&quot;.andP;  While the Sparcstation 1 is not quite asfast as some of the workstations today, in no area is its performancedeficient, and in several areas it provides performance levels as high as anywe have measured on comparable products.andP;  Given these performance levels, andsince this system is truly moderately priced in comparison to itscompetitors, the price/performance ratio of the Sun-4/60 Sparcstation 1 alsorates an &quot;outstanding&quot;.andM;These values combine to earn Sun's new Sparcstation an overall rating of&quot;outstanding&quot;.andP;  It is clearly a machine that merits evaluation by any userlooking for a high-performance workstation in the moderate price range.andP;  Itcan be criticized in few areas, and deserves praise for a number of areasthat are particularly well engineered.andP;  When the placement of just one key onthe keyboard is the most significant problem we can identify, it is obviousthat the system has few major flaws.andM;Barring the unforeseen, Sun has a winner in the Sparcstation 1.andP;  Like allmanufacturers, it will have to increase the performance of systems in thisprice range substantially every 18 months or so to keep up with thecompetition, but this introductory member of the new Sparcstation family iscertainly a good starting point for users who need substantial systems now aswell as a reliable growth path for the future.andM;David Wilson is president of Workstation Laboratories.andP;
