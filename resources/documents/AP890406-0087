ProsperAvril guarded the National Palace today with anti-aircraft guns andcannons after he declared a state of emergency to counter theweek's second military rebellion.   The order Wednesday by the embattled president, in power forjust six months, also included a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Early today,he went on state-run television to appeal to the mutineers to endtheir uprising.   Government forces also stood guard outside the national bank andthe telecommunications office, which were briefly occupied by therebels Wednesday.   Sporadic machine-gun fire and what sounded like explodinggrenades could be heard during the night. Radio Soleil, the RomanCatholic station, reported today that one man was shot to death andthree other people were wounded overnight, but the circumstanceswere unclear.   Several hundred youths marched into downtown Port-au-Prince atmidmorning and erected barricades of tires and boxes which they seton fire. Soldiers fired into the air to disperse the crowd.   About 25 rebel soldiers and 200 supporters stood outside amilitary barracks 200 yards away from the palace, which was guardedby loyal soldiers.   Most stores were closed, and few buses or cars moved through thecapital.   Avril appeared on television at 2 a.m., speaking calmly forabout 10 minutes from his office in the National Palace. He wassurrounded by soldiers.   ``I exhort you brothers in arms, soldiers of our splendid army,to leave the vile path of treason and national shame and find onceagain the shining path of honor and dignity,'' he said.   Wednesday's uprising was the second in the 7,000-man army sinceSunday, when an attempt to overthrow Avril's government was foiledby loyal soldiers who rescued him as he was being driven to theairport to be deported.   Avril denounced the rebels who held his 14-year-old son and88-year-old mother hostage during Sunday's coup attempt. Thesoldiers also briefly held hostage two of Avril's brothers. Allwere released unharmed.   In imposing a curfew Wednesday, the government blamed Sunday'scoup attempt on a ``vast campaign against drug trafficking,contraband and corruption'' that ``collided with the interests'' ofthose who oppose democratic change.   Avril has recently discharged or transferred several officers ina crackdown on corruption and drug trafficking.   The United States has made the crackdown a condition for theresumption of $70 million in annual aid that it suspended afterthugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's firstfree elections in more than 30 years.   On Wednesday, a rebellion broke out in the Dessalines Barracks,which adjoins the presidential palace. It was unknown how many ofthe 700 Dessalines were taking part.   About 25 Dessaline soldiers and 200 supporters stood todayoutside the barracks, demanding Avril hand over power to thepresident of the Supreme Court of Appeals, Gilbert Austin, a formerjustice minister.   ``There is no compromise possible with Gen. Avril,'' said onesoldier on condition of anonymity. ``We will camp here until heleaves.''   But it did not seem Avril, who appears to have the support ofthe 1,000 presidential guardsmen, would relinquish powervoluntarily.   ``It's a standoff. I think they're just staring each otherdown,'' one Western diplomat said.   Avril's Presidential Guard stationed two anti-aircraft guns,four armored personnel carriers and three-wheeled cannons insidethe National Palace compound.   Radio stations ignored a government order for newspapers, radioand television not to diseminate information except with themilitary's permission. The censorship order came after theDessalines soldiers went on the independent radio Metropole todemand Avril resign. They blame him for the deaths of four rebelsoldiers who held the airport Sunday and Monday.   Those four were members of the elite 400-member Leopard commandounit that had about 100 of its soldiers holding the airport becausetheir commander was being held under military guard, accused ofbeing the ringleader of Sunday's attempt to overthrow Avril.   Avril deported the three alleged coup leaders. In Miami, U.S.immigration officials said the three officers arrived Wednesday andapplied for asylum.   A statement by Army General Headquarters, read on statetelevision, ordered all soldiers to report to their command posts.   Avril, 50, came to power in a Sept. 17 coup led bynoncommissioned officers who said they overthrow Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy because they wanted to end state-sponsored violence andcorruption.   Namphy took over in 1986 when longtime dictator Jean-ClaudeDuvalier fled to exile in France.</TEXT></DOC>
