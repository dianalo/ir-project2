Pieter Kooijmans, U.N. special investigator on human rights, saidSoviet acceptance of the court's authority in six major human rightstreaties ``is the shattering of a 40-year-old taboo.''   Interviewed in Leiden, the Netherlands, Kooijmans added: ``Itwould be a real breakthrough for human rights if the Soviet Unionwould recognize the right of individuals'' to file complaints ofrights abuses.   The World Court does not hear complaints from individuals, onlygovernments.   A State Department legal expert noted that the World Court hasnever handled a human rights dispute and said privately that theSoviet acceptance of jurisdiction ``may amount to nothing more thana meaningless gesture.   ``It would be unlikely that a human rights dispute would everwind its way to the World Court,'' he said.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Thursday that theUnited States welcomes ``any step in the submission of disputes ofthis kind to binding decisions by neutral bodies such as theInternational Court of Justice,'' the court's formal name.   The Soviet Union had ratified the six treaties and pledged tohonor them but withheld recognition of the authority of the WorldCourt to judge its compliance.   On Wednesday, Moscow announced it would accept the court'sjurisdiction in the human rights treaties, putting into practice apolicy President Mikhail S. Gorbachev advocated in December beforethe General Assembly.   The Soviets agreed to the court's authority on treatiescondemning genocide, banning slavery, guaranteeing political rightsfor women, prohibiting racism and outlawing torture.   Gorbachev also has spoken recently in favor of a larger U.N. rolein such international areas as arms control and space exploration,traditionally the domain of the Soviet Union and United States.   The Soviet acceptance of the court's authority will aid theSoviet campaign to hold a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991as one of several follow-up meetings to the 1975 Helsinki agreementson European security and cooperation.   In January, Washington changed its position and said it wouldaccept a Moscow conference, citing the Soviet release of politicalprisoners, the easing of emigration and more tolerant views on freespeech and freedom of religion.   Only governments can take cases before the court, which has 15judges and sits in The Hague in the Netherlands. It has no authorityto deal with complaints of individuals or private organizations.   Under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights, individual citizens can complain ofrights abuses to an international body of legal experts with thepower to order compensation. Hungary ratified the protocol last year.   The United States has ratified only one of the six human rightstreaties. The Soviets have accepted all six.   Last year, the Senate finally ratified the 1948 Convention on thePrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, but it rejectedWorld Court authority over its interpretation. The United States hassigned the five other treaties but the Senate has not ratified them.   ``We have accepted (World Court) jurisdiction over many moretreaties than the Soviet Union has, bilateral and multilateral,''the State Department legal expert said.   The United States rejects World Court's jurisdiction in nationalsecurity cases. In 1986, Nicaragua asked the court to rule on themining of its harbors and covert U.S. support for Contra rebels. Thecourt ruled in Nicaragua's favor but the United States, which didnot participate in the case, refused to accept the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
