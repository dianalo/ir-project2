Karene Witcher (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><IN> BVG TNM </IN><DATELINE> SYDNEY, Australia  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond ended weeks of speculation by proposing to merge his empire with the former flagship of international corporate raider Robert Holmes a Court.    Mr. Bond's Bond Corp. Holdings bought 19.9% of Bell Group Ltd. from Mr. Holmes a Court, a fellow Australian and longtime business rival, in April. Now, as part of a settlement with Australian corporate regulators who questioned that purchase, Bond Corp. is bidding for the rest of Bell Group, except for a 19.9% stake held by the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia. Bond Corp. says its Bell Group offer will cost 520 million Australian dollars (US$414 million) and isn't conditioned on the outcome of the merger plan, which was proposed Friday.    If completed, Mr. Bond's planned merger would put him in control of a multibillion dollar company with the potential of making him an even bigger player on the international corporate stage, particularly in brewing.    &quot;What it boils down to is Bond Corp. becoming a much stronger company,&quot; says Greg Matthews, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in Sydney. The planned merger would reduce substantially Bond Corp.'s hefty ratio of debt to equity. That means the company &quot;can go borrow a whole stack of money and go buy something,&quot; Mr. Matthews says.    But he and others warn the plan faces many potential obstacles and might have to be redrafted. Shareholders of all companies involved in the proposed merger -- some of whom already are unhappy with Mr. Bond's role -- must approve the terms. Then it must pass muster with Australia's corporate regulators, who are keeping a close eye on Mr. Bond's activities.    Some estimates say the marriage of the Bond and Holmes a Court empires will create a vehicle controlling more than A$11 billion (US$8.76 billion) in total assets and A$5 billion in shareholders' funds, making it the second-largest company in Australia after Broken Hill Proprietary Co. BHP, a steel, mining and oil company, controls about A$17.5 billion in assets world-wide and has more than A$7 billion in shareholders' funds.    Bond Corp. currently has total assets of about A$7 billion, mainly in brewing, coal, property, and media and shareholders' funds estimated at A$2 billion.    (Some analysts caution, however, that comparisons between companies, particularly on shareholders' funds, can be misleading because debt instruments, such as convertible bonds, can be counted as either debt or equity.)    Peter Mitchell, a Bond Corp. director, said in an interview that &quot;the essential objective is to create a number of well-defined entities that are specifically oriented toward specific businesses.&quot; The proposed merger, he said, would create a vehicle &quot;poised to expand in terms of raising equity and borrowings.&quot;    To that end, Bond Corp. proposes to create four publicly listed companies that will contain brewing, media, natural resources and property interests.    Following is the strategy contained in a takeover document to be sent to Bell Group shareholders and announced during trading hours Friday:   --Bell Resources Ltd., a 43%-owned unit of Bell Group, would make a takeover offer for Bond Corp. valuing Bond Corp. at about A$1.2 billion, or A$2.80 a share, compared with Friday's close in Sydney of A$2.28 a share, up 18 Australian cents.    --Bell Group would offer one of its shares for every two shares of Bond Media Ltd., a listed company with television, radio and satellite communications interests that is 51%-owned by Bond Corp. Some other Bell Group interests would be sold to eliminate its estimated A$2 billion debt.    --Bell Group would retain 31% of publicly traded British insurer Dewey Warren Holdings PLC. Bond Corp. would keep the company listed, perhaps focusing it on financial services or selling Bond Corp.'s substantial property interests to Dewey Warren, which owns 5% of British investment bank Morgan Grenfell Group PLC.    --Bond Corp. says Bell Group's 37% stake in J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd., an Australian investment company whose main asset is about A$200 million in cash, will be retained.    A potential stumbling block to the merger proposal was removed Friday when New Zealand corporate raider Sir Ronald Brierley and Australian publisher Kerry Packer dropped their joint takeover bids for Bell Resources and J.N. Taylor.    After the planned merger, Bell Resources would hold the company's brewing interests, selling unspecified assets unrelated to brewing. Bond Corp., the world's fourth-largest brewer, says the merged company would expand its brewing business through acquisitions or starting new operations.    Bell Resources' other interests, including coal mines, may go to one of the four listed companies that would hold all the resources interests. Bond Corp. also plans to sell some assets, which it didn't identify, that don't fit with the new company. </TEXT></DOC>
