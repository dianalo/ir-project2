The company, Applied Energy Services, said Tuesday it will give$2 million to an international effort to plant 52 million trees on385 square miles in Guatemala.   The trees should absorb enough carbon dioxide to offset the 1.4million tons that the company's 180-megawatt coal-fired plant inUncasville, Conn., will generate each year during its 40-year life,according to the company's calculations.   The Arlington, Va.-based company said that as an environmentalrule of thumb, two square miles of forest are needed for everymegawatt of coal-fired plant capacity.   Environmentalists hailed the company's move, saying it helpedillustrate the international nature of the greenhouse effect, awarming of the Earth that scientists say appears to have begun dueto increasing carbon dioxide and other chemicals released into theair. Carbon dioxide is formed by fossil fuel combust ion.   The warming could mean an average temperature increase of 3 to 8degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, an increasein sea levels of a foot or more and widespread weather changes thatcould mean more frequent droughts in the center of North America,scientists say.   Worldwide, some 20 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year arereleased into the atmosphere.   Gus Speth, president of the World Resources Institute thathelped organize the Guatemala project, called the Applied Energyaction ``one of the most far-sighted and socially responsibledecisions that any company has ever made.''   Requiring plant operators to offset their emissions in somesimilar manner ``might be proposed someday'' in legislation, hesaid.   Michael Oppenheimer, atmospheric physicist with theEnvironmental Defense Fund in New York, said a colleague, DanDudek, had recently proposed payments from utilities to plant treeson land taken out of agricultural production in the United States.   Other environmentalists were quick to praise the Applied Energydecision.   ``I like it,'' said Neil Simpson, executive vice president ofthe American Forestry Association, which is planning atree-planting campaign of its own. ``It recognizes we're in oneworld, when you've got a Connecticut company going to Guatemala toplant trees.''   Roger Sant, chief executive officer of Applied Energy, said hehoped the project would prove ``a useful mitigation strategy'' forall new coal-fired electric generation capacity.   ``We don't yet know that this is going to work perfectly,'' butif it does ``we're looking to follow the same strategy at our otherplants,'' Sant said.   Applied Energy is one of the new independent producers sellingpower under contract to utilities, escaping tight state regulationfor generally looser federal supervision. The company operatesthree plants totaling 360 megawatts and has contracts to build1,600 megawatts of generating capacity.   When the Uncasville plant is completed, it will sell power toConnecticut Light andamp; Power Co.   Applied Energy's cash for the Guatemala project will be matchedby cash or services totaling $2 million from CARE, $1.2 millionfrom the government of Guatemala, $3.6 million from the Agency forInternational Development and $7.5 million from the Peace Corps.CARE, an international development organization based in New York,will handle the company's contribution.</TEXT></DOC>
