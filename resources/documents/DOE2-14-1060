One mode behaviour is observed forthe low frequency phonons and the A/sub 1g/ mode, while a two mode behaviouris exhibited by the higher frequency vibrations. The expected mass, force,and temperature induced splitting of the B/sub 1g//sup 2/ and E/sub g//sup1/ degenerated modes is not observed. This fact proposes another differentexperimental evidence of the low Raman cross section of the B/sub 1g//sup2/ rigid layer mode. For the first time the degeneracy of the E/sub g//sup2/ mode with the A/sub 1g/ is lifted and experimentally found.</TEXT></DOC>
