In the past, most of the fault diagnosisfor machinery or equipment was performed by expert who had much experiencein operations, some test equipment, and troubleshooting manual writtenbefore the machinery or plant was shipped. KIS (Kawasaki Inference System)has been developed as a generalized expert system tool. Using KIS, anengineer can easily develop an efficient system, and can easily accessinformation and interact with the system. This paper describes the fundamentalprinciples of KIS fault diagnosis. KIS is to be used for actual faultdiagnosis in the field, including a gas turbine plant. 7 references,14 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
