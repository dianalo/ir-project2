The companies said United Telecom will take immediate management control.    Kansas City, Mo.-based United Telecom's first move was to replace US Sprint's current president, Robert H. Snedaker, with William T. Esrey, the president and chief executive officer of United Telecom who engineered the transaction with Stamford, Conn.-based GTE. Mr. Snedaker, who will take early retirement effective Aug. 15, had deposed US Sprint's former president, Charles Skibo, only a year ago.    The companies said they expect GTE's directors to review a definitive agreement for the sale in the next several days. Under negotiated terms, United Telecom will pay GTE book value at Dec. 31, 1988, for an additional 30.1% interest in US Sprint, raising United's stake in the venture to 80.1% and reducing GTE's stake to 19.9%.    Although United Telecom gets immediate management control, GTE will continue to pick up 50% of US Sprint's losses for the remainder of this year. The transaction is scheduled to close Jan. 3. GTE would then become a limited partner. United Telecom also will have the option until Dec. 31, 1995, to buy GTE's remaining interest in the venture at book value as of Dec. 31, 1988, or as of the time the option is exercised, whichever is higher.    Analysts interpreted the move as a bailout by risk-adverse GTE and a brilliant move by United Telecom, whose Mr. Esrey has persuaded GTE to sell control just when US Sprint may finally start making money. Mr. Esrey, who is assuming the leadership of US Sprint on an interim basis, had predicted in 1986 that US Sprint would make money in 1987, but it failed to do so. Analysts expect the venture to emerge from the red by next year.    James L. &quot;Rocky&quot; Johnson, GTE's new chairman and chief executive, said that the 50-50 partnership arrangement was appropriate when the partners were jointly spending over $1 billion annually to build US Sprint's fiber optic network. But now that the network is nearly complete, the arrrangement has become burdensome, slowing decision-making in a fast changing industry, Mr. Johnson said.    Mr. Johnson said he didn't view the decision to sell as a bailout, but rather an &quot;effort to make Sprint as profitable as it can be quickly as possible. The best way for us to do that is have one partner in control of that business.&quot; As United Telecom, a much smaller company than GTE, is most enthusiastic about US Sprint's prospects and is most affected by its results, Mr. Johnson said it made sense for that company to take control.    The transaction also allows GTE &quot;to refocus on the rest of our core business,&quot; of local phone operations, cellular phones, computer network services, lighting and precision materials, Mr. Johnson said. &quot;The funds we get from United will immediately increase our earnings as well as decrease our losses&quot; from US Sprint. Last year, GTE recorded $577 million in pretax losses from its 50% share of US Sprint.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, GTE's shares closed at $40, down 37.5 cents. United Telecom shares were unchanged at $33.625.    After accounting for a 1985 write-off, investment tax credits and tax credits from US Sprint losses, GTE said it has had losses of $1.5 billion in its five-year foray into the long-distance business, which began when it bought Sprint from Southern Pacific Co. Since GTE and United formed their venture in July 1986, they have contributed $4.2 billion to it. US Sprint in turn has generated $1.4 billion in pretax operating losses plus $350 million in special writedowns, according to United.    The transaction also reflects different views of competing with telephone giant American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which continues to dominate the long-distance phone market. Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said United Telecom sees far more eventual profit potential in US Sprint than does GTE. Executives close to the situation said United took advantage of a change in GTE top management; Mr. Johnson is said to be less enthusiastic about US Sprint than his predecessor, Theodore Brophy, who retired this past spring.    Mr. Esrey said United Telecom is &quot;extremely pleased&quot; to be taking control of US Sprint. United will use proceeds from selling its cellular business to pay GTE and the transaction won't change United's improved debt-to-equity ratio, he said.    However, on news of the increased stake in US Sprint, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. placed United Telecom and its units' securities on the CreditWatch list with negative implications. United Telecom's consolidated long-term debt totals about $3.1 billion.    The ratings concern said United would be exposed to a greater share of Sprint's losses and future capital funding requirements. &quot;The purchase could effectively absorb all the cash United is expected to get from the sale of cellular interests to Centel Corp., precluding any near-term reduction in United's debt,&quot; Sandamp;P said.    But GTE Corp. and GTE Finance Corp.'s senior debt, rated single-A-minus, and A-1 commercial paper and GTE Corp.'s single-A-minus preferred stock were placed on CreditWatch with positive implications. GTE had $10.4 billion of consolidated debt on March 31, Sandamp;P said. The sale of the US Sprint stake &quot;would improve GTE's business risk profile,&quot; Sandamp;P said. </TEXT></DOC>
