Brett.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The new Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard forlocal-area networks is a response to user demands for greaterspeed and reliability than that provided by the current Ethernetand Token Ring standards.andP;  FDDI's Link Layer Control and MediaAccess Control (MAC) documents correspond to the data-link layerof the OSI model, while the Physical and Physical Medium Dependentsublayers correspond to OSI's physical layer.andP;  Token Ring andEthernet use data-encoding schemes which take 2 baud to representa single bit, while FDDI uses 5 baud to represent 4 bits.andP;  Adistributed clocking scheme increases speed.andP;  MAC is similar toits Token Ring counterpart, but manipulates data as 4-bit symbolsand captures tokens before converting them into frames.andP;  FDDI isnot yet a complete standard, but is well on the way to approvaland will probably appear first in large corporate and campusnetworks.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Local area networks (Computer networks)Fiber opticsStandardizationFiber Distributed Data Interface StandardNetwork ManagementNetwork ArchitectureOptical CommunicationsTransmission Speed.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   How the Fiber Distributed Data Interface standard stacks up(table)The four key documents of the Fiber Distributed Data Interface(table)The secondary ring in a FIber Distributed Data Interface system(table)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
