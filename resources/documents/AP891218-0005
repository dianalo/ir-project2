REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Corazon Aquino'srelationship with the press is a love affair gone sour.   Once she praised the media for helping her take power. Now, shethreatens legal action against those news outlets deemed to beaiding the forces bent on toppling her.   Seeking to repair the damage wrought by the recent failed coup,Mrs. Aquino on Monday told reporters that the government wouldrevoke the franchise of broadcasters who violate regulationsagainst airing ``subversive propaganda.''   ``With regard to print media, it's an entirely differentmatter,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``We will base this on any article thatwill incite to rebellion. If such an article does appear in any ofthe newspapers, then we will go to court to file charges againstthe erring individual or the publication.''   She gave no indication what standards would be used indetermining whether reports ``incite rebellion.''   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition he not be named,defended government plans in the wake of the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt,the most serious of six in her nearly 4 years in power. He saidthere had been examples in American history when presidents imposedcontrols during grave national emergencies.   But media controls of any sort are a sensitive issue in acountry emerging from years of strongman rule under the latePresident Ferdinand Marco, a country uncertain of the strength ofits democratic institutions.   ``The government assault on press freedom has begun,'' said thenewspaper Malaya. ``What is frightening is the mere thought thatthe Aquino government, swept into power on the promise of rigidobservance of the citizens' rights and liberties, would entertainthe idea of muzzling the press.''   Since Marcos was ousted, more than 20 English, Tagalog andChinese-language newspapers have appeared in the capital, and theManila press has become one of the most free-wheeling in Asia.   The government's move clearly aims to limit access to media,particularly radio, for rebels still at large. Ironically, some ofMrs. Aquino's stalwarts complained of stringent measures undertakento limit access to opposition groups under Marcos.   During the February 1986 uprising that toppled Marcos, Mrs.Aquino's allies carefully cultivated foreign reporters and localjournalists bold enough to challenge the government's version ofevents. On the first anniversary of the Marcos ouster, thegovernment awarded certificates of thanks to foreign journalistswho covered the 1986 uprising.   So far, the National Telecommunications Commission has closedjust two radio stations _ a pro-Marcos outlet in Manila and anotherbroadcaster in Cebu. The Cebu station was later allowed to reopen.   After an August 1987 coup attempt, some independent stationsaired taped interviews with renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan, also believed to have been a leader of the recent putsch.   No statements from rebels have been broadcast since they gave uptheir last position Dec. 9.   Newspaper executives say they have received no directivestelling them what to print. But several, speaking on condition ofanonymity, say they fear such a move in the future if the politicalsituation worsens.   On Monday, the Philippine Daily Globe reported that militaryChief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa asked that another newspaper,the Philippine Daily Inquirer, be closed for ``inaccuratereporting'' during the coup attempt but that de Villa was overruledby the administration.   Neither de Villa nor the presidential palace has commented onthe report. In a front-page editorial today, the Inquirer suggestedde Villa ``stick to soldiering and leave newspapering to those whounderstand its mission and operation.''   Even before the coup attempt, Mrs. Aquino's relations with theManila press had deteriorated. Columnists regularly lambasted theadministration for inefficiency, alleged corruption and favoritismof presidential relatives.   Reporters covering the president often complain that access islimited to weekly ``mini-press conferences'' in which Mrs. Aquinoanswers a limited number of questions, often with vague, standardresponses.</TEXT></DOC>
