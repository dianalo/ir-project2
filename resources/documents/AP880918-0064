The governing party, architects of Sweden's welfare state, facedone of its most serious election challenges in 50 years in thefirst national vote since its leader, Olaf Palme, was assassinatedon Feb. 28, 1986.   The big losers appeared to be the three non-socialist parties.   A computer projection carried by Swedish Television, based onreturns from 340 of 360 population centers, indicated that theModerates, Liberals and Center Party would lose 21 of their 171seats in the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament.   The Social Democrats lost only one of their 159 seats and theGreens picked up 20 seats, the television projections showed. Thecomputer projection indicated the Communists, which had 19 seats,picked up two additional seats.   Overall, the Social Democrats were projected to win 43.9 percentof the total, or 158 seats; the Moderates, 17.9 percent, 64 seats;the Liberals, 12 percent, or 43 seats; the Center Party, 11.9percent, or 43 seats; the Communists, 5.7 percent, or 21 seats; theGreens, 5.5 percent, 20 seats; and the Christian Democrats, 3.1percent, no seats.   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the Social Democrats,said the government will hold the same course and offered acritique of the Greens.   ``We will stick to the same policy as before,'' he said in atelevision interview. ``The interesting thing is that theenvironment party entered (parliament) but are not power brokers. ... That is good, maybe even for them.   ``The problem is that we don't know where they stand,'' Carlssonsaid of the Greens. ``We will be able to judge them by their deedsin the Riksdag.''   Greens spokeswoman Eva Goes declined to say whether her partywill lean to the left or right.   ``We'll be dynamic when it comes to ecology. That's what thiselection is about, the issues of the future, the 1990s ... and youcan ask yourself whether that is left or right,'' she said in atelevision interview.   Greens members were jubilant over their victory.   ``Great fun,'' said party spokesman Birger Schlaug. ``This wasan impossible project, to get a new party into Sweden's Riksdag.. .Our existence means parliament will be greener, and that's what'sneeded.''   Political analyst Soren Holmberg called the showing by the threenon-socialists a ``disaster'' and ``their worst result in Swedishhistory.''   The voter turnout was an unusually low 85.8 percent of thoseeligible, television reported.   Also competing for the attention of 6.3 million registeredvoters were about 100 minor parties. They ranged from the SocialistWorkers' Party, which opposes foreign immigration to Sweden, to theDonald Duck Party, a joke party with no platform for voters whomight otherwise turn in blank ballots.   Swedes also choose 284 municipal and 24 county councils and voteon local issues.   A series of scandals have eroded support for the SocialDemocrats in the past two years. Among them was failure of policeto find Palme's killer and reports of official bungling in theinvestigation.   At the same time, opposition to nuclear power and growingenvironmental concerns, especially among young people, drew supportto the Greens and away from the established parties.   Pre-election polling suggested the Communists were in danger ofbeing shut out for the first time since their founding in 1917.   On the eve of the election, Carlsson, got mediocre reviews onhis performance in a televised debate Friday night.   With the exception of 1976-1982, when the country was governedby a center- right coalition, the Social Democrats have been at thehelm of the Swedish welfare state since 1932.   In the election campaign, they stressed their economicsuccesses, such as reducing unemployment from 3 percent to 1.7percent, one of the world's lowest rates. They also stressedstandardized health care, child care and universal education inSweden, where poverty is practically unknown.   The country's taxes are, however, the highest in the world. Anemployee making the equivalent of $50,000 a year can expect to givehalf of it to the government, and the rate can reach up to 80percent for higher incomes.   Consumer prices are boosted by a 23.4 percent value added taxrate and inflation, about 7 percent so far this year, is roughlytwice the European average.   The three non-socialist parties proposed various options for taxreforms. They also urged a loosening of welfare regulations thatwould allow Swedes to choose private health care and schools fortheir children.</TEXT></DOC>
