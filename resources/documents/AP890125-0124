North disclosed today they have issued subpoenas inthe Iran-Contra case to three House committees and two members ofthe House.   North attorney Barry Simon said the subpoenas were sent to theHouse Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees.   The two members of Congress weren't identified. Defense subpoenasalso were issued for two unidentified House staff members.   The House, through the general counsel to the clerk, subsequentlymoved to quash portions of the subpoenas to the committees. A22-page court brief said the panels could not allow the ``wholesalerummaging through the records of the House'' sought by North'slawyers.   North's subpoenas require ``surrender of the broadest imaginablerange of privileged documents,'' including ``the whole set ofrecords'' of the House intelligence panel's investigation of theresupply operation for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the brief said.   The committee began the investigation after the October 1986shootdown of a Contra resupply plane in Nicaragua carrying AmericanEugene Hasenfus as one of its crew members.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said with regard to the twoHouse members subpoenaed: ``We're not going to pull them off thefloor. We're going to have to approach this part of the case withsome degree of accommodation.''   North's trial is scheduled to get under way next Tuesday,although an interagency intelligence group is still reviewingclassified documents that both the prosecution and defense want touse at trial.   The brief references to subpoenas by North's defense team came ata court hearing where prosecutors argued in favor of subpoenaingNorth's spiral notebooks, which he compiled on a daily basis whilehe was at the NSC.   Gesell said he would decide by Friday whether North should becompelled to produce the notebooks, portions of which were turnedover to Congress for the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.   At the court hearing, Simon said the notebooks might be appliedto the portion of the case alleging destruction of documents byNorth in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair was unfolding.   Simon said prosecutors might try to link references in thenotebooks to documents that North allegedly destroyed before leavingthe NSC.   Simon declined to acknowledge that the notebooks existed or werein North's possession, but he said North is entitled to FifthAmendment protection against self-incrimination.   The notebooks also delve into North's assistance to theNicaraguan Contra rebels and his involvement in the Reaganadministration's secret arms shipments to Iran.   North took the last of the notebooks with him when he wasdismissed on Nov. 25, 1986 after the diversion of Iran arms saleproceeds to the Contras was uncovered.   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has been trying to get thenotebooks since well before North's indictment last year.   A subpoena for the material was issued through the federal grandjury investigating the Iran-Contra affair, but was withdrawn afterNorth was charged, Walsh said in a court filing Monday.   Walsh said the notes are ``presidential records over which theUnited States has complete ownership and control.''   The notebooks could be used by prosecutors in an attempt tobolster the portion of the government's case alleging that Northmade false statements to Congress by saying that the NSC offered notactical advice to the Contras and by denying that he used hisinfluence to help move supplies to them.   North's notebooks describe successful efforts to obtain falseend-user certificates from Guatemala stating that arms actuallydestined for the Contras were instead for the exclusive use of theCentral American country to which they were being sent. The falsecertificates enabled one of North's co-defendants, Richard Secord,to ship more than 90,000 pounds of East European munitions bychartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to the Contras.   North's notebooks also touch on his participation in efforts tosecure space at a Salvadoran air base to launch Contra resupplymissions, and the construction of an emergency airstrip in SantaElena, Costa Rica, to help open a southern front of Contra militaryoperations.   The notebooks also detail North's participation in arranging theNovember 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.   One charge against North is that he obstructed Congress byhelping to prepare a false chronology that said no U.S. officiallearned before January 1986 that Hawk missiles had been shipped toIran in November 1985.   In notebook entries for Nov. 20, 1985, several days before theHawk missile shipment, North detailed a plan for shipping Hawks toIran in exchange for a four-phase release of hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
