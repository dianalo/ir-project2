These surveys,which are conducted by State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs), areused to determine the prevailing wages being paid to domestic workers inparticular areas and crop activities. Such prevailing wage informationis used by ETA in reviewing the adequacy of wages being offered by agriculturalemployers who utilize the SESA intra/interstate agricultural clearancejob order system to recruit non-local workers for agricultural jobs. Utilizationof the clearance system is required for employers who apply to ETA forthe purpose of obtaining labor certification for the temporary employmentof aliens in agriculture and logging in the U.S. under the provisions ofthe H-2A and H-2B programs. The current prevailing wage survey proceduresare contained in ET Handbook No. 385, August 1981.In drafting revisions to the existing procedures, ETA has consulted withother DOL agencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and selected SESAtechnical experts. A draft of the revised ET Handbook No. 385 section coveringprevailing wage surveys is currently being circulated officially throughoutDOL for review and comment. The Office of Management and Budget also isinvolved in the review process.Because of the interest in the revision process made known to ETA by non-governmentalindividuals and entities, ETA is publishing for the information of allinterested parties the major component of the draft Handbook currentlybeing circulated for review within DOL.

Purpose of SurveyAn agricultural prevailing wage survey is a survey conducted by State EmploymentSecurity agencies (SESAs) to determine the prevailing wages paid to a groupof workers in a specific agricultural activity performed in a geographicarea predetermined by the SESA. The survey is an important tool in implementingDOL's regulations on the intra/interstate recruitment of agricultural workers(20 CFR 653.501).Major components of this process are the planning of surveys, the actualcollection and compilation of data, and the determination of prevailingwage rates which are acceptable for agricultural clearance job order purposes.B. Who Is Responsible for the Survey and Wage Determinations1. <T3>SESA</T3> is responsible for planning and conducting the surveys; forassuring quality control; and for making preliminary prevailing wage determinations.2. <T3>ETA Regional Office</T3> is responsible for revising and approvingSESA survey plans, and for monitoring entire survey process to assure qualitycontrol and conformance with Handbook procedures.3. <T3>ETA National Office</T3> is responsible for reviewing SESA preliminarywage findings and making official prevailing wage determinations.C. Under What Circumstances and When Should Survey be ConductedState agencies shall make surveys at least once per season in any cropactivity in a wage reporting area in which:1. Fifty (50) or more domestic workers (interstate or intrastate) recruitedby the Employment Service were employed in the previous season, or mayreasonably be expected to be recruited in the current season; or2. Fifty (50) or more H-2A workers were employed in the previous season,or employers have requested or may be expected to request fifty (50) ormore H-2A workers in the current season; or3. The crop or crop activity has been designated by ETA as important becauseof its status in the national economy, large numbers of workers not recruitedthrough the Job Service are employed, or for other reasons.If possible, the survey should be conducted during the active work season.However, a survey may be conducted at any time of the year provided itreflects conditions at the peak of the season for the specific crop activity.Collected data should cover one week at the peak period, except that foran unusual crop situation the data may cover up to two weeks at the peakperiod. (Special provisions for conducting an emergency survey are discussedin <T3>Section II C.</T3>)D. Scope of SurveyThe following factors must be given threshold consideration by SESAs inconducting prevailing wage surveys:andbullet; The wage survey covers ``domestic'' workers only; this means aworker who is legally qualified to work in the U.S., i.e., a worker, otherthan a H-2A worker, for whom the employer has completed an I-9, INS's EmploymentEligibility Verification form. If H-2A employers are included in the survey,information should be collected from them only on the wage rates paid theirdomestic workers.andbullet; A specific crop or task activity is the type of work actuallyperformed in relation to a general crop or task. The specific activitymay include different stages of harvesting such as 1st pick, 2nd pick orstrip. It may also include different use of the product such as pickingfor the fresh market, for processing into juice or for canning. The specificactivity may also be based on varying wage levels or the method of operationsuch as moving 3-inch pipe, 4-inch pipe or wheellines in irrigation work.andbullet; A wage reporting area is the agricultural reporting area as definedfor the purpose of ETA-223 reports (Handbook pages I-102 to I-105) whichwill normally be the geographic entity for wage survey purposes. However,in some instances, subareas of the reporting area may be more appropriatefor wage survey purposes because of substantial dissimilarities in cropor related conditions within the agricultural reporting area.andbullet; The wage survey should include domestic workers of small, mediumand large employers from the entire area being surveyed, and should beselected by probability sampling methods. While most survey informationmay be obtained by telephone or mail contacts, attempts should be madeto include a representative number of personal employer interviews in allwage surveys in order to supplement and verify survey information obtainedby telephone or mail. The State agency must assure itself that informationgathered is representative of the rates being paid in the crop activity.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Specific Survey Planning and Performance</ITAG>A. Standards for Planning Prevailing Wage Surveys1. <T3>Planning surveys. </T3>An assessment of prospective seasonal agriculturalactivity should be made by the State agency <T3>well in advance </T3>of anticipated farm labor needs in those cropsand activities which meet, or are expected to meet, the conditions specifiedin Section I-C. Written plans shall be prepared for scheduled surveys andsent to the Regional Office for approval. (See page I- .)2. <T3>Representativesness of wage rates (sampling)</T3>. Before conductinga survey, the State agency should assure that the planned sample will yielddata which will be representative of the wage rates paid in the crop activityin the area of intended employment. The wage survey sample should includedomestic workers of small, medium and large employers from the entire areabeing surveyed, and should be selected by probability sampling methods.In determining the appropriate universe and in planning sampling procedures,the State should rely upon its established Research and Analysis (R andamp;A) unit. Usually, this unit is already involved in planning and conductingsurveys in other areas, and its expertise in surveying has been refinedover many years.In constructing a sample of workers, the following general guide shouldbe observed:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7</C> <H1>Number of domestic workers in the crop activity in area</H1><H1>Sample size (percent of workers)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">   50-299 <D>55</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  300-499 <D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  500-699 <D>45</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  700-999 <D>40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1000-1299 <D>35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1300-1599 <D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1600-2999 <D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3000 or more <D>15</D></ITAG></ITAG>If the initial survey results in a low response rate, the State shouldfollow-up with employers in an effort to increase the response rate. Nodetermination shall be made based on a sample of less than three employers.3. <T3>Coverage of employers, workers and kinds of remuneration</T3>. (a.)In determining the appropriate universe of employers and workers to survey,the State should use available sources such as the ETA 202 file, employerorganizations, universities and State agricultural offices.(b.) When conducting surveys SESAs must inform employers that they areseeking information on the actual wage rate paid to domestic workers only;i.e., workers for whom the employer has completed an I-9, INS's Employementof Eligibility Verification form. H-2A workers are excluded.(c.) A wage rate means actual cash remuneration to a worker by an employerin payment for services rendered. It does not mean an hourly rate whichhas been calculated from piece rate earnings. Fringe benefits such as freehousing and free meals mut not be counted as part of the wage rate. A wagerate may be a piece rate or an hourly, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly rate.A bonus component may be part of a wage rate. For example, an apple pickingrate may be $.70 per bushel plus $.05 end of season bonus; the $.05 bonusmust be shown separately.B. Methods of Collection and Sources of Wage Survey InformationWhile most survey information may be obtained by telephone or mail contacts,attempts should be made to include a representative number of personalemployer interviews in all wage surveys in order to supplement and verifysurvey information obtained by telephone or mail. (See form ETA 232A).The State agency must assure itself that information gathered is representativeof the rates being paid in the crop activity.C. Special Procedures for Unexpected SituationsThere may be situations where surveys have not been required in the pastand employers will unexpectedly submit requests to the Job Service forworkers. Although the timing of unanticipated requests may preclude theapplication of standard survey procedures, the State agency is still responsiblefor advising the Regional Office on the acceptability of wage rates offeredin job orders. In such situations, where time constraints require a rapiddetermination regarding prevailing wage rates, the following procedureswill apply:1. Depending on the amount of time available, attempt to collect surveydata solely by telephone after determining the appropriate universe. Indetermining the universe, refer to the ETA 202 file or other sources whichare readily available.2.Examine open and closed local job orders involving the same or similaroccupation, activity, and crop.3. Obtain information from local agricultural employers who do not usethe Employment Service to obtain workers.4. Consult U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies and affiliates suchas Cooperative Extension Services and the National Agricultural StatisticsService's State statistician. Also contact colleges and universities withstaff conversant in the agricultural sciences.5. Consult farmworker organizations (include JTPA 402 grantees) and agriculturalemployer organizations, such as the Farm Bureau.6. Consider whatever documentation the requesting employer or employershave to submit.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Prevailing Wage Findings and Determinations</ITAG>A. Arraying Collected DataRates paid to workers covered in the survey should be listed in descendingorder and grouped by unit of pay, such as by the bushel or by the hour.Handling of special kinds of pay is addressed in the following paragraphs.1. <T3>Overtime and piece rate earnings. </T3>Prevailing wage rate findingsare based upon actual wage rates paid by employers. Average earnings datawhich may show overtime or piece-rate wages converted to hourly rates areexcluded.2. <T3>Atypical rates. </T3>The collected wage rates arrayed in section 4of the final 232 report and used in determining the prevailing rate shouldbe unaffected by unique or unusual factors. An example of such a factoris an earthquake, flood, hurricane, tornado or other Act of God resultingin employer escalated rates referred to as ``hardship'' rates by some employers.(These rates are set in emergencies to compensate for expected big decreasein workers' earnings.) Although the ``hardship'' rate is not used, it shouldbe shown as part of the array and footnoted with an explanation of whyit was judged to be atypical.3. <T3>Collective-bargained rates. </T3>In areas where agricultural employeesare members of collective bargaining units, the unions will sometimes specifywage rates to be paid in their contracts with agricultural employers. Forthe purpose of determining prevailing wage rates, collective bargainingrates should not be given special treatment. These rates, if actually paidto workers, should be included in the normal array of wages from the survey.4. <T3>Bonuses. </T3>For wage rates that include bonus rates in the same unitsas the base rates (e.g., 25 cents per box plus a 5 cent bonus per box),add the bonus to the base rate, in each case, to determine the gross rate.Array the gross rates including the piece rates within each gross ratein descending order. Each base rate and bonus combination and each piecerate without bonus will be considered separate rates for purposes of determiningthe prevailing rate. For wage rates that include bonus rates in units differentfrom the base unit (e.g., $1.10 per hour plus 40 cents per box), treateach such rate and bonus arrangement as a different unit of payment.Following is an example of how bonuses should be arrayed in completingthe final ETA-232 report.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7,7</C> <H1>Rate (per box)</H1><H1>Gross rate</H1><H1>Number of workers Total: 1,000</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">$0.20+$.02 bonus <D>$0.22 </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  .17+$.04 bonus <D>.21 </D><D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  .20+(no bonus) <D>.20 </D><D>150</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  .18+$.02 bonus <D>.20 </D><D>250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  .17+$.03 bonus <D>.20 </D><D>300</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  .16+$.04 bonus <D>.20 </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  .19+(no bonus) <D>.19 </D><D>50</D></ITAG></ITAG>In any situation where a base rate bonus combination becomes prevailing,the base rate continues to be shown separately from the bonus such as $0.18+$0.02quality bonus.5. <T3>Rate Schedule. </T3>A rate schedule (also referred to as a schedule-of-rates)which is prepared by an employer prior to the start of the work season,is a list of rates to be paid based on varying conditions affecting a productwhen it is harvested. Varying conditions may involve size, estimated yieldor other factors. Following is an example of how an employer may preparea pre-season rate schedule for harvesting cucumbers:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,r10</C> <H1>Rate to be paid per bushel</H1><H1>Size in diameter</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">$0.80 <D>\1/2\ inch.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.70 <D>1 inch.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.60 <D>1\1/2\ inches.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.50 <D>2 inches.</D></ITAG></ITAG>Such a schedule should be entered in the array as if it were a separaterate. Contingent on the number of workers covered by the schedule and relatedcollected wage data, the schedule could be determined to be prevailing.6. <T3>Task Rates. </T3>A task rate is a method of payment which is basedupon a measure of production which is not amenable to being quantified,such as per field of beets weeded or per row of sugar cane cut. Task ratesnormally vary from day-to-day, depending upon such factors as complexityand difficulty of the ``task'' involved at a specific point in time, suchas density of weeds to be removed, and precise wage rates are not set aheadof time. In situations where task rates ae used, it wil not be possibleto establish a prevailing wage finding. SESAs should collect informationon the range of task rates paid, which may vary from field to field dependingupon circumstances, and report them, noting that a task rate situationdoes not lend itself to a prevailing wage determination.B. Conversion of Different Units of Payment to a Common BaseWhen possible, different units of production in a crop activity must beconverted to a common base. For example, collected data for a specificactivity such as fruit picking may include several proportional units ofa bushel such as \5/8\'s of a bushel, 1 bushel, 1-and-\1/8\ bushels anda 15-bushel bin. All of these rates can be converted into a single standardizedrate such 1 bushel.As another example, in some situations different methods of pay for irrigationwork can be converted to a common base. For example, if there is a proportionalmile line in a survey area consisting of a standard number of pipes orjoints then the collected pay data for lines, pipes and joints can be convertedto the <T3>single dominant unit of payment.</T3>In all cases, the converted single unit would be shown in item 4 of theETA 232 report while the collected raw data information would be attachedto the report. The general process for converting these rates is illustratedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="81">Conversion of proportional bushel units</ITAG>andbullet; Convert 1-and-\1/8\ bushels rate to a 1 bushel rate when the 1-and-\1/8\bushels rate is $.70.<ITAG tagnum="15">1-and-\1/8\ bushels=.70</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">\1/8\=0.125</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1-and-\1/8\ bushels=1.125 bushels</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1.000 bu divided by 1.125 bushels=.889</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">.889andmultiply;$.70=$0.62 p/bushel</ITAG>andbullet; Convert a 1 bushel rate to a 1-and-\1/8\ bushels rate when thebushel rate is .62.<ITAG tagnum="15">1 bushel=$.62</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">\1/8\ of a bushel=0.125 increase</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">$.62andmultiply;1.125=$.70 p/1-and-\1/8\ bushels</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>1 bushel=2,150.40 cu.in.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1-and-\1/8\ bushels=2,419.22 cu.in.</ITAG>andbullet; Convert a \5/8\ bushel rate to a 1 bushel rate when the \5/8\bushel rate is $.45.<ITAG tagnum="15">\5/8\ bushel=$.45</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1 bu=(8/8)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">\1/8\ bu=$.45 divided by \5/8\=.45 divided by 5=.09 (\1/8\ bu)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1 bushel (8/8)=.09 (\1/8\ bu)andmultiply;8=$.72 p/bushel</ITAG>andbullet; Convert a 15-bushel bin rate to a bushel rate when the bin rateis $10.50.<ITAG tagnum="15">$10.50 divided by 15 bushels=$.70 p/bushel</ITAG>C. Procedure for Makinga Prevailing Wage Finding1. <T3>One or more units of payment.</T3> If the report consists of a singleunit of payment (e.g., by the hour or by the bushel) the finding can bedetermined by application of the 40/51 percent rules which are explainedbelow. If more than one unit of payment is shown in the report, followthe table below in determining which units of payment are subject to wagefindings. For example, if the sample size is 150 workers and at least 30percent are paid by the hour and at least 30 percent are paid by the bushel,then a wage finding shall be determined for both groups (those paid hourlyand those paid by the bushel), by applying the 40/51 percent rules withineach group.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7</C> <H1>Sample size \1\</H1><H1>Percentage of workers needed in a pay unit to make a wage finding</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">10-99<D>35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100-299<D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">300-699<D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">700-1299<D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1300-2999<D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3000 and over<D>10</D><F>\1\ Sample size means the </F><T3>total number of workers </T3>shown on each separate ETA 232 report.</ITAG></ITAG>2. <T3>Local and intra/interstate rates. </T3>When arraying is completed,determine if ``local'' and ``Intra/Interstate'' totals under section 4of the 232 report each constitute at least 25 percent of the ``total''workers. If below 25 percent, no separate wage determination is required.Workers in these categories will be subject to the determination applicableto the larger group.3. <T3>The 40/51 percent rules. </T3>The 40/51 percent rules are applied toeach of the units determined to be subject to a wage finding. If withinthe unit of payment a single wage rate, or schedule of rates, covers atleast 40 percent of total workers in the unit, that single rate or scheduleis the prevailing rate, and no further action is needed for that unit.If no single rate in the unit covers at least 40 percent of the workers,then the 51 percent rule is applied to determine the prevailing rate. Theprocedure is to start at the bottom of the rates arrayed in descendingorder. Begin counting the number of workers covered and count upward until51 percent of the workers in the unit are included. The rate reached atthis point is the prevailing rate. Both the 40 and 51 percent rules areapplied to all three columns under Section 4 of the 232 report: Total workers,local and intra/inter-state. The highest rate determined among the threecolumns is the prevailing rate.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Example:</T3> 40 percent rule<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,7,7,7,7</C><T4>U.S. Workers</T4><H1>Rate (per bushel) </H1><H1>Total </H1><H1>Local </H1><H1>Intra/interstate</H1><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>300 </D><D>170 </D><D>130</D><ITAG tagnum="1">$0.75<D>18</D><D>18</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.70<D>26</D><D>22</D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.62<D>53</D><D>28</D><D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.60<D>\2\ 123</D><D>22</D><D> \2\ 101</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.56<D>47</D><D>47</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.55 <D>13</D><D>13 </D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.50<D>20</D><D>20</D><D>0</D><F>\2\ Prevailing rate per 40% rule. 40% of 300 total is 120, 40% of 170total is 68, and 40% of 130 total is 52.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Example:</T3> 51 percent rule.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,7,7,7,7</C><T4>U.S. Workers</T4><H1>Rate (per bushel) </H1><H1>Total </H1><H1>Local </H1><H1>Intra/interstate</H1><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>200 </D><D>160 </D><D>\1\ 40</D><ITAG tagnum="1">$0.72<D>19</D><D>19</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.60<D>25</D><D>25</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.55<D>49</D><D>9</D><D>40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.52<D> \2\ 50</D><D> \2\ 50</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.50<D>27</D><D>27</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.48 <D>20</D><D>20 </D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.45<D>10</D><D>10</D><D>0</D><F>\1\ No finding required since 40 is less than 25% of total workers (200).</F><F>\2\ Prevailing rate per 51% rule. 51% of 200 total is 102 and 51% of160 total is 82.</F></ITAG></ITAG>D. Report Submittal and Prevailing Wage DeterminationWhen the survey is completed and the data have been properly grouped andarrayed, a separate ETA 232 report is prepared for each specific activitycovered. It is not unusual for a single survey to result in the preparationof several Reports. The ETA-232 report showing survey findings must beprepared and submitted within five weeks to the ETA Regional Office andthe National Office. (See page    regarding distribution).A report must be submitted for each survey, whether or not it results ina finding. The reason for not making a finding should be explained. (Whenfor any reason a wage finding cannot be made, the National Office willexamine other approaches for deriving an acceptable minimum wage for agriculturalclearance order purposes).The wage findings in the report are preliminary until reviewed by the NationalOffice. The findings become final when the State is notified by ETA. Thiswill always occur when temporary foreign workers are employed or have beenrequested. When temporary aliens are not involved, it is possible thatthe State will not be notified of review results unless there are incorrectfindings. In this situation, the submitted report becomes final 40 workingdays after being mailed to the National Office. (The State may requestan expedited review and/or notification of review results on any submittedreport).<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Prevailing Wage Applicability to Employer Job Orders</ITAG>A. GeneralThe wage rate which must be offered by employers on clearance orders shallbe at least as high as the highest of the ``all workers'' rate, the ``local''rate. or the ``intra/interstate'' rate, provided such rates are no lowerthan the legal State or Federal minimum wage or the AEWR (where applicable).Normally, the wage finding from a survey is applied during the next year.For example, a finding from an October 1989 apple harvest survey will beapplied in evaluating job orders submitted for the 1990 apple harvest inthe same area. (See page 10 regarding emergency situations.)Special situations are addressed in the following paragraphs.B. Alternative Piece RatesFor activities paid on a piece-rate basis, the State agency may acceptjob orders which offer piece rates that differ from those specified inthe prevailing wage findings, if the employer making such an offer candemonstrate that the proposed piece rate or schedule-of-rates are necessarybecause of the employer's specific type of operation and that they canreasonably be expected to produce earnings for the average worker, whichare no less than those received under the rate or rates determined to beprevailing. (See 20 CFR part 653, subpart F for further requirements).For example, although the established prevailing wage rate for pickingcucumbers may be $0.50 per bushel, a particular grower may desire to pickby varying sizes and pay the workers accordingly. Therefore, upon requestthe grower may be allowed to offer several rates based on the diameteror length of the cucumbers picked. The burden of proof in this situationis on the employer who would be requested to provide supporting payrollinformation relating to productivity, earnings and other factors.C. BonusesWage offers on intra/interstate clearance orders must include a base ratecomponent not less than the base rate component of the prevailing wage.The following example is illustrative:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7,7</C> <H1>Rate (per box)</H1><H1>Gross rate</H1><H1>Number of workers</H1><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D> </D><D>1,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">$0.20 + $0.02 bonus \1\ <D>$0.22 </D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.17 + $0.04 bonus \1\ <D>.21 </D><D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.20 + no bonus <D>.20 </D><D>150</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.18 + $0.02 bonus \1\ <D>.20 </D><D>250</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.17 + $0.03 bonus \1\ <D>.20 </D><D>300</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.16 + $0.04 bonus \1\ <D>.20 </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">.19 + no bonus <D>.19 </D><D>50</D><F>\1\ End of season bonus.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Using the 51-percent rule (since no single rate accounts for 40 percentof the workers), the prevailing wage rate is a base rate of 18 cents plus2 cents bonus. The rates of 17 cents plus 3 cents bonus and 16 cents plus4 cents bonus equal the 18-cent plus 2 cents bonus prevailing gross rate,and the rate of 17 cents plus 4 cents bonus exceeds it, but they are notacceptable for clearance orders because the base rates are less than theprevailing base rate of 18 cents.D. Establishment of Special Hourly Rates Under Certain CircumstancesIn rare situations where only a prevailing piece rate finding has beenmade by the National Office based on a SESA prevailing wage survey andan employer wishes to pay on an hourly basis, the following procedure applies:(1) Calculate the average hourly earnings figure (weighted by the numberof hours worked) for piece-rate-paid domestic workers in the area, cropactivity, and occupation, using previous years' earnings data_preferablythree years. The earnings data are obtained either from applicable SESAprevailing wage surveys, or by special surveys of employers' domestic workerpayroll records. Calculate this average for each year for which earningsdata are available, up to a maximum of three years.(2) Discount the average hourly earnings figure for each year by 20 percent.Add the discounted yearly rates and divide by the total number of yearsto obtain the prevailing hourly rate which the employer must offer.(3) Where hourly-paid domestic workers are also working in the area andactivity and are included in the SESA surveys, their earnings also haveto be factored into the calculation of the prevailing hourly rate as follows:(a) Weight the hourly rates paid by the number of hours worked to obtaina single weighted hourly average. Then calculate a combined weighted averageof average earnings figures of both hourly-paid and piece-rate-paid workers,weighting by total number of hours worked.(b) When the number of hours worked is not available for hourly-paid workers,use the number of workers to obtain the weighted average hourly figure.Similarly, use the total number of workers rather than hours worked whencalculating the combined weighted average of hourly-paid and piece-rate-paidworkers.The annual rates obtained by method (a) or (b) are then added togetherand divided by the number of years to obtain the prevailing hourly rate.The National Office is to be consulted in <T3>all</T3> instances where such a determination is required. NationalOffice staff will provide guidance on specifics, including selection ofthe base years and the factoring in of hourly wages, to insure correctapplication of this procedure to each individual circumstance.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Example:</T3> The tables below are illustrative:Apple Pickers (FreshMarket), 1989<ITAG tagnum="81">I. </ITAG><T3>Piece Rate Workers </T3><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L1,tp0,i1,6,5,1,6,1,8</C> <H1>Number of workers </H1><H1>Hours worked</H1><H1>x</H1><H1>Average hourly earnings \1\</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Total earnings</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">5<D>77</D><D> </D><D>$12.04</D><D> </D><D>$927.08</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>64</D><D> </D><D>3.83</D><D> </D><D>245.12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>8</D><D> </D><D>6.75</D><D> </D><D>54.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12<D>252</D><D> </D><D>4.14</D><D> </D><D>1,043.28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>10</D><D> </D><D>2.80</D><D> </D><D>28.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>116</D><D> </D><D>5.54</D><D> </D><D>642.64</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>108</D><D> </D><D>6.75</D><D> </D><D>729.00</D><R>sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">29<D>635</D><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D><D>3,669.12</D><F>$3,669.1 divided by 635 hrs.=$5.78 (weighted) andmultiply; .80 (20% discount).</F><F>\1\ To obtain, multiply rate of pay by units of production and divideresults by hours worked.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">II. </ITAG><T3>Hourly Workers</T3><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L1,tp0,i1,6,5,1,6,1,8</C> <H1>Number of workers</H1><H1>Hours worked</H1><H1>andmultiply;</H1><H1>Hourly pay</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Total earnings</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>12</D><D/> <D>$5.75</D><D/> <D>$69.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>1</D><D/> <D>5.00</D><D/> <D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>47</D><D/> <D>4.50</D><D/> <D>211.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>60</D><D/> <D>4.35</D><D/> <D>261.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>48</D><D/> <D>4.00</D><D/> <D>192.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>15</D><D/> <D>3.75</D><D/> <D>56.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>1</D><D/> <D>3.50</D><D/> <D>3.50</D><R>sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18<D>184</D><D/> <D/> <D/> <D>798.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">$798.25 divided by 184 hrs.=$4.34 (weighted)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">III. </ITAG><T3>Final Computation for 1989</T3><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1,tp0,i1,s25,7,1,14</C> <H1>Number of workers</H1><H1>Hours worked</H1><H1> </H1><H1>Computed rates</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">29 (piece rates)<D>635</D><D/>andmultiply;<D>$4.62=$2,933.70</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">18 (hourly rates)<D>184</D><D/>andmultiply;<D>4.34=$798.56</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>819</D><D/> <D>3,732.26</D><ITAG tagnum="21">$3,732.26/819 hrs.=$4.56 (rate for 1989)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A: Plan for Agricultural Wage Survey</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Title: PLAN FOR AGRICULTURAL WAGE SURVEY</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Form Number: </T3>N/A_Narrative Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Frequency: </T3>Once each season by the State for each crop activityin which:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(a) Fifty (50) or more domestic workers recruited by the EmploymentService were employed in the previous season, or may reasonably be expectedto be employed in the current season; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(b) Fifty (50) or more H-2A workers were employed in the previousseason, or employers have requested or may be expected to request fifty(50) or more H-2A workers in the current season; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">(c) The crop or crop activity has been designated by the ETA as animportant crop or crop activity, because of its status in the nationaleconomy, because large numbers of workers not recruited through the JobService are employed, or for other reasons.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Purpose and Content: </T3>To provide to ETA Regional Offices, for reviewand approval, State agency Plans for the conduct of agricultural wage surveys.Each Plan identifies the agricultural areas covered and the specific cropactivity, sampling criteria to be used on the survey, and any special informationdeemed necessary for Regional Office use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Prepared by: </T3>State Central Office staff.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T3>Distribution: </T3>The original and one copy to the Regional Officeat least 90 calendar days prior to the week of the survey.
