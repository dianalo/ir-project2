BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists on Friday released 50 parasiticIsraeli wasps, each smaller than a pinhead, hoping the pests wouldzero in on Southern California's growing ash whitefly population.   The wasps were sent to work in a suburban Encino ash tree in thefirst of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fightagainst the problem flies.   ``This particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill allthe ash whiteflies,'' said Tom Bellows, a University of California,Riverside, entomologist supervising the experiment. ``Thisparticular trial is to see if the wasps can live successfully inour Southern California climate.''   Bellows released the imported predators into what he calls a``sleeve cage,'' a finely woven mesh cloth fitted over a treebranch so that all of the wasps will remain in one place.   Otherwise, scientists monitoring the experiment would have tosearch the whole tree and beyond to find the wasps, Bellowsexplained.   The ash whitefly infestation is not the only agricultural battlebeing waged in Southern California. Record numbers of exotic insectpests have invaded Los Angeles County this year, posing a threat tothe state's $16 billion-a-year farm economy.   Efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly, which lays itseggs in more than 250 types of fruit, has cost taxpayers at least$10 million so far, county officials said.   Scientists also are scrambling to deal with invasions byJapanese beetles, Russian wheat aphids, gypsy moths, fire ants andother bugs found in faraway lands _ but foreign to the UnitedStates.   ``We are convinced that it's because you are the nation'smelting pot,'' said Gera Curry, a spokeswoman for the CaliforniaDepartment of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento.   The region's booming immigrant population is bringing incontraband fruits and vegetables from native lands, she said.   The people responsible don't seem to realize their shipments ofproduce also carry alien pests that thrive in Southern California'swarm climate, Curry said.   One of the most ruinous is the ash whitefly, which sucks vitalfluids from tree leaves and deposits a sticky ooze that discolorsfruit, stains patios and ruins car paint.   The ash whiteflies, which have no natural enemies in the UnitedStates, were first discovered in the San Fernando Valley lastsummer. They were apparently imported accidentally from Europe, theMiddle East or Africa, where they are common.   The parasite wasps were imported from Israel, where they act asthe ash whitefly's natural enemy.   The wasp has no sting, but kills by laying its eggs inside ashwhitefly larvae, Bellows said. After the wasps' eggs hatch, theyeat their way out of the whitefly larvae, killing the pest.   If the series of experiments set for this month are successful,Bellows said hundreds of thousands of insect predators will bereleased next spring.</TEXT></DOC>
