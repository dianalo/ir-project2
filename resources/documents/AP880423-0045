(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fires set around the world to clear forestsand agricultural fields may cause long-term damage to theenvironment, including depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, NASAresearchers say.   Such ``biomass'' burning once was considered insignificant as aglobal hazard, said Dr. Joel Levine, a senior research scientist atthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration's LangleyResearch Center.   Concern about ozone depletion has focused on products ofindustrialized nations, such as chlorofluorocarbons released fromaerosol sprays, refrigeration equipment and in the manufacture offoam plastic containers.   But Levine said Third World countries, where outdoor burning iscommon, also may be contributing heavily to ozone depletion and thecreation of the so-called greenhouse effect, in which certain gasesin the atmosphere are believed to be raising temperatures on Earth.   ``The conclusion of this work is that on the global scale, theburning of forests and the burning of agricultural fields is avery, very significant source of the most environmentallysignificant gases,'' he told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Theseinclude nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, carbon dioxide, methane andcarbon monoxide.   This could have important implications for ozone depletion,since nitrogen oxides are believed responsible for about 70 percentof the ozone destroyed in the stratosphere, Levine said.   By comparison, chlorofluorocarbons and other manmade chlorinegases account for less than 10 percent of the ozone destruction, hesaid.   A NASA team headed by Levine and atmospheric scientist WesleyCofer III is studying the extent and the content of fires todetermine their possible effects on the environment.   The National Academy of Sciences has estimated that 2-5 percentof the Earth's land surface is burned each year, a far greater massthan thought a decade or so ago.   Levine said satellite photos obtained from the Department ofDefense show that 5 percent may be a conservative estimate. Thenighttime photos, taken during the early- and mid-1970s andrecently declassified, reveal clusters of lights across sparselypopulated territory, such as Central Africa.   These lights represent fires, Levine believes. By reviewinghundreds of such photos this summer, Levine said the team hopes tomore closely determine the extent of burning.   The researchers have studied individual fires in California,Florida, Canada and elsewhere to determine the composition of smokeand gauge the effect fires have on soil. Researchers found thatemissions of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from the soil increasedtenfold after the fires.   The soil emissions are released by microbes, tiny organisms thatfind a feast of nutrients in the ash from the fires, saidmicrobiologist Penelope Boston.   Ozone protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultravioletrays. Scientists say ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth couldincrease 5 percent to 20 percent by the early 21st century.Potential hazards include increases in skin cancer rates and damageto eyes.   Biomass burning may have a similar effect in producinggreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide,Levine said.   Greenhouse gases trap infrared heat in the Earth's atmosphere,leading to global warming that could melt ice at the North andSouth poles and lead to flooding of low-lying coastal areas.</TEXT></DOC>
