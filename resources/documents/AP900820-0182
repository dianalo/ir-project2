(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cockroaches might prefer to starveto death than scurry anywhere near powerful repellents thatresearchers hope can be used to build roach-proof homes andbusinesses.   Richard Brenner has spent six years creating a deterrent tocockroaches as an entomologist for the U.S. Department ofAgriculture's Gainesville, Fla., research lab.   He has worked with Air Vent Inc. of Peoria Heights to developthe repellents and a deadly new bait that someday might provideowners of infested homes and businesses a lethal one-two punch forcontrolling the pesky insect.   ``There's no silver bullet to do the job of cockroacheradication,'' Brenner said. ``No single solution will ever solvecockroach problems.   ``But we're coming up with some things that will preventinfestation and eliminate the growing number of health problemswe've linked to cockroaches.''   The products resulted from a two-year research project funded byAir Vent.   Mike Daniels, national sales manager for Air Vent, envisionsputting the repellent in insulation and other constructionmaterials.   And Air Vent is ready to market the bait as part of a new atticventilation system, designed with Brenner's help, that is designedto drive roaches out of attics.   Brenner's research has determined that cockroaches often enter ahome through roof vents and small openings. The insects preferwarm, moist, dark environments to breed and find attics idealbecause of the static air.   Other ideas for the repellents include using them on cardboardboxes that carry food and attract roaches when they sit inwarehouses and storerooms.   The repellents are five years from receiving EPA approval forsale to the public, Brenner said. But the attic ventilation systemand bait could reach the marketplace within a year, he said.   The investment may be worth the wait. Brenner estimates that$1.5 billion is spent each year on pesticides to kill cockroaches.   Another benefit of the research was Brenner's discovery thatcockroaches are responsible for serious allergy problems.   His study found cockroaches produce allergens that affect anestimated 10 million to 14 million people. He said the cockroachallergens are the second most common allergy causer amongasthmatics.   ``We need to design more insect-resistent structures andeliminate infestation by cockroaches,'' Brenner said. ``That's whywe're excited about these products. We are making some progress.''</TEXT></DOC>
