Name of Standards.Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) (FIPS PUB xxx).2. Category of Standard.Software Standard, Electronic Data Interchange.3. ExplanationThis publication announces the adoption, as a Federal Information ProcessingStandard, of identical national and international voluntary standards forEDI. In EDI, information that would be traditionally conveyed on paperdocuments is provided in an electronic format according to establishedrules and procedures. The formatted data may be transmitted to one or morerecipients over telecommunications lines or physically transported on storagemedia.In EDI, the data on each type of document are transmitted together as astandard formatted message type or ``transaction set.'' Underlying standards,integral to the use of the message type standards, define data types, dataelements, data segments, and message transmission envelopes. The messagetype standards together with the underlying standards from a family ofinterconnected standards that must be treated together as a whole.The standardization of message formats, and of data segments and elementswithin the messages, makes possible the formulation, decomposition, andprocessing of the messages by computer.This FIPS generally adopts the families of standards known as X12 and EDIFACT.These standards have been developed respectively by Accredited StandardsCommittee X12 on Electronic Data Interchange, accredited by the AmericanNational Standards Institute (ASC X12), and by the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe_Working Party (Four) on Facilitation of InternationalTrade Procedures (UN/ECE/WP./4).4.

ObjectivesThe primary objectives of this standard are:a. To promote the achievement of the benefits of EDI: reduced paperwork,fewer transcription errors, faster response time for procurement needs,reduced inventory requirements, and faster payment of vendors;b. To ease the interchange of data sent via EDI by the assurance of commondata formats for contents and envelopes;c. To minimize the cost of EDI implementation by preventing duplicationof effort.8. Applicability<ITAG tagnum="81">8.1 Conditions of Application</ITAG>This standard is applicable to any type of information interchanged betweenorganizations that (1) consists of a set of fields or data elements containingeither character or binary data, (2) is in such common use that a standardformat has been or could be created, and (3) the use of computers for messageformulation, decomposition, and processing would be cost-effective. Thisstandard is not intended to apply to messages that are primarily free-form,e.g., composed of text.<ITAG tagnum="81">8.2 Use of GOSIP</ITAG> EDI transmissions over telecommunications lines shall employ the commonset of data communication protocols defined in FIPS PUB 146 (GOSIP). Acquisitionof products and services employing GOSIP shall follow the implementationschedule specified in FIPS PUB 146.<ITAG tagnum="81">8.3 Subject Matter</ITAG>Primary applicability of this FIPS PUB on EDI is to business information.This term encompasses the entire range of information associated with commercialand business transactions, and with field unit supply. Examples are for:a. <T3>Vendor search and selection: </T3>Price/sales catalogs, bids, proposals,requests for quotations, notices of contract solicitation, debarment data,trading partner profiles;b. <T3>Contract award: </T3>Notices of award, purchase orders, purchase orderacknowledgments, purchase order changes;c. <T3>Product data: </T3>Specifications, digitized drawings, manufacturinginstructions, reports of test results, safety data;d. <T3>Shipping, forwarding, and receiving: </T3>Shipping manifests, billsof lading, shipping status reports, receiving reports;e. <T3>Customs: </T3>Tariff filings, customs declarations;f. <T3>Payment: </T3>Invoices, remittance advices, payments, payment statusinquiries, payment acknowledgments;g. <T3>Inventory control: </T3>Stock level reports, resupply requests, warehouseactivity reports;h. <T3>Maintenance: </T3>Service schedules and activity, warranty data;i. <T3>Tax-related data: </T3>Tax information and filings.<ITAG tagnum="81">8.4 Additional Applicability</ITAG>This standard also is applicable to other information transmitted or receivedby agencies of the Federal Government and meeting the criteria specifiedin paragraph 8.1. Usage may concern, for example, environmental or naturalresource status; criminal justice; demographic, economic educational, orhealth statistics; Government facility status; etc. Agencies employingsuch message data are not required to adopt the national or internationalstandards specified in this FIPS, but are encouraged to do so (by submittingtheir message types for standardization by ASC X12) in order to achievethe benefits of common envelope processing protocols and common data elements.9. SpecificationsDocuments are available that define the standard message types for bothX12 and EDIFACT, as well as the underlying standards for both families.Developments are continuing in both systems.<ITAG tagnum="81">9.1 Source of Documents</ITAG>Documents defining both the X12 and EDIFACT families of standards are availablefrom: Data Interchange Standards Association (DISA), 1800 Diagonal Road_Suite355, Alexandria, VA 22314, Phone: (703) 548-7005.DISA serves as the secretariat for ASC X12; the latter includes the NorthAmerican EDIFACT Board (NAEB) as a standing task group.

Additional message types are continually being identified,developed, and submitted for standardization.Inovice Message_(TRADE/WP.4/R.527).<ITAG tagnum="81">9.4 Versions of Documents</ITAG>Dates of issue have not been stated for the documents listed above, sincethe documents are subject to periodic update and revision.X12 documents are identified by version number; updates are identifiedby release number. The 1983 standards are referred to as Version 001; the1986 standards (the most recent set) are Version 002. Release 003 to Version002 was published in April 1989. In each X12 transmission, the utilizedversion and release values are transmitted at a particular point withinthe header.UN/ECE/WP.4 is in the process of developing a policy on identificationof versions and releases. EDIFACT Directories are being updated twice ayear and are identified by a number of the form yy.r, where yy is the lasttwo digits of the year, and r is the release number for the year (either1 or 2), e.g., 89.1.10. Implementation<ITAG tagnum="81">10.1 Schedule for Adoption</ITAG>This standard is effective six months after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce.Agencies procuring or upgrading EDI systems after the effective date shalluse either X12 standards or EDIFACT.<ITAG tagnum="81">10.2 Selection of X12 or EDIFACT</ITAG>Until the general acceptance of a single voluntary standard, agencies mayutilize X12 standards or EDIFACT. In selecting a standard, agencies shouldattempt to maximize economy and efficiency and to minimize the cost imposedon U.S. businesses. Consistent with these two criteria, agencies shoulduse X12 standards for domestic interchanges, and X12 or EDIFACT for internationalinterchanges. Agencies may employ both standards where required to meetthe needs of trading partners and to be consistent with the two criteria.<ITAG tagnum="81">10.3 Continued Use of EDI Industry Standards</ITAG>Existing systems employing widely used industry-specific EDI standardsmay continue to use those standards for three years following the effectivedate of this FIPS PUB. Industry-specific EDI standards may be used beyondthat time interval only if no equivalent X12 standards, either trial useof final, have been approved.<ITAG tagnum="81">10.4 Version Selection</ITAG>Agencies shall convert their systems to the most recent versions of theEDI standards, within six months of version adoption. Trading partnersmust be provided with sufficient advance notification of cut-over dates.Interchange partners must be aware of the version/release being used, inorder to successfully exchange data.<ITAG tagnum="81">10.5 Security and Authorization</ITAG>Agencies shall not limit security and authentication procedures to thoseadopted by ASC X12 or by UN/ECE/WP.4. Agencies shall employ appropriaterisk management techniques to determine the appropriate mix of securitycontrols needed to protect specific data and systems. The selection ofcontrols shall take into account procedures required under applicable lawsand regulations.11. WaiversUnder certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departmentsand agencies may approve waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards(FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to asenior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of title 44, U.S.C.Requests for waivers shall be granted only when:a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishmentof the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, orb. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is notoffset by Government-wide savings.Agency heads may act only upon written waiver requests containing the informationdetailed above. Agency heads may approve requests for waivers only by awritten decision which explains the basis upon which the agency head madethe required finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurementsensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall be sent to the:Director, National Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS Waiver Decisions,Technology Building, Room B-154, National Institute of Standards and Technology,Gaithersburg, MD 20899. In addition, notice of each waiver granted andeach delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptlyto the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representativesand the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be publishedpromptly in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.When the determination on a waiver request applies to the procurement ofequipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must bepublished in the Commerce Business Daily as part of the notice of solicitationfor offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made afterthat notice is published, by amendment to such notice.A copy of the waiver request, any supporting documents, the document approvingthe waiver request and any supporting and accompanying document(s), withsuch deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5U.S.C. 552(b), shall be part of the procurement documentation and retainedby the agency.12.
