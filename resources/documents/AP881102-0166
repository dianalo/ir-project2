National police director Cho Jong-suk issued a statement warningagainst the student activism and said authorities would ``harshlydeal with anybody found involved in illegal rallies anddemonstrations.''   Police released no figures, but local news reports said about6,000 students from 20 universities took part in variousanti-government protests in Seoul and elsewhere. No arrests werereported.   Anti-government demonstrations have been escalating in recentweeks. Radicals have threatened to raid Chun's house in Seoul onThursday, National Students Day.   About 4,000 police surrounded Chun's house and began checkingpassers-by.   Thousands more police were deployed in the capital afterauthorities were told that radical students might try to occupymajor government offices and foreign diplomatic missions.   Student leaders said they organized ``save-the-nation suicidesquads'' to assault Chun's house with firebombs and homemadeexplosives. Major street protests were planned near Chun's house,they said.   The threats came on the eve of President Roh Tae-woo's departureon an 11-day trip to Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Brunei.   Roh told legislators Wednesday his government will increaseefforts to ferret out all corruption and irregularities allegedlycommitted under Chun's seven-year tenure.   The president said he would oppose any political revenge againsthis predecessor.   Local newspapers, quoting unnamed senior government officials,said some of Chun's family members might be arrested on corruptioncharges before Roh returns home from the overseas trip Nov. 14.   Despite continuing government investigations of past corruptionand irregularities, critics argue that the Roh adminstration isreluctant to divulge alleged corruption involving Chun, his familymembers and associates.   Roh and Chun, both former army genrals, have been close friendssince they were classmates at Korea Military Academy in the 1950s.Roh succeeded Chun, who stepped down at the end of a seven-year termin February.   Chun has come under public fire for his alleged misuse of powerand involvement in financial and other scandals. One of hisbrothers, Chun Kyong-hwan, has been sentenced to seven years'imprisonment for taking bribes and embezzling millions of dollars ofofficial funds.</TEXT></DOC>
