But top military plannersand pilots reviewing the allied air war against Iraq say they ran intounexpected problems from the very start, forcing tactical improvisations.;   The officers say they were surprised by the resolve of Iraq's Republican Guardto remain in their dug-in positions and by the proliferation of Scud missilelaunchers in southern Iraq.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ALLIES OFTEN HAD TO WING IT IN AIR WARUNEXPECTED PROBLEMS LED TO IMPROVISATION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  War in the GulfSee related stories pages 1A and 14-15A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     They also overestimated the ability of their warplanes to destroy importantIraqi bridges with unguided bombs and had to make adjustments for badweather.;    But the allied air forces overcame these problems by divertingfrom their carefully scripted air strategy, trying out untested tactics andrushing new, advanced targeting equipment to Saudi Arabia.;    Since thefighting with Iraq ended, top U.S. Air Force commanders have been studyingdetails of the air campaign -- the most intensive ever waged -- to drawlessons for future conflicts. The assessments of the air war in this articleare based on interviews with senior Air Force officials, some of whom askednot to be identified.;    Changing nature of warfare;  Lt. Gen. CharlesHorner, the commander of allied air forces in the gulf, said in an interviewthat the war had established that radar-evading &quot;stealth&quot; technology and thepinpoint accuracy of precision-guided bombs were changing the nature of airwarfare. For instance, the F-117A Stealth fighter, using guided bombs,accounted for only 3 percent of allied aircraft but struck 43 percent of theIraqi targets that were hit, Air Force officials said.;    &quot;To do the thingsthat we did in Baghdad in the old days would have taken large numbers of bombswith a lot of damage to surrounding areas,&quot; Horner said. &quot;These guys went outthere, night after night, and took out individual buildings.&quot;;    Brig. Gen.Buster C. Glosson, a principal architect of the air campaign, said the allies'success had changed the definition of war. &quot;We've always looked at warfare asbeing speed, mass and surprise,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe we've changed thatforever to speed, precision and surprise.&quot;;    To overcome problems, airplanners used a combination of new technologies and improvised tactics:;   Missing the bridges;  (check) After more than 100 missions in which F-15E,F-16, and F/A-18 planes dropping unguided bombs failed to knock out any of 42important bridges in Iraq, American military planners directed F-117As andF-111 fighter-bombers to attack the spans with 500 pound laser-guided bombs.Using this new strategy, seven bridges were destroyed or severely damaged inthe first night.;    (check) Disappointed by the slow pace at which alliedfighter-bombers were destroying Iraqi tanks, military planners put together asquadron of highly proficient F-16 pilots, dubbed the Killer Scouts, withorders to pick out enemy targets for attack by other planes. Military plannersalso devised a new technique for killing Iraqi tanks buried under sandbags.Using night sensors that detected the heat from the tanks, F-111s and F-15Esblasted the entrenched armor with laser-guided bombs.;    (check) Whenattacking the Scud missile launchers proved to be more difficult thanexpected, the Air Force rushed new targeting sensors for F-15Es, in some casesstripping them from planes on testing grounds in the United States.;    WhenIraqi forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Air Force planners had only roughoutlines of how their untested but well-trained pilots would fight an air warin the Middle East. Only 5 percent of American pilots had previous combatexperience, although the younger pilots were the product of the most intensivetraining ever given to American aviators.;    Few early targets;  The earliestplan developed for Iraq had only about 80 targets for warplanes to attack,such as airfields, communications centers, and chemical weapons plants, AirForce officials say. Over the six months leading up to the air war, thattarget list swelled to more than 300. But the basic goal of the air campaignremained to overwhelm the Iraqis with round-the-clock bombing and fighterattacks.;    &quot;We wanted to seize the initiative immediately,&quot; Horner said. &quot;Inthe first 10 minutes of the war, we wanted to shock him and paralyze him.&quot;;   &quot;We flew as many combat missions in one day as he experienced in eight yearsof war with Iran,&quot; the general added, referring to the Iraqi military.;    Astretch of bad weather forced pilots to hit their carefully plotted targetsout of sequence, which meant that Iraqi air defenses stayed up longer.;    AirForce planners knew that coordinating waves of allied aircraft would be adaunting task. AWACS radar and air-control planes were given the task ofpreventing collisions and insuring that allied planes did not shoot at eachother. No allied planes were shot down by &quot;friendly&quot; fire, but Capt. LeeCherian, a senior weapons control officer on an AWACS plane, said AWACSofficers had to intervene on several occasions after nervous Navy pilotslocked their targeting radars onto Air Force planes returning from bombingruns in Iraq.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ERIC SCHMITT AND MICHAEL R.
