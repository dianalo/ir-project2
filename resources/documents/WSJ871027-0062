The spending decline was widely expected in response to the petering out of the auto incentives that had caused a revised 1.7% spurt in outlays in August. Many analysts now expect further weakness as a result of the stock-market crash, which they contend has dealt a blow to household wealth and consumer confidence.    &quot;We certainly expect that spending will be hurt by the drop in the stock market,&quot; said Sara Johnson, an economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. &quot;The big decline in the value of household financial assets is likely to make the consumer much more cautious about big-ticket items and taking on additional debt.&quot;    Even before the crash, she and other economists were expecting sluggish outlays ahead as consumers rebuild their savings after strong spending on cars and other items in the third quarter. Savings rose to 3.3% of after-tax income in September from 2.2% in August.    Richard Peterson, senior vice president at Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. in Chicago, said spending is likely to be restrained by the effect of the loss in household wealth, though he said the restraint could be tempered somewhat by the drop in interest rates. In any event, he said he was already expecting a decline in outlays in October as a result of the auto-sales effect.    Meantime, retail businesses that are monitoring consumers' reactions to the stock-market crash haven't been able to measure any broad response, as consumer attitudes have been difficult to read. Sales of luxury cars are hurting, but mid-market auto sales are about as expected.    Last month, spending rose slightly for services, and fell for both durable and nondurable goods.    The income increase was the strongest since a 1.1% jump in February. James F. Smith, chief economist of the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Texas at Austin, called the income number &quot;very good news.&quot; He said, &quot;Nothing is better for the consumer than having more income.&quot;    He played down the effect of the stock-market turmoil, contending that it's difficult to predict whether the crash will seriously hurt consumer confidence. Moreover, he said the wealth effect is likely to be small. &quot;In the last year we added a trillion dollars in wealth and that didn't cause a boom in consumption,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no reason to assume the loss of that much is going to cause a bust.&quot;    In September, wages and salaries rose 0.6% after a 0.9% increase in August. Factory payrolls increased 0.9% after a 1% rise in August.    The September drop brought consumer spending to a $3.010 trillion annual rate from a $3.026 trillion pace in August. Income ran at a $3.784 trillion pace, up from a $3.758 trillion rate in August. Previously, the department put the August spending increase at 1.5% and the income rise at 0.5%.    A spending-based price measure reported after a one-month lag rose 0.4% in August after a 0.1% rise in July.    The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars.                                             Sept.
