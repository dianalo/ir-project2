(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Leibson, Steven H.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>For engineers who routinely work with several types of processors,universal cross-assemblers can solve such problems as having tobuy a new assembler for each design.andP;  Although universal, orretargetable, cross-assemblers do not comply precisely with amicroprocessor's assembly language, for a wide variety ofprocessors they can translate assembly-language source code intomachine code.andP;  They also permit engineers to quickly developsubsets of standard processor instruction sets and to define oneprocessor's instruction set using another processor's mnemonics.andO;Commercially available universal cross-assemblers, such as AnyWareEngineering's CASM, are discussed in detail.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MicroprocessorsCross AssemblersProgram Development ToolsSoftware EngineeringAssembly LanguageSource CodeMachine LanguageMicrocomputers.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   Representative universal cross-assemblers.
