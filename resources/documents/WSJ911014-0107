With the aggressive pricing of the new machines, Compaqalso is cutting the prices of its SystemPro line of high-endcomputers by $1,000 to $3,000, making the prices competitivewith other makers.</LP><TEXT>   The moves should help the Houston computer concern makefurther inroads into the market for high-powered computerswith massive storage capabilities that increasingly are beingused to hold applications software, files and communicationsservices for computers linked by networks. Compaq, which hasbeen struggling with a slowdown in computer sales and areputation for expensive machines, is making the announcementat NetWorld, a trade show here this week.   Rod Canion, Compaq president and chief executive officer,said the company is targeting the biggest segment of thenetwork market with its new SystemPro/LT line. That segmentcovers small- to medium-sized networks that need a computerto store files that they share, but don't need the dualprocessors and extra features offered by Compaq's standardSystemPro line.   Currently, he said, customers are buying desktop computersto do the file server's job. But desktop machines are gettingsmaller, meaning they have less room for expanding theirmemory or storage systems. The new machines, which sit on thefloor or in a closet, rather than on a desk, will start withlarge memories and disk drives and users can upgrade them ifneeded.   Mr. Canion said the new line, which will include computersusing a single Intel Corp. 80386, 80486SX or 80486microprocessor, may reduce sales of Compaq's less advancedSystemPros, which are based on the 80386 chip. But he saidthat people who want to start with one processor andeventually upgrade to two will continue to buy the olderSystemPro machines.   John Dunkle, president of Workgroup Technologies, aHampton, N.H., market research firm, said the new line fillsa gap in Compaq's product line. The machines will costbetween $5,999 and $10,999, depending on the processor andother features; &quot;traditionally, file servers have cost morethan $10,000,&quot; he said. But Compaq won't have the market toitself: International Business Machines Corp. is expected tointroduce a similar line of machines on Wednesday, Mr. Dunklesaid.   To bring its older machines in line with its newer ones,Compaq said it is cutting the price on its 386-basedSystemPros by 6% to 8%, to between $10,999 and $16,999.Prices of its 486-based machines will fall 13% to 18%, tobetween $13,999 and $19,999.</TEXT></DOC>
