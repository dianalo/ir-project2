(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Western Union Corp., the communicationspioneer that has foundered because of heavy debts, said Friday itwas close to alleviating a substantial part of its obligations.   The company said enough bondholders appeared to have acceptedits offer to exchange high-yield ``junk bond'' debt securities for50 cents on the dollar.   The announcement suggested the company has avoided a cashcrisis. There had been persistent speculation that Western Unioncould have been forced into bankruptcy-court refuge because of itsdebts.   When the exchange offer expired midnight Thursday, preliminaryfigures indicated that $328.6 million of the debt securites, whichpaid 19\ percent interest, and $5.9 million of securities, whichpaid 16 percent interest, had been exchanged for the cash, companyspokesman Warren Bechtel said.   Western Union had offered to make the exchange for up to $350million worth of these securities. A minimum of $250 million of the19\ percent notes had to be tendered for the proposal to gothrough, Bechtel said.   The apparent success of the offer would mark the end of agrueling five-month ordeal for Western Union, which has beenstruggling to satisfy bondholders afraid they wouldn't get repaid.   The company, based in Saddle River, N.J. originally had proposedexchanging $530 million of high-yield notes for lower-yield notesplus stock. After numerous deadline extensions for acceptance ofthat offer, Western Union realized it wouldn't be accepted andoffered the cash instead.   ``I guess (the cash tender offer was successful) because asubstantial percentage of noteholders concluded that it was prudentto accept 50 cents on the dollar now rather than taking theirchances going forward on what they might get,'' Bechtel said.   When the offer went into effect Nov. 29, C. Richard Lehmann ofthe Bond Investors Association advised bondholders to ``take themoney and run.''   The exchange offer will erase $334 million from the liabilitiesside of Western Union's balance sheet, reducing the company's debtto about $311 million, Bechtel said.   Completion of the cash tender hinges on the sale of most ofWestern Union's Business Services Unit to American Telegraph andTelephone Co., Bechtel said.   That transaction, expected to go through Monday, will netWestern Union $175 million, Bechtel said.   Most of the money will be used to fund the cash tender offer;the rest will go to repay interest on an additional $196 millionworth of junk bonds that has been due since June 15, he said.   Western Union is one of the the country's oldest companies,known for its telegram and telex communications services. But thecompany has failed to keep pace with enormous leaps incommunications and information technology dominated by rivals suchas ATandamp;T and regional Bell phone companies. Western Union hasn'tmade a profit in years.</TEXT></DOC>
