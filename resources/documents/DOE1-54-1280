An analytical form of theopening time of the switch is given, which is checked by numerical computations.The condition for regular operation of an repetitive liquid-fuse openingswitch is demonstrated for a case involving the use of a closed channelflow of liquid metal through a liquid dielectric.</TEXT></DOC>
