With the solutions of time-dependent partial differentialequations in the space two-dimension, a model for fluid flow and heattransfer in a sedimentary basin was set up. In the application of theTissot's numerical model, the process of petroleum generation was includedin the model, and excess stratum pressure, capillary effects, and buoyancywere taken into consideration. The transfer process of petroleum andgas in the independent phase was also integrated in the model. Usingthe model, various geological parameter values were output on the two-dimensionalcross sections in each geological age, and petroleum migration patternsin the past could be estimated and petroleum geology could be reappeared.The model was applied to one of the oil field in the Niigata basin wherethe petroleum and gas generation in the anticline started in two millionyears ago, and the petroleum exists over 2500m depth under the ground.Capillary effects played a signigicant role for the downward migrationof the petroleum to the green tuff. Owing to the extent of the Siitaniand the Nishiyama sandstone layer, fluid flow patterns varied locallydue to the capillary effects, and the petroleum saturation rate and thepetroleum gathering efficiency in the sandstone layer increased.
