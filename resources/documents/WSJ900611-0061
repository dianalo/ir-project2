Notfor the first time, both inflation gauges are expected torise in the same month.   Normally, wholesale prices precede the important CPI byabout a week, giving economists time to adjust their maininflation forecasts. &quot;They're going to get no chance at allto revise&quot; this time, said Patrick Jackman, chief of the CPIbranch of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The May CPI, dueFriday, comes right on the heels of Thursday's PPI report.</LP><TEXT>   The week's other indicators take the latest pulse of aneconomy that has recently been slowing. They include: Mayretail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization,as well as April's trade deficit and business inventories.   But the inflation data are likely to steal the statisticalshow because already-disclosed reports have set the tone formost of the other numbers. Economists expect an uptick inproducer prices after two months of declines. The consensusview calls for a 0.2% increase, according to MMSInternational, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. Consumer prices arethought to have again increased, with the consensus alsoexpecting a 0.3% rise. In April, the CPI rose 0.2% and inMarch it jumped 0.5%.   The CPI trackers have been working for some time to shavedays off the release date of the index. Traditionally, theCPI takes longer to gather since its market basket iscompiled throughout the month. The PPI reflects one sampleday. Economists noted that eclipsing the time between reports(bureau rules prohibit sameday disclosure) could heightenanalysts' anxiety on months the gauges move in differentdirections. Such discrepancies aren't that uncommon, largelybecause the CPI is heavily weighted toward services, whilethe PPI doesn't measure services at all.   Richard Trainer, senior economist at Bank of Tokyo in NewYork, is in the camp that expects both inflation gauges torise a bit in May. But he's expecting only a 0.1% increase inMay producer prices, largely because of the past behavior ofprices for basics like feeds, foodstuffs and natural gas. &quot;Ithink we'll see some increase in some food and energy pricesat the consumer level, too,&quot; Mr. Trainer said. He expectsabout a 0.2% rise in the CPI.   He and some others expect cooler inflation over time.&quot;We're coming off some very, very high inflation numbers thatwere driven by special factors late last year,&quot; he said.Among the quirks, he cited unusually cold weather and a sharprunup in apparel costs. Mr. Trainer noted that the recenteconomic sluggishness indicates &quot;we're going to see somerelief in demand pressure on prices. Then we'll actually seesome dust settling down.&quot; But he added: &quot;It takes a while,perhaps {until} late summer or early fall. But then we'reback into the winter season.&quot;   Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp.in Philadelphia, believes that a flattening trend in moneysupply portends cooler inflation down the road. Adecelerating money supply would be &quot;very significant&quot; toproduce the slow-growth scenario necessary to sustain hislower-inflation forecast.   Mr. Levy has one of the most optimistic inflation outlooksfor the rest of 1990 and for 1991. &quot;By the end of 1991, we'llbe in the 3.25% range, maybe a little lower,&quot; he said.   The consensus view on retail sales, due Wednesday, expectsa 0.1% rise, following April's 0.6% drop. Sluggish auto salesare expected to again act as a drag on the overall number.Economists are particularly interested in any gains inapparel sales to determine if discounting drove up volume orwhether prices held.   Industrial output and capacity utilization, due Friday,are expected to rebound slightly. The consensus view callsfor output to rise 0.4%, which would put the operating ratearound 83.2%. In April, industrial production slipped 0.4%and capacity utilization was 83%.   Economists continue to expect slow improvement in thetrade deficit. April's deficit report, due Friday, isexpected to narrow to $7.5 billion, following March'swidening to $8.4 billion.   ---                  Closely Watched Reports                                                                                                              Statistics Released in the Week Ended June 8                                                                                                                                                          CHANGE                                              (from prior                                  TOTAL           period)                                                                                                          Money supply                                                                                                            M1 -- Week ended     May 24 (in billions)       $803.7           - $3.2                                                                                                            M2 -- Week ended     May 24 (in billions)     $3,258.6           - $7.8                                                                                                            May 24 (in billions)     $4,052.6           -$10.8                                                                                                          Auto sales   Late May, total   vs. year ago                295,620           - 5.9%                                                                                                          Consumer credit   April (in billions)         $715.83           + 0.58                                                                                                          New jobless claims   Week ended May 26           356,000           + 4.1%                                                                                                                   Statistics to be Released This Week                                                                                                          Retail sales (Wed.)
