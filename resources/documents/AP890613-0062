Clashes between police and protesters broke out at six Seoulcolleges while peaceful protests were held at six other campuses.   Riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets ringedall the colleges to stop protesters from marching into the streets.   The clashes came amid conflicting reports that Roh intends toshuffle his Cabinet and remove senior ministers he believes have notperformed effectively. About 300 protesters, some of them armed withwooden clubs and iron pipes, battled police with firebombs at SogangUniversity in western Seoul after the students marched out of thecampus beating drums and waving flags.   Hundreds of riot troopers blocked nearby streets and hurled rocksat the students but did not use tear gas. Students hurling rocksbattled riot police at nearby Yonsei University after they wereblocked from marching out.   ``Beat Roh Tae-woo to death!'' and ``Oust Roh Tae-woo!'' studentschanted.   Police said they had no reports of arrests or serious injuries.   Student leaders, speaking at campus rallies, denounced thegovernment for a crackdown in recent weeks on dissident groups anddemanded the release of scores of jailed dissident leaders.   Police carried out the crackdown to curb a recent wave of violentprotests.   The violent campus clashes were the largest in recent weeks. Someradical students said in May they would stop using firebombs afterseven riot police were killed in a demonstration.   But student groups have started to use firebombs and otherweapons again. Thousands of students battled police in runningstreet clashes in central Seoul on Saturday, and more than 1,000people were arrested.   The radicals and alllied dissident groups are calling for Roh'souster and demanding to take part in a youth festival in CommunistNorth Korea next month. The government has banned theirparticipation because of its bitter rivalry with the North.   The radicals have little public support because of their violenttactics and extremist views.   South Korean news reports today said Roh was considering removingsome Cabinet ministers who have failed to carry out their tasks orbeen linked to unpopular policies. There have been persistentreports for weeks of Cabinet changes.   The administration had no comment on the reports.   Roh announced last week he would not keep an election promise tohold a midterm referendum on his performance. He said a referendumwould generate political unrest, but some opposition groups aredemanding a vote.   Roh, a former army general, won presidential elections in late1987.</TEXT></DOC>
