Stealth bomber because Air Force officials approved the questionable charges, according to individuals familiar with the inquiry.    The individuals said government attorneys involved in the civil inquiry at the U.S. attorney's office here have sent a memorandum to their superiors in Washington complaining of being stymied by &quot;Air Force complicity&quot; and suggesting that the government find a way to prosecute certain military officials.    &quot;We aren't suggesting that any blue-suiters are about to be indicted,&quot; said one individual involved in the investigation, in a reference to military officials. &quot;But the Air Force and Northrop have had an incestuous relationship.&quot;    An Air Force spokesman for the Stealth bomber couldn't be reached.    A Northrop spokesman said the company isn't permitted by the Air Force to comment on its contract for the bomber, also known as the B-2, because of its classified status. However, the spokesman added, &quot;We have conducted an eight-month internal investigation {into employee allegations}, and we found no evidence that Northrop knowingly overcharged the government on the B-2 program.&quot;    The lack of Justice Department involvement means the private suit, which was filed earlier this year by several current and former employees seeking monetary damages for alleged misdeeds by the Los Angeles defense contractor, will probably be difficult to prove. The employees had claimed that Northrop covered up or destroyed an audit, failed to maintain a proper accounting system and had lost control of the costs of building the advanced-technology bomber, which is scheduled to be unveiled next month.    But the company's litigation travails concerning the project aren't over. Lawyers at the Justice Department's criminal division have begun looking into whether certain military employees overseeing Northrop may have conspired with certain contractor employees to cover up overcharges from their superiors, Pentagon auditors or the Congress. The bomber's growing budget has been kept under a cloak of secrecy, and members of Congress with access to budget data on the classified program have repeatedly complained that Air Force oversight was slipshod.    In the past two years, Northrop has taken $214 million in write-downs related to the program under contracts covering its research and development phase. The government share of overruns hasn't been made public. Investment analysts have said that, beginning last year, the Air Force began reimbursing Northrop for all additional research-and-development costs on the bomber. In exchange, Northrop agreed to accept a lower guaranteed profit margin, according to David Smith, a Washington aerospace consultant.    Close ties between the military and its suppliers have been cited previously as an impediment to government fraud investigations. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations panel, has derided &quot;the symbiotic relationship between the military and their contractors,&quot; and held a hearing on the subject last year. Then-Assistant Attorney General William Weld, in an appearance there, complained that &quot;military officials may overlook or ignore infractions by the contractor.&quot; He added that &quot;in the absence of fraudulent intent, the resulting overcharges may not be prosecutable or even recoverable.&quot;    The problem of tracking alleged overcharges on the Stealth bomber is considered especially acute because only a few investigators are allowed to look over the books on the program.    Former Air Force secretary Verne Orr said he foresaw the potential for abuse on the Stealth program in 1984, when he called for the bomber to be removed from the military's secret &quot;black budget&quot; and made public. &quot;It was too big to hide from the Russians in the budget,&quot; he says now of the cost of the project. But then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger overruled him, Mr. Orr says. </TEXT></DOC>
