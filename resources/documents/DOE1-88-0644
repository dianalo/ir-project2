CellP was measured with the micro-pressure probe under conditions which eliminatedtranspiration. Psychrometric measurements of water potential confirmedthe pressure-probe measurements. Following excision, P of the growingcells decreased in 1 h by an average of 1.8 bar to a mean plateau valueof 2.8 bar, and remained constant thereafter. Treatment with 10{sup -5}M indole-3-acetic acid of 10{sup -5} M fusicoccin (known growth stimulants)accelerated the rate of P relaxation, whereas various treatments whichinhibit growth slowed down or completely stopped P relaxation in apicalsegments. In contrast, P of basal (nongrowing) segments gradually increasedbecause of absorption of solutes from the cell-wall free space of thetissue. These results provide a new and rapid method for measuring theyield threshold and they show that P in intact growing pea stems exceedsthe yield threshold by about 2 bar. Wall relaxation is shown here toaffect the water potential and turgor pressure of excised growing segments.</TEXT></DOC>
