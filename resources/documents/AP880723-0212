As things stand, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. is thedominant carrier but losing market share, MCI Communications Corp.has returned to predictable profitability, and US SprintCommunications Co. is poised at a crossroads between prosperity andtrouble.   Here is what happened in a rapid-fire week for the long-distancebusiness:   _ATandamp;T blamed spiraling expenses for a 0.3 percent decrease inits second-quarter profits and announced a companywide hiringfreeze, the first since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. Itsaid it was moving 3,000 managers into sales and marketing.   _MCI reported a surprising nine-fold quarterly profit increase,setting records for both profit and revenue, less than a week afterrevealing it would buy back the 16.2 percent stake held byInternational Business Machines Corp.   _US Sprint lost another $112 million before taxes in the latestquarter, its parents said. GTE Corp. said it would reduce its staketo 19.9 percent early next year, leaving the rest in the hands ofthe smaller United Telecommunications Inc.   ``You put these events together and you really have a snapshotof the long-distance industry,'' said Eric Arnum, an analyst forInternational Resource Development Inc. in Norwalk, Conn.   ATandamp;T had 72 percent of the long-distance market last year,followed by MCI with 9.3 percent and US Sprint with 5.6 percent,according to the Yankee Group, a Boston-based consulting firm.   From here, the battle of the long-distance carriers is expectedto focus on big corporate accounts _ traditionally a stronghold forATandamp;T, but an area where the newcomers can build a track record thatcarries over to other businesses, analysts said.   The biggest question at week's end was US Sprint. If the companyfulfills its promises of profitability, GTE will look foolish forhaving backed out and United Telecommunications will have the lookof genius.   William T. Esrey, its new 48-year-old chief, is coming to workat 6 a.m. and staying into the evening. Analysts call himintelligent and committed to the goal of turning US Sprint around.   On the other hand, analysts say some corporate customers arereluctant to use US Sprint for other than secondary service becauseof questions about whether it can blot its red ink. Losses total$1.76 billion since the company was formed on July 1, 1986.   Investors seemed willing to give United Telecommunications thebenefit of the doubt. The stock ended the week at $33.25 a share,scarcely below the $33.62{ that prevailed before it announced plansto pay GTE about $600 million for 30.1 percent of US Sprint.   New York-based ATandamp;T has lately lost some of the big jobs that itonce routinely won, a sign that it is losing its aura ofinvincibility among major customers.   Washington-based MCI has nailed down contracts from MerrillLynch andamp; Co., the Social Security Administration, United Airlinesand the Defense Department, while US Sprint has gotten work fromthe state of Illinois, Westinghouse Electric Corp. and SmithKlineBeckman.   ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen's drive to hold costs down whileputting more salespeople on the road seems to be at least partly aresponse to concerns about long distance _ even though longdistance remains highly profitable for the company, covering lossesin the computer business.   One analyst compared ATandamp;T to the New York Mets: loaded withtalent, but possibly lacking in desire.   MCI, in contrast, is looking hot lately after hundreds ofmillions of dollars in losses in 1986. Its stock has doubled in thepast year; its founder, William McGowan, is back on the job after aheart transplant last year; its recent earnings report reflectsinroads into corporate accounts as well as 800 service andworldwide direct dialing, all ATandamp;T strongholds.   US Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo., has some obviousadvantages, including a high-quality, nationwide fiber network thatwill eventually cost roughly $3 billion, said Steven Reynolds, ananalyst with Link Resources in New York.   Its problems include two years of billing snafus, which it isonly now getting under control. Also, US Sprint lacks some of theexpertise in assembling networks that ATandamp;T has and MCI is quicklygaining.   US Sprint is trying to prove its mettle in that area by takingmore advantage of the expertise at Telenet, a unit that is thenation's biggest network for data transmission.   Telenet, about the only profitable part of Sprint, has prettymuch gone its own way for the past two years, a situation that USSprint's new chief vows to change.   ``I don't think we've done as good a job as we ought to there,''said Esrey, who is chief executive of United Telecommunications,and took on the added role of US Sprint chief executive when RobertSnedaker abruptly retired this past week.   Esrey predicted US Sprint would be profitable ``in thenot-too-distant future.'' But after steadily pushing back itstimetable for profitability, he has stopped naming dates.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
