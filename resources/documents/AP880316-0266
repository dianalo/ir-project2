MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soldiers tried to overthrow Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega on Wednesday but they were overpowered, andthousands of people poured into the streets in the largest protestyet of his continued rule.   Many workers are broke in a country that uses U.S. dollars asits currency but has almost none of them. Street corners in poorneighborhoods were dotted with burning barricades Wednesday.   The nation's Defense Forces said the coup attempt apparently wasled by Col. Leonidas Macias, head of the national police. He wasarrested along with three majors, a captain and some civilians, thecommunique said.   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, head of the military press office, said ``nomore than eight or nine'' officers were involved in the revolt. Hesaid there were no casualties but did not say what happened toofficers not listed among those arrested.   It was the first sign of trouble within Noriega's DefenseForces, which had kept a solid front through nine months of civilunrest caused by accusations that Noriega was involved in crimesranging from drug trafficking to political assassination. He wasindicted on drug charges in Florida.   The Panama Canal Commision, which supervises operation of the50-mile waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, saiddockworkers' strikes and an electricity shutoff had not impededship passage. The canal has its own electrical generating capacity.   But operations stopped on the Trans-Panama pipeline, whichcarries about 650,000 barrels of Alaskan crude oil a day across theisthmus for delivery to Gulf of Mexico and East Coast markets. Thepipeline relies on local power and the U.S. Embassy in Panama Citysaid the line lacked electricity to drive the pumps.   BP America Inc. and its subsidiary Sohio Oil own up tothree-quarters of the oil that flows through the line and Exxon Co.USA owns the rest, comprising about 10 percent of total U.S.production.   Washington has put pressure on Noriega, and President Reagansaid Tuesday the United States wants him ``out of there.''Sanctions such as freezing Panamanian accounts in U.S. banks andwithholding Panama Canal fees created a cash shortage that makes itimpossible to pay the 130,000 public employees.   Flaming barricades blocked hundreds of streets on the third dayof the latest public protest. By midafternoon, police and militaryunits began reappearing in the city.   Many protesters identified themselves as ``civilistas'' _members of the National Civic Crusade, a coalition of about 200business, professional, labor, student and opposition groups.   The Crusade was formed last June to lead the campaign to oustNoriega as chief of the Defense Forces, which include the militaryand police.   By midafternoon, the demonstrators were dispersed, buses andtaxis stopped running and the city was virtually deserted, withmost shops closed. Widespread looting broke out downtown, mostly byyouths.   Reporters said men in civilian clothes fired pistols and riflesat demonstrators from four-wheel-drive vehicles. Opponents haveaccused the government of using hired thugs or plainclothessecurity agents to break up protests.   Electricity went out in most of the country after workers at thestate power company joined the protests at midday. Local telephoneservice was sporadic.   Protesters chanted ``Noriega must go!'' and ``Noreiga, tyrant,your end is near!''   Residents near the Defense Forces headquarters heard the clatterof light arms fire inside the walled compound beginning at about8:15 a.m. It continued for at least half an hour.   An hour after the shooting stopped, Noriega appeared on thestairs on one side of the building, dressed in civilian clothes andaccompanied by members of his high command.   ``They were kisses,'' he said when asked about the shooting.   To questions from reporters about what had happened, he replied:``What happened is that you are visiting us here.''   A communique by the Defense Forces said ``an attempt by severalofficers to take over the headquarters of our institution wasfoiled. The attempt was an isolated action that was repressed bythe officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers of theinstitution.''   Among those arrested, the communique said, were Macias; Majs.Fernando Quezada, Aristedes Valdonedo and Jaime Benitez and Capt.Humberto Macias.   The statement said ``most of the officers involved in thisattempt were returned recently to the country after takingspecialized courses in different military installations of theUnited States, where they were influenced and compromised intobetraying the oath they had given to the Defense Forces and thefatherland.   ``Troops loyal to the commander in in chief, in a quick action,repressed and controlled the situation, thus avoiding bloodshed.''   Earlier, soldiers stopped Associated Press reporters Eloy O.Aguilar and Pauline Jelinek and photographer Diana Smith as theydrove up to the heavily guarded headquarters, forced them from thecar at gunpoint and marched them into the compound.   They saw guards lead an officer with his hands behind his headinto a barracks.   A captain told the journalists, who were later released, thatthe man was taking part ``in a simulated exercise'' of takingprisoners.   The captain would not identify himself.   Hundreds of soldiers surrounded the headquarters in one of theolder, poorer sections of Panama City. Residents were kept away.   The U.S. Southern Command put its 10,000 military personnel andtheir dependents on the highest security alert, ordering Americans``not to go into public areas except for essential business.''   Officials of the canal commission said in Washinton that roadsto the canal were blocked and the Panamanian military closed theentrance to a U.S. air base near the canal administrativeheadquarters in Balboa.   Dennis P. McAuliffe, administrator of the commission, said he``would not regard (the blockade) as a hostile act at this moment.''</TEXT></DOC>
