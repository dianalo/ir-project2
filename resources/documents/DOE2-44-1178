<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-1178 </DOCNO><TEXT>Based on a German patent (DE 2191418 C2) a vacuum-condensation dryer wasdeveloped in laboratory-scale. The target was the drying of hard coalfinest particles in a process which is characterized bei minimizing theuse of energy and working without air pollution. The results of the tests,which are received by variation of various parameters could be mathematicallydescribed and physically explained. The results correlates with testscarried out in pilot scale. The energy input by using microwaves wasalso subject of the successfully investigation. (orig.) With 63 refs.,12 tabs., 33 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
