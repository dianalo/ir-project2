ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Retailers' cash registers are beeping and ringingtheir way through the Christmas season, but many shoppers are buyingcheaper gifts than in the past.   Industry observers find that consumers with changing lifestylesare allocating more money for their homes and less for the thingsthey don't really need. That means less expensive Christmas gifts,fewer apparel purchases and, on a much broader scale, some bigchanges in the retail industry in the next few years.   It's all because of shifts in the demographic makeup of thiscountry. The baby boom generation that is entering or well intomiddle age has different interests and needs than it did just a fewyears ago.   Monroe Greenstein, a retail industry analyst with the investmentfirm Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Inc., said recently the apparel industry'syear-long sales slump _ which appears to be at an end _ was due inpart to the changes in consumer spending. It was also caused bywomen's rejection of the fashions over the past few seasons.   ``Your priorities change,'' Greenstein said. ``You're concernedless with apparel and more with what goes into your home.''   Stacy Ruclamer, of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., agreed with thathypothesis in a recent analysis. Ms. Ruclamer said the sluggishnessin overall retail spending that has persisted since February 1987was partly attributable to ``the fact that while the trendsettingteen-age population was declining ... the maturing baby boomers wereforming households and shifting their buying patterns to manyhome-related products.''   Some retailers have reported brisk business this holiday seasonin what's known as ``low-ticket'' items, such as sweaters andaccessories. The biggest sellers at Bloomingdale's in New Yorkinclude $25 watches, $64 Calvin Klein sweaters, and $40 bathrobes,and the store says it's done landmark business in handbags, beltsand scarves.   K mart Corp., the nation's largest retailer, has also reportedless expensive gifts are the most popular this season.   Overall, the Christmas season appears to be going well.   ``I think it's decent so far,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, an analystwith Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``I think most stores are close toplan although the numbers are not that robust.''   Apparel retailers, who were slashing prices a year ago at theheight of their slump, are ``doing very well,'' said Fred Wintzer,an analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons ``They're doing a lot better thanI thought they would.''   Analysts believe stores will benefit from shifts in the calendarthat add two days to the shopping season this year.   And, said Wintzer, ``They're all going to get a big salesincrease that last week'' before Christmas.   Retailers and the analysts who track them had loweredexpectations going into the Christmas shopping season because of thecontinuing sluggishness in the industry.   Consumers have been spending less in stores because of the highercost of services, such as medical care and college tuition, and ontheir cars and on food. And they've been trying to pay down highinstallment debt.   But the analysts nonetheless expect some retailers to benefitfrom the demographic changes.   Walter Loeb, of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc., predicted, ``theemphasis for specialty stores in the next decade will change fromapparel fashions to home furnishings.''   That means retailers like Home Depot and Builders Square, whichspecialize in home improvement items like paint, paneling andhardware, will be in greater demand, Loeb said. So will stores likeConrans and Pier 1 Imports, which feature home furnishings, he said.   Other retailers, like K mart, have recognized the trend and arepromoting their home-furnishing or home-improvement segments, Loebsaid.   The analysts expect to see some leveling off in apparelretailing, although, as Loeb noted, ``fashion specialists anddepartment stores with a specific point of view will continue to dowell in the 1990s.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
