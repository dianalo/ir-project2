The move should begin to answer some of the critics ofRecoll, who say that the unit has been calling loans fromborrowers who are current on their payments. Recoll's missionis to liquidate 14,000 loans, valued at $5.5 billion, that itmanages for the FDIC.</LP><TEXT>   More than $1.1 billion of Recoll-managed loans are knownas &quot;performing non-performers&quot; because they are in defaultfor technical reasons -- such as the decline in value ofcollateral securing the loan -- but borrowers have stayedcurrent on payments.   When Providence, R.I.-based Fleet took over Bank of NewEngland in July, it took on $14.5 billion of sound assetsthat remained in the failed bank and $5.5 billion remainingwith the FDIC.   Last week, Fleet said that the price for the assets to bepurchased from Recoll would be determined by current marketrates for troubled-asset purchases. Among Fleet's conditions,a bank spokesman said at the time, is that any loans thatsour -- among approximately 1,500 loans the bank is hoping tobuy -- can be returned to FDIC.</TEXT></DOC>
