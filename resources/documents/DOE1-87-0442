Within an approximate position-space renormalizationgroup framework on a square lattice we obtain the behaviour of the criticalconcentration p (sub)c and of the critical exponents {nu} and {beta}for m = 0 (ordinary percolation), 1,2 and 3. We find that the bootstrappercolation problem can be cast into different universality classes,characterized by the values of m.</TEXT></DOC>
