 Last week's analysis exploredsystems-level hardware; the week before, trends in applications software weredissected.andM;This week's story analyzes the PC Week Polls on peripheral equipment:board-level hardware, communications/backup equipment and display/outputhardware.andM;Working Together SmoothlyandM;Seven Polls were conducted on board-level hardware: PS/2-compatible memoryboards, PC-compatible memory boards, memory boards with communications ports,Enhanced Graphics Adapter/Video Graphics Array (EGA/VGA)-compatible boards,8-bit VGA boards, 16-bit VGA boards and 3270-emulation boards.andM;Despite the diversity of products, each Poll harbored an importantsimilarity: Across the board, hardware compatibility was the most importantproduct characteristic influencing the decision to purchase.andM;The accurate and smooth cohabitation of a board within its system environmentis far and away the most crucial issue to volume purchasers charged withkeeping the microcomputer-driven corporate workplace humming.andM;Equal ConcernsandM;This mission also explains buyers' equal concerns for a board's compatibilitywith software (both operating-system software and applications software) thatenables the board to operate effectively.andM;For instance, buyers of memory boards for PCs as well as for PS/2s namedsoftware compatibility and hardware compatibility as equally important.andM;The Polls on 8-bit and 16-bit VGA boards grouped hardware and softwarecompatibility together; in both cases, respondents cited that trait as tops.andM;Software compatibility was identified as the No.andP;  2 trait -- by a one-pointmargin over hardware compatibility -- by buyers of memory boards equippedwith communications ports and by those purchasing 3270-emulation boards inbulk.andM;In the case of display/output hardware, which includes laser printers, penplotters, EGA/VGA monitors and 24-pin dot-matrix printers, buyers of laserprinters and of 24-pin dot-matrix printers both reversed the order.andM;They named software compatibility as the foremost influence, assigninghardware compatibility to the second-place slot, only two points below thetop spot.andM;Something To Believe InandM;Across all the diverse products covered in this week's analysis of Polls onperipheral equipment, when reliability was not cited as the most crucialelement in a purchase decision, it was ousted from top place by no more thanthree points.andM;Even within the category of communications/backup equipment -- a catch-allgrouping that encompasses 2,400-bps modems and asynchronous communicationssoftware, as well as external tape drives and backup software -- reliabilitywas placed at or near the top of buyers' lists of must-have attributes.andM;For example, corporate purchasers of external tape drives and modems lookedfirst for reliability.andP;  Backup-software buyers placed reliability only twopoints behind all-important backup accuracy, and buyers of asynchronouscommunications software tied reliability with hardware compatibility for thetop slot.andM;Reliability is all-important when purchasing EGA/VGA monitors or penplotters, respondents to those Polls reported.andP;  Both sets of corporate buyersconsider compatibility the No.andP;  2 influence.andM;Reliability also tied for first place in influencing the purchase of PCmemory boards and EGA/VGA boards.andP;  Only one point separated top-placedhardware compatibility from second-ranked reliability in the Polls on both8-bit VGA boards and 3270-emulation boards.andM;A mere two-point difference separated first-placed compatibility andrunner-up reliability in the Polls on 16-bit VGA boards, PS/2 memory boards,memory boards with communications ports and 24-pin dot-matrix printers.andP;  Justthree points separated reliability from the attribute ranked highest bybuyers of laser printers.andM;Tight CompetitionandM;A number of PC Week Polls showed close overall scores among the surveyedbrands, suggesting that products were fairly equally matched in terms ofexcellence across the board.andM;For instance, only five points separated the four pen plotters surveyed, andsix points overall served to differentiate the seven brands of EGA/VGAgraphics boards and the five 24-pin printers surveyed.andM;Some product areas may harbor hot competition, but the results of a few PCWeek Polls on similar subjects indicate that a couple of vendors retain afirm hold on buyers' hearts.andM;In all three Polls on graphics boards -- EGA/VGA boards, as well as the 8-bitVGA and 16-bit VGA boards that were rated in Polls seven months later --Paradise Systems Inc.'s graphics products were awarded the highest overallscores by their buyers.andM;And, in the Polls on PS/2 memory boards, PC-compatible memory boards andmemory boards with communications ports, buyers gave the highest overallscore to an Intel Corp. product.andP;  In fact, in most attributes surveyed withineach of those Polls, Intel buyers awarded the highest score to their product-- with the notable exception of value relative to cost.andM;However, because that trait appears to have little influence on corporatebuyers, this low score did not unseat Intel's products from the top position.andM;Slash Downtime, Not PricesandM;Clearly, volume buyers of peripherals are looking for equipment they cancount on far more than they're looking for gear that may be easier on thecorporate purse strings.andM;An average gap of 16 points separated the scores for reliability from thosegiven to relative value, indicating an immense difference in the influenceeach trait wields on corporate buyers who select one product over another.andM;What is less obvious is why vendors bother cutting prices, when concentratingon cutting downtime instead would appear to pay off more handsomely in thelong run.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
