But forAmerica's class-action lawyers, it was a major businessopportunity.   They found clients in their own law offices and contactedtheir friends with teenage children. Their clients included16-year-old Jay Freedman, who exclaimed &quot;Gee]&quot; after hisfather suggested the lawsuit, and Jessica Pinks, ahigh-school cheerleader who didn't know she was a plaintiffuntil she read it in the newspaper. &quot;You couldn't imagine theridicule I got at school,&quot; she says.</LP><TEXT>   Before long, at least 26 suits were filed, all seekingcourt approval to become class actions, in at least sevenstates. They sought damages from Arista Records, theBertelsmann AG unit that distributed Milli Vanilli's &quot;GirlYou Know It's True&quot; album. Mr. Freedman, Miss Pinks andthousands of other young fans will get, at best, a fewdollars each from all the suits. It's doubtful that any ofthe plaintiffs spent more than $30 or so on Milli Vanillimerchandise -- and virtually all of them had stoppedlistening to their record long before the lip-synching wasrevealed.   But the lawyers involved stand to make hundreds ofthousands of dollars. And that has led to an uglyconfrontation among them, prompting one judge to declare thathe senses a &quot;strong odor&quot; from the conduct of some of theattorneys. &quot;The whole legal pretense is that these casesarose from spontaneous consumer grievances,&quot; says Walter K.Olson, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who haswritten a book on the proliferation of lawsuits. But in fact,he says, &quot;the lawyers are doing what they accuse the recordcompany of doing: Getting people to lip-synch for them.&quot;   William C. MacLeod, a former director of the Federal TradeCommission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, agrees. &quot;It'shard to imagine there's a crying consumer need for redress ofinjuries here,&quot; he says. &quot;While all the Milli Vanillis arecrowding the court dockets, cases involving very seriousinjuries or people driven near bankruptcy are sitting andwaiting.&quot;   Milli Vanilli was the stage name for two young performers,Robert &quot;Rob&quot; Pilatus and Fabrice &quot;Fab&quot; Morvan, who had comeout of nowhere, released their hit album and won the 1990Grammy Award for best new artist. Last year, when they wererevealed to be lip-synching front men for a clever recordproducer, the revelation was greeted more with derision thanoutrage. The men were stripped of their Grammy. U.S. Recordsales weren't affected because the album had long since beenoff the charts anyway.   But the lawsuits flew, most alleging violations of avariety of state consumer statutes and contract laws and somecharging that Rob and Fab were part of an enterprise thatviolated the federal Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations (RICO) act.   The country's top class-action lawyers and law firms gotinvolved, such as William S. Lerach of Milberg, Weiss,Specthrie, Bershad andamp; Lerach of San Diego. Mr. Lerach's firmfiled a Milli Vanilli suit in state court in San Diego,listing as cocounsel the nation's other leading class-actionlaw firm, Greenfield andamp; Chimicles of Hanover, Pa. That firmalso filed a virtually identical suit in federal court in LosAngeles, later adding Mr. Lerach's firm and others. BothMilberg Weiss and Greenfield andamp; Chimicles are probably bestknown for filing shareholder suits against companies involvedin leveraged buy-outs and other deals.   David Stalder of Oakland, Calif., who's now 15, remembersbeing &quot;pretty angry&quot; when he heard about the lip-synching,since his mother had given him a Milli Vanilli cassette ayear earlier. That night at dinner, his mother and herattorney boyfriend &quot;suggested a lawsuit,&quot; David says in aninterview. The following evening, two other lawyers -- familyfriends -- came over and drafted court papers that were filedin state court in Alameda County, Calif., by three BayArea-based law firms.   Albert Meyerhoff, the attorney boyfriend, says: &quot;Iremember telling David he had legal rights and could exercisethem.&quot;   In the San Diego state court case, which has since beentransferred to Los Angeles, all three of the original namedplaintiffs have ties to the Lerach firm: Danielle Jeffrey isthe 10-year-old daughter of a lawyer at the firm, Linda J.Starr is a former word-processing supervisor there, and CarlaJ. Freudenburg is a former law school classmate of anotherattorney there. The Starr and Freudenburg names also appearon the federal case, along with Leo Senay Jr., now thehusband of one of the law firm's copy clerks, and LisaKelton, a former law school classmate of a Greenfield andamp;Chimicles attorney.   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, attorneys at anotherclass-action law firm, Cohen, Shapiro, Polisher, Shiekman andCohen, called two friends with teen-agers and asked themduring the conversations if they had bought any Milli Vanillirecordings. &quot;I said my son had the tape. Just one thing ledto another where we ought to do something about it, see whatwe can do,&quot; Dennis Freedman, of Erdenheim, Pa., told Aristalawyers in a deposition. They asked whether Mr. Freedmantalked to his son about the possibility of bringing the suitafter his conversation with the lawyer.   &quot;Yes,&quot; Mr. Freedman said.   &quot;What did your son say?&quot; Arista's attorneys asked.   &quot; `Really? Gee]'&quot; Mr. Freedman answered, adding that hisson was &quot;in agreement&quot; when told that Milli Vanilli might besued.   In most states, the rules governing attorneys bar directsolicitation of clients for particular suits unless theperson solicited is a relative or an existing client. Theserules apply to class actions as well as to individual suits,although once the class action is approved, additionalpotential plaintiffs must be notified of the existence of theclass.   A lawyer at Cohen Shapiro says there was nothing wrongbecause the case came up innocently in the course of informalconversations among friends; in one case, the lawyer says,the youth, after being told about the case, asked if he couldget involved.   Of the 49 named plaintiffs in the Milli Vanilli cases, atleast 41 appear to have had pre-existing relationships tolawyers, most of whom worked at firms specializing inclass-action cases. And many of the plaintiffs say theyagreed to file suit at the suggestion of a lawyer.   The case of Miss Pinks, a 16-year-old from Port Clinton,Ohio, is one example. At a Christmas party in 1989, MissPinks won a gift certificate that she redeemed for a &quot;GirlYou Know It's True&quot; cassette. Miss Pinks wasn't a big MilliVanilli fan and the tape wasn't her favorite. &quot;I didn't keepup with them,&quot; she says.   So how did her name wind up on a lawsuit? &quot;It wasn't myidea at all,&quot; Miss Pinks says. She was out of town when alawyer friend got in touch with her father and the two menagreed to file papers. Returning a few days later, Miss Pinkssays she was shocked to see her name in the Port ClintonNews-Herald. &quot;It was awful,&quot; Miss Pinks says. &quot;I'd walk intoa classroom and they'd have the cassette playing, and they'dlaugh at me.&quot;   Her lawyer, John A. Pietrykowski of Toledo, says theattorney-client privilege prevents him from discussing theorigins of the lawsuit.   Mr. Lerach of Milberg Weiss says that in the days afterthe Milli Vanilli fuss arose, &quot;the phone rang off the hookwith people wanting to sue.&quot; He denies that his firm stirredup litigation or recruited anyone. When asked why theoriginal named plaintiffs in the case brought by his firm hadsome pre-existing association with it, he replies: &quot;We couldadd another hundred names easily. But for what purpose? Sothat Arista could take their depositions? Because they paid$12 for a bogus CD? Please, excuse me]&quot;   All of the Milli Vanilli cases were brought as classactions on a contingency-fee basis, which means that thenamed plaintiffs pay nothing up front to their lawyers, whothen petition the court for their fees. If a judge approves aclass action, all buyers of Milli Vanilli records andmerchandise would be entitled to be included as plaintiffs.In recent years, judges in consumer fraud class-action caseshave allowed attorneys to recover as much as a third of anaward.   There's one big problem for law firms involved innationwide class-action cases. Say one suit is filed inCalifornia state court and another in Ohio. If the judge inOhio certifies that case as a class-action first, thendefendants can argue that the Ohio judgment binds everyone.Such a ruling would preclude recovery in the California case-- and could mean the California lawyers make no money.   That's why plaintiffs' lawyers often cooperate with eachother in class actions against large companies. When thedecision is finally made, all of the lawyers may get a pieceof the pie.   But four Chicago law firms involved in the Milli Vanillicase upset the usual arrangement. They negotiated separatelywith Arista for a proposed nationwide settlement, draftingterms that would provide partial rebates to consumers -- andnothing to other attorneys.   Under the agreement, Milli Vanilli fans would be eligiblefor rebates of $3 for each compact disk, $2 for each cassetteand $1 for each single. Concert-goers and buyers of MilliVanilli merchandise could ask Arista to donate 5% of thepurchase price to one of three charities in their names.   Arista estimates that if everyone participates, thesettlement could cost it $20 million. That's about 10% ofwhat some plaintiffs' attorneys estimate the group generatedin total revenue. The four plaintiffs' attorneys would split$675,000.   In July, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Thomas J. O'Brienheld a hearing on the tentative settlement. Lawyers who wouldbe shut out of fees if the agreement was approved showed upto protest. Nineteen attorneys jammed into the Chicagocourtroom-so many that they couldn't all stand in front ofthe bench. Judge O'Brien asked some to sit in the gallery.   The lawyers who weren't party to the settlement asked thatthe deal be set aside in part because it didn't offer fullrefunds. Judge O'Brien, however, sensed other motives. &quot;I'm acynic with some justification,&quot; he said at the hearing,during which he declined to let the Lerach group and theother challengers intervene. &quot;And in my opinion, what'sinvolved here, undisguised or disguised, is a strong odor ofconcern to control the case and insure attorneys' fees.&quot;   The excluded attorneys are angry. &quot;The level ofcompensation {for the record buyers} is just inadequate toaddress the problem,&quot; says Mark Rifkin, an attorney atGreenfield andamp; Chimicles. &quot;Some clients that I represent havesaid that they're embarrassed now to play the music. It wasnot a victimless prank.&quot;   Mr. Lerach vows he'll &quot;fight forever&quot; against the proposedsettlement. He argues that Arista should be made to disgorgeall Milli Vanilli proceeds, &quot;even if they can't bedistributed&quot; to his clients. (If, as Mr. Lerach figures,Milli Vanilli made as much as $200 million, the lawyers'share could be many millions.)   That's the only way to deter future wrongdoers, he says.&quot;At this point, I'm not motivated at all by fees, not atall,&quot; Mr. Lerach says. &quot;I'm motivated by the fact that Ithink consumers have been run roughshod over. To have it turnout that this wildly successful group was just a sham, justimpostors, and have nothing done about it countenances deceitand the worst kind of business ethics.&quot;   Mr. Lerach accuses Arista of &quot;cherrypicking&quot; to &quot;find theweakest, hungriest, plaintiffs' lawyers, and present themwith an opportunity to make a huge legal fee in return forentering into a nationwide settlement.&quot;   But Larry D. Drury, a Chicago lawyer who participated inthe settlement talks, says, &quot;If they were the ones with theexact same settlement approved, they'd be telling you howgreat it was. I don't think it's any great secret that they'dlike to get compensated. But you don't get compensated if youdon't win.&quot;   The Lerach group plans to object to the settlement inJanuary, when it's scheduled to go back before Judge O'Brienfor final approval.   Arista says the proposed settlement is fair. &quot;When youconsider that seven million copies of the album were sold inthe U.S., you have to wonder how upset people really were,&quot;says Trish Heimers, a spokeswoman for Bertelsmann MusicGroup, Arista's New York-based parent, adding that the recordcompany received &quot;fewer than 100&quot; letters of complaint.   Moreover, the record company says, Milli Vanilli fans gotwhat they paid for, and, in most cases, didn't really careabout the identity of the singers when they made thepurchases. &quot;These people didn't know Rob and Fab from Fab andTide,&quot; says Irving Scher, a New York attorney for Arista.   Some of the plaintiffs, however, say they were genuinelyupset when they heard about the lip-synching. &quot;I felt theydeceived me and my children, and others all over the world,&quot;says Carol Gaines, a cashier at a Wal-Mart store in BatonRouge, La. &quot;I didn't appreciate being lied to. We paid ourmoney and thought they were performing.&quot; Mrs. Gaines says shewas so angry that, a few days later, she picked a lawyer'snumber out of the phone book -- she reached Syed A. Salat ofBaton Rouge -- to ask what she could do.   The record company's Miss Heimers won't say how much allthe litigation has cost the firm, but estimates that 25lawyers have spent 10,000 hours on the cases so far, anexpenditure that legal experts say could already be close to$2 million.   Marc Galanter, a professor at the University of Wisconsinat Madison School of Law, calls cases such as the MilliVanilli suit &quot;indicative of the degradation of the very goodidea that was the class action.&quot; Some consumer class actionshelp combat fraud and effectively reimburse people whosuffered genuine harm. But Prof. Galanter and others citedifferent kinds of cases, such as a suit filed -- and laterdismissed -- in federal court last year by purchasers ofCoors beer who claimed they were damaged because Adolf Coorsandamp; Co. had touted &quot;Rocky Mountain spring water,&quot; when, theyallege, the company was really using &quot;ordinary water.&quot;   Mr. Lerach defends the merits of his Milli Vanilli casesby citing statutes that provide for punitive damages againstcompanies that intentionally mislabel products, especiallyone of the most consumerfriendly laws, California's ConsumersLegal Remedies Act. &quot;The California legislature gave peoplethe right to get their money back,&quot; says Mr. Lerach. &quot;Ididn't make that law.&quot;   But the man who did write the law, while serving as chiefcounsel to the state assembly's Judiciary Committee in 1971,has a different view. &quot;I will say categorically that wedidn't have this kind of case in mind,&quot; says James S. Reed.&quot;We had in mind a lot more egregious kind of advertising,such as real misrepresentation of the quality and value of aproduct.&quot;   Adds Mr. Reed: &quot;My kids played Milli Vanilli a few times.They think this whole thing's a joke.&quot;   Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan themselves, meantime, haveabandoned the Milli Vanilli name and are working in London ontheir next album, for which they plan to do their ownsinging. &quot;These lawsuits hurt us very much. It took us a longtime to get back up on our own feet,&quot; says Mr. Pilatus.Through a spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
