Foreign forces are likely to begin withdrawing from southernAfrica and Soviet troops should be about to conclude their scheduleddeparture from Afghanistan.   These are good portents for Bush but history shows how ephemeralpeaceful interludes can be. Just ask Jimmy Carter.   It was just 10 years ago _ in December 1978 _ that Carter couldlook out at the world with an air of confidence, able to boast threeforeign policy breakthroughs that won him widespread, albeittemporary, admiration.   Over a period of a few months, Carter successfully guided thePanama Canal treaties past a skeptical Senate, reached agreementwith China on the establishment of diplomatic relations and _ hismost shining achievement _ spurred the Camp David breakthroughbetween Egypt and Israel.   At the end of 1978, Carter's standing in the polls had risen to50 per cent, high by standards of the time, and he seemed destinedfor a second term in the White House.   Then came 1979, a year which ranks among the most disastrousendured by any president. The year began with the ouster of thepro-Western monarchy in Iran and its replacement by an avowedlyanti-American Islamic fundamentalist regime. It ended with theseizure of American hostages in Tehran and their detention for 444days.   Indeed, the takeover of the American embassy there was part of apattern of anti-American turmoil in Islamic countries in the fall of1979. In the space of one month, the U.S. embassies in Iran, Libyaand Pakistan were attacked by mobs.   Before the year was out, the Soviet Union had invadedAfghanistan, starting a downward spiral in superpower relations thatwasn't reversed for years.   The invasion induced Carter to slap a grain embargo on theSoviets, to withdraw from the 1980 summer Olympics in Moscow and toshelve the SALT II treaty, which had been the centerpiece of a Junesummit meeting between Carter and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev.   It seemed a new development buffeted the Carter administrationevery month. Vietnamese troops occupied neighboring Cambodia.Leftists took control in Nicaragua, paving the way for perhaps themost divisive foreign policy issue of the Reagan presidency: U.S.backing for the Nicaraguan Contras.   Almost unnoticed at the time of the Soviet invasion ofAfghanistan was the collapse of a coalition government in ElSalvador, which in turn laid the groundwork for a civil war thatclaimed the lives of an average of 800 civilians a month in 1980.   On the domestic front, the news for Carter was no better. Byyear's end, inflation reached 12 per cent, the result in largemeasure of a hefty midyear price increase decreed by the oil exportcartel.   There also was the widespread perception that Carter lookedfoolish when his subordinates claimed to have ``discovered'' in thelate summer of 1979 the presence of a Soviet brigade in Cuba, onlyto concede later that the brigade had been there for years.   Carter's showing in the polls dipped to 32 per cent in Octoberafter the brigade fiasco, reviving somewhat by year's end because ofinitial public support for his handling of the hostage crisis.   But restiveness within the Democratic party over Carter'sperformance was such that Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., decided inNovember 1979 to challenge him for the party's 1980 presidentialnomination. Carter survived that challenge but lost 44 states in hisre-election bid. He never recovered from the 1979 debacle.   In contrast to that dismal era, the world nowadays seemsdownright tame. Being president seems easier than it did in 1979. Orwas Ronald Reagan just more fortunate than his hard-luck predecessor?</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for TheAssociated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
