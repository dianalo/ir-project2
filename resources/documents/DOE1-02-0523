Examplesdrawn from the upper and lower shale members of the Bakken Formation,Williston basin, North Dakota, and the Woodford Shale, Anadarko basin,Oklahoma, demonstrate the utility of formation resistivity as a directin-situ indicator of oil generation in black shales. With the onset ofoil generation, nonconductive hydrocarbons begin to replace conductivepore water, and the resistivity of a given black-shale interval increasesfrom low levels associated with thermal immaturity to values approachinginfinity. Crossplots of a thermal-maturity index (R{sub 0} or TTI) versusformation resistivity define two populations representing immature shalesand shales that have generated oil. A resistivity of 35 ohm-m marks theboundary between immature and mature source rocks for each of the threeshales studied. Thermal maturity-resistivity crossplots make possiblea straightforward determination of thermal maturity at the onset of oilgeneration, and are sufficiently precise to detect subtle differencesin source-rock properties. For example, the threshold of oil generationin the upper Bakken shale occurs at R{sub 0} = 0.43-0.45% (TTI = 10-12).The threshold increases to R{sub 0} = 0.48-0.51% (TTI = 20-26) in thelower Bakken shale, and to R{sub 0} = 0.56-0.57% (TTI = 33-48) in themost resistive Woodford interval.</TEXT></DOC>
