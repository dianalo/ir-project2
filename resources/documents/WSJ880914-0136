They foresee a slowdown in plant construction and possibly a greater Japanese emphasis on coal or liquefied natural gas as fuels for electric power generation.    But the nuclear power development program, which a U.S. government offical here calls &quot;the most active in the free world&quot; now that France's massive nuclear power program is nearly complete, will probably remain at the center of Japan's energy policy, the official said.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), Japan's chief governmental trade and industrial policy-making body, says the importance of nuclear power stems from Japan's projected energy consumption patterns.    MITI projects that between 1986 and 2000 energy consumption by the industrial sector will grow by 7%. But household-service energy demand, which includes service and white-collar industries, is expected to rise 43% during that period.    The household sector depends largely on electric power, and the source of that power is a big worry for the government and for Japan's nine utility companies.    Toyoaki Ikuta, president of the Institute of Energy Economics and a former MITI official, says the government has been developing a three-tier program for electric power generation. Nuclear power is projected as the baseload supply for the program, he says.    Coal and LNG-fired plants will be used for midload capacity, particularly in urban areas where demand is heavier, Mr. Ikuta says, while oil-fired plants will be reserved for peak demand.    In 1986, nuclear power accounted for only 16% of the 158,268 megawatts of electric power generation, while oil and LNG accounted for 36%. By the year 2,000, nuclear power is expected to account for 25% of overall generation, compared with oil and LNG's 21%, according to the plan.    MITI, in cooperation with the utilities, has set a goal of generating 53,000 megawatts a year of electric power by nuclear power plants by the year 2000. In 1987, 27,881 megawatts were generated by nuclear capacity.    A spokesman for the Petroleum Association of Japan, an oil industry energy forum, says &quot;the Japanese government has a clear energy policy: (to) decrease its oil dependence as much as possible.&quot; LNG and coal, the association says, are preferred to oil because of their more diverse and politically stable supply sources.    The country's 36 working nuclear plants currently are running at close to 80% of capacity, or about as high as possible on an average basis, MITI figures show.    According to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the world's largest private electric power company, 25 additional 1000-megawatt nuclear plants will have to be constructed over the next 12 years to meet the 53,000-megawatt goal.    About 300 companies are involved in plant construction, with Hitachi Plant Engineering andamp; Construction Co. and Toshiba Engineering andamp; Construction Co. leading most of the construction, according to Kazuo Koizumi, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric.    There aren't any doubts that Japan is capable of raising its nuclear power capacity by such a large amount in just 12 years. But grassroots protest against nuclear power is complicating the utilities' construction plans.    On a national level, the anti-nuclear stance hasn't been considered much of a threat to construction. Utilites are heavy contributors to the coffers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which has a pro-nuclear policy.    Power company interests also indirectly influence the opposition Socialist Party, who count the pro-nuclear utility workers' unions as big contributors. Because of these contributions, the Socialist Party's official stance of opposition to nuclear power is often muted in debate in Japan's parliament, the Diet, politicians say.    &quot;Officially we're opposed&quot; to nuclear power, says Mariko Mitsui, a Socialist Diet member. &quot;But (some members) say things in the Diet that could be construed as supportive&quot; to nuclear power, she adds.    Recent anti-nuclear protests were small and organized on an informal local basis. Put together, their numbers are larger than the small groups might suggest, however. Earlier this year, several groups gathered in Tokyo and made what anti-nuclear activists claim was a 10,000-man chain that attempted to surround MITI headquarters.    Without a single, centrally organized anti-nuclear group to address, both MITI and the utilities have had unexpected difficulty reaching the necessary consensus between utilities and local anti-nuclear groups ahead of initial construction of nuclear pants to avoid costly entanglements once the project is under way.    &quot;The problem is, there isn't any mainstream&quot; to the (protest) groups, says Eiji Sakuta, director of MITI's electric power development division. &quot;Nowadays there are so many kinds of groups,&quot; he adds.    Already, negotiations prior to nuclear plant construction take longer than they used to, officials say. In August, a joint government-private sector consortium in Aomori prefecture delayed its construction schedule for an advanced thermal reactor by one year, due to refusal by local landowners to sell property to the group.    The greatest worry Japanese nuclear industry planners have is that anti-nuclear activists will continue to resist the plants after construction begins. Such protests in the U.S., which often included costly legal challenges, were one reason that nuclear power there lost their cost-attractiveness.    Mr. Ikuta says Japan's atomic program may face the same fate. &quot;I believe this could be a serious problem in the future,&quot; he says. &quot;The anti-nuclear movement is getting big.&quot;    According to MITI's Mr. Sakuta, there's already a test case, at the first nuclear plant on the northern island of Hokkaido, called Tomari.    Already built, and with fuel in the reactor despite a large-scale protest, the first of Tomari's two reactors is scheduled to begin operation in October. But a group of 1,000 opponents filed suit last week demanding that the plant's operator, Hokkaido Electric Power Co., suspend work. </TEXT></DOC>
