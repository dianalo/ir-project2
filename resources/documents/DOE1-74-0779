<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-74-0779 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is proposed for the direct analysis of species evolved from metallurgicalsamples that involves extrapolation of a function describing the evolutionrate of the analyte. The second surface atomizer was employed to determinethe time-dependent vaporization rate of an analyte from an individualsample over several heating cycles. These data were fit by using a first-orderkinetic expression and were related to the total amount of analyte inthe sample by using a calibration curve constructed with simple, aqueousstandards. Results are shown for the determination of Pb in Sn, Cu, andsteel.</TEXT></DOC>
