The group, Coniston Partners, filed a countersuit Tuesday toGillette's April 14 federal court suit seeking to block Conistonfrom soliciting shareholder votes for the board election atThursday's annual meeting.   The countersuit, the latest in a series of skirmishes betweenConiston and the personal care products giant, alleged thatGillette presented misleading and false statements in material sentto its nearly 27,000 shareholders and run in newspapers urgingrejection of Coniston's takeover attempt.   Victor Lewkow, one of Coniston's attorneys, cited Gillette'sindication that Coniston was interested in a ``greenmail'' paymentto abandon its bid and a chart in Tuesday's Wall Street Journalshowing that Swiss tycoon Tito Tettamanti heads Coniston's``tangled web'' of corporations.   ``It just isn't true,'' said Lewkow. ``You can put anyone on topof a chart showing someone is in charge.''   Lewkow said the countersuit sought unspecified relief anddismissal of Gillette's lawsuit. The action does not try to blockthe annual meeting, said Lewkow.   In its lawsuit, Gillette claimed Coniston violated federal lawsby issuing material that did not fully outline all partners andinvestors affiliated with the takeover attempt.   Voting results are not expected for at least a week followingthe meeting. Gillette said its suit should not delay the meeting.   The Gillette suit names as defendants Coniston principalsAugustus K. Oliver, Paul E. Tierney Jr. and Keith R. Gollust, inaddition to Tettamanti and several other firms holding large blocksof Gillette stock.   On Tuesday, Judge Rya Zobel ordered an April 29 pre-trialhearing for both suits.   Coniston's bid received a boost Monday when the CaliforniaPublic Employees Retirement Fund, the fifth-largest Gilletteshareholder with about 1.5 million shares, announced it would votefor the Coniston candidates.   The two Coniston partnerships have accumulated 6.76 millionGillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's sharesoutstanding.   In several letters to shareholders since March, GilletteChairman and Chief Executive Officer Colman Mockler Jr. claimedConiston planned to sell or dismember the Boston-based company.   Coniston states it can boost company profitability and stockprices at Gillette, which paid nearly $580 million in late 1986 tohalt Revlon Group Inc.'s repeated takeover attempts.   Gillette laid off nearly 2,400 workers and sold severalunprofitable divisions during a restructuring after Revlon signed a10-year agreement not to seek control of the company.</TEXT></DOC>
