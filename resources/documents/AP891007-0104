TROTT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PORTSMOUTH, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Prudence Island School probably hasthe fastest and most orderly fire drills in Rhode Island, if notthe world. And why not _ a 6-year-old and two 5-year-olds make upthe entire student body.   Shannon Cubellis and Daniel Jenness, both 5-year-oldkindergartners, and first-grader Ethel Flynn, 6, quickly lined upand marched behind teacher Elizabeth Hambly when the fire alarmbuzzed on a recent day.   They congregated calmly at the end of the school's drivewayuntil it was time to return to class.   Ethel was the first one to school that day, bounding in sevenminutes before class started at 9 a.m. As the first, she got toring the school's bell, tugging on the rope 13 times.   The girl beamed when Hambly admired her denim dress and purplesweater.   ``You look beautiful,'' the teacher said.   The 93-year-old school on the island, linked to Portsmouth byferry, was closed six years ago because there weren't enoughstudents. The island's older children take the 30-minute ferry rideinto Portsmouth to attend middle and high schools, but parents ofelementary-level children opted to teach them at home rather thanput them on the ferry at such tender ages.   Portsmouth School Superintendent Mario Mancieri said parentsfinally persuaded him to reopen the school about a month ago.   ``My first reaction was, `We have a ferry service. Availyourself of that,''' he said. ``Then we started talking about youngchildren. Someone asked me, `How would you like to put a 5-year-oldon a ferry every morning?' I started thinking about that.''   Hambly, 27, drives five miles from her home in Portsmouth tocatch the ferry in Bristol each school day.   Once off the boat, Hambly hops into a car provided by the schooldepartment. She drives about a mile down a narrow, winding roadlined with old cars and quaint cottages and summer homes to theschoolhouse.   Prudence Island, with a permanent population of about 200, ispart of the town of Portsmouth.   Mancieri said he realized the money that would be spent totransport younger children from the island to Portsmouth could beused to reopen the schoolhouse.   He said it would have cost the school district about $35,000 ayear to ship the three students to the mainland on special,$300-a-trip ferry runs not on the boat's normal schedule.   Instead, the Portsmouth School Department spent between $20,000and $30,000 to make over the island's school building, includingasbestos removal, smoke alarms and new paint.   Shannon and Daniel, the kindergartners, get out of school at12:30 p.m., while Ethel remains until 3:30 p.m. She doesn't seem tomind that the boys are free to go home early and play.   ``After they leave I have some lunch and then I do some of mywork,'' she said.   Hambly said her school would get at least one more student intwo years, but until then, unless someone moves to the island witha youngster, it's just going to be the four of them. And to makesure the students don't miss out on making friends, there'll beperiodic visits to other schools.   ``Other teachers couldn't get to know their students as well asI'm going to get to know these three,'' Hambly said. ``There's moreone-to-one teaching and learning.''   Hambly, after only a month on the job, has three loyal fans inher students.   Shannon wants to be a telephone repairman when he grows up andDaniel wants to be a fireman. Daniel would have to move off theisland because firefighters here are volunteers and he wants tomake money.   Ethel said she wants to be a teacher.   ``Just like Ms. Hambly,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
