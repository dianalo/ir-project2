Kansas City's biggest trash hauler, Deffenbaugh IndustriesInc., is scheduled to go on trial today on charges ofextortion and bid-rigging in connection with a University ofKansas Medical Center trash-collection job. The charges grewout of a major federal investigation of the hauling businesshere, an inquiry that also covers the activities of thenation's two biggest garbage companies, Waste Management Inc.and Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.</LP><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors will seek to illuminate just how trashhaulers keep prices artificially high by discouragingcompetition. The alleged price gouging in the garbagebusiness can range from a small percentage over competitiveprices to a doubling or more.   Typically, federal investigations begin after smallerhaulers complain bigger competitors are trying to run themout of business, or when customers complain of being gouged.But the catalyst in this case apparently was a WasteManagement saleswoman, Diane Cone, 33 years old, a formerwaitress for 10 years at a Denny's Restaurant. Ms. Cone'scharges triggered the federal probe that led to theindictment of Deffenbaugh last January on charges ofbid-rigging and extortion.   While waitressing, Ms. Cone often dreamed of a careerchange. The mother of three landed a sales job at WasteManagement after a group of her regulars, local trashhaulers, told her she'd be great in sales. &quot;I was so proud,&quot;she says.   But her pride soon turned to frustration and fear. Sheasserted in a lawsuit filed in Missouri state court here thatshe believed the giant company was engaged in price fixing.Her attempt to blow the whistle on the alleged scheme led toher being fired, she says in the suit. Waste Managementsettled her wrongful dismissal suit last month by agreeing topay Ms. Cone a sum of money it won't disclose. In return, shehad to tell Waste Management lawyers what she'd told thegovernment so the company could better gauge its exposure tothe probe, according to a Waste Management lawyer.   Both Waste Management, based in Oak Brook, Ill., andBrowning-Ferris, based in Houston, deny they're involved inprice fixing in Kansas City or elsewhere. Anthony V. Nanni,the Justice Department antitrust division official headingthe three-year-old probe, will say only that &quot;theinvestigation is continuing.&quot;   Price-fixing charges against Waste Management date back toits days as Ace Scavenger Service. Ace and dozens of otherhaulers belonged to a local industry group, Chicago andamp;Suburban Refuse Disposal Corp., whose very rules were ahow-to guide on price fixing, Illinois officials charged in acivil suit filed in state court in suburban Chicago. From asearly as 1965 until the state sued in 1971, customers weretreated like the captives of the haulers, the state charged,resulting in &quot;unreasonably high&quot; prices for garbage removal.   According to the suit, member scavengers, as the groupcalled its own, agreed on the following measures: They wouldnot solicit each other's customers; if a customer of onehauler sought a bid from another hauler, the second haulerwould either refuse to bid or quote a higher price; if ahauler nevertheless ended up with another hauler's customer,something of equal value -- money or a comparable account --would be paid to even the score; and bidding on allgovernment contracts would be rigged ahead of time.   The group settled the suit for a combined $50,000, withoutadmitting wrongdoing. The practice of divvying up customersand fixing prices continued around the country. From 1973 to1989, Waste Management was convicted or pleaded guilty or nocontest to criminal price-fixing charges in Wisconsin,Georgia, Ohio, Florida and Southern California. The companypaid fines of more than $4 million.   Browning-Ferris pleaded guilty in the Ohio case. It alsopaid $6 million to a Vermont hauler who charged in a civilsuit filed in federal court in Vermont that Browning-Ferristried to run him out of business. &quot;Squish him like a bug,&quot; aBrowning-Ferris official allegedly ordered underlings,according to testimony in the case by Richard Rudolph, aformer Browning-Ferris salesman.   The penalties, though, were minuscule compared to theprofits the two haulers were ringing up on their growingbusiness. Waste Management posted net income of $372.6million, or 76 cents a share, on revenue of $3.63 billion forthe first half. Browning-Ferris, for the nine months endedJune 30, had profit of $177.1 million, or $1.15 a share, onrevenue of $2.37 billion.   &quot;Rather than concluding that crime does not pay . . .Browning-Ferris and Waste Management have continued toviolate state and federal laws indiscriminately throughoutthe country, to pay the comparatively modest fines imposed bythe courts, and to reap the immense profits which flowed fromthese illegal activities,&quot; lawyers asserted in a recentclass-action case alleging a national conspiracy by the twocompanies to fix certain prices.   Waste Management and Browning-Ferris deny that assertionand the existence of any national conspiracy. To settle thatsuit, which was brought on behalf of customers in federalcourt in Philadelphia, they paid $19.5 million and $30.5million, respectively. A loss of a jury trial, with treblingof damages under antitrust law, could have resulted in a $1billion decision against them, says William D. Ruckelshaus,Browning-Ferris chairman and chief executive officer. Adds aWaste Management lawyer, John Noel: &quot;We were buying totalpeace.&quot;   For her part, Ms. Cone says she'd never heard of pricefixing when she joined Waste Management. As a novicesaleswoman, her job was in large part to drive around andeither spot new businesses that didn't have garbage service,or to sell Waste Management's service to businesses usinganother hauler.   Waste Management had two price lists in Kansas City -- onefor new businesses and another, about 35% higher, forbusinesses that already had trash service. The alleged schemewas this: Ms. Cone says she nearly always had to stick to thehigher prices when bidding against the two main competitors,Browning-Ferris and Deffenbaugh.   In a deposition, she says her sales manager, LindaEpstein, explained: &quot;We want to keep them happy. . . . Wewant to get the prices up in Kansas City.&quot;   The effort at times went to ridiculous extremes, suggestdepositions taken before Ms. Cone's suit was settled. WhenSandra Blackman, another Waste Management saleswoman, foundout that Browning-Ferris was raising its price to a bigcustomer, Torotel Inc., she asked Ms. Epstein for a bidprice. &quot;I was told to double -- double the 35%,&quot; Mrs.Blackman says in a deposition. &quot;It was almost laughable tocall the people back.&quot;   Sherry Green, assistant purchasing manager at Torotel, anelectronics component maker, recalls the Browning-Ferrisprice increase. &quot;I thought BFI was high,&quot; she says in atelephone interview. But when she asked six or seven otherhaulers for competing bids, they all came in even higher, shesays.   After Ms. Epstein told her about the national class actionprice-fixing suit against Waste Management andBrowning-Ferris, Ms. Cone feared she might be breaking thelaw. &quot;I was afraid I might be charged with something,&quot; shesays.   On Dec. 8, 1987, she gave Waste Management's generalmanager here, Joseph McMurtrey, a letter saying she didn'twant to be involved in the alleged price fixing. That sameday, according to a memo from Mr. McMurtrey, the office fileswere locked up and access to them restricted. The next month,Ms. Cone was fired, she says. The day she left, Mrs. Blackmansays in her deposition, a document shredder showed up.   Waste Management officials contend Ms. Cone was laid off,not fired, but also say she was a problem employee just thesame. She wasn't any good at passing price increases on tocustomers, and around the office she rambled, Mr. McMurtreysays in a deposition. The arrival of the shredder was acoincidence, the company maintains. Lawyers for Ms. Epsteinand Mr. McMurtrey also deny Ms. Cone's charges.   Deffenbaugh and its owner, Ronald D. Deffenbaugh, wereindicted by a federal grand jury in January. The indictmentalleges an incredible gouging.   A Deffenbaugh subsidiary already had the University ofKansas Medical Center hauling contract for about $100,000 ayear, according to the indictment, and in late 1985 thehauler refused to renew the contract. The work was put out tobid and, the government charges, Deffenbaugh rigged thebidding with other haulers so that it would be the lowestqualified bidder at $303,360.   But another bidder, not in the conspiracy, A.C. HaulingInc., came in and made a competitive bid of $124,932. Anangry Mr. Deffenbaugh threatened to take away all A.C.Hauling's customers, the government charges, unless thesmaller hauler withdrew its Medical Center bid. A.C.withdrew, leaving Deffenbaugh the winner.   Richard Rhyne, a lawyer for Deffenbaugh, denies thecharges and declines to elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
