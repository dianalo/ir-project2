Thenodes were located within a group (pre- and paracaval, interaortico-caval,pre- and paraaortic) which was removed during primary lymphadenectomyfor non-seminomatous testicular tumor. Most nodes were fairly roundedwith a variety range less than 20%. There was no difference between thelargest node in a metastasis group (variety range less than 20% in 29out of 36) and tumor free nodes (variety range less than 20% in 39 outof 50). A rounded shape of lymph nodes measuring less than 20 mm on transverseCT sections was not a reliable sign of metastasis in patients with non-seminomatoustesticular tumor.</TEXT></DOC>
