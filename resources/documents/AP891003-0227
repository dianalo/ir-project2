A sale would leave Texas Oil with its biggest business _ gasgathering _ still intact, but would eliminate a business that oneanalyst said was draining the subsidiary.   ``I estimate that TXO's producing properties are losing $30million to $40 million per year on an operating basis,'' said DavidN. Fleischer of Prudential Bache Securities.   The Pittsburgh-based steel and energy giant said it would usethe proceeds from the sale to reduce its $5.8 billion debt and tobuy back stock in an effort to boost shareholder value and enhanceits balance sheet.   Texas Oil has been a disappointment to USX since it was acquiredin 1986 in a $3 billion stock swap.   ``I think shareholders have just lost their patience,''Fleischer said Monday after the sale was announced.   USX is showing a willingness to part with assets that probablywill appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stock'svalue now, he said.   ``This is a very strong statement that they're committed toshareholders,'' Fleischer said.   Chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporateraider Carl Icahn, who holds an 11 percent stake in USX.   Fleischer and analyst Frank Bracken of Fidelity Investments ofBoston valued the reserves at around $1.5 billion. A sale isanticipated by year's end, said USX spokesman William E. Keslar,who declined to say how USX values the reserves.   USX said it has retained the investment banking firm FirstBoston Corp. to handle the sale. The reserves are principallylocated in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado andKansas.   After racking up impressive operating income of $547 million in1984 and $377 million in 1985, Texas Oil andamp; Gas reported anoperating loss of $21 million the year USX acquired it. It thenbroke about even with $2 million the next year and lost $31 millionlast year.   The sale, besides boosting Texas Oil's earnings, will help withUSX's goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase of stockor raise the dividend, he said.   USX had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at Texas Oil onthe prospect of a surge in natural gas prices.   ``I'm bullish on gas prices,'' Bracken said. ``I'd expect overthe next two to three years gas would reach `btu' parity with oil.''   If priced equally with the energy content of oil at $20 perbarrel, gas would cost $2.50 to $2.75 per thousand cubic feet, hesaid. The spot price of gas now is around $1.50 per thousand cubicfeet, although it is expected to average $1.60 to $1.75 for theyear.   Texas Oil has 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in reserve,about a quarter of the 3.5 trillion cubic feet held by the otherUSX subsidiary, Marathon Oil Co. Texas Oil has 28 million barrelsof oil, or 3 percent of Marathon's 766 million.   The sale would not affect gas gathering, the bulk of TXO'sbusiness, or contract drilling, USX said. The steel company willretain Texas Oil's vast transmission business as well as its gasgathering and contract drilling business.   Gas gathering accounted for $538 million of TXO's $937 millionin total sales last year. Drilling and other activites had salestotaling $41 million.   The remainder, or $358 million, came from the sale of petroleum.</TEXT></DOC>
