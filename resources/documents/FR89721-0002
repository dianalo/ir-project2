Technical amendments arealso being made to up-date and conform the regulations to current BankBoard structure and current law. Finally, the appendices containing reportpreparation instructions are being revised to specify treatment of homeequity loans and to clarify other instructions. The Bank Board amendments do not address all significant aspects of theamended Fair Housing Act and new HUD regulations, because most of the broadnondiscrimination policies set forth in the existing regulations do notneed to be rewritten. However, all Bank System members and their counselshould carefully review the extensive amendments to HUD regulations (24CFR Parts 100 <T3>et seq.</T3>) distributed to members with FHLBB Thrift Bulletin No.19, dated March 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> June 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Gilda Morse, Senior Civil RightsSpecialist, (202) 906-6324 or Stephen D.

The Fair Housing AmendmentsAct of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-430; 102 Stat. 1619) amended Title VIII by (1)strengthening administrative enforcement procedures and private civil rightsof action, (2) adding prohibitions against discrimination in housing onthe basis of handicap and familial status (having one or more childrenunder the age of 18), and (3) increasing monetary damages that can be awardedwhere discriminatory housing practices are found. The amended law, referredto as the Fair Housing Act, became effective March 12, 1989. Implementingregulations were published by HUD on January 23, 1989, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 3232; Jan. 23, 1989) as amendments to24 CFR Parts 14, 100, 103-106, 109, 110, 115 and 121, effective March 12,1989. Bank Board regulations governing nondiscrimination by members of the FederalHome Loan Bank System, found at 12 CFR Parts 528 and 531(andSection; 531.8),are necessary (1) to affirmatively promote fair housing and lending asexpressly required by sections 808(d) and (e) of the Fair Housing Act,(2) to enforce the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act,the Housing and Community Development Act of 1977, the Equal Credit OpportunityAct and other statutes prohibiting discrimination, and (3) to monitor fairlending practices. Part 528 includes both prohibitions against discriminatorypractices and mandatory data collection requirements. Section 531.8, entitled``Guidelines relating to nondiscrimination in lending,'' provides supplementaryguidelines to aid Bank System member institutions in developing and implementingnondiscriminatory lending policies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Bank Board Amendments </ITAG>Section 528.1(c) is being amended in accordance with the Fair Housing Actby adding an explanation of ``dwelling-related'' in the definition of ``dwelling''to clarify that all loans secured by residential real estate are coveredby the Fair Housing Act and Part 528 of Bank Board regulations. This changeshould resolve any past confusion concerning how to classify home equityloans for monitoring and data collection purposes. A reference to the HUD Fair Housing regulations is being added to andSection;528.1a. Section 528.2 is being amended to include specific reference to purchasesof loans and securities as covered activities, in accordance with the FairHousing Act. In addition, protected classes are being expanded to includehandicap and familial status from the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988and marital status and age from the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. A referenceto the HUD Fair Housing regulations is also being added as an additionalsource of information and guidance. Handicap, familial status, marital status, and age are also being addedto andSection; 528.3(a) as protected classes. Sections 528.4 and 528.5 are being amended to adopt a new equal housinglender poster that includes the two new protected classes and reflectschanges in complaint handling. The new poster, approved by HUD for useby federal financial regulatory agencies, separates the Fair Housing Actand ECOA provisions and directs Fair Housing Act complainants to contactboth HUD and the Bank Board's Office of Community Investment. The instructions in the appendices to andSection; 528.6, explaining the preparationof loan application registers and data submission reports, have been clarifiedin response to past questions raised by member institutions. The treatmentof home equity loans has been specifically addressed. In addition, a numberof minor editorial revisions have been made to eliminate ambiguous instructionsand to clarify others. No changes have been made in the data required orthe forms for the reports. The appendices are being reprinted in full forthe convenience of member institutions.References in andSection; 528.7 to statutes and regulations requiring nondiscriminationin employment are being updated to include provisions that member institutionshave been subject to for some time. The complaint processing provision of andSection; 528.8 is being up-datedto reflect that the Office of Community Investment is the successor unitto the Office of Housing and Urban Affairs in the Bank Board, and to requirethat all Fair Housing Act complaints be sent to both HUD and the Bank Board.Section 531.8 is being amended to add handicap, familial status, maritalstatus, and age as protected classes and loan purchases as a covered activity.This regulation, effective immediately upon adoption by the Board, is beingissued without the notice and comment and delayed effective date requirementsof the Administrative Procedure Act, as amended (``APA''). Pursuant to5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), 553(d)(3) and in accordance with the Board's regulationspublished at 12 CFR 508.11 and 508.14, the Board has determined that theregulation is not subject either to the notice and comment or delayed effectivedate requirements of the APA because the regulations are necessary to conformthe Bank Board's regulations to statutory requirements and implementingregulations promulgated by HUD. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Bank Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis.HUD provided a Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis in its adoption of thefinal Fair Housing Act regulations at 54 FR 3280 (Jan. 23, 1989). 1. <T3>Need for and objectives of the rules. </T3>As explained in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, </T2>these amendments to Bank Board regulationsare mandatory under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and HUD's implementingregulations. 2. <T3>Issues raised by commenters and agency assessment and response. </T3>Sincethe amendments are mandatory and technical, public comment is not requiredand was not solicited. 3. <T3>Significant alternatives minimizing small-entity impact and response.</T3>No new requirements are being added by the amendments.
