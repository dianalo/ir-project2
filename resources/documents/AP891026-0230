Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, said Wednesday that foreigninterests control an estimated 21 percent of the U.S. bankingmarket. Financial experts say Japanese and other foreign banks arepoised to purchase additional U.S. banks.   ``Before this happens, before it is too late, I would ask the(Federal Reserve) to be cautious in permitting such takeoversbefore we fully understand how our economy is affected by increasedforeign ownsership of U.S. banks and financial services firms,''the banking chairman said.   Gonzalez' statement was prepared for a hearing by hisSubcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy. Alan Greenspan, chairmanof the Fed's board of governors, was the chief witnesss for thehearing, called to discuss the Fed's traditional independence.   Gonzalez said he was concerned the Fed has not been as sensitiveas some foreign competitors in enforcing the requirement thatforeign banks have the same opportunities as U.S. banks, with somespecial regulations and requirements for the foreign banks.   ``It is important that we have a better understanding of howforeign banks affect the profitability of domestic banks as well ashow such presence affects the availability of credit to domesticcorporations and individuals,'' he said.   In recent years, cash-rich Japanese banks have made significantinroads in the U.S. market by adding and expanding their own branchoffices here, or buying into established financial units, frombanking to securities operations. In the largest such transactionyet, Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank _ the world's biggest bank _agreed last month to acquire a 60 percent interest in CIT Group,the financial services unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., forabout $1.4 billion.   Other recent major transactions have included the $750 millionacquisition of Union Bank by California First Bank last year andDaiwa Bank Ltd.'s agreement to acquire the U.S. commercial bankingoperations of Britain's Lloyds Bank PLC for about $200 million.   Japanese-owned banks now reportedly account for nearly 20percent of the banking business in California, while eight of the10 largest foreign bank branches in New York are part of Japanesebanks.   Japanese institutions make about 5 percent of all U.S. loans andhold about 9 percent of U.S. banking assets, according to industryestimates, and the figures are expected to grow in the next 18months as Japanese banks try to remain competitive with each other.</TEXT></DOC>
