At last, someone isattacking the non-standard SQL problem.andP;  SQL Access Group is dedicated topromoting interoperability among SQL-based relational database managementsystems (RDBMSs).andP;  Under the development is a set of detailed specificationsfor a standard programming interface and a network communication protocol toallow applications and DBMS servers from different vendors to communicate.andO;The SQL Access Group is focusing its efforts to communication among SQL-basedapplications and DBMSs, basing its specifications on the SQL standard and onthe evolving ISO Remote Data Access (RDA) standard.andP;  The group plans topublish a technical guide to interoperability in early 1990; a workingdemonstration of its implementation will follow in the second hald of theyear.andM;THE GOAL.andP;  The goal is transparent access between a client application and adatabase server.andP;  Ideally, any application on any system will be able toaccess any data over any network.andP;  Needless to say, achieving this is acomplex problem with several dimensions.andP;  The problem applies not only toaccessing relational databases (the focus of the new group), but to accessingthe vast amounts of data stored in nonrelational and file systems as well.andO;This is far more than just a networking problem.andM;Client/Server Protocols.andP;  Client applications and database servers usedifferent client/server protocols to talk to each other.andP;  An Oracleapplication, for example, cannot connect to a Digital Rdb server because itsends SQL statements in a different sequence than the one Rdb expects toreceive.andP;  The messages sent by the client are not intelligible to the serverand vice versa.andP;  The client/server protocol must be consistently implementedto achieve interoperability.andP;  It must also be implemented the same wayregardless of whether the transport is SNA, DECnet, TCP/IP, etc.andP;  andaccomodate multiple networks.andM;The ISO/RDA committee is addressing this client/server protocol issue.andP;  Thecommunications portion of the SQL Access Group's solution will be RDA-based.andO;One objective is to speed up the work currently being done by the ISO/RDAcommittee.andM;SQL Implementations.andP;  With the existence of an SQL standard, one would expectto see SQL implemented consistently across RDBMSs.andP;  But this is not the case.andO;As written, the SQL standard is not detailed enough to ensure a standardimplementation.andP;  Not only are there semantic differences between vendorimplementations of the same SQL statement, but each vendor has also chosenits own set of extensions to its set of &quot;standard&quot; SQL statements.andM;A related issue is inconsistent datatypes among RDBMSs.andP;  Different databasessupport different datatypes, and can even define the same datatype (e.g.,andO;floating point) in different ways.andP;  Other problems include differentinternational character sets, and the need to translate between ASCII andEBCDIC.andM;Error Codes.andP;  Another aspect of incompatibility is each vendor's set ofproprietary error code.andP;  A foreign client application cannot understand theerror messages received from the server.andM;Data Dictionary.andP;  There is a wide divergence among RDBMSs in how the datadictionary is structured and accessed.andP;  This is a critical issue since thedata dictionary describes the database and must be accessible to both thedeveloper and the application/user.andM;THE CURRENT SOLUTIONS.andP;  There are three approaches to DBMS interoperabilitytoday: the SQL Access Group, Sybase's Open Client/Server, and Open Desktop.andO;None of these provides a complete solution.andM;SQL ACCESS GROUP.andP;  The SQL Access Group's focus is on developing an SQLserver specification detailed enough to produce database interoperability andapplication portability when implemented by multiple DBMS vendors.andP;  The keyis implementation consistency.andP;  The same front-end tools and applicationswill operate against any compliant DBMS server, allowing a developer to writevendor-independent database applications.andM;Technical Specification.andP;  The specification will be base on existingstandards, and will include both an SQL Application Programming Interface(API) and a formats and protocols (FAP) specification.andP;  When published, thespecification will be available to anyone for the cost of the documentation.andO;It will also be submitted to the standards bodies for adoption.andP;  The groupdid not indicate that it would provide certification services, although itwill develop a working, heterogeneous demonstration of the specification.andM;The SQL API developed by the SQL Access Group will be of the &quot;commondenominator&quot; variety (you can choose the appropriate modifier--&quot;greatest&quot; or&quot;least&quot;--depending on your perspective).andP;  It will also include escapemechanisms to allow use of a DBMS's proprietary language and extensions tothe standard SQL.andM;The FAP specification will cover communication between a single-vendor clientand a single-vendor server.andP;  There will be no distributed databasecapabilities initially.andP;  The RDA standard simply defines communicationbetween a single client and a single server.andP;  It does not includecommunications between servers, nor does it handle distributed databaseissues, such as a client accessing multiple database servers in a singletransaction or SQL statement.andM;Providing a consistent SQL interface across multivendor DBMSs is the firststep in building a strong platform for heterogeneous distributed databases.andO;The group stated that the second release of the specification will include atwo-phase commit protocol, although this by itself is not sufficient fordistributed databases.andP;  There also must be an automatic recovery manager, andeach vendor would have to build its own until the specification includes it.andM;Members.andP;  The SQL Access Group, formed in August 1989, is a non-profitorganization open to all vendors.andP;  Current members include Ashton-Tate,Digital, Fujitsu America Incorporated, Hewlett-Packard, Informix, Ingres,Metaphor, NCR, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Tandem Computers, TeradataCorporation, and Wang.andP;  Notably missing is IBM.andP;  The group expectsthird-party activity to define SQL access to DB2 if IBM does not join.andO;Sybase originally participated but dropped out since it felt that its OpenClient/Server approach was more appropriate.andM;SYBASE OPEN SERVER.andP;  Sybase is licensing its client and server APIs toprovide hardware-, software- and network-independent client/servercommunications.andP;  Developers and user organizations will now be able tointegrate non-Sybase front ends and servers into the Sybase environment usingthe Sybase Open Client and Open Server APIs.andP;  The most significant aspect ofthe new Open Server: It can interface to any server, and is not limited toSQL-based Servers.andP;  We covered the Sybase Open Server in some detail in lastmonth's News Analysis.andM;Sybase has solved the communications problem, but not the applicationincompatibilities.andP;  In the Sybase approach, any Open Client can communicatewith any Open Server, but the solution is not language- and errorcode-independent.andP;  The language encapsulated in a Sybase remote storedprocedure is proprietary to the server.andP;  The user must also provide some ofthe translations necessary, for example, between proprietary and Sybasegeneric error code constructs.andM;One advantage provided by the Sybase Open Client/Server APIs is the abilityto communicate server-to-server as well.andP;  Neither Open Desktop nor the SQLAccess Group has stated plans to thikle this problem.andM;OPEN DESKTOP.andP;  Open Desktop is a package bundled for the 386 Unix platform.andO;It includes software from Digital and HP (OSF/Motif), Ingres (Ingres RDBMS),Locus (distributed file system), and SCO (the Unix operating system).andP;  As theDBMS provider for the Open Desktop suite, Ingres has implemented features tofacilitate access to heterogeneous DBMSs.andM;One is its global communications architecture (GCA), which is animplementation of RDA for the client/server protocol and a gateway serverthat runs on the platform with the DBMS server.andP;  With Ingres 6.0, theseservers can be Ingres, IBM's DB2 or SQL/DS, or Digital's Rdb.andP;  (When RDAreaches international standard status--which is expected in 1991--Ingres willmove to the full standard.)andM;Ingres has also developed what it calls Open SQL, a set of SQL statementscommon across the set of DBMSs accessible to an Ingres application.andP;  Open SQLis a subset of the full Ingres SQL.andP;  Like the SQL Access Group's API, OpenSQL is a common denominator among the DBMSs.andP;  Ingres has also chosen toimplement some features even though not all accessible DBMSs support them.andO;For example, Open SQL supports repeat queries, emulating this for DBMSs thatdon't.andM;The Ingres approach achieves portability of applications.andP;  As long as theapplication is written with Open SQL, it doesn't matter whether the back-endDBMS is Ingres, DB2, SQL/DS, or Rdb.andP;  The gateway will be able to make theappropriate translations.andM;Current limitations to the Open Desktop solution include the fact that theapplication must be an Ingres application, and that the Ingres-developedgateway server is necessary to translate SQL statements, datatypes, errorcodes, and the data dictionary.andP;  It also cannot access non-SQL-based DBMSs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
