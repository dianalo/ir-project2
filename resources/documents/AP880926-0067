A ratification vote was set for Wednesday, and union leaderspredicted approval.   The key money issue in the contract dispute was whether BART orits employees should benefit from an estimated $10 million-a-yearwindfall from investments from the Public Employees RetirementSystem, to which BART contributes.   The old contract required the turning over of profits to theworkers. BART wanted two-thirds of the money to go towardoperations.   The tentative agreement announced Sunday calls for the profitsto be used for three years to finance medical insurance for retiredemployees. The union agreed that members also would pay $15 permonth toward the retirees' benefit.   ``We're happy. They're happy,'' said BART spokesman Mike Healy.   Local 790, which had been working without a contract since June,had set a strike time of 12:01 a.m. today. Local 1555 of theAmalgamated Transit Union, which represents 500 station agents andtrain operators, had promised to honor picket lines.   The district had hoped to offer about half the normal trainservice, but only during certain hours of the day.   Many of the 100,000 people who ride the 71-mile system to workand back each weekday had spent much of the weekend trying to findalternative ways to get to their jobs. At least one was set to gosailing _ to work.   ``I'm planning to sail my boat to Fisherman's Wharf in SanFrancisco, let my wife sail the bay the rest of the day, and thenhave her pick us up after work,'' said Don Ravetti of Berkeleybefore the strike settlement was announced.</TEXT></DOC>
