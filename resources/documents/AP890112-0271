The proposed sale is the centerpiece of an independent plan ofreorganization that management intends to present in bankruptcycourt, where creditors had backed the proposal from the securitiesfirm Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc.   The company also said it entered a letter of intent with Spear,Leeds andamp; Kellog, head of a shareholders' committee that hadpreviously battled management, to finance management's plan.   The Oster-Sunbeam division makes a range of small householdappliances, including shavers, mixers and other kitchen appliances.   Black andamp; Decker, based in Towson, Md., manufactures and sellspower tools, accessories, household appliances and lawn careequipment.   Under management's plan, Allegheny International would be leftwith businesses that include lawn furniture, gas grills, electricblankets, scales and clocks, among other things.   ``The consensus is they just abdicated,'' unsecured creditors'counsel Robert Sable said after the board confirmed publishedreports that it voted down the Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette plan onWednesday.   ``It's time the creditors take control of the case,'' he said.   In voting to cancel its earlier tentative merger agreement withDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, the board cited the securities firm'ssubsequent arrangement with a rival bidder, the Paul S. Levymerchant banker group, to carve up the company between them.   Allegheny International said it would ask U.S. Bankruptcy Courtfor sanctions against Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette and against theLevy group.   In its latest version, the Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette planwould have sold Allegheny International's lawn furniture and gasgrill business to the Levy group for about $250 million, accordingto the Wall Street Journal.   Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette would have retained theOster-Sunbeam division.   In another late change, Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette would haveput $30 million less common equity into the deal than it had earlierproposed, according to the New York Times.   Allegheny International said Thursday it had asked the bankruptcycourt to void the agreement with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.   ``We were surprised, we're disappointed and we're examining ouroptions,'' said Peter A. Joseph, a partner in the Levy group.   ``We're amazed and disappointed that the board, having postponeda decision from November to December and then from December toJanuary has now rejected the sale route altogether,'' said WilburRoss of Rothschild Inc., an adviser to the unsecured creditors.   The board announced a tentative merger agreement with Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette last November after the major creditor groups shotdown an earlier reorganization plan from management and forced theboard to offer the company for sale.   Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette and Levy both made independentbuyout proposals. The board twice endorsed the securities firm'soffer, only to withdraw support when Levy sweetened its bid.   Both plans would have repaid creditors nearly in full. Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette would have given stockholders 40 percent of thereorganized company, which would have closely resembled the currentAllegheny International.   The Levy group would have given shareholders 49 percent equity inwhat was left after selling the Oster-Sunbeam unit to reduce debt.</TEXT></DOC>
