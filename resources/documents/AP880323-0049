Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won the Kansas contest with278 of the 764 local delegates elected and Jesse Jackson finishedsecond with 235.

Bennett said hedoubts it.   He said the Ohio activity is limited to Cincinnati, where somelocal party candidates who support Robertson have been pushing forright-to-life legislation in various public forums for years.   ``There is no concerted effort to take over the partyorganization in Ohio,'' Bennett said. He said many Robertsonbackers are disenchanted former Democrats and others, new to thepolitical process, who seek Republican values that he summed upthis way: ``Married, with 4.2 kids, and go to church on Sunday.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Robertson Oregon Office To Close</HEAD><DATELINE>SALEM, Ore.
