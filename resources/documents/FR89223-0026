The new section requires that no person shall sell or supplygasoline from a bulk plant or terminal having a Reid Vapor Pressure greaterthan 9.0 pounds per square inch (psi) from May 1 through September 15 beginningin 1989 and continuing each year thereafter. The revision also revisesregulation 310 CMR 7.00 to add definitions for ``bulk plants and terminals,''``gasoline,'' ``gasoline marketing facility,'' and ``Reid Vapor Pressure.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On November 12, 1987, the Commission of the Northeast States for CoordinatedAir Use Management (NESCAUM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding expressingtheir intention to reduce the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline to10.0 pounds per square inch starting in the summer of 1988 and to 9.0 psiin the summer of 1989 and continuing every ozone season thereafter. TheCommonwealth of Massachusetts held hearings on a regulation to implementsuch a strategy on January 5 and 7, 1988. Since there were delays in adoptingnecessary regulations, the 1988 limit of 10.0 psi has been eliminated andMassachusetts is limiting RVP to 9.0 psi from May 1 to September 15 startingin 1989, and continuing each year thereafter. On July 13, 1988 Massachusettssubmitted a SIP revision to implement this provision to EPA for approval.EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on August 19, 1987 (52 FR31274) which would also require the control of RVP. The EPA proposal callsfor control of the volatility of gasoline nationally. In that notice, EPAproposed that in the Northeast the standard would be 10.5 psi from May16 to September 15 in the years 1989_1991 and 9.0 psi during the same timeperiod in 1992 and thereafter. One option EPA is currently consideringis taking final action now only on the 10.5 psi standard to be effectivebeginning in 1989 as an interim standard. The EPA regulation, when finalized,would normally preempt the state provision, under section 211(c)(4) ofthe Clean Air Act (the Act). However, section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act providesfor approval of state control of fuel or fuel additives if the controlis part of the SIP and is necessary to achieve the primary or secondarynational ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) which the plan implements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for Approval</ITAG>There are two different situations under which EPA might ultimately takefinal action on Massachusetts' RVP regulation:(1) If EPA has not taken final action on its proposed RVP regulations sothat there is no federal preemption of state regulation; or(2) If EPA has taken final action and there is federal preemption. Eithersituation could occur within the time frame anticipated for final EPA approvalof this SIP revision.Section 211(c)(4)(A) of the Act, in describing federal preemption authority,states:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), no State(or political subdivision thereof) may prescribe or attempt to enforce,for the purposes of motor vehicle emission control, any control or prohibitionrespecting use of a fuel or fuel additive in a motor vehicle engine_(i)if the Administrator has found that no control or prohibition under paragraph(1) is necessary and has published his finding in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>or (ii) if the Administrator has prescribedunder paragraph (1) a control prohibition applicable to such fuel or fueladditive, unless [the] State prohibition or control is identical to theprohibition or control prescribed by the Administrator.''</ITAG>For the reasons described below, we do not believe this section of theAct preempts approval of the Massachusetts revision. First, EPA has notmade the finding described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (A), that nofuel control or prohibition under paragraph (1) of section 211(c) is necessary;and EPA clearly has not published any such findings in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>In fact EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(52 FR 31274) on August 19, 1987 which, when finalized, would control RVP.But this proposed federal RVP control is not yet final. Therefore, preemptionhas not yet occurred, and DEQE is free to adopt and enforce its own RVPcontrols at this time.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ One court, in Exxon v. City of New York, 548 F.2d 1088(2d cir. 1977), has suggested that EPA's regulation of the lead contentof gasoline amounts under subparagraph (ii) to the preemption of Statecontrols of any aspect of the content of gasoline (unless identical tothe federal lead content control). EPA does not agree with that holdingand hence does not believe that the reasoning of the decision should applyin cases involving State fuel regulations other than regulation of leadcontent.Second, even if preemption were to occur, EPA may still approve certainstate provisions for limits on RVP of fuel where it can make a findingunder section 211(c)(4)(C) which would authorize EPA approval and, thus,eliminate the preemption problem. As set forth below, section 211(c)(4)(C)authorizes EPA to approve into the SIP a state-adopted fuel control measurethat has otherwise been preempted by final EPA action if EPA finds thatthe state control ``is necessary to achieve the standard'' that the SIPimplements.Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, in setting forth the circumstances underwhich an exception to federal preemption of state regulation may occur,states:<ITAG tagnum="21">A State may prescribe and enforce, for purposes of motor vehicle emissioncontrol, a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuel or fueladditive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine if an applicable implementationplan for such State under section 110 so provides. The Administrator mayapprove such provision in an implementation plan, or promulgate an implementationplan containing such a provision, only if he finds that the State controlor prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primary or secondaryambient air qualify standard which the plan implements.</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>discussion of EPA's approval of a state oxygenatedfuels program in the Maricopa County, Arizona SIP, EPA interpreted thislanguage as requiring the Agency to find that a fuel control requirementwas essential to achieve timely attainment of the standard. EPA said furtherthat a fuel control measure may be ``necessary'' for timely attainmentif no other measures that would bring about timely attainment exist, orif such other measures exist and are technically possible to implement,but are unreasonable or impracticable. Otherwise, no fuel control wouldever be ``necessary,'' since for any area there is at least one measure_namely,required shutdowns and prohibitions on driving_that would result in timelyattainment of the carbon monoxide NAAQS. It is doubtful that Congress wouldhave intended to bar EPA from approving State fuel controls into a SIPbased on the availability of such drastic alternatives.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T4>Federal Register </T4>August 10, 1988, 53 FR 30220, 30228. <ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation of How the Massachusetts Revision Satisfies the ``Necessary''Criterion.</ITAG>The Massachusetts submittal and related documents contain the State's analysisof the emission reductions that various measures would achieve and theremaining shortfall. That analysis concludes that the Massachusetts RVPregulation would reduce VOC emissions by an estimated 9000 tons per year(TPY). The quantity of reduction was derived from AP-42 emission factorsfor storage and transfer of gasoline and from the EPA MOBILE 3 emissionfactor model for motor vehicle emissions. This estimate may understatethe actual reductions because it does not include the emissions reductionsthat would result from decreased running losses associated with lower volatilitygasoline. Running losses are emissions from the gasoline tank and fuelsystem that occur while a car is being driven and which result from anoverload of the evaporative control system or escape through the fillercap. Information available in the Massachusetts SIP and Reasonable Further Progress(RFP) Reports for 1986 and 1987, along with supplemental inventory informationsubmitted by the state, were used in making the following findings. The1987 RFP report shows that Massachusetts has achieved a 44% reduction ofVOC emissions on a statewide basis from 1980 emissions. Based on EPA'sexperience with Regional Oxidant Model runs of 1980 it seems likely thata reduction on the order of at least 60% from 1980 levels is needed forattainment of the ozone standard. Under this scenario, the emission reduction from 1987 levels needed forattainment translates to at least a 28% reduction from the 1987 inventory.The VOC strategies identified by the MA DEQE as having the greatest potentialfor significant future VOC reductions are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,8,9</C><H1>Measure</H1><H1>Tons reduced, tpy </H1><H1>Percent of 87 inventory</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">RVP 11.5 to 9.0 psi <D>9,000 </D><D>5.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Consumer/commercial solvents <D>7,400 </D><D>\1\ 4.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Stage II controls <D>6,200 </D><D>3.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Architectural coatings <D>5,700 </D><D>\1\ 3.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/> <D>16.0</D><F>\1\ These are emissions from the entire category and could probablynever be fully reduced due to the nature of available controls on thesearea sources. Many of these formulations cannot be fully reformulated orreplaced and, because they are area source emissions, cannot be effectivelycaptured and controlled.</F></ITAG>No other categories of available controls will individually yield reductionsof more than 1.5% of the 1987 inventory. The cumulative total of otheravailable control strategies may reach 4%, which would yield approximatelya 20% reduction in conjunction with the above controls if all controlswere 100% effective. This still leaves at least an 8% VOC emission reductionshortfall. In order to make up this shortfall, the State is consideringchanges to its motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program alongwith other measures as part of the Post-1987 ozone SIP planning processwhich will help reduce somewhat the shortfall. A reasonable level of I/Menhancement could produce an additional 2% emission reduction. Thus, evenif such reasonable I/M enhancements are implemented, a shortfall will stillexist necessitating the implementation of other measures to achieve attainment.Even if EPA does promulgate an RVP regulation requiring control to 10.5psi in 1989, the State regulation will still provide additional reductions.No other measures that are clearly reasonable for implementation in Massachusettscould provide sufficient reductions to achieve attainment without the StateRVP control.Thus Massachusetts' RVP program appears to meet the appropriate test ofbeing ``necessary'' to achieve attainment of the ozone standard. The factthat the state RVP regulation might not by itself fill the remaining shortfalland hence by itself achieve the standard does not mean the rule would notbe ``necessary'' to achieve the standard within the meaning of Section211(c)(4)(C). EPA believes that if Congress had intended EPA to approvea State fuel-content rule only if it were necessary and sufficient to achievethe standard, then it would have used that language in Section 211(c)(4)(C).EPA believes that the ``necessary to achieve'' standard must be interpretedto apply to measures which are needed to reduce ambient levels (thus bringingthe area closer to achieving the NAAQS) when no other reasonable measuresare available to achieve this reduction. A contrary application of ``necessaryto achieve'' in this situation would mean that measures which result insignificantly improved air quality are nonetheless unacceptable (even thoughno other reasonable measures are available) just because they are insufficientto actually result in attainment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Enforceability</ITAG>In EPA's review for the enforceability of the Massachusetts revision aproblem with the test methods section (310 CMR 7.02(12)(e)(2)(b)) was revealed.The state requires that fuel sampling and testing shall be conducted inaccordance with ASTM methods (D4177-82, or D4057-81, and D323-58), allof which are acceptable to EPA, or ``. . . any other method approved bythe Department.'' EPA has informed the state that alternative methods mustbe approved by EPA as well. The state has committed to revise this sectionto resolve this problem. DEQE may drop the alternative method languageor may require approval by EPA as well. EPA is proposing to approve theDEQE's RVP controls with the understanding that the state must revise thetest methods section to cure the problem with alternative test methodsprior to final EPA action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve this revision to the Massachusetts Ozone StateImplementation Plan to control gasoline volatility with the understandingthat the state will revise the test method section of the regulation priorto final Agency action. EPA is also proposing to make a finding that thisSIP revision meets the requirements of Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Actfor an exception to federal preemption at such time as EPA promulgatesregulations to control the volatility of fuel. EPA's regulations were proposedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 19, 1987 (32 FR 31274).Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects for 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the plan revisionswill be based on whether it meets the requirements of Sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K),110(a)(3) and 211(c)(4)(C) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulationsin 40 CFR Part 51.
