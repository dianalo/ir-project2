Thus, federal banking regulators said, theseaccounts must identify the owners by Sept. 30, 1992.Registrations of account holders will begin July 1. Swissbanks had about 30,000 such accounts at the end of 1989.   But banks may continue to open anonymous accounts if thedeposits they hold pertain to pending legal proceedings, suchas divorces or inheritances.   Swiss banking secrecy laws, some of the world's tightest,date back to 1934. Their only crime deterrent has been a rulethat a legal representative must attest the client isn'ttrying to conceal illegal activity. Since a billion-dollarmoney-laundering scandal two years ago, Switzerland hassought to change its reputation as a haven for illicit cash.                                                                                                          ALBANIA OFFERS CAR RENTALS                                                                                                          Albania's first rent-a-car agency opened in Tirana, with50 new cars. The red French Peugeot 505s parked in the centerof the capital drew crowds of admirers in a city with only afew hundred cars. Most Albanians get around on bicycles. Thestate tourism concern Albtourist is operating the car-rentalservice.                                                                                                          HANOI DETAILS PARTY PURGE                                                                                                          Vietnam's Communist Party expelled 78,200 members between1988 and 1990 in a campaign to improve its image and wipe outcorruption. The secretive ruling body's unusual disclosurecame as it prepares for its June congress on economic andpolitical policies for the next five years. The leadership,shaken by Eastern European communism's collapse, is trying toimprove the party's image, combat corruption and abuse ofpower, and rebuild popular ties.                                                                                                          BRAZIL'S BANK AIDE AVOIDS JAIL                                                                                                          Brazil's central bank president, Ibrahim Eris, narrowlyescaped spending a night in jail after a judge ordered hisarrest on a technicality. When 18 police officers went to Mr.Eris's office, he was discussing Brazil's huge foreign debtelsewhere in the bank, where he hid until they left. Thejudge ordered Mr. Eris's arrest because he hadn't obeyed acourt order unblocking a stockbroking firm's assets frozen ina liquidation. A higher court later canceled the warrant,ruling that jailing Mr. Eris wasn't necessary.                                                                                                          NORTH KOREA ACCUSED AT HOME                                                                                                          In what was believed to be the first time North Korea wasaccused publicly on its own soil, delegates to aninternational conference condemned Pyonyang for alleged humanrights abuses. Inter-Parliamentary Union conferees raisedquestions about political prisoners, basic civil andpolitical rights, and press freedom, prompting an angrydenial by North Koreans. Amnesty International reports atleast 12 camps for political prisoners have more than 100,000inmates.                                                                                                          POLAND'S CONSTITUTION TURNS 200                                                                                                          Poland marked the 200th anniversary of Europe's firstwritten constitution, celebrating it as a historicachievement akin to the Solidarity revolution that overthrewcommunism in 1989. On May 3, 1791, a liberal bill of rightswas passed, reforming gentry-ruled Poland, setting up amodern constitutional monarchy, and laying &quot;the foundationsfor the functioning of a modern democratic state,&quot; PresidentLech Walesa said. But Solidarity leader Bronislaw Geremekwarned that the party mustn't allow internal rivalries todestroy the movement's legacy.                                                                                                          WAGE SETTLEMENT IN GERMANY                                                                                                          German negotiators agreed yesterday on a hefty 6.7% wageincrease for the powerful IG Metall union this year, avertinga full-scale strike in the auto and engineering industries.   The accord, which is in line with settlements in otherindustries, defuses the threat of a crippling labor conflictin newly unified Germany. But industry and governmentofficials worry about lost competitiveness and freshinflation pressures. The wage trend is more than doublingwestern Germany's annual inflation rate, which was running2.8% in April.   Hans Tietmeyer, a Bundesbank director, said this year'swage explosion forces the central bank to keep interest rateshigh, even as other nations, notably the U.S., are cuttingrates to spur their economies. Workers in western Germanyalready are the best paid in the world.   The accord, which followed three days of one-hour workstoppages, covers only workers in the Stuttgart region,although it is expected to be adopted today for all ofwestern Germany's 3.7 million IG Metall workers. IG Metall'sone million members in eastern German previously reached aseparate contract, promising equal wages by the end of 1994.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          The European Community lifted a five-week ban on importsof fresh U.S. horsemeat, imposed after trichinosis cases werereported. Many people in France and Belgium are fond ofhorse, sold by special butcher shops. . . . In Sudan, a judgedecided that murderers may compensate victims' relatives bypaying so-called blood money, $44,000, rather than the 100camels specified by Islamic Sharia law, because the animalsare in short supply, Khartoum's Al-Sudan al-Hadith newspaperreported.</TEXT></DOC>
