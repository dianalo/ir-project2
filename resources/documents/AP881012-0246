Dean D. Thornton, president of the Boeing operating company,said Tuesday that of the 161 747-400s ordered by 21 customers, 20planes will be delivered an average of one month past thepreviously agreed upon date.   ``We intend to obtain Federal Aviation Administrationcertification of the 747-400 in December, to deliver the first twoaircraft that month and to be back on our original schedule bymid-1989,'' Thornton said.   Two deliveries will be pushed back from December to early 1989,and there will be a substantial reduction in first-quarter 1989deliveries, the company said in a news release. Most of thedeliveries will be made up in the second quarter of 1989, it said.   Thornton said far more orders for the new jet were received fromcustomers on an earlier schedule than anticipated when the programwas launched in October 1985.   Thornton said the delays are due to the increase of 747production rates at Boeing's Everett plant from two planes to fivea month and to customers seeking a wider variety of planeconfigurations than on earlier programs.   The delays also stem from the 747-400s being offered with threedifferent engine types, with each being introduced and certified ina record four months.   Boeing is doing its best to minimize the impact of the delays oncustomers, Thornton said, including working overtime andreassigning additional experienced workers to the 747 plant.   The new jet, which made its first flight earlier this year, isthe largest commercial jet in production. The plane will be able tocarry 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles, and greater passengerloads on shorter trips.</TEXT></DOC>
