All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-41-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>On November 8, 1988, the FAA issued AD 88-24-08, Amendment 39-6071 (53FR 46433; November 17, 1988), to require external eddy current inspectionsfor fuselage skin and longeron cracks on McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9 seriesairplanes prior to the accumulation of 55,000 landings. On December 28,1988, the FAA issued AD 88-24-08, Revision 1 (R1), Amendment 39-6108 (54FR 1675; January 17, 1989), which revised the existing AD to require externaleddy current inspections for fuselage skin and longeron cracks on McDonnellDouglas Model DC-9 series airplanes prior to the accumulation of 45,000landings. Those actions were prompted by reports of skin and longeron cracksat various overwing fuselage stations. This condition, if not corrected,could degrade the structural integrity of the fuselage and lead to possiblerapid decompression.Since the issuance of that revised AD, there have been additional reportsof cracked or failed longerons on airplanes with fewer than 35,000 landings.One operator has reported finding skin and longeron cracks on three airplaneshaving accumulated between 32,745 and 39,823 landings.In addition, the FAA has determined that internal visual inspections aremore effective for detecting cracks on certain locations than are the eddycurrent inspections currently required.The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Service Bulletin53-230, Revision 2, dated April 21, 1989, which recommends a revised (lower)threshold for initial inspections, describes procedures for internal visualinspections, and provides instructions for interim and permanent repairs.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthis same type design, this action proposes to revise AD 88-24-08-R1 tolower the threshold for initial external eddy current inspections for skinand longeron cracks on airplanes, prior to the total accumulation of 30,000landings, and to require visual internal inspections and repair, if necessary,in accordance with the service bulletin previously described.On December 28, 1988, the FAA issued a Supplemental Notice of ProposedRulemaking, Docket 88-NM-178-AD (54 FR 1726; January 17, 1989), which proposedto require repetitive visual inspections of the longerons from longeron10 left through 10 right from inside the fuselage, and repair, if necessary.The FAA has now determined that it is more appropriate to include thoseinspection requirements in this proposed action; consequently, the FAAintends to withdraw Docket 88-NM-178-AD.  There are approximately 732 Model DC-9 series airplanes of the affecteddesign in the worldwide fleet. It is estimated that 578 airplanes of U.S.registry would be affected by this AD, that it would take approximately100 manhours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and thatthe average labor cost would be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures,the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,312,000for the initial inspection cycle.  The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment  </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]  </ITAG>1.
