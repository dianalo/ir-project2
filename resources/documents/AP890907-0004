(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hot Springs has an army of silver-hairedambassadors who love to brag about mineral springs, pure air andcheap living in the Ouachita Mountains.   When a prospective senior settler calls the Greater Hot SpringsChamber of Commerce-run Retiree Recruitment Office, coordinator GailEzelle unleashes the 150-strong force of volunteers whose enthusiasmbubbles like this resort's hot spring water.   Dapper in matching blue blazers, breast pockets adorned withtheir names and the city logo, the volunteers court potential newneighbors with answers about health care, expenses, and recreation.   They escort guests up the 216-foot Hot Springs Mountain Tower fora panoramic view, then head downtown for a look at restoredBathhouse Row. The leisurely tour may end with a meal, or maybe asunset cruise aboard a Lake Hamilton party barge.   The personal pitches have been potent. The office has fieldedmore than 6,500 inquiries since it started advertising nationallylast summer; it takes credit for 75 moves. Part of its success comesfrom a 1987 Rand-McNally study listing Hot Sprngs as the nation'sthird most desirable retirement spot, after the Murray-KentuckyLake, Ky., and Clayton-Clarksville, Ga., areas.   To Mrs. Ezelle, 55, who moved from Texas, recruiting retirees isjust like recruiting an industry. ``They have such a tremendouseconomic impact on the community, and they give us expertise andenthusiasm.''   But retirees don't bring some of industry's bothersome baggage:pollution, clogged highways and fluctuating workforces. They arrivewith average assets of $215,000 and average annual incomes of$33,000, along with taxes and spare time to devote to communityactivities. That equates to an annual economic impact of more than$9 million, the office estimates.   Mrs. Ezelle praises her volunteer corps, who buy their ownjackets, pay for their own gas and provide any extras, such as lakecruises or meals. She offers a toll-free telephone line andcomplimentary passes to the mountain tower.   Aggressive retiree recruitment is nothing new. But Hot Springs isinnovating by applying the concept to an existing city instead of acarefully planned senior citizens development, said aging expertCharles F. Longino Jr.   ``Arkansas has been a nice place for people to retire for a longtime, so they have a tradition up there,'' said Longino, associatedirector of the Center for Adult Development and Aging at theUniversity of Miami.   ``But the difference with Hot Springs is they are really goingafter the retirees, instead of letting the retirees come to them.States have to kind of compete for retirees. They bring expendableincome and lots of advantages. And older people rarely movesomeplace where they don't know anybody.''   That's why volunteers like Dick and Marge Bingham are valuable _they know what it's like to downshift from a fast-paced workinglifestyle.   The Binghams moved to Hot Springs in 1987 from Covina, Calif.,their home for more than three decades. Dick, 57, knew it was timeto get out when his 28-minute commute to a securities office turnedinto a 1{-hour headache.   They were familiar with Arkansas because their daughter andgrandchildren live in Mena, on the state's western edge. A deal on alake house clinched the decision. And once Dick unwound after threemonths of relaxation, he decided to tell others about Hot Springs.   Marge, 53, says she was floored by friendliness. ``Out inCalifornia, it was so huge and impersonal. We maybe knew ourneighbors across the street and on either side of us. But here,we've already got 50 to 100 close friends, and 500 speakingacquaintances. I love it.''   Dick Bingham likes to end a recruiting session by inviting guestsonto his party barge, docked a few yards behind his home on LakeHamilton. He doffs the blazer, kicks back and steers the vesseltoward the setting sun.   Marge waves to a passing dinner cruise boat; two dozen strangerswave back. ``See what I mean? Everybody's friendly. Heck, inCalifornia, if a guy raises his hand like that, he may have a gun init.''   The office generally refrains from bashing other states, butproudly displayed is a map showing states generating the mostinquiries this year shaded in blue. In descending order, they areCalifornia (400 calls); Illinois (314); New York (291); Texas (265);and Florida (221).</TEXT></DOC>
