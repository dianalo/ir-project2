Suchdebt settlement plans would cover all debts owed and would provide forthe disposition of the committees' remaining funds and assets. In contrast,committees that are not terminating would not be permitted to settle theirjust debts. However, their creditors would be allowed to completely forgivethose debts if the committee is essentially defunct and clearly unableto pay its creditors. Please note that the proposed rules would cover severalspecific types of debts not mentioned in the current regulations, suchas debts owed to unincorporated commercial vendors, committee employees,and other individuals. However, the proposed rules which follow would notapply to bank loans to candidates or political committees since this formof debt is governed by other regulations at 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11) and 100.8(b)(12),and is currently the subject of a separate rulemaking. <T3>See</T3> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 51 FR 28154 (Aug. 5, 1986);and Announcement of hearing, 52 FR 2416 (Jan. 22, 1987). The Commissiondoes not generally consider bank loans in the debt settlement process anddoes not intend to change its approach. Another area addressed by theseproposals involves situations where a candidate has multiple campaign committeesfor different elections and/or different offices, and certain of thesecommittees have surplus funds or the ability to raise funds while othercommittees are significantly in debt.This proposed new approach has been developed with several interrelatedobjectives in mind. One objective is to ensure that debt settlements, andthe initial transactions creating the debts, do not result in excessiveor prohibited contributions to the debtor committees. This concern promptedthe Commission to adopt the current debt settlement regulations in 1977.Since that time, the Commission's experiences in reviewing debt settlementshave illustrated the need to encourage candidates and political committeesto pay their debts. Previous debt settlements have also demonstrated theneed to reduce the actual or perceived unfairness to certain creditorsthat may occur when a committee liquidates its assets to pay its debtsin a piecemeal manner.<ITAG tagnum="85">A. Proposed Part 116_Debts Owed by Candidates and Political Committees</ITAG>The Commission has prepared this proposed new part to address, in a systematicway, several interrelated concerns regarding the creation and dispositionof election-related debts and obligations under the FECA. Proposed Part116 would explain when extensions of credit and debt settlements are treatedas contributions from the creditors, how committees should report outstandingdebts, including disputed debts, when to file a debt settlement plan andwhat information to include, and how the Commission reviews debt settlements.1. Debts Owed by Ongoing and Terminating CommitteesThe current debt settlement regulations are not expressly limited to politicalcommittees that are in the process of winding down their activities andpreparing to terminate, although the vast majority of those seeking debtsettlement are in that posture. Thus, questions have arisen as to whetherit is appropriate to permit ongoing committees, including party committees,separate segregated funds and nonconnected committees, to settle theirdebts for less than the full amount owed, particularly since some of thesecommittees may have the ability and intention to continue to solicit fundsand to engage in political activities. Consequently, the Commission seekscomments on proposed andSection; 116.2, which would expressly limit debtsettlements to terminating committees. However, this section would alsocreate a very limited exception to allow creditors of ongoing committeesto write off bad debts in the limited situation where it is demonstratedthat the ongoing committee has been essentially dormant for some time andwill not be able to pay its debts in the foreseeable future. This is notintended to serve as a routine method for ongoing committees to disposeof the debts.Under proposed andSection; 116.2, the Commission would review debt settlementplans to determine whether the committee has complied with new Part 116and to ascertain whether the proposed plan would result in an apparentviolation of the FECA or the Commission's regulations. This provision isbased on current andSection; 114.10, which provides for a similar reviewof debt settlements for potential violations. The Commission has not ``approved''or ``disapproved'' debt settlement statements in the past. Nonetheless,comments are sought as to whether specific approval or disapproval shouldbe granted to future debt settlement plans and what consequences shouldflow from such approval or disapproval, particularly in situations wherecreditors may disagree with certain aspects of the settlement plans.2. Transfers Involving Indebted CommitteesProposed andSection; 116.2 would also address situations where candidatesseek to transfer an indebted campaign committee's remaining funds to anothercampaign committee authorized by that candidate. Such transfers would notbe permitted under the proposals being published today because they wouldbe unfair to the creditors of the transferor committee and they would becontrary to the objective of encouraging political committees to pay theirjust debts.Comments are also sought on other situations involving transfers and indebtedcommittees. For example, the Commission is considering whether to expresslypermit, but not require, the forwarding of debts from previous to currentcampaign committees of the same candidate in accordance with AOs 1980-43and 1977-52. Under such an approach, the previous campaign committee wouldbe permitted to terminate after the transfer is made. The current campaigncommittee would be required to report separately the previous debts, aswell as whatever contributions it receives to pay those debts. Such contributionswould have to be aggregated with whatever contributions were previouslyreceived from the same donors for that prior election.In some cases, a subsequent campaign committee may not wish to assume theobligation of paying debts incurred by previous campaign committees ifthey are not legally required to do so. Nevertheless, the Commission isinterested in exploring ways to encourage campaign committees to pay orsettle previous campaign debts before the candidate begins making expendituresfor the next election, or before the campaign committee makes new purchasesfrom the same vendors. A related question is whether the Commission shouldallow a candidate's committee to terminate and dispose of its surplus,if the candidate has another principal compaign committee that is in debt.Conversely, should the indebted committee be permitted to settle thosedebts if it could lawfully receive a tranfer of funds from the other committeeto pay those debts in full?3. Extensions of Credit and Settlements of Debts by Commercial VendorsNew andSection; 116.3 would cover extensions of credit by incorporated andunincorporated vendors of goods and services to candidates and politicalcommittees. It would clarify that both incorporated and unincorporatedvendors may extend credit to a candidate or committee provided that thecredit is extended in the ordinary course of business on terms substantiallysimilar to those offered to non-political purchasers where the degree ofrisk and the amount of the obligation are comparable. Please note thatan extension of credit outside the commercial vendor's normal course ofits own business would continue to be impermissible unless it involvesa use of facilities or means of transportation such as that specificallypermitted by 11 CFR 114.9.This new provision would also list the factors the Commission would considerin determining whether credit was extended in the ordinary course of business.These suggested factors are intended to provide guidance so that commercialvendors and political committees may avoid situations that would resultin the making or acceptance of excessive or prohibited contributions. Oneof the proposed factors would be whether the extension of credit conformedto the usual and normal practice in the vendor's trade or industry. However,this factor may not be pertinent in cases where the vendor could show thatits own business practices are different, or where there may not be anestablished industry-wide practice. Thus, the proposed factors would notnecessarily be accorded equal weight. The Commisison requests commentson these proposed criteria and suggestions as to other criteria that shouldbe considered.Section 116.4 would address the forgiveness or settlement of campaign debtsby corporate and noncorporate commercial vendors and would explain thatsuch actions will result in the making of a contribution to the debtorcommittee unless they are commercially reasonable.The proposed regulation would also follow current andSection; 114.10(c) byexplaining when a settlement is commercially reasonable. The draft ruleswould include examples of commercially reasonable efforts that could beundertaken by the debtor candidates and committees to pay the outstandingamounts, as well as examples of commercially reasonable remedies that thevendor could pursue in appropriate cases. However, the creditor and thedebtor would not be required to undertake particular activities that arenot likely to result in the payment of the debt and the vendor would notbe required to go beyond its usual efforts to collect debts of similaramount from non-political entities. The Commission requests comments onthis approach and suggestions concerning other examples of commerciallyreasonable efforts undertaken by the candidate, the committee or the vendor.Finally, proposed andSection; 116.4(d) would state explicitly that the proposedregulations are not intended to force a commercial vendor to forgive orsettle a political debt is the vendor does not wish to do so. This wouldbe consistent with the current Commission practice of examining debt settlementstatements for indications that the creditors are in agreement with theterms of the settlement. <T3>See </T3>FEC Directive No. 3, Agenda Document andplusmin;82-110 (effectiveJuly 22, 1982).<T3>4. Advances by Committee Staff and Other Individuals</T3>Issues have arisen during the course of several compliance matters andin advisory opinion requests concerning payments by individuals, includingcampaign staff, using personal funds including personal credit cards topurchase various goods or services for political committees. <T3>See </T3>MUR 1349; and AO 1984-37. For example, such individuals haveused, or sought to use, personal funds to purchase goods and services suchas airfare, rental cars, meals, lodging, postage, office supplies, messengerservices and a variety of other election-related items with the expectationof later reimbursement by the committee. The Commission is concerned thatindividuals with sizable resources may have the ability to circumvent thecontribution limitations by paying committee expenses and not being reimbursedfor a substantial period of time.If the payments are for transportation expenses incurred by individualswhile traveling on behalf of candidates or political party committees,they would not be treated as contributions under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(8) ifthey do not exceed $1000 per candidate per election or $2000 per year forthe political committees of a political party. Moreover, personal fundsused by volunteers for usual and normal subsistence expenses incidentalto volunteer activity are not contributions under current andSection; 100.70(b)(8).However, if the payments do not fall within these exemptions, the problemis that the individuals involved have not provided goods or services tothe committee as commercial vendors. Therefore, they cannot rely on andSection;100.7(a)(4), which permits extensions of credit for an amount of time withinnormal business or trade practice. Nevertheless, these individuals mayneed to pay for unanticipated expenses before obtaining the funds fromthe committee. Consequently, the Commission is now seeking comments on draft andSection;116.5, which would allow individuals such as volunteers and paid employeesof the campaign to use personal funds, including credit cards, to pay forcertain types of expenses on behalf of candidates and political committeeswithout being considered to have made a contribution, privided they arerepaid within the time periods indicated below.Under this approach, payments from personal funds for the purchase of campaign-relatedgoods or services would not be treated as contributions if they fall withinone of the categories of payments excluded from the definition of contributionunder 11 CFR 100.7(b)(8). In addition, this proposal would state that nonexemptedpayments would be considered contributions unless two conditions are met.The payments must be for the individual's personal transportation expensesincurred while traveling on behalf of a candidate or party committee orfor the individual's usual and normal subsistence expenses incurred whiletraveling on behalf of a candidate or party committee. Secondly, reimbursementmust be obtained within sixty days for credit car transactions or thirtydays in other cases. These proposals would be consistent with the changessuggested by the Commission to 11 CFR 100.7(b)(8), regarding unreimbursedsubsistence expenses, and would also be consistent with the treatment ofcredit card transactions in the public financing regulations. <T3>See </T3>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 53 FR 35827 (September 15,1988); and 11 CFR 9035.2(a)(2).The proposal being published today is intended to provide flexibility insituations where certain individuals may find it necessary to pay personnaltravel and subsistence expenses. The Commission recognizes that the campaigncommittee may not want to provide credit cards to its field workers. Underthis approach, however, a contribution would result if the individual paysfor the transportation or subsistence expenses of others, or for othercampaign expenses such as the costs of meeting rooms or telephone services,or if reimbursement is not forthcoming within the proposed time limits.These time limits are intended to prevent individuals associated with thecampaign from financing the campaign for long periods during which thecandidate's funding may be quite limited. Comments are sought on this approachand on the appropriateness of the thirty and sixty day limits proposed.Although the draft rule does not set a maximum limit on the amount of reimbursabletransportation and subsistence costs an individual may accrue, the Commissionrequests comments on whether to establish an upper limit. Finally, commentis sought on whether this new provision should apply to all individualswho make these types of advances for candidates and committees, or whetherit should be limited to volunteers and paid campaign staff. The Commissionrecognizes that questions may also arise as to whether particular individualsare employees of or consultants to a committee.Draft andSection; 116.5 would also state that such unreimbursed paymentsmust be treated as debts, in which case they must be reported as such untilpayment or settlement occurs. In addition, the Commission's proposals wouldclarify that the individual creditors are not required to settle or forgivesuch debts if they do not wish to do so.The Commission notes that individuals may also lend funds directly to committees.Under the current regulations, such loans are contributions until repaid.11 CFR 100.7(a)(1)(i)(B). The Commission is considering whether it maybe advisable to state in proposed Part 116 that a loan must be treatedas an outstanding debt to the extent that it has not been repaid and, therefore,it would have to be included in a debt settlement plan. Language couldalso be included to clarify that such loans are contributions to the extentforgiven by the lenders.5. Salary Payments Owed to EmployeesQuestions have arisen regarding the treatment of unpaid salaries owed tocommittee staff as debts for debt settlement purposes. The current debtsettlement regulations do not address this subject. In some situations,the political committee and the campaign worker may have agreed that asalary would be paid only as funds are available. In other cases, the committeemay seek to treat the individuals as volunteers retroactively. Under section431(8) of the Act and 11 CFR 100.7(b)(3), the value of services providedby a volunteer is not a contribution.The Commission is considering adding proposed andSection; 116.6 to the regulationsto provide political committees with guidance in this area. The proposednew language would permit the committee to treat the unpaid amount as adebt owed to the employee or as volunteer services under 11 CFR 100.7(b)(3),provided the employee agrees in writing to being considered a volunteer.This decision could be made at any time. If the amount is treated as adebt, it would have to be reported as such under current andSection; 104.11and included in any debt settlement plan filed under proposed andSection;116.7. Although proposed andSection; 116.6 would not treat unpaid salaryobligations as contributions, comments are requested as to whether thereare situations where it would be advisable to do so.6. Debt Settlement Plans Filed by Terminating Committees and CommissionReviewProposed andSection; 116.7 would contain guidelines concerning the submissionand review of comprehensive debt settlement plans by terminating committees.Under andSection; 116.7(a), a debt settlement plan would have to be filedby an indebted terminating committee after it has reached settlements withall remaining creditors but before it has paid whatever amounts were agreedto in those settlements. In comparison, the current rules allow committeesto file debt settlement requests as they reach agreements with variouscreditors. The current approach has raised questions as to how a committeeintends to handle debts owed to other creditors, particularly when thecommittee has insufficient funds to pay these amounts and limited fundraisingprospects. Consequently, the proposed rules would require the submissionof a single settlement plan indicating how the political committee intendsto handle all of its debts and dispose of its remaining assets and cashon hand, and how it plans to obtain whatever additional amounts may beneeded to pay its creditors under the plan. Thus, the Commission wouldpostpone review of a committee's debt settlements until the committee hasreached agreements with every creditor and is ready to terminate. Commentsare sought on whether it would be advisable to require the filing of adebt settlement statement within a set period of time after all settlementshave been reached, and if so, what the appropriate deadline should be.Under this proposal creditors would no longer have the option of filingdebt settlement statements. <T3>Compare </T3>current 11 CFR 114.10. Comments are requested as to whetherthis may present difficulties for creditors wishing to write off bad debtsbefore the debtor committee is ready to terminate.Paragraph (b) of proposed andSection;116.7 would clarify that debts owedto the United States could not be settled except as permitted pursuantto applicable federal law, and that Title 26 repayments and civil penaltiesunder Title 2 must be paid in full.Under draft andSection;116.7(c), a debt settlement plan filed by an indebtedcandidate or committee would have to include a signed affidavit from eachcreditor evidencing agreement to the terms of the settlement of the debtowed to that creditor. The creditors would also be able to submit writtenstatements supporting or opposing settlements offered to other creditors.Generally, since the Commission does not have the authority to waive reportingrequirements, if any creditor refuses to accept the settlement, the politicalcommittee would not be able to file a debt settlement plan, would not beable to terminate, and would therefore be required to continue reportingits debate pursuant to andSection; 104.11. The Commission realizes, however,that a political committee acting in good faith may encounter a creditorwho absolutely refuses to settle when offered the same terms and conditionsas other creditors, thereby preventing review of the entire debt settlementplan. Comment is sought as to whether committees faced with this situationshould be allowed to submit their debt settlement plans for review, includinga statement outlining their good faith efforts. The Commission is consideringwhether in such situations it may be appropriate for the Commission tosuspend the reporting requirements pursuant to 11 CFR 102.4 after havingdetermined that the committee did make a good faith attempt to reach asettlement.The proposals being published today would also clarify the factors theCommission may consider in reviewing debt settlement plans. Most of thesefactors have been drawn from FEC Directive No. 3 regarding debt settlementprocedures. Listing these factors in the new rules would enable politicalcommittees and their creditors to better understand how the Commissionevaluates proposed debt settlements.In the past, the Commission has not attempted to influence the indebtedcommittee's decisions as to which creditors to include in a settlementagreement or as to the amount or percentage of debt to be forgiven. Theproposed rules would require committees to include all debts in their settlementplans, but would give committees broad discretion in deciding how muchto pay to each creditor. However, the Commission would be able to considerwhether debts owed to the candidate received more favorable treatment thanother campaign obligations. Since the proposed rules would not preventcommittees from treating different creditors unequally, suggestions arerequested as to whether and how to encourage committees to pay approximatelythe same percentage of each outstanding debt on similar terms. Commentsare also requested as to whether an indebted committee should be expectedto justify different settlement amounts and percentages for different creditors.The Commission is also considering whether to establish mandatory or suggestedpriorities for the settlement of debts owed to different categories ofcreditors, or whether to require committees to adhere to the prioritiesset out in the Federal Bankruptcy Code. <T3>See </T3>11 U.S.C. 507. These possibilities raise the question of whetherthe Commission should approve or disapprove debt settlements on the basisof such priorities. The Commission notes that implementation of prioritiescould create conflicts with decisions made by federal bankruptcy courtsin cases brought by indebted political committees or their creditors. Nevertheless,the FECA grants the Commission authority to establish procedures to determinethe insolvency of political committees, to liquidate the assets of insolventcommittees for the reduction of outstanding debts, and to terminate insolventcommittees after liquidation. 2 U.S.C. 433(d).Thus, the Commission is seeking comments as to what its role should bein this area and whether insolvent committees should be permitted to seekdischarges in bankruptcy prior to submission of debt settlement plans forCommission review. Although in the past the Commission has reviewed debtsettlements where committees have sought liquidation under Chapter 7, thereorganization of a political committee under Chapter 11 may present differentconsiderations. For example, such a reorganization may allow the committeeto continue its political activities while restructuring its debts, therebyobtaining an advantage over other committees that are committed to payingtheir bills on time or in full. The Commission is also concerned that reorganizationsmay present opportunities for the committee to accept prohibited or excessivecontributions. Finally, Chapter 11 reorganizations may not be entirelyconsistent with the Commission's proposals to limit debt settlements toterminating committees.The debt settlement proposals set out in andSection; 116.7 contemplate thatonce the Commission has finished reviewing a debt settlement plan, thecommittee will liquidate its remaining assets and pay its creditors sothat it may terminate as soon as possible. The Commission is consideringwhether committees should be required to terminate within a specified periodof time, such as thirty or sixty days. Comments are also sought as to whetherterminating committees should be permitted to make contributions or expendituresduring this period just prior to termination. The concern is that thistype of activity would drain resources already committed to paying pastcreditors.7. Creditors' Forgiveness of Debts Owed by Ongoing Committees and CommissionReviewProposed section 116.8 would set out conditions under which creditors wouldbe able to forgive debts owed by committees not intending to terminate.For the reasons stated above, the Commission does not favor allowing ongoingcommittees to settle debts with creditors if those committees have theability and intention to continue fundraising for election-related purposes.Consequently, this proposed rule would only allow creditors to forgivean ongoing committee's debts if either the creditor is unable to locatethe indebted committee or the committee meets certain conditions showingthat it is essentially defunct and clearly unable to pay its bills. Thisproposed section also contemplates Commission review of the creditor'sactions and the proposed forgiveness to determine whether the requirementsof new Part 116 have been satisfied and whether the forgiveness would resultin an apparent violation of the Act or the regulations. Comments are soughton this approach.8. Disputed Debts Another issue that sometimes arises involves disputed debts owed by eitherongoing or terminating committees. In some cases, there may be no agreementas to the amount or even the existence of the debt. For this reason, thecommittee may not want to report the debt to avoid acknowledging it. Inother situations there may be a bona fide dispute regarding the value ofthe goods or services received, or the vendor's compliance with the termsof the contract or the vendor's authority to undertake certain actions.Although the Commission's reporting regulations appear to require disclosureof all debts and obligations, the rules do not explain how to report disputeddebts. Committees may be reluctant to list such debts on their reportsbecause they wish to avoid jeopardizing their legal position with regardto the dispute. However, the failure to disclose such information is notconsistent with the FECA's goal of achieving full disclosure of campaignfinances. To address these concerns, the Commission is considering promulgating newandSection;116.9, which would apply to disputed debts involving both terminatingand ongoing committees. It would create a distinction for reporting purposesbetween situations in which the committee has received some goods or services,whether or not to the committee's satisfaction, and those situations inwhich nothing of value has been provided. This proposal would require committeesto report a disputed debt only when they have actually received somethingof value pursuant to the agreement between the parties, thereby ensuringdisclosure whenever there is the potential for a contribution to result.However, proposed andSection;116.9 would allow committees to indicate ontheir reports that they dispute the existence or the amount of the debtand that by noting the dispute they have not admitted to owing the amountclaimed. This would permit the committee to disclose the possible obligationwhile preserving their rights in the dispute, and would be consistent with11 CFR 9035.1(a)(2). Thus, reporting would be postponed only when nothinghas been provided and only the creditor believes a debt exists. With regard to terminating committees that have been unable to resolvedisputed debts, the proposed rules would require such committees to statein the debt settlement plan what amount, if any, they propose paying creditorsto resolve the disputes. These committees would not be expected to includestatements from the creditors agreeing to the settlements. The Commissionwould review these proposals as part of the debt settlement plans. Commentsare requested on this approach. 9. Issues Concerning Debts Owned by Publicly-Funded Presidential CampaignCommittees The current debt settlement regulations at 11 CFR 114.10 do not differentiatebetween debts owed by presidential campaign committees accepting publicfunding under 26 U.S.C. Chapters 95 and 96, and debts owed by other politicalcommittees. Consequently, the Commission has handled debt settlement requestssubmitted by presidential committees in accordance with the proceduresset out in FEC Directive No. 3. Current andSection;9035.1(a)(2) contemplatesthat such debts may be settled and that a settlement does not affect thecandidate's spending limits unless the lower amount represents a reasonablesettlement of a dispute as to what was owed. Although proposed Part 116would continue this approach, the question arises as to whether publiclyfunded committees should be permitted to settle debts, and if so, whetherhigher standards should be used to evaluate their settlement plans. Anotherissue concerns the timing of debt settlements filed by presidential committees.If the Commission continues to permit such debt settlements, should thePresidential committees submit their proposed settlement plans for Commissionreview as soon as feasible, or should they be able to wait until the Commission'saudit process has been completed? Questions were also raised in AO 1988-5 as to whether a publicly fundedcommittee may use its funds to make loans or contributions to the candidate'sprevious publicly funded committee which is still in debt. The Commissionconcluded that such a payment would not constitute a qualified campaignexpense pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.4 and would not be includible in the candidate'sstatement of net outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 9034.5 uponthe candidate's withdrawal from the race. However, the subsequent presidentialcampaign committee was permitted to treat part of its cash balance as excesscampaign funds available to retire the previous committee's debts oncethe Commission's audit and review were completed and the committee hassatisfied whatever repayment obligations or possible penalties it may owe.Accordingly, comments are requested as to whether the Commission's debtsettlement rules, or the public financing rules should be revised to reflectthis decision. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Proposed Amendments to Other Regulations </ITAG>The Commission is considering several possible conforming amendments toandSection;andSection;104.11 and 113.1(e) that may be necessary to bring thesesections into conformity with proposed new Part 116. Accordingly, the Commissionseeks comments on several possible revisions discussed below. The Commissionalso notes that the cross references in andSection;andSection;100.7(a)(4) and104.3(d) to the current debt settlement provisions in andSection;114.10 willneed to be revised. 1. Definition of Excess Campaign Funds Section 113.1(e) of the regulations implements the statutory provisionsregarding permissible uses of excess campaign funds. 2 U.S.C. 439a. TheCommission is proposing to amend the definition of ``excess campaign funds''so that a candidate's campaign committee could not declare excess campaignfunds until after the campaign has ended and the committee has determinedthat it is not in a net debt situation. This proposal is intended to ensurethat campaign funds will be used to pay for goods and services providedto the campaign. The Commission is concerned that under the current rulesand advisory opinions, it is possible to declare excess campaign fundsat any time, and to use those excess amounts to form a new campaign committee,or for a variety of political or non-political purposes, at the expenseof the <T3>bona fide</T3> creditors of the previous committee. Accordingly, commentsare sought on this proposed amendment. 2. Continuous Reporting of Debts and Obligations Section 104.11 implements section 434(b)(8) of the Act by requiring thatall debts and obligations owed by or to a political committee be continuouslyreported until extinguished, and by requiring the disclosure of settlementsfor less than the reported value or amount of the debt. Under andSection;104.11(b),debts of $500 or less must be reported either at the time of payment orno later than sixty days after they are incurred, which ever is earlier.However, obligations exceeding $500 must be reported as of the time ofthe transaction. Comments are requested as to whether andSection;104.11(b)should be revised to more clearly explain that debts exceeding $500 mustbe reported when they are incurred, and must be disclosed on subsequentreports as outstanding, and that payments must also be reported. The Commission is also reevaluating the scope of andSection;104.11(b). Currently,for amounts not exceeding $500, the committee must disclose any ``debt,obligation or other promise to make an expenditure.'' However, for amountsover $500, disclosure is required for ``any loan, debt or obligation.''The Commissioin's policy has been to treat these categories as the same.Accordingly, the Commission is considering clarifying this policy by makingthe language of the two provisions consistent with each other. Commentsare requested as to whether both of these provisions should be revisedto cover all ``debts and obligations, including loans and written contracts,promises or agreements to make expenditures,'' which would be consistentwith the definition of expenditure at 2 U.S.C. 431(9). Several other questions concerning the reporting of debts and obligationscould be addressed. For example, the reporting rules do not indicate whento report an employee's salary if the work is performed in one reportingperiod and the payment is made in another. Another situation that couldbe addressed concerns committees that may not know the exact amount ofthe obligation incurred during the reporting period until the vendor submitsa bill in a later reporting period. This is particularly common with regardto telephone services and contingent fee arrangements. To ensure adequatedisclosure, the Commission is considering whether it needs to be made clearerthat the estimated cost should be reported as a debt on Schedule D witha notation that this amount is an estimate. When the committee receivesthe bill, it could either amend the previous report or note the changeon a subsequent Schedule D. In some situations, the activity will alsorepresent an in-kind contribution to a specific candidate. Thus, the estimatedamount would also have to be included as a memo entry on Schedule B andadjustments would be made once the bill is received and paid. The detailedsummary page would also reflect these figures and the changes. Commentsare requested on whether this approach needs to be clarified.Finally, andSection;104.11 could be amended to clarify when the obligationto continuously report ends. In most situations, the disclosure requirementends once the bill is paid in full or the Commission has completed reviewof the debt settlement. However, a question arises as to whether a committeeshould also be permitted to report a debt as extinguished if the creditorhas gone out of business. If this is allowed, the Commission recognizesthat it may be necessary to require committees to demonstrate that thecreditor no longer exists or that they have been diligent in trying tolocate the creditor. Another issue concerns debts that are no longer legallyenforceable against the committee under the applicable statute of limitations.The Commission is considering whether, in some cases, such debts shouldbe treated as extinguished, thereby enabling the committees to terminatetheir reporting obligations. However, some committees may wish to makeefforts to pay part or all of the amount owed, even after they are no longerlegally obligated to do so. Comments are therefore requested as to whethercommittees should have the option to report debts as extinguished oncethey are no longer legally enforceable under the appropriate statute oflimitations. The Commission notes that his approach would not be appropriatein situations where the credit was extended beyond a commercially reasonablelength of time or where the creditor failed to take commercially reasonablesteps to obtain payment.The Commission welcomes comments on proposed new Par 116, the conformingamendments, and the issues raised in this Notice. <ITAG tagnum="20">Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (RegulatoryFlexibility Act)</ITAG>The attached proposed rules, if promulgated, will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
