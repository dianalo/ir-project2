Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama, adding, ``there wasnever a chance to have him handed over to us.''   ``We reviewed all the information and I don't see anything nowthat would have made me make a different decision then,'' Bush toldreporters as he emerged from Walter Reed Army Medical Center afterminor surgery on his finger.   He said he still wants to see Noriega removed from power. ThePanamanian military leader faces federal drug charges in Florida.   Bush offered a defense of his handling of the coup as two topadministration officials were called by lawmakers to answerquestions in closed session about the affair.   ``I'm not just being stubborn, but as I look at all theinformation I wouldn't have made a different decision then,'' Bushsaid.   Noting the criticism by many in Congress that he didn't use the12,000 U.S. military personnel in Panama to help rebelliousofficers of the Panamanian Defense Forces in the short-lived revolton Tuesday, Bush said he knew that some wanted him ``to unleash thefull military to go in and get Noriega.''   He said he could have ``gone to general quarters but that is notprudent'' under the circumstances.   The president said he still wants to see Noriega removed frompower, but ``there was never a chance to have him handed over tous'' during the attempted coup.   The vigorous public defense by Bush and his aides of theadministration's actions contrasted with private acknowledgementsby admininistration officials that the United States was guilty ofshortcomings in intelligence matters and other areas.   ``I hope we will have learned some things from this and be alittle better next time,'' one senior official, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said Thursday.   Bush was asked today about reports that the administration hadan information gap during the coup attempt and was in a state ofconfusion due to conflicting and garbled reports from Panama.   The president said he had been engaged in ``almost a runningmeeting'' on the matter throughout Tuesday. As to whether he hadsufficient information and intelligence, he said, ``I don't feel Ican factually answer that.''   Bush was asked whether Panamanians who want to make future coupattempts against Noriega could have any assurance that he mightback them militarily.   He did not answer directly but said, ``I would not rule out anyoption, but you have to look at the facts. You have to keep in mindthe lives of American citizens ... but I wouldn't rule that out.''   He added that his decision not to use force in this case wasbecause ``it wasn't warranted under the existing circumstances.''   ``The commander-in-chief must have the lives of Americancitizens foremost in mind when making such a decision,'' Bush said.   He said ``it's simply not true'' that the insurgents offered toturn Noriega over to U.S. authorities.   As the administration mounted its defense, the nation's topmilitary leaders went before Senate committees investigating theadministration's actions, including whether rebel troops soughtU.S. support while the uprising was in progress.   The Intelligence and Armed Services committees met in closedsession with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Army Gen. ColinPowell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to press for thedetails.   After the three-hour session, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., quotedCheney and Powell as saying they ``basically ... would not havechanged their decision and recommendations to the president, basedon what they know today.''   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman,said he already was having difficulty because the White House wasresisting authorizing the CIA to give his panel a detailedchronology of events.   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush``feels that we did the best we could with the informationavailable and he feels he made the right decisions.''   Even with the benefit of hindsight, the president wouldn't doanything differently, Fitzwater said, contradicting a statement aday earlier by the senior administration official.   For the first time, the administration publicly pinpointed thewife of coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi as the person who tippedoff U.S. officials about the planned coup. She contacted U.S.officials last Sunday, Fitzwater said, disputing a Wall StreetJournal report that she had made contact three weeks ago.   The Journal said Adella Bonilla de Giroldi on Sunday nightarranged for a meeting between her husband and two officials fromthe CIA. It said the CIA had confidence in the rebels but the U.S.military did not.   Fitzwater backpedaled from an earlier statement that the onlyadvance contact was through third parties. He said U.S. officialsalso were in touch with Giroldi himself on Sunday. U.S. officialsbelieve Giroldi was killed after the coup attempt.   Discussing the Senate investigation, Boren said Thursday,``We're going to get to the bottom of this,'' including thequestion of whether Panamanian rebels offered to release Noriega toU.S. officials during the four- or five-hour period they had him incustody.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., disputed the administration'sassertion that the rebels refused to release Noriega, saying,``They (the rebels) told the U.S. officers that they were holdingNoriega captive, and requested U.S. assistance to take custody ofNoriega and remove him to the United States.''   However, Defense Secretary Cheney said the rebels refused in a``face-to-face contact'' with a U.S. military officer to turn overNoriega during the coup attempt.   A variety of officials said Tuesday's coup effort was doomed bya series of false assumptions and mistaken judgments by the rebelsas well as by the American forces' lack of flexibility.   One U.S. official said American forces in Panama were preparedfor any contingency _ ``from the maximum all the way to theminimum.'' But the official said constraints were placed on Gen.Maxwell Thurman of the Southern Command, who assumed his duties inPanama just two days before the insurrection.   The senior administration official, asked if the White Housewished it had done things differently, replied, ``Yeah, a fewthings.   ``This is our first bloodletting, if you will, first real timeof kind of a crisis operation,'' the official said. ``And everyadministration has a shakedown in one way or another and we'velearned some things about our operation that we need to improve.And we'll improve them.''</TEXT></DOC>
