It isan excellent medium for heat storage at the bottom of the pond and, whenconvection is suppressed leaving only conductive loss of heat to thesurface, it is a surprisingly good insulator which is also remarkablytransparent to solar radiation. Convection is suppressed in the centralgradient zone by an increase in concentration of salt (sodium and/ormagnesium chloride) with depth, such that hotter water below is alwaysheavier than cooler water above. Designers of salt-gradient ponds haveborrowed extensively from earlier work in other fields, especially oceanography,concerning the absorption of solar radiation in salt water and double-diffusivethermo - saline stability of the salt water system. In a number of respects,and for a variety of reasons, this has turned out to be inaccurate ormisleading.</TEXT></DOC>
