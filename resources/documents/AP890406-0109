A lawyer for the families of the victims called Wednesday'sdecision ``inconceivable.''   The Oct. 29 slayings had prompted four days of student riots inCaracas and elsewhere in which news reports said at least oneperson was killed and at least 57 were wounded. Church groups andhuman rights organizations worldwide sent letters of protest to thegovernment.   The soldiers had claimed the fishermen had been Colombianguerrillas killed in a firefight, but nearby villagers and twosurvivors of the attack denied the claim and said the fishermenwere ambushed while on a Sunday picnic.   An autopsy showed that many of the dead men had been shot in theback of the head at close range.   The court president, Gen. Daniel de Jesus Palacios, said histribunal had decided Wednesday to overturn a lower military court'sprevious decision in January to jail the men, part of amilitary-police border task force.   A lawyer for the families of the dead men, Fabian Chacon,criticized the ruling.   ``There is an unmasked intention on the part of the court tofavor the men on trial, which goes to show that in Venezuela thereare obstacles and structures that make justice impossible,'' Chacontold reporters outside the judge's chambers.   The 19 policemen and soldiers had been held in the city of SanCristobal, about 400 miles southwest of Caracas.   The lower military court had ordered their arrest and reversedanother court that had ordered the arrest of two survivingfishermen for ``military rebellion.''   The two survivors, Wolmer Pinilla and Jose Arias, then fled toMexico, where they received political asylum.   Villagers of El Amparo denied the men were guerrillas, and saidthey were all fishermen out for a Sunday picnic when they wereambushed by the soldiers.   The military court's latest decision frees the imprisoned menand sends the case back to where it stood before the decision toimprison them, said de Jesus.   It was unclear whether Pinilla and Arias, who later returned toVenezuela, would now be guilty of ``military rebellion'' and liablefor arrest again.   Military rebellion is often a term used to justify detainingpeople without charges, according to the human rights group AmnestyInternational.   The decision follows widespread riots in February overgovernment economic reforms that left at least 270 dead by officialestimates. Unofficial sources say that death toll was as high as2,000.</TEXT></DOC>
