Six environmental proposals offered by Exxon shareholders-- and opposed by management -- failed to pass, winning farless than a majority of the nonbinding vote. But the measuresgarnered a larger share of votes than expected, and more thanfirst-time proposals usually receive. They includedinitiatives to have Exxon make public an &quot;environmentalaudit,&quot; press on with its cleanup in Alaska and reduceozone-damaging carbon-dioxide emissions at all of itsfacilities.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is just the beginning,&quot; said Brent Blackwelder, vicepresident of Friends of the Earth. &quot;It signals the firstserious attempt to put strong environmental pressures on abig oil company.&quot;   With yesterday's results as a springboard, environmentalgroups hope to carry their demands for support beyond themunicipal and state pension funds that helped them at Exxonto other institutional investors, such as banks and insurers.&quot;We're going to keep the heat on Exxon and other companies,&quot;said Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation,the nation's largest conservation organization.   The 4 1/2-hour meeting, which the environmental communityhad been anticipating and Exxon fearing for weeks, proved tobe subdued and orderly, with few of the promised picketsoutside the big convention center here. Unlike last year'sraucous gathering, in which shareholders queued up to gaincontrol of microphones, yesterday many microphones sat unusedby the crowd of more than 1,800.   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl tempered his typicallyfeisty repartee and struck a conciliatory tone with most whochallenged him. In fact, he agreed to try to grant a requestby Mr. Hair, one of his most vocal critics. &quot;I would bepleased if we could arrange&quot; a joint trip to Alaska with theenvironmentalist to examine Exxon's progress in the secondyear of its oil-spill cleanup effort, Mr. Rawl said.   When one shareholder demanded his resignation, Mr. Rawlsaid simply, &quot;Thank you. I appreciate it. Next.&quot;   One notable disruption to Mr. Rawl's calm came whenquestioned about Exxon's resistance to double-hulled oiltankers, which are supposed to be spill-resistant. &quot;What areyou telling me to do? Spend $125 million?&quot; Mr. Rawl demanded,referring to the projected cost of building just one suchtanker for use in Alaska. &quot;Your time is up,&quot; he said andcalled on another shareholder, only to discover a formeremployee proposing to give up part of his dividends tofinance such vessels. Mr. Rawl told the shareholder hedoubted many others in the room felt that way.   Before the meeting, Mr. Blackwelder said environmentalgroups believed a tally of 5% to 7% of the votes cast wouldbe a dynamic showing. All six shareholder proposals picked up5.7% or better, with two exceeding 9%.   Though these numbers may sound small, they are actuallysubstantial for first-time proposals -- especially in lightof management's opposition. Shareholder initiatives rarelyexceed 5% when first proposed, according to Peg O'Hara,director of corporate governance at the InvestorResponsibility Research Center in Washington, D.C.   Even if the proposals presented to Exxon had won amajority, the company wouldn't have been forced to take anyaction since the vote was nonbinding. But in view of theshowing, Exxon's board may review its opposition to some ofthe proposals. &quot;These {votes} are not cavalier,&quot; says WilliamHowell, chairman of J.C. Penney andamp; Co. and an Exxon directorsince 1982. &quot;We listen. I don't look and say, `Gosh, it'sonly 3%.' &quot;   Some of the proposals probably will show up in Exxon'sproxy next year because all attained the 3% thresholdnecessary to be included again, according to Securities andExchange Commission regulations.   Several Exxon officials were surprised at the showing,though they suggested that in spirit they weren't opposed tosome of the ideas. At board meetings, there was &quot;fulldiscussion&quot; of these issues, one director said.   Exxon fully supports a list of principles recently adoptedby the American Petroleum Institute, some of which are verysimilar to the shareholder proposals, one senior Exxonexecutive added.   But fear of pending litigation was a major factor in theboard's refusal to endorse any of the proposals, Mr. Rawl andsome other directors said. The oil giant faces more than 150civil suits as well as a criminal action by the state ofAlaska over the oil spill in Prince William Sound. That hasmade the company's senior managers leery of taking any standthat could be used against them.   Significantly, Exxon's 15 directors won re-election withmore than 98% of the votes cast, an extremely strong showinggiven that so many votes were cast against management on theenvironmental proposals. &quot;I'm surprised {Mr.} Rawl garneredthat much support,&quot; said Doug Cogan, another official at theWashington-based investor center. &quot;But many of the holderswho were most upset with management have already sold theirstock.&quot;   Receiving the highest votes were the proposals calling fora renewed cleanup effort in Alaska and for a report on thecompany's progress in achieving the so-called ValdezPrinciples, a 10-point environmental agenda for corporations.Many companies already have agreed to provide such reports,or so-called environmental audits. The cleanup proposal won9.4% of the vote; the request for an audit, 9.5%   The proposal calling for reduced emissions of carbondioxide, which are said to contribute to global warming, got6.2% of the vote. Other environmental proposals called for asupplement to the annual report disclosing hazardousemissions (5.7%); reduction of toxic chemicals emitted fromExxon facilities (6.5%) and the establishment of aboard-level environmental affairs committee (5.7%).   For some time now, Exxon's outside directors have beenconducting their own investigation into who bearsresponsibility for the Alaskan spill, but in an interview atthe meeting, Jess Hay, the director leading the probe, saidcompletion was still four or five months away. Theinvestigation could find fault with the actions of seniormanagement as well as Exxon employees directly involved, suchas Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood. Mr. Hay declined tocharacterize the findings thus far.   Initially, directors had expected to complete the studylast fall. &quot;But it became much more involved,&quot; Mr. Hay said.&quot;There were more rabbits to chase down trails than wethought.&quot;   Other outside directors showed no sign of wavering intheir support for senior management. Asked whether Mr. Rawlwas doing a good job, Mr. Howell, the J.C. Penney executive,responded, &quot;Absolutely. The tough have to get tougher inthese times.&quot;   The environmental focus of the meeting allowed someholders with homes near Exxon facilities to complain tomanagement about toxic emissions and waste disposal that theyclaim is ruining their health.   One woman who lives two blocks from the company's Baytown,Texas, refinery said she was concerned over the high levelsof cancer among children there and that queries over plantemissions had gone unanswered. Another woman complained oftoxic materials dumped dangerously close to her home. Mr.Rawl said he would direct Exxon officials to look into bothcases.</TEXT></DOC>
