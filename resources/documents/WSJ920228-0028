Members of the Network Reliability Council, appointed bythe Federal Communications Commission after a rash of phoneoutages last year, will advise the agency by the end of Aprilwhether FCC reporting standards for phone outages should betightened.</LP><TEXT>   Panel members didn't indicate what they will recommend;many expressed concerns that problems have been overstated,saying that U.S. networks remain the most dependable in theworld. Paul Henson, chairman of the council and formerchairman of United Telecommunications Inc., acknowledged&quot;some reliability problems&quot; but said &quot;media detractors&quot;exaggerate them.   But Sam Ginn, chairman of San Francisco-based PacificTelesis Group, said that despite fewer outages, modernnetwork design and technology result in &quot;enormous publicimpact when we do have outages, and if you think about thefuture, that is going to get worse.&quot;   Bert Roberts, chief executive officer of MCICommunications Corp., said many problems aren't high-tech.&quot;The number of fiber cuts is staggering,&quot; he said, addingthat neither state nor federal laws address the problem ofcontractors and others who dig without first checking thelocation of utility lines.   The Network Reliability Council is directed to considerwhether stricter reporting requirements are needed,especially for disruptions to public safety or healthcommunications, such as 911 service or airportcommunications.</TEXT></DOC>
