Late in New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6041 marksand 147.83 yen, down from 1.6120 marks and 149.15 yen lateFriday. Meanwhile, the British pound rose to $1.8470 from$1.8375 on Friday.</LP><TEXT>   At its nadir yesterday, the dollar traded at 1.6023 marks,its lowest level since Jan. 4, 1988, when the dollar brieflytouched 1.5615 marks, its lowest level since the modernexchange rate-system was established after World War II.   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quotedat 147.65 yen; it closed in Tokyo Monday at 148.60 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6058marks, down from Tokyo's Monday close of 1.6128 marks.   &quot;We feel {the dollar} has got further to go down,&quot; saidJoe Scott-Plummer, joint managing director at Martin CurrieLtd., an Edinburgh, Scotland, money manager.   Analysts said the U.S. currency is caught in a vise.Interest rates in Europe and Japan have been rising as majorforeign economies -- especially those of West Germany andJapan -- are booming. At the same time, a softening U.S.economy is raising the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates.   &quot;It seems we're heading into a recession or a moderateslowdown, which would imply lower U.S. interest rates,&quot; saidIan Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.&quot;In conjunction with that, it appears that Europe --particularly Germany -- is on a roll with a booming economyand opportunity for investment.&quot;   Lower U.S. rates, combined with higher rates overseas,generally hurt the dollar by reducing its allure tointernational investors and speculators. The dollar is alsoburdened by big U.S. budget and trade deficits.   Although U.S. stocks and bonds rose yesterday, analystsand money managers warned that the weakening U.S. currency isdamping foreign investors' appetites for dollar-denominatedsecurities. Foreign investors have never held the same swayover the U.S. stock market as they have over the bond market,but Japanese and British investors at times do influence U.S.share prices.   Traders said there was scant buying of U.S. bonds byJapanese investors yesterday. This comes as other foreigninvestors are generally shunning U.S. markets in favor ofeither high-yielding fixed-income securities abroad orforeign stock markets.   In the first quarter, foreign investors dumped a net $3.3billion of U.S. stocks and $900 million of American bonds,according to the Security Industry Association. The Japanesealone unloaded $700 million of U.S. shares and $3.9 billionof U.S. Treasury securities. Analysts say that evidencepoints to the trend continuing in the second quarter.   &quot;All the Japanese money that had been heading into theU.S. is either heading for Europe or remaining at home inJapan,&quot; said Mr. Spence.   Yesterday, the dollar in intraday trading also tumbled toa 30-month low against the Swiss franc and nearly a 20-monthlow against the British pound.   For Americans, a weakening currency is a double-edgedsword. It can help to lower the U.S. trade deficit byreducing the prices of U.S. exports while boosting the pricesof foreign imports purchased by American consumers. At thesame time, however, higher import prices contribute to U.S.inflation by allowing domestic companies that compete withforeigners to raise prices.   If the dollar fell far enough, it could also make it moreexpensive for the U.S. to finance its budget deficit. That'sbecause foreign investors would demand higher yields onTreasury securities to compensate for the weakened dollar.Those higher rates, in turn, might damage U.S. economicgrowth.   While the dollar has been weakening for several weeks,traders and analysts say that the U.S. currency was hurt bylast Friday's Commerce Department report that the U.S.economy grew at an anemic annual inflation-adjusted rate of1.2% in the second quarter -- down from 1.7% in the firstquarter.   Traders saw the report as evidence that U.S. interestrates will fall further and the dollar with them. Bycontrast, the West German and Japanese economies each zoomedat annual rates of 10.4% in the first quarter.   But it is the rising gap between U.S. and foreign interestrates that is the biggest factor driving down the dollar,analysts said. In the past year, yields on three-monthEurodollar deposits -- dollar deposits held offshore -- havefallen to 7.88% from 8.55%. Meanwhile, yields on equivalentmark deposits have jumped to 8.24% from 6.84%, and those onequivalent yen deposits have climbed to 7.69% from 5.32%.   &quot;It's the expectation that U.S. rates will continue to golower in the second half of the year, and we expect rates inGermany and Japan to rise,&quot; said Nigel Randell, aninternational economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London. &quot;Withthat as a background, there is little reason to be buying thedollar aggressively.&quot;   There is an even greater gap between U.S. and Britishinterest rates; threemonth Eurosterling rates currently standat 15.08%, up from 13.75% a year ago.   &quot;With something like a 15% yield, you can't go wrong&quot; withsterling, said George Kuster, a portfolio manager at Gulf andamp;Occidental Investments S.A. in Geneva, who is also buyingFrench bonds, Swiss franc bonds issued by foreigncorporations and German time deposits. Mr. Kuster said thatonly 3% to 5% of the portfolios he manages are indollar-denominated investments.   Japan's money supply is expanding at a rapid annual rateof 12.6%. And many analysts predict that West Germaninflation will grow along with the increased expendituresassociated with the monetary union between East and WestGermany.   Mr. Randell predicts that Japan will raise its officialdiscount rate -- which the central bank charges on loans tofinancial institutions -- by 1/2 or 3/4 percentage point fromits current 5.25% level &quot;over the next couple of months.&quot; Healso forecasts that after German rates remain stable for afew months, West Germany will push them higher in October.   Higher rates abroad would mean more pressure on the dollarand could even prompt the Federal Reserve to prop up thedollar by raising U.S. rates.   The weakening dollar has made Martin Currie, the Edinburghmoney-management company, pessimistic about buying U.S.stocks. For its non-dollar based investors, the company'sU.S. stock holdings currently represent about 80% to 85% ofwhat they would be if the firm's portfolios were weighted toreflect the value of the U.S. market relative to the rest ofthe world. That's down from roughly a 135% weighting sixmonths ago. The capitalization of the U.S. stock market isabout 34% of the world's market, according to Morgan StanleyCapital International.   Said Mr. Scott-Plummer of Martin Currie: &quot;While we aren'tbearish on the U.S. stock market, we feel any returns {there}could be eliminated by the weakness of the U.S. dollar.&quot;   Roberto Bianchi, a first vice president at Union Bank ofSwitzerland in Zurich, noted that investors who were sellingdollars yesterday were buying mostly high-yielding currenciessuch as the pound, Spanish peseta and Italian lira. Hepredicted that in the next week or two, the dollar couldtumble another 2% to 3% against the mark, bring it to itsrecord lows against the German currency.   And the Martin Currie company sees the dollar falling anadditional 7% against the yen to 135 yen over the next fiveto six months.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for Augustdelivery settled at $367.80 an ounce, down 20 cents.Estimated volume was a heavy five million ounces.   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at$368.55 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
