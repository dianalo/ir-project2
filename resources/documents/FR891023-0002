I. duPontde Nemours andamp; Co., Wilmington, DE 19898, proposing that andSection; 177.2450<T3>Polyamide-imide resins </T3>(21 CFR 177.2450) be amended to providefor the safe use of a polyamide-imide resin produced by the condensationreaction of benzoyl chloride-3,4-dicarboxylic anhydride and 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamineas components of articles intended for repeated use in contact with food.FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, reviewed the safetyof both the additive and the starting materials used to manufacture theadditive. The polyamide-imide resin may contain minute amounts of 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamineas an impurity from its production. This chemical has been shown to causecancer in test animals. Residual amounts of reactants and byproducts, suchas 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine, are commonly found as contaminantsin chemical products, including food additives. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety </ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes thatthe additive is safe for that use. The concept of safety embodied in theFood Additives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative historyof the provision: ``Safety requires proof of a reasonable certainty thatno harm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not_andcannot_require proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will resultunder any conceivable circumstance.'' (H. Rept. 2284, 85th Cong., 2d Sess.4 (1958)). This definition of safety has been incorporated into FDA's foodadditive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)). The anticancer or Delaney clauseof the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C.348(c)(3)(A))) provides further that no food additive shall be deemed tobe safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal.In the past, FDA has often refused to approve the use of an additive thatcontained or was suspected of containing even minor amounts of a carcinogenicchemical, even though the additive as a whole had not been shown to causecancer. The agency now believes, however, that developments in scientifictechnology and experience with risk assessment procedures make it possiblefor FDA to establish the safety of additives that contain carcinogenicchemicals but that have not themselves been shown to cause cancer.In the preamble to the final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Green No.6, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 2, 1982 (47 FR 14138), FDA explainedthe basis for approving the use of a color additive that had not been shownto cause cancer, even though it contains a carcinogenic impurity. Sincethat decision, FDA has approved the use of other color additives and foodadditives on the same basis. An additive that has not been shown to cause cancer, but that containsa carcinogenic impurity, may properly be evaluated under the general safetyclause of the statute using risk assessment procedures to determine whetherthere is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposeduse of the additive. The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott </T3>v. <T3>FDA, </T3>728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5, which containsa carcinogenic chemical but has itself not been shown to cause cancer.Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decision to list thiscolor additive, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejectedthe challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use </ITAG>FDA estimates that the petitioned use of the polyamide-imide resin willresult in extremely low levels of exposure to this additive. The agencycalculated the estimated daily intake of the additive based on considerationssuch as the migration of the additive under the most severe intended useconditions and the types of food-contact articles that may contain thissubstance. The agency estimated the daily intake for the additive to be90 nanograms per person per day. FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic testing to be necessary to determinethe safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure levels(Refs. 1 and 2) and has not required such testing here. However, the agencyhas reviewed available data from subchronic rat and dog feeding studieswith the additive. No adverse effects were observed in these studies. Onthe basis of these data and of the low level of migration of the resin,the agency concludes that there is an adequate margin of safety for theproposed use of the additive. FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safetyclause, considering all available data and using risk assessment proceduresto estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by the carcinogenicchemical, 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine, that may be present as animpurity in this additive. Based on this evaluation, the agency has concludedthat the additive is safe under the proposed conditions of use. The risk assessment procedures that FDA used in this evaluation are similarto the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associatedwith the presence of minor carcinogenic impurities in various other foodand color additives that contain carcinogenic impurities (see, e.g., 49FR 13018 and 13019; April 2, 1984). The risk evaluation of the carcinogenicimpurity 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine has two aspects: (1) Assessmentof the worst-case exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of theadditive, and (2) Extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditionsof probable exposure to humans. A. 4,4andmin16;-Diphenylmethanediamine Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining the polyamide-imide resin and on the level of 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediaminethat may be present in the additive, FDA estimated the hypothetical worst-caseexposure to 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine from the use of this additiveto be 0.20 nanogram per person per day (Ref. 3). The agency used data froma National Toxicology Program technical report on a carcinogenesis bioassayon 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine to estimate the upper-bound levelof lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from theproposed use of the additive (Ref. 4). The results of the bioassay on 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamineindicated that the material was carcinogenic for mice and rats of bothsexes under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantlyincreased incidence of follicular cell tumors of the thyroid in male rats,hepatocellular carcinomas in mice, follicular cell adenomas in mice andfemale rats, pheochromocytomas in male mice, malignant lymphomas in femalerats and neoplastic nodules in the liver of male rats. In addition, severalrare tumors (bile duct adenoma in male rats, and ovarian granulosa-celltumors and urinary bladder transitional-cell papillomas in female rats)were observed in this study. The Cancer Assessment Committee (the Committee) of FDA's Center for FoodSafety and Applied Nutrition reviewed this bioassay and other relevantdata available in the literature and concluded that the findings of carcinogenicitywere supported by this information on 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine.The Committee further concluded that the 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediaminebioassay provided the appropriate basis on which to calculate an estimateof the upper-bound level of lifetime human cancer risk from potential exposureto 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine stemming from the proposed use ofthe additive.The agency used a quantitative risk assessment procedure (linear proportionalmodel) to extrapolate from the dose used in the animal studies to the verylow doses encountered under the proposed conditions of use. This procedureis not likely to underestimate the actual risk from very low doses andmay, in fact, exaggerate it because the extrapolation models used are designedto estimate the maximum risk consistent with the data. For this reason,the estimate can be used with confidence to determine to a reasonable certaintywhether any harm will result from the proposed conditions and levels ofuse of the food additive. Based on a worst-case exposure of 0.20 nanogram per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from potentialexposure to 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine from use of the subject additiveis 2.0andmultiply;10^10 or less than 1 in 5 billion (Ref. 5). Because ofnumerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime averaged individualexposure to 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine is expected to be substantiallyless than the estimated daily intake, and therefore, the calculated upper-boundrisk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonablecertainty of no harm from exposure to 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediaminethat might result from the proposed use of the additive. B. Need for Specifications The agency has also considered whether a specification is necessary tocontrol the amount of 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine in the food additive.The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the followingreasons: (1) Because of the low levels at which 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediaminemay be expected to remain as an impurity following production of the additive,the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of foodat other than extremely small levels; and(2) The upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this impurity,even under worst-case assumptions, is very low, less than 1 in 5 billion.C. Conclusion on Safety FDA has evaluated the available data and other relevant material and concludesthat the proposed use for the additive in components of articles intendedfor repeated use in contact with food is safe and that 21 CFR 177.2450(a), (b), and (c) should be amended as set forth below. The agency is alsoclarifying in this final rule that the reactants benzoyl chloride-3,4-dicarboxylicanhydride and 4,4andmin16;-diphenylmethanediamine, described in the filingnotice, react in equimolar parts in the manufacture of the additive. In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required.
