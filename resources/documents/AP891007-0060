A ranking hard-liner said the Communistsystem should be preserved.   Nemeth, one of the key supporters of reform, told 1,274delegates at a party congress that the new democratic leftist partyhe wants to create from the current Communist Party has no room``for those who have blood on their hands'' from past Communistexcesses.   ``Those who feel unwell here should form their own party,'' hedeclared to applause from the reformist faction at the congress.``It's now possible to do that.''   Nemeth was alluding to Hungary's new commitment to politicalplurality as it institutes reforms that put it at the forefront ofchange within the Soviet bloc along with Poland.   The Communist leadership has agreed to permit the country'sfirst free elections in 41 years by June at the latest and has saidit will abide by the results even if the party is voted out ofpower.   Delegates at the congress, which began Friday, are consideringproposals to terminate their party's 70-year existence and replaceit with a new one drawing heavily on social democratic ideals _similar to leftist parties in Western Europe.   Hard-liners, by contrast, want to tinker with the existing partybut reject founding a new one. Former Politburo member JanosBerecz, an opponent of far-reaching reforms who lost his post inrecent infighting, spoke bitterly of his reform-minded rivals today.   ``I want to conserve my Communist past,'' he declared, addingthat differences with Imre Pozsgay, the leading reformer along withNemeth in the four-man Communist leadership, ``truly put us indifferent parties.''   ``You can tie me to the stake, but you can't do that to the720,000 party members represented by the delegates,'' said Berecz.   Committed hard-liners numbered less than 100 at the congress,but reformists said the old-guard members are actively trying toenlist the support of the more than 700 delegates not committed toeither camp before crucial voting on whether to found a new partyand on top party positions.   A splinter group of orthodox Communist radicals called the HSWPMarxist Unity Front claimed in a leaflet made available toreporters that they had majority support.   Party Chairman Rezsoe Nyers _ a moderate who was chosen tobridge differences among the four-man leadership _ appeared to sidewith Pozsgay and Nemeth Friday in urging the delegates toeffectively terminate the old party.   ``It is my belief that the new party cannot be communist,'' saidNyers. ``The new party also cannot simply be a social democraticone.''   Nyers said the congress should give birth to a new party thatcombines communism with social democratic beliefs. He did notelaborate.   Today Nyers, one of the prime candidates for the post ofchairman of the new party, told Hungarian radio he would accept thepost providing the congress adopts a political platform he agreeswith.   He said he expected ``those opposed to Democratic Socialism tosplit off _ but anything may happen yet'' at the congress.   The Communists have lost a series of parliamentary by-electionsin recent months _ a worrisome development for the party as itprepares for the multiparty election.   A Central Committee draft document made available to reporterson the future party's philosophical makeup said ``DemocraticSocialism'' would mean the party would support:   _Creation of a democratic constitutional state   _A multiparty system   _Referendums and other instruments of direct democracy   _Prevention of excessive centralization of power   _A freely elected Parliament   _Election of a president to strengthen the balance between thebranches of power, and of a government responsible to Parliament.   The process of instituting bolder social and economic changesbegan slowly about two years ago, but gained steam after theousting of Janos Kadar in May 1988 after 32 years of leadership.   The pace of reform in recent months has at times moved Hungaryahead of Poland, the only Soviet bloc country not dominated byCommunists.   Hungary has alienated three repressive Warsaw Pact allies _ EastEast Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia _ with its reformistpolicies, including its decision to allow East Germans in Hungaryfree passage to the West.</TEXT></DOC>
