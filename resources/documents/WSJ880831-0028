Delahanty, its 58-year-old president and chief operating officer, resigned to &quot;pursue other interests.&quot;    Mr. Delahanty's duties will be assumed by Robert F. Mawhinney, 60, chairman and chief executive officer, until the board elects a new president and chief operating officer. Mr. Delahanty, who remains a director, couldn't be reached for comment.    Earlier this month, investors filed a suit against the company and certain individuals, including Messrs. Delahanty and Mawhinney, alleging violation of federal and state securities laws, fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the company's initial public offering in 1987 and other events. Mr. Mawhinney said Mr. Delahanty's resignation isn't related to the litigation.    Xscribe makes computer-aided court transcription systems. </TEXT></DOC>
