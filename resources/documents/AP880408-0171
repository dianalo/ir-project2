William Verity saidFriday that he expected no breakthroughs in trade talks next weekwith Soviet officials in Moscow.   But Verity, who is leading a delegation of American officialsfor the tenth session of the Joint Commercial Commission, said hewas hopeful the negotiations could lay the groundwork for expandedtrade.   The joint commission was formed in 1973 to bring trade agenciesof the two governments together. The meetings will take place atthe same time a trade delegation of 400 American businessmen willbe in Moscow for talks on trade opportunities.   Verity, who will be meeting with Soviet officials includingKremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said the United States wouldseek expanded opportunities for American companies to sell theirproducts in the Soviet Union.   Last year, trade between the United States and the Soviet Uniontotaled $1.5 billion, two-thirds of that in grain sales. Thisrepresented just 0.5 percent of American export sales and was adecline from $4.5 billion in U.S.-Soviet trade in 1979, beforePresident Carter imposed the trade embargo after Soviet troopsinvaded Afghanistan.   ``We are not going to Moscow for any breakthroughs,'' Veritysaid. ``We do not expect any dramatic increase in trade to result.What we hope to do is to create a new climate and a foundation forfuture trade.''   Verity said he would stress that expanded trade can only takeplace if the Soviets make ``further improvements elsewhere in ourbilateral relationship, particularly on human rights andimmigration.''   Asked whether the Thursday announcement that Soviet troops wouldbegin pulling out of Afghanistan on May 15 would help the tradetalks, Verity said he believed that President Reagan was ``veryhappy'' with the development.   ``There isn't any question in my mind that if the Soviets wouldcontinue to indicate that they would like to lessen tensions, thatwould certainly have an effect on the American people and theAmerican Congress,'' Verity said.   Verity, who will leave for Moscow on Sunday, won Cabinetapproval earlier this week for a plan to set up high-level workinggroups with the Soviets to spur exchanges in five areas: foodprocessing, energy, construction equipment, medical products andthe services sector, including insurance.   Verity said it was hoped that these working groups will providechannels to develop specific markets for U.S. products.   The meetings next week are expected to produce some agreementson the establishment of joint ventures between American companiesand the Soviet Union.   The trade meetings will come six weeks before Reagan travels toMoscow for his fourth summit conference with Gorbachev.</TEXT></DOC>
