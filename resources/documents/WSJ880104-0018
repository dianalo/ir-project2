Measured annually, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year 2% above where it started 12 months earlier. But no one will remember 1987 as a year when stocks turned in a positive performance.    From the opening bell Jan. 2 through late August, stocks surged to unprecedented heights --and so did the let's-party moods of more than a few investors who thought that the good times would keep on rolling.    Then came the morning after the night before. In one spectacular 508-point swan dive Oct. 19, the industrial average crashed back to the level it first surpassed in March 1986, vaporizing the stunning advances of the intervening months --along with many investors' paper profits. Over-the-counter stocks came tumbling down the following day, as did stock markets around the globe. It seemed, ominously, that panic, like data, could be transmitted electronically in the blink of an eye.    A year-end rebound in stocks heartened some analysts, but set others to brooding that the stage was being set for an unexciting, meandering performance in 1988.    Bonds were another market in which viewpoint made a difference. For much of the year, bond prices fell while interest rates rose. After the stock market crash, however, bonds lurched out of their bearish slump and headed into 1988 on an upbeat. But total return for 1987, as measured by Shearson Lehman's index of government and corporate bonds, was little more than 2% --shabby indeed in comparison with more than 15% in 1986 and 21% in 1985.    Perspective also is central to the investment outlooks for 1988. Those looking at the glass half-full note that predictions of continued economic growth --albeit at a reduced pace since the stock marekt crash --and still-restrained inflation suggest a congenial environment for many investments. Those who see the glass half-empty observe that a recession seems likely somewhere down the line, and that even if it doesn't actually start until 1989 or beyond, investors could spend much of this year anticipating it.    Add to this jittery uncertainty a show-me skepticism about promises to stabilize the falling dollar and domestic willpower to significantly reduce the U.S. trade and budget deficits. Then stir in the politicial vinegar of a presidential election year.    These are the makings of a demanding year ahead for investors. The stories and statistics in this special report will give you a head start in formulating your strategies and tactics for 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
