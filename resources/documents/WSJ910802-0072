But some money managers and analysts aren't at allsurprised by the lower-than-expected offering price forSinger's 15.6 million shares, or 31.5% of the company.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't see sewing machines as a hot growth area,&quot; saysJohn Miller, research manager with Chicago-based ArielCapital Management, who attended a road show for the deallast month.   Singer, founded in 1851, claims to be the leadingmanufacturer and marketer of consumer sewing machines; thecompany says that it makes one-third of all the sewingmachines sold in the &quot;Free World.&quot; The Singer sewing machinebusiness, spun off in the 1980s, was taken private in aleveraged buy-out last year.   But while some money managers are skeptical about whethersewing machines will be hot sellers in the future, they saythey are far more concerned about certain details about thecompany's operations disclosed both in a preliminaryprospectus for the IPO issued in June and by Singer'smanagers at a cross-country road show for institutionalinvestors.   Singer is incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles, andmost of its assets are located outside the U.S. As Singerstates in its prospectus, &quot;It may be difficult for investorsto enforce outside the U.S. judgments obtained against thecompany in the U.S.&quot; in actions related to violations offederal securities laws and civil lawsuits. Singer also saysthat because its directors and officers live outside theU.S., they, too, may be judgment-proof.   &quot;Singer may have found a way to get around vexatiousshareholder litigation,&quot; says Harvey Pitt, a Washingtonsecurities lawyer. &quot;But if I were a shareholder, I'd considerthis a huge minus, because it means I'd have no recourse.&quot;   In another unusual twist, all of the company's 14directors are insiders of Singer, or its Canadian parent,Semi-Tech Ltd. While the company says it intends to appointan outside director after its offering is completed, somemoney managers and lawyers are puzzled that it hasn't done soyet. &quot;You can go public without any outside directors, butit's not advisable,&quot; Mr. Pitt says.   According to the prospectus, Singer appears to haveexperienced sharp growth since Semi-Tech bought it for $269million. For 1990, Singer posted net income of $43.3 millionon revenue of $634.7 million. That compared with net of $3.9million on revenue of $384.8 million for the nine monthsended in December 1989. Semi-Tech doesn't report earnings forthe full 1989 year.   Officials of Semi-Tech and Merrill weren't available tocomment on the offering yesterday, because of legalrestrictions affecting new offerings.   But some money managers said they found the growth inSinger's business puzzling and believe that Singer's sharprevenue growth may have come at the expense of other parts ofits business. The company appears not to have funded all but$4.4 million of its $58.9 million in foreign pensionobligations as of 1990.   People close to Singer said it's not uncommon forcompanies with major overseas operations to have largeunfunded pension obligations.   According to the prospectus and people close to Singer,the company expects the current 5% to 7% annual growth in itssewing machine business to continue, reflecting growingworld-wide sales.   And Singer expects greater growth in its consumer durablesbusiness, which accounted for 27% of its revenues last year.Singer markets such products as televisions, videocassetterecorders, stereos and home appliances in more than 100countries, the prospectus says.   In recent weeks, Singer has courted money managers in itsbid to get them interested in buying the company's shares.But some money managers said yesterday that one major reasonwhy they are not biting is that the company hasn't treatedshareholders well in the past.   James Ting, the Canadian who is Singer's chairman andchief executive officer, led the tender offer bid for Singer,which began in 1989, that took the company private. Under theterms of the offer, Mr. Ting was to complete the deal asquickly as possible. If the offer wasn't completed within ayear, Mr. Ting would face stiff financial penalties. Thetender offer and merger were completed -- 364 days after theybegan -- a delay that was to the detriment of minorityshareholders.</TEXT></DOC>
