In an interview with the newspaper Magyar Hirlap, Grosz wasquoted as stressing the ``political necessity and moralobligation'' for direct talks with Romania to find an end to thedispute.   The newspaper said Grosz, who also is premier, wants to go toRomania for talks but did not know when.   Grosz was quoted as saying there have been no contacts betweenhe and Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu but considered itimportant that Ceausescu had called for a meeting betweenrepresentatives of the two nations to improve relations.   On Friday, the Hungarian Parliament passed a resolution accusingRomania of violating the human rights of ethnic Hungarians andother minorities in the neighboring East-bloc country.   The action was taken at the end of a week of escalating tensionsover Romania's planned demolition of 7,000 villages with theresidents to be resettled in ``agro-industrial'' centers.   Budapest newspapers said some Hungarians were being preventedfrom entering Romania.   The resolution adopted by Parliament with only one abstentionsaid Romania is violating ``the fundamental human, national andnationalities-related rights.''   It called on Romania to re-examine its resettlement plan.   There are about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living in Romaniaand about 220,000 ethnic Germans as well as thousands of Serbs.Most of the Hungarians live in Transylvania, many in villages to bedestroyed.   Romania claims the resettlement will provide higher livingstandards and gain productive agricultural land where houses nowstand.   ``The annihilation of the values of the settlements doomed todestruction ... would mean an irreparable loss not only to theHungarian, German and other ethnic minorities, but also to theRomanian people themselves,'' the resolution said.   Earlier this week Romania expelled several Hungarian diplomatsfrom an area inhabited by many ethnic Hungarians, closed aHungarian consulate in Cluj and began turning back Hungariantourists.   Matyas Szueroes, the head of the foreign relations committee whopresented the resolution to Parliament, said Hungary's leadershipwould ``always be cooperating partners'' and was prepared to goahead with preparations for a meeting of the two countries'premiers.   Hungarian newspapers quoted officials and travelers as sayingHungarians wishing to enter Romania were being turned back at theborder.   In some cases only those traveling through Romania to otherdestinations were allowed to cross into the country, the paperssaid.   Romania's decision to close the Hungarian consulate in Cluj inTraynsylvania followed a demonstration by some 50,000 people whomarched past the Romanian Embassy in Budapest to protest theresettlement plan.</TEXT></DOC>
