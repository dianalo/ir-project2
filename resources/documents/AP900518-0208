(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury began deliberations Thursday oncharges that a reputed Colombian drug lord conspired to ship morethan 1,000 pounds of cocaine to the United States.   Prosecutors contend Jose Abello-Silva operated an extensive drugshipment network, but he maintains he is a legitimate businessmanwho got up and left a key meeting when talk turned to cocainesmuggling.   Abello is one of 15 Colombians extradited since August to facedrug charges in the United States, Justice Department spokesmanHarri Kramer said.   ``He is the biggest fish landed by the United States in theColombian sea of narcotics,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney DavidO'Meilia.   He is charged with conspiracy to import drugs into the UnitedStates and conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute.He was arrested in October in Bogota and extradited to Tulsa.   Prosecutors called 23 witnesses during five weeks of testimony.Many were convicted drug smugglers who identified Abello in thecourtroom and said he supervised drug shipments from Colombianairstrips through the Bahamas.   Abello testified he was an honest rancher and auto dealer.   Three prosecution witnesses were named as co-conspirators inAbello's indictment. Among them was Boris Olarte, who was beingheld in a Tulsa jail when Abello allegedly conspired during aFebruary 1987 meeting in Aruba to import 500 kilograms, or 1,100pounds, of cocaine into the United States.   Money from the shipment allegedly was to be used to get Olarteout of jail.   Abello is being tried in Tulsa because of phone calls and moneyexchanges between people in Tulsa and Florida allegedly part of theconspiracy.   The defendant admitted the meeting took place in Aruba, anisland off the coast of Venezuela, but he said when theconversation turned to cocaine, he left.   ``He never agreed to do anything with those folks,'' defenseattorney Patrick Williams said in closing arguments.   The jury, whose identities were kept secret, began deliberatingabout 8:30 a.m. Thursday. U.S. District Judge Thomas Brett saidthey asked for copies of the indictment and writing materials.   If convicted, Abello faces an $8 million fine and would serve nomore than 30 years in prison, prosecutors said.</TEXT></DOC>
