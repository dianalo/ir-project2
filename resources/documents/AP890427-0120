GERMAIN, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Forty-three people have been arrestedin the latest wave of demonstrations against Chippewa Indianspearfishing in off-reservation public lakes.   The arrests were made Wednesday when large crowds gathered atboat landings in northern Wisconsin where the annual Chippewaspearing season began last weekend prior to the fishing season fornon-Indians.   Federal courts since 1983 have upheld 19th century treaties inwhich the Chippewa deeded northern Wisconsin to the United Statesand were guaranteed the right to hunt, fish, trap and harvest wildgrain on public land.   Critics say the Indians' spears leave too few trophy-size fishfor the rod-and-reel season that begins next month. More than 400people rallied Wednesday at the state Capitol in Madison,complaining that spearing discourages sport fishing upstate andreduces the region's summer tourism business.   Tribal members are expected to spear about 30,000 fish thisspring, compared with an annual hook-and-line walleye catch ofabout 800,000 fish annually in northern Wisconsin.   The Chippewa have announced plans to spear at 254 lakes.   Five of the tribe's six Wisconsin bands fished Wednesday.   Wardens and police have been kept busy this season shieldingspearers from hecklers, said George Meyer, DNR administrator ofenforcement for the Department of Natural Resources.   ``It's starting out every night with a crowd someplace,'' Meyersaid.   The Chippewa fish at night with battery-powered lights toilluminate walleyed pike, muskellunge and other fish in shallowwater.   At Rainbow Flowage, a Wisconsin River reservoir, 35 people werearrested Wednesday night for disorderly conduct or obstructingpolice after walking into a restricted area at a public boatlanding used by Chippewa, said David Kunelius, a DNR spokesman.   About 150 miles to the west, six people were taken into custodyat Balsam Lake in Polk County for various offenses from scatteringnails on roads to disorderly conduct, Kunelius said.   One man was arrested for disorderly conduct at Crescent Lake,where a crowd peaked at about 200 people. Another was arrested fortire slashing at Seven-Mile Lake, where there were no spearers,Kunelius said.</TEXT></DOC>
