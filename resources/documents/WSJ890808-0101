The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 4.31, or nearly 1%, to a record 461.73. The Nasdaq 100 Index of big nonfinancial stocks vaulted 7.24 to 437.52 on the strength of the technology issues that dominate it. The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 2.49 to 454.80.    Traders said investors were snapping up technology issues of all sizes -- from giant Intel, to medium-sized DSC Communications, to tiny Chips andamp; Technologies. Intel, with a market value of more than $4 billion, gained 1 to 32 3/4 on 2.2 million shares; DSC Communications, which has a market value of about $365 million, added 3/8 to 15 1/8 on 2.8 million shares, and Chips andamp; Technologies, valued at about $126 million, jumped 1 3/4 to 25 3/4 on 889,700 shares.    Contrary to widespread Wall Street expectations, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. didn't add any technology stocks to the securities company's recommended list. But that fact didn't dissuade investors.    &quot;The techs are back,&quot; declared Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. &quot;(Investors) were after them all day long, even at the closing.&quot; Mr. Zipper said some investors, who had earlier been betting that technology stock prices would decline further, were also buying shares to replace the stock they had borrowed to &quot;sell short.&quot;    Moreover, Mr. Zipper believes the technology group will continue to attract buyers for at least a few more sessions and push the Nasdaq Composite higher. &quot;They've been depressed for an awfully long time,&quot; he said.    William Rothe, OTC trading chief at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore, said individuals, as well as institutional investors, were buying stocks. However, he acknowledged that many analysts and investors remain cautious about the overall stock market, worried that it may be headed for a severe correction.    But, Mr. Rothe noted that there is more cash available for stock-market investing now than there was in 1987. He noted that interest rates now are falling, rather than rising as they were two years ago.    While many investors were buying issues and the Nasdaq Composite was rising, Hedi Reynolds, head of OTC trading at Morgan Keegan andamp; Co., in Memphis, Tenn., said some individual investors seized the opportunity to take profits. The unusually heavy trading activity for a Monday boosted Nasdaq volume to 135.2 million shares. Of the 4,401 stocks that changed hands, 1,113 advanced and 780 declined.    Nasdaq's biggest telecommunications issues rose, as well. MCI Communications added 1 to 38 1/8 on 2.4 million shares. Class A shares of Tele-Communications also improved 1, to 37 1/8 on nearly 1.1 million shares.    Shares of Jerrico rose 3 3/8 to 24 after the restaurant operator said it agreed to be acquired by an investment group controlled by New York-based DJS-Inverness andamp; Co. and Castle Harlan Inc. The investment group will acquire Jerrico for $24.25 a share, or $620 million. Jerrico said the investment group will begin a tender offer through a new corporation later this week for all shares outstanding, subject to, among other things, at least 51% of Jerrico's stock being tendered.    Home Intensive Care tumbled 1 1/8 to 4 5/8. The company said third-quarter net income rose to $1.3 million, or 14 cents a share, from $1.1 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest third-quarter earnings represented a decline from the second quarter. The company said its latest results reflected new administrative costs related to the start-up of its home infusion therapy division. In addition, the company's third-quarter provision for bad debts increased by about $700,000 over the second quarter.    Helen of Troy added 3/4 to 18 1/4 on 207,000 shares, compared with an average daily volume of 167,300 shares. The haircare appliance maker's chairman said sales and earnings for the first two months of its fiscal second quarter, ending Aug. 30, outpaced those in June and July of 1988. He also said he sees record results for the remainder of the fiscal year ended next February. Gerald J. Rubin, the company's chairman, said he is comfortable with earnings estimates of $2.35 to $2.40 a share this fiscal year, compared with $1.83 a share that Helen of Troy earned last year.    Falconbridge rose 1/8 to 31 bid on 108,800 shares. An article in Barron's raised doubts about Amax's ability to handle the debt it will assume if its proposed acquisition of Falconbridge, a Canadian nickel producer, is successful.    Vikonics rose 1/4 to 5 3/8 on volume of 20,300 shares, well above its daily average turnover of 1,846 shares. The maker of computer-based security systems earned $159,000, or seven cents a share, in the first quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $579,000 a year earlier. On Friday, before the earnings were announced, Vikonics rose 3/8 on 51,200 shares.    The National Association of Securities Dealers said it continued the trading halt in shares of Lifeline Health-care Group. The Securities and Exchange Commission had ordered a 10-day trading halt in the stock beginning July 26 because of questions about recent trading activity and about the adequacy and accuracy of disclosures concerning the company's business operations, acquisitions and major stockholders. </TEXT></DOC>
