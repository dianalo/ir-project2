<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0197 </DOCNO><TEXT>A general method of gauging the BRST algebra by combining a (local) ghostnumber symmetry with the standard (global) BRST algebra, is displayed.This method enables us to construct an automatically nilpotent localBRST algebra and to obtain in a straightforward way the correspondingversions of the action and the eventual anomalies. To illustrate theprocedure we study the Yang-Mills and the free bosonic string theories(including the 'conformal' Beltrami parametrization) and show that itreproduces the results discussed in the literature. Two major outcomesof this scheme are briefly discussed: A possible connection between ghostnumber and BRST currents, arising from the Slavnov identities and theimplications of the ghost number anomaly for the BRST localization programin theories such as string theory.</TEXT></DOC>
