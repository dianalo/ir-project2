With theuse of emission abatement strategies, local ground level concentrationshave decreased in the vicinity of new stationary sources. The pontentialfor long-term, progressive, subtle impact on the environment remains.A number of issues and concerns have been indentified in documents publishedby Alberta Encironment. Research and monitoring/surveillance programsneed to be expanded and implemented to overcome knowledge deficiencies.To facilitate this, Alberta Environment established three research programs:Departmental Acid Deposition; Air Qualtity; and Environmental Contaminants.This paper dicusses the details of each program. 17 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
