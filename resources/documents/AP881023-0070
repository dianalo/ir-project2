The week-long visit to Boston starting Nov. 4 will be the firstby such a high-level interdenominational church group, according toDavid Bleakley, secretary of the Irish Council of Churches.   ``Our agenda is to tell the good news about Ireland and not getmixed up in all the marginal and tribal issues that can arise,'' hesaid.   Bleakley said delegation members will include Dr. Robin Eames,primate of the Protestant Church of Ireland; Bishop Cahal Daly,whose Catholic diocese includes Belfast; the Presbyterian moderatorin Ireland, Dr. Godfrey Brown; the Rev. Charles Eyre, generalsecretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland, and the Rev. MatthewWallace, a west Belfast Catholic priest.   The group has been invited by an Anglican church near Bostonthat administers a peace trust aimed at fostering reconciliation inIreland, Bleakley said. He did not identify the church. Boston hasa large population of Irish-Americans.   As part of the program Daly will speak on Irish mythology, Brownwill give an address on reconciliation in Northern Ireland andEames will discuss what he believes the future holds in Ireland,Bleakley said.   ``It is really to show the Americans by our witness being therethat there is not a holy war in Ireland, but that great andsignificant things are being done by Christians working togetherfor peace,'' he added.   Sectarian warfare has ravaged Northern Ireland, a Britishprovince, for more than a decade.   Guerrillas of the predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Armyare fighting to unite the province, where Protestants outnumberCatholics 3-2, with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland.</TEXT></DOC>
