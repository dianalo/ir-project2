The company said it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin testing the new treatment in humans. The treatment will allow doctors to deliver extra-large doses of existing anti-cancer drugs to the site of a brain tumor.    Currently, doctors treat brain tumors by surgically removing as much of the tumor as possible. Often, however, some residue of the tumor remains, grows back and poses a fatal threat to the patient. Doctors usually can't remove the entire tumor or inject enough drugs to destroy it without risking severe problems to the patient.    In Nova's new treatment, surgeons would leave a capsule containing a large dose of an anti-cancer drug at the site of the tumor. The capsule is made of a biodegradable polymer that releases an even amount of the drug over two weeks.    &quot;The polymer will expose the tumor to about 10,000 times the concentration now possible through traditional chemotherapy,&quot; said Solomon Snyder, a neurochemist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, who is associated with Nova.    Nova is involved in the discovery of new drugs based on natural proteins found in the brain. The special time-released polymer licensed by Nova was developed by Robert Langer, a biochemist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.    The company said the procedure -- the first of its type -- is still highly experimental and that its effectiveness won't be known until after initial studies are completed.    Separately, Nova said it was granted a patent for a pain-killing drug, bradykinin antagonists.    It said it will develop the drug in a topical-application form to treat skin inflammations and burns, and as a nasal spray to treat cold symptoms. Nova didn't indicate how the new product would affect earnings if it is successfully developed.    In national over-the-counter trading, the company's stock fell 37.5 cents yesterday to close at $15.625 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
