Continental Airlines, another Texas Air unit, posted a modest profit for the period. But the earnings weren't nearly enough to offset the cost of the strike and subsequent bankruptcy-law filing at Eastern, which has been operating under Chapter 11 protection since March 9, five days after the strike began.    Texas Air's loss, narrower than its $255.9 million loss in the 1988 second quarter, included the gain on the shuttle's sale in June to developer Donald Trump. The latest deficit came as the company's rivals continued the airline industry's succession of record-setting quarters begun last year. Indeed, several carriers said their traffic surged because of the Eastern strike.    Second-quarter revenue plunged 34% to $1.4 billion from a restated $2.13 billion.    Analysts were encouraged by Continental's results. &quot;I expected Continental's results to be weaker,&quot; said Tom Longman, an airline analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;I was pleasantly surprised they were so strong.&quot;    Continental reported net income of $32.1 million on revenue of $1.3 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Continental had a loss of $150.9 million on revenue of $1.1 billion. Continental's chairman, D. Joseph Corr, predicted &quot;we will make further progress during the second half of the year.&quot;    Eastern's loss was $129.3 million, including the shuttle gain, $17.2 million in bankruptcy court costs and a $65.7 million pension curtailment charge. The pension charge is an assessment of what the cost would be if its striking or furloughed employees take early retirement, a spokesman said. Required under accounting procedures, it doesn't reflect an actual cash outlay, the spokesman said. In the year-ago quarter, Eastern had a loss of $89.8 million.    Because of the strike, Eastern's revenue dried up to $89.6 million, compared with year-ago revenue of $1 billion.    Eastern seemed to lose money at about the same rate as before the strike and the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Longman said, and it needs to continue to sell assets quickly.    Under a plan presented to its creditors, Eastern plans to sell $1.8 billion in assets and gradually start up service in many of the markets it served before it was grounded by the machinists strike.    Last month, Eastern flew 226 flights a day, and beginning today is expected to increase that number to 350 daily flights, mostly into and out of its Atlanta hub. The carrier has had to charter five jets from Continental to fly its August schedule. Eastern says that is a temporary measure as newly hired pilots make their way through the airline's training program.    For the six months, the loss narrowed to $364.9 million from $380.1 million. Revenue fell 23% to $3.28 billion from a restated $4.26 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
