First, to clarify the breadth of payments governed by these regulations.In addition to the benefit payments enumerated in the current text of 31CFR 210.2(d), these regulations apply to nonbenefit payments, includingbut not limited to, vendor payments, Internal Revenue Service tax refunds,savings bonds, grants, and loans. This part, as its title suggests, generallyapplies to all Federal payments through financial institutions by the AutomatedClearing House (ACH) method. Second, a section on prenotification is addedto establish the framework for these messages. Third, provisions are added,expressly applying the ACH method of payment to discretionary allotmentsof Federal employees' wage and salary payments. Fourth, other minor changesare needed including the expansion of the definition of financial institutionand the addition of a paragraph to cover instances of termination of enrollmentsdue to the closing of a financial institution. This revision will addressthese needs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE</T2>: Comments on this proposed rule must be received by September26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS</T2>: Comments may be mailed to the Policy Research Branch,Financial Management Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Room 328,Liberty Center, 401 14th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20227.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>: Karen Pedone, (202) 287-0347.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>: Part 210 of Title 31 of the Code ofFederal Regulations sets forth the rights and liabilities of the FederalGovernment, the financial institution and the recipient where a recipientof Federal Government payments authorizes Direct Deposit of the paymentsand the payments are made by the ACH method. The regulations in this partwere promulgated in 1975 and revised in 1976, 1984, and 1987. Since thattime, it has become apparent that the regulations need clarification andimprovement in a number of respects. Notably, we propose to clarify thatthe coverage of the regulations includes all nonbenefit payments in responseto a Financial Management Service (a bureau of the United States Departmentof the Treasury) objective to increase the utilization of the ACH methodfor Federal Government payments. Accordingly, Subpart A is expanded toclarify the breadth of payments governed by these regulations which generallyapply to all Federal payments through financial institutions by the AutomatedClearing House (ACH) method.There are a number of new definitions found in these proposed regulationsat andSection; 210.2, including definitions of allotment, allottee, allotter,discretionary allotments, employee, and nonbenefit payment. The currentdefinition of ``Financial institution'' has been expanded to cover thecase where a financial institution maintains an account with a correspondentrather than with the Federal Reserve Bank and adds the following sentence,``Where a financial institution utilizes the services of a correspondentbank, the term fiancial institution shall include a designated correspondent.''The current definition of ``Payment'' has been expanded to include nonbenefitpayments. The current definition of ``Payment institution'' has been modifiedto change the phrase ``similar writing'' to read ``similar document'' todescribe more accurately the medium on which a payment instruction maybe contained. Finally, the current definition of ``Recipient'' has beenexpanded to mean a person, corporation, or other public or private entitywhich is authorized by a program agency to receive benefit or nonbenefitpayments from the Federal Government. ``Recipient'' includes a naturalperson or entity authorized by a program agency to receive benefit paymentsfor a beneficiary.A new paragraph designated andSection; 210.4(c)(5) has been added to coverinstances of termination of enrollments due to the closing of a financialinstitution.Changes have been made to andSection; 210.6(e) to reflect that the FederalReserve Bank will now be required to make the amount specified in a nonbenefitpayment available for withdrawal from a financial institution's books onthe payment date. This is consistent with current usage in the commercialworld and other Treasury programs such as TREASURY DIRECT and State andlocal Government payments. Treasury has made an exception to this ruleby requiring that benefit and salary payments be made available to therecipient at the opening of business on payment date in the interest ofpromoting the use of Direct Deposit and will continue with this policyfor these payments only.Benefit and salary payments (and allotments therefrom) will continue tobe made available for withdrawal by the opening of business on the paymentdate.A parallel change has been made to andSection; 210.7(d) which also requiresfinancial institutions to make the amount specified in a nonbenefit paymentinstruction available for withdrawal or other use by the recipient on thepayment date. Again, benefit and salary payments (and allotments therefrom)will continue to be made available for withdrawal not later than the openingof business on the payment date.Section 210.8 has been added to establish the framework for sending prenotificationmessages to financial institutions prior to the first payment. Shortlybefore the initial payment is to occur, the Government may send the financialinstitution a prenotification message to alert it to the fact that a futureACH payment will be made. Prenotification also provides an opportunityfor verification by the financial institution of the accuracy of the accountinformation. All the information relating to the ACH payment, except theamount of the payment, will be provided so that the information can beverified by the financial institution. Policy determinations regardingthe use of prenotification may be made from time to time by the Servicewith any class of ACH payments. Prenotification is an optional mechanismthat typically will be used for non-benefit payment files. Prenotificationprocedures will be published as amendments to <T3>The Green Book</T3>.A new Subpart C has been added to establish the framework by which FederalGovernment employees may make discretionary allotment payments directlyfrom there wage and salary payments by ACH to a third party account.The changes and new procedures will be published as amendments to <T3>The Green Book</T3> on Direct Deposit.Treasury has determined that this is not a major rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.It is hereby certified pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act thatthis revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act analysisis not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 210</ITAG>Banks, banking, Electronic funds transfer, Federal Reserve System.Accordingly, 31 CFR Part 210 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 210_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
