John J. Conyers and three othercongressmen on Tuesday introduced a bill that would ban the exportof most American waste.   The legislation would cover any hazardous waste, waste oil,incinerator ash and other forms of solid waste, with someexceptions for material that would be recycled in the countryreceiving it. Violators would be subject to as much as two years inprison and fines of $50,000, with both to be doubled on a secondoffense.   Conyers, a Democrat, said at a news conference that thelegislation would apply to both rich and poor countries. Heemphasized the effect of U.S. waste exports in the Third World,calling them ``an act of toxic terrorism.'' He said poor countriescould be tempted by the offer of large sums by U.S. companies.   According to Jim Vallette, a researcher for Greenpeace, eightindustrial countries have received U.S. waste since 1986:Australia, Finland, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Britain andWest Germany. Vallette added that some of the waste shipped toThird World countries has gone through Italy.   A Greenpeace report said that Britain has become a majorrecipient of waste from Europe, the United States and recently fromNew Zealand, largely because fees for its waste disposal are muchlower than in continental Europe.   The Greenpeace report said at least 11 Third World countrieshave received waste from the United States and Europe in thatperiod: Brazil, Guinea, Lebanon, Sierra Leone, Syria, Venezuela,Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Haiti.   Conyers, a Democrat, was joined by two other Democrats _ Reps.James J. Florio of New Jersey and Chester G. Atkins ofMassachusetts _ and Republican Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, insponsoring the bill. It would exempt Canada and Mexico from theexport ban because they have agreements with the U.S. government onwaste disposal.</TEXT></DOC>
