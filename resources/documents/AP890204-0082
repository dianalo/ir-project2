But likecongressmen, federal judges and President Bush's Cabinet officers,he's up for a sizable pay raise.   Alexander, research director at an Air Force laboratory in Texas,is one of 7,100 members of the senior executive service _ managersof federal programs ranging from space missions to tax collection _whose pay is tied to presidential recommendations.   Spokesman Jim Lafferty of the Office of Personnel Managementcalls the senior executives ``the top part of the federalgovernment's middle management.''   To Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executive Association,a group formed by the senior managers, they are ``the glue of thegovernment. Without them it couldn't run.''   Annual salaries for senior managers now range from $68,700 to$80,700; they would be $80,000 to $120,000 if the raise takes effecton Wednesday, with the average being $98,000.   While Congress and the judges would get a 51 percent raise,members of the senior executive service would get raises rangingfrom 16 percent to 49 percent. Another 700 federal employees knownas ``super graders'' who have management responsibilities would getsimilar pay hikes.   The exact size of the pay increases is in flux, as congressionalleaders deal with mounting pressure to scale back the raise.   A dozen senior executives interviewed in recent weeks said, notsurprisingly, that they supported the raise. Most said their supportstemmed not solely from personal financial interest but also from ahope that higher pay will help the government attract top talent.   Alexander has been a federal employee for 28 years, risingthrough the ranks to a position in which he now is directlyresponsible for 200 people, five of whom are at top civil servicelevels and paid more than he is.   Still, in Alexander's words, ``It's always my hide if there's ascrew up.''   Alexander is paid $71,900 a year and said his salary would riseto $90,000 if Congress allows the pay package to take effect onWednesday. He says he could make double that in the private sector,but won't quit despite having two sons in college and a third inhigh school.   ``I've built a life and career in government and I intend to stayeven after I reach retirement eligibility in two years,'' Alexandersaid in a telephone interview.   Marylouise Uhlig predicts ``a major crisis in government'' ifCongress kills the pay raises, something she said would prompt a``major exodus'' of managers.   ``I really do think that you get the kind of government that youpay for,'' said Uhlig, director of program management at theEnvironmental Protection Agency's pesticide and toxic substancesdivision. ``In order to keep good people you have to pay them.''   Uhlig's duties as director of the agency's Office of Pesticidesand Toxic Substances range from hiring and budgeting to acting as aliaison with regional EPA offices.   ``I'm paying for this raise too,'' is her answer to criticism theraises will bloat the federal budget. ``My entire salary is taxed.''   If you want to know how much grain is grown in Nebraska or thetop crop in Utah you might try Fred Vogel, director of theAgriculture Department's state statistical division.   ``You look at some of the salaries on the outside and you wonderwhy you hang around and listen to all of the government bashing,''said Vogel, who supervises 675 employees in 45 states and a $40million budget.   So why does he?   ``You get committed to your job and your employees and you feelthat what you're doing helps,'' said Vogel, who now makes $76,400 ayear and would see his pay to jump to $98,000.   Bonosaro said an informal survey by the Senior ExecutivesAssociation supported Uhlig's talk of a mass exodus in themanagement posts.   ``They have no real reason to stay and wait another four years,''she said. The commission that suggested the raises meets every fouryears.   The commission said the cost of paying the executives' raiseswould be $41 million in the current fiscal year and $71 million nextyear. ``Less than a third of the cost of a B-1 bomber,'' is thecomparison made by Bonosaro.</TEXT></DOC>
