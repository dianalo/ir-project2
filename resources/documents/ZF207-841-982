(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SIGHT AND SOUNDandM;Long-time users of electronic mail services have been thrown into a quandaryrecently by the availability of programs they can use to create text andgraphics on their personal computers.andP;  Should I use these integrated toolsand thereby surrender the ability to collaborate and share data with mycolleagues easily, they ask themselves, or should I continue to be restrictedto text-only systems and resort to cutting and pasting each time I need toput together complex documents?andM;The BBN/Slate [TM] package was designed to answer this question.andP;  Itimplements a multimedia document system that encourages electroniccollaborationa mong coworkers.andP;  Developed by BBN Systems and TechnologiesCorp. and marketed through BBN Software Products Corp., this commercialsoftware package gives users the ability to create complex documentscontaining text in English and other languages, line-art graphics,spreadsheets and associated business graphics, images in both color and blackand white, and digitized voice data.andM;In addition to an integrated, highly graphical interface for creating andviewing multimedia documents, BBN/Slate provides functions for filing andmanaging folders of documents, printing and previewing documents, mailingfull multimedia documents, and teleconferencing in real time.andP;  It isavailable for all Sun Microsystems workstations that run SunOS and theSunView window system.andP;  Work is currently in progress to deliver a versionbased on the X Window System (X.11).andM;BBN/Slate has its origins in a series of DARPA- and NSF-sponsored researchprojects that began in 1983.andP;  Their charter was to design and implementcomputerized aids for collaborative work.andP;  Areas of interest includedelectronic proposal submission, methods for the editorial review andannotation of electronci documents, and teleconferencing.andM;Because the textual material in proposals often refers to graphical orpictorial material, multimedia capabilities were considered crucial indesigning tools to support collaborative work.andP;  In the past, users wereforced to insert non-text media objects into their documents using manual&quot;cut and paste&quot; procedures.andP;  Obviously, there are advantages to making itpossible to include both text and non-text objects in a single electronicdocument.andP;  Researchers also wanted to include the capability to put spokenmaterial &quot;in&quot; a document, to give users a powerful and natural annotationmechanism that would serve the needs of collaborators not otherwisecomfortable using computers.andM;BBN/Slate's roots are in electronic mail, then, rather than in desktoppublishing.andP;  The initial concern of those of us involved in its developmentwas to extend electronic mail so that it would include capabilities forhandling graphics, images, and voice in an integrated fashion.andP;  Over thecourse of the project, it became apparent that, if such a system was to beuseful in collaborative work, it would first have to be useful to a personworking alone (this rule holds true for many other collaboration tools.andM;This principle motivated us to consider many of the capabilities integratedinto electronic publishing systems as candidates for merger with the featuresof electronic mail systems.andP;  However, our initial orientation continues toaffect the design of the system.andP;  The BBN/Slate editor implements a fullspreadsheet editor rather than simply a table editor, since those involved incollaborative work are often interested in the model behind their numbers,not just the final figures.andP;  It also includes capabilities for reading andcreating documents in their electronic form--a feature which is of paramountimportance, since many electronic documents are never initially rendered onpaper.andP;  The BBN/Slate editor supports this capability by providing a &quot;galley&quot;view of documents rather than a strict page-oriented view, thus eliminatingthe distraction of page interruptions that are needed only when documents areeventually going to be rendered on paper.andM;Hardware Requirements for Multimedia Processing.andP;  Another motivating factorbehind the BBN/Slate development effort was the availability of such keytechnologies as affordable graphics displays, scanning devices, voicedigitization equipment, and electronic mail communications networks.andM;Clearly, the most important single hardware requirement for multimediasoftware is adequate display.andP;  A high-quality graphics device is arequirement for the display of objects such as line-art graphics, images, andproportional-spaced character fonts on WYSIWYG systems.andP;  It is also importantto be able to produce a hard copy of anything that appears on the screen.andO;The advent of affordable Postscript-capable laser printers has greatlyassisted developers working on multimedia software.andM;Selecting hardware for voice-data transfer was an interesting challenge,since there were no industry-standard interfaces other than serial availablefor all the platforms we targeted.andP;  and the serial interface had one majordisadvantage: it was unable to handle the high data rates nanywhere from 16to 64 kilobits per second) typically required for voice-data transfer.andP;  Mostof the SCSI devices available had the disadvantage of requiring modificationsin the UNIX kernel before their device drivers could be installed.andP;  Through aprocess of elimination, we eventually decided to use Ethernet as ourinterface, on the grounds that it was widely available and had the requisitethroughput.andM;After an extensive review of all the alternatives, we chose to use NaturalMicrosystems' Watson board, which is made to be installed in a PC-XT clone.andO;It is accessed from a UNIX-based workstation via a TCP/IP connection overEthernet, using a server developed with the Sun PC-NFS socket libraries.andP;  TheWatson board supports a direct interface with the user's telephone,eliminating the need for a separate microphone for voice input.andP;  Nat uralMicrosystems subsequently made a board for the Sun386i with a UNIX driverthat vastly simplified implementation of voice capability on that platform.andM;Operating-System Requirements for Multimedia Processing.andP;  although researchversions of BBN Slate software have been ported to a variety of platforms,including non-UNIX-based machines, the primary development system used hasalways been UNIX.andP;  A number of UNIX features were useful in the developmentof large, complex multimedia systems:andM;* Interprocess communication and multitasking.andP;  The ability to break thesystem into separate, communicating programs is an important feature when itcomes to managing the development and modification of a software system by agroup of programmers working together.andP;  providing background printing andmail spooling, and allowing the user to switch easily between managing mailfolders, editing a document, modifying the calendar, and previewing a printeddocument are trivial tasks, given the underlying multitasking support ofUNIX.andM;* Virtual memory support.andP;  a larg virtual memory is critical, making itpossible to build a single integrated environment.andM;* Software development tools.andP;  Our collective experience in developingsoftware in various non-UNIX environments has convinced us of theproductivity improvements that UNIX software tools can provide.andP;  Our dailywork procedures include extensive use of make, yacc, lex, rcs (the RevisionControl System), and symbolic debuggers, as well as electronic mail andconferencing.andP;  We have also written a number of special-purpose tools,including a compiler for a dialog-layout language that has greatley increasedthe speed with which we can design complex interactive dialogs.andM;Our only problems in using UNIX involve its deficiencies in the area ofreal-time interrupts, which are needed to support digitized speech and imagescanning.andP;  Our current solutions require either off-loading the processing toa PC or providing on-board processing and buffering to reduce the real-timeoperating-system requirements.andM;Multimedia capabilities.andP;  The BBN/Slate multimedia software currentlyincorporates five separate media editors in a seamless interface.andP;  Figure 1illustrates a sample multimedia document in which each of the five majormedia type are represented.andP;  The following sections broadly describe thecapabilities associated with each of the media editors in the currentimplementation:andM;Text.andP;  Slate text can be formatted in a wide range of styles.andP;  Users canchange margins, tab stops, line spacing, justification, font, and otherparameters.andP;  Certain styles are predefined, but users are free to developtheir own styles and use them in creating new documents.andP;  All formatting isdone as text is entered, and effects of formatting changes a re immediatelyvisible.andP;  Individual words may be displayed in various font families (TimesRoman, Helvetica, or fixed-width) in roman, bold, italic, bold italic,underlined, double-underlined, or overstruck faces, or in a size smaller orlarger than the surrounding text, such as is used for superscripted orsubscripted characters.andM;Slate text can also include a variety of foreign-language characters,including the kinds of non-Roman characters used in Russian, Arabic, andKorean.andP;  As shown in Figure 2, the system can deal with lanaguages that havecomplex rendering rules (Arabic and Korean, for example) or complex inputrequirements.andP;  For most languages, input is handled by a remapped virtualkeyboard, shown in Figure 3 for the Arabic language.andM;Geometric graphics.andP;  A Slate graphics element is a drawing that may includelines, geometric figures (polygons, circles, ellipses), text, and bitmapimages.andP;  Closed regions (such as polygons) may be shaded with textures(regular-bit patterns that fill the regions), and the individual objectswithin a drawing may overlap one another.andP;  The standard graphics palette isshown in Figure 4.andP;  Graphics features are positioned on separate levels andalso may overlap each other.andP;  Standard rulers, grids, and size indicators areprovided.andM;Spreadsheets.andP;  A Slate spreadsheet element is a table that can be representedas a two-dimensional array in which each element or cell can be empty or cancontain a number, label, date, or formula.andP;  Formulas serve to relate thecontents of cells to other cells in the table.andP;  A document containing aspreadsheet element includes the underlying spreadsheet model (the formulasthat inter-relate cells) in addition to the cell values.andP;  This featureenables the recipient of a message containing a spreadsheet to do &quot;what if&quot;experiments with the spreadsheet table.andP;  For an example, see Figure 5.andM;Charts.andP;  Line, bar, and pie charts based on values in a spreadsheet may beincluded in a Slate document.andP;  As values in the spreadsheet change, therepresentation of those values in charts changes.andP;  Note the example in figure6.andM;Images.andP;  A Slate image element is a bitmap representation (a digitized image)of a drawing, map, photograph, or other picture.andP;  Images are entered into thesystem by a scanner such as a digital facsimile machine or a digitizingcamera, by importing a raster file, or by &quot;painting&quot; an image with the Statemultimedia editor.andP;  Both black-and-white and 8-bit color images are currentlysupported.andP;  The image shown in Figure 7 was imported from an 8-bit color GIFfile (rendered in gray-scale on black-and-white output devices).andP;  Images mayalso be combined with geometric graphics for annotation purposes.andM;Speech.andP;  Voice annotations may be inserted so tht any reviewer of a Slatedocument can make comments about desired changes.andP;  A voice element is adigitized speech passage, entered into documents by means of a speech serverdevice.andP;  Slate currently uses a speech server based on the NaturalMicrosystems Watson and VBX speech boards to digitize and compress speech.andP;  Asimple control panel, resembling that found on a portable tape recorder isused to enter and edit speech (see Figure 8).andP;  For presentation purposes,each voice element in a document is represented graphically by an icon and anassociated caption, as shown in Figure 9.andP;  A user reading a Slate documentcan hear a voice element by pointing to the icon and invoking a playbackcommand.andM;Compound Document Editors.andP;  There are two main approaches to designing acompound document editor.andP;  The first produces a tightly integrated designwith &quot;native&quot; media editors; the second produces a lossely coupled designallowing for the use of third-party or &quot;foreign&quot; editors.andP;  The secondapproach has the clear advantage of making it possible to integrate productsthat have already gained acceptance in the marketplace.andM;Based on the following set of design goals, we chose the tightly integratedapproach:andM;* Objects should be both displayed and edited in their &quot;natural&quot; form on asingle integrated display surface.andM;* The user interface should be consistent throughout.andM;* Context switching between different media editors should be simple andfast.andP;  It should not involve popping up separate windows, for example, orwaiting for another program to start up.andM;We have largely achieved these goals, but it is important to remember thatthere is no such thing as a free lunch.andP;  Some of the consequences of usingour approach include the necessity for a large editor, since the executablebinary file includes all the media editors; the extra effort required tointegrate new media editors; and the inability to easily incorporate existingthird-party editors into the Slate model.andM;Each media editor in the Slate system implements a number of genericfunctions that are invoked by the main editor framework.andP;  These includecreating new empty objects of the type needed, drawing objects at somelocation in a window, printing them, and reading them from and writing themto the filesystem.andM;The main editor framework and the generic functions provde the corecapabilities for a given media type but do not address the issue of editingthe contents of an object.andP;  Eaching media type requires a certain number ofspecific functions for contents editing (cutting a row in a spreadsheet orinserting a character in a paragraph, for instance).andP;  When an object isselected, the media type editor remaps keyboard commands to media-specificfunctions.andP;  This allows media editing functions to be invoked throughkeyboard commands or menu selection.andM;There is some gray area between the tightly and loosely integrated approachesto designing compound document editors.andP;  BBN/Slate provides an enclosurefacility that allows arbitrary datat to be included with a document formailing or filing purposes.andP;  The data can be written to the filesystem, or anapplication program can be directly invoked on it, from within the editor.andO;This permits some unexpected uses; for example, we can include references tovideo sequences in a document and directly play them from within the editor.andM;Multimedia Communications in Collaborative Work.andP;  As mentioned earlier,BBN/Slate was developed to support collaborative projects and, to that end,places greate emphasis on communications functions.andP;  There are two distinctbut related mechanisms for collaborative work within the system: electronicmail and electronic teleconferencing.andM;The control panel shown in Figure 10 gives BBN/Slate users a clean interfaceto the host mail transport system (usually sendmail or MMDF on UNIX systems)and allows them to mail Slate multimedia documents via any SMTP (Simple MailTransport Protocol) mail system.andP;  In addition, the control panel gives usersa view into the document storage hierarchy without requiring them to have anydetailed knowledge of the underlying filesystem.andP;  Collections of relateddocuments are stored in folders, and the Mailbox folder is the repository forall incoming mail messages.andM;The Slate multimedia conferencing system allows people working ongeographically distributed machines to view and modify Slate multimediadocuments as a group.andP;  At the end of a conference session, participants havelocal copies of all documents showing all the changes made during theconference.andM;During the conference itself, only one partiicpant at a time has the &quot;floor&quot;:only that participant can make changes in documents.andP;  All participants seethe changes in real time on their workstations, however.andP;  Other participantscan &quot;request&quot; the floor by simply taking some specified action within theeditor window.andP;  &quot;Flor changes&quot; are effected quickly and automatically,allowing smooth changes in contorl--in the same way that control passes backand forth in a face-to-face or telephone conversation.andP;  Providing for &quot;floorcontrol&quot; was necessary to ensure that all copies of the editor running in theconference see the same sequence of events and provide the same view ofdocuments.andP;  It means users have a shared context that allows them to discussand modify documents as if they were looking at the same screen.andM;Electronic mail and teleconferencing are the mechanisms for collaborativework; the multimedia capabilities of BBN/Slate allow the material that is theobject of collaborative work to be richer and more complete than is possibleusing text-only electronic mail.andP;  Anyone who has ever spent any time at allworking with colleagues over an electronic mail network will be familiar withmessages like: &quot;Here's the text of my paper for your comments--you can seethe figures when I mail you the final paper copy.&quot;andP;  Without multimediacapabilities, figures and drawings, which are often critical to the clarityof a document, are left out of electric collaborations.andM;Finally, a system that supports electronic collaboration has to deal with thereality that not everyone with whom a given user wishes to collaborate usesthe same computer system.andP;  One way bBN/Slate deals with this reality is bymaking the interworking of text and multimedia mail transparent.andP;  Both aredeposited in the same folder and are manipulated by the user in the same way.andO;When a document is transmitted, the system automatically determines whetherthe addresses can receive only text mail and, when necessary, converts theoutgoing message to a text-only form.andP;  In the future, multimedia documentstandards like the Office Document Architecture (ODA) may help make itpossible for different multimedia document systems to interwork.andP;  Widedifferences in system capabilities, however, along with continuingdisagreemente over a general multimedia document architecture, dims theprospect that such standards will be widely used in the near future.andM;The Programmer's Multimedia Workbench.andP;  Besides providing a developmentplatform for the BBN/Slate system, UNIX also provided us with a philosophywhich holds that tools should be designed to be open and capable ofinteracting with tools from other systems, and that &quot;tiny lanaguages&quot; can bea powerful method for users to customize a system in new and unexpected ways.andO;A number of features of the BBN/Slate system have made it possible tointegrate it into other systems and use it in ways that its developers couldnot have predicted.andM;The external document format is published and is generally human-readable(for efficiency's sake, speech data and images are stored in binary form).andO;This makes it easy for other applications to generate multimedia documents astheir output.andP;  Existing applications include a program that generates a sitemap from database information and one that takes the textual output of asystem-usage reporting program and transforms it into grahical form.andP;  In bothcases, the document, once generated, can be directly manipulated and viewedon the screen with the editor, or mailed to another user.andM;The editor implements a general-purpose programming language, the SlateExtension Language (SEL), for writing extensions and customizations.andP;  SELincludes standard programming-language constructs that include variables,function definitions, and control flow.andP;  It also provides access to low-leveleditor primitives such as inserting and deleting characters, searching,changing fonts, editing formats, adding graphical features, manipulatingimages and spreadsheets, managing multiple documents, and interacting withthe user.andP;  User-defined functions can be boundto arbitrary key sequences orto customizable menus.andM;SEL allows an individual user to customize the editor interface to a highdegree.andP;  By also providing a mechanism for driving the editor under programcontrol, it is possible to use the editor as an element of other systems.andO;The editor provides a display and editing engine for multimedia documentsthat can be customized for the particular application.andP;  In one multimediadocument application for database entry, it is used in concert with severalother programs to display multimedia documents and allow the user to scrollthrough them and select terms for keyword indexing.andP;  Extension-languagefunctions interact with the user and send selected information back to thecontrolling program.andM;The most important lesson we have learned in designing &quot;collaboration toosl&quot;is that people want to use the tools they are familiar with.andP;  There is nopoint in creating tools for information sharing without also providing toolsfor users who are working in isolation.andP;  Power is achieved by building asystem that gracefully expands across the spectrum, from a user working aloneto a group collaborating across time and space or interacting in real timeover a shared multimedia workspace.andM;In the future, our work will be oriented toward better understanding theactual processes involved in human interaction and supporting those processesdirectly.andP;  For example, two people working on a paper together have differentrequirements depending on whether they are equal co-authors, author andeditor, or author and reviewer.andP;  Understanding these relationships andproviding direct support for them will result in systems that more closelysatisfy users' needs.andM;Herb Lison, a senior scientist at BBN Systems and Technologies Corp., hasworked as a developer and product manager on the BBN/Slate project for thepast two years.andP;
