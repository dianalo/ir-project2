<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0885 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new photograph and some spectra have been obtained for the group ofHH objects HH 52, 53, 54. A long, gaseous streamer extends from HH 54and produces an appearance very similar to that of HH 12. The spectraprovide some additional radial velocities and line-intensity measurementsfor the group. It is confirmed that HH 54D is a star with no unusualphotometric or spectroscopic characteristics. Attention is drawn to thedistance of 400 pc derived by FitzGerald (1974, 1976) for a globule inthe Cha II cloud, and it is suggested that the whole complex of gas,dust, and stars may well be further away than the 140 pc generally assumed.The spatial and velocity characteristics of this group of HH objectsare discussed. The data do not support the identifications proposed bySandell et al. (1987) as sources for the observed flows. 32 references.</TEXT></DOC>
