At her long hall of an office onLeipzigerstrasse, she talks in low tones about &quot;our work&quot;with conviction that makes it easy to see why some Germansrefer to her as their &quot;Frau Thatcher.&quot;   Mrs. Breuel says she respects Mrs. Thatcher -- &quot;she issomeone who realized her goals.&quot; But despite the likeness,the head of the Treuhand may go down in history as &quot;FrauKeynes.&quot; Much of her success to date is the result of agovernment-fueled boomlet.

But that bridge may welllead to years on the dole. The Kohl government, worried forits future, is using the Treuhand and vehicles like it towiden its manangement of the economy.   The way the Treuhand (pronounced &quot;TROY-hont&quot;) works alsohas serious consequences for the international economy.Recent growth has led some observers to argue that Germany isset for a surge on the order of its postwar Economic Miracle,which converted a ruin of a country into an economicpowerhouse. But others argue that the social welfareorientation of the Treuhand and other agencies is likely tobring about strong recession. In 1991 and 1992, the Kohlgovernment is spending $200 billion on welfare, subsidies,grants, loans and infrastructure in Eastern Germany. Aburdened German economy could in turn drag down the rest ofEurope.   &quot;What the Treuhand is doing now is disguised industrialpolicy&quot; says Thomas Mayer, a German who watches the Germaneconomy from London for Goldman Sachs. &quot;Despite what thehistory of East Germany taught the world about centralplanning, the German government is now slowly abandoning thefree market and adopting an interventionist approach.&quot;   Calling on Mrs. Breuel at the Treuhand feels like callingon an outpost of capitalism in a new frontier. Taxi upon taxipushes its way through the construction site that is nowcentral Berlin to drop off visitors at the institution'sfront gate. Bespectacled alumni of international law firmsand investment-house training programs man phones and faxmachines. Unlike most government office heads in Germany, whomust work with a competent but legalistic staff of civilservants, Mrs. Breuel has a free hand in picking her team.And unlike most bureaucracies, the Treuhand faces the healthychallenge of certain death. Mrs. Breuel herself publiclypromises that her offices will close within four years. Saysone employee: &quot;The Treuhand isn't Germany. It is a foreigncountry.&quot;   Sit down with one of Mrs. Breuel's officers, though, and adifferent story emerges. Christian Mittweg faces the job ofbreaking up a factory that makes heavy equipment for thesteel industry. The factory has a tremendous asset -- acresof prime real estate right by an international airport,Berlin's Schoenefeld.   The logical step would be for Mr. Mittweg to sell the landto the highest bidder. But Treuhand policy requires him toconcentrate first on restructuring the concern. This isdespite the overcapacity of the European steel industry --and despite the loss of 60%-70% of the factory's businesswith the decline its old East Bloc customers. The goal here:Preserve some 2,000 jobs.   Thus a potentially valuable project like this one becomesa social welfare caseone of the beneficiaries of nearly $20billion a year the federal government is spending to keepTreuhand charges alive. Says Mr. Mittweg: &quot;In Central Europe,every employer is a social worker.&quot; For those employees whoare laid off, Germany's &quot;Sozialamt,&quot; its welfare agency,occasionally sets up temporary offices in the basements ofthe firms doing the layoffs.   That philosophy applies to most of the 5,000 or soconcerns the Treuhand must yet unload. A March amendment toGerman property law made it simpler to clear title in themurky world of East German property. But to succeed in apurchase, an outside bidder must present a proposal that theTreuhand deems competitive. &quot;Competitive&quot; often means that itwill guarantee jobs and commit not to resell the land for upto 10 years. The Treuhand also looks for capital commitments,and, most dauntingly, for buyers who will make a similarproduct to that manufactured at the purchase site in theyears of East Germany's fantasy economy.   These criteria can all be waived. But as points ofdeparture, they reflect the Treuhand's philosophy. SaysUlrike Gruenrock, an assistant vice president at the agency:&quot;price is not the main thing.&quot; The attitude is one thatradically diminishes the Treuhand's income. In today'sservice-oriented economy, an unreconstructed and pollutedrust-belt like Eastern Germany has only one asset beyond itsworkforce -- real estate.   The Treuhand also demonstrates a rather old-fashioned(some might call it Marxist) proclivity to assign high valueto factories and machinery. The result sometimes produces&quot;prices&quot; that do not jibe with reality. In one famous slip,the agency unloaded a Berlin electromechanical supplier,Geraetewerk Teltow, for the token fee of one mark. Berlintoday is a boomtown with property prices comparable to thosein Manhattan. But the agency focused so much on the socialcosts the new buyers would have to carry that it forgot tocalculate in the value of the Berlin real estate. Mrs. Breuelfor her part reminds a visitor that her job is making &quot;atransition to a social market economy.&quot;   That assessment is one that is shared by a Germanpopulation deeply concerned with preserving Germany's socialwelfare net. When the Treuhand negotiated the sale of one ofthe biggest concerns in its basket, the Hennigsdorf steelmill, to the Italian Riva Group, the local press reacted withprotectionist outcries. Union-led workers occupied the plant,claiming that a German bidder would keep more jobs. But theTreuhand notes that Riva was the only one willing to make acommitment on paper to preserving jobs.   Underlying both the protest and the Treuhand's defense isa deep-seated hostility to the very instinct that many arguewould save Eastern Germany: the profit motive. Germany'sconstitution, the Grundgesetz, says &quot;property obligates&quot; --that is, it is a landlord or owner's job to take care oftenants and employees. But, observers point out, things weredifferent in postwar Germany. Then the federal governmentfocused on the economy first, strengthening itssocial-welfare net only after some measure of prosperity hadarrived. &quot;The difference between the late 1940s and the early1990s is that the German Bundestag then recognized theprimacy of free enterprise,&quot; says Dennis Bark, co-author of ahistory of postwar Germany. &quot;In the early 1990s, therefore,the Treuhand is being asked to put the cart at the startinggate with the horse.&quot;   For some investors, including the 13 American companiesthat have bought through the Treuhand, this attitude is not adisadvantage. Daniel Industries, a Houston-based supplier offluid measurement products, spent $4.4 million in December topurchase a company in suburban Berlin that makes similardevices. Its goal: serving &quot;Western and East Europeanmarkets.&quot; For the Germans, the change was welcome -- theirold Eastern European customers had so little cash &quot;that theyarrived here and tried to buy our goods with baskets oftomatoes,&quot; says Karl Goetze, director of the firm. Mrs.Breuel for her part argues opportunity is ripe for foreigninvestment. &quot;Where else in the European market is there achance to participate with up to 50% subsidy?&quot; she asks.   Companies like Daniel will benefit from Germany'sextensive outlays on infrastructure. Deutsche Bank figuresshow public job programs, known as &quot;employment companies&quot; areretraining some 200,000 East Germans. That costs a lot --beneficiaries are paid on Germany's high union scale. It alsodisguises German unemployment figures. But it does giveEastern Germany's workforce a boost over Polish or Czechcompetitors.   Much of the current predicament, too, is not theTreuhand's fault. Back when the Treuhand got started in 1990,planners thought Eastern Europe would be a natural market forgoods from the new Eastern Germany. For now, that source hasdried up, a victim of political chaos. Within Germany, muchof the blame can be assigned to the chancellor, Helmut Kohl.During his campaign in 1990, he pushed up the price of laborwhen he overrode the Bundesbank and gave East Germans a 1-1exchange rate for their East German marks. Poor results instate elections in the West early last year have driven himto widen public spending for his Eastern constituents. So hasfear of social unrest -- and fear of the kind of left-wingterrorism that took the life of Mrs. Breuel's predecessor atthe Treuhand, Detlev Rohwedder. The Kohl government haschosen to spend its way to safety. &quot;Germany grows together.Your pension grows with it,&quot; read billboard advertisementsfor Mr. Kohl's party in the East.   The result of heavy government involvement, says ThomasMayer of Goldman Sachs, is to prolong the process ofintegration. &quot;Without government doing the privatization, thecrash would have come earlier and harder. But the upswingwould have come faster, too.&quot; Many contracts the Treuhand issigning include employment guarantees that run out severalyears from now -- at which time unprofitable owners arelikely to try to unload.   Asked about such consequences, the head of the Treuhand'sNew York office, Christoph Urban, dismissesfree-market-oriented criticism as &quot;purist.&quot; After all, saysMr. Urban, the Treuhand situation &quot;is no different from thechallenge America faces in the RTC.&quot; Mrs. Breuel, for herpart, says she will barrel through. Offered analogies --Keynes? Milton Friedman? -- she argues that she is likeneither. Says Birgit Breul: &quot;I am not interested in theory.&quot;   ---   Miss Shlaes is deputy features editor of The Wall StreetJournal's editorial page.</TEXT></DOC>
