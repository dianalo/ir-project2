AKRE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Booze, inexperience and complacencyconspired to cause the nation's worst oil spill, evidence andtestimony suggest after a five-day federal investigative hearingthat found plenty of blame to spread around.   The National Transportation Safety Board hearing on the ExxonValdez oil spill concluded Saturday. Board member Lee Dickinsonsaid the agency's report probably will be issued in early 1990.   The hearing came nearly two months after the tanker ran agroundon a charted reef and ripped its hull open, bleeding nearly 11million gallons of crude oil into biologically rich Prince WilliamSound. The oil has coated hundreds of miles of coast and killedbirds and marine mammals.   ``There are any number of things that may have occurred, somemistakes that were made, and all those together may have been whatled to the grounding of the Exxon Valdez,'' Dickinson said.   The 987-foot tanker was heading south from Valdez the night ofMarch 23 with a load of Alaskan crude when Capt. Joseph Hazelwooddirected it across a northbound shipping lane to avoid chunks ofice from a glacier.   The captain received Coast Guard permission for the diversion.But without approval the ship continued beyond the traffic lanes.Hazelwood handed over control to Third Mate Gregory Cousins andleft the bridge several minutes before the tanker ran aground at12:04 a.m. March 24.   In nearly 45 hours of testimony, not one of the 28 witnessesadmitted doing anything wrong. But their testimony and more than1,000 pages of evidence implicate the following players:   _Hazelwood, who has been charged with operating the ship whiledrunk and declined to testify because of his pending criminaltrial. Testimony indicated he may have had a blood-alcohol level of0.22 percent at the time of the wreck, five times the legal limit.Witnesses said they smelled alcohol on his breath before and afterthe wreck.   The captain also left Cousins in charge, knowing he was notcertified to pilot the ship through the sound. And Hazelwood hadthe tanker on automatic pilot although company policy restricts useof the device to open water.   _Cousins, who took the ship off automatic pilot 12 minutesbefore the crash but failed to turn the vessel away from BlighReef. He testified that the ship didn't respond to his rudderchanges, but an on-board recorder indicated his turns were simplytoo late.   _Exxon Shipping Co., which was aware of Hazelwood's alcoholismbut said it was unaware he had resumed drinking after undergoinghospital treatment in 1985. Although the company president saidExxon has a strict anti-drinking policy, employees testified theyrarely saw evidence that the policy was enforced.   Testimony also revealed that Exxon had reduced its tanker crewsin favor of increased automation.   _Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., operator of the Alaskan oilpipeline and the Valdez terminal, which failed to respond asquickly to the disaster as it had estimated it would in itsspill-contingency plan. A barge used to carry equipment to thespill was empty when the ship ran aground, and it took 10 hours toload it.   _The Coast Guard's radar ship-monitoring system. Trafficcontrollers in Valdez testified the ship was not visible on radarafter it left Valdez Narrows. They blamed weather for decreasingthe radar's range that night.   Witnesses were questioned by NTSB staffers and representativesof the Coast Guard, state, Exxon and Alyeska. Participants wereaware their testimony may be admitted in court, where Exxon andAlyeska face potentially huge liability costs.   Government and industry officials tried to use the hearing totheir best legal and political advantage.   Exxon's William Deppe and Alyeska's William Howitt worked toelicit testimony that would show their companies did everythingpossible to avoid and then respond to the disaster.   Through their questions they suggested that the spill was beyondcontainment, that government got in the way and that the spillmight have been avoided if the Coast Guard radar had been workingproperly.   State officials alleged the industry was unprepared for a largespill, failed to follow its contingency plans and allowedconditions that led to the spill to go unchecked.</TEXT></DOC>
