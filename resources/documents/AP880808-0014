WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis' challenge to debate George Bushon foreign policy and defense is the Democratic presidentialnominee's confident counterattack in an area that could be either aweakness or a weapon for him.   Dukakis' staff seemed taken aback by Bush's claim last week thatDukakis would unilaterally disarm the nation, an unusuallyaggressive attack at this early stage of the general electioncampaign.   ``Shrill'' was the way Dukakis described it as he delivered aseries of escalating responses ending in the call for amid-September debate on the issue.   It had already been clear, however, that Bush would strive topaint Dukakis as inexperienced and out of step on national securitymatters as the vice president moved to recover from a substantialdeficit in the polls.   Foreign policy, defense and national security concerns arewidely regarded as the weakest areas for Dukakis for a variety ofreasons. It is the one area in which Dukakis, a statehousepolitician, has no record. And despite his familiarity with severallanguages, Dukakis is not a veteran traveler to foreign capitals.   Bush, for all his image problems, can point to his experience inthe international arena even before his vice presidency asambassador to China and CIA director.   But Dukakis has been hammering away at Bush on the foreignaffairs missteps of the Reagan administration. The Dukakis campaignclearly believes that Bush is vulnerable on the Iran-Contra affair,dealings with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, the Pentagoncontracting scandal and other problems.   Dukakis raised that criticism to a new level on Friday whilecampaigning in California when he said Bush doesn't ``have what ittakes'' to run the country.   ``Anybody who sits there and does nothing while we trade arms tothe Ayatollah, and says he didn't know that Noriega was doing drugsand running drugs (and) is a suspected murderer, and went to thePhilippines in the early '80s and commended (Ferdinand) Marcos forhis commitment to democracy, in my judgment doesn't have what ittakes to lead this country when it comes to foreign policy,''Dukakis said.   A day earlier, however, Dukakis had fed the impression he couldmisstep on military issues when he was questioned about Bush'scharges. Asked initially if he still supported a nuclear freeze,which was debated before arms reduction talks began in 1985,Dukakis responded ``sure.''   Moments later aboard his campaign jet, Dukakis aides hastilyarranged a news conference and brought the candidate back to wherereporters were sitting on the plane. There, when asked, heclarified his response and said that the issue had moved beyond thequestion of a nuclear freeze to that of arms reductions.   ``The reason we were all for the freeze originally was becausewe wanted to stop the administration from expanding the arsenal,''Dukakis said. He said that had changed now that negotiationscentered on reductions.   ``Did I favor the freeze? Sure. I'm for reductions now. So's theadministration,'' he said. ``I'm for developing certain weaponssystems (and) for substantially reducing others.''   In attacking the Democratic nominee, Bush pointed to Dukakis'opposition to some new systems, particularly land-based nuclearweapons. Dukakis has said he doesn't rule out modernization of theland-based arsenal _ that is, producing a new type of missile. Yethe opposes current options _ the MX and the smaller Midgetman.   Dukakis aides point to his support for other systems, such asthe new Trident submarine-based missile and cruise missiles, andfor development of the bomb-carrying Stealth aircraft.   Dukakis generally prefers to talk about his plans to beef upconventional forces, although he has not been specific on how topay for expensive upgrades in equipment, weaponry, supplies andtraining. It is on conventional forces that he can be expected tofocus if he gets that debate with Bush.</TEXT><TEXT>   _   EDITOR'S NOTE _ William M.
