DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of recovering drug addicts and theirsupporters marched to the Statehouse demanding drug treatment ondemand and chanting ``We want what Kitty got.''   The advocates charged Wednesday that, contrary to assertions byGov. Michael S. Dukakis during his presidential campaign, drugprograms in Massachusetts reach only a fraction of those in need.   ``Governor Dukakis, we are here to call you on your promise. Wewant treatment now,'' Gregory Davis, a recovering addict who headsMetro Boston Alive, told the rally on the Statehouse steps. He saidaddicts are not interested in clean needles or methadone but dowant treatment.   Davis reminded his listeners that during the presidentialcampaign, Dukakis said no addict in Massachusetts seeking helpwould be denied. State officials concede that only about 4,500addicts are in treatment on a given day, out of an estimated 40,000addicts statewide.   But Dukakis administration officials note that public andprivate programs combined handle some 20,000 admissions a year.They say they are seeking funds to achieve the goal of treatment ondemand.   Public Health Commissioner Deborah Prothrow-Stith drew cheerswhen she told the crowd that the number of addicts in treatment hasrisen in two years from 7,000 to 15,000.   ``Everybody deserves treatment when they need it,'' she said.``We've come a pretty long way.''   The advocates, however, booed and jeered her superior, HumanServices Secretary Philip Johnston. Johnston, who was representingDukakis, who was nearly drowned out by chants, ``Put your moneywhere your mouth is.''   After accepting some 2,500 petitions favoring treatment ondemand, Johnston tried to assure the crowd that Dukakis considersdrug treatment a top priority.   Throughout the rally, advocates chanted ``We want what Kittygot'' _ referring to the governor's wife, Kitty Dukakis, who hasacknowledged a lifelong chemical dependency.   She was treated for addiction to amphetamines five years ago andspent the month of February in a private, residential treatmentprogram in Rhode Island to address an alcohol problem that flaredup after her husband lost the presidential election.</TEXT></DOC>
