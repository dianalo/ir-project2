Last year, he says, U.S. multinationals tended to keep overseas earnings denominated in foreign currencies for as long as possible, betting that the dollar would decline further. &quot;Now, there's a good proportion of hedging going on.&quot;    On Friday, the dollar surged to its 1988 highs against the Japanese yen and West German mark, on news of a seasonally adjusted $10.93 billion U.S. trade deficit for May, narrower than expected. &quot;We feel we've already seen the dollar's lows,&quot; says Howard Sheppard, an assistant treasurer at Chevron Corp. The latest trade report &quot;fortifies the position that the dollar is in an upward trend,&quot; adds Jim Lyness, another Chevron treasury official.    The switch in thinking on the dollar isn't absolute. Some big exporters, such as Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co., remain concerned that the dollar could fall further. The dollar rallied for a couple of months last year before resuming its drop, observes Roger Roberts, a vice president, finance, at 3M. Mr. Roberts also remains unconvinced that the U.S. trade and budget deficits are narrowing significantly.    Still, last year's widespread pessimism about the dollar's course appears to be abating a bit among corporate treasurers. Since Jan. 1, the dollar has risen about 11% against the yen, and about 18% against the mark. That's the most-sustained rally for the U.S. currency since it began falling in early 1985.    Even with the recent gains, the dollar hasn't begun to approach its highs of three years ago. The exchange rate of 135.45 yen late Friday in New York, for example, is up noticeably from 121 yen at the start of the year, but well below the 1985 high of 262 yen.    The dollar's recovery reflects several factors. First, central banks early in the year signaled that they didn't want the dollar to drop further. Also, a modest narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit has made bank traders and international investors more willing to own dollars. Furthermore, healthy U.S. economic growth has kept U.S. interest rates high enough to attract foreign capital.    As multinational companies become less eager to hold foreign currencies, that could give the dollar a further boost, traders say. But they caution that corporate attitudes haven't pivoted overnight. &quot;There's been a shift, but it's gradual,&quot; says a Swiss bank trader. Corporate attitudes toward the dollar &quot;seem split 50-50 now, after all being bearish a year ago,&quot; he adds.    On the sidelines are such companies as Digital Equipment Corp. &quot;We don't feel we're in a position to second-guess the market,&quot; says a Digital spokeswoman. &quot;Our strength is selling computers, not being in the foreign-currency markets.&quot; Many other multinational companies price their exports in dollars, so they needn't worry so much about currency fluctuations.    In New York, International Paper Co. says, &quot;Every invoice billed in a foreign currency is hedged.&quot; That might suggest a bullish view on the dollar, though an International Paper spokesman says it's been the company's policy for some time.    As for imports of paper-mill equipment, mostly from West Germany and Finland, International Paper generally has hedged foreign-currency outlays over cycles as long as three years. But with the mark weakening lately, &quot;it would be imprudent not to constantly evaluate those strategies,&quot; the spokesman says.    At Chevron, world-wide foreign-exchange exposure totals $1 billion annually. The largest share of that is in British pounds, mainly because of a tax on North Sea oil production, payable in sterling. Chevron in recent years had tried to lock in United Kingdom exchange rates ahead of time, for fear the pound would strengthen further. But this year, the company isn't hedging much, figuring it might get a more-favorable exchange rate later.    A company with a more-limited bullish view on the dollar is Bethlehem Steel Corp. Most of its exports are priced in dollars, except for a tin mill that makes shipments to Mexico. In that case, says Robert Rudzki, a manager of banking at Bethlehem, his company likes to switch payments out of pesos and into dollars as quickly as possible.    Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.8805 marks, its high for the day, and up sharply from 1.8508 marks late Thursday. The dollar was quoted at 135.45 yen, also an intraday high, and up from 133.23 yen late Thursday.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 135.35 yen.    On Friday, the dollar rose sharply against the pound, prompting talk of another move by the Bank of England to raise British banks' base lending rate from the present 10%. Late Friday in New York, the pound was at $1.6615, down from $1.6852 late Thursday.    On the New York Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $440.20 an ounce, up $1.50. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong on Monday, gold was quoted at $438.80 an ounce.    ---               LATE NEW YORK TRADING               Friday, July 15, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
