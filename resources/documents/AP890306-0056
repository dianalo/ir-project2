Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi of Sudan decided Sunday to bow topressure from politicians and army officers, and declared he willform a new government to negotiate an end to the nearly 6-year-oldwar in the south.   William Young, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees in Uganda,said that by Sunday 17,000 refugees had arrived at Bibia and another6,000 at Kitgum, communities just south of the Ugandan border.   ``The refugees, who include a small number of soldiers, abandonedthe border town of Nimule on Friday after learning that (John)Garang's forces were about to storm the town,'' Young said.   Garang is leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army,which wants greater autonomy for southern Sudan's Christians andanimists. They are a majority in the south but are far outnumberedby the dominant Moslems of the north who control the government andeconomy.   The clandestine rebel radio Saturday said its fighters overranNimule Friday. Early last week, the rebels appealed to governmenttroops in Nimule and other southern towns to evacuate or join therebels.   Nimule straddles the Ugandan border and controls the main roadleading north to Juba, besieged capital of the southernmost Sudaneseprovince of Equatoria.   Last week, the U.N. refugees' organization completed evacuating3,000 Sudanese refugees who had been camping at Kitgum sinceOctober. The earlier arrivals were transferred to Adjumani, 300miles northwest of Kampala, because of fighting between Ugandanrebels and government forces.   Young said his organization is meeting Ugandan officials thisweek to determine whether the new arrivals also should betransferred to a safer location.   Sudanese soldiers among the new refugees were taken to a separatecamp, he said. He declined to say how many military personnel wereamong the refugees.   Young said the new refugees will need 10 tons of food a day. TheFrench government has chartered a plane to bring in food, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
