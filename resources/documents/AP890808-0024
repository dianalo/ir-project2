The $81 million H-1 rocket, capable of sending a 1,200-poundsatellite into geostationary orbit, failed to lift off at theNational Space Development Agency on Tanegashima Island, 616 milessouthwest of Tokyo, said NASDA spokesman Junji Oda.   It was the space agency's first failure in 20 rocket launchingssince the agency successfully sent up the N-1 type rocket in 1975,Oda said.   He said the reason for the mishap was unknown.   ``We fired the first stage, but something happened before itreached the second stage and it was automatically stopped. Atpresent we don't know what it was,'' Oda said.   Kishiro Nakamura, head of the Science and Technology Agency,said he will seek a prompt report on the cause of the failure.   ``The accident happened at a time when we have just started toput more effort into space development. We have to be able to earnthe public's understanding and trust in space development,''Nakamura said.   Before starting an investigation into the causes of the failure,the agency has to extract fuel and other materials from the rocketto avoid an explosion, Oda said.   If the trouble is not too serious and can be fixed ``without toomuch effort,'' another trial could be possible by the end ofSeptember, he said.   The H-1 rocket carries the No. 4 weather satellite, which willreplace the current weather satellite known as ``Himawari No. 3,''or ``Sunflower No. 3.'' The present satellite is capable ofpursuing its mission for another year or so, according to Oda.   The launch was originally scheduled for Aug. 1, but it waspostponed twice by bad weather.</TEXT></DOC>
