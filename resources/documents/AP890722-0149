ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. expectto win their takeover fight with Paramount Communications Inc. andmerge as planned, but it's not certain the combination will shieldthem from another hostile bid.   Time and Paramount officials have said the sheer size of themerged company, Time Warner Inc., would not protect it from attack.But securities analysts say potential bidders likely would bediscouraged by the enormous debt that will burden Time after thedeal.   The Delaware Supreme Court was scheduled to hear argumentsMonday in Paramount's appeal of a lower court ruling allowing theTime-Warner deal to proceed.   Legal scholars, analysts and investors generally expected thestate's highest court to uphold the July 14 decision that saidParamount and Time shareholders have no right to block the merger.   That decision has been widely viewed as an important affirmationof a company's right to shape its long-term business strategy,regardless of what shareholders want.   The Delaware Supreme Court's ruling could come right after thehearing. That would allow Time to complete its $14 billion tenderoffer for Warner as scheduled at 5 p.m EDT Monday.   Delaware has jurisdiction in the case because, like most majorU.S. companies, Time, Warner and Paramount all are incorporated inthe tiny state, which historically has offered low taxes andliberal business laws.   Paramount said prior to the hearing that the Time-Warner dealwould thwart any rival bidders, even those willing to pay $200 ashare, the amount Paramount has offered for Time.   ``That of course includes us,'' Paramount stated.   But in testimony in the court battle in Delaware, ParamountChairman Martin Davis, Time President N.J. Nicholas Jr. and TimeVice Chairman Jerry Levin, among others, said Time would not betotally secure after acquiring Warner.   Some observers believe that despite Paramount's protests, thecompany may be considering an offer for Time Warner in the future.Others doubt anyone will make a run at Time Warner, at least notimmediately.   ``Theoretically they are (open to attack), but practically, Ithink it would be difficult,'' said Fred Anschel, an analyst withDean Witter Reynolds Inc.   PaineWebber Inc. analyst J. Kendrick Noble said the magnitude ofthe Time Warner marriage and the resulting debt that Time willoccur make the possibility of a takeover ``highly remote.''   Theories have been floated around Wall Street that someone couldbid for Time Warner, then pare unwanted assets to defray the costsof the transaction in the strategy commonly known as the leveragedbuyout.   But there's a big drawback to that idea: Any asset sales wouldgive an acquirer a big tax bill that would eat into the proceeds.   ``A raider probably would not get his money back,'' Noble said.   Published reports last week said Time and Warner were themselvesconsidering the sale of some assets, including Time's Scott,Foresman andamp; Co., a book publisher, to help finance their merger.   ``We have not publicly revealed what assets if any, the combinedcompanies will sell,'' said Time spokesman Edward Adler, callingthe reports of possible sales ``hypothetical strategies.''   How much it would cost to buy Time Warner depends ultimately onhow much cash Time pays for Warner. Time will pay $70 per share incash for half of Warner's 200 million outstanding shares in thetender offer scheduled to expire Monday, and $70 in a combinationof cash and securities for the remaining shares in what is calledthe deal's ``back end.''   Time says it does not expect to announce how much cash andsecurities the back end will contain _ or whether Time will have toissue new common stock _ until some time, perhaps several months,after the tender offer expires. That means the exact cost of themerger and the amount of Time Warner's debt is yet to be determined.   But the cost of a Time Warner buyout would be stratospheric and``will almost certainly require a combination of parties, includingpossibly an LBO type of firm,'' Anschel said.   He projected the Time Warner debt at $11 billion to $12 billion.A bid matching Paramount's $200 a share offer would cost $12.2billion, and could go higher.   Between the cost of the shares and the debt, ``you're talking$25 billion,'' Anschel said.   There is still the problem of servicing that debt after a buyoutis accomplished.   ``I'm not sure it's too likely near term,'' Anschel said of aTime Warner bid.   Ever since Time and Warner announced plans to merge last March,Wall Street expected someone to make a pitch for one or both firms,and after Paramount launched its bid June 6, rumors flew about abid for that company too.   No other bidders have emerged, but some observers are waiting tosee what might happen after Delaware's court rules.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs July 24</NOTE></DOC>
