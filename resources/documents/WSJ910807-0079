Two people will take over the posts from which Mr.Seidman, 70 years old, has supervised the closings of morethan 1,500 banks and thrifts. Last year, President Bushmentioned William Taylor, the head of bank supervision at theFederal Reserve Board, as a candidate to succeed Mr. Seidmanat the FDIC, which handles bank failures, regulates mostlysmall banks and operates the bank insurance fund. Theadministration has set up a committee to look for a newchairman for the RTC, which sells off assets of insolventthrifts.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, Mr. Bush told reporters in Kennebunkport,Maine, &quot;we're not speculating&quot; about a successor to Mr.Seidman. &quot;The fix is not on,&quot; he said.   Nevertheless, administration officials said that Mr.Taylor remains the likely candidate to succeed Mr. Seidmandespite some congressional concern that Mr. Taylor's Feddivision hasn't adequately policed the Bank of Commerce andamp;Credit International, which has been accused of massive fraudand wrongdoing.   &quot;There is a strong suspicion that the Federal Reservefailed miserably to meet its responsibility to monitor andregulate BCCI's activities in the U.S.,&quot; House BankingCommittee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said recently.In congressional testimony, Mr. Taylor and other Fedofficials have strongly defended their efforts to curb BCCI'sactivities in the U.S.   Mr. Taylor, 51, began his career as a bank examiner at theFed and then worked at a bank and a real estate developmentcompany before returning to the government. He is known as atough regulator, and in recent years state banks regulated bythe Fed and the FDIC have had a lower failure rate thannational banks regulated by the comptroller of the currency.   The search for Mr. Seidman's successor at the ResolutionTrust Corp. has just begun and could be difficult. To a greatextent, the sweeping Sandamp;L cleanup law was fashioned two yearsago around Mr. Seidman, whose unflappable demeanor earnedrespect on Capitol Hill. The law gave Mr. Seidman, thebanking regulator, the added job of managing and disposing ofhundreds of failed Sandamp;Ls.   Since then, while many members of Congress have criticizedthe RTC, few have admonished Mr. Seidman. His successor isn'tlikely to have such a reservoir of trust and good will. &quot;Hewill be difficult to replace,&quot; said Senate Banking CommitteeChairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.).   Treasury officials have mentioned Gerald Greenwald, aformer Chrysler Corp. executive who helped preside over theauto maker's federal bailout, as a possible candidate to runthe RTC, but Mr. Greenwald hasn't commented on thepossibility. Congress could also look to a current regulatorsuch as Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities andExchange Commission, or Timothy Ryan, director of the Officeof Thrift Supervision.   Mr. Seidman's successors will face huge problems. Banksand thrifts continue to fail at a rapid rate. The bankinsurance fund is nearly out of money, and Congress isexpanding its borrowing authority by $70 billion so it willhave the funds to handle bank failures. The money is to bepaid back by the banking industry. In addition, Congress thisfall must vote on a further $80 billion to finance the Sandamp;Lbailout.   It's not even clear to whom the new RTC chief --envisioned as a strong executive with experience in realestate or liquidation -- will answer. Congress may streamlinethe multilayered RTC oversight bureaucracy to involve feweragencies.   Mr. Seidman, who has been FDIC chief since 1985, had saidfor months that he planned to retire before his term expiresin October, but he didn't set a date. Straight-talking andpolitically savvy, he built a strong power base in Congressand befriended the press. His independence triggered anunsuccessful effort by White House Chief of Staff John Sununuto sack him last year.   Mr. Seidman said he already has started writing a bookabout his years in Washington. &quot;I've written a chapter onmistakes I've made and a chapter on pitfalls I've avoided,&quot;he said.</TEXT></DOC>
