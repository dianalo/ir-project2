The anger, however, is tempered by Israel's tradition of gainingfreedom for its captured soldiers at almost any price.   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella for groupsholding hostages, has demanded that Israel free kidnapped Shiiteclergyman Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and 450 Arab prisoners.   The prisoners include two Palestinians charged with slayingsthat caused highly emotional public outcry:   _ Nidal Zaloum, 28, stabbed two elderly Israelis to death at aJerusalem bus stop on May 3.   _ Abdel Hadi Salman Rassem Ghanem, 23, forced an Israeli businto a ravine on July 6, killing 16 people.   Israeli newspapers ran editorials and columns urging thegovernment to bargain toughly and avoid a lopsided deal like theone in 1985 in which 1,050 Palestinians were freed from jails inexchange for three Israeli soldiers.   ``Israel shall have to hold fast to its position and considerthe price so as not to repeat the mistake'' of four years ago, theliberal Haaretz daily wrote.   The right-wing Tehiya party called for a special session ofParliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee to set rules forprisoner swaps that would block such an exchange.   Ariel Merari, an expert on terrorism at Tel Aviv University,noted in an interview that many of the Palestinians set free in1985 became leaders of the Palestinian uprising against Israelioccupation, which began in December 1987. It has claimed the livesof 529 Arabs and 38 Israelis.   ``I think the government made a terrible mistake in 1985. Thiswas a trauma for Israel,'' Merari said. ``Israel paid dearly andproved a very unable negotiator.''   A similar swap this time would cause a public uproar, he said.   Some Israelis interviewed Sunday at the site where Zaloum stagedhis attack opposed a swap.   ``I am very much against it,'' said Theresa Terry, an immigrantfrom London, as she waited at the bus stop where Zaloum's victimshad sat.   ``They are criminals and murderers who shouldn't be free. It'sridiculous to even consider it. We should swap more moderatepeople,'' Mrs. Terry said.   Some analysts said that even though opinion polls show Israelisfavor a harder line toward Arabs because of the uprising, manywould ultimately support government efforts to win freedom forIsraeli soldiers captured in Lebanon.   ``People will be torn apart, but they will do it. They'll seethe families on television reuniting with their loved ones and thatwill do it. It will be accepted,'' said Eugene Weiner, asociologist at Haifa University.   Israel has a long record of freeing large numbers of Arabprisoners for small groups of soldiers. This stems from a traditionof keeping morale high in the army by making extraordinary effortsto rescue soldiers from the battlefields or enemy jails.   Since November 1983, during the Lebanon war, the government hasreleased 6,024 Arab prisoners for only 15 Israelis.   The servicemen whose return is now sought are Rahamim Alsheikhand Yossi Fink, captured near the south Lebanese village of BintJbeil in February 1986, and Ron Arad, an air force navigator whoseplane went down near Sidon in October 1986.   Aryeh Naor, a former aide to retired right-wing Prime MinisterMenachem Begin, predicted protracted negotiations but said thewar-weary public would be willing to pay the price.   ``People are sick of everything and want to see some quiet.After the 1985 deal, people get used to things,'' Naor said.   One of the Israelis who waited at the bus stop concurred. ``I amwilling to make this trade, with a heavy heart. But the mostimportant thing is for our boys to come back home,'' said YaffaPeleg, 42.</TEXT></DOC>
