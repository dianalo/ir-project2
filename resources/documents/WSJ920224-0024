This year hasbrought a 20% jump in Goulds Pumps, a Seneca Falls, N.Y.,maker of industrial pumps, but a 17% swoon in Amgen, lastyear's glamorous leader of the chic biotechnology crowd.</LP><TEXT>   The OTC market now is being buoyed by a rush for shares ofsmall-to-mediumsized companies, including shares of laggingconcerns that probably will rebound with the economy.   &quot;Some new leaders will emerge this year,&quot; among themlong-distance carrier MCI Communications, suggests MerrillLynch technical analyst George Constantine. He also has beenrecommending purchase of Goulds Pumps. Despite this year'ssurge, the stock sells at about 17 times estimated 1992earnings of $1.65 a share and, he says, has more room toclimb. &quot;The dull, mundane companies are up in spades,&quot; addsPeter Schliemann of Boston's Babson Enterprise I Fund. Hiseconomy-sensitive fund has climbed nearly 13% this year,while the big stocks in Standard andamp; Poor's 500 Index aresagging slightly.   Shares of such companies as Falcon Products, a St. Louismaker of table pedestals and other furniture for fast-foodchains, have soared 39%. After languishing last year at about$7 a share, Falcon Products took off in November when thecompany sold 1,250,000 additional shares at $8.63 each,giving big shareholders such as Babson and FidelityInvestments the opportunity to gobble up more stock (Fidelitynow has a 6.5% stake in the company).   Although the fast-food market is largely saturated withrestaurants, Mr. Schliemann notes, Falcon Products is growingrapidly as existing restaurants redecorate. The companyswoops in with pre-built furniture made at a low-cost,Mexican plant and refurbishes restaurants without theirhaving to close. He expects the company to earn 80 to 85cents a share in the fiscal year ending in November, up from69 cents a share in 1991. The stock trades at 13.5 times hisestimated earnings.   Smaller, more obscure shares are leading the OTC markethigher, outpacing larger stocks. The Russell 2000 index ofsmall stocks is up 10.8% this year and The Nasdaq CompositeIndex of more than 4,500 smaller shares is up 7.4%, but bigstocks are lagging: the Nasdaq 100 Index of large OTC stocksis up 3.5% and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index of largeshares is off more than 1.3%. That's a different pattern thanlast year, when a 65% surge in the Nasdaq 100 led the 56.8%charge in the Nasdaq Composite Index.   Shares of financial printer Merrill Corp. have climbedmore than 11% this year as investors expect the St. Paul,Minn., company to profit from the flood of companies sellingnew stock to investors. Among other documents, Merrillprepares and prints the financial and legal papers thatcompanies must circulate among prospective investors beforethey sell new stock. Merrill's shares remain attractive, saysJohn Tauer, who manages about $255 million in emerging growthstocks for Piper Capital Management of Minneapolis. AtFriday's close of 28 1/2, the stock sells at a little morethan 15 times estimated earnings of $1.85 a share for theyear ending in January 1993.   In the past year, Mr. Tauer has slashed his holdings inutility, health care and consumer-good stocks that typicallyperform well during recessions. In their place, he has loadedup on the shares of companies whose fortunes are more closelytied to the economy, among them: retailer Ross Stores ofNewark, Calif., paper manufacturer Wausau Paper Mills ofWausau, Wis., and Quality Food Centers, a Bellevue, Wash.,food retailer.   Mr. Tauer doesn't plan to jettison health care stocksentirely, although he has trimmed his medical-relatedholdings to about 13% of his total portfolio from 20%. &quot;Withthe aging of the population, we expect them to still grow,&quot;he says. Heartvalve maker St. Jude Medical remains along-term favorite. After swooning about 14% this year toFriday's close of 47, St. Jude's shares sell at about 22times estimated 1992 earnings of $2.18 a share; Mr. Tauerexpects the company to sustain a 20% or higher growth rate.   If Tokos Medical falls much further, money managerElizabeth B. Dater of E.M. Warburg, Pincus andamp; Co. says she maysnap up the stock: shares of the Santa Ana, Calif., companyhave slipped nearly 20% this year. As a provider of prenatalmonitoring at home and other health services, Tokos fits oneof Ms. Dater's investment themes: &quot;I still believe in medicalcost-containment,&quot; she says. &quot;I haven't abandoned health carestocks.&quot;   Yet she's also betting on trucker Arkansas Freightways.Since the Harrison, Ark., company recently acquired one ofits larger competitors, its earnings are expected to growabout 20% a year, she says. Its stock sells at about 20 timesanalysts' estimated 1992 earnings of $1.82 a share.   An even bigger bet on a recovering economy is VeriFone, aRedwood City, Calif., company that makes devices used toauthorize credit cards. If retail sales pick up, so willVeriFone's business, Ms. Dater notes, adding that the companydominates the world-wide market for credit-cardaccreditation. At Friday's close of 25 7/8, its stock sellsat about 25 times analysts' expected 1992 earnings of $1.03 ashare; she expects profits to grow about more than 25% ayear.   ---   Friday Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks edged lower, but traders said theactivity was skewed as investors unwound positions related tothe expiration of stock options.   The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 2.48 to 629.75, a 0.39%loss. Declining issues outpaced advancers, 1,133 to 1,098,but 154 stocks climbed to new highs as only 22 fell to newlows.

The company reportedthat fourth-quarter earnings rose to 26 cents a share fromfive cents a share a year earlier and added that it'scomfortable with estimates that it will earn $1.20 to $1.25 ashare in 1992. The Marietta, Ga., medical equipment concernsaid, however, that it may restate its 1991 earnings of 82cents a share, to reflect a charge of as much as 19 centsthat may be necessary to comply with certain accountingrules.   Zeos International lost 4 1/8 to 17 5/8. The company saidfourth-quarter earnings rose to 33 cents a share from 20cents a year earlier, but the profit trailed an estimate of37 cents a share provided by First Call, a unit of ThomsonFinancial Networks.
