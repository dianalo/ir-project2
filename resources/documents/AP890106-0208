The jury was unable to reach a verdict inthe case of E.G. ``Hop'' Barnett, the sheriff-elect.   Rainey now works as a security guard in Meridian. Barnett isretired, and Price is employed as a driver at a Philadelphiatrucking company owned by Olen Burrage, on whose land the bodieswere found.   Burrage, who was among those tried and acquitted, declined todiscuss the case, as did Barnett.   But Rainey, who is employed by a black-owned company, stillmaintains his innocence. He said the news media have alwaysportrayed him as a racist but as sheriff he merely upheld the law,as he saw it.   Rainey, who was hounded from several jobs by the NAACP, also saidhe doesn't expect ``Mississippi Burning'' will cause him anyproblems, given that he is employed by a black man now.   Carolyn Goodman, Andrew Goodman's mother, says she thinks agreater effort should be made to remember what happened inMississippi 25 years ago ``so nothing like that will ever happenagain.''   The city of Philadelphia, however, has done nothing tocommemorate the deaths. Mayor McClain says he sees no need for anyobservations or monuments ``since the victims were all outsiders.''   ``Really, there isn't much talk about what happened any more,''said Earnest Kirkland, now 55. ``The only white person who evermentioned it to me was a young boy out at the plant where I work.   ``He asked me, `Did it really happen?' I started to tell him togo ask his daddy but I just said, `Yeah, it really happened.'''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Strat Douthat is the AP Southeast regionalreporter, based in Atlanta.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 8</NOTE></DOC>
