Purchasers of goods in 46 states are obliged to pay a sales tax. The only efficient way to collect that tax is to have the merchants making those sales collect it at the time of the purchase.    Because of a 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision, those merchants that ship goods from one state to another may not be required to collect that tax. As a result of that decision, the states are currently losing over $2 billion a year in sales taxes on goods sold by mail. Retail merchants that make sales from a fixed place of business are put at a competitive disadvantage with the mail-order merchants that facilitate their customers' avoidance of sales tax.    What Rep. Dorgan's (D., N.D.) bill and a similar bill sponsored by Rep. Brooks (D., Texas) would do is put mail-order vendors on an equal competitive footing with &quot;main street&quot; vendors. It would see that more than $2 billion in evaded taxes would be collected by the states. It would increase the customers' respect for the tax-administration process.    Your readers should know that there is substantial doubt that the Supreme Court, if faced with the issues presented in 1967, would come to a similar conclusion in 1987, when a substantially greater percentage of national retail sales are being made by mail. It is estimated that by the year 2000 more than 25% of the nation's retail sales will be made by mail, TV shopping or other nontraditional &quot;stores.&quot;    The current bills would impose the requirement only on mail-order vendors with substantial interstate sales, which can better bear the costs of such compliance. If these bills are not passed, and the states are successful in overturning the 1967 Supreme Court decision, then all merchants would be required to collect sales tax on interstate sales, no matter how small the volume of such transactions.    In short, the legislation pending in Congress provides for a reasonable compromise of the interests of retail merchants, mail-order houses, their customers and the state revenue agencies. Your editorial resists such a reasonable compromise and raises the specter of the states' winning a victory in court that will be more burdensome on all the parties involved.    John R. Baldwin   Director, Division of Taxation    New Jersey Department of Treasury   President, National Association of Tax Administrators    Trenton, N.J.   ---   If enacted, the Dorgan bill would remove a modest but useful source of market discipline from state tax systems. It would favor those states with the highest sales taxes over others and would be particularly unfair to states having no sales tax. Perhaps it would coerce states into enacting or raising sales taxes to avoid relative disadvantage to their producers.    Further, it would impose a dead-weight cost on the economy by forcing national mail retailers to comply with the myriad, detailed differences among state and local sales taxes and by increasing the extent to which interstate sales are twice taxed -- at the point of production and the point of sale.    Finally, the bill would perversely benefit the wealthiest states relative to the poorest, an end that Congress ought not pursue. This is so because wealthier states consume more per capita, and the added taxes would be imposed on consumption.    Richard B.
