Most of these attacks, some of whichresulted in deaths of tourists, have been attributed to heavilyarmed wildlife poachers,'' the advisory said.   ``When visiting game parks, Americans are encouraged to travelin groups with a guide from a reputable safari firm or a gameranger.''   Marie Magdefrau Ferraro, 50, of Bethany, Conn., was shot todeath Thursday when two bandits armed with assault rifles emergedfrom nearby bushes and began firing at a van carrying a ConnecticutAudubon Society wildlife tour group.   It was originally suspected that the attackers were ivorypoachers. The Kenyan government has imposed a severe crackdown onpoachers who kill elephants for their ivory tusks.   But tour leader Milan Bull, who returned with the group Sunday,told The Hartford Courant that he believes the attackers weredeserters from the Somalian army.   The ambush was the latest in a series of attacks againsttourists in Kenya.   In April, three Germans were wounded in an ambush near where theConnecticut group was attacked. Four weeks ago, two French touristswere shot to death by poachers in Meru National Park. And last weektwo Americans were beaten up while on horseback safari.   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., had urged the StateDepartment to impose a travel advisory last week following theattack.   ``Using high-powered weapons, and with disregard for anyauthority, these criminals are roaming the countryside and preyingon innocent victims,'' the senator said.   Meanwhile, Ms. Ferraro's body is expected to be returned to theUnited States sometime this week, State Department officials said.   ``Our consul there has been working all weekend on it,'' saidone department official, who asked not to be identified. ``Thesethings take time and require a lot of paper (work) and arecomplicated. But there is no delay that I'm aware of.''</TEXT></DOC>
