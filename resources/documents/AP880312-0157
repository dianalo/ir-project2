(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 1,100 anti-nuclear protesters,including actress Teri Garr, actor Robert Blake, disc jockey CaseyKasem and activist Daniel Ellsberg were arrested Saturday at thenation's nuclear testing grounds.   Nye County authorities estimated the crowd of protesters at3,000, well below the 5,000 to 10,000 organizers predicted wouldcome to the remote site 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.   Saturday's demonstration, dubbed ``Reclaim The Test Site,'' waspart of a 10-day protest at the site through March 20. By lateafternoon the number of arrests had reached 1,136 and continued togrow, said Department of Energy spokesman Chris West.   Protesters climbed barbed wire fences surrounding the1,350-square-mile site, began walking across the desolate desertand were arrested by waiting authorities. Some 300 officers fromthe Nevada Highway Patrol, Nye County Sheriff's Office andDepartment of Energy security were on hand.   Miss Garr, Blake, Ellsberg and Kasem were arrested when theystepped across a cattle guard on the road leading to the mainentrance of the desert site.   The crowd cheered as each group of protesters stepped across theguard.   Miss Garr was asked if she thought joining the protest wouldhurt her movie career. ``I hope not,'' she said. ``I don't thinkyou have to be a fanatic to think nuclear weapons are going toannihilate the Earth.''   Those arrested were placed in two large enclosures, then busedto Tonopah and released, West said. All were cited for misdemeanortrespass. Authorities no longer prosecute misdemeanor arrests fortrespassing.   Authorities took extra precautions for the rally, building an8-foot chain-link enclosure topped with barbed wire to holddetainees.   Americans for Nuclear Testing held a counterdemonstrationSaturday, but organizer Peggy Konold said she expected her group tobe far outnumbered by the anti-nuclear protesters.   Protests at the site have been common in recent years. JesseCocks, an organizer with the American Peace Test, said herorganization counted 2,547 trespassing arrests in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
