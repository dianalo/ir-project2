A simulatingmethod for the optimum design of solar power generating system usingthe energy cost and coefficient of effective utilization of solar energyas the rating factor was developed. The method was applied to a residentialsolar power generating system in Tokyo showing the typical daily electricload pattern. The result indicates that the system with a peak cut factorof 10%, capacity of solar cell array of 3.2 kW and capacity of batteryof 72 kW is optimum. The coefficient of effective utilization of solarenergy and the system efficiency are 34.8 and 5.4%, respectively. Thereason why the coefficient of effective utilization of solar energy islow is that the amount of self-discharge of battery is large and thebattery is not effectively charged with the power generated by the solarcell array.
