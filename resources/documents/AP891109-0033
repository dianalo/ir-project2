The international human rights group said in a report that theSandinista government has imprisoned some soldiers for unlawfulkillings of civilians; pledged to investigate other such killings;improved legal protection for detainees; and freed more than 2,000political prisoners since 1986.   It also said, however, that since an April 1988 cease-fire therehas been no sign of a decline in non-combat killings and``disappearances'' of civilians blamed on security forces.   President Daniel Ortega suspended the 19-month-old truce lastweek, but government and Contra delegations were to begin meetingtoday in New York for the first direct peace talks since June 1988on ending the 8-year-old conflict.   The Contras are supposed to disband and leave their Hondurancamps voluntarily by early December under an Aug. 7 agreementsigned by Nicaragua and four other Central American governments.The rebels were not a party to the agreement, and so far most haveshown no inclination to lay down their weapons and return home.   Amnesty said the fate or whereabouts of scores of civilians whodisappeared after being arrested still have not been clarified.   Army units allegedly have killed dozens of unarmed civilians inprovinces bordering Honduras and Costa Rica and in Indian-dominatedregions on the Atlantic coast where fighting against the Contrasonce was intense, the report said.   In many cases, the victims allegedly were singled out ``inpunishment or reprisal for no other reason that their suspectedsympathy or support for the insurgent forces,'' it said.   Witnesses also have alleged that unarmed peasants have been shotto death while fleeing army patrols seeking to enforce militaryconscription, it said.   ``It appears that, following the withdrawal of Contra forces,some military units ... are resorting to killings during operationsto identify or neutralize networks of suspected Contra supportersand sympathizers,'' the report said.   ``Punitive action by the government, while indicating that itdoes not condone such abuses, has so far been insufficient to haltthem,'' it added.   It said the precise circumstances of the killings are oftendifficult or impossible to establish because there are noindependent witnesses.   The authorities contend that in some cases soldiers acted inself-defense because victims were suspected of being armed, hostileor dangerous. Military investigations have suggested other killingswere criminal acts involving ``personal quarrels, or the recklessfiring of weapons by drunken soldiers.''   Amnesty said reports persist of forced recruitment, torture andexecutions of civilians by the U.S.-backed rebels, but said suchabuses have dropped significantly in the past year.   ``Preventive measures reportedly adopted by these forces toimprove the conduct of their troops appear to have had littleeffect,'' the report said, but the number of reported abuses ``hasdeclined significantly since the winding down of military activityin 1988 and 1989.''   The report documents 56 cases of unlawful executions byNicaraguan troops between 1987 and 1989.   In three separate cases in which 10 civilians were killed, thegovernment sentenced 17 military and police personnel to prisonterms ranging from six years to the maximum 30 years, the reportsaid.   In other cases, investigations either have been suspended or areincomplete, it said.   It described how the mutilated bodies of five Catholic laypreachers were found a day after they were allegedly abducted bytroops searching for suspected Contras in the village of Apantilloon March 21, 1988. A military commission cleared army troops innearby Matiguas of involvement, but villagers insisted the troopswere responsible.   Amnesty said it based its findings on three visits to Nicaragua,and its sources included relatives of those killed, disappeared orimprisoned.   Nicaragua lifted a state of emergency in January 1988, restoringmany civil and political rights that had been suspended for nearlysix years, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
