 By extrapolation, with enoughcomputing power and fancy goggles, headphones, and a full-bodysensor suit, people can enter into a virtual reality that is allencompassing.andP;  Believable virtual reality is still a fantasybecause it requires enormous amounts of computing power and verysophisticated graphics capabilities.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Virtual RealityCyberneticsCost Benefit AnalysisFeasibility.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Every once in a while, the popular media picks up on a rumor of some strangenew technology and unleashes their fantasies on an unsuspecting public.andP;  Thisyear the hot topic is cyberspace, the realm of virtual reality.andM;The concept of virtual reality started with waldos, which are remote robotarms, like those used on the space shuttle.andP;  Sensor connections or mechanicalcontrols allow the waldo to mimic the arm and hand movements of the operatorand act like an enhanced body part.andM;The logical extension of the waldo concept is the full-body waldo.andP;  With theproper sensor gear, high-resolution graphic goggles and some headphones, youcould enhance all kinds of body parts.andM;Of course, there are always those who go overboard on otherwise goodconcepts.andP;  These guys want virtual reality: A full-nelson mind waldo thatlets you extend as much of yourself as you can afford right into Never-NeverLand (read: cyberspace).andM;Using fancy goggles, headphones and a full-body sensor suit, you can launchyourself into an alternate world, in which you can interact with artificialobjects.andP;  And when there is enough computing power available in all Creation,you can hang out with artificial beings and even other cyberspace travellers.andM;By pointing your finger, you'll be able to fly around like Peter Pan or waltzaround your office pretending you're the Queen of France.andP;  Hell, why not gofor broke.andP;  Pretend you're Richard Simmons!andM;Fortunately, most of this stuff is still a fantasy, because it takes a lot ofcomputing horsepower to work up a decent virtual reality.andP;  Nowadays, you'relucky if you can conjure up a room with some furniture in it, let alone ausable Never-Never Land.andM;At least we're safe for a while.andP;  Pocket supercomputers are probably still afew years down the road, so the cybernauts will have to stay safely tuckedaway in government and university research labs.andP;  We need some time to thinkabout this one.andM;I can deal with waldos.andP;  I can even see putting on an electronic monkey suitand pretending I'm Robbie the Robot, but I don't think I want to be hangingaround with other folks in cyberspace.andP;  To me, that sounds like a bad acidtrip.andM;First of all, you'll need one hellacious computer.andP;  If you want toeffectively chill with your electronic brothers, you have to project a goodimage, and that requires horsepower and graphics resolution.andP;  Then you need ahairy network, if you want to travel in style.andP;  And don't forget the monkeysuit.andP;  Those are expensive too.andP;  You can practically race an Indy car for aseason for what it costs to become a cybernaut these days.andM;Even if you can cover the expense, how do you expect to get it working?andO;Network problems are bad enough, but can you imagine what would happen ifyour reality went down?andP;  Talk about an existential crisis!andP;  One bad packetcould take off the top of your virtual head!andM;OPEN REALITY INTERCONNECTandM;That means we'll need standards!andP;  Do you think that ISO is going to have avirtual reality standard?andP;  The philosphers would' have a field day trying tofigure out how many layers the Open Reality Interconnect model ought to have.andO;I don't know about you, but I don't want foreigners dictating my reality,virtual or otherwise.andM;Of course, we could always go proprietary.andP;  It would be easier to get thealternate universe up and running that way, but I don't think I'd want tospend too much time in IBM's Virtual Reality Architecture.andP;  They'd probablymake everybody wear a suit.andM;Or maybe the Internet folks can come up with a virtual reality standard.andP;  Themilitary will probably want to pervert the technology by developingmech-warrior waldos, so the universities can just follow the cash trail.andM;The problem with this approach is that it will probably attract the&quot;differently-socialized&quot; (that's the politically correct term for Coke-andTwinkie-fueled network weenies), who already spend too much time hanging outon the current Internet.andP;  This will be a problem.andP;  If you've ever seen theUSEnet news feeds, or heard about the Cornell worm, you know what I mean.andO;It's anarchy out there.andM;This brings up the issue of security.andP;  Viruses, worms and maladjusted yahoostake on a whole new meaning in virtual reality.andP;  Without proper security,everybody would be so paranoid and distrustful, you'd think you were in NewYork.andP;  That's too real for me.andM;No, I think we should just forget this virtual reality stuff and stick withthe here-and-now.andP;  It sounds too weird and complicated to me.andP;  It'ss cost toomuch, and peoople won't know how to deal with it.andM;Hey, wait a second.andP;  If it's that much of a problem, we'll need consultants.andO;Maybe thousands of consultants.andP;  Hmmm.andP;  .  .  Maybe it's not such a bad ideaafter all.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
