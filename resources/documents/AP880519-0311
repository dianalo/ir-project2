The Wall Street Journal said that documents it obtained andinterviews conducted with business associates show Bilzerian mayhave engaged in such crimes as insider trading, tax fraud, filingfalse documents with the SEC and ``parking'' stock in accounts thatconceal its ownership.   The investigations stem from the Ivan Boesky insider tradingscandal. The Journal also said new details of possible securiteslaw violations surfaced in the SEC lawsuit filed last week againstOhio developer Edward DeBartolo, Sr.   Bilzerian, an eccentric high school dropout who amassed afortune through real estate, stock market speculation and takeoverraids, used a number of possibly illegal tactics to ``force largecorporations into unwanted takeovers or liquidations that gainedhim hundreds of millions of dollars,'' the Journal said.   A spokesman at Singer headquarters said Bilzerian had no commenton the Journal report.   In one case early on in his takeover career, Bilzerian secretlypurchased and parked 58,000 shares of H.H. Robertson Co., aPittsburgh construction company he said he would acquire for $250million, the Journal said.   But Bilzerian never followed through with a formal bid and didnot file any documents detailing his offer with the SEC, asrequired by law, the paper said. In the process, the Journal said,Bilzerian alienated Canada's wealthy Belzberg family, which owned17 percent of Robertson.   Bilzerian also reneged on an agreement to buy back the Robertsonshares he parked at Jefferies andamp; Co., leaving the Los Angelessecurities firm with a $250,000 loss, the paper said.   Later, however, Bilzerian partly reimbursed Jefferies, and thensent the firm two phony invoices for $75,000 each when he learedthe firm had recouped a good portion of the loss on its own, theJournal said.   In his next deal, the paper said, the Florida raider secretlyenlisted the aid of the DeBartolo in his bid for Cluett, Peabody andamp;Co. SEC documents do not reveal any links between the two, but theJournal said DeBartolo bought large blocks of Cluett stock forhimself and arranged for others to buy more, sometimes aftertalking with Bilzerian.   The Journal said documents indicate DeBartolo lent Bilzerianmillions of dollars to purchase Cluett shares. Bilzerian and hisinvestor group walked away with $82 million after WestPoint-Pepperell Inc. surfaced as a ``white knight'' and boughtCluett.   The paper also said Bilzerian had an arrangement with Jefferiesthat the firm would buy stock in Hammermill Paper Co., his nexttarget, and hold it for him to buy at a later date. BetweenJefferies and his own purchases, Bilzerian's stake totaled morethan 5 percent, though he did not report it to the SEC as requiredby law, the Journal said.   An hour before Bilzerian launched a $900 million bid forHammermill, he purchased an additional 1.7 million shares, thepaper said.   The Journal noted that Bilzerian did not report he was againworking with DeBartolo, who was amassing his own block ofHammermill shares.   Bilzerian and his group made $54 million when Hammermill wasrescued by International Paper Co.   The paper said Bilzerian parked at least 800,000 shares of Armcowith Jefferies in late 1986. To realize a $500,000 profit when thestock rose in price, he sent Jefferies an invoice for consultingservices payable on Jan. 2, 1987, in an attempt to defer the gainfor tax purposes, the paper said.   The Journal noted that Bilzerian and Jefferies severed allrelations shortly after Nov. 12, 1986, when the government'sinvestigation into insider trading violations swung into high gear.   In March 1987, Boyd Jefferies, chairman of the investment firm,agreed to settle SEC charges, pleaded guilty to two felonies andagreed to cooperate. The SEC then began investigating thetransactions involving Cluett, Hammermill and other companies thatBilzerian had a hand in, the Journal said.   Bilzerian acquired Singer in a $1.06 billion hostile bid on theheels of the stock market crash, putting him at the helm of one ofthe nation's oldest corporations.</TEXT></DOC>
