One question: Does the Machinists' right to picket railroads,including Amtrak and Metro-North, mean the railroads' own employeeshave a right to observe those picket lines, even if their bossesorder them to work?   The other: What's the difference between trains and planes?Specifically, does the fact that this case involves two industriesdistinguish it from a 1987 Supreme Court decision involving tworailroads?   The man on the spot is U.S. District Court Judge Robert P.Patterson Jr. He was elevated to the bench Dec. 20.   ``He's ruling in an arcane area of labor law, he's under rea timepressure, and he's going to have to make new law,'' says amanagement labor lawyer speaking on the condition of anonymity.``This case is out at the edge of where the law is.''   ``This is arcane stuff even for labor lawyers and veteranjudges,'' said another lawyer who spoke on the same terms. ``Thisjudge has got some learning to do.''   In an apparent attempt to force federal intervention, theMachinists last week announced plans to picket railroad stations aspart of their strike against Eastern.   But on Sunday, Patterson _ who was spending the weekend upstateat his country home, Fair Oaks Farm _ issued an order that barredrailroad union members from striking until 3 p.m. Wednesday, and seta hearing an hour earlier. On Tuesday, he extended his order untilmidnight Friday.   The key decision to which Patterson will be referring isBurlington Northern Railroad vs. Maintenance of Way Employees, inwhich the Supreme Court ruled that the Railway Labor Act of 1926,which covers railroads and airlines, does not prohibit secondarystrikes. Such strikes are prohibited in most industries by theTaft-Hartley Act.   The railroads concede the Machinists' right to picket railstations but argue that the railroads have the right to order theiremployees to cross those picket lines.   The railroads' contracts with their unions don't contain explicitno-strike clauses, which would override the unions' right to honor asecondary strike. But Robert Bergen, a lawyer for Metro-North, sayshis commuter railroad's labor contracts contain ``an implicitno-strike pledge'' because they stipulate that all disputes besubject to arbitration.   Jay Roth of Burbank, Calif., a co-chairman of the American BarAssociation's Railway and Airline Law Committee, disputed that. Hesaid that unless a labor contract specifically bars a secondarystrike, it is a ``protected act'' under federal law. ``You eitherhave the right or you don't,'' said Roth, who represents unions.``I'm at a loss to explain the judge's decision'' to grant therestraining order.   The importance of the second question _ Are airlines andrailroads separate industries? _ stems from the fact that years ago,the fledgling airline unions got themselves covered by the RailwayLabor Act. It subjects railroad workers to a separate body of laborlaw from other workers.   In the Burlington Northern case, the court held that the RailwayAct, by not mentioning secondary strikes or boycotts, implicitlypermitted them. But that case involved several freight lines. Doesthe fact that this one involves an airline and several railroadssignificantly distinguish it?   The cross-industry issue may be important for another reason.With some exceptions, including those outlined in the Taft-HartleyAct, federal courts lack jurisdiction to issue injunctions in labordisputes. But the law that established that principle, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, established an exception of its own: cross-industrysecondary strikes.   That legislation reflected Congress's conviction that strikesshould be economic battles, not political ones, and thus fought onlyby unions and companies in the same industry. Whether this appliesto Eastern, Amtrak, Metro-North and company is for Patterson to say.</TEXT></DOC>
