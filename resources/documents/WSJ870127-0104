This is significant because Secretary Weinberger has previously been reluctant to embrace the near-term deployment of a limited SDI system. He feared that a limited system would protect only military targets, in effect reinforcing rather than ending the strategic doctrine of mutual assured destruction. MAD, of course, is the notion that safety in a nuclear world lies in each side being able to absorb a first strike and then destroy the other side's population centers. Mr. Weinberger, President Reagan and other SDI proponents want to defend civilians, not threaten them.    A state-of-the-art system, though, can defend both military and civilian targets. Last week, Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, head of the SDI program, reiterated that the secretary isn't talking about a &quot;point defense&quot; to protect only missile silos. If the system can destroy enemy missiles shortly after liftoff, he said, &quot;we will protect both people and important military installations.&quot; And Mr. Weinberger said that while the first-phase deployment wouldn't stop all nuclear warheads, it could nonetheless &quot;seriously erode&quot; an attack on U.S. military targets and also reduce the Kremlin's &quot;level of confidence&quot; in its ability to &quot;inflict damage on the Free World.&quot;    The new optimism about deploying an SDI system in the next five to 10 years follows the spectacular success of a Sept. 5 experiment. The U.S. launched a satellite to simulate a Soviet rocket carrying multiple warheads. Then an SDI satellite was launched to track and actively maneuver to destroy the target. The SDI vehicle -- known as a kinetic-energy weapon because it destroys an enemy target by the sheer force of impact -- acheived a head-on collision at a closing rate of 6,500 miles per hour, covering the last mile before impact in just over half a second. Despite such speed, the SDI weapon hit the target within six to 12 inches of the desired accuracy.    The sensors on the SDI vehicle worked &quot;beyond the point we had dared hope,&quot; said Lt. Col. Michael Rendine, manager of the project. &quot;Since they worked so much better than expected, I personally believe our job is going to be much easier&quot; to develop accurate sensors for high-speed kinetic-kill vehicles.    President Reagan was apprised of the success of this experiment and other recent SDI advances at a Dec. 17 White House briefing by Messrs. Weinberger and Abrahamson. He was also told about the prospects for a near-term deployment of the first phase of SDI and was said to have reacted favorably.    These rapid technological achievements are beginning to pose serious political and budgetary questions for SDI proponents and opponents alike. President Reagan, for instance, is expected to consult with Secretary of State George Shultz and arms-control adviser Paul Nitze about the arms-control implications of SDI deployment, presumably limited by the 1972 ABM treaty. Congress too will face a new challenge on SDI. It is due to get a Pentagon report on near-term deployment prospects by March 15. Meanwhile, it must consider the Defense Department's request to restore $500 million of the $1.6 billion cut out of SDI funding for the current fiscal year.    The success of the SDI research and development makes it harder for SDI critics to merely call the program a waste of money. The Randamp;D investment so far is proving wrong those who say it won't work. The big question now is not technological but whether U.S. policy makers are ready to abandon the MAD theory, which the &quot;arms-control community&quot; has somehow turned into a matter of high theology. Yet aside from the inherent immorality of threatening masses of civilians, MAD is not a sensible military option. Incredible threats do not enhance our national security.    President Reagan's initial Star Wars speech nearly four years ago threw down the glove over MAD. The research is starting to disprove the technical critics, and early deployment of the first building-block now looks feasible. The opponents will have to come out from behind their smoke screens, and try to convince us that SDI is wrong precisely because it would defend women and children. </TEXT></DOC>
