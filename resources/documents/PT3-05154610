The      free end of the stud is adequately shaped to fit the auxiliary tool used      to place it in the model. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to positioning studs for master models for      dental prostheses and the like. </PAR><PAR>  Conventionally, positioning studs which are used are simple smooth shanks.      The shanks are adapted and placed in holes, which correspond to the model,      by using an adhesive or glue. This requires that the adhesive be very      fast-drying to ensure that the adhesive secures completely and quickly and      that great care be taken when placing the positioning studs in the holes      so that they do not slant. This implies a combination of special care,      speed and accuracy, which are difficult to combine. Therefore, there will      always be disadvantages in using smooth shanks, which are normally      utilized. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is directed to an easy-to-place positioning stud      which is accurate and overcomes the difficulties in using conventional      positioning studs. The stud has a threaded area, limited from the rest of      the stud by a small boss. The stud is intended to be inserted mechanically      into a hole previously made in the model and does not need any type of      glue. The stud is perfectly secured and leaves the rest of the stud, which      is a smooth shank, to remain in its proper place. The end of the shank is      shaped like a tongue or groove to assist with the screwing of the shank by      a respectively auxiliary tool, which is applied to the tongue or groove. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The positioning stud for master models of the present invention will be      described in detail, with reference to the attached drawing which shows a      preferred form of embodiment of the invention. The preferred form is      simply by way of example and is not limiting, but is subject to any      variations in detail which do not involve a fundamental alteration of its      essential features. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an elevational plan view of a stud with a groove at the free end      of the stud. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an elevational plan view of between projected areas taken from      the left or right of FIG. 1. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 1 and 2 show a positioning stud for master models that comprises a      cylindrical body with a suitable diameter. About one third of the length      of the body 1 is provided with a threaded area 2, which is specifically      designed for each particular application. A boss 3 separates the threaded      area 2 from the smooth area 1. The boss has a slightly larger diameter      than the stud so that it forms a stop when inserted. The end of the smooth      area 1 forms a diametrical groove 4 (FIG. 1) 5 (FIG. 2) or any other      shape, such as a star, for example, where the suitable auxiliary screwing      tool fits. </PAR><PAR>  The stud made in this way is placed in the base of a plaster positive, in      which holes have previously been made. The holes have a suitable diameter      for enabling the threaded area 2 to be inserted in them by means of the      screw pitch of the threaded area. In this manner, the plaster positive is      perfectly secured to the stud by a screw threaded system without the      presence of any type of glue whatsoever. </PAR><PAR>  After the studs 1 have been placed in the plaster positive, the respective      parts corresponding to the model concerned in each case are fitted on the      smooth area 1. Advantages of the invention include eliminating the need      for glues, ensuring a perfectly secure fit by screwing, and enabling the      possibility of removing the studs by unscrewing when required for use      elsewhere. Conventional studs at present cannot be re-used, because they      are secured by glues and their point of application cannot be corrected      once in place. </PAR><PAR>  The shape, materials and dimensions may be varied and accessories added      provided this does not alter, change or modify the essential nature of the      present invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1. A combination useful for positioning in master models, comprising: </PAR><PA1>  a positioning stud having a body with a smooth portion and a threaded      portion, said threaded portion being threaded with a screw pitch, the      smooth portion having a free end distal from the threaded portion; </PA1><PA1>  a plaster positive into which is inserted said threaded portion, said      plaster positive threadably engaging said threaded portion to enable      screwing and unscrewing of the stud in the plaster positive; </PA1><PA1>  stop means for limiting insertion of said positioning stud into said      plaster positive, said stop means including a boss which has a diameter      that is larger than that of said threaded portion, said boss being located      between said threaded and smooth portions; and </PA1><PA1>  engaging means adapted for cooperative engagement by a tool for screwing      the positioning stud into the plaster positive, said engaging means being      at the free end of the smooth portion. </PA1><NUM>  2. </NUM><PAR>  2.
