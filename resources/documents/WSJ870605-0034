The charges were contained in court papers unsealed yesterday in U.S. District Court. Lawyers for Robert M. Freeman and Timothy L. Tabor, two of three Wall Street arbitragers who were indicted in the insider-trading case, last Friday filed a motion accusing U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani of violating grand jury secrecy rules in making improper statements about the case. The motion had been sealed.    The government and attorneys for the two men agreed yesterday to public proceedings at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram. The hearing was requested by Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of the Journal. Attorneys for the Journal had argued that the proceedings should be public.    In the motion unsealed yesterday, Paul J. Curran, Mr. Freeman's attorney, said the two men will ask the court to order an investigation &quot;into the sources of the leaks that formed the basis&quot; for a May 22 Journal story.    That story disclosed the names of 11 takeover-related stocks that figure in the government's continuing investigation of alleged insider trading by the three men, including Richard B. Wigton. The story, which revealed other details of the government's probe, quoted unnamed people familiar with the government's investigation.    The motion said, &quot;From the face of the disclosures, it is apparent that no single source outside the government could possibly know all that was told to The Wall Street Journal.&quot;    A spokesman for Mr. Giuliani said there is &quot;simply no merit&quot; to the defense lawyers' claims. A spokesman for the Journal said, &quot;As a matter of principle, we don't comment on confidential sources for articles.&quot;    Mr. Curran's motion charged that Mr. Giuliani violated grand jury secrecy rules in making improper public statements about the case to various publications, primarily this newspaper, and at news conferences.    The defense attorneys have insisted that government prosecutors violated secrecy requirements by characterizing the indictment of the three men as &quot;merely the tip of an iceberg,&quot; as well as making other statements.    Judge Kram scheduled a hearing today on the allegations by the lawyers for Messrs. Freeman and Tabor.    Mr. Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., and Messrs. Tabor and Wigton, both former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. arbitragers, had been charged with securities, mail and wire fraud. The charges against them were dropped May 19, but the government has said it plans to seek a new, expanded indictment.    Andrew M. Lawler, the lawyer for Mr. Tabor, joined in Mr. Curran's motion. Mr. Wigton's attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, previously said he wasn't joining in Mr. Curran's motion but supported it in spirit.    Separately, Dow Jones moved yesterday to have the plea agreements of three figures in the Wall Street scandal unsealed. The three figures are takeover speculator Ivan Boesky, former Kidder investment banker Martin Siegel and Boyd Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc.    In those motions, Dow Jones attorneys said the agreements were &quot;sealed from public view without any finding of any kind to justify such secrecy.&quot; The attorneys argued that &quot;public evaluation of those agreements is essential to the ability of the public to participate in the system of criminal justice.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
