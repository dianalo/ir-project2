Here incomplete relaxation is regarded as a process producinga metastable, long-lived state which is stabilized by the approximateconservation of some set of global quantities in addition to the totalenergy and the number of particles. The final state corresponds to amaximum of the classical (Boltzmann) entropy provided that the properphase space partition and set of constraints are chosen. Here two differentways of implementing these ideas are explored.</TEXT></DOC>
