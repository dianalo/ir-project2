Normal antitrust rules would be suspendedto allow negotiations between health-care providers and consumers to developprices and payment rates needed to meet the targets.;    (check) All employerswould be required to provide health insurance for their employees or to pay aspecial payroll tax to help pay for a new public health-care plan for peoplewithout health insurance.;    (check) The government would offer tax breaksand other incentives to make it easier for small businesses and self-employedpeople to buy health insurance.;    Compliance with the spending targets wouldbe voluntary at first. But if spending for the nation as a whole or for &quot;anysector of the health-care industry&quot; significantly exceeded the goals in anyyear, the board would recommend additional steps to Congress and the presidentto keep spending in line with the goals.;    The United States spends morethan $660 billion a year on health care, and the amount has doubled in thelast eight years.;    Senate Democrats said they had not yet determined thecost of their proposal. The plan has little chance of being passed in itscurrent form, but it is likely to be the main vehicle for congressional actionin the next two years as consumers, doctors, hospitals and insurers expressgrowing dissatisfaction with the current health-care system.;    The SenateDemocrats' insurance proposal would build on the current mix of public andprivate health programs. Employers that provide coverage for their employeeswould not have to pay the special payroll tax that would finance the publichealth-care plan for the uninsured.;    The amount of the payroll tax has notbeen decided.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910525  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  483  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday May 25, 199100146031,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
