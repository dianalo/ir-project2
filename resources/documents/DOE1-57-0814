Adsorptionin the presence of acids increased in the following series: without acidandgt; hydrochloric andgt; sulfuric andgt; phosphoric, and is higher than in the presenceof salts. The surface concentration of lauryl sulfate adsorbed from asuspension without electrolyte is about 0.9 {mu}mol/m{sup 2}. The surfacecoverage of hydroxide by lauryl sulfate is about 1/5 of a monolayer,but it decreases in the presence of electrolyte. The law of mass actionwas applied to characterize the effect of solution composition on theadsorption of lauryl sulfate on cobalt(II) hydroxide.</TEXT></DOC>
