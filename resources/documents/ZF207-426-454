Moley, whoran the advance operation for the Bush-Quayle presidential campaign, has beenappointed assistant secretary for management and budget.andP;  Moley will beresponsible for the department's $400 billion budget, largest in the federalgovernment.&quot;andM;Moley's appointment is not atypical.andP;  Junior political operatives with skimpymanagerial backgrounds are being slotted into key administrative poststhroughout the government by Bush's White House personnel office.andP;  Thepresident has been chided for moving slowly in filling government posts, butjudging from the quality of his selections, we would be better off if he tookanother three years or so.andM;Like so many of Bush's public utterances, his vows to strengthen leadershipin the public service do not translate into action.andM;It is unfortunate the Volcker Commission report was released at the time ofthe pay raise fiasco and gained press attention mostly because it supportedthe raise.andM;The commission, more properly called the National Commission on the PublicService, was concerned with more fundamental issues of governance, remindingus that &quot;one need not search far to see grounds for concern.andP;  Cripplednuclear weapons plants, defense procurement scandals, leaking hazardous wastedumps, near-misses in air traffic control and the costly collapse of so manysavings and loans [reflect] government's inability to recruit and retain atalented work force.&quot;andM;The Volcker Commission, of which Richardson was a member, reported that iftrends continue, &quot;America will soon be left with a government of themediocre, locked into careers of last resort or waiting for a chance to moveon to other jobs.&quot;andM;Thanks a lot, George.andP;  As your advance men come in the front door, thededicated senior executives leave by the servants' entrance.andP;  Civil servantsentrance, that is.andM;The recent furor over procurement &quot;integrity&quot; would have little meaning iftalented civil servants were not pursuing lucrative second careers in thecontractor community.andP;  If they capped out their careers as publicadministrators, they would have no worry about conflicts of interest.andM;It's probably too late for the Bush administration to heed thewell-considered reflections of the Volcker Commission, but I include one ofthem, if only for the benefit of the next transition team:andM;&quot;The growth in recent years in the number of presidential appointees, whetherthose subject to Senate confirmation, non-career senior executives orpersonal and confidential assistants, should be curtailed.andP;  The commission isconfident a substantial cut is possible, and believes a cut from the current3,000 to no more than 2,000 is a reasonable target.&quot;andM;When James Watt was Reagan's Interior secretary, he noted the buffalo symbolon the department's logo was facing left instead of right.andP;  Watt had specialpins designed for his political minions with the bison facing right.andP;  Orderswent out that those wearing the new pin should communicate only with eachother and should avoid mixing with career civil servants.andM;Watt and his shaggy beast are gone, but not the practice of appointing callowpolitical operatives to supervise career civil servants.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
