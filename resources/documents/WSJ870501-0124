Two newsletters -- the Davis/Zweig Bond Fund Timer and the Muni Bond Fund Report -- are applying a timing strategy to fixed-income markets. While the circulations of the newsletters are tiny, the practice has caused some bond fund managers to raise their eyebrows at the potential of more &quot;hot&quot; money coursing through already volatile markets.    Most timers try to call tops and bottoms in the stock market, switching in and out of stock funds and money market funds based on signals from their advisers. While few are consistently on the mark, they can cause asset swings that are troublesome to portfolio managers, particularly if a fund must sell securities into a down market to meet redemptions.    &quot;They're trying to do magic. I question anybody's ability to predict interest rates,&quot; says James Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management, a Palo Alto, Calif., fund group that manages $3.35 billion in fixed-income funds. Timing the bond market is a relatively new wrinkle in mutual-fund circles, and many traditional stock timing newsletters have begun including bond assessments as well.    Mr. Benham and others believe timers &quot;would aggravate&quot; moves like telephone trading and the recent exodus from municipal bond funds as the funds' net asset values fell. Particularly likely targets are no-load groups that don't charge for the moves and encourage telephone trading. The newsletter editors maintain they're providing a service for their subscribers.    The Davis/Zweig letter, run by investment adviser Martin Zweig and technical analyst Ned Davis, uses four technical indexes to sketch a model portfolio. Unlike classic timers who take an all-or-nothing approach, the Davis/Zweig letter moves only in 25% increments. Its creators say that strategy is risk-related while true timers say it's wishy-washy. As recently as April 8 -- after bond funds started getting hurt by rising interest rates -- the Davis/Zweig model was fence-sitting with a 50-50 call, advising investors to keep half their assets in bond funds and half in money funds.    Which bond funds to use is another matter altogether. Although the letter sketches its model portfolio (on March 25 it listed a specific muni fund, Ginnie Mae fund and high-grade corporate bond fund in addition to a money market fund) it also runs general lists of no-load funds that investors must choose among.    Not surprisingly, the Davis/Zweig report has become more bearish, dropping to a 25% bond position around mid-April. Yesterday it called for a complete move out of bonds and into money market funds. Meanwhile, the bond market rallied sharply for the day.    Both timing newsletters are too new to have much of a track record with investors. Mr. Davis figures his partnership's model is down about 1% since start-up Feb. 17, compared with a drop of about 5% in the overall bond market.    The Muni Bond Report, which tracks only municipal issues, signaled a switch out of that market March 24. But subscribers had to telephone the service hotline that day to get the message. Otherwise, they had to wait for the April newsletter to reach their mailboxes.    Ralph Norton, editor of the Huntington Beach, Calif., Muni Bond newsletter, concedes that his timing wasn't perfect. Bond prices were already starting to slide as his hotline message went out. Still, he figures 60% to 80% of his subscribers switched and lost only a small amount off the recent market top.    Of course, many investors have been &quot;timing&quot; the municipal market on their own in recent weeks. They switched assets into shorter-term funds and money market accounts to avoid drops in the principal value of their bonds as rates rose. How many investors will pay for such advice and whether that advice will be any good are open questions.    In any case, the Davis/Zweig report has already cut its price. Mr. Davis said the firm floated two trial prices -- $79 a year and $49 a year -- and decided the lower price was more feasible.    ---   Money Fund Assets Drop   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 380 money market funds fell $523.5 million to $238.27 billion in the week ended Wednesday.    The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, noted that the drop followed a sharp increase last week.    &quot;Uncertainty regarding trends in prices of equities and long-term debt instruments may have prompted some investors to seek the safe haven of general purpose money funds,&quot; said Alfred P. Johnson, vice president and chief economist at the institute.    He said assets of other investors, particularly those in broker dealer money funds, declined primarily because income taxes were due. He added that institutional investors shifted funds to short-term securities in search of higher yields.    Assets of 198 general purpose funds rose $860.9 million to $67.26 billion. Assets of 89 broker-dealer funds fell $1.04 billion to $106.02 billion. Assets of 93 institutional funds fell $341.6 million to $64.98 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, fell to 5.51% from 5.52% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for funds rose to 5.48% from 5.46%, and the average maturity of funds remained at 43 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.2% on their &quot;money market savings accounts&quot; in the week ended Wednesday, unchanged from the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 5.99% for six-month savings certificates of deposit, up from 5.89% the previous week. Yields were 6.29% for one-year bank savings CDs, up from 6.17%. </TEXT></DOC>
