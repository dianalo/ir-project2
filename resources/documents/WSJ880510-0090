Earlier this year, the Reagan administration committed the U.S. to returning to the moon and rocketing off to Mars, but didn't say when or how much it would cost. Now, a Congressional Budget Office report circulating on Capitol Hill has put a price tag on the missions -- and made the journeys even less probable than before.    NASA would have to spend between $20 billion and $33 billion annually by the year 2000 to gear up for a Mars mission, the budget office estimates. And even then, the U.S. couldn't hope to land on the red planet until 2005. &quot;It is impossible to determine whether the (missions) would be commensurate with the increased cost and risk,&quot; the analysis says.    The Reagan administration didn't propose a specific plan for interplanetary travel, so the CBO, a bipartisan arm of Congress that analyzes program costs, looked at two earlier proposals for Mars missions.    One plan, formulated by a panel headed by former astronaut Sally Ride, suggests a 14-month round trip to Mars by 2005. A more ambitious plan, hatched by a group headed by former NASA Administrator Thomas Paine, features a return trip to the moon by 2005, and a manned expedition to Mars from the moon 10 years later.    The budget office didn't estimate the total cost of either plan, but rather estimated how much NASA as a whole would have to spend annually to gear up for manned space exploration.    For the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, NASA is spending about $9 billion; the agency is fighting, with little luck, for $11.5 billion for next fiscal year. Ms. Ride's Mars plan would require the agency to spend $33 billion in 2000, the CBO report says. That's 50% more than NASA spent in 1965, the peak year for Apollo moon-launch spending. (All the CBO's figures are in 1988 dollars.)    Even apart from Mars, NASA's budget would rise sharply, the CBO estimates, to $14.4 billion in 1993 and $16.4 billion in 2000 if the agency builds a manned space station and continues improving the space shuttle. That would require increases of about 10% annually, after inflation, through 1993.    Given budget constraints, such a steep funding increase is highly unlikely. So the congressional office proposes two alternatives for NASA to save money, neither allowing for manned exploration of the moon or Mars. NASA could stretch out its planned expenditures, the CBO suggests, so that it completes a manned space station in about 2005 -- about 10 years later than NASA wants. Alternatively, NASA could sharply cut manned space flights, including scrapping its plans for a permanently manned space station.    Either plan, the CBO concedes, &quot;would require the United States to relinquish the possibility of leadership in manned space flight at least for the immediate future.&quot; It would also cede to the Soviet Union leadership in long-duration space flight. Instead, the U.S. would have to content itself with trying to maintain its lead in space science and unmanned probes. </TEXT></DOC>
