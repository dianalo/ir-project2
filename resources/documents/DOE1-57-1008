<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-1008 </DOCNO><TEXT>The UV decomposition of chloromethyl formate and vinyl formate has beenstudied in low-temperature noble gas matrices at wavelengths between200 and 260 nm. Two distinct channels in cage photolysis were observed:(i) ClH{sub 2}COCHO {yields} ClH{sub 2}COH + CO; H{sub 2}CCHOCHO {yields}H{sub 2}CCHOH + CO. (ii) ClH{sub 2}COCHO {yields} H{sub 2}CO + HCl +CO; H{sub 2}CCHOCHO {yields} CH{sub 3}CHO + CO. There is a well-establishedwavelength dependence influencing the product ratios in these photochemicalprocesses. Decomposition due to irradiation at wavelengths near 250 nmprefers channel i, where the formic acid esters decompose to the correspondingalcoholic species, chloromethanol (a new compound), and vinyl alcohol.On the other hand, at shorter wavelengths, channel ii dominates. Neitherchloromethanol nor vinyl alcohol were observed to decompose at wavelengthsabove 200 nm. The photoprocesses of vinyl formate were also studied inNO-doped Ar matrices as well as in solid Xe in order to get informationconcerning the mechanisms of photochemical decomposition of formic acidesters. The assignment of the vibrational spectra is based on ab initocalculations performed at the Hartree-Fock 6-31G** level for chloromethanoland at the MP2/6-31G** level for vinyl alcohol. A detailed vibrationalanalysis is given for chloromethanol, chloromethanol-O-d, and vinyl alcohol.</TEXT></DOC>
