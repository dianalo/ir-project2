Rather we are asking the court to pull thisone thread,'' said Charles Fried, for the Bush administration.   Frank Susman, for those who challenged the Missouri law,disagreed, saying: ``... he (Fried) does not seek to unravel thewhole cloth of procreational rights but merely to pull a thread. Ithas always been my personal experience that when I pull a thread mysleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a thread he isafter. It is the full range of procreational rights and choicesthat constitute the fundamental right that has been recognized bythis court.''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><TEXT>   Susman said: ``I think the basic question ... whether this is ahuman life or whether human life begins at conception, is notsomething that is verifiable as a fact. .... Both sides would agreeas to when a heartbeat can first be detected. Both sides wouldagree as to when brain waves can first be detected. But when youtry to place the emotional labels on what you call that collectionof physiological facts, that is where people part company.''</TEXT></DOC>
