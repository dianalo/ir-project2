About 3,300 boat people refused lunch and dinner today atWhitehead Detention Center, joining another 2,000 who have refusedto eat since Thursday, a government spokesman said. The centerholds 5,900 refugees.   ``They chanted slogans in Vietnamese saying they would ratherdie than be sent back to Vietnam, and hung out English-languagebanners saying `Live in Liberty,''' the spokesman said on conditionof anonymity.   Hunger strikers are protesting a policy that treats them asillegal immigrants subject to repatration.   It was adopted a year ago by Southeast Asian governments thatsaid most refugees are seeking better living conditions. Thecountries say they will repatriate all except those who prove theyare fleeing political persecution.   The policy has not stemmed the tide of refugees, who risk theirlives in frail boats on rough seas traveled by marauding pirates.   Another 585 people sailed into Hong Kong waters today and weretowed to Tai A Chau, an outlying island without shelter that nowhas a population of 1,000 people docked in their boats. Agovernment statement said they will stay there because of thehunger strike at the detention center on the mainland.
