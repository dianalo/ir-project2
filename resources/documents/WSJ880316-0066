Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   The stock market muddled through another day with investors biding their time until the government's report on the January trade deficit is released tomorrow.    Blue-chip stocks retreated slightly while the broader market edged higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.66 to 2047.41 on New York Stock Exchange volume of just 133.2 million shares, barely above the 131.9 million traded Monday. But advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners, 789 to 718.    &quot;The psychology of the market is that you've got to be worried about something, and the most important thing you can worry about right now is the trade deficit,&quot; said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. About the only bright spot that he and other traders could find in the market was the slight boost at the end of the trading session as bargain hunters entered the market.    But James Wright, senior managing director of Banc One Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio, said it isn't the stock market that's worried about the trade numbers, but rather the bond market.    &quot;The stock market and the bond market are tightly coupled,&quot; he said, &quot;and the bond market is going to be leading the stock market.&quot; He said bond investors simply don't want to take the risk of being caught by a surprisingly large January deficit.    &quot;My fixed-income manager told me that 'all I want to do is to be out of the way'&quot; before the trade figure is announced tomorrow, Mr. Wright said.    The bond market is especially wary of the trade report because an unexpectedly large January deficit could trigger additional weakness in the U.S. dollar, prompting the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates to defend the currency. Of course, higher interest rates would quickly be felt in the stock market, too, as current earnings forecasts and stock valuations would be called into question.    The consensus of economists polled by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report indicates that the January deficit is expected to widen to $12.8 billion from $12.2 billion in December. If such a widening is reported, it would be the result mostly of seasonal and technical factors and, analysts said, probably won't create any problems for financial markets. But a much larger deficit could trigger declines in stocks and bonds, they added.    The trade number isn't the only hurdle investors have to clear this week. Friday is the first &quot;triple witching hour&quot; of 1988. That's when March stock-index futures, options on the indexes and options on individual stocks expire. In the past, such combined expirations often sparked extreme volatility in the stock market. This expiration carries an added uncertainty because margin requirements have been stiffened and it is uncertain how many traders will choose to withdraw from stock index futures and options rather than rolling over their positions into new contracts.    Some big computer stocks were walloped in heavy trading. Digital Equipment was among the biggest losers, down 2 1/2 to 116 1/4; International Business Machines fell 1 1/2 to 114 and Compaq lost 1 to 52 3/8.    NCR Corp. was hurt by cautious analysts' comments for the second day in a row. The stock fell 1 3/8 to 60 7/8 yesterday after a Dean Witter analyst reduced his estimate on NCR's first-quarter earnings. Earlier, a Gartner Group analyst cautioned investors that NCR had weak domestic orders for January and had been engaging in price cutting abroad. NCR also introduced a new family of multiuser computers. Apple Computer lost 1 1/4 to 45. The company cut the suggested list price of its Macintosh Plus personal computer.    Airline stocks gained on the prospect of sharply higher fares. Delta Air was up 1 1/8 to 47 3/8; Allegis gained 1 1/4 to 79 1/2; Southwest Airlines rose 3/8 to 17 1/4; NWA Inc. climbed 5/8 to 43 1/2; USAir Group rose 1/2 to 35 3/8, and Texas Air was up 7/8 to 12 7/8.    Takeover targets turned in a mixed performance. Firestone was up 1 1/2 to 63 1/8 after it disclosed that it is exploring various options in response to Pirelli Group's takeover bid. The options include discussions with Japan's Bridgestone to determine what course Bridgestone might pursue. Firestone said that because of the Pirelli offer it's unlikely to complete the proposed sale of 75% of its tire making and wholesaling operation to Bridgestone.    Compugraphic gained 1 3/8 to 25 3/4 after it became the newest takeover target. It agreed to a $27-a-share bid from Agfa-Gevaert.    Koppers gained 2 3/4 to 54 1/2. The company must respond to Beazer PLC's $45-a-share takeover bid by 5 p.m. EST today. Koppers had no comment on rumors that it was preparing to announce a leveraged buy-out at $55 to $60 a share.    Federated Department Stores was off 1/4 to 65 3/4; J.P. Stevens gained 7/8 to 62, and American Standard closed at 75 1/8, up 3/4.    CertainTeed rose 1 5/8 to 47 1/8 after Compagnie de Saint-Gobain said it was increasing its offer for all of CertainTeed's common shares to $47.50 a share from $41. Saint-Gobain already owns about 57% of CertainTeed's common.    Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber closed at 62 5/8, up 2 5/8, boosted by a Bear Stearns analyst's recommendation of the stock based on its low price-to-earnings multiple and its prospects for the coming year. Additionally, the company disclosed in its annual report that it plans to build its first new tire plant in 10 years, an indication to analysts that Goodyear probably has increased its market share.    Minnesota Mining rose 1 1/4 to 62 3/8 after a Morgan Stanley analyst raised her investment rating on the stock to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;hold.&quot; She also increased her 1988 earnings estimate to $4.80 a share from $4.45, reflecting a more bullish stance on the economy at Morgan Stanley.    Monsanto continued to decline following Monday's disclosure of documents that indicate the company's G.D. Searle unit misled regulators about the safety of its Copper-7 intrauterine device. The stock was off 3 1/4 to 80 1/8.    Stanhome shot up 2 3/4 to 36 1/8 after Shearson Lehman Hutton gave the stock its highest &quot;buy&quot; rating.    Carolina Freight continued to gain for the third consecutive day, although the company said it isn't aware of any reason the stock would be rising. It closed up 1 1/8 to 24 3/8.    Calton lost 1 3/8 to 4 1/8 after investor Michael Weinstein said he had scrapped plans to make a tender offer for it.    Pennzoil gained 1 1/2 to 76. It said it entered a 20-year agreement to supply oil to the entire Jiffy Lube International system in the U.S.    Two drug companies were among the big losers yesterday. Warner-Lambert was off 1 1/8 to 71 1/2 and Schering-Plough was down 5/8 to 53. </TEXT></DOC>
