SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AAPLCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Apple Computer Inc., almost as well-known for its penchant for show business as for its computers, today will introduce two new models of its Macintosh personal computer at a glitzy Hollywood bash.    The new computers, called the Macintosh II and the Macintosh SE, signal Apple's first direct challenge to high-performance personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which are still waiting on crucial software developments to unlock their full capabilities.    More powerful and expensive than earlier Macintoshes, which were known more for snazzy graphics than for raw computing power, the new models are designed to allow expansion and customizing and can even be modified to mimic IBM and compatible personal computers.    The models, products of a $150 million, 18-month development effort, also represent the first time Apple has been able to coordinate with the introduction of products from other companies that immediately tap the new features and capabilities of the new Apple computers.    Moreover, as Apple moves its product line into the more expensive and sophisticated markets for engineering workstations, professional publishing systems and serious business management applications, the company's retail dealer network will have to find ways of selling computer systems that are better suited to those more sophisticated markets.    &quot;What was the top of our line of business computers last week is now the bottom of our line,&quot; said John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;With these products,&quot; he asserted in an interview, &quot;innovation is back as the driving force of our industry.&quot;    Industry analysts given sneak previews of the new machines were impressed with the Macintosh II, the more sophisticated of the two new models. But reactions to the Macintosh SE were more subdued, mainly because that model offers only limited advantages over Apple's existing Macintosh computers. Nevertheless, analysts predicted both machines would sell well.    &quot;Apple's been a hot company lately, and despite some drawbacks, these products could make it a supernova,&quot; said Stewart Alsop, publisher of PC Letter, a personal computer newsletter.    Indeed, trading activity in Apple shares in the national over-the-counter market indicates investors have high hopes for the new computers and for Apple in general. Last week alone, Apple shares increased 11% to close Friday at a record price of $70 each, up 87.5 cents.    The Macintosh II, which is four times as fast as the current Macintosh Plus, is Apple's most advanced computer yet. In terms of computer power, it rivals some of the most sophisticated personal computers and engineering workstations costing $8,000 and more.    The model is built around a state-of-the-art Motorola Corp. 68020 microprocessor and features optional color graphics and six expansion slots to allow the addition of more memory, special features or IBM compatibility. Like IBM and most IBM-compatible personal computers, the pale, gray Macintosh II consists of three pieces -- the computer, the keyboard and the monitor. Apple said it will be available in limited quantities in May, with complete systems priced from about $4,800 to $10,000.    The Macintosh SE is a more modest machine with slight enhancements over Apple's flagship product, the Macintosh Plus. Both models are built around the Motorola 68000 microprocessor and both are two-piece machines with a keyboard connected to a single box containing a black-and-white monitor and the computer circuitry. The Macintosh SE also includes two floppy disk drives and one expansion slot for adding special features.    The SE model will be available immediately at system prices from $2,898 to $4,500. The Macintosh Plus, with one floppy disk drive and no slots, is priced at $2,199. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple said it expects the SE model to account for 50% of its Macintosh unit sales within a few months.    Industry analysts who have seen the new machines have high praise for the Macintosh II. &quot;On a strictly technical basis,&quot; said Peter Teige, a personal computer market analyst for Dataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif., &quot;the Macintosh II is superior in both price and performance to the Compaq Deskpro 386&quot; -- the most advanced IBM-compatible personal computer currently on the market.    Even so, analysts were surprised that despite its dazzling color graphics and computing speed, the Macintosh II can't perform more than one program at a time, a requirement for engineering workstations and other high performance machines.    &quot;As Apple itself pushes the importance of communications between computers, multitasking will become a pressing need very soon,&quot; said Norman DeWitt, another analyst at Dataquest. &quot;True networking requires a computer to do at least two things at once.&quot;    Mr. Sculley said Apple didn't view multitasking as a &quot;staggering need&quot; but said that someday the Macintosh II's operating system would be enhanced to allow it. &quot;It's something we obviously believe is important at some point.&quot;    Analysts' opinions of the Macintosh SE were mixed. Mr. DeWitt thought the machine &quot;gives the market what it wanted a year ago,&quot; though he said &quot;it will draw a lot of store traffic and probably sell well.&quot;    Apple didn't give precise sales figures or estimates. Dataquest, however, said Apple sold about 405,000 Macintoshes last year, and projected that it will sell between 575,000 and 600,000 this year. Of that number, about 100,000 will be Macintosh SEs, 30,000 to 40,000 Macintosh IIs and the rest mostly Macintosh Pluses.    Mr. Alsop, however, was critical of the Macintosh SE, and of Apple's strategy with the two new machines in general. &quot;It's a slap in the face to consumers, which I find surprising coming from Apple,&quot; he said. The problem, he contended, is that there is no way for existing Apple owners to upgrade their computers to the new models without buying a whole new computer.    A profusion of products from third-party manufacturers will help address some of those criticisms, Apple asserts. In conjunction with Apple's new products, at least 50 other companies will announce products to go with them, including updated software, a variety of monitors, and upgrade cards to boost the power of a Macintosh SE. For example, AST Research Inc., Irvine, Calif., will supply the cards that make the new computers compatible with IBM personal computers.    Apple initially wanted to make the IBM-compatibility cards itself, as well as a high-performance data-base program, but the company opted to move more quickly by handing both projects to outside concerns. Mr. Sculley said confusion over the various IBM-compatible computers and operating systems has created an opportunity for the Macintoshes.    &quot;We wanted to make sure that while we have this window that we take advantage of it,&quot; Mr. Sculley said. &quot;And we can't do it without third-party companies.&quot;    By offering more expensive and complicated computers, Apple also must find more sophisticated ways of selling them. &quot;You don't walk into a store to buy an engineering workstation,&quot; said Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative Strategies Inc., a personal computer marketing consulting firm based in Santa Clara, Calif. &quot;Apple will have to find a way to help its dealers grow more sophisticated in their marketing.&quot;    Mr. Sculley said Apple is encouraging its dealers to engage more in &quot;outbound sales.&quot; &quot;Two years from now you won't even recognize the reseller market,&quot; he said. &quot;Businessland Inc. and our other high-end dealers are committed to working some big changes in the way small systems are sold.&quot;    Apple's decision, however, to make its computers capable of running IBM programs struck some analysts as a sales ploy rather than a useful feature, especially as computer communications improve. &quot;The IBM cards are just a marketing gimmick to enable people to say they're buying compatible machines,&quot; asserted Mr. Bajarin. &quot;I doubt if AST sells very many of them.&quot;    Even Mr. Sculley questioned the usefulness of Macintosh SE and II computers as IBM clones. &quot;Quite frankly, I don't know why anybody would want IBM compatibility in a Macintosh,&quot; said Mr. Sculley. &quot;But as long as people say they want it, we'll make it possible.&quot;    ---   The New Macs   Macintosh II   Microprocessor: Motorola Inc. 68020 32-bit    Memory: 1 megabyte up to 1.5 gigabytes   Monitors: 12-inch black and white or 13-inch color    Expansion slots: Six   Disk drives: 800 kilobyte floppy standard.
