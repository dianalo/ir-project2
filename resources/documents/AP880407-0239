(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A grand jury Thursday indicted twostate legislators, the mayor and 13 other political figures in amountain coal county already wracked by charges of job-selling anddrug-dealing by local officials.   One indictment charged a state senator who was a former countycommissioner with bribery in the alleged sale of the Mingo Countysheriff's job in 1982 for $100,000, and another indictment accused15 others of violations of state election laws and conspiracy.   The 15 are accused of conspiring with Johnie M. Owens, theformer sheriff and former county Democratic Party chairman, andothers to influence elections in 1984 and 1986 and law enforcementin the county.   ``The indictment charges this group of people with attemptingbasically to subvert the free election system in Mingo County,''said special prosecutor James Colburn. ``They conspired ... byillegal campaign contributions, by illegal campaign expenditures,by bribery, by false accounting, and by conspiring to do all thesethings.''   Mingo County, the site of the Hatfied-McCoy Fued betweenmountain clans after the Civil War, is a coal-mining county of37,000 people along the Kentucky border. Williamson, the largesttown, has about 6,000 residents.   A federal grand jury indicted several current and former countyofficials over the past year, including current Sheriff Charles``Eddie'' Hilbert, in connection with his appointment as sheriff.   Owens, who has pleaded guilty, said he accepted a $20,000 downpayment on the $100,000 bribe from Hilbert, then persuaded thethree county commissioners to accept his resignation and appointHilbert in exchange for half of the bribe.   Former Commissioner Rastie Runyon also has pleaded guilty andwill be sentenced with Owens on April 18, the same day Hilbert isscheduled to enter a plea in a drug case as part of an agreementwith prosecutors.   In the drug case, authorities say a drug ring openly run by asmall-town fire chief, police chief and their families wasprotected by a web of bribes to officials.   Commissioner Steve Adkins, the only member of the 1982 CountyCommission still in office, was indicted earlier on one count ofbribery. He has denied the charge but is not running forre-election.   The third commissioner, state Sen. H. Truman Chafin, wasindicted Thursday with one felony count of bribery.   Arraignment for all defendants is scheduled Wednesday in MingoCounty Circuit Court.   Democratic Sen. John Pat Fanning was charged with two counts ofbribery, one count of conspiracy and one count of filing falseaccounts _ all felonies _ and one count each of making politicalcontributions exceeding the state limits and failing to reportpolitical expenditures, both misdemeanors.   Mingo County Prosecutor W. Thomas Ward was indicted on fivefelony counts, three counts of bribery and one each of conspiracyand filing false accounts, plus two misdemeanors. Williamson MayorSam Kapourales was indicted on two felony counts _ bribery andconspiracy _ and two misdemeanor counts.   Chafin denied having anything to do with sale of the sheriff'soffice.   ``I received no money or benefit as a result of thistransaction,'' he said. ``I was not there when the commission votedon these matters, nor did I agree with anyone at any time not to bepresent at that meeting.''   Fanning was out of his office late Thursday afternoon and wasunavailable for comment, a person answering the phone in his officesaid. Neither Ward nor Kapourales was in his office and could notbe reached for comment by telephone.   Also named as defendants are county school board members PaulSizemore and Robert Simpkins, former Delegates James B. Simpkins,Irvine K.O. Damron, and R. Doyle Van Meter II, County CommissionersRonnie Rumora and Steve Adkins, former Mingo County Magistrate JoeyKohari, Magistrate Bill Webb, former Circuit Court Clerk Robert J.``Jack'' Webb, former County Clerk Hugh Wellman and Larry Hamrick,a former school board member and former director of the county'santi-poverty agency.   Also indicted Thursday was Goodwill Motors Inc., a used cardealership at Delbarton owned by former county commissioner andcounty Democratic Chairman Stewart Justice. Justice was not namedin the indictment.   Last week, grand jurors heard testimony from candidates in the1984 and 1986 primary elections as well as United Mine WorkersLocal 1440 President Bill Davis and Wally Warden, editor of theWilliamson Daily News.   The newspaper has extensively covered the state and federalprobes in Mingo County, and Warden provided jurors with backgroundon the makeup of campaign slates in past elections and withinformation on precincts that have been the site of votingirregularities.   Davis reportedly was questioned about campaign contributions andfinancial support from COMPAC, the UMW's political action committee.</TEXT></DOC>
