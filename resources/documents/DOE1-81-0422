It is shown that the sun-alignedarcs appear in the polar cap with a delay-time of about an hour relativeto the northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) andthat they can remain for many hours provided the IMF is invariable. Thedistribution of these aurorae in the dayside polar cap displays a {theta}-shapedpattern which is clearly separated from the latitude-oriented arcs inthe auroral oval. Disappearance of the sun-aligned arcs after the southwardturning of the IMF occurs much faster: in 10-15 min. The observationof the polar cap arcs immersed in a wide band of diffuse luminescenceimplies that the sun-aligned arcs should be located within the {theta}-auroratranspolar band. It is concluded that the distribution of the auroraein the polar cap, auroral oval and in the day-side cusp requires a closedstructure for the magnetosphere. The convection pattern correspondingto a closed magnetosphere suggests the formation of closed cavities witha stagnation plasma regime in the distant tail of the magnetosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
