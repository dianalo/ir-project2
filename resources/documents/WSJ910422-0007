Backers promise a huge, prosperingNorth American market that surpasses anything Europe or Japancan hope for.   Somewhere in the middle lies the most likely outcome, butwhere? Strongly held ideological beliefs continue to colordebates over trade as they have for centuries. Simpleeconomic models can't cope with the complexities ofmultinational corporations, illegal immigrants andchild-labor laws that are enforced in some places and ignoredin others.</LP><TEXT>   Looking at the U.S. economy, many economists say that aU.S.-Mexico free-trade pact won't be terribly significant.The U.S. economy is 25 times the size of the Mexican economy,and many trade barriers already have been dismantled. Thepact's true significance lies in Mexico, where it and relatedU.S. aid, debt relief and investment could make or breakhopes for a stronger economy.   Simply eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers wouldhave &quot;almost no effect on the U.S. economy . . . it's justtrivial,&quot; says economist Sherman Robinson of the Universityof California at Berkeley, who developed a computer model tosimulate the impact of a free-trade agreement, which hefavors. A study by the U.S. International Trade Commission of19 industries found that a trade pact would have a negligibleeffect on 17 of them. An examination of 44 industries donefor U.S. and Mexican business interests by KPMG Peat Marwickcame to similar conclusions.   But even ardent fans of the pact acknowledge that it wouldinflict pain on some segments of the U.S. economy. On thebusiness side, the most likely loser would be such industriesas citrus growing that rely on trade barriers to keeplower-priced Mexican wares out of the U.S. market. The otherbig losers would be unskilled workers, such as those who workin the apparel industry, whose jobs are most vulnerable tocompetition from low-paid workers in other nations.   Economists aligned with the administration, and generallypredisposed to favor freer trade, say the pluses wouldoutweigh those minuses. &quot;It will make the U.S. morecompetitive,&quot; says President Bush's chief economic adviser,Michael Boskin. &quot;It will help Mexico grow and, therefore,will help jobs in our export industries.&quot;   Skeptics focus on the risks to U.S. workers. &quot;Any smallgains are likely to be overwhelmed by larger job and incomelosses to American workers,&quot; says Jeff Faux, president of theEconomic Policy Institute, which is allied with organizedlabor in opposing the agreement. &quot;The real interest of thecorporations that are backing this isn't the Mexican market,it's the Mexican labor force.&quot;   The potential harm to the least-skilled U.S. workers isamong the most contentious issues. Economists at theInternational Trade Commission divided the U.S. work forceinto only two classes, skilled and unskilled. In a report toCongress earlier this year, they wrote, &quot;Unskilled workers inthe United States would suffer a slight decline in real (orinflation-adjusted) income, but U.S. skilled workers andowners of capital . . . would benefit more from lowerprices.&quot; In a footnote, the commission's economists said theysaw &quot;plausible scenarios&quot; in which incomes would increase forall workers.   The agreement's opponents seized on the study as evidencethat many U.S. workers would suffer, forcing the commissionto retreat. Citing new data, it now predicts unskilledworkers would see a slight increase in income.   In fact, there is a lot of guessing going on. With manyU.S.-owned factories already operating in the &quot;maquiladora&quot;zone along the U.S.-Mexico border, it isn't clear how manymore U.S. manufacturers would tolerate Mexico's inefficientrail system, dusty roads and largely uneducated work force toget low wages or fewer environmental restrictions. Nor is itclear, despite the hopes of the pact's backers, how manyfactories that would open in Mexico would otherwise haveended up in Asia. What's more, the impact of a pact will beoverwhelmed by trends in trade with larger nations and thegeneral health of the U.S. economy.   It's easier to find consensus on which industries stand tolose or gain the most from an agreement.   Take agriculture. Eliminating trade barriers likely willproduce a significant increase in imports of Mexican fruitsand vegetables and a more moderate increase in U.S. exports.The U.S. canned tuna industry and the U.S. sugar industry,both currently protected, would clearly suffer. But U.S.farmers who grow grain and oilseeds, such as soybeans,probably would see a surge in exports to Mexico.   Similarly, in manufacturing, the most likely U.S. losersare those industries most dependent on quotas or tariffs tokeep out imports. Both Peat Marwick and the trade commissionsingle out the apparel industry, although both studies insistthe harm will be minimal.   Exports most likely to benefit include cement,sophisticated electronics and communications gear, machinetools and household appliances. U.S. insurance companieswould benefit by fewer restrictions on foreign insurersoperating in Mexico.   In Canada, meanwhile, the Conservative Party government ofPrime Minister Brian Mulroney risks losing what littleremains of its popularity by joining the U.S. and Mexico intrade talks.   A recent opinion poll showed that 50% of Canadians wereopposed to Canada participating in the proposed trade talks.Opponents include the government of Canada's largestprovince, Ontario, labor unions, opposition political partiesand various nationalist and cultural groups.   Canadian business groups generally back the tradeinitiative, seeing it as a chance to expand the hard-wontrade gains Canada achieved in the U.S.-Canada free tradepact that took effect Jan. 1, 1989. But opponents of theproposed negotiations claim a broadening of the pact toinclude Mexico will cost Canadian jobs.   Canadian labor unions, like their U.S. counterparts, warnthat companies will shift their operations to Mexico to takeadvantage of Mexico's lower wages and looser environmentallaws. &quot;Canada is putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy byjumping into fast-track free-trade talks with the U.S. andMexico,&quot; said James McCambly, president of the CanadianFederation of Labor.   Free-trade opponents claim that Canada already hassuffered many plant closures because of the U.S.-Canada tradepact. But the government blames most of the shutdowns on ayear-old recession that has pushed the unemployment rate to10.5%. &quot;If you believe our critics, every sparrow that fellin the past three years was knocked off its perch by the(U.S.-Canada) free-trade agreement,&quot; said John Crosbie,Canada's trade minister.   Canada's trade with Mexico amounts to a fraction of itsbusiness with the U.S. Canadian exports to Mexico last yeartotaled only $517.8 million, less than 0.5% of Canada's totalexports of $123.04 billion. The U.S. is by far Canada'sbiggest export market, taking more than 75% of Canada'sexports last year. Canada's imports from Mexico last yeartotaled $1.5 billion, or 1.3% of Canada's total imports of$118.473 billion. The U.S. supplied 69% of Canada importslast year.   Canadian officials see Mexico as a potentially big buyerof Canadian goods, such as newsprint, mining products, masstransit and telecommunications equipment.   ---   John Urquhart in Ottawa contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
