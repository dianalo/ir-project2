 But don't let theplain looks fool you-ALS is a powerful compiler.andP;  It compiles all predicatesand eliminates the distinctions between interpreted and compiled code andstatic and dynamic predicates.andP;  In ALS Prolog, you can assert into andretract from compiled predicates since ALS will decompile the predicatesautomatically.andP;  You can list, edit, and debug code at any time-all whilerunning compiled code.andP;  This method avoids inconsistency between interpretedand compiled code.andP;  Constant compilation has the added reward of very fastrun-time during code development.andM;ALS Prolog is an Edinburgh-style Prolog, so porting code to and from ALS is asimple matter.andP;  ALS provides a large library of built-in predicates,including MS-DOS interface predicates and a window interface.andP;  The windowinterface is still a very primitive prototype package.andP;  For example, thepackage doesn't recognize the concept of a current window, so every call to awindow predicate needs to name the particular window being affected.andP;  Thismethod effectively eliminates the possibility of generic predicates thatcould be used to clear the window or make a menu in the window where thecurrent window is unknown.andP;  ALS doesn't seem to offer a predicate to close awindow, either.andP;  Source code is provided, however, for those inclined torewrite it.andM;ALS doesn't allow any system errors to be handled by the user.andP;  However, itdoes provide an exception handler in the form of two predicates, catch/2 andthrow/0.andP;  Catch/2 specifies a goal to call and an exception goal.andP;  Aftercalling the first goal, if throw/0 is encountered, the predicate fails.andO;Then, instead of backtracking to the most recent choice-point in the trailstack, the system backtracks to the state of the catch / 2 predicate andcalls the exception goal.andP;  When the exception goal is completed, controlreturns the call after the catch / 2 predicate.andM;ALS provides a foreign interface so you can write predicates in C or run a Cprogram that calls a Prolog program.andP;  In the case of C-coded predicates, ALSallows you either to dynamically link and load the predicates from withinProlog or to statically link and load the ALS Prolog and C code into oneexecutable program.andP;  Additionally, Prolog code can be spread among severalmodules in ALS so that access to procedures in different modules can becontrolled.andP;  However, constants are the same in every module, modules may notbe nested, and no more than 14 modules may be declared by the programmer.andM;ALS memory allocation is similar to that in Arity Prolog.andP;  Three memoryspaces are created: the heap (equivalent to Arity's global stack), localstack, and trail.andP;  The size of each area depends on the amount of memoryavailable to the system, subject to a maximum of 64K.andP;  The clause space inALS is limited to 40K, but the system can swap out unused procedures (up to apoint) to make room in this space.andP;  However, we abandoned compilation of alarge program (the same one that exhausted evaluation space under Quintus andran under Arity) because of a fatal error caused by  insufficient space inthe clause area.andM;The documentation is disappointing.andP;  The Users Guide and Reference Manual (asingle volume) is incomplete and poorly indexed.andP;  It contains no descriptionsof any errors produced by the system and often directs the reader to thewrong page, or even the wrong section entirely.andP;  Nonetheless, thedescriptions of the built-in predicates are very clear and well-documented,with good examples on how to use each one.andP;  The cal Reference Mon al iscomplete and properly indexed, but its descriptions are too brief.andM;ALS comes with an editor called Z, produced by Manx Software Systems(Shrewsbury, N.J.) that is apparently a clone of the UNIX editor, vi.andP;  Theedit/0 predicate calls Z by default, but you can change the predicate to callyour favorite editor.andP;  A debugger is supplied, with the standard trace, spy,and leash, to allow you to spy on any predicate and its four ports _ call,redo, fail, and exit.andM;Portability of Edinburgh-style Prolog to ALS is easy, even effortless.andP;  ALScomplied all user-supplied or consulted code.andP;  No declarations or compilerdirectives of any kind were needed to run the benchmark tests.andP;  Declarationsare required only for using modules and exporting predicates from them.andP;  ALSProlog is the most user-friendly DOS Prolog when it comes to porting code.andM;The ALS compiler implements last-call and tail-recursion optimization on allcode, as well as special inline compilation of 16-bit integer arithmetic.andO;ALS did better than Quintus in the benchmarks.andP;  ALS also out-performed Arityon a third of the tests, but these differences are fairly minor (except onthe integer-add test, where ALS arithmetic optimization is clearly superior).andO;Incidentally, ALS has just released versions of ALS Prolog 1.0 forprotected-mode DOS,</TEXT></DOC>
