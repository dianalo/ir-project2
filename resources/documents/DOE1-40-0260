Its objectivewas to instrument, monitor, assess, and report on the energy performanceand reliablility of the solar energy demonstration projects sponsoredby the Ministry, which were located on government buildings, and on commercial,industrial, municipal, institutional, and religious buildings. This projectwas initiated in order to obtain information about the real performanceof solar energy systems in Ontario. The opportunity to monitor a largenumber of solar energy systems with increasingly versatile and complexequipment is bounded by many constraints, including the following: capitalcosts of installed monitoring equipment; annual operating costs; availabilityof skilled manpower on schedule; availability of equipment on schedule;ease of installation of equipment; accessibility of the sites; complexityof collected data; requirement for expert observation on site; availabilityof committed future funds. 51 figs., 128 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
