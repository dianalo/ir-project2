In exchange for the release, Washington will provide economicaid, gradually release billions of dollars in Iranian funds frozenin U.S. banks and resume diplomatic relations with Tehran, theEnglish-language weekly The Nation said in a report from Geneva.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleydenied the report. ``There have been no such meetings. The story isnot true. It is all false,'' she said.   The Nation said in its unattributed report that the secretnegotiations between Tehran and Washington began in Geneva onMonday. The newspaper began publishing four weeks ago so it wasdifficult to judge the report's credibility.   The Iranian delegation told U.S. representatives that thepro-Iranian Shiite Moslems holding the hostages in Lebanon demanded$3 million in ransom and immunity from prosecution, The Nationsaid. The captors appear to have dropped their demand for therelease of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists held in Kuwait, the newspapersaid.   The American delegates responded that they were not in aposition to pay ransom, the report said.   Under an agreement worked out in Geneva, five American hostageswill be released around Oct. 7, and the second group of threeAmericans and an Englishman is to be freed a week later, the reportsaid.   Nine Americans are held hostage in Lebanon. The Iranians toldthe American delegates they did not know the whereabouts of one ofthe hostages _ U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, The Nationsaid. Higgins, 41, was a U.N. peacekeeper kidnapped Feb. 17.   The Iranians said they knew only that Higgins was spiritedaboard a fishing boat off Tyre and carried to a larger vesselwaiting at sea, the newspaper said.   The British hostage is thought to be Anglican Church envoy TerryWaite, who disappeared in Lebanon last year, The Nation said.   In all, 17 foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon. TerryAnderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, is the longest held hostage. Anderson, an American, waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   ``This round of talks lasted 4{ days,'' Giora Shamis, the authorof the report, told The Associated Press. ``There will be moretalks on what's going to happen before the release'' of thehostages.   Asked about his sources, Shamis said he had been in Genevarecently and that two of his reporters were there talking to theIranians and the Americans.   Shamis said he owns the London-based news service Depth, whichsold the story to The Nation.   Hesh Kestin, the newspaper's editor and managing editor, couldnot immediately be reached for comment.   In a related development, The Nation said Iran'scommander-in-chief, Hashemi Rafsanjani, narrowly escapedassassination in Tehran on Sept. 23.   Quoting unidentified sources, The Nation said assailants firedautomatic weapons on Rafsanjani's motorcade, killing four of hisbodyguards.</TEXT></DOC>
