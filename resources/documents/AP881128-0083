The Commerce Department said that the imbalance between importsand exports narrowed to $28.5 billion in the year's third quarter.   It was the lowest quarterly deficit since the first quarter of1985 and reflected the continued improvement the country has enjoyedin trade this year.   The decline followed a revised 14.3 percent narrowing in thesecond quarter, when it shrank to $30.15 billion. In the first threemonths of the year, the deficit had fallen by 14.6 percent.   For the first nine months of this year, the trade deficit hasbeen running at an annual rate of $125.2 billion, down 22 percentfrom the record deficit of $160.3 billion in 1987.   Economists believe this trend will hold for the final threemonths of the year, marking the first annual improvement in thecountry's trade balance since President Reagan took office in 1981.   The new figures confirmed an improvement already evident in thedepartment's monthly merchandise trade reports. Those figures showedthe deficit declining by 3.2 percent to $32.2 billion in the thirdquarter, compared to $33.2 billion in the second quarter.   Today's figures are smaller because they subtract such factors asshipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers.   The new report said that U.S. exports climbed 3.4 percent to$82.3 billion. It was the seventh consecutive quarterly increase inU.S. sales abroad and pushed exports to a record level.   Imports also rose, but by a smaller 0.9 percent to $110.8 billionas a drop in oil shipments helped offset a rise in non-petroleumimports.   The average number of barrels of oil imported daily rose to 7.54million, up from 7.4 million. However, the average price of a barrelof oil fell from $15.16 to $14.22. The price drop helped to narrowthe country's foreign oil bill by 4 percent to $9.9 billion in thethird quarter.   Offsetting the decline in oil imports were widespread increasesin car shipments.   Foreign car shipments from Canada climbed by 12 percent while thenumber of passenger cars from West Germany increased 34 percent. Carimports from South Korea were up 29 percent and Japanese shipmentsrose 16 percent.   The average price of a Japanese car edged down by 1 percent whilethe price of West German cars dropped a sharp 18 percent afterposting big gains for several quarters.   Most U.S. export categories showed increases. Sales of farmproduce rose 8 percent to $10.4 billion, the highest level since thesecond quarter of 1982.   The increase was more than accounted for by higher prices,reflecting the drought in the farm belt.   Corn exports increased 48 percent and total soybean sales were up49 percent.   The average price of corn rose by 30 percent while soybean priceswere up 28 percent and wheat prices rose 25 percent.   As usual, the largest deficit was recorded with Japan, anincrease of $100 million to $12 billion for the quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
