Gonzalez, 47, seeks an unprecedented third term for his SocialistParty.   He said he is calling elections eight months before the legal endof the current four-year legislative session ``to seek a new mandateto meet the important challenges'' when Western Europe drops tradebarriers in 1993.   ``What we seek is sustained economic growth to continue jobcreation, our prime objective,'' Gonzalez told reporters.   He touted the booming Spanish economy that has averaged aEuropean-high 4.5 percent annual growth since 1986, the year thecountry joined the European Economic Community. But he also warnedagainst runaway consumer spending.   King Juan Carlos will sign a decree Saturday setting electionsfor Oct. 29.   The date chosen is seven years and a day from the Oct. 28, 1982,landslide victory that gave the Socialists their first absolutemajority of 202 seats in the 350-seat lower house of Parliament.   Gonzalez also seeks to take advantage of disarray among centristand rightist forces.   A major factor in his decision is considered the Socialists'performance in June 15 European Parliament elections.   The Socialists won 39.5 percent of votes, enough to gain anothermajority in Parliament and govern alone through 1993, analysts said.   If re-elected, Gonzalez is expected to take stiff measures tocurtail demand and try to maintain the economy's momentum, needed toreduce Spain's 17.3 percent unemployment rate, Europe's highest.   Observers say a clear Socialist victory will relieve pressurefrom unions seeking greater social spending. A long-running disputebetween the government and the Socialist General Workers Union ledto a one-day national strike by workers Dec. 14 that paralyzed thecountry. But the Socialists appear to have regained momentum sincethat low point in popular support.   Socialists now hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house ofParliament. The Popular Party holds 91, the centrists 28, and theconservative Catalan minority 19. Smaller parties hold the rest.</TEXT></DOC>
