Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., actingchairman of the House Ways and Means human resources subcommittee.   Downey said his Family Preservation Act, introduced with severalco-sponsors, would build on existing programs to prevent drug abuseamong pregnant women, help ``boarder babies'' left in hospitals bycrack-addicted mothers and expand social services to help find waysto keep families together.   He estimated it would cost $500 million the first year soundedundaunted by the intense competition over scarce federal funds.   The timing of the bill, he said, was intended to take advantageof upcoming budget talks between congressional leaders and the Bushadministration, to ensure that if taxes are increased, the moneywill not be used just to defray the budget deficit.   The Bush administration's budget to fund the National DrugControl Strategy calls for about $350 million for prevention andtreatment for pregnant women who use drugs and for their children,said Daryl Kade of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.   Legislation co-sponsor Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said thebill responds to problems unanticipated 10 years ago, such aswidespread drug use, AIDS, child abuse and neglect, that ``havecome together to overwhelm the child welfare system, to overwhelmthe foster care and adoption system in this country.''   The announcement of the legislation coincided with the releaseof a congressional study requested by Downey called, ``The EnemyWithin: Crack-Cocaine and America's Families.''   The report compiles findings of previously reported studies andnotes that:   _An estimated 375,000 children born each year are exposed tosome drug while in the womb.   _More than 100,000 cocaine-exposed babies were born in 1988 andstudies have said that number could reach 500,000 to 4 million bythe year 2000.   _About 360,000 children were placed in foster care in 1989, a 29percent increase over 1986, with the largest increases in citieshit hardest by crack.   _Despite the publicity over boarder babies, the problem ``maynot be as severe as the media coverage would indicate,'' affectingonly certain hospitals in certain cities. In addition, studies havefound that many mothers remain in contact with their children andare prevented by authorities from taking them home.</TEXT></DOC>
