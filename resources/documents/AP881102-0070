The four regional utilities named in news reports as havingdecided not to renew long-term contracts are Tohoku Electric PowerCo., Kansai Electric Power Co., Chubu Electric Power Co. and KyushuElectric Power Co. The Kansai utility refused comment today, but theothers confirmed the change.   The four utilities own 16 of the 35 nuclear reactors operating inJapan and have seven more under construction or planned. Japan getsabout 29 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants.   Japan has been embarrassed by its emergence as South Africa'sbiggest trading partner while others among its Western allies havereduced commercial links in a drive against South Africa's apartheidpolicy of racial separation.   The Japanese government has said it is monitoring such trade _ animplicit warning of possible sanctions against companies thatincrease trade with South Africa.   In 1986, the government urged utilities to refrain from enteringnew contracts with South Africa, said Nobuo Tanaka, director forinternational nuclear energy affairs in the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry.   ``Since then no new contracts have been made, and we understandthat our utilities will not go into any new contract with SouthAfrican mines,'' the official said in a telephone interview todaywith The Associated Press.   Tokyo Electric Power Co., the world's largest private utility,says it has sought assurances from the British-based supplier RTZ,or Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp., that it will not receive uranium fromSouth-West Africa, which is also known as Namibia.   Tanaka said the situation regarding South-West Africa, whichPretoria governs in defiance of a United Nations resolution, is morecomplicated because of the circuitous route uranium follows as it isprocessed in several stages to be usable in nuclear reactors.   RTZ-supplied uranium may come from Namibia or other sources, hesaid, but it goes through a conversion process in Britain and thenis enriched in the United States by the U.S. Department of Energybefore it reaches Japan.   ``The Japanese government position is that there is no way toidentify the country of origin'' of such uranium, said Tanaka.   But he said Japan wanted to comply with a U.N. decree restrictingeconomic support of South Africa's administration of Namibia. ``Theutilities of course know such a decree is there. They also have beenrespecting this decree,'' Tanaka said.   ``They are cautious entering into new contracts,'' he added.   Spokesman Yasuho Takaya of the Tohuku utility said his companywas not renewing contracts with RTZ that end this year and thosewith the South African supplier that end next year.   ``We have the same position as the Japanese government,'' Takayasaid. ``We don't like apartheid.''   He said the Tohoku utility obtains 10 percent of its uranium fromSouth Africa and 10 percent from RTZ through Britain. Its majorsources are 60 percent from Canada and 20 percent from Niger. Thecompany has ample stocks to draw on, he said.   Tokyo Electric Power Co., which has 11 operating reactors, saidit has never received South African uranium but was concerned aboutthe origin of uranium supplied by RTZ.</TEXT></DOC>
