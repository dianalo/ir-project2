Thep-mode oscillations are clearly seen in the data. Using Fourier transformsin the temporal and spatial domain, it was shown that the p-modes dominatethe autocorrelation lifetime in magnetic regions. When these oscillationsare removed the autocorrelation lifetime is found to be 500 sec in quietand 950 sec in magnetic regions. In quiet areas exploding granules areseen to be common. It is speculated that a significant fraction of granulelifetimes are terminated by nearby explosions. Using local correlationtracking techniques it was able to measure horizontal displacements,and thus transverse velocities, in the magnetic field. In quiet sun itis possible to detect both super and mesogranulation. Horizontal velocitiesare as great as 1000 m/s and the average velocity is 400 m/s. In magneticregions horizontal velocities are much less, about 100 m/s.</TEXT></DOC>
