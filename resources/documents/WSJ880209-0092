According to the semiannual report, which the Agriculture Department released after Friday's close, as of Jan. 1, the nation's herd was down 3% from year-earlier levels at about 99 million head. In addition the report found that the number of calves under 500 pounds -- those that could be fattened for slaughter later in the year -- was down 10% from year-earlier levels at 20.9 million. Analysts had been looking for a 2% decline in the herd and a 5% drop in young cattle.    The declines, particularly the number of young cattle, is a signal that beef supplies will continue to be tight for much of the year. &quot;We're not saving animals to replenish the numbers. Things are going to get tighter and tighter,&quot; said Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Chicago.    The sharpest gains on the day were made in months for delivery this summer and fall. The contract for February settlement finished at 71.67 cents a pound, up 1.05 cents, but the August contract made the sharpest gains closing at 68.20 cents a pound, up 1.15 cents.    Firmer cash prices buoyed contracts for near-term delivery. Those contracts also got a lift from continued tight supplies, which are due mostly to the constant battering cattle-producing regions have taken from the weather this winter. The storms have limited animals' gains and hurt the young and sick. &quot;We've had at least one storm a week some place and we haven't been finishing them (cattle) on time,&quot; said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis.    But expectations of moderating weather and a normal hog slaughter hurt the hog contract for settlement this month. The strength in the cattle market helped contracts for later delivery close higher. Sinking cash prices pushed pork belly contracts lower.    In other futures markets yesterday:   ENERGY: Oil prices rose world-wide, supported by rumors of a developing supply &quot;squeeze&quot; in Europe like the one that buoyed prices in early January. Prices also were helped by anticipation that weekly American Petroleum Institute statistics due tonight will show a fall in heating-oil stocks. In New York, crude closed at $17.66 a barrel, up 38 cents, the highest close in a month. Earlier, North Sea Brent crude in Europe traded 40 cents higher on the squeeze rumors, at $16.85. The Brent supply situation is shaping up to be a &quot;carbon copy&quot; of early January, said Nauman Barakat, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Technical-oriented traders, meanwhile, were heartened that the New York market broke from its $16.70-to-$17.50 range. Chris McCormack, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. broker, said, &quot;17.50 was a key level. People had been talking about it for weeks.&quot; Still, Richard D. Donovan, head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s international energy desk, said while the technical move was &quot;a positive sign,&quot; he doesn't put too much emphasis on it. There still are few fundamental reasons for bullishness amid the world oil glut, analysts said.    SUGAR: Prices extended Friday's declines, with the March contract settling at 8.15 cents a pound, for a loss of 0.64 cent. There were no fresh developments, Debra Tropp, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, noted, but disappointment continued over the likelihood that the Soviet Union won't be the major buyer traders had originally thought. The price of the March contract early in the session broke below 8.60 cents, which had been a main support level since last September and that triggered widespread speculative selling that drove the March contract as low as 7.95 cents before it rebounded. The Soviet Union is expected to produce 9.7 million tons of sugar, one million tons more than last season, Miss Tropp said. If Cuba can supply four million tons, as it did last year, that, combined with an estimated 500,000 tons the Soviets were credited with buying some time ago would bring Soviet supplies to 14.2 million tons, or about 300,000 tons short of its estimated needs, she said. &quot;If Cuba can even marginally increase its shipments, the Soviet Union may not have to buy any sugar or very little,&quot; said Miss Tropp.    ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell for the third consecutive session as milder temperatures diminished freeze threats to orange-growing areas of Florida. The March contract ended near the lows of the day, at $1.666 a pound, for a decline of 3.55 cents. This represents a drop of 10.4 cents from the high of $1.77 last Wednesday. Temperatures in Orlando and Tampa, along the northern edge of the citrus belt, are expected to rise into the 60s by Thursday and then cool somewhat, but any chance of freezing weather moving into Florida next weekend is speculative, said Dan Kottlowski, senior forecaster for Accu-Weather Inc., State College, Pa. </TEXT></DOC>
