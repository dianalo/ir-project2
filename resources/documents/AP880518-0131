They called for, among other things, independent oversight ofsafety activites at the department's plants, as provided for insome of the five different bills on the subject being considered byCongress.   The groups did not collectively endorse any of the bills.``There are bits and pieces of each'' that deserve support, saidTim Connor of the Hanford Education Action League in Washingtonstate.   The groups said they would cooperate in lobbying efforts, butwere not forming any umbrella organization.   The Energy Department is expected to propose in July a newreactor to produce tritium, which decays rapidly and must berenewed in stored weapons from time to time.   The groups' proposal called for a public demonstration thatadditional nuclear weapons materials are needed; independentlicensing of new plants and safety regulation; provisions forpublic participation in licensing; compliance with all federal andstate environmental laws; a federal commitment to pay all clenaupcosts; long-term health studies of nearby residents and jobretraining for displaced workers when plants close.   ``This is not a ban-the-bomb statement,'' said Connor.   Groups participating were the Environmental Policy Institute;Greenpeace; American Friends Service Committee; Puget Sound SANE,Seattle; Palouse Clearwater Hanford Watch, Moscow, Idaho; OhioPublic Interest Campaign, Cincinnati; Northwest Nuclear SafetyCampaign, Seattle; Snake River Alliance, Ketchum, Idaho; HanfordEducation Action League, Spokane, Wash.; Fernald Residents forEnvironmental Safety and Health, Harrison, Ohio; Energy ResearchFoundation, Columbia, S.C.; Colorado Peace Network, Denver;Coalition for Safe Power, Portland, Ore., and Citizens AgainstRocky Flats Contamination, Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
