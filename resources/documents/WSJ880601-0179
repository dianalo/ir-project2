The Ariane-4's first mission will be to place three satellites into geostationary orbit: the European weather satellite Meteosat P2, the U.S. telecommunications Pan American Satellite 1 and the amateur radio satellite Amsat 111C.    The new rocket is considerably more powerful than the current Ariane-3 series, capable of putting as much as 4.2 tons of payload into geostationary orbit, compared with Ariane-3's 2.6-ton maximum.    The Ariane-4 rocket is based on the same technology as its predecessors but has an extended first stage and as many as four strap-on boosters.    If the demonstration flight is successful, the rocket will be used over the next decade by Ariane-space, the commercial company set up by the European Space Agency, for commercial satellite launches. </TEXT></DOC>
