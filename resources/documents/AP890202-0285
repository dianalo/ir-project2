(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chevron USA Inc. has announced a``potentially significant discovery'' of natural gas in the Gulf ofMexico about 25 to 30 miles south of this Florida Panhandle resortcommunity.   If additional drilling confirms a commerical discovery, it wouldbe the first in Gulf waters off the Panhandle.   Oil companies have been drilling exploratory wells in the areasince the early 1970s but never have found profitable amounts of gasor oil.   The Chevron well is in a block the company leased jointly withConoco Inc., who will take over work at the site, including thedrilling of a second exploratory well, said Chevron spokesmanJohathan Lifa.   The new well is to be drilled this summer or early fall.   ``We can't tell from this first well by itself if we have thekind of reserves we need to support a commercial operation,'' Conocospokesman Michael O'Connor said Wednesday. ``But I think it's fairto say this is encouraging. We simply have to see what the potentialis.''   Lifa said it may be five years or more before a decision is madewhether to produce gas from the field.   If so, it could be an economic boost for the Panhandle in theform of onshore support and supply facilities, said Mike Zeigler ofthe West Florida Regional Planning Council.   Most onshore support operations for exploratory drilling in theregion have been based in Panama City, he said.   Core samples from Chevron's exploratory well and seismic testsindicated the presence of gas in a formation called Norphletsandstone, Lifa said.   Large gas fields in lower Mobile Bay in Alabama, about 50 mileswest of the new find, are in the same kind of formation.   The Chevron well is in 180 feet of water and was drilled to adepth of 22,572 feet.   Last April, the Interior Department described the Chevron welland an Amoco well south of Fort Walton Beach as being capable ofproducing paying quantities. But at that time the companies saidthey were still studying the drilling results.   Conoco and Chevron were among major buyers when the governmentoffered new leases at nearby sites in the Gulf last November.</TEXT></DOC>
