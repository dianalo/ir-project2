Probe Continues After Guilty Plea by Subsidiary</HEAD><BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A guilty plea by Gulf Power Co. has ended onephase of a lengthy federal investigation of the Florida utility'scorporate parent, The Southern Co., but the overall probe continues.   For more than a year a federal grand jury has investigatedallegations of tax fraud, improper accounting and illegal politicalcontributions by Atlanta-based Southern and some of its fiveutility subsidiaries.   On Tuesday, Pensacola-based Gulf Power pleaded guilty to chargesof conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and to impedethe Internal Revenue Service. The company paid a $500,000 fine,which it may not pass along to its customers.   U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr Jr. said he considered the GulfPower plea significant but said his office still has much work inthe Southern Co. case.   ``The investigation is a very active one,'' Barr said. ``Weanticipate further activity, but exactly what will happen I can'tsay.''   The investigation of Gulf Power drew attention because of amysterious plane crash April 10 that killed a key figure in theinvestigation and the discovery of a dead canary _ perceived as agangland-style warning against ``singing'' _ by a grand jurywitness.   Barr said the crash, which killed former Gulf Power senior vicepresident Jake Horton and two Southern Co. pilots, remains underinvestigation.   Gulf Power admitted a long-running scheme in which the companycontributed to various political campaigns and disguised thepayments through padded invoices from companies that did businesswith the utility, said a government-filed criminal information.   The company blamed most of the illegal activities on Horton.   The government said the contributions were made mainly toFlorida legislative candidates but also included some forpresidential candidates. Contributions went indirectly tothen-Democratic presidential hopefuls Albert Gore, Gary Hart andJohn Glenn, The Atlanta Constitution reported today.   ``We acknowledge with deep regret that federal statutes wereviolated, and we must accept full responsibility for the actions ofa member of our management team,'' said a statement from SouthernCo. President Edward L. Addison and Gulf Power President Douglas L.McCrary.   Horton, 57, died en route to Atlanta after being told he mightbe dismissed because of alleged accounting improprieties uncoveredin a company audit.   Among other things, the government said, Horton pressuredvendors of the utility _ primarily three advertising agencies _ tocontribute to political candidates.   Gulf Power was interested mainly in candidates for president ofthe Florida Senate and speaker of the Florida House because thosepositions have influence in appointing members to the state PublicService Commission, the government documents said.   A panel of Gulf Power executives, including Horton, ``decidedwhich candidates were `good for Gulf Power,''' according to thecriminal information.   Horton and others instructed the vendors to make thecontributions and then submit fraudulent invoices to the utility sothat the vendors could be reimbursed, the information said.   Carter Haynes, a Gulf Power spokesman in Pensacola, said twoother executives named in the agreement as having involvement withHorton in political contributions left the company in the past week.   Ray Yarborough, 62, took early retirement, and Doug Knowles, 42,resigned. Haynes wouldn't say if the departures were related to theguilty plea.   The utility said Gulf Power's management structure has beenreorganized, a comprehensive ethics code for employees has beenadopted and vendors have been told they are not expected to makecontributions as a condition of doing business with the utility.</TEXT></DOC>
