Two systems in particular will come under close scrutiny by the Navy board of inquiry set up Tuesday: the Raytheon Corp. electronic warfare equipment, which is relied on to detect attacks, and the General Dynamics Corp. Phalanx gatling gun, which is designed as a last-ditch defense against incoming missiles.    Navy officials stressed that human error, rather than technological failure, may in the end explain why the Stark wasn't able to counter the surprising, and unintentional, missile attack, which exacted a death toll of 37 U.S. crewmen.    After the stricken frigate was towed into Bahrain, Capt. Glenn Brindel, the ship's skipper, told a press briefing that the electronic warfare equipment, known as AN/SLQ-32, didn't alert him that an Iraqi warplane had launched a sea-skimming missile toward the ship, which was patrolling the southern Persian Gulf. Rather, he said he sighted the missile visually, and managed to switch on the Phalanx system only a second or so before the missile smashed into the hull, setting parts of the frigate ablaze.    Had the Raytheon system signaled the missile launch immediately, the ship may have been able to counter the attack with two on-board defensive systems. One could have sprayed chaff to deflect the incoming weapon from the ship's hull. In addition, the Phalanx gun, once switched onto automatic status, could have fired thousands of projectiles toward the missile.    Navy officials said they haven't determined whether the Raytheon system failed to detect the missile, or whether Navy officials monitoring the equipment failed to notice a warning signal that was emitted. &quot;I don't know whether it's the fault of an operator; I don't know whether it's the fault of the equipment,&quot; Capt. Brindel said.    A Raytheon offical said the electronic warfare system has performed well since the Navy began acquiring it in the late 1970s. &quot;It's on 300 and some ships, and it's had a good record,&quot; the official said.    However, he acknowledged that the Stark's system wouldn't have picked up a missile guided by lasers rather than radar-homing devices. Navy officials say that judging from debris found on the ship, the plane almost certainly fired a radar-guided Exocet missile, but they don't rule out the possiblity that some other type of missile was fired or that a second missile hit the ship.    The Phalanx system itself raises other questions. There aren't any indications that the weapon broke down or didn't work last Sunday. But Navy officials say they aren't comfortable switching the system onto automatic status for long periods for fear it might fire at the wrong targets. &quot;The Phalanx will shoot down what it sees,&quot; said one Navy official. &quot;It isn't able to ask itself the question, is this friendly or hostile?&quot;    For this reason, skippers tend to switch the Phalanx onto automatic status only in dire conditions. By the time the Stark's Phalanx was switched on, it was too late.    A General Dynamics Corp. official said that the Phalanx, which fires off 3,000 rounds a minute, shoots anything that comes within close range of the ship. The official said that the exact range of gun is classified, but conceded that it might fire at a helicopter or low-flying plane, as well as a sea-skimming missile headed for the hull.    Meanwhile, U.S. officials said that two F-15 aircraft being flown on routine patrol by Saudi Arabian pilots in the Gulf region had been asked by American officers to intercept the Iraqi Mirage jet, but weren't able to obtain timely permission from senior Saudi authorities.    The explanation produced some private skepticism at the Pentagon, and the disclosure of the incident is sure to be used by pro-Israel members of Congress as part of their effort to block a proposed sale of 12 to 15 F-15s to Saudi Arabia.    Yesterday, Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) introduced a non-binding resolution to bar the sale of U.S. military equipment to Saudi Arabia until the incident is thoroughly investigated. So far, the administration says it's satisfied with Saudi handling of the matter. But a senior administration official said that the White House may delay giving Congress the required notification of the aircraft sale until it &quot;can get all the facts to the Hill&quot; concerning the request to the Saudis to intercept the Iraqi aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
