Swarns (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MCIC IBM </CO><IN> BBK TEL TNM </IN><TEXT>   MCI Communications Corp., increasingly confident about its financial outlook, will buy back International Business Machines Corp.'s entire 16% stake in the company for $677 million within three weeks.    The timing of the move surprised many analysts, even though MCI had signaled in March its intent to reduce debt and then start buying back the IBM stake. At that time, MCI had said it expected the buy-back to take two to five years.    As part of the arrangement, IBM agreed to acquire two million newly issued shares of MCI preferred for $400 million. The stock, which isn't convertible to common shares, will pay a 7.35% dividend.    The move reflects a growing operating strength at the Washington-based telecommunications concern. By year end, MCI expects to have positive cash flow for the first time in its 20-year history. Buying back the IBM holdings will ease fears of some MCI executives that IBM would end up dominating their company, according to sources close to MCI.    The accelerated schedule for the purchase indicates &quot;our confidence in the company and its future,&quot; said Daniel F. Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer. The company's improved performance and outlook suggested that its stock price might go up, making the timing attractive, he said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI common stock rose 75 cents to close at $16.125 a share. IBM stock fell 50 cents to close at $124.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Mr. Akerson said MCI will pay only about $14.40 a share for the IBM holdings and that the transaction will leave MCI with about $250 million of cash on hand. He declined to provide more details about the mechanics of the transaction.    Analysts estimated MCI's ratio of debt to total capital will rise to about 70% from 65%. The new preferred stock held by IBM will cost MCI about $30 million a year in dividends.    Mr. Akerson also predicted that the transaction would have a positive impact on MCI's 1988 earnings, but he didn't make a specific forecast. Last year, MCI earned $88 million, or 31 cents a share, on revenue of $3.94 billion.    The company said it doesn't have immediate plans for the 47 million common shares being bought back from IBM. Mr. Akerson noted, however, that the shares do &quot;provide future flexibility in terms of financing.&quot;    IBM acquired the stake in 1986 as part of its sale of Satellite Business Systems to MCI. While IBM agreed not to buy more than 30% of the company's shares, some MCI executives still worried that IBM could end up dominating MCI. In March, the company called the buy-back a top priority.    Mr. Akerson said MCI never &quot;felt threatened&quot; by IBM. He said the two companies will continue their &quot;viable, robust relationship,&quot; with cooperative marketing arrangements and joint technical ventures.    Meanwhile, Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM is expected to record a pretax gain of about $150 million on the sale in the third quarter, even though MCI stock had fallen so much that it seemed for a long time that IBM would take a loss on the investment.    Around the time IBM acquired the MCI shares, there was a great deal of talk that the alliance would lead to an increased push by IBM into telecommunications, but IBM has been backtracking for some time now. It remains interested in making telecommunications equipment and producing software that will help companies manage their networks of telephones and computers, but IBM has been making it clear that it views the common carriers as being in a separate business.    IBM -- which failed to make a go of Satellite Business Systems, a transmitter of information via satellite -- has also made it clear that it doesn't care to be in businesses regulated by the government.    ---   Paul B.
