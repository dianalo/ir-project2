The new policies, taken together, are beginning to reduce theindustry's profitability to the point that contractors will not beable to attract new investors, nor will they be able to sustaintheir private research efforts, the study says.   That, in turn, is going to ``slow the rate of technologicalgrowth and result in a loss of (U.S.) technological leadership,''the study adds.   ``Our findings should concern those in the Congress and DoD whobelieve that a strong, research-and-development andinvestment-oriented defense industry is a key factor in maintainingthe United States' military strength,'' the authors wrote.   The study, entitled ``The Impact on Defense IndustrialCapability of Changes in Procurement and Tax Policy, 1984-1987,''was released by the Aerospace Industries Association, theElectronic Industries Association and the National SecurityIndustrial Association.   The research was funded by the three associations but performedindependently by The MAC Group, a management consulting firm basedin Cambridge, Mass.   The three associations asked the consultant to analyze thecombined impact of a number of recent changes in the defenseprocurement world, ranging from an end to certain tax deferralbenefits; a reduction in profit markup allowances; a cut in thepercentage of money paid out monthly for work in progress, andrequirements that industry pay for more of the upfront costs ofresearch and development.   Those changes were all enacted or promulgated during the periodfrom 1984 to 1987 ``and were introduced in a piecemeal fashion,''the study found.   ``We find no evidence that the combined impact of the changeswas studied by the Congress or the Department of Defense,'' it said.   While the effects of the changes may be absorbed on anindividual basis, the combined impact is devastating, the studysaid.   To demonstrate, the authors collected actual data from ninecontractors on nine large weapons programs and then applied thevarious tax and contracting changes as if they had been in effectfrom the start of the programs.   ``The return on investment on the programs analyzed would havebeen less than the return necessary to preserve shareholdervalue,'' the report stated.   ``Put simply, there would have been no financial reason to bidthe programs. Profits will be substantially reduced _ by an averageof 23 percent on the companies' defense business.''   As a result of slower cash flows and lower profits, defensecontractors are almost assuredly going to have to begin borrowingheavily, the report continued.   Using the case studies, ``the additional financing required tofill the gap caused by the changes _ $8.5 billion _ is equivalentto 50 percent of the total 1985 equity of the companies in ourstudy.''   The industry is unlikely to be able to raise that kind of money,meaning it will have to slow plant modernization and curtailprivate research.   ``Competition will be reduced because there will be fewercompetitors willing to bid on future programs. And a financiallyweakened industry will be less able to compete against growing, andsometimes subsidized, foreign competition.''   Congress and the Pentagon might not like it, but the only realanswer is to restore to contractors some of the profitability theyhave lost when performing defense work, the study concluded.   ``Equally important, the Congress should ensure that the type ofuncoordinated policy change that led to this unintended outcome isnot repeated,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
