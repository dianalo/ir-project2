CarrollStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> IBM ASTA INTC LOTS UISCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> LAS VEGAS, Nev.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wall Street's jitters haven't put a damper on the personal computer industry, which is throwing itself a $200 million, weeklong party here to celebrate its expectations for a bright future.    Some 90,000 people have taken over the city for the annual fall Comdex show, according to organizers -- a turnout so large that Las Vegas ran out of hotel space long ago. Attendees are commuting daily from Los Angeles, San Jose and other West Coast cities; dozens are camping out in recreational vehicles.    The products on display here have convinced participants that the industry will maintain this year's 30% to 35% growth rate for at least a few months even if the rest of the economy falters. Various products have supplied some of the missing pieces for International Business Machines Corp.'s new line of personal computers. A new generation of laptop computers is on view, and an intriguing new type of software is being introduced.    Steve Malisewski, vice president for marketing at MicroAge Computer Stores Inc., a large chain, says of the stock market crash, &quot;At this point, we've seen the flash of light from the nuclear explosion, but we haven't felt the shock waves yet.&quot; He adds, &quot;All our clients are saying that if this is affecting anyone it must be affecting someone else.&quot;    It certainly isn't affecting the party plans at the trade show. &quot;Comdex is like Hollywood on steroids,&quot; says Marty Winston, a marketing consultant and longtime attendee. &quot;And this year won't be any different despite the stock-market crash.&quot; IDG Communications, the biggest publisher of computer trade magazines, last night threw a party for 4,000 of its closest friends. The Temptations performed, and guests were offered helicopter rides so they could get a better view of all the neon here.    Certainly, some of the newly wealthy entrepreneurs have been swapping horror stories around the bowls of shrimp, and many companies are sounding out their customers to see if their markets will weaken. But after a spectacular year of recovery following a 1 1/2-year downturn, the industry hasn't yet shown any signs of weakness, executives say.    Executives say personal-computer purchases traditionally don't get caught up in capital-spending budgets -- which get cut quickly in an economic downturn -- but depend instead on whether customers believe the computers improve productivity. And the officials say the products on display here are important enough that the industry should continue to ride the wave that formed earlier this year after IBM, Apple Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp., among others, unveiled new computers.    Much of the reason for the optimism stems from the appearance of products that will help IBM's new computers, which analysts say haven't yet regained market share. AST Research Inc. and Quadram Corp. are showing add-on products that will increase the machines' main memory, letting them run larger and more complex software programs. In addition, several companies' products will let the machines run on more types of networks.    Some video adapters enable the IBM computers to produce a higher-resolution image than IBM's adapter allows. A few companies, such as Core International, have produced hard-disk drives that hold more memory and work faster than IBM's drives, which have perhaps been the most-criticized part of the machines. And numerous companies have produced circuit cards that let the personal computers talk to mainframes.    IBM itself is expected to announce this morning that it will soon ship OS/2, the long-awaited operating system that will allow for new types of software on the new machines from IBM and its competitors. But the competitors insist their machines will run the various versions of OS/2 at least as well.    The market for laptop computers, though newer and far smaller, also is generating considerable interest at the show because it will double this year and is expected to stay robust. Most companies are demonstrating the next generation of battery-powered machine, based on the Intel Corp. chip that provides the heart of the IBM AT. Some even use the 80386 chip, which is the most powerful now available in the IBM-compatible world; many are showing better hard-disk memories and more readable screens, and are lighter and less expensive.    At least as intriguing is the type of software product that Lotus Development Corp. introduced yesterday, although the benefits are less obvious than the laptop developments. The product, a cousin of the Hypercard, which Apple recently introduced for its Macintosh, allows users to retrieve information from a data base far more flexibly than is now possible.    ---   Unisys Unveils New Line   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Unisys Corp. introduced a line of personal computers that brings it up to date with competitors and gives it a basis for expansion in this field.    Unisys, which says it will sell more than $400 million in personal computers this year, introduced machines based on Intel's 80286 and 80386 chips, giving it products comparable in power to the high-end products of IBM and Compaq.    Unisys was playing catch-up, but it said the hardware products ensure that its personal computer business will continue to grow rapidly because of software that gives the machines the ability to hook into a wide variety of computer networks and to communicate easily with bigger Unisys computers.    The machines will appeal almost exclusively to customers who need them as part of large Unisys systems, and are an effort to prevent competitors from making inroads with Unisys customers.    Although the company doesn't sell the machines as stand-alone products, it said the business will grow 25% to 30% this year, in line with the personal-computer industry as a whole, and will grow more than 50% next year. </TEXT></DOC>
