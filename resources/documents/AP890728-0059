Jaruzelski, the party chief, opened a crucial session of theCentral Committee that is expected to result in a new leader forthe first time in eight years and perhaps lead to fundamentalchanges in the party itself.   Later in the meeting, Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka,considered a candidate to become prime minister and a critic ofoutgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, gave up his dutiesas the party leader in charge of the economy. There was noimmediate explanation.   The scheduled two-day meeting comes a month after the candidatesbacked by the newly legalized Solidarity trade union movementcaptured 260 out of 261 seats they contested in the parliamentaryelections.   Jaruzelski, who opened the meeting by thanking the party forhelping to elect him president July 19, was expected to resign fromthe party leadership post he had held since 1981 in order to devotehimself to the new office.   He told the meeting that it ould be ``one of the mostimportant'' meetings since the last party congress in 1986, thestate's PAP news service reported.   Jaruzelski challenged the Central Committee to decide: ``What asa party do we stand for? What should we defend against? What do wefight for? And what tasks should we begin in pursuit of socialsupport?''   The party also heard reports on the nation's poor economicsituation by Baka, assessing the election results by Politburomember Janusz Reykowski and on the probles and future of the partyby Politburo member Marian Orzechowski.   State radio reported that Baka at the end of his speech quit aseconomic secretary for the Central Committee. The resignation couldbe to free him to take the prime minister's job, or it couldindicate that he has lost out in a power struggle with Rakowski.   In his speech, Baka had pointedly criticized Rakowski'sgovernment as lacking ``stubbornness and consistency'' in itshandling of the economy.   Reykowski expressed hope that the elections will have a``curative effect on the party'' and spur it to change its ways offunctioning ``as soon as possible,'' PAP reported.   ``Most of society has had enough of the party as it has been.Secondly, a significant part of the party grass roots has hadenough of the style and ways of functioning of the partyleadership,'' Orzechowski said, according to PAP.   Going into today's meeting, some party members said the230-member Central Committee may call for a party congress, thefirst in three years, to consider dissolving the 2 million-memberparty and forming new groupings on the left.   The party also was expected to be consulted on Jaruzelski'schoice to succeed Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who hassubmitted his resignation as premier but is believed interested insucceeding Jaruzelski as first secretary.   On Thursday, one unidentified regional official quoted by stateradio said the party congress, considered for later this year,``should be the last congress in the history of the (party). Ithink that new parties should be created where everyone would beable to find a place for himself.''   After the party's June thrashing in the parliamentary elections_ the freest in 40 years _ a Central Committee official toldreporters: ``This Polish party cannot win elections. This CommunistParty will not win elections.'' The official, speaking on conditionof anonymity, suggested that radical reforms were necessary.   Splitting the party into a leftist or social democratic partyand a more orthodox Communist Party appeared to be favored byreformists in the party close to Jaruzelski. But Rakowski hasopposed such division.   Rakowski argues that a united Communist Party should protectliving standards and win support by appealing to economic issues.   Jaruzelski, 66, was appointed party first secretary in October1981 and ordered martial law two months later to crush Solidarity.But this year, in an effort to pull the nation out of its economiccrisis, he urged party leaders to legalize the trade union andushered in Poland's first free elections in more than four decades.   He has promised Solidarity lawmakers that he would leave hisparty position if elected president, but he did not specify when.   On July 19, he was elected president by the National Assemblywith the minimum majority, thanks to passive support from a handfulof Solidarity legislators.   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak or party ideologist MarianOrzechowski also are considered in the running for party leader,assuming Jaruzelski does resign at the Central Committee meeting.   Jaruzelski had been urging that the next government be a ``grandcoalition'' that would include Solidarity.   But Solidarity leader Lech Walesa rejected the offer Tuesday andsaid if the opposition would not be allowed to form the wholegovernment, then it would stay entirely in the opposition.</TEXT></DOC>
