Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., a 24-year-old former junior analystwith the venerable firm Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., pleaded guiltyWednesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to the first criminalcharges leveled in the case.   Wang, who was free on a $250,000 personal recognizance bond,also agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge in connection witha separate, previously undisclosed insider trading scheme heallegedly undertook when he first began working for Morgan Stanleyin June 1986.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who outlined the charges at anews conference, said Wang was cooperating with the government andthat the investigation was continuing, an indication that othersmay be charged.   U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy set sentencing for Oct. 19. Wangfaces a maximum punishment of 15 years in prison and $750,000 infines for the three fraud counts against him.   The charges were the first criminal counts made in the scandalfirst dicslosed in late June in a civil complaint by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission.   Prosecutors charged Wang with using his position at MorganStanley to steal market-sensitive information about pendingtakeovers and other confidential matters in which the firm played arole.   The government alleged Wang peddled the information starting inJune 1987 to a Taiwanese businessman, Fred C. Lee, who allegedlyused it to make at least $19 million in profitable stock trades inmore than 14 companies and shared about $200,000 with Wang.   Lee was named as an unindicted co-conspirator, but Giulianideclined to explain why Lee was not charged. Federal officials saidLee, also known by his Chinese name Chwan Hong Lee, was in Taiwan.   The SEC has frozen the U.S.-based assets of both men andrequested return of the $19 million plus triple penalties for atotal of $76 million.   That amount makes the case the second-biggest insider tradingscheme next to the record $100 million in illicit profits andpenalties surrendered by now-imprisoned Wall Street speculator IvanBoesky nearly two years ago.   The Wang case is considered significant not only because of theamount of money involved, but because the alleged abuses came atthe height of a public uproar over Wall Street greed and corruptionhighlighted by the Boesky scandal. It suggested that insidertrading remains a deep-rooted problem.   Giuliani said Morgan Stanley cooperated in the government'sinvestigation and faces no criminal liability, but also indicatedthe firm should have done more to detect Wang's activities, whichthe former analyst allegedly undertook during much of hisinternship.   Morgan Stanley spokesman Peter Roche did not return telephonecalls for comment on Wednesday. The firm fired Wang after thescandal first was disclosed and has stated it believed adequateprecautions were taken.   Lee's lawyer James Morton, at the Pittsburgh firm BuchananIngersoll PC, said in a telephone interview that the criminalcharges against Wang were news to him. He declined to comment onany aspect of the case or his client.   Giuliani said the separate, previously undisclosed insidertrading scheme involving Wang included an unidentified personliving in the Chicago area, where Wang grew up. Giuliani said theperson was not a Wang relative or engaged in the financialbusiness, but declined to elaborate.   In that scheme, Giuliani said, Wang fed market-sensitive tipsabout developments in at least five companies to the otherindividual, who used the information to make profitable trades andrewarded Wang with about $4,000.   Wang, who attended the University of Illinois atChampaign-Urbana, won a coveted internship at Morgan Stanley beforehe graduated and was only days short of completing it when the SECbrought its civil complaint.</TEXT></DOC>
