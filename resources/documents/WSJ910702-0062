Keating Jr.'s AmericanContinental Corp., are expected today to call Mr. Keating totestify.   The agency is seeking to recover the money and to ban Mr.Keating and six of his former associates from the savings andloan industry. In all, more than 100 proposed witnesses havebeen listed for the hearing, including Edwin Gray, formerFederal Home Loan Bank Board chairman, and L. WilliamSeidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. An OTS rulingagainst the former chairman of Phoenix, Ariz.-based AmericanContinental, who was indicted last year on California chargesrelated to the sale of bonds, could be used to buttresscertain fraud claims by plaintiffs in other civil actions,their lawyers said.</LP><TEXT>   The OTS inquiry, expected to continue at least two weeks,will focus on losses to American Continental's former unit,Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association. The federal governmenthas alleged in a civil suit that the California thrift wasused by Mr. Keating and the others as a cash cow for theirpersonal gain.   If Mr. Keating pleads the Fifth Amendment and declines totestify, as is expected, the OTS proceedings would havelittle if any impact on any subsequent criminal actionsagainst him. However, by law in civil proceedings, a judgemay permit negative inferences to be drawn from a refusal totestify.   Transactions at issue in the OTS administrative hearingare said to be significant elements in a two-year federalgrand jury investigation into Lincoln's collapse.   These transactions include the financing of Detroit'sHotel Ponchartrain, which resulted in a loss to Lincoln of$24.2 million, and $12.3 million in allegedly improperfunding by Lincoln of an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Thelargest element of the OTS case arises from a $94 millionloss to Lincoln allegedly caused by the upstreaming ofunjustified tax payments to American Continental.   The government contends that paper profits were createdfor Lincoln from such deals as a financing of the HiddenValley Ranch, a tract of land that was allegedly purchased atheavily inflated prices by Arizona businessman Ernest Garcia,through a straw buyer. Mr. Garcia, a Tucson developer, haspleaded guilty to a charge of fraudulently obtaining a lineof credit from Lincoln, and is said to be cooperating withfederal prosecutors.   Lincoln was seized in April 1989, one day after its parentfiled for protection from creditors under bankruptcy law. Thebailout of Lincoln, which has since been acquired by GreatWestern Savings, Beverly Hills, is expected to cost taxpayers$2.6 billion, making it the most expensive thrift failure inhistory.   Mr. Keating has maintained his innocence, repeatedlyclaiming that his activities had been sanctioned initially bythe California state and federal governments, and thatregulators themselves were responsible for most of AmericanContinental's problems.   At yesterday's opening hearings, marked by heatedexchanges between lawyers, Mr. Keating sat impassively in thefirst row of the courtroom between his son, Charles KeatingIII, and son-in-law Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr. Both theyounger Mr. Keating and Mr. Wurzelbacher, as former AmericanContinental officials, were subpoenaed by the OTS to testify.   Defense lawyers have criticized the OTS proceedings as animpediment to their trial preparations for pending andanticipated criminal charges. At the hearing, AdministrativeLaw Judge Paul Clerman denied a motion by Stephen C. Neal,the lead lawyer for Mr. Keating, to discontinue or delay theOTS action. Mr. Keating and the others claim to be insolventand incapable of reimbursement.   &quot;Is it really so important that all this time and taxpayermoney is wasted so that the government can call my client a'savings and loan nogoodnik'?&quot; said Abbe David Lowell, anattorney for former American Continental President Judy J.Wischer. Ms. Wischer has been notified by prosecutors thatshe is a target of their criminal investigation, Mr. Lowellsaid.   The criminal charges in California against Mr. Keating,Ms. Wischer and two former Lincoln officials stem fromalleged misrepresentations about the value of AmericanContinental bonds sold at Lincoln offices.   In addition, Mr. Keating stands at the heart of a massivefederal civil case in Phoenix, in which thousands ofbondholders are seeking more than $250 million. That case hasbeen consolidated with a $1.7 billion civil fraud andracketeering lawsuit by the Resolution Trust Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
