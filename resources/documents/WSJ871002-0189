SmithStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><CO> SO GPE+ </CO><IN> UTILITIES (UTI)NUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK) </IN><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Southern Co. said it will take an after-tax charge of $226 million by next Jan. 31 to reflect an increase in the cost of building the Vogtle nuclear power plant.    The utility holding company is taking the charge because construction costs have exceeded a self-imposed limit beyond which costs are passed along to shareholders rather than to customers. It said it hasn't yet decided in which period it will take the charge, but that it will do so no later than next January, when a new accounting rule takes effect.    Southern Co. had fourth-quarter net income of $181.3 million, or 64 cents a share, on revenue of $1.6 billion. For 1986, net income was $883 million, or $3.17 a share, on revenue of $6.85 billion.    &quot;This write-off will significantly erode the company's financial results in the short term,&quot; Edward L. Addison, president, said. &quot;But in and of itself the write-off will not prevent us from maintaining the dividend we're paying to our stockholders.&quot;    Even though the charge could wipe out a full quarter's earnings, Wall Street reacted calmly to the news.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Southern Co.'s shares closed at $26.50, down 50 cents, on a day when utility stocks generally traded lower.    &quot;Most people knew they (Southern Co.) were over budget,&quot; said Warren Spitz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;The $226 million was a little bit above expectations, but not a whole lot.&quot;    Barry Abramson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., pointed out that the planned write-off &quot;is barely 1% of assets.&quot; He added that something like this had been expected because of the new accounting rule, adopted recently by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It requires any costs determined to be nonrecoverable to be charged against earnings once that determination is made.    Southern Co. last year pledged not to pass through to ratepayers more than $3.56 billion -- which was then its share of the $8.35 billion estimated total cost of the plant. It said any amount above that cap would be charged to its shareholders.    Yesterday the company said a new review puts the cost of the project at $8.87 billion. The $522 million increase was caused by additional labor costs incurred to keep Unit 1 on schedule for commercial operation next summer and by a delay in the expected completion of Unit 2, Southern Co. said. Southern Co.'s portion of the increase will result in the $226 million charge.    Further increases could be passed along to shareholders before construction is completed. Mr. Abramson observed that &quot;each time you review the construction cost of a nuclear plant it goes up.&quot; A Southern Co. spokesman said &quot;the key to whether or not the Vogtle construction budget goes up any more will be the company's ability to complete Unit 2 on time.&quot; Unit 2 now is scheduled for completion in June 1989.    Southern Co., through its Georgia Power Co. subsidiary, owns 45.7% of the Vogtle plant, which is in Burke County, Ga. Smaller stakes are held by two electricity cooperatives and the city of Dalton, Ga. </TEXT></DOC>
