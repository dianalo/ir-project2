The students from Chungang University fought running battles withpolice for 40 minutes in front of the Seoul school. They also burnedan effigy of President Roh Tae-woo before dispersing.   ``Punish Chun Doo-hwan and oust Roh Tae-woo!'' the studentsshouted.   Chun Doo-hwan, Roh's predecessor, stepped down last February andis under acute criticism for corruption and misdeeds during hisseven-year administration.   The United National Democratic Movement, an umbrella organizationfor more than 200 dissident groups, said it is planning majoranti-American rallies on Monday, when Bush comes for a five-hourvisit.   Bush arrived today in Tokyo for Emperor Hirohito's funeral and isscheduled to stop in Seoul en route to Washington after visitingChina. In Seoul, he will meet with Roh and deliver a speech to theNational Assembly.   Police were expected to enforce tight security as radical groupsannounced plans to use the occasions to promote theiranti-government and anti-U.S. causes.   Today's clash followed Roh's warning that he would not toleratefurther acts of violence in order to ``establish law and order atany cost.''   In a meeting with governing party officials, he reaffirmed agovernment plan to clamp down on the protests beginning this weekend.   Roh warned that radical groups are trying to overthrow thegovernment through revolutionary means. He said the government andsociety must be prepared to fight the radicals.   The warning, Roh's second in less than two weeks, came as thenation's largest dissident organization prepared nationwide protestrallies on Saturday, the first anniversary of Roh's presidentialinauguration.   Last weekend, police mobilized 24,000 trooops to thwart two majoranti-government rallies in Seoul and detained 2,500 workers andstudents. They said demonstrations by students, farmers, workers anddissidents were banned.   On the day Bush arrives, dissidents said they would defy stagemajor anti-American demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy andmilitary installations in Seoul and other parts of the country.   In the southern city of Kwangju today, police formally chargedtwo radical students with arson for allegedly setting fire to aprovincial governor's residence with firebombs.   Police said they were looking for 23 more students believed tohave taken part in the burning Wednesday. Nobody was hurt in theattack.   The radical blame the United States for the continued division ofthe Korean peninsula and want the 42,000 American troops stationedin their country under a mutual defense treaty to be removed.</TEXT></DOC>
