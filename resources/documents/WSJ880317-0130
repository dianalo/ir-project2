Now the gap is closing. The outlook: more pain and disruption at home and abroad.    Sure, the trade deficit symbolizes a profligate America, consuming more than it produces and spending more than it has. But it also represents the biggest gravy train ever for U.S. trading partners, who have been selling America all that stuff and lending the money to pay for it.    Suddenly reality is sinking in. If, as many think possible, America's trade books are finally brought into balance over the next five years, the train will stop. Other countries will be forced into a stunning $200 billion trade turnaround. That's how much more they will be buying from America and how much less they will be selling the U.S. or collecting in interest payments.    &quot;After years of shouting for a quick fix, the world is staring the implications of this right in the face,&quot; says an international monetary official.    Those implications may have been obvious to economists. Still, they aren't going to be welcome. &quot;Every one of our trading partners is going to feel real pain,&quot; promises Robert D. Hormats, a director of Goldman Sachs International Corp. in New York. So will the U.S. Affordable imports will disappear, and more production will go for export instead of home use.    There's little doubt that an unwinding of the mammoth trade deficit, the gap between U.S. imports and exports, has begun. The major reason is the low value of the dollar against the currencies of most trading partners; this makes U.S. goods cheaper abroad and foreign goods more expensive in America.    U.S. trade figures for January, to be released today, are expected to show that the one-month trade gap widened a little from the surprisingly small $12.2 billion deficit in December, because of a seasonal drop in U.S. farm sales abroad. The figures aren't adjusted for seasonal factors, inflation, or the changing value of currencies.    More important, they should show a continuing surge in American manufactured exports. These exports rose 17% by volume in all of last year, and 25% in the fourth quarter. &quot;We have an export bonanza under way,&quot; boasts Beryl Sprinkel, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. He says exports could rise another 17% this year, or by about $45 billion.    Wiping out last year's record $171 billion trade deficit will mean swift, powerful and notably uneven changes for America's trading partners -- bigger, for instance, than the adjustment to the two oil price rises of the 1970s.    The four emerging &quot;tigers&quot; of Asia -- South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore -- could face a $20 billion swing in trade with the U.S., slowing their export-led development. Lesser-developed countries may be forced into a $15 billion adjustment and Eastern Europe perhaps a $5 billion change. The remaining $160 billion will be divided between Japan and Western Europe, and many people figure Europe will feel its hit the hardest.    &quot;We have all, in Europe and Japan and Asia, expanded on the shoulders of U.S. consumers during the last five years. Now it's our turn to suffer,&quot; says Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co.    He figures that the coming overhaul of who sells what to whom &quot;will cost four million jobs around the world.&quot; The losses will come as companies -- primarily European and Japanese -- have to cut back because they are less able to compete with lower-priced U.S. goods in world markets and less able to sell as much to the U.S.    The U.S. deficits &quot;have distorted everybody's economies,&quot; explains Richard N. Cooper, Harvard University professor of international economics. &quot;We've squeezed our manufacturing and farm sectors, giving European, Japanese and Asian exporters a boost. Now Europe, Japan and Asia are going to get squeezed as the U.S. manufacturing sector comes back.&quot; He adds: &quot;We've got built into today's exchange rates a much faster improvement in the trade deficit than anybody has accounted for.&quot;    The U.S. itself won't escape unscathed. Consumers, spoiled by low-priced imports, will now have to pay more for them. Workers may have to work a bit harder for less money so their products can compete on world markets. The downside of more exports is &quot;an inevitable reduction in U.S. living standards,&quot; says Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs. &quot;We will be sacrificing our living standards for a long time because we are paying off our debts with real goods.&quot;    So far, the model for adjustment is Japan, the biggest beneficiary of the U.S. deficit. It has already started reducing exports and increasing imports. Trade surpluses have dropped in each of the past 10 months. It still has a way to go; even after buying 52% more from America in February, its surplus with the U.S. was $3.4 billion.    Nonetheless, &quot;Japan is in good odor,&quot; says a U.S. official. It pushes domestic consumption and is refocusing industries in a way Europe either can't or won't. &quot;The Japanese,&quot; says J. Paul Horne, European economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in Paris, &quot;seem to have an unlimited capacity for pain.&quot;    The emerging industrial giants of Asia will have to live with slower sales to the U.S., though they may have to be pushed by American protectionist measures aimed at keeping their products out.    Political and economic pressure may also persuade South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore to open their markets to avoid U.S. retaliation, and to let their currencies rise against the dollar as Japan has done. These four countries together last year sold the U.S. $37.7 billion more goods than they bought. Less-developed countries in Latin and South America and Africa aren't such an issue: They might like to buy more from the U.S. but are being restrained by their debt burdens.    That leaves Europe. &quot;Europe is going to have a very bad time this year,&quot; predicts David Lomax, chief economist for National Westminster Bank in London.    After failing to create jobs when a strong dollar was fostering America's trade deficit, Europe stands to lose even some of what it had now that the imbalance is unwinding. Worse, it starts from 11% unemployment. &quot;I'm afraid that the most difficult part of their adjustment over the next five years will be an even bigger squeeze on jobs,&quot; says Mr. Hormats.    The profits European exporters made selling to the U.S. went mainly into more-efficient machines and higher wages for their employees, not into new factories or services. During the decade before the dollar peaked in 1985, Europe created no new net jobs, while the U.S. created 18 million, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. This trend has continued and will probably accelerate, the OECD says.    The job cutbacks have already begun. Last month, Dutch electronics giant NV Philips said it would slash 20,000 jobs this year and move or close 80 of its 200 European factories during the next five years. Porsche AG will cut output 39% in the model year ending next July 31 and put as many as 6,100 of its 8,500 employees on short workweeks. The stock-market crash, in addition to the rising value of the German mark, has hurt U.S. sales of its high-priced sports cars.    To make matters worse, American manufacturers now are selling hard in Europe. One of the most prominent exhibitors at the Geneva Automobile show earlier this month was Chrysler Corp., which hopes to recruit 335 European dealers and sell up to 25,000 cars and Jeeps in Europe in 1988.    The magnitude of the change that is coming, and the political problems posed by something like closing a steel mill that can no longer compete, has thrust Europeans into a paradoxical position. They once decried the strong dollar and the rising U.S. trade deficit. Now some caution America that speed is everything -- the slower the better.    &quot;If the U.S. trade deficit collapsed tomorrow, it would be a catastrophe for Europe,&quot; says Michel Develle, chief economist for Banque Paribas in Paris. A gradual fall would buy time, yet, they hope, damp pressure for protectionism in Congress and among presidential candidates.    Stretching out the pain could also avoid a U.S. recession. Such a slump would chop the trade deficit by cutting U.S. imports drastically, but it would also mean even worse trouble for foreign companies that sell in the U.S. Some experts warn that if adjustments aren't worked out, a recession could become the automatic remedy for the U.S. trade gap.    Fear of a recession nags many Europeans so much that they have stopped calling for higher taxes to cut the U.S. budget deficit. That deficit is regularly blamed for helping fuel America's excessive imports. &quot;The last thing we need is some silly ass coming into the White House, raising taxes by $50 billion and causing a world-wide recession,&quot; adds Mr. Lomax.    Reagan administration officials contend that the only way out of the problems they created by running these twin deficits is more growth in Europe and the U.S.; this would absorb more American goods. U.S. officials now have the unwinding trade deficit at the top of the list of reasons why West Germany should raise demand at home by tax and interest-rate cuts.    &quot;Faster German growth alone won't solve the U.S. trade deficit problem, but it is the key to faster European growth, and that would help a whole lot,&quot; says a U.S. official who regularly meets with European policy makers. &quot;The alternatives are an even lower dollar, a deep recession, or both. We are trying to explain this without scaring the heck out of them.&quot;    Europe's problem is one of history confronting simple mathematics. In order to absorb their &quot;share&quot; of the deficit reversal, proud companies built on exports may have to change tack, fast. &quot;Are they going to do it?&quot; asks Mr. Cooper of Harvard. &quot;My answer is no. I can't see the Germans and the Dutch, whose very psyche is tied up with exporting, tolerating a $75 billion or $80 billion swing in their exports.&quot;    But not tolerating such a swing would require a big expansion of Europe's economy, so that exports previously aimed at the U.S. could be redirected within Europe. This isn't likely. Unlike Japan, most of Western Europe already has a highly developed system of roadways, and a large number of European consumers already have as many cars and videocassette recorders as they need.    Even a gradual reduction of $15 billion to $20 billion a year in the U.S. trade deficit will mean big changes in Europe. &quot;To get even this reduction in the deficit, we're probably facing a choice between a U.S. recession and an even lower dollar,&quot; says Mr. Develle of Paribas. &quot;Between the two, Europe would take the lower dollar. That means a long, slow painful exit, but it's the only way out.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
