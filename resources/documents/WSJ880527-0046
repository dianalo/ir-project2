According to an annual survey taken by the Food Marketing Institute, people 18 to 24 years old have now upped their spending on groceries to $63 a week, from $54 a year ago, while people 65 and older increased theirs to $55 a week, from $47.    Meanwhile, all other age groups are spending about what they did last year: those 25 to 39 years old, $73; those 40 to 49, $91; and those 50 to 64, $67. Even the average weekly amount that all shoppers spend on food has remained fairly flat, at about $71.    Still, shoppers age 40 to 49 spend more at the supermarket than any other age group. So even though their spending isn't increasing, they remain the prime target of food marketers.    That is likely to remain true well into the future. The reason: The baby boom generation (now age 24 to 42) is just beginning to enter the ranks of the 40 to 49-year-olds; by 1998, that age group will have grown to 40 million people from 29 million people, up 37%. That is nearly five times the projected growth rate of the total population.    The Food Marketing Institute's survey reflects only what an individual shopper spends and doesn't take into account the number of people the groceries feed. Thus, one reason younger shoppers may report spending more is that they are buying groceries for more people. According to the Census Bureau, young adults are increasingly choosing to live at home rather than on their own. They may be out shopping both for themselves and for their parents.    U.S. Youth Will Continue   To Follow the Sun   DURING THE 1990s, the West will be as popular as ever, especially among the young.    Between 1990 and 2000, the population of the U.S. is expected to grow 7.1%. But growth in the Western region is projected to be nearly twice that, 13.7%, the largest of any region.    Many of those residents will be under age 18, according to new projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. That age group is expected to grow 8.2% in the West during the decade -- more than three times the nationwide projection of 2.6% and, once again, more than any other region.    The big loser in the under-age-18 population parade? The Northeast. It will probably grow by less than 1%, with an overall growth rate of just 2.4%.    According to the Census Bureau, the Northeast also will have the lowest proportion of its population under age 18, while the West will have the highest. At the same time, the Northeast will have the greatest proportion of its population over age 65, and the West the lowest.    Charting the Changes   In the Family Budget   CONSUMER SPENDING for cars and trucks jumped more than 90% between 1980 and 1986. But transportation expenses as a percent of a household's total budget barely budged over the six year period: They are up only one-tenth of a percentage point, to 21.2%, according to the most recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is because decreased spending in other areas of the transportation category offset the spending rise for vehicles. Gasoline and oil expenses, for example, were down 24% over the period.    Some categories, however, did show marked overall increases. Housing expenditures grew to 30.3% of a 1986 budget, from 28.7% in 1980, primarily because of a 58% increase in the cost of a home. And the insurance and pensions category rose to take nearly 10% of the total budget, from 7.2% in 1980, reflecting higher Social Security taxes and rising insurance premiums.    The budget percentages for clothing and &quot;other&quot; (which includes entertainment and personal care expenses) remained fairly constant over the six year period. Only one category fell: Continuing a long-term trend, the percentage spent on food declined to 14.8% from 19.3%.    ---                      Spending Patterns   Consumer spending, by the category, 1986 Housing ........................................ 30.3% Transportation ................................. 21.2% Food ........................................... 14.8% Other .......................................... 14.5% Insurance ....................................... 9.4% Apparel ......................................... 5.1% Health Care ..................................... 4.7%   ---   Where the Jobs Are   Isn't Where the Money Is   HIGH GROWTH in regional employment does not necessarily mean a high household income.   Between 1980 and 1986, the Midwest had a net gain of 774,000 jobs; the Northeast, 1.9 million; and the West, 2.4 million, according to the Conference Board, a business trade organization. The South, however, tacked on nearly 4 million new jobs.   Even so, in 1986, household income in the South averaged $36,000 annually, trailing every other region. In the Midwest, households averaged $39,000 annually; in the West, $42,000; and in the Northeast, $45,000.   The South's lower average may be due in part to the number of low paying jobs within the region. Eight million people, for example, work in wholesale and retail trade. Conversely, only 4.8 million people hold such jobs in the Northeast.   ---   Compiled by the staff of American Demographics magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
