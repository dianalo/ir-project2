U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said Miss Gabor's attorneyscan refile the complaint once they fix its flaws.   Miss Gabor sued alleging negligence, defamation and assault andbattery after she was removed from Flight 462 while stopping inAtlanta en route from Los Angeles to West Palm Beach on Jan. 6,1989.   A flight attendant and the pilot asked their first-classpassenger to put her dogs Genghis Kahn and Macho Man in hercarry-on kennel, but she refused.   ``You know Zsa Zsa. She'll speak her mind,'' said her lawyer,Donald Norton. ``She told the stewardess what she thought of her.''   Norton said only one dog was loose and that the argument wasover Miss Gabor's refusal to put a jewel-filled Gucci bag in anoverhead compartment.   In Atlanta, a Delta vice president boarded the Boeing 767 to askagain, but the airline said she rejected the requests with``considerable vulgarity'' and was escorted off the flight by apolice officer.   The incident occurred before Miss Gabor's celebrated run-in witha Beverly Hills motorcycle officer on June 14. She is appealing athree-day jail sentence; and the officer is suing her for $10million, charging slander, emotional distress and assault andbattery.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Teen-age actor Corey Feldman was arrested foralleged heroin possession after several balloons containing thedrug were found in his car, police said.
