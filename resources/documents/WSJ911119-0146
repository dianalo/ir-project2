Butterflies are fluttering. And thecoke ovens are belching cyanide and sulfur into the air.   USX Corp.'s U.S. Steel Group has set aside 60 acres ofland at its Clairton, Pa., coke plant as a &quot;wildlife habitat&quot;-- complete with a butterfly garden, osprey nestingplatforms, and woods and meadows managed for hawks, owls,foxes and deer. Problem is, the new habitat is part of aplant that annually makes 4.5 million tons of coke, the fuelused to make steel.</LP><TEXT>   Maybe the buffalo won't mind roaming amid the coal gas,but the company has already drawn a few discouraging wordsfor its new home on the range. &quot;Whoopee ding dong,&quot; says JimSkowvron, president of the Southwest Pennsylvania Alliancefor a Clean Environment. &quot;It's still probably the majorpolluter in the area.&quot;   The steelmaker anticipates the irony in its press release.&quot;To the casual observer, the 500-acre Clairton coke plant --where 1,600 people work -- seems an unlikely backdrop for theserenity of adjacent wildlife areas,&quot; it says. Bill Graeser,the plant's environmental-control manager, concedes that theplant has had a &quot;multiplicity of environmental problems.&quot; Buthe says it has cut 95% of its emissions in recent years aspart of a $350 million environmental program. Apparently, theprogram has begun to work: Workers must often shoo deer offthe work site these days.   The Clairton plant is one of 38 corporate sites&quot;certified&quot; yesterday by the Wildlife Habitat EnhancementCouncil, a coalition of 75 corporations and 15 conservationgroups funded mostly by the former. U.S. Steel's vicepresident, environmental affairs, is the group's chairman,and four USX sites are being certified this year, includingthe Gary, Ind., mill, where the peregrine falcon has taken upresidence. Another honoree is Browning-Ferris IndustriesInc.'s Charlotte Motor Speedway Landfill in North Carolina.   &quot;It's the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing,&quot; says aGreenpeace USA spokesman. &quot;For a tiny step of environmentalpenance, they can buy years of time for environmentalabuses.&quot;   And it seems there's another reward for steelworkers atthe Clairton plant who suppress their roughhewn image longenough to watch birds, plant flowers and hug trees: The&quot;wildlife habitat&quot; will be open for hunting.</TEXT></DOC>
