<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-29-0183 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new chelating resin has been synthesized by introducing a quinaldinicacid amide group into styrene-divinyl benzene (8%) copolymer beads. Theresin is stable in fairly strong acids or alkali and has been characterizedby elemental analysis for nitrogen and from i.r. spectra. The water regainvalue is 0.37g/g. The sorption patterns of Na(I), K(I), Ca(II), Mg(II),Pb(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Hg(II) and Fe(III) on the chelatingresin have been studied as a function of pH. The resin selectively sorbsHg(II) over a wide pH-range of 2.5 - 7.6 with high efficiency. The maximumexchange capacity for Hg(II) is 1.98 mmols g{sup -1} at pH 5.5. Over99% of Hg(II) sorbed has been recovered by using 10% thiourea in 1M HClO{sub4} both by batch and column operations. The method has been utilizedin the preconcentration and recovery of Hg(II) from industrial and laboratorywaste water.</TEXT></DOC>
