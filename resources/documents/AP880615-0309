Ariane 4 blasted off without a hitch into clear skies above thespace agency center on the north coast of South America at 8:19a.m. Officials of Arianespace, the agency's commercial arm,proclaimed the inaugural launch ``a complete success.''   President Francois Mitterrand of France sent a telegram saying:``This new step in the space program assures the lasting presenceof Europe in the world launch competition that will be more andmore difficult.''   Arianespace already hauls half the world's commercial payloadsand has 67 launch contracts worth $3.4 billion. It counts onWednesday's launch to demonstrate the space readiness andreliability of the Ariane 4, Europe's biggest and most versatilerocket ever.   First-stage boosters fired 66 seconds after liftoff and thefinal, third-stage rockets, fired at 5 minutes 49 seconds into theflight. The rocket reached orbit in 12 minutes 46 seconds with itsinternational payload _ the European Meteosat P2 and Amsat 3C, andthe American PAS 1.   Technicians at the space center said the boosters fired andorbit was achieved precisely as planned. Frederic d'Allest,chairman of Arianespace, called the launch ``a milestone in thedevelopment of the European space effort.''   Europe developed the Ariane over six years at a cost of $575million and will compete in the coming decade with commerciallaunch programs in the United States, Soviet Union, China andJapan. By 1992, the international commercial launch market isexpected to be worth $1 billion a year.   The U.S. space program has been stalled since the shuttleChallenger blew up in January 1986, killing all seven astronautsaboard.   Ariane 4 will be Europe's ``workhorse on the world launchservices market until the end of this century,'' according to astatement by Arianespace officials. It can lift 4.6 tons into orbitcompared with 2.8 tons for Ariane 3, its predecessor.   The next rocket, Ariane 5, is not expected to begin serviceuntil 1995.   In addition to providing increased power, the Ariane 4 designallows engineers to use different configurations of solid andliquid boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's specificbudget and needs, the agency said.   On Wednesday it used two liquid and two solid boosters.   Meteostat-P2 will furnish weather data to 16 European countries.The 1,559-pound satellite will monitor weather over most of Europe,Africa, the Middle East and the eastern half of South America. Itreplaces the Meteostat F2, launched in 1981, which until recentlysent back pictures every half hour.   Amsat 3C, a 330-pound satellite known by the nickname Oscar 13,will serve the amateur radio operators around the world.   The American satellite PAS 1, owned by the Americantelecommunications company Pan American Satellite, is to providetelecommuncations service at moderate cost among Latin America, theUnited States and Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
