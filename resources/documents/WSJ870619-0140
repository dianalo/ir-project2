About 95 employees will be recalled for the line, which has been idle since July 1984.    When the production line resumes, the aluminum producer said operations will be working at 100% of capacity, the first time since 1980.    Reynolds said the lines were restarted because of a strong demand for aluminum and dwindling world-wide inventories. </TEXT></DOC>
