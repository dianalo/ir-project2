The powerful IG Metall metalworkers union threatened tobreak off contract talks and call for a strike ballot inmid-May if a settlement isn't reached by May 8. A series ofbrief warning strikes have been scheduled for this week.</LP><TEXT>   Franz Steinkuehler, IG Metall's chairman, expressed hopean agreement could be reached, but said this hope &quot;is notjustified when one looks at the facts.&quot;   Management and labor negotiators are deadlocked over IGMetall's demands for a 9% wage increase, work-free weekendsand a reduction in the official working week to 35 hours fromthe current 37.   While many labor analysts consider a protracted strikeunlikely, government officials worry that hefty wageconcessions could add an inflationary element to the WestGerman economy at an inopportune time. Moreover, theyquestion the readiness of the union's pampered rank-and-fileto follow a strike call.   IG Metall isn't budging. Tightly organized and grantedboard representation under liberal co-determination laws,West Germany's labor unions already have secured the highestwages and shortest work shifts in Europe. IG Metall, whichhas targeted this year to achieve a 35-hour working week,isn't listening to government appeals for moderation to avoidjeopardizing economic union with East Germany.   As Western Europe's largest union, with 2.6 millionmembers in the metals, automotive and computer sectors, IGMetall more than once has had a hand in shaping industrypolicy. Its last formal strike, in 1984, idled West Germany'sentire automotive industry for seven weeks, costing billionsof marks in lost profits and hobbling Europe's largesteconomy.   Warning strikes, usually one- or two-hour work stoppagesat selected plants to back threats of a permanent walkout,have become a standard ritual in West German labor talks. Fewanalysts say they believe the conflict will escalate to afull-scale walkout this time.   The Gesamtmetall employers association, which negotiatescontracts for industry, has signaled it is willing to sweetenits latest offer of a 5% wage increase. Moreover, it also hasshown willingness to give ground on the work-week issue --which could end up being written into contracts now forimplementation later.   Gesamtmetall Chief Dieter Kirchner urged industry tomaintain its nerve, claiming management and labor aren't thatfar apart. &quot;Given IG Metall's self-styled image as aconflict-oriented union, nobody expected a compromise priorto the expiration of the grace period,&quot; Mr. Kirchner said.&quot;Few would sympathize with a major strike at a time when theGerman-German economic and social union is set to start onJuly 2,&quot; he said.   Most economists are less worried about strikes than thecost of avoiding them. West Germany's construction workersalready got a 5.8% wage increase this year. The printers'union also is threatening strikes to back demands for heftywage increases and a shorter working week.   This year's labor-contract talks have spurred concern atthe Bundesbank, which reckons wage increases will boostinflationary pressures expected to come from monetary unionand a full production capacity after eight years of growth.The combination of price factors has prompted warnings of aclampdown on monetary growth with interest-rate increaseslater in the year.   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl warned late last weekthat economic strains are multiplying as a result of strongdomestic demand. &quot;Though only half of the work force are duefor new contracts, it could result in new strains by 1991 atthe latest if the wrong guidelines are set,&quot; Mr. Poehl said.</TEXT></DOC>
