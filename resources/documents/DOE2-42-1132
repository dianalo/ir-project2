Totest this theory spheres with aberrant permeability (steel, air) wereimaged immersed in water. The resulting images showed good agreementwith simulated images calculated under the above assumptions. The implicationsof these results concerning contrast media consisting of magnetic particlesare discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
