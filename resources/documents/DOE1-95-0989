In thisexperiment the production angles {Theta} of charged hadrons are measuredin the pseudorapidity range -5andless;etaandless;+5 were eta = - 1n tg {Theta}/2. Thedetector is not sensitive for elastic scattering and single diffractiondissociation. Results therefore are for the non single diffractive partof the inelastic pp-bar cross section.</TEXT></DOC>
