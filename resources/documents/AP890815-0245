Wussler announced Tuesday he wasresigning from Turner Broadcasting System Inc., ending a 10-yearrelationship in which the senior executive helped guide theinternational expansion of cable television concern.   Wussler will become president and chief executive officer ofCOMSAT Video Enterprises, a Washington-based satellite technologycompany. His departure set off a reorganization at the TBS executivesuites.   TBS Chairman Ted Turner issued a brief statement: ``It is withregret that I have accepted the resignation of TBS Senior ExecutiveVice President Robert Wussler. Bob has been an integral part of thegrowth and success of our company over the past decade.''   Wussler's duties at TBS will be split among several people.   Advertising, public relations and research will report to GerryHogan, president of Turner Entertainment Networks; the Braves, theHawks and Turner Sports will report to Terry McGuirk, president ofTurner Cable Network Sales; and the Goodwill Games, for whichWussler negotiated with the Soviet Union in 1986, will report toPaul Beckham, TBS senior vice president for finance andadministration.   Wussler joined TBS in 1980 after a 21-year career at CBS Inc. andsits on Turner's board of directors. At TBS, he was responsible foroverseeing the company's ongoing international expansion and itssports operations, which include the Atlanta Braves baseball teamand the Atlanta Hawks basketball team.   Wussler also was in charge of all TBS sports and non-fictionprogramming.   His resignation comes at a time when the company is riding high,having just reported its first quarterly profit in three years. TheCable News Network has recently signed an agreement to use a Sovietsatellite, allowing its signal to virtually cover the world.   The 1980s have seen TBS grow from a station known mostly for itsprogramming of reruns and Braves games to a media power thatincludes CNN, Headline News, the new TNT network and the MGM filmlibrary.   Wussler said in a telephone interview Tuesday that TBS has greatpotential for more growth.   ``I leave with great sadness. I've seen TBS grow from a couple ofhundred people to 4,500 (employees),'' he said. ``TBS is a wonderfulcorporation. There's no upper limit here.''   But he said he was ready for new challenges.   COMSAT, he said, ``asked me to come in and explore what expansionin software there can be in the '90s. There's going to be dramaticchanges in how we watch television and purchase equipment.''   Wussler's interest in satellite technology dates back to theearly 1960s, when he was involved in the expansion of satellite andminicam usage at CBS.   Wussler said he would begin the new job in early September, andthat it would probably take until then to wrap his business up atTBS.</TEXT></DOC>
