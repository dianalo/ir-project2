Meanwhile, Lech Walesa objected to continued pressure by theCommunist Party for more posts in the government, and Solidarityactivists urged tough measures to halt Poland's protracted economicproblems.   Mazowiecki has kept secret his Cabinet selections so far, but anoutline of the composition of the government could come as early asTuesday when Solidarity's parliamentary caucus meets.   Deputy Bronislaw Geremek, the caucus chairman, said in aninterview Monday that Mazowiecki is close to announcing thegovernment and that, in a break with tradition, parliament will haveseveral days to examine Cabinet nominees before voting.   ``We hope that in the next few days there will be a meeting ofthe club with the premier on the makeup of the new government, andthat by the end of the week hearings on candidates ... will be heldby particular Sejm committees,'' Geremek told the PAP news agency.   Geremek said, the Sejm, or parliament, could vote on the Cabinetearly next week. Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz said he expectedthe vote on Sept. 12 at the earliest.   In Gdansk, Walesa responded negatively Monday to Communist Partystatements Saturday that the party was promised a wide role in thenext government.   Communist First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski andparliamentary leader Marian Orzechowski did not go into details, butsaid Mazowiecki had promised them more than two portfolios.Orzechowski said the party would be represented in ``all basicspheres of life.''   The two leaders praised Mazowiecki as a ``realist'' and indicatedthere was no danger the party would put itself in open opposition toMazowiecki's government, as had been threatened several times sincehis election.   ``I must say that I do not like it,'' Walesa told reporters inGdansk when asked about those statements.   ``Poland belongs to everybody. ... If Poland is to be reformed,then (party members) have to enter the government as reformers, andnot as party members. ...They should think about Poland and reform,and not about the number of seats that fall to them.''   Walesa, citing a supervisory role he was granted last month in aresolution by the Solidarity caucus, said he would ``warn'' and``shout in protest'' if he saw someone getting a government postsimply by right of party affiliation.   ``In the Polish government ... there can be only reformersregardless of what kind of party cards they have,'' he said, and no``reserved seats.''   Before the selection of Mazowiecki as prime minister on Aug. 24,Solidarity promised the Communist Party that it would continue tohold the ministries of defense and internal affairs, controlling thearmy and the police.   Party Central Committee Secretary Slawomir Wiatr, interviewed inBonn on Monday, said the party wanted ``parity representation'' inthe government. He said that would mean six seats for the party, sixseats for Solidarity and six seats divided between the trade union'scoalition partners, the Peasants and the Democrats.   But Solidarity activists have hinted at a smaller role for theCommunist Party, saying that if it gets too many posts society willnot feel anything has changed.   Meanwhile, Solidarity activists writing in the pro-SolidarityGazeta Wyborcza newspaper on Monday stressed the need for drasticaction to boost the faltering Polish economy.   ``The economy is slipping out of control. We are on the verge ofhyperinflation,'' said a front-page commentary. ``This means thatthe activities of Premier Mazowiecki's government must be firm, deepand quick.''   It urged a tight monetary policy, an end to restrictions onprivate enterprise, the breakup of monopolies, sale of stateenterprises and immediate talks on rescheduling Poland's $39 billionforeign debt.   Solidarity Sen. Aleksander Paszynski, presented his own economicprogram in the same issue, advocated an immediate halt to stateindustrial investments, steep cuts in military spending,renegotiating economic agreements with East bloc countries andending most government price subsidies.</TEXT></DOC>
