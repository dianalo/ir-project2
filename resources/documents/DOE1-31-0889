Howeverfailures of liquid storage tanks during earthquakes indicate that somemechanism are not adequately addressed by current design procedures.Especially among unanchored tanks damages occur increasingly (Manos 1985).For these containers, the overturning moment caused by the hydrodynamicpressure tends to lift the shell off. If the cylindrical shell displacesupward, it acts against the tank bottom. Only the liquid pressure onthe bottom resists the upward moving shell. With the following representationwe present a finite element model, which includes the fluid-structureinteraction; the geometrical and physical nonlinearities of the vessel;the lift up of the tank bottom and the vertical component of the earthquake.</TEXT></DOC>
