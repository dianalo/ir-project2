Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CX OEC DQU </CO><IN> UTI NUK </IN><TEXT>   Negotiators for Centerior Energy Corp. and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio early next month will attempt to agree on how the costs of two new nuclear power plants will be split between ratepayers and utility shareholders.    The outcome may well determine the Cleveland-based electric utility holding company's dividends for the next several years. And rate levels could help determine the speed of recovery for the hard-hit northern Ohio economy.    Centerior's two units have stated their intention to file March 4 for rate increases. Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., the larger unit, plans to ask for a 9.8% rate increase and Toledo Edison Co. will seek a 9% rise. Such increases would raise about a combined $175 million in revenue annually, said Richard A. Miller, Centerior's president and chief operating officer.    Robert M. Ginn, chairman and chief executive, says it is Centerior's intention, subject to the commission's approval, for the nuclear-plant increases it will request in March and future overall rate increases approximately to equal the rate of inflation over the next 10 years. The rate increases, however, would exceed the cost of living in the first few years.    Thomas V. Chema, utilities commission chairman, said it is his intention to begin negotiations shortly after the filings. Representatives of consumer groups, industrial users and other interested parties would be invited to participate but the sessions wouldn't have the quasi-judicial flavor of a normal rate hearing.    Centerior has been paying a 64-cent common share dividend on a quarter-to-quarter basis, even though it has been forced to use borrowed money to make the payments. Directors haven't set a permanent rate because they &quot;want any dividend action to be sustainable,&quot; says Mr. Ginn.    Many analysts expected a dividend cut more than a year ago, and the price of the stock reflects that expectation. It closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $16.125, down 75 cents, where it yields more than 15%. However, creative financing last year helped maintain the dividend while Centerior learns what return it will get on about $4.2 billion spent on two nuclear plants that went into service in November.    Some analysts think the utilities commission will grant rate increases to the utility's subsidiaries too small to prevent some dividend cut. That way, the analysts say, commissioners could show they're defending consumers' interests while also keeping the utility financially solvent. Douglas A. Fox, an analyst with McDonald andamp; Co., says if there is a dividend cut, payout probably will be reduced to $1.60 to $1.80 annually from $2.56.    Mr. Ginn and Mr. Miller say they can't predict whether the 64-cent rate can be maintained longer-term until the commission acts. And it isn't clear whether that will happen before the board's next scheduled dividend meeting March 22.    If it's to avoid a dividend cut, Centerior would need sizable rate increases. Common stock dividends total about $350 million a year and the utility's cash flow from operations fell about $175 million short of that in 1987, the officials say.    Centerior, which posted revenue of $1.95 billion last year, was formed in April 1986 through the merger of what are now its two units. The units together own 51% of the Perry nuclear plant, about 35 miles east of Cleveland. And they owned 44% of another new nuclear unit at Beaver Valley in western Pennsylvania.    However, as part of its 1987 financing, Centerior negotiated a sale and lease-back that reduced its ownership in the Beaver Valley plant to 26% and its net investment in the two facilities to about $3.5 billion. (Akron, Ohio-based Ohio Edison Co. and Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Light Co. also are part owners of both plants.)    Already, the utilities commission has decided that $320.3 million of Centerior's investment at Perry was &quot;imprudently or unreasonably incurred,&quot; mostly because of delays which added to the final cost of the plant, and shouldn't be included in the rate base. Centerior is contesting that ruling.    For Centerior, a compromise accord could produce rate increases as early as mid-year and provide for a series of rate increases over several years. That would give Centerior a strong indication of the likely total return on its investment.    Both utilities commission and Centerior officials agree any rate increases will have to be phased in gradually to prevent rate shock that would be damaging to the northern Ohio economy and painful to consumers. However, the amount and timing will depend on decisions about how much of the nuclear capacity is needed now, when the rest will be necessary and what is an acceptable return on investment. </TEXT></DOC>
