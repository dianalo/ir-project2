We obtain analytical expressions for the relevant supermodesboth in the spatial and in the frequency domain. We show that the FELsupermodes form a bi-orthogonal basis. We also derive simple expressionsfor quantities of practical interest such as, for example, the widthof the cavity detuning curve.</TEXT></DOC>
