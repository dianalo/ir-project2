The most recent Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,effective Dec. 1, no longer provide for the alternates, whoused to fill in when regular jurors dropped out but whootherwise were sent home after watching an entire trial. Thechange applies only to civil cases, not to criminalprosecutions.</LP><TEXT>   Because the U.S. Supreme Court has said there must be atleast six jurors in civil cases, judges presiding insix-juror cases will still have to seat several extras toguard against falling below the six-juror threshold if someare disqualified. Unlike alternates, however, these extraswill now serve as full voting jurors from start to finish.Therefore, the ultimate size of juries rendering verdictswill vary, depending on how many jurors are disqualified ordrop out during the trial.   In rewriting the trial rule, the Judicial Conference ofthe United States cited widespread dissatisfaction withalternate jurors' second-class status. &quot;Many jury boxes don'teven have enough chairs, so that the alternates are stuck inthe corner, peeking out,&quot; said Thomas Munsterman, who studiesjuries for the National Center for State Courts inWilliamsburg, Va.   One by-product of the revision, jury specialists said, isthat it tempers the behavior of small juries. Six-personjuries were instituted in 1970 to save money and time; sixpeople tend to agree more readily than 12. But studies havefound that small juries are more apt than larger ones to beswayed by a single juror. In addition, minijuries are lesslikely than larger ones to be representative of an entirecommunity.   Legal specialists said the revision codifies a practicealready used by some federal and state judges, who haveallowed alternates to vote. In some areas, though, judgeshave permitted alternates to vote only if both parties to thelawsuit agree. State court practices won't be affected by thenew Federal Rules.   In 12-person federal juries, which are used at a judge'sdiscretion in civil cases, the new rules require that no morethan 12 members be seated. Illness and otherdisqualifications are likely to shrink many such juries, butthe risk of falling below six jurors -- and thus causing amistrial -- is considered minimal in most cases.   Nonetheless, a risk under the new system is that theabsence of alternates could result in mistrials in the raretrials that run longer than a year, said Richard Lempert, aprofessor of law at the University of Michigan. This is so,he said, because enough jurors may become ill orincapacitated for some reason during long cases to bring thetotal below the six-juror minimum. Previously, judges in longcases could seat as many alternates as they thought necessaryto guard against attrition.   For trial lawyers, specialists said, the new rule means ahairsbreadth more difficulty in swaying juries because thereare more people to convince. The change also means lawyersmust play to all jurors in a box, rather than neglecting thealternates, as some lawyers have done, said Judge WilliamSchwarzer, director of the Federal Judicial Center inWashington, D.C.   ---   RTC CAN HOLD environmental tests before foreclosing onproperty, judge rules.   A federal judge in the New York borough of Manhattan ruledthat the Resolution Trust Corp. has the right to inspect theproperty for hazardous waste before taking title to it. Thethrift regulatory agency owns a mortgage on the property atissue -- five gas stations in Manhattan -- but doesn't wantto take title to it until determining whether the propertyhas been contaminated. The RTC could be held liable for anenvironmental cleanup of the property once it forecloses.   The tenants and owners of the gas station argued that RTChas no right to conduct tests on the gas stations until afterforeclosing. But U.S. Judge Morris Lasker ordered the ownersand tenants to allow the RTC to enter the property and carryout the tests.   &quot;Not allowing the RTC to enter the property to performenvironmental studies could force it to incur seriouspotential liability for environmental cleanup or else forgoforeclosing on the property altogether,&quot; Judge Lasker said.The ruling could apply to other mortgage-holders seeking toforeclose on property that they fear might be contaminated.   Judge Lasker based his ruling on the language of astandard mortgage provision, which states that the lender has&quot;an absolute right to the immediate possession of themortgaged {property} and may enter upon said {property}.&quot;Although that provision wasn't specifically meant to includeenvironmental testing, Judge Lasker said allowing such tests&quot;seems a reasonable interpretation, in light of moderncircumstances and recent developments of law.&quot;   The judge also cited the federal law that created the RTCand directed the agency to maximize the return on property,such as the gas stations, received from failed savings andloans. &quot;Thus not allowing the RTC to conduct theenvironmental studies it seeks here could also frustrate thepurpose of&quot; the savings-and-loan law, Judge Lasker said.   Attorneys for the gas station owners and tenants couldn'tbe reached for comment.   (RTC v. Polmar Realty Inc., et al, U.S. District Court,New York, 91 Civ. 6685)   ---   LEGAL TEAMS take shape for Maxwell Communicationnegotiations.   As instructed by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Tina L. Brozman,lawyers involved in the Maxwell Communication Corp. PLCbankruptcy case are planning meetings in New York tocoordinate related Maxwell proceedings in Britain and theU.S.   The chief figures in the discussions are Richard A. Gitlinof the Hartford, Conn., law firm Hebb andamp; Gitlin, who is theU.S. court-appointed bankruptcy examiner in the case; andMark Homan of the London office of Price Waterhouse, one ofthree Maxwell administrators appointed by a British court.   Also involved are Barry N. Seidel of the New York law firmWillkie, Farr andamp; Gallagher, which filed the Chapter 11bankruptcy-law petition in Manhattan on behalf of the MaxwellCommunication board; John J. Jerome of Milbank, Tweed, Hadleyandamp; McCloy representing the Price Waterhouse administrators;and Leonard M. Rosen of New York's Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp;Katz, who represents the main creditor banks.   Typically, U.S. law aims to permit troubled companies tocontinue operating under current management while theyreorganize, while British law pays more deference to thecreditors' demands that they be paid quickly. The lawyers aimin their holiday-week talks to work out an ad hoc procedurethat respects the jurisdictions of both the U.S. and U.K.courts that are involved.   Such a procedure will be needed not only to determine theultimate fate of the company's assets but also, in the shortterm, to facilitate the operation and financing of MaxwellCommunication. The negotiators must report to Judge Brozmanby Jan. 3.</TEXT></DOC>
