Bell Communications Research spelled out technicalrequirements for so-called fiber-in-the-loop systems, ornetworks that use optical fiber to carry phone traffic intoneighborhoods. Fiber-in-the-loop systems can deliver a wideselection of video and other information services.</LP><TEXT>   The Bellcore document specifies features and functionsthat equipment makers must consider as they build equipmentfor networks that carry telephone traffic to neighborhoods onfiber optic cables. It also defines services the fibersystems are expected to provide and examines changes innetwork design needed to provide such future services asvideo-on-demand and interactive video.   Bellcore provides research for the seven regional Belltelephone companies as well as Cincinnati Bell and SouthernNew England Telecommunications Co.</TEXT></DOC>
