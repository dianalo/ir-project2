Starr to be solicitorgeneral, the government's chief representative before the SupremeCourt.   Starr's willingness to give up his lifetime appointment on theU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was seenin legal circles as a good way to put himself in the running for afuture nomination to the Supreme Court.   Following a similar route, Thurgood Marshall gave up a federaljudgeship to become solicitor general in 1965, and two years laterhe was named by Lyndon B. Johnson to the high court.   At 42, Starr is regarded by many courthouse observers as tooyoung to want to spend the rest of his career on the D.C. Circuit.However, there may be political risks in the solicitor's job ifStarr eventually wants to go to the high court.   As solicitor general, Starr likely would be the person to urgethe high court to overturn its 1973 abortion-rights decision _ aposition that could elicit strong opposition from pro-abortionforces if he is later nominated as a justice.   Starr was a clerk for former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger andlater a partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn andamp;Crutcher. He served as counselor to then-Attorney General WilliamFrench Smith from 1981 until his appointment to the D.C. appealscourt in 1983.   The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer,arguing cases before the Supreme Court and deciding whether toappeal lower court decisions against federal agencies.   If confirmed by the Senate, Starr would succeed Charles Fried,who resigned to return to Harvard University Law School.</TEXT></DOC>
