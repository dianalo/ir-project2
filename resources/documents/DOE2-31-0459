<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0459 </DOCNO><TEXT>A fiber-optic strain monitoring system for the NDE of composite materialsis described and some initial strain measurements in a uniaxial graphite/epoxycoupon are evaluated. The system is based on the effect of strain inducedbirefringence and the change in polarization state of a polarized opticalsignal from a laser passing through the test composite. Block diagramsof the instrumentation and the signal conditioner are included. Resultsare given for an optical fiber embedded into a 16 ply laminate made fromHercules AS4/3501-6 graphite prepeg.</TEXT></DOC>
