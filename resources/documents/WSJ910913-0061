He just got onhis Gulfstream jet and flew off to Boston. &quot;Never celebrate,never rest,&quot; he said, coining a phrase.   But these days, the 68-year-old Mr. Maxwell is looking abit tired. He has spent much of the past decade trying tobuild a global communications empire with annual revenue hehoped would approach $8 billion by 1990. Now, with that goalstill unattained, he faces the humbling task of reshaping andto some extent dismantling much of what he built. Hugeinterest costs, plus debt payments that begin coming due inabout 13 months, are likely to force him to slough off atweak prices properties that cost him a fortune just a fewyears ago. Two days ago, Mr. Maxwell said he expected to payoff $750 million in long-term debt by selling as many aseight of his enterprises.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Maxwell is girding for what lies ahead, and that couldentail some radical moves. One possibility: spinning off hisU.S. businesses -- Berlitz, Macmillan books, Collierencyclopedias, and others -- into a separate public company.Though he cherishes the properties, he appears to be willingto step back and hold onto a mere minority stake -- quite acomedown for the brash, publicity-loving media mogul.   The Czech-born Mr. Maxwell, who works out of London, isthe latest in a long line of deal-makers of the 1980s --ranging from media baron Rupert Murdoch to Canada's RobertCampeau -- chastened by the riskiness of debt in the 1990s.Mr. Maxwell took on his debt with some glee, patchingtogether a string of businesses that had little in commonwith one another: foreign language lessons, a guide toairline schedules, newspapers in several countries, books andnewsletters in the U.S., soccer team in the U.K., and so on.   If a coherent strategy existed for that mix, it was all inthe head of Mr. Maxwell -- &quot;Capt. Bob&quot; to the jeering Britishpress. In the leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s, scores ofindustrial companies were swallowed up without much regard towhether they fit well together; but media companies, becausethey share a common, essentially intangible product --information -- were supposed to be a different matter. Theywere to offer fundamental and peculiar synergies.   So far, however, the Maxwell properties have benefitedlittle if at all from synergy. Asked about strategic links,Mr. Maxwell can readily point to only one nascent effort: HisNimbus Records classical-music division has a compact-diskplant that has begun putting Macmillan textbooks on CD-ROMdisks.   He claims that synergy also is obvious in his ownership ofnewspapers in Hungary, Israel, Kenya and Berlin: &quot;I ownnewspapers, don't I?&quot; And while he also has formed a newmultimedia unit for disseminating information electronically,he sold off a technical publisher that might have been itsnatural supplier; he needed to cover interest costs.   &quot;He is, fundamentally, a deal-maker. But he isn't so goodat focusing on operations,&quot; contends Donald R. Fruehling, whowas president of a Maxwell publishing unit and quit after aclash with Mr. Maxwell earlier this year. &quot;Is there along-term strategy? I don't see one.&quot;   Former executives and advisers describe the Maxwellholdings as a confused agglomeration without linked resourcesand linked brainpower. Analysts find it increasinglydifficult to follow Mr. Maxwell's empire because he has soldoff and acquired so many businesses, swapping others aroundamong various of his corporate entities. They worry that ifone subsidiary collapsed, hidden financial ties to some otherMaxwell enterprise might pull that down, too.   Mr. Maxwell doesn't yet face the nutcracker that squeezedarchrival Rupert Murdoch of News Corp., which, saddled withnearly $8 billion in debt, was forced by its bankers to shedmajor assets. The $3 billion or so debt of Mr. Maxwell'spublic and private businesses doesn't begin coming due untilOctober 1992. But trouble looms nonetheless.   At Maxwell Communication Corp., which holds most of hisU.S. properties, nearly all operating profit in the fiscalyear that ended March 31 came from currency trading andone-time gains. And interest payments wiped out most of that.At Robert Maxwell Group Ltd., his private holding company,the Daily News in New York continues to lose more than $1million a week, and the European, a weekly that cost $41million to start last year, is also losing money. In Mr.Maxwell's publicly held Mirror Group Newspapers PLC, theRacing Times, a new U.S. daily devoted to the horses, willcost at least $20 million before it begins to turn a profit afew years down the track.   &quot;Basically, his real business, publishing, is at astandstill,&quot; says Peter Checketts of European Media Businessand Finance, a London newsletter. Yet Maxwell Communicationalone has to come up with a $750 million payment of principalin October 1992, followed by a bigger hit -- $1.25 billion --in 1994. Thus the need to sell assets.   Mr. Maxwell and his 32-year-old son, Kevin, who is chiefexecutive of Maxwell Communication, insist they aren't in adebt bind. The purpose of any spinoff would be to &quot;enhanceshareholder value,&quot; not to raise cash, Kevin Maxwell says. Hesays the company knew assets would have to be sold off whenit arranged an initial $3 billion loan to buy Macmillan andother properties in 1988.   Robert Maxwell says he isn't worried. &quot;Why should I feelpressure? My next appointment with my bankers is 18 monthsaway.&quot;   The senior Mr. Maxwell's effort to steer his companies outof trouble is complicated by his personal style. As thefinancial pressure has mounted, the mercurial Mr. Maxwellseems to have managed to alienate -- to one degree or another-- the press that covers him, the financial analysts whofollow his stocks, some top Maxwell executives, and severaldeal-makers with whom he might otherwise do business.   There are those who believe Mr. Maxwell's own presence inhis companies is a drag on stock prices. By one calculation,based on price-earnings ratios, Mirror Group trades atone-half to one-third the valuation accorded U.S. newspapercompanies. &quot;The Maxwell Factor,&quot; one U.S. banker calls this.   Mr. Maxwell's own staff takes the most heat. In the pastyear, his combustible style has led to an exodus of topbrass. At Macmillan alone, at least seven executives havequit, including the chief financial officer, the generalcounsel and three vice presidents. Most of them speak of Mr.Maxwell's volatile personality.   &quot;He's a hard man to live with,&quot; says Bob Smith, the formerpresident of a graphics company that Mr. Maxwell later sold.&quot;He operates as if he is the sun and you are the moon. Heloves to do things himself -- and more often than not he isright. But the question is, can he do it all in a 24-hourday? Can anyone?&quot;   Mr. Fruehling resigned last February as president ofMaxwell Macmillan International Publishing Group afterenduring a bawling-out from Mr. Maxwell at a meeting withother executives. &quot;He started screaming at me, `Why in helldid you do this?' and everything had been approved by him. Atthe end of the session, I got up and said to him: `You meetyour financial obligations to me, and I'm leaving,'&quot; Mr.Fruehling recalls. Mr. Maxwell, he adds, &quot;was upset with mebecause I wasn't checking with him all the time. But if youdid phone him every day, he gave you instructions that madeno sense.&quot;   When asked why he runs through so many executives, Mr.Maxwell replies: &quot;Ask them.&quot; Is he hard to get along with? &quot;Iget along fine with myself.&quot;   Industry executives began wondering whether Mr. Maxwellwas in trouble last March, when he sold off a publishing gemhe had owned since shortly after World War II. Mr. Maxwellpeddled Pergamon Press PLC to the Dutch concern ElsevierN.V., fetching a handsome #440 million ($764.9 million) andusing the #150 million profit to reduce debt.   But the sale deprived Maxwell Communication of the 20% ofits profit that Pergamon had always provided. Moreover,Maxwell lost a crucial contributor to cash flow: Some 75% ofthe technical publisher's more than #200 million in annualsales came in up front, in the form of subscriptions.   Analysts think they know why Mr. Maxwell sold such a vitalasset: Because he couldn't find buyers for other properties.   Several potential U.S. buyers say they are wary of Mr.Maxwell these days, and they speak of him as unpredictable.One publishing executive says he recently reached a handshakeagreement to acquire Berlitz, but the executive claims thedeal fell through when Mr. Maxwell reneged and demanded moremoney; Mr. Maxwell couldn't be reached yesterday for commenton this or on another negotiating incident.   In that one, another bidder for Berlitz tells ofnegotiating in a trans-Atlantic phone call to Mr. Maxwell,only to hear snoring emerge from his speaker phone. &quot;Bob?Bob? Are you there?&quot; the potential buyer says he blurted.&quot;There was no response,&quot; he says. &quot;Finally I had to shout:Wake up, Bob.&quot; When talks resumed, buyer and seller foundthemselves far apart, the bidder says, and a transactionwasn't completed.   As a buyer, Mr. Maxwell has been just as unpredictable --and, in the view of some, unreliable. In May 1990, heballyhooed his agreement to acquire the Globe, NationalExaminer and Sun tabloids for more than $100 million. But thedeals were never closed.   Globe International Publishing Inc. executives hadexpected to sign the deal but were surprised at the closingwhen Mr. Maxwell demanded they lop off another 10% from theprice. They called off the deal. &quot;Personally he's charming,&quot;says Dean Heine, a Globe senior executive vice president. &quot;Hemade an offer we originally found attractive. But the valuekept changing.&quot;   Mr. Maxwell offered up other surprises after acquiring theDaily News from Tribune Co. earlier this year. At first heseemed to be the savior of the paper and its striking unions.But he negotiated staff cuts that were about as drastic asthe Tribune-proposed reductions that the unions had bitterlyfought. While Mr. Maxwell insists the Daily News can turn aprofit by the end of the year, he also warns he will simplyshut it down if that forecast doesn't come true by early nextyear.   Elsewhere in Mr. Maxwell's far-flung holdings, the tempoof asset sales is likely to quicken. The Maxwells plan toraise up to $220 million by selling shares in Scitex Ltd., abooming Israeli computer-graphics concern. Mr. Maxwell ischairman and holds a 19.3% stake.   As many as eight assets in Maxwell Communication are to besold by March 31. That could include Collier's Encyclopedia,as well as the money-losing U.K. magazine division and thefamous Marquis Who's Who reference books. Theonce-acquisitive Mr. Maxwell also may try to sell off theOfficial Airline Guides, though he denies that. But analystsfigure he would be lucky to get back even $500 million of the$750 million he originally spent.   Says one of Mr. Maxwell's current London financialadvisers: &quot;Anybody who bought properties in 1987 or 1988would have a tough time in today's environment achieving thesame values&quot; in a cash-raising sale. Still, he insists Mr.Maxwell's basic U.S. businesses are &quot;first-class&quot; and canalways find buyers if needed.   For Mr. Maxwell, the pressure for asset sales is all themore intense because of a stumbling financial performance.Analysts were startled to learn that his biggest business,Maxwell Communication, relied on currency translation andtrading, as well as one-time items for more than 90% of the#145.5 million in pretax profit it reported for the mostrecent fiscal year. Operating profit of #200.2 million wasall but wiped out by interest payments of #195.6 million. Inthe current fiscal year, interest payments may eat #115million out of a #160 million operating profit.   Mr. Maxwell and his family own 30.6% of MaxwellCommunication (Berlitz, Macmillan, the airline guides, Who'sWho, Collier, and most other U.S. operations). A secretive,Liechtenstein-registered family trust, Maxwell CharitableFoundation, owns 37.7%, putting the Maxwell family stake at#803.3 million. The remainder is publicly held.   In Mirror Group, Maxwell interests own 51%, with thebalance publicly held. Mr. Maxwell and family own all ofRobert Maxwell Group, a private holding company that includesthe Daily News and other newspapers, his soccer team and oddsand ends.   The financial ties between them aren't clear. &quot;How theyare linked is one of the most closely guarded secrets in theempire,&quot; known only to Mr. Maxwell and perhaps his son. SusanHeilbron, who lasted all of seven months as MaxwellCommunication's general counsel, says she struggled tounderstand the very companies she legally represented: &quot;Fromthe first day I got there, I tried to get a list of all theprivate and public companies that Maxwell owns. When I left,I still didn't have one.&quot;   When he needs money to pay debt, Mr. Maxwell sometimesjuggles funds by selling a property from one unit to asibling unit, or by using his stake in one as collateral forloans to another. Last year, when Maxwell Communicationneeded to cover interest and consolidate properties, Mr.Maxwell had Mirror Group pay Maxwell Communication $240million for partial stakes in two Canadian printingcompanies. In a new deal with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Mr.Maxwell has raised just over $240 million for Robert MaxwellGroup by pledging as collateral some of his stock in MirrorGroup and Maxwell Communication.   The maneuvering raises suspicion among certain critics.&quot;Part of the way he has cut debt is to sell assets tocompanies he controls,&quot; says Jeff Matthews of RockerPartners, a money-management firm that has sold Maxwellshares short in the past, betting they will decline. &quot;WhenNews Corp. was in trouble, you could at least follow what wasgoing on. With Maxwell, what's alarming is how complex andinterrelated things are.&quot;   The prickly and litigious Mr. Maxwell lashes out at thosewho suggest his empire is wobbly. Mr. Maxwell earlier thissummer sued and won a British High Court injunction againstLondon's Independent newspaper, which had published scathingarticles.   In a recent interview with a Wall Street Journal reporterbased in New York, Mr. Maxwell called questions about whetherhe was selling properties &quot;vulgar and libelous.&quot; When thereporter asked what would happen if one of his companies wereto default, Mr. Maxwell replied: &quot;You are acting like acreep.&quot; In London, another Journal reporter doing routineinterviews was phoned by a Maxwell spokesman and accused ofmaking &quot;defamatory statements.&quot;   Analysts have felt his wrath as well. In the City,London's financial district, an analyst was sacked lastspring after writing a &quot;can't recommend a purchase&quot; report onMr. Maxwell's Mirror Group. Now several City analysts nolonger follow his companies, in part to avoid legal action.   &quot;You can't make a forecast because you don't know whatcompanies he will have around next time,&quot; complains oneLondon analyst, then apologizes for being afraid to be quotedby name: &quot;It sounds cowardly, but what's the use of havingwrits slapped on you?&quot;   Some insiders, however, counter that Mr. Maxwell can be asupportive and hands-off proprietor. In the case of one ofhis strongest assets, Macmillan Inc., he has been anunobtrusive owner and enjoyed good results.   &quot;Not only has he not been a negative to us, he has been apositive,&quot; says Harry McQuillen, president of MacmillanPublishing. &quot;He has helped get some big authors. Heencourages us to invest in things like computer books and thereference business.&quot;   Indeed, the Macmillan business may be the ripest area forsynergy so far. At Christmas, a tiny Boston unit calledMaxwell Electronic Publishing will introduce a children'sdictionary on CD-ROM, adapted from a popular dictionarypublished by the Macmillan division. The Boston unit also haspackaged five years' editions of six medical journals on adisk, culling the medical material from a computerized dataservice called Maxwell On-Line Inc.   Money isn't made from synergy alone. David Shaffer, headof all North American operations of Maxwell Communication,which includes the Macmillan division, says $15 million ayear is saved just from integrating data-processing systems,closing down three data centers.   Though Mr. Maxwell is rarely seen at fancy book partiesand publishing lunches, he occasionally uses his connectionsto the powerful, another instance of synergy. He personallypersuaded a much-wooed George Shultz to write his memoirs forMacmillan (due next spring) and authorized a big advance,rumored to be $2 million.   In more recent times, Mr. Maxwell has taken a higherprofile. The morning of the abortive coup in the SovietUnion, he was called on as an expert because of his contactwith Mikhail Gorbachev; he even made an appearance on &quot;CBSThis Morning.&quot; Last year he had promised to donate $50million to form a Gorbachev Maxwell Institute on Technologyin Minneapolis. But so far nobody in Minnesota has seen adime of Maxwell money.   Still, editors at Macmillan say that Mr. Maxwell doesn'tpush pet projects and that mostly he leaves his managers torun the business. They have done that very well. For the yearended March 31, Macmillan's publishing ventures enjoyed a 35%increase in profit on a 22% sales increase. Itsgeneral-interest publishing unit rarely pays big advances andeschews splashy marketing, but it had eight best sellers lastyear.   But even in running Macmillan, Mr. Maxwell has had to denypersistent reports that he is shopping the valuable assetaround. Macmillan was the centerpiece of his U.S. effortswhen he bought it for $2.7 billion. Analysts say he wouldn'tfind anyone willing to pay that for it today.   Yet insiders at Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc.say Mr. Maxwell or associates approached them about sellingMacmillan. He vehemently denies that. Macmillan, he says, is&quot;off limits. We have already turned down many offers.&quot; AndMr. Maxwell maintains he is still on the prowl to buy newproperties, recently telling a gathering of financial writersthat he has his eye on several U.S. media companies.</TEXT></DOC>
