Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House DefenseAppropriations Committee, said the damage could be as much as halfa billion dollars after touring the base on Monday.   Army officials here at Fort Hood, the largest armed installationin the free world, said their first inspections could not determinehow many of the $13.4 million helicopters were affected bySaturday's powerful storm.   The Apache, one of the Army's most modern helicopters, isdesigned to take on tanks. It can carry 16 laser-homing Hellfiremissiles or 76 rockets and has a 30mm machine gun that can firevarious kinds of ammunition.   The storm, packing howling thunderstorms and 95 mph winds, alsodamaged two public schools, family housing, barracks and otherequipment.   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told Phoenix radio station KFYI therewere indications that more than 100 AH-64 Apache helicopters out ofthe 190 on the base were damaged.   ``Of those, about 35 will require extensive maintenance,'' hesaid from his Washington office. He said it would be some monthsbefore those helicopters would be ready to return to service, ``ifat all.''   Fort Hood is home to the Apache Training Brigade. The damageforced the base to downgrade its state of aviation readiness, saidArmy Chief of Staff Gen. Carl E. Vuono.   ``We have flown in a number of teams to make a detailedtechnical assessment,'' Vuono said. ``They will decide whichaircraft can be repaired on site and which will have to be taken toa depot for repairs.''   The storms knocked over many of the helicopters and bent orbroke rotor blades, said base spokeswoman Liz Crossan. She couldnot say whether any of the aircraft were destroyed or how much ofthe fleet was damaged.   Ms. Crossan said it was impossible to say how many helicopterswere damaged until inspection teams examine each one, because somedamage might not be immediately visible. It was not known how longthe inspections would take, she said.   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, who also toured the base, put thedamage at several hundred million dollars. ``The good news is thatno one was killed,'' he said.   Stu Dodge, a vice president of Apache programs at McDonnellDouglas Helicopter Co. in Mesa, Ariz., said his company wasawaiting an Army damage report before taking any action.   McDonnell Douglas has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contractwhich called for 975. President Bush said last month in unveilinghis defense cuts that the Army now wants only 807, 168 fewer.   The cutback would trim Apache production from the current 10 amonth to six a month beginning in June 1990.   McDonnell Douglas announced May 2 that it would lay off thismonth 450 temporary and regular employees, 355 at Mesa and 95 atits plant in Culver City, Calif, and the same number next yearbecause of the cutback.</TEXT></DOC>
