The present study was carried out under the termsof the IEA Implementing Agreement for Cooperation in Development of theStellarator Concept by researchers from the Kyoto University Plasma PhysicsLaboratory in Japan, the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Plasmaphysik in theFederal Republic of Germany and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory andthe Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in the United States of America.This executive summary is being published as ORNL/TM-10482 by the OakRidge National Laboratory, as IPP-2/286 by the Max-Planck-Institut fuerPlasmaphysik, and as PPLK-7 by the Kyoto University Plasma Physics Laboratory.The full report will be published as ORNL/TM-10483, IPP-2/287, and PPLK-8.The eight numbered sections of the executive summary correspond to thefirst eight chapters of the full report. An introduction to the topicis followed by an assessment of the existing data base, a discussionof the information expected from the present generation of experiments,and brief reviews of facilities needed in the future, engineering issues,and reactor considerations. The executive summary concludes with a statementof the essential ideas presented in this document and in the full report.</TEXT></DOC>
