Ms. Tutwiler made no direct reference to further clashes betweenIsraeli soldiers and Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bankthat followed Wednesday's stabbings.   But she said:   ``We are shocked and saddened by the increase in violence andsenseless killing arising from confrontation between Israelis andPalestinians in the occupied territories. We urge all those whotruly seek peace to condemn such acts and to work together toachieve a durable Arab-Israeli peace.''   Israeli soldiers fatally shot a Palestinian who broke through anarmy roadblock on Thursday, and Arabs shot a Palestinian accused ofcollaborating with Israeli authorities.
