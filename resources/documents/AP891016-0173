WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House late Monday abandoned alast-ditch effort to reach a compromise with Congress on expandingfederally financed abortions to cover cases of rape and incest.   A veto of the provision, which has already passed the House,appeared inevitable.   ``It's our judgement at this time that no one has been able toprovide a convincing reason for the president to change hisposition'' opposing such funds, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater said. ``So the president will not change his position.''   The White House and congressional conservatives had searched fora formula for compromise Monday in hopes of defusing thepolitically charged debate.   On Friday, President Bush said he was seeking ``room forflexibility.''   ``I'm not looking for any conflict over this,'' Bush said lastweek. ``I'm not going to change my position any. but let's see howthose negotiations come out.''   The administration was looking for what one White Houseofficial, insisting on anonymity, called ``legislative wizardry orgimmickery'' that would have allowed Bush to avoid a veto of theprovision.   But abortion-rights leaders stood firm in their unwillingness toyield, and congressional Democratic leaders held out little hopefor a compromise that would ease the pressure building on Bush.   ``I would think it is difficult to find a path to compromise onthis,'' House Speaker Tom Foley said.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, asked if therewas a compromise brewing, said, ``I know of none.''   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu met Monday withRepublican anti-aborton leaders in Congress _ Reps. Vin Weber,R-Minn., Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and Henry Hyde, R-Ill. _ justas he did on Friday.   ``We have made every effort ... and have decided basically thereis not'' any possibility to find common ground, Fitzwater said.   ``I don't think really there was ever much opportunity to getclose,'' he added.   Fitzwater said ``senior advisers'' to the president ``haverecommended a veto.''   Although the Sununu talks were private, congressional sourcessaid they were aimed at finding a way for Bush to avoid vetoing thenew abortion provisions, or failing that, to provide compromiselanguage that Bush could propose after using his veto that wouldsoften its political impact.   Fitzwater said talks included a proposal that Bush sign thelegislation while announcing government regulations requiringstricter reporting requirements. Those requirements would be aimedat preventing women from later claiming they had been victims ofrape or incest merely as a way of obtaining a federally paidabortion.   The debate concerned the appropriations bill for the Labor andHealth and Human Services departments that includes provisionsdropping a decade-long ban on abortions for poor women in cases ofrape or incest. Currently, Medicaid abortions are permitted only incases where the mother's life is endangered by her pregnancy.   The House surprised anti-abortion leaders last week by approvingthe provision, which had been passed by the Senate earlier.   Some attempts at compromise centered on defining the time limitrequired for reporting rape or incest by the victims seeking anabortion. The bill only says the victim must ``promptly'' reportthe rape or incest to authorities.   Abortion rights leaders flatly rejected a GOP proposal to set a48-hour time limit. Congressional sources said other proposals werebeing circulated setting a time limit of 60 days on reportingincest and 72 hours on reporting rape.   Bush had threatened to veto the proposal before the House vote.But the House's vote is being viewed as part of a changingpolitical climate in favor of abortion rights, and pro-choiceleaders said a veto by Bush would produce a political backlashagainst himself and congressional Republicans.   ``If he vetos it, it hurts him,'' said Sen. Robert Packwood,R-Ore., a supporter of abortion rights. ``It hurts our party. Ithurts our candidates.''   Packwood said the veto, coming now, could prove particularlydamaging for the Republican candidates for governor in Virginia andNew Jersey, the two states with races this fall in which abortionhas been successfully used by pro-choice Democrats againstanti-abortion Republicans.   The bill next goes to the Senate for agreement on a separateprovision.   Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family ResearchCouncil and a former policy adviser in the Reagan administration,predicted that following a veto, conservatives would attempt ``towork out something ... that wouldn't give the right-to-life peopleheartburn and at the same time allow the pro-choice groups to claimsome progress.''   Fitzwater, meanwhile, said Bush's position on the bill isconsistent, although it has changed somewhat since he first ran forpresident in 1980.   Bush, he said, opposes abortion except in the cases of rape,incest or when the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. But hesupports federal financing of abortion only in cases where themother's life is in danger.   Asked why Bush makes a distinction, Fitzwater said he wasconcerned that women would use rape or incest as a pretext to getfederally financed abortions and therefore ``you have norestrictions at all. ... That's why the president has a federalfunding position that's somewhat different than his moral belief.''</TEXT></DOC>
