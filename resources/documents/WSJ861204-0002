Concern about the Iranian arms scandal eased yesterday, traders said, but a report that October single-family home sales declined refocused the market's attention on the lackluster U.S. economy.    Trading volume was thin, dealers said, and is expected to keep declining as the end of the year nears.    &quot;We've been in the same range for three sessions now, and we're heading into real slow times in the foreign-exchange market,&quot; said Daniel E. Holland, a trader at Discount Corp. of New York. &quot;People don't want to take on new positions toward the year-end, and there is less and less liquidity in the market.&quot;    The lack of players may set the stage for some sharp daily swings in exchange rates, but no major new directions are expected to develop until next year, traders said.    Traders said President Reagan's call Tuesday for an independent counsel to investigate the arms sales to Iran had a more positive effect on the market yesterday. The president's address at first had little impact on the market.    Douglas E. Hart II, head of corporate foreign exchange at Credit Suisse, New York, said, &quot;For the time being, the worry over the dollar and the Iranian arms sales seems to have dissipated.&quot;    But not all concern has disappeared. A trader at one New York bank said fallout from the secret action could cause long-term problems for the dollar if the controversy lets Democrats strengthen their hold on both houses of Congress in the 1988 elections.    The U.S. currency did come under renewed pressure yesterday after the U.S. Commerce Department reported that single-family home sales fell 9.6% in October.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.9693 West German marks, down from 1.9773 Tuesday. The dollar eased to 161.95 Japanese yen from 162.00. The British pound rose to $1.4333 from $1.4317.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 161.83 yen from 161.95 in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $2.90 an ounce, to $392.20, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $393.05 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                      CURRENCY RATES                            New York    Home Mkt.
