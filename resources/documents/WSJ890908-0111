Or didn't he?    It sounded as if Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, did call on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. But Mr. Boskin says he didn't -- and certainly didn't intend to do so.    Responding to a question at a breakfast sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce yesterday, Mr. Boskin said, &quot;My own personal view is that there are signs of softness in the economy from where we are now, um, that further easing would probably be appropriate.&quot;    At least that's how it sounds on a tape recording made by The Wall Street Journal. And that's how the man who asked the question, Chamber economist Richard Rahn, heard it.    The financial markets hiccuped. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan called Mr. Boskin's office for clarification.    But Mr. Boskin, after assuring his staff that he hadn't made any news, flew to Maine to deliver a speech. He insists that he said nothing more than what he has said publicly before: that the Fed should ease if the economy weakens. &quot;I definitely said 'if,'&quot; Mr. Boskin said in a telephone interview. &quot;Maybe I said it sideways or not into the microphone.&quot;    Four weeks ago, White House Budget Director Richard Darman made headlines when he said unambiguously on television that the Fed should lower interest rates. Two days later, President Bush endorsed that call. Mr. Boskin didn't join that chorus.    The Fed hasn't altered monetary policy since it nudged down rates a bit in late July. Several Federal Reserve policy makers have indicated in recent interviews that they aren't likely to lower interest rates further unless they see additional evidence of economic weakness. </TEXT></DOC>
