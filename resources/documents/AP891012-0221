Ronald Hilton Arab, 52, and his wife, Eileen Audrey Arab, 53,both of Vancouver, each pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count ofconspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and one count ofmoney laundering.   They were arrested on May 25, along with Karl Erick Nissen, 62,of Norrkoping, Sweden. All were charged with scheming to shipmillions of dollars in aircraft parts and weapons to Iran.   An Oct. 23 hearing has been set for Nissen, who is accused ofsending 13 heating tubes from F4C fighter jets to Iran. AssistantU.S. Attorney Robert Berg said the Arabs have agreed to testifyagainst Nissen as part of a plea bargain.   Nissen and the Arabs were arrested after an 18-monthinvestigation by Customs Service agents, who posed as armssuppliers.   Sentencing for the couple has been set for Dec. 18. Each of theArabs faces a maximum of 15 years imprisonment and $1.5 million infines.   Nissen's attorney, Bill May, said the Arabs' plea comes as nosurprise, but that his client will go to trial.   ``It's frequently the case that people who are clearly guiltymake agreements to testify against people not so clearly guilty sothey can get off,'' May said. ``I think that's what you seehappening.''</TEXT></DOC>
