SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hope for a wetter summer is blossoming in thewake of recent coastal rains, but drought continues in severalsections of the nation.   Wheat-growing areas of Kansas and adjacent Texas and Oklahomaremain particularly dry, and area legislators have already begun tocomplain about lack of concern in Washington.   In the Northeast, meanwhile, a dry winter left reservoirs low,threatening water supplies in parts of New York, New Jersey,Pennsylvania and other parts of the Delaware River basin.   New York Mayor Edward Koch declared a drought emergency andimposed strict water-use limits last week, citing low reservoirlevels that have not been replenished by winter snowfalls, thoughrecent rains may help some.   Recalling low river flows that restricted shipping in thenation's midsection last year, the navigation season on theMissouri River is being shortened by five weeks to allow water tobe held in reserve at reservoirs, which are only about 60 percentfull.   David Miskus of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's Climate Analysis Center reports that storms alongthe Gulf and East coasts have helped ease the dryness theresomewhat in recent days, and more moisture is expected in thePacific Coast states.   Incoming storms could also bring some needed moisture to themiddle of the nation this week, Miskus said.   The long-term outlook through mid-April calls for above normalprecipitation in the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes and theNortheast.   But that projection also indicates below normal rain in Georgia,Florida and adjacent states and in a large area including Wyoming,South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico and northernTexas and Oklahoma. Some of those areas are badly in need ofmoisture.   Over the winter, fierce winds eroded nearly 4.7 million acres ofland in the Great Plains, one of the most extensive losses onrecord, according to an Agriculture Department survey.   ``Much of this damage is due to the drought,'' said WilsonScaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation Service. ``Wewent into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of theGreat Plains because of the drought. Then this winter, we've had acombination of no snow cover and high-velocity winds in manyareas.''   In addition to the land damaged during the four-month period,Scaling said more than 22.5 million acres were ``in condition toblow'' as of March 1, the most in 32 years. Highest on the list areKansas, North Dakota and Texas, he said.   Farm state lawmakers, meanwhile, say the Department ofAgriculture is mishandling last year's emergency drought relief andignoring this year's arid, potentially disastrous conditions on theHigh Plains.   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said the central part of the countryis ``blowing away'' but help is not forthcoming from Washingtonbecause of the Bush administration's slow pace in filling keypolicy jobs at USDA.   As of Feb. 28, more than 558,000 producers have receiveddisaster payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to morethan $2.7 billion, responded Milton Hertz of the AgricultureDepartment.   On the other hand, along a wide belt from Texas to Kentucky,moisture has been excessive in recent months, said AgricultureDepartment meteorologist Doug LeComte.   Despite some flooding, that moisture was badly needed in aregion that has suffered drought for several years, LeComte said.   He said the northern plains are in much better shape than lastyear, with snow and rain providing beneficial wetness for Montana,the Dakotas and the Great Lakes region this winter _ although somesubsoils remain dry.   Good snow and rains have also wetted down the Ohio Valley andwestern portions of the corn belt, said LeComte. ``The main springplanting areas were off to a pretty good start.''   California, especially Southern California, remains dry, saidLeComte.   He said moisture also remains a problem for the PacificNorthwest. Things are looking better, but the area still has a lotof rain to make up following three dry winters.   Miskus reports that despite recent improvements, SouthernCalifornia received less than half of the normal amount of rainfallbetween Dec. 1 and March 18.   Other regions with less than half of normal wetness for thewinter include most of New England and eastern New York state;parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Gulf Coast, southernFlorida, northern Florida and parts of Georgia and South Carolina;northern Missouri; southern Arizona and New Mexico; most of Kansasand parts of north Texas, northern New Mexico and western Oklahoma.</TEXT></DOC>
