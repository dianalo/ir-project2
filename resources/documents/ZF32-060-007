(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>At LTV Corp., we believe electronic mail facilitates a new kind of work, onethat allows users to crete and receive messages while in the midst of othertasks.andP;  Actual time spent in the e-mail process is usually negligible.andP;  Thus,messaging becomes an extension of the thinking process as opposed to theautomation of some process previously handled in some other way (likeface-to-face or telephone communications).andM;The many benefits of e-mail and the need to keep pace in a busy, competitiveworld have motivated LTV Aerospace andamp; Defense Co. (LTVAD) in Dallas to makesignificant investments in this technology.andP;  In deploying it, we are findingthat the following seven steps are contributing to a successful LTVADEnterprise E-Mail System.andM;1.andP;  E-Mail Plan.andP;  The first step was to develop a plan to move from multiple,independent 3-mail systems to a more integrated, enterprise system.andP;  Part ofthe LTVAD plan is to move from proprietary to standard e-mail protocols.andO;This was accomplished for external e-mail last fall when a bisynchronousgateway between our IBM Professional Office System (PROFS) mail system (laterupgraded to IBM's Office Vision/MVS) and ATandamp;T's Easylink mail service wasreplaced with an X.400/dedicated X.25 gateway from Wayne, Pa.-basedSoft-Switch Inc.andM;Another part of the plan was to simplify the LTVAD Enterprise E-MAil Systemby reducing the number of separate e-mail implementations from five to three.andO;The overall complexity of any e-mail implementation grows geometrically withthe number of proprietary systems, although this will not necessarily be thecase if those systems are X.400/X.500 compliant.andP;  The survivors at LTVAD arecc:MAil, IBM Office Vision/MVS and Digital Equipment Corp.'s All-In-1.andM;2.andP;  E-Mail Backbone.andP;  The second step was to establish an e-mail backbonethat can service the entire enterprise and link any subnets, such as DECnodes and Novell local area networks.andP;  Soft-Switch software was selected forthis task.andP;  Soft-Switch Central resides on an MVS host and serves as the hubfor four gateways to Office Vision, cc: Mail, X.400 and All-In-1.andM;3.andP;  Critical Mass.andP;  The third step was to attain a critical mass of e-mailusers within the company.andP;  This was done through an e-mail print service.andO;All employees who do not use Office Vision, All-In-1 or cc:Mail default toe-mail print and have their messages printed in the mail room and deliveredvia interoffice mail.andP;  Although e-mail print users do not enjoy most of theadvantages of true e-mail, their inclusion in the Enterprise E-Mail Systemrelieves the originator from having to know who uses e-mail and who doesn't.andM;Once all employees were established as e-mail users, they were then assignedX.400 addresses.andP;  This assignment was made in the Soft-Switch Central NamesDirectory, which accommodates X.400 addresses.andP;  At the same time, the LTVADEnterprise E-Mail System was established as a Private Mail Domain (PRMD).andM;To make the use of e-mail more appealing, fax, Telex and Easylink numberswere added to the central names directory.andP;  The Domain-Defined Attribute(DDA) field of the X.400 address was used for these numbers.andP;  Vendors that dobusiness with the Information Services Department are being encouraged tocommunicate via e-mail, preferably X.400, rather than by telephone and U.S.andO;mail.andM;4.andP;  Synchronized Directories.andP;  Like telephone systems, e-mail systems rely ongood directories to serve their customers.andP;  Directories must be current,accurate and complete.andP;  Where there is more than one e-mail system,directories must be synchronized across the systems so that they areconsistent.andP;  AT LTVAD each system (All-In-1, cc:Mail and OfficeVision) sendschanges to the central Soft-Switch Names Directory, which is then updated.andO;The changes are then sent to each e-mail system to update its directory.andM;At LTVAD, the Employee Information System, which is an IMS productiondatabase, is the primary source of employee data used to populate e-maildirectories.andP;  Additional information specific to e-amil is added as needed.andM;Like many other companies, LTVAD plans to migrate to X.500-compliantdirectories as they become available.andM;5.andP;  Intercompany E-Mail.andP;  Once a good internal 3-mail system is in place, thenext step is to provide an intercompany capability.andP;  LTVAD is one of eightaerospace companies that helped pioneer X.400 in the United States via theAerospace Industries Association X.400 Interconnect Pilot.andP;  An IBMPROFS-to-Easylink auto-dial connection provided the first X.400 capability.andO;That gateway was replaced in 1990 by a Soft-Switch X.400 gateway that has adedicated X.25 connection to Western Union 400.andM;Since most outside contacts do not yet use X.400, it is necessary toaccommodate other delivery services.andP;  This has been done by using the X.400DDA field for fax, Telex and Easylink numbers.andP;  This allows LTVAD e-mailusers to create messages on their native e-mail system and send them to anyX.400, fax, Telex or Easylink address, which must be registered in thecentral names directory.andP;  A planned in-line addressing capability will soonlet users put addresses directly into the body of their messages.andP;  this willbe especially beneficial for one-time or infrequent recipients.andM;6.andP;  E-mail Enabled Applications.andP;  Although historically e-mail has been usedprimarily for interpersonal messaging, its future must include conducting thebusiness transactions and moving the files that are the lifeblood of abusiness.andP;  Electronic mail should now be viewed as a store-and-forwardtransport system for moving electronic objects--documents, graphs,spreadsheets, forms, images, even voice.andP;  Furthermore, it must move theseobjects across a heterogeneous environment--from the central host computersto the PCs and Novell LANs, and across engineering workstations and DEC VAXminicomputers.andP;  It must also support the movement of objects between people,between people and computer applications and between computer applications.andM;At LTVAD, some of the early e-mail-enabled applications include directorymaintenance, directory queries and an EDI-over-X.400 pilot.andP;  Other plannedapplications include computer report distribution, electronic forms routingand custom news delivery.andM;7.andP;  Publicity.andP;  Finally, a key to establishing a successful enterprise e-mailsystem is good publicity.andP;  Potential e-mail users must become convinced ofits benefits through a proactive program of publicity, training and support.andM;At LTVAD, a booklet called LTVAD Enterprise E-Mail System was published anddistributed to more than 400 middle and senior managers.andP;  The booklet showsthe structure and capabilities of the e-mail system and provides a readyreference on all aspects of e-mail, including how to get support.andP;  It alsodescribes planned e-mail enhancements.andM;Classrooms training, on-line tutorials, help screens, e-mail items in variousin-house newsletters, seminars and hot line support round out the LTVADe-mail publicity and support program.andM;These are the seven steps that have worked for LTV Aerospace andamp; Defense.andP;  Inthe final analysis, of course, each company must develop its own ladder to asuccessful e-mail system.andM;Ronald G.
