The hijackers left Algiers for an unknown destination, accordingto sources in the Persian Gulf who spoke to The Associated Press oncondition of anonymity. The Kuwait News Agency said no deal wasmade with the hijackers except safe passage to Iran or Lebanon.   The Algerian government had mediated with the hijackers, who thehostages said numbered about eight but the Kuwait News Agency saidnumbered nine. The government and the hijackers said they reached asolution but did not say what it was.   The gunmen had killed two passengers since seizing the KuwaitAirways Boeing 747 on April 5. But Kuwait refused to bow to thehijacker's demand that 17 pro-Iranian terrorists imprisoned inKuwait be released.   Most of the 31 freed hostages were believed to be Kuwaiti,including three members of Kuwait's royal family. It was reportedpreviously that about 35 hostages were aboard the plane.   An official source in Kuwait, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Algerian Foreign Minister Taleb Ibrahimi promisedthe hijackers safe passage when he met with them aboard the planeon Tuesday.   A 31-year-old businessman, Tadar El-Kebi, said he saw thehijackers going through the plane trying to wipe off theirfingerprints shortly after 4 a.m. today.   ``This was the first indication I had that our release wasimminent,'' El-Kebi said.   The hijackers were whisked out of the jet at about 5:40 a.m.(12:40 a.m. EDT) and taken in unmarked cars to an undisclosedlocation, said Algerian officials who spoke on condition ofanonymity. The hostages were brought out about 20 minutes later.   Floodlights that had bathed the blue-and-white airliner nightlysince it landed here a week ago were turned off at 9 p.m. Tuesday,allegedly for a technical reason. They never came back on and thearea around the jet was dark, making it difficult for reporters todetect any movement.   Anware Al-Sabah and Ibtesam Al-Sabah, second cousins of Kuwait'semir and the only two women among the hostages, were the first todescend the gangway from the plane.   The women, wearing black veils, were escorted to a car and takento a hospital with their brother, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, who rodein an ambulance, a doctor said. The brother was suffering from anervous disorder.   The rest of the hostages boarded a white bus and cars and wavedto reporters on the tarmac as they were driven to the airport VIPlounge. The seven crew members and 21 passengers carried handluggage.   The men were unshaven, looked haggard and dazed and staredvacantly.   ``We lived in fear. We were very frayed. We had lost hope thatit would turn out this way,'' said Kuwaiti student Youssefal-Angeri, 24.   Passengers and crew said the hijackers always wore light bluehoods in their presence.   ``The worst moment was when they put a gun to a passenger'shead,'' said the plane's purser, Abdel Mon'em Mahmoud, an Egyptian.``Their eyes were sharp and expressionless like a shark.''   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, who led the mediation team,announced the release without giving details: ``A solution settlingall the issues of the hijacking has just been reached.''   Asked what would become of the hijackers, he said: ``That is aquestion which regards Algeria.''   The gunmen said in a statement in Arabic over the plane's radioat 4 a.m.: ``We declare to the Moslem people and people who seekfreedom today, on the third day of Ramadan, that we will end theKuwaiti airplane operation, giving our best regards to the Kuwaitipeople. We salute the offer made by the Algerian government.''   Ramadan, the Moslem holy month, started in Algeria on Monday.   The shades on the airplane's windows were raised for the firsttime since its arrival April 13 in Algiers, the third stop on anodyssey that began April 5 when the jet was seized on aBangkok-Kuwait flight with 112 people aboard.   The bodies of two Kuwaiti hostages, beaten and shot, were thrownoff the plane in Cyrpus, where the hijackers released 13 hostagesin exchange for fuel and the plane sat for five days before flyingto Algiers.   In Mashhad, Iran, the first stop, the hijackers released 57hostages. Freed hostages had said they believed additional gunmenboarded in Mashhad.   One of those released in Iran, Bert Watson of Guisborough,England, said he was ``immensely glad'' that the other hostages hadbeen freed.   But he said it would be a ``travesty'' if the hijackers wereallowed ``to quietly slip away from Algeria because it will end upwith them doing exactly the same again.''   ``These completely ruthless people should be locked up and thekey should be thrown away,'' he said. ``If I had my way they wouldbe hanged.''   The 17 pro-Iranian extremists whose freedom the hijackers soughtwere convicted in Kuwait for the December 1983 bombings of the U.S.and French embassies in Kuwait.   Western intelligence sources say they believe the hijacking'smastermind is Imad Mughniyeh, 36, one of four men indicted in theUnited States in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner during whicha U.S. Navy diver was killed.</TEXT></DOC>
