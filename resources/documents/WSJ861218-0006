Col. Oliver North's dealings with Nicaraguan rebels, and now three congressional committees are investigating whether senior agency officials tried to impede those efforts.    At least four months ago, department investigators in Miami were delving into connections between the fired White House aide and groups suspected of illegally shipping arms to anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua, law enforcement officials and congressional aides said.    The investigators also were pursuing leads indicating connections between Robert Owen, a former Senate aide with longstanding ties to some of the rebel groups, and allegedly illegal arms shipments to the Contras in 1985 from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and New Orleans, according to officials familiar with the case.    Senior department officials in Washington supervised some aspects of the South Florida gun-smuggling probe and received periodic briefings on its status from the field, law enforcement officials said.    As early as September, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, working with the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, interviewed witnesses about the activities of Lt. Col. North and Mr. Owen, said officials familiar with the case. A grand jury didn't begin hearing evidence in the case, however, until several weeks ago.    Now, congressional investigators are stepping up efforts to determine exactly what Attorney General Edwin Meese knew about the matter, and whether he or any of his aides may have tried to sidetrack or discourage FBI agents or prosecutors from pursuing the investigation.    Law enforcement officials said the investigation apparently didn't reveal diversion of profits from U.S. arms sales to Iran to Nicaraguan rebels. And it isn't clear whether Mr. Meese or his top aides were told specifically that Lt. Col. North, who had been a White House national security aide, was part of the continuing criminal investigation into gun smuggling.    Mr. Owen couldn't be reached for comment. At hearings before congressional committees, he and Lt. Col. North have invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.    Leon Kellner, the U.S. attorney in Miami, didn't confirm or deny that Lt. Col. North or Mr. Owen were part of the earlier investigation, but he did deny there was pressure from superiors to curb it. &quot;I was never told by anyone to slow down,&quot; he said in an interview.    Mr. Kellner said that if FBI agents asked questions about the two men, it &quot;wouldn't surprise me at all, considering some of the news reports&quot; and other information available to investigators at the time. Mr. Kellner said he authorized a full-scale investigation of suspected arms smuggling sometime in March and instructed prosecutors to &quot;go forward aggressively.&quot;    During the past nine months or so, Mr. Kellner said, he discussed the case several times with then Deputy Attorney General D. Lowell Jensen and had additional conversations about the matter with a number of other top-level Justice officials in Washington. Mr. Kellner said he recalled only one brief conversation in April with Mr. Meese about the investigation.    Congressional investigators have asked the department and the FBI for copies of any documents, memos or other material indicating Mr. Meese's role in this investigation. Investigators also are looking for documents indicating the attorney general's previously reported request at the end of October to delay a separate investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Customs Service of Southern Air Transport, a cargo airline suspected of shipping arms to the rebels and to Iran. </TEXT></DOC>
