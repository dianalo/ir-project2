Sun's new software, a $495 program called NeWSprint,breaks ground for Sun, because it allows the company'sworkstations to use a much broader range of printers thanbefore, including inexpensive dot-matrix machines andHewlett-Packard Co.'s popular ink-jet printers. Until now,Sun workstations could &quot;talk&quot; only to printers withsophisticated processing abilities built in.</LP><TEXT>   The software is part of Sun's two-year strategy ofincreasing its share of markets, such as corporate offices,that mainly use personal computers tied into networks. Sunhas cut prices of some of its machines to less than $5,000,bringing them to PC price ranges, and has persuaded softwarehouses, such as Lotus Development Corp., to adapt their PCsoftware to Sun's workstations.   But without a printer-software package such as NeWSprint,which includes fonts, or print typefaces, that are compatiblewith Adobe Systems Inc.'s PostScript, Sun's machines couldn'teasily be integrated into many personal-computer networks.&quot;As far as driving revenue and profit, it's not meaningful,&quot;Cliff Friedman, an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said. &quot;Butas far as their two-year goal, it's critical.&quot;   The new software is unique, because it places the&quot;intelligence&quot; necessary for printing -- the processing oftypefaces and graphics, for example -- in the computer,rather than in the printer. In a conventional scheme, thelaser printer contains the intelligence, which tends to slowdown the printing process.   Sun's new Sparcprinter, priced at $2,695, prints twice asfast as Sun's older, $6,400 LaserWriter. Analysts said thatthe printer isn't a threat to more entrenched laser printermakers, such as Hewlett-Packard, but that it will help Sundealers offer more attractively priced computer packages.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun sharesclosed at $27.75, up 50 cents, on volume of more than 1.4million shares.</TEXT></DOC>
