Jacobs (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TAXES </CO><IN> TNM </IN><TEXT>   By acting before year end, many small-business owners can avoid a heavy double tax when they sell their enterprises.    This is the last year transitional rules in the 1986 tax act exempt small corporations from being taxed on gains realized from the sale of certain assets or liquidation of the business. Only the shareholders are taxed when the proceeds are distributed to them. But after year end, both corporations and shareholders will be taxed.    &quot;If you look at how much a stockholder keeps and how much goes to Uncle Sam, it's worth avoiding the double tax,&quot; says Sam Davenport, a tax partner in the Pasadena, Calif., office of McGladrey andamp; Pullen, accountants.    Shareholders net 72 cents of every dollar, after paying Uncle Sam at the maximum individual rate of 28%. But they keep only 47.5 cents if the money is also subject to the top corporate rate of 34%. &quot;It's important to look at this if you are thinking of selling the business and retiring, because if you sell in 1989 vs. 1988, there is a significant difference,&quot; Mr. Davenport says.    The expiring rule only benefits small business. A 100% tax exemption is available to corporations valued at $5 million or less, and diminishes as the value increases, disappearing entirely for companies valued at more than $10 million.    However, owners needn't sell their businesses this year to avoid the double tax, says Robert Willens, a senior vice president at the securities firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. They can liquidate the corporation before the year ends, which has the same effect for tax purposes as a sale, and distribute the assets to the shareholders. &quot;You can continue to hold the assets personally or in a partnership,&quot; Mr. Willens says.    Liquidation is a tactic that must be considered carefully. It can trigger taxes on depreciable assets and inventory that wouldn't apply if the corporation continued to exist. And shareholders must put a value on the assets they receive to calculate the tax they owe: Such valuations are subject to question by the Internal Revenue Service. &quot;Liquidation is something that must be explored fully before it's done,&quot; Mr. Davenport says.    There is another way to prolong the exemption from double taxation: Make the company a so-called subchapter S corporation. S corporations normally are taxed like partnerships and don't pay corporate taxes. Their shareowners report corporate income on their individual returns. The double-taxation exemption is available to businesses if their S corporation status begins by 1989 and the company meets the $5 million valuation rule.    &quot;If you meet the $5 million criterion and you make an S election before the end of 1988, you can secure the exemption,&quot; Mr. Davenport says.    However, the double-taxation exemption doesn't apply to assets sold within the first three years of S corporation status. And businesses that use cash accounting (rather than accrual) may incur corporate taxes on inventory or accounts receivable. &quot;There are opportunities and problems with making S elections,&quot; Mr. Davenport says.    If owners can find someone to buy the stock of the corporation rather than just its assets, they can avoid the double tax problem, says Edward Mendlowitz, of the New York certified public accounting firm, Mendlowitz Weitsen, adding &quot;but you're not likely to find one.&quot;    Mr. Mendlowitz notes that buyers prefer to acquire a company's assets and not the corporation itself, which could subject them to unforeseen lawsuits and other liabilities. Buying the assets, also, provides a buyer tax benefits such as increased depreciation write-offs that aren't possible if the stock is acquired. </TEXT></DOC>
