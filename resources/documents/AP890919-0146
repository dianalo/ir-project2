Gorbachev on Tuesday won anopportunity to revamp the Communist Party by scheduling a partycongress next year that could hasten the pace of economic reformsand change the Kremlin leadership.   Gorbachev also made an emotional plea for calm among ethnicgroups in the increasingly restive Caucasus and Baltic republics.``We cannot allow anarchy, much less bloodshed,'' he said on statetelevision.   He also condemned secessionist movements in the Baltics andGeorgia, saying people demanding independence are ``demagogues.''   ``Currently, the work of party bodies and organizations is inmany ways fettered by old structures and outdated rules andinstructions,'' Gorbachev told the party's 251-member CentralCommittee, in obtaining its approval for moving up the date of theparty meeting to October 1990.   The congress, with 5,000 delegates, theoretically is the party'smost powerful body. It can set broad policy guidelines, and it isthe only body that can promote Communists to the Central Committee,which makes major decisions in the five years between congresses.   Historically, the congress also sets the five-year plan for theeconomy. By party rules, the next congress _ the 28th in the party'shistory _ must be held by early 1991. Moving up the date will allowGorbachev to make economic reforms sooner and to increase the numberof supporters on the Central Committee.   The move came at a closed meeting of the Central Committeededicated to solving the nation's ethnic disputes, which have led tomore than 200 deaths in the past 19 months and threaten Sovietstability and unity.   In remarks later shown on state television, Gorbachev saidnationalist disputes must be resolved peacefully. He rejecteddemands for boundary changes between the country's 15 republics. Hesaid such changes cannot solve conflicts when 60 million people, oralmost one-fifth of the Soviet population of 285 million, liveoutside their native territories.   Gorbachev also used the speech to denounce critics on both theright and left who assail his reform campaign, known as``perestroika'' or restructuring.   ``They are telling us that we can't solve the country's problemswithout moving to capitalism,'' he said. ``Another theme, comingfrom the right, is that everything we suggest, the policy ofperestroika, is an action the West succeeded in planting, in forcingon us. That's rubbish!''   The last party congress was held in February 1986, less than ayear after Gorbachev took power. He succeeded in replacing 41percent of the voting members of the Central Committee. Appointeesof former President Leonid I. Brezhnev, however, remained asignificant force.   In April, another 83 of the then 301 voting members resigned, anda number of candidate members were promoted to full membership,entitling them to vote on issues brought before the body.   The congress agenda approved Tuesday includes a report on theprogress of Gorbachev's economic, social and political reforms, areview of party rules and the election of new governing bodies _presumably including the Central Committee itself and the 12-memberPolitburo.   Gorbachev, 58, expressed concern that the party is lagging behindthe political reforms he has set in motion, including the shift ofmore power to elected government bodies. ``Real life, thereconstruction forces are going at such a rhythm that we oftencannot catch up with them,'' he said.   ``We cannot leave things as they are, especially sincefundamental economic and social processes are unfolding and anideological and political struggle is under way over key problems ofsocial development,'' Gorbachev said.   Some party stalwarts have said they fear the Communist Party,enshrined by the constitution as the country's ``leading force,'' islosing its grip on political power as the legislature grows strongerand frustrated citizens sometimes take matters into their own hands.   Gorbachev also said the party must adopt a new program and rules.A new program was adopted at the last Congress, replacing aKhrushchev-era document that had served for more than 20 years.   Ethnic disputes in many Soviet republics have disruptedGorbachev's drive to reform society. On the eve of the CentralCommittee meeting, Armenian activists appealed to Moscow to order anend to what they call an economic blockade imposed on their CaucasusMountain republic by neighboring Azerbaijan.   The official Tass news agency reported Tuesday that two policemanwere killed by a mob a day earlier in an Azerbaijani village on ablocked road to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave of therepublic. Armenia has claimed the region.   In Tashkent, Uzbekistan, a weekend ``Friendship Carnival''degenerated into mob violence that included a sexual assault on agirl in the subway and the siege of an Interior Ministry building,Tass said.   In the Baltic republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia,Communist officials have joined in varying degrees with informalpolitical movements that demand sovereignty from Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
