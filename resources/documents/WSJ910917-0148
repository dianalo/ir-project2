Traders are speculating that an early frost could causewidespread damage because many fields in that region aren'tmature enough to withstand cold weather. The growth of thecrops there is behind schedule because persistent rainsdelayed planting last spring by about a month.</LP><TEXT>   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybeancontract for November delivery jumped 11.75 cents a bushel tosettle at $6.09.   Prices of wheat futures contracts touched life-of-contracthighs during the session in the wake of the AgricultureDepartment's decision to make China eligible to buy anadditional two million metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat.   Since June 1, China had already committed to buy 4.5million metric tons of U.S. wheat. The new authorizationsignals that China will be a more significant importer ofU.S. wheat than the previous marketing year, in which itbought 3.8 million metric tons of U.S. wheat, according toRichard A. Loewy, president of AgResource Co., Chicago.   Under a program designed to boost U.S. farm exports, thedepartment compensates exporters that sell U.S. wheat at adiscount to certain nations.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soft redwinter wheat contract for September delivery settled at$3.2925 a bushel, up 6.25 cents.   Grain prices were also supported by signs that the Bushadministration is coming closer to making a decision abouthow to help the Soviet Union avoid a food shortage thiswinter.   A top Agriculture Department official has returned from afact-finding mission to the Soviet Union and grain tradersexpect the department to make some sort of food aidannouncement within the next few days.   &quot;Things are picking up steam,&quot; said Robert Lekberg, ananalyst at Farmers Grain andamp; Livestock Corp., Chicago.   Some private weather forecasters are predicting thattemperatures in southern Minnesota and northern Iowa couldfall to the freezing mark for the first time this growingseason by Thursday morning.   According to Peter Leavitt, a meteorologist at WeatherServices Corp., Bedford, Mass., temperatures in the areausually aren't that cold until Oct. 1 -- by which timesoybean and corn plants generally are fully mature and frostwon't damage their seed.   Because of the late growing season, however, some cropanalysts are speculating that roughly 10% of the corn cropand 25% of the soybean crop in the area is vulnerable tofrost damage.   This late in the season, a frost won't significantlyreduce the number of kernels produced by a corn plant. Butthe development of the kernels can be stopped -- resulting inwhat crop analysts call &quot;soft&quot; kernels that are unsuitablefor storage.   Soybean plants are the most vulnerable of the two crops toan early freeze this year because its growth rate is laggingfurther than corn. According to weekly field surveys releasedby farm states late yesterday, 36% of the Minnesota soybeancrop is mature, compared with a five-year average of 65%.   A soybean plant will die if it is exposed to temperaturesbelow 28 degrees Fahrenheit for more than two hours,according to some analysts.   The weekly state reports, which were released after theclose of trading, continued to show the impact of the summerdrought. Nationwide, 48% of the corn crop is in good toexcellent condition, compared with 76% for the year-earlierweek.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell. Copper for September deliveryended one cent a pound lower at $1.056; the actively tradedDecember contract dropped 1.2 cents to $1.0315. HerbertRhodes, manager of commercial metals services at ATandamp;T NetworkCable Systems, said prices declined on profit-takingyesterday. Spot prices had risen from under $1 in mid-Augustto $1.0750 last week. The profit-taking was probablytriggered by declining prices in London, which was caused bytechnical factors, Mr. Rhodes said. He also noted rumors thatthe London Metal Exchange would report increased copperinventories today, which would push combined stocks on theLondon Metal Exchange and New York's Commodity Exchange totheir highest level since March 1984, when prices were around68 cents. Richard Hirsch, vice president at Sharps Pixley inNew York, blamed the decline in prices on lackluster economicactivity in the major industrial nations. Although theservice and retail sectors of the U.S. economy are weak, themanufacturing sector, which uses copper, is doing relativelywell, as reflected in durable goods orders and otherstatistics, Mr. Hirsch noted. He said December prices shouldfind support at $1.02, but the premium of nearby copperprices over later deliveries indicates a tightness inimmediately available supply, and suggests that the recentupward price run may not be over.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices rose on prospects for cold weatherin certain cotton-growing areas of Texas. Cotton for Octoberdelivery rose 0.80 cent a pound to 64.35 cents; the activelytraded December contract rose 0.68 cent to 65.54 cents. PeterLeavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services Corp.,Bedford, Mass., said temperatures could fall to or even below40 degrees Fahrenheit in the Texas High Plains on Thursday,Friday and perhaps Saturday. Temperatures that low shock thecrop into dormancy and will delay it, he said. Ernest Simon,cotton specialist at Prudential Securities, said cotton needsheat and dry weather this time of year. Weather developmentswill have to be monitored closely through the harvest period,he said, adding that the Texas High Plains is one of the lastareas to harvest, usually in December.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices fell. Coffee for September deliveryended 1.25 cents a pound lower at 86.50 cents; the activelytraded December contract lost 1.90 cents to finish at 89.55cents. Arthur Stevenson, analyst at Prudential Securities,attributed the decline to expectations of improved weather inBrazil, and selling by funds based on technical factors latein the trading session. Mr. Leavitt of Weather Services saidthe rain in Brazil has been scattered and light and hasn'tbeen enough to relieve the drought conditions. He doesn'tforecast any showers through the end of the week.</TEXT></DOC>
