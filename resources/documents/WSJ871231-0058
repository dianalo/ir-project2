The transaction enables Pelican to absorb Gulf Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Metairie; First Financial of Louisiana Sandamp;L, Lutcher; Firstbank Federal of Gonzales; and First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Alexandria.    Gulf Federal, the largest of the four, held $453 million in assets in five offices. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had imposed new management on the thrift since Nov. 21, 1986.    First Federal had $167 million in assets and four offices. First Financial had $166 million in assets and eight offices. Insolvent Firstbank Federal, with $50 million in assets and three offices, was being operated by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. as its receiver.    The FSLIC said it will contribute $28.9 million and other financial benefits totaling about another $265 million. It will receive as much as 40% of Pelican's profits as well as warrants on at least 25% of Pelican's common stock when it converts to a stock company from a mutual association.    The acquisitions by Pelican, with $985 million in assets and 32 offices in Louisiana, bring to 44 the number of failing thrifts rescued or liquidated this year by the FSLIC.    Also yesterday, the Bank Board said the federal appeals court in Dallas upheld its authority to freeze the assets of six former officers and directors of a defunct thrift, Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association, Vernon, Texas. </TEXT></DOC>
