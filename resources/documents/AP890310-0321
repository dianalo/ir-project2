Coming in the wake of a series of stock market insider tradingscandals and controversial takeover battles, the proposed reformwould allow the Commission des Operations Bourse to initiate legalaction in French courts and hand out fines.   The commission currently has no enforcement powers of its own.   The bill was approved at the weekly meeting of governmentministers on Wednesday.   The measure would make takeover operations in France moretransparent, thereby protecting the interests of small shareholders.   An official government spokesman said the reform would ``makesure that the stock exchange did not become a jungle where the smallinvestor is at the mercy of the big operators.''   In a nationwide television interview last month, PresidentFrancois Mitterrand called for the ``moralization'' of Frenchfinancial markets and condemned stock market speculators.   The proposed legislation would give commission investigatorswider authority to examine suspected market irregularities, and makeit more difficult to launch takeover and partial bids in France.   However, it falls short of calls from political and financialcircles for the commission to be given the broad powers enjoyed bythe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   Under the proposed legislation, commission investigators would beable to carry out searches for incriminating material, but onlyunder the supervision of a judge and in the company of policeofficers.   The commission also would be empowered to block company bankaccounts, confiscate assets and temporarily suspend company activies.   The finance ministry said the reform would require an investor ora group of investors acting together to make a full bid for acompany once it controlled more than one-third of the shares orvoting rights of that company.   The change would prevent investors from building up excessivelylarge stakes in companies without making a bid for full control.   The executive council of the commission also would be increasedfrom five to eight members, four of whom will be chosed by top stateinstitututions. Two members would be selected by stock market andfutures market authorities. The last member would be a stock marketprofessional. The commission president would be named by the cabinetfor a six-year, nonrenewable term.   In recent months, France has been rocked by a series of insidertrading scandals and takeover battles that have forced theresignation of a top finance ministery official and implicated aclose associate of Mitterrand.   The need for the reforms were recently highlighted by thePechiney SA insider trading scandal. In November, the U.S. SECuncovered evidence of insider trading by French investors whoprofited from the acquisition by the French nationalized aluminumgroup of American National Can and the other packaging properties ofU.S.-based Triangle Industries Inc.   After judicial investigation, five of these French investors werechargd with insider trading offenses, including Roger-Patrice Pelat,70, a close friend of the Mitterrand's.   Pelat died of a heart attack Tuesday at the American Hospital ofParis.</TEXT></DOC>
