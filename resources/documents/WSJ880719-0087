The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had said it would seek cooperation from Switzerland in the alleged insider-trading scheme, which became publicly known at the end of June.    Swiss authorities had ordered the freezing of various accounts at that time, according to Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler. He declined to say which banks were involved and what the value of the assets frozen was.    The SEC request charges that business secrets were violated, which is illegal under Swiss law, Mr. Kistler said.    Switzerland's new insider trading law took effect July 1, but isn't applicable in this case because it involves transactions allegedly conducted before the law's effective date, Mr. Kistler said. </TEXT></DOC>
