Reagan gave Bush a terse statement of support Wednesday night,mispronouncing the name of his vice president at one point. ButBush aides quickly expressed enthusiasm for the endorsement.   At the White House today, Fitzwater said any reports that theendorsement was merely lukewarm were ``most unfortunate.'' He saidof Reagan, ``He is mortified. He thought the speech was terrific.He wrote it himself. He thought it was strong, a full endorsementof his vice president who he thinks incredibly highly of.''   Reagan delivered the long-awaited endorsement of his 1980 and1984 running mate at a Republican fund-raising dinner Wednesdaynight, telling his audience he would ``campaign as hard as I can''for Bush.   The president, bestowing his approval on Bush's campaign morethan two weeks after the vice president mathematically clinched theGOP nomination in the Pennsylvania primary, came in a brief threesentences at the conclusion of a 15-minute speech.   While Reagan's backing was never in doubt, the president hadstuck to a promise to remain netural as long as there were otherchallengers. Bush's remaining rival, Pat Robertson, announcedearlier Wednesday that he would support Bush.   During his speech, Reagan mentioned Bush only three times,mispronouncing his name on one of those occasions as ``GeorgeBosh.''   But Bush aides immediately stressed that they were pleased withReagan's announcement, no matter how brief.   ``It's a total endorsement,'' said Bush's chief of staff CraigFuller. ``I would not look for what wasn't said. I would look forwhat was said. I'm fully satisfied. I don't think it gets anybetter.''   Bush's press secretary, Stephen Hart, said ``it looks like anendorsement to me.''   ``These guys love each other,'' he added.   Speaking at a $1,500-a-plate banquet attended by more than 3,000Republicans, Reagan concluded a speech about the accomplishments ofhis administration with these words:   ``I intend to campaign as hard as I can. My candidate is aformer member of Congress, ambassador to China, ambassador to theUnited Nations, Director of the CIA and national chairman of theRepublican party. I'm going to work as hard as I can to make VicePresident George Bush the next president of the United States.''   In endorsing Bush, Reagan said he was breaking ``a silence I'vemaintained for some time with regard to the presidentialcandidates.''   Earlier in the speech, Reagan said: ``Eight years ago, GeorgeBush and I said to the American people, `the time is now.' It stillis. The story of America is one of people who have made theirdreams come true, by realizing that the time for action is alwaysnow.''   It was in that reference that Reagan mispronounced the name ofhis vice president.   Bush was traveling to New Mexico and California today for aseven-day campaign trip to the West.   Reagan's formal endorsement follows several weeks of jockeyingamong White House and Bush campaign aides over a time and place forthe announcement.   At the end of Reagan's speech, Bush and his wife Barbara workedtheir way through the crowd on the floor to join the president andFirst Lady Nancy Reagan at the podium. Reagan and Bush held claspedhands aloft as hundreds of balloons were released from the ceiling.   Bush, who spoke before Reagan, praised the president, saying:``You began a great national renewal.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, whose own presidential bidwas stopped in Bush's march to the GOP nomination, displayed hissometimes barbed wit.   ``Thank you, thank you very much,'' he said when he wasapplauded. ``I was going to say, I would accept the nomination, butI think it's already been spoken for.''   ``I can't remember the guy who got it,'' said Dole.   Robertson announced his suport for Bush after a private sessionbetween the two at the White House, claiming ``the race is prettymuch over.''   The former television minister has won only 46 delegates. Hesaid he would wait until Monday before formally withdrawing to givehis supporters a chance to win additional national convention seatsat GOP caucuses this weekend in Arizona and Virginia.   ``I didn't ask anything for myself. I spoke about education andthe need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of1988,'' Robertson said. ``We definitely had a meeting of the mindson the platform.''   Robertson's campaign later said in a statement that Robertsonhad said he was not withdrawing, but that he would address hiscampaign status on Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
