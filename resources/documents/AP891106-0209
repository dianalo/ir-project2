(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Daniel Manville's distinction in the legalcommunity stems from something he did long before he was admittedto the State Bar of Michigan. He served time for manslaughter.   Over the years, Manville's reputation has grown in a way stateofficials would just as soon forget _ his devotion to suing thestate on behalf of inmates and prison guards.   And the Detroit lawyer would like to start a law firm comprisedsolely of ex-offenders.   ``When I left prison I really had a jump. Hey, I was white andby then I had two bachelor's degrees,'' says Manville, who hiresex-cons as paralegals in his office.   ``It wasn't easy for me, but compared with other people I guessit was. I felt that something had to be done. I've always beensomeone who got involved in causes.''   Isn't there a rule against allowing felons to become lawyers?   ``As a constitutional matter, there's no offense a person cancommit that would forever preclude them from practicing law,'' saysDennis Path, chief investigator of the Michigan Bar.   ``The question we have to ask is are they rehabilitated? We'reconcerned about present good moral character. Manville demonstratedhe was likely to serve the public in a fair, open, honest manner.He's made all the right moves.''   Manville's conviction arose from a December 1972 drug-relatedslaying. Then a student at the Flint branch of the University ofMichigan, Manville, his brother and another student traveled toMount Pleasant to settle a score with a rival they believed hadstolen money and drugs from them. Manville used chloroform to knockout two men, and one of them died.   Manville, a natty dresser of 42 with a neatly trimmed beard, wasallowed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter instead of themurder charges on which he was indicted.   During his more than three years and four months in the StatePrison of Southern Michigan at Jackson, Manville completed hiscollege degree and earned a second. A fascination with the legalprofession led him to become a prolific jailhouse lawyer.   He obtained books that explained legal research and criminal lawin a nutshell. He experimented with other inmates' cases. His ownwas futile because he pleaded guilty.   ``There's a lot of demand,'' he says. ``But prisoners have avery short attention span. One day they're screaming to sue and thenext they forget all about it.''   After his 1976 parole, Manville's activities included workingfor the Head Start program for the disadvantaged in Lansing,interning at a Chicago program to combat racial bias, writing acouple of books, and then earning a master's degree in criminaljustice. In 1979, he enrolled in the now-defunct Antioch Law Schoolin Washington, D.C.   Manville's attorneys, stating his case for the admissions reviewboards for the bars in Michigan and in Washington, D.C., wereunable to cite another case in which someone became a lawyer afterkilling someone.   Manville waited several years before the panels approved him. Inthe interim, he worked for the American Civil Liberties Union'sNational Prison Project.   ``It's not easy. I'm not encouraging every ex-offender to doit,'' says Manville, who lives in downtown Detroit because he likesto be in the thick of city activity. He carries a load of about 70cases and is chairman of the bar's Prisons and CorrectionsCommittee. He recently was asked to make a presentation to alegislative committee.   State officials can name only four ex-felons who are practicinglaw in Michigan, two of whom prefer to keep their past in the past.The fourth, Georgia Manzie, was admitted to the Michigan Bar thisyear and said she wants to save her story for a book.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
