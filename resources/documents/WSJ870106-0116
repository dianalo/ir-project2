New York-based American International declined to specify the amount of the coverage, but did confirm that it provided property and casualty insurance for the Dupont Plaza. In San Juan, Bruce Shulman, the hotel's vice president for sales and marketing, also declined to give the amount of coverage. Mr. Shulman identified American International Insurance Co. of Puerto Rico, a unit of the insurance holding company, as the hotel's sole insurer.    Numerous lawsuits are expected to be filed against the hotel and other companies -- probably including various contractors and building-material suppliers -- in the wake of the New Year's Eve fire.    Lawyers and insurance industry professionals say it is too early to predict how the ultimate payments to victims might compare with the approximately $200 million distributed by various concerns as a result of a 1980 hotel catastrophe -- the fire at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev., that claimed 85 lives.    So far, little information is available about the ownership of the Dupont Plaza. Mr. Shulman said the hotel is owned by San Juan Dupont Plaza Corp., a closely held company based in Delaware. But he declined to identify the principals.    Mr. Shulman said Santa Monica, Calif.-based Hotel Systems International Inc. has been incorrectly identified as the hotel's owner in certain news accounts. He said that Hotel Systems, a reservation and information service that serves the Dupont Plaza, doesn't have any ownership stake in the hotel or San Juan Dupont Plaza Corp.    A similarity between the San Juan tragedy and the MGM Grand fire is the apparent speed with which smoke and fire spread. Because of that, according to Louis C. Bechtle, the federal judge who heard the consolidated MGM litigation in Las Vegas, there is likely to be a flurry of similar lawsuits alleging negligence by the hotel and defects in furnishings and building materials that contributed to the fire's spread.    &quot;That's where the battleground will be -- smoke spread and fire spread,&quot; Judge Bechtle said. He currently sits in federal court in Philadelphia.    All the fire-related lawsuits against MGM Grand Hotels were settled out of court with Judge Bechtle's encouragement. About half the settlement came from MGM Grand and its insurers and the rest from product suppliers, architects and contractors and their insurers, he said.    There were more than 100 defendants in the MGM litigation and in excess of 1,000 plaintiffs, including injured survivors. As a result, Judge Bechtle said, settlement is &quot;realistically the only way a mass disaster can be fairly and promptly resolved.&quot;    Stanley M. Chesley, a Cincinnati lawyer who represented some victims in the MGM litigation, said one factor that will influence settlement of any Dupont Plaza cases will be the number of serious burn injuries. Most survivors of the MGM Grand suffered from smoke inhalation rather than burns, he said. There appear to be more burn injuries in the Puerto Rico fire, although there are fewer total casualties. &quot;We have had burn cases where we obtained (individual) settlements of $3 million and $4 million,&quot; Mr. Chesley said.    Both Judge Bechtle and Mr. Chesley said the biggest difference between the two hotel fires -- that the Dupont Plaza fire appears to have been caused by arson -- is unlikely to affect any payout. While lawsuits would certainly name the arsonist, if identified, they said the cause of the fire will not substantially affect claims of negligence or defective products.    One insurance brokerage executive said that the Dupont Plaza fire has made some insurance companies more nervous about writing policies for hotels. &quot;There is not as much enthusiasm&quot; as a week ago, said Susan Whittet, an assistant vice president at Johnson andamp; Higgins, who has been working to complete January insurance renewals for a few large hotel companies.    Because hotel fires have long been recognized as a major risk, Ms. Whittet said she doesn't anticipate a long-term impact on the availability or pricing of hotel insurance. But she said insurers are certain to be asking more questions than before about the presence and location of safety features such as sprinklers.    ---   Also contributing to this article was David J.
