While many farmers will be forced into bankruptcy and some banks will fail, the Fed said that the drought isn't likely to create &quot;acute credit problems this year.&quot; But if the drought continues next year, the &quot;viability of many more banks&quot; will be in jeopardy, the Fed said in a report to Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) of the Senate Agriculture Committee.    The drought's impact on agricultural lending has been cushioned by several factors, the Fed said. Thanks to record-high income in 1986 and 1987, the nation's farmers have reduced their total debt by one-third, while the overall condition of farm banks has greatly improved. Crop insurance and disaster-relief payments from the government, meanwhile, will help offset the crop losses of hard-hit farmers, according to the Fed.    In a letter to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Sen. Leahy expressed concern that &quot;the storm is not over.&quot; Mr. Greenspan assured the senator that the Fed and other banking agencies will continue monitoring the credit and liquidity needs of farmers and farm banks. </TEXT></DOC>
