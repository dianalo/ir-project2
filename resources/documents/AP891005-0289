(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A private rocket wentup in flames during a launch attempt Thursday, ruining the firstAmerican booster designed and built solely with commercial funds,officials said.   ``Once the flames came out of the rocket, we kept waiting for itto lift off and didn't see it leave the pad,'' said Bob Angelotti,a spokesman for American Rocket Co.   ``People were saying, `It didn't take off! It didn't takeoff,''' he said. ``Then flame and black smoke began to come out ofthe bottom of the rocket cylinder.''   The 58-foot-tall rocket was to have taken a 15-minute suborbitalflight to test Star Wars missile detectors on a satellite orbitingoverhead, and to test a heat shield-parachute that might be used ona re-entry vehicle to help astronauts escape a space stationemergency.   The company said the rocket fell off the launch stand a fewminutes after it fizzled and burned.   The 58-foot-tall rocket was to have taken a 15-minute suborbitalflight to test Star Wars missile detectors on a satellite orbitingoverhead.   Thursday's failed launch was another blow to the Camarillo-basedcompany. Its founder, George Koopman, died in an automobileaccident July 19 while driving to a rocket test at Edwards AirForce Base. Koopman said earlier he wanted American Rocket ``to bethe Federal Express of the space business.''   American Rocket said its booster, dubbed the ``KoopmanExpress,'' was the first in the United States designed and builtonly with commercial funds, without any government subsidy orsurplus parts. Rockets used in other commercial launches this yearwere built under government programs although later sold forcommercial use, according to the company.   ``This is the rocket business, and this is why you do testflights,'' said Jim Bennett, president of American Rocket. ``It'snot at all uncommon for your first prototype to have a problem likethis. We'll be investigating and learning from it and go on.''   He said it probably will be next year before his companyattempts another launch. The company estimated this one cost $2million.   The launch had been scheduled during a two-minute windowbeginning at 10:28 a.m. PDT, but ``we lighted it up, and for onereason or the other it didn't lift off,'' Bennett said.   ``So we ordered the release clamps re-engaged and went into ourscrub procedure, but the vehicle caught on fire. ... The Air Forcesays there was minimal pad damage. ... But the vehicle isnon-flyable.''   The launch first had been planned Sept. 28, but was scrubbed byclouds and fear that lightning might hit the 33,400-pound rocket,which is powered by a hybrid engine that runs on a combination ofliquid oxygen and a solid fuel of polybutadiene rubber.   Thursday's launch was scheduled so the rocket could release acloud of inert gas as the Pentagon's Delta Star satellite passedoverhead.   The satellite, launched from in March, contains sensors thatsome day may be part of a Strategic Defense Initiative system _nicknamed Star Wars _ in which satellites would detect incomingenemy nuclear warheads so they could be destroyed.   Defense Department spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said earlierthat the Pentagon would not reveal whether the sensors detected theAmerican Rocket booster.   The rocket also was scheduled to deploy an engineering testmodel of an 8{-foot-wide ParaShield. It is a combined heat shieldand parachute that some day might be used in a new type of re-entryvehicle, such as an escape system to allow space station astronautsto return to Earth. The 390-pound model was built by students atthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</TEXT></DOC>
