(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA today cleared Discovery forflight, giving the go-ahead for a launch at 9:59 a.m. EDT Thursday.``It's been a long 2{ years,'' the space shuttle administrator saidas NASA workers prepared for the first U.S. manned mission sincethe Challenger tragedy.   Richard Truly briefed five anxious astronauts just minutes afterthe space agency's new launch directorate completed a pre-flightreview. Truly described the crew as ``elated to be heading forspace.''   Anticipation and tension rose across the NASA system as finalpreparations accelerated. ``Even the weather is looking good,''Truly said. ``The space shuttle is ready to fly,''   ``Right now, we see no constraints,'' NASA test director FrankMerlino said as the space agency said one nagging technical problemhad been resolved. ``We're looking forward to a good countdown anda safe launch.''   Robert Crippen, the veteran astronaut who has one-man authorityto approve or veto the long-awaited launch effort, supervised themeeting of NASA launch officials. The group gave its approval forshuttle fueling beginning late Wednesday night.   An equipment flaw that threatened to delay the launch wasresolved by engineers who worked through the night. Industrycontractors reported to Crippen today that the problem, involving adamaged O-ring on a rocket being prepared for a future shuttleflight, should have no impact on the Discovery mission.   A statement said the problem had been reviewed by all levels ofNASA management and that a similar rocket on Discovery had beencleared for flight.   Truly said, ``The payload is ready to fly.'' The payload is agigantic data-relay satellite, to be launched from the shuttle justsix hours after liftoff.   ``We have to be successful,'' said Kennedy Space Center'sdirector, Forrest McCartney, in reflecting on the Discovery launch.``The nation could not withstand another accident like Challenger.''   Discovery's crew _ Frederick H. Hauck, Richard O. Covey, GeorgeD. Nelson, John M. Lounge and David C. Hilmers _ planned aleisurely day today, receiving briefings on launch preparations andvisiting with their wives at crew quarters seven miles from thelaunch pad, 39B.   The technical question arose not with Discovery itself, but witha small satellite booster rocket being readied for a shuttle flightnext February. Scientists want to be certain a tiny cut found onone of its O-ring seals does not exist on a twin rocket whoselaunch is Discovery's main item of business.   The cut apparently was inflicted during installation and doesnot represent a design or manufacturing defect. To be certain, theyworked overnight checking documentation and pressure-testingdeliberately flawed rings.   Launch for the four-day flight is set for 9:59 a.m., with a2{-hour window that allows for weather or technical delays.   NASA officials said they'd done everything possible to make themission safe.   ``You can't totally take the risk out of something like this,''McCartney said in an interview. ``But in those last hours of thecount I'll know that we have done everything we know how to makethis a safe flight, that we have reduced the risks as much as wepossibly can.''   Asked what would be going through his mind as the count ticksdown, the center's deputy director, Tom Utsman, said, ``I'll besaying that hopefully we have done all the right things, that wehaven't taken any shortcuts, that we haven't overlooked anything.I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't nervous. But I also am confident.''   Though Thursday's forecast called for generally clear skies,with widely scattered showers, Crippen said Tuesday that thebiggest threat could come from surface winds prevalent here thistime of the year.   He said liftoff would be delayed if winds exceeded 19 mph fromthe south because they would cause stress on Discovery's aft skirt.A crosswind greater than 14 mph also would not be acceptable at theshuttle runway here in case the astronauts had to make an emergencylanding.   Crippen's launch directorate, made up of 21 National Aeronauticsand Space Administration and contractor engineers and managers, wascreated to overcome management problems that contributed to theJan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion that killed the seven crewmembers.   Crippen said the team's initial meeting Tuesday, which lastedseveral hours, provided an ``excellent review'' that revealed noproblems such as the ones that never were aired before top launchofficials prior to the Challenger disaster.   The nicked O-ring is used as a pressure seal in an inertialupper stage rocket needed to boost a communications satellite to ahigher orbit after it has been released by the astronauts from thecargo bay. It is not the same type of O-ring that failed and causedthe Challenger explosion.   The $100 million satellite and its rocket already had beentested and approved for flight aboard Discovery when the problemwas discovered Monday on similar hardware being readied for theFebruary launch.</TEXT></DOC>
