Since such sentiment is likely to cause heateddebate between various U.S. regions, the authors have developed a modelto quantify the annual regional effects of such tariffs for 1990. Theauthors have chosen gasoline for the analysis because of its importancein U.S. petroleum product markets and because such legislation was thefirst introduced. The analysis could, however, be done on other productsor crude oil and also discuss the likely implications of such tariffs.The authors do their analysis in a two good framework to capture outputsubstitution directly and use a spatial equilibrium model to captureregional effects. This model combines demand and supply equations alongwith transport costs for ten U.S. demand regions and eight supply regionsfor both gasoline and fuel oil to simulate regional changes in oil productflows, prices, consumer surplus, producer surplus, and employment inresponse to alternative tariff increases.</TEXT></DOC>
