(products).andO;Topic:     New ProductMonitorsTest EquipmentEquipment AcquisitionTelecommunications.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>INTERESTING NEW THINGSandM;A lot of the energy and creativity in the monitoring and test industry hasbeen spent recently not on new products, but on mergers and acquisitions.andM;Michael Bitterman, VP of sales and marketing at Digilog Network Control, putit bluntly: &quot;Everyone is merging because you can't make a go at it just onthe voice side.andP;  You need both voice and data to complement each other.&quot;andM;Bitterman's own company, Network Control, was acquired by Digilog, theMontgomeryville, PA, maker of data test and management systems, on November29 of last year.andP;  Other consummations include the merger last summer of DDIBuscom into Metro Tel, and Case with Datatel who merged on September 16,1988.andM;An alternative to corporate death is an aggressive expansion of one's productline.andP;  CSE/Berry accomplished this in one fell swoop when they recentlypurchased Advent's product line.andM;But despite all of the confusing recombining of companies, we were still ableto spot some of the more interesting new test equipment out there:andM;Atlantic Research'sandM;Interview 20andM;The new Interview 20 is a powerful, hand-held multifunction data tester.andO;It's like 10-test instruments in one compact, portable unit.andP;  These testinstruments include a data-line monitor, protocol analyzer/emulator, RS-232breakout box, bit-error tester, digital volt/ohm meter, dB level meter, asyncterminal, continuity tester, power-line monitor and programmable-alarmmonitor.andM;It's for field-service personnel, data-communications technicians,installation crews and communications users.andP;  The unit lets you servicecomputers, networks, terminals, peripherals, modems, multiplexers andtransmission links.andM;The Interview 20 has data rates up to 256 Kbps, 128 Kbps BERT/BLERT, advancedgraphic-lead status, baud-rate frequency counter, remote control, autoconfigure, 128K nonvolatile RAM and VT100 terminal.andM;Anritsu's AnalyserandM;Anritsu is the Japanese giant in fiber optics.andP;  Their Spectrum AnalyserMS2601A was introduced in April '88 and is suitable for both voice and data.andO;It's part of their full series of spectrum analyzers.andP;  They have, at lastcount, 10 different ones.andM;The MS2601A is portable and has a built-in pre-selector and memory.andP;  It doesspectrum analysis and measures field-strength and time-domain analysis in thezero-span mode.andP;  Its memory cards are plug-in.andP;  It also has a zone-marker andzone-sweep function.andM;Like all Anritzu products, it's available direct and through Anritsu reps.andM;Beckman's Easy BOB 785andM;It's not exactly new, but we couldn't restrain ourselves from talking aboutit.andP;  The Easy BOB 785 is a battery-powered, 100-LED breakout box andfull-function cable tester in one hand-held device.andM;The 785 BOB has 50 red and green rectangular LEDs to monitor all possibleRS-232C signal states and has a mess of jacks and jumpers to setup anydesired configuration.andP;  Plus and minus faceplate output-voltage pins areavailable to simulate the presence of control signals.andP;  The built-in pulsetrapper, with its own reset button, traps transient signals as short as twomicroseconds in duration.andM;As a cable tester, the 785 simultaneously sends and receives test voltages,with two test modes for automatic line-by-line testing.andP;  It can also testeach line separately.andP;  It lists for $345.andM;CSE/Berry ThingsandM;As already mentioned, CSE recently purchased Advent's product line, includingtheir line of DS-1 testers.andP;  One of our favorites is the DS-1 Channel Accesstest set with rack-mounted dual drop-and-insert capability.andM;The thing can be remotely controlled in any operational mode and it detectsand accumulates frame slips and other glitches in DS-1 transmission.andP;  Thereis also a 115 VAC operation option and an Actibus option.andM;Then there's everybody's favorite, the Transmission Test Set.andP;  This portable,remote-controlled, battery-powered device has test capabilities ranging fromimpulse noise to return.andP;  It's the kind of powerful device that can make amediocre repairman a supeman.andM;Datatran's AutofoxandM;Datatran says they've come up with a revolutionary new thing in the Autofox.andO;They describe their Autofox more as a protocol analyzer or data-line tester,yet it's only a fifth of the size of the usual beast.andP;  Furthermore, the thingis supposed to be so easy to use that even a TELECONNECT writer or editor canperform complex tests with it.andM;Pretty strong language.andM;The Autofox is simply a fox-box and BERT-tester that analyzes data from botha serial and parallel interface.andP;  It can also receive and generate data, testit, exercise it, analyze it and convert it.andM;The Autofox is a new product for technicians by technicians.andP;  It picks upwhere a breakout box leaves off.andP;  While a breakout box concerns itself withyour wiring/cabling problems, the Autofox focuses on the content oftransmission.andP;  It gives you the critical details of the transmission.andM;The Autofox is also an emulator device.andP;  It transmits data to a printer,another computer, etc., so you can see if the connections are workingcorrectly.andP;  And all of this is available for under $500.andM;Digilog's UpgradesandM;Interesting things are expected out of this new corporate entity (Digilog,the Montgomeryville, PA, maker of data test and management systems, acquiredNetwork Control last November).andM;For instance, Digilog's Channel Access Unit (CAU) is being interfaced withNetwork Control's Janis through an RS-232 connector.andP;  The result?andP;  Itprovides for remote alarm notification of all T-1 conditions to your networkcontrol center.andM;No doubt you'll be glad to know that Network Control's Janis software nowprovides new management reports and has an automated trouble-tracking system.andO;The Janis has also been out-fitted with post-dial delay measurement so userscan figure out how long a telephone call takes to get across the network.andP;  Werecommend the new Janis for anyone in a virtual network environment.andM;Harris/Dracon'sandM;ISDN TesterandM;This product is brand-spanking new.andP;  It looks sort of like a transistor radioand debuted last November at NATA.andP;  It was the talk of the show.andM;Not suprising.andP;  For this is the industry's first hand-held ISDN test set.andP;  Itallows you to find the basic trouble on the ISDN line without having tointerpret the complex ISDN protocols.andP;  You don't even need to know what anISDN protocol is to use this gadget successfully!andP;  Thank the Lord.andM;It works in all ISDN environments and in either a passive bus or apoint-to-point configuration.andM;If the line fails the test, the thing lets you isolate the problem.andP;  It looksfor the specific bug.andP;  For instance, the twisted-pair wire might betransposed, there might be improper line impedance or the receiving pairmight be off whack.andP;  Whatever it is, this will smoke it out.andM;Keptel's GOLD SystemandM;Keptel introduced the Gold -- Guaranteed Open Loop Detection system -- lastChristmas.andP;  And if you didn't find this product under the tree on the 25th,listen up.andP;  You might want to run right out and get one.andM;It makes your house an impenetrable fortress.andP;  If some one breaks and entersand cuts the phone line to short circuit the alarm, he's as good as caught.andO;For this device immediately sends a signal to the alarm company if the loopis broken.andM;It's accomplished because the thing sends a constant frequency to the CO.andO;The CO is made aware the moment the stream is interrupted.andP;  This allows thealarm company to sell a more secure system.andM;The Gold system consists of two advanced electronic elements.andP;  The first is aCO-based scanning center designed to serve up to 950 subscribers (with up toeight different alarm companies per system).andP;  The second element is a modulemounted at the customer's premise which places a continuous subaudible toneon the lines being monitored.andP;  A cut line interrupts the tone and is reportedby the scanning center to the alarm company.andM;The system can also be used to monitor other lines where continuous serviceis critical.andP;  It can be helpful, for example, in monitoring financialtransaction lines, payphone lines and medical emergency or 911.andM;Metro Tel's LoopbackandM;TesterandM;Metro Tel started shipping these last summer.andP;  It tells you everything thatone of those gadgets on a repairman's butt set tells you, except that theRT-1 Loopback Test Set is installed at the demarcation point and worksremotely.andP;  Thus, it eliminates the need for onsite visits.andP;  Remoteidentification of trouble in the CPE or the CO loop can be a real-time moneysaver.andM;The remote access is accomplished through DTMF.andP;  It seizes the line andestablishes a talk path, draws a dial tone, dials out in tone or pulse,checks for ringing and program operation functions, tests operating functionsand disconnects the line.andM;Other remote functions include programming the on-site sets and asking forthe number of times the test or programming modes were used.andM;It has security-access protection.andP;  Each unit services up to eight lines andup to seven units can be linked together at the demarc to service up to 56lines.andP;  Installation requires one RJ-31X per incoming line with one AC powersupply for the system.andP;  Operating instruction are in nonvolatile memory andduring power failure calls are passed through to the CPE.andP;  Diagnostic testscan also check the internal functions of the RTS-1.andM;The RTS-1 measures 10&quot; x 8&quot; x 1.5&quot; and weighs only two lbs.andP;  Trade price forthe master unite is $395 ($295 for each expansion unit).andM;Nicollet's Hand-HeldandM;Test SetsandM;Nicollet introduced the 4200 and 5200 Hand-Held Test Sets last fall.andP;  The4200 is a neat device.andP;  It has many signalling and supervision formats.andP;  Forexample, it can work in a DID link or DOD link start for a normal loopenvironment.andP;  That means it feeds the battery into the CO and handles thesupervision as the PBX does.andP;  It will also simulate the CO's DOD mode.andP;  It'sjust as comfortable signaling dial pulse, DTMF, MF and following callprogress formats.andM;The 4200 has digit and wink analysis (that means it analyzes digit-timingparameters and wink-timing parameters).andM;The 5200 is one package, but does a bunch of popular tests.andP;  In its simplestuses, it acts as a butt-in device.andP;  Other features include a volt and currentmeter for the telecom room.andP;  It has measurement capabilities for C messagenoise, three KHz noise and DBM level.andP;  It has a dial generator and receiverand indicates normal reverse and acts as a handsfree speaker phone.andM;Northeast Innovations'andM;CO SimulatorandM;The 1040A was introduced about a year ago and has already been verysuccessful.andP;  More than 1,000 are now out in the field.andP;  One interestingapplication involves sales people demonstrating whatever type of telecomdevice without tying up the prospect's phone.andP;  And the devices can mean realsavings at trade shows since outside lines go for about $600 for a typicalthree-day show and this bos has a one time price of $395!andM;The 1040 allows you to pretend you have two phones.andP;  You can talk betweenthem.andP;  Functions include dialing, ringing, touchtone and rotary dialing,diagnostic tests and special information tones (SIT tones).andM;Lights and jacks indicate offhook and ringing for each line.andP;  The jack on thefront lets the user load anything he wants onto the talking path.andP;  Forexample, they let you hook up an oscilloscope to see what's there.andP;  The 1040Ais available direct from Northeast Innovations.andM;Reliance Comm/Tec'sandM;T-AnalystandM;The T-Analyst is the most comprehensive T-1 tester for your money, saysWarner McKinsey, the product's manager.andP;  The BOCs have gone crazy over itsince it was introduced last summer.andM;It's both a DS-1 generator and receiver.andP;  It supports both directions.andP;  It'salso got a full DS-1 path, going both east and west for the full circuit.andP;  Itcomes with complete remote access through a RS-232 modem connection.andM;The T-Analyst is user friendly with a complete LCD output for setup menu andperformance.andP;  It also includes a printer interface.andP;  There are very few othertesters with all of these input and output capabilities.andM;It can do full drop-and-insert testing when placed in series with the DS-1line to be tested.andP;  Therefore, it breaks down the DS-1 line into selectedDS-0 channels without disturbing the other lines, serving as sort of a digitbutt-set for VF testing.andM;At $3,950 per unit, it's quite reasonably priced, considering everything itdoes.andM;3M Dynatel's SystemandM;3M's recently introduced VenCat 3100 is a bulk-performance monitoring systemfor DS-3 signaling.andP;  This system makes a non-intrusive connection to DS-3circuits and stores erred seconds, severely erred seconds, unavailableseconds, blue signal seconds, frame and parity bit errors, percent erredseconds, percent severely erred seconds, percent unavailable seconds andpercent error free seconds.andM;Threshold levels ring alarms when things go bad.andP;  They are set by the user.andO;Each shelf accommodates from one to 36 DS-3 signals.andM;Remember, carriers guarantee error-free service.andP;  This allows you to measuretheir performance and assure accuracy.andP;  This is heavy stuff...and expensive.andO;If you're paying for it you want to make sure you're getting it.andP;  MCI, we'retold, has bought a bunch of them and is thoroughly satisfied.andM;The VenCat 3100 is rack mounted and available direct from 3M.andM;And let's not forget 3M's portable test set, the VenCat 3400, also a DS-3system analyzer.andP;  After the above device has indicated a problem, thisportable instrument isolates the trouble.andP;  The two units work hand-and-hand.andM;Tekelec's T-1 TesterandM;The Chameleon 800 is Tekelec's newest T-1 transmission-test system.andP;  It wasintroduced last fall at TCA.andP;  It's portable and lightweight and does a bunchof network monitoring, diagnostics, field maintenance and repair things.andM;This product offers comprehensive digital testing from DS-0 to DS-3 andanalog testing within a DS-0 channel.andP;  The new test system is available insingle- or dual-transmitter/receiver configurations.andP;  This means moreflexibility (you can test two DS-1 lines or monitor a network center).andM;Extensive built-in help facilities and a unique CRT/softkey-driven &quot;humaninterface&quot; make the 8000 easy-to-use.andP;  The test system, in fact,autoconfigures to line code and formats for instant use.andP;  It measures allDS-1 performances including individual errors, bit-error ratios, erroredseconds, severely errored seconds, degraded minutes and severely erroredframes.andP;  A built-in printer provides instant screen printouts for detailedreports.andM;The Chameleon 8000 is a modular and expandable unit.andP;  It uses the NuBus, apopular bus interface designed for high-performance applications.andM;Tektronix's Cable TesterandM;Tektronix's new 1500B Series of metallic cable testers is already a year old.andO;It has, so far, been phenomenally successful.andM;The 1502B and 1503B Metallic TDR Cable Testers make fault finding fortelephones, LANs, CATV, power and general cables easier, faster and moreaccurate.andM;The 1502B delivers a .9-inch resolution between two faults and staticsuppression to protect the instrument against static blowouts resulting inreduced annual-maintenance requirements.andP;  Designed for use when highresolution is critical, the 1502B also features a continuous screen displayeliminating the need for time-consuming calculations.andM;For long-distance applications, the 1503B delivers a two-nanosecond pulse andresolution to less than one foot, providing over five times the resolution ofearlier tester generations.andP;  Built to provide superb long-distanceperformance for LAN, telephone industry and CATV applications, it delivershigh resolution and fast fault finding up to a 50,000-foot range for anygeneral metallic cable application.andM;Both of these devices offer such features as LCD display, optional internalprinter, menu-driven help program, built-in memory and digital averaging.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
