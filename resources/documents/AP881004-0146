Trujillo is in charge of internal security in Colombia.   Last month, the president offered a cease-fire, negotiations,pardons to guerrillas who surrendered and a chance for rebelleaders to speak before congress.   All six of Colombia's leftist guerrilla groups rejected the plan.   Gaviria was particularly critical of the country's largestguerrilla group, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, known byits Spanish acronym as the FARC.   FARC attacks killed 12 soldiers, six policemen and threecivilians on Sunday and Monday, the Defense Ministry said.   ``The government authorizes full institutional support for thearmed forces to confront the guerrillas, because weakness orcomplacency doesn't result in peace,'' Gaviria said in an interviewwith the Bogota radio station Caracol.   Justice Minister Guillermo Plazas said the guerrillas' answer to``the olive branch offered by President Barco has been attacks onthe army, blowing up of pipelines and setting off bombs.''   The FARC has used a cease-fire during the last four years ``tocheat the government'' by increasing its strength, Plazas said in abroadcast interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.   Leftist guerrillas have been fighting the government since 1960.   The FARC signed a truce with the government of former PresidentBelisario Betancur four years ago. There has been sporadic fightingbetween the FARC and government security forces during the truce.   Another guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, has blownup the country's main oil pipeline 85 times in the last two years.   On Saturday, the guerrilla group blew up the pipeline, whichcarries 225,000 barrels of oil a day from the Canon Limon field inthe northeast state of Arauca.   On Sept. 28, the National Liberation Army set off a bomb inBogota as the car of a Texaco executive passed by. The executive,John Buttle, a Canadian, was not injured.   In July, the National Liberation Army kidnapped the owner ofGeneral Pipe Co., of Houston, Jake Gambini. There has been no wordon Gambini's fate.</TEXT></DOC>
