He and his two fellow People With Boxes On Their Heads were justthree of the ... well ... interesting folks hanging around thecity's official demonstration zone _ actually a two-acre blacktopparking lot _ on Tuesday, during Day 2 of the convention.   When asked where the People With Boxes On Their Heads werebased, the Guy With A Box On His Head replied, ``Here.''   When asked what he stood for, Guy replied, ``Nothing.''   And when asked why he had a box on his head, he replied,``That's the name of our organization, dammit!''   But they don't like to be called ``Boxheads'' because theyconsider it a racial slur, Guy said.   A cynic suspected he was actually a journalist who had been inthe sun too long. He wore a distinctive chain and plastic poucharound his neck, used by journalists, delegates and staff to carrycredentials for the convention. However, where his credentialshould have been was the plastic card from his hotel door: ``PLEASEMAKE UP ROOM NOW.''   Later into the demonstration zone came Pastor Edgar Mallett ofthe Prayer andamp; Faith Church Of The First Born in Chicago, acclaimed _at least on the sign he carried _ as ``The World's GreatestDemonstrator For 16 Years.''   Mallett, 71, who campaigned for president in 1972 toting ``theweight of the world'' in a weighted sack over his shoulder, saidhe's running again ``to save the country. God told me we're gonnalose it.''   Mallett believes that for America and the world to be saved, wemust have two presidents.   ``If we have a president from Mars, still we must have two.That's my motto,'' he said.   Just outside the convention zone stood another minister, streetpreacher Dan Martino of Chattanooga, Tenn. Martino stood for hoursin the hot sun at a corner near the convention center, wearing agrey suit and black wing tips and holding the sign that got him alot of attention: ``GOD IS A REPUBLICAN!''   ``I'm here trying to help the Democrats to think,'' he said.   Religion, however, took a beating from former Connecticut statelegislator Thomas Supina Jr. of Ashford, Conn., who stood on thesidewalk in front of the Omni Hotel, next door to the arena,distributing copies of a letter he has sent to U.S. Surgeon GeneralC. Everett Koop.   Supina, 82, is asking Koop to declare that ``religion is anaddictive drug'' and that living according to the preachings ofmost ministries ``could be dangerous to your health.''   In his letter, Supina says TV preachers Jimmy Swaggart, JimBakker, Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are``disturbing the peace, the tranquility and the well being ofpeople everywhere.''   Later, back inside the demonstration area, poet Deacon Lunchboxof Atlanta, a big man with a long red beard and a small red cap,took the stage with several ``left-wing poems of the day.''   ``Terrorism,'' one was called. It's about Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi:   ``He likes to pray in the desert in his wrap-around shades,   ``When he ain't causing trouble, he likes to have parades.''   But neither the Guy With A Box On His Head, Pastor Mallett,preacher Martino, the former Connecticut legislator or the deaconof left-wing poetry attracted the media attention enjoyed byFranklin Burke of Los Angeles, who has apparently become theOfficial Character of the 1988 Democratic Convention.   Looking just a bit like a wayward Uncle Sam, wearingred-and-black checked slacks, a U.S. flag vest, a Dukakis sign anda Dukakis hat, Burke has stood in the demonstration area each daysince Sunday. He waves a U.S. flag with a blue plastic bird tackedto the top _ and its wings, if he jumps around enough, really move.   ``Bird!'' he cries, jumping up and down to make the wings work.``There it goes! Up in the air!''   ``I'm here to have a good time, meet the delegates, see all thepeople, join in the celebration,'' he said.   He was certainly meeting a lot of journalists. How many of the13,000 covering the convention had he talked with by Tuesday?   ``About 12,000,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
