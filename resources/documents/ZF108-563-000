 Taking advantage ofPresentation Manager's graphical user interface and OS/2'smultitasking capabilities, programs such as PageMaker fromMicrosoft and DeScribe from Describe Inc are pushing theboundaries of desktop publishing.andP;  Other OS/2 programs will be outsoon, and many will take advantage of multitasking functions thatallow users to print, format, or flow text in the background whileworking in a separate application.andP;  Desktop publishers consideringthe switch to the more powerful world of OS/2 need to make prudenthardware decisions as well, taking into account memory needs andextra peripherals.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Desktop publishingOperating SystemsOS-2Software Selection.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Presentation Manager: The Future of Desktop Publishing Is Here Desktoppublishing applications for the PC could never have been developed without agraphical user interface (GUI) such as Windows or GEM.andP;  Today, however, theOS/2 Presentation Manager offers even greater power and functionality, andpublishing applications are casting aside the DOS GIUs that made thempossible and are migrating to the new platform.andP;  Ironcially, these verypublishing applications are themselves now foundation blocks upon which thesuccess of OS/2 and Presentation Manager is being built.andM;The irony intensifies when you consider where desktop publishing earned itswings.andP;  That was of course, on the Macintosh, a machine derided for years by&quot;blue-blooded&quot; PC users for using exactly the kind of software that inspireddesktop publishing.andP;  These once low-caste Mac applications are now playing acritical role in the future of the operating system that will humbleonce-proud DOS.andM;Amusing as these turnabouts may be, the strategic minds at Microsoft see morein them than entertainment value.andP;  Alive to the importance of desktoppublishing, in 1989 Microsoft created the first (and only) vertical nichewithin its PM development area, a niche devoted exclusively to nurturing andevangelizing desktop publishing in the Presentation Manager environment.andO;Headed by Linda Archer, this special unit provides publishing-related PMdevelopers with unstinting support in answering and channeling technical andpromotional questions.andP;  The very existence of such a group is also a reply tocritics who have questioned Microsoft's commitment to OS/2 and PM.andP;  So nowthe only question remaining is whether you're ready to commit to OS/2 and PM.andM;To help you decide, the sidebar &quot;Desktop Publishing Hardware,&quot; will give youan idea of what--at current New York street prices--desktop publishing in thenew environment will cost.andP;  A minimally configured system built to run a PMdesktop publishing application can be had for as little as $7,500.andP;  Thiswould include a 25-MHz 386 clone, 4MB of RAM, a 40MB hard disk drive, aninexpensive color VGA monitor and card, a mouse, OS/2, PageMaker, a wordprocessor, and an economy-class PostScript-compatible printer and cables.andM;If you're not technically proficient with hardware and software, however,you'd probably better stay with quality name brands.andP;  In this case, plan ondoubling the no-frills price.andP;  One component not to economize on is memory.andO;Although it is possible to run OS/2 with less than 4MB of RAM, noone--including Microsoft--recommends that you try.andP;  Indeede, OS/2 2.0 isexpected to force up the recommended RAM to 6MB.andP;  However, it will also beginto allow real-mode applications to interact with those running inprotected-mode; Windows, previously restricted to the limited DOScompatibility box of OS/2 1.2, is expected to get its first real view of PM;and Version 2.0 promises to be far more hospitable to other important systemresources.andM;Most of us have seen not only the time and cost benefits, but also the addedcreativity that investments in desktop publishing have made possible in thepast.andP;  The question facing desktop publishers now is whether OS/2 andPresentation Manager will provide sufficient additional benefits to justifyadditional expenditures.andM;PAGEMAKER PMandM;For some PageMaker users, the increased speed of the new PageMaker for thePresentation Manager (hereafter PageMaker PM) is reason enough to make theswitch from the Windows version.andP;  Corporate user I've asked tend to justifythe purchase of PageMaker in the OS/2 PM environment even when it meansupgrading to something like an IBM PS/2 model 70 with 4MB of RAM.andM;PageMaker PM's overall performance improvement is not limited to the virtuesconferred by being able to use abundant memory.andP;  The product alsoincorporates some impressive multitasking capabilities that speed throughputand that are only possible under OS/2.andP;  (Even Windows 3.0 will not be able toprovide the true multitasking facilities needed for background operations.)andO;Text autoflow, for example, is a PageMaker function that, under PM, canoperate transparently in the background.andP;  This means that while text isflowing you can go on working, either in the same publication, in anothersimultaneously open publication (a new feature of PageMaker PM), or even inanother application outside PageMaker altogether.andP;  The same backgroundfunctionality can also be employed when printing or reformating.andM;There are other minor but useful enhancements in PageMaker PM, such as anintelligent ASCII import facility with several options that go beyond merelystripping off line-ending returns.andP;  For instance, a Lotus .PRN file can nowbe imported with the spaces between its columns automatically replaced bytabs.andP;  (Regrettably, however, PageMaker still does not provide the option ofdisplaying tabs, returns and other nonprinting characters on the screen.)andM;One disappointment I experienced while using PageMaker PM as an inability touse the clipboard to import Microsoft Excel charts in metafile format.andP;  Thereason points to the kind of difficulty to be expected in a rapidlydeveloping field.andP;  PageMaker PM was one of the first PM products to ship, soAldus had to write it to OS/2 1.1 specifications.andP;  Between OS/2 1.1 and OS/21.2, however, the metafile format (among other things) was changeg.andP;  ExcelPM, written directly for OS/2 1.2, conforms to the newer, different metafileformat.andM;Thus, PageMaker PM can't read Excel's metafiles until its own program isupgraded.andP;  In the meantime, however, you can copy an Excel PM chart as abitmap file (use Shift, Edit, Copy Picture).andP;  The bitmap so generated willrequire a fair amount of available system memory or enough available diskspace for caching.andP;  In general, Aldus recommends you keep at least 5MB ofdisk space free for all PageMaker caching requirements.andP;  (If your drive ispartitioned and has larger amounts of free memory on a drive other than C:,you'll want to amend the SWAPPATH statement in the CONFIG.SYS file to use itfor caching.andP;  Aldus also recommends increasing the OS/2 SWAPPATH default of512K to 2.5MB.)andM;The lack of adequate and functional printer drivers in that early version ofOS/2 is another example of the limitations Aldus faced.andP;  The early beta andfirst-release customers have simply adjusted to other output alternatives,such as printing publications to disk en route to printers, judging this tobe a fair trade-off for the increased speed and background functionality ofPageMaker PM.andP;  Fortunately, OS/2 1,2 offers much better printer support andrequires little or no vendor intervention to upgrade this area.andM;DDE AND OTHER FEATURESandM;Not all OS/2 and PM enhancements are so easy for developers to handle,however.andP;  One of PM's most valued features, Dynamic Data Exchange, forexample, will remain absent from many first-generation PM products--includingPageMaker and Ventura Publisher.andP;  (The latter is about to go into betatesting at the time of this writing.)andP;  Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) involvesthe ability to create live (&quot;hot&quot;) links of text or image data amongdifferent applications.andP;  PM provides the tools for this functionality, butthe programming to implement it is complex.andP;  For this reason, manyindependent software vendors (ISVs), will delay its inclusion until OS/2itself becomes a more stable platform.andM;To date, as Ray Duncan has repeatedly commented in his Power Programmingcolumn, each new update of OS/2 has required a major overhaul of an existingOS/2 product.andP;  This produces much frustration and little immediate payback.andO;Hence, even though OS/2 1.2 is a more stable environment, provides betterprinter capabilities, and supports the High Performance File System (HPFS),you won't begin to see wide implementation of these features (or DDE) untilsometime after the release of OS/2 2.0, (Since Version 2.0 is now inprerelease, ISVs, can bypass Version 1.2 altogether if they choose.)andM;In this connection, is should be noted that vendors who have and intend toproduce multiplication versions of their products face difficulties andlimitations that single-line PM developers do not.andP;  While multiplication ISVsare obviously committed to OS/2, most of them have an existing Windowsproduct and DOS customers to consider.andP;  These customers are paying thefreight, and their need is more for cross-version compatibility than for thelatest OS/2 technology.andM;DDE will again serve to illustrate the problem.andP;  While both Windows and PMoffer DDE, OS/2 offers sophisticated multithreaded, nonpreemptive tasking,giving it far greater DEE capabilities than those available under Windows.andO;Windows offers quasimultitasking, but it lacks the nonpreemptivefunctionality of OS/2.andP;  What, then, should a vendor do when he tries to writefor multiple platforms?andP;  He can only maintain consistency betweenenvironments by bringing out a product whose features represent a lowestcommon denominator, and even this requires writing vastly different set ofcode for the two environments.andP;  Consequently, you can expect to see onlyminor feature enhancements within first generation PM products that have aWindows counterpart.andM;To multiplatform ISVs and their corporate customers, then, cross-versioncompatibility is important enough to warrant whatever programming lagsresult.andP;  Part of Aldus's success with PageMaker PM stems from the kind ofworkaround users have been able to employ to solve the infamous OS/2print-driver problem.andP;  One solution has been to prepare publications inPageMaker PM and then to move them back to PageMaker under Windows, whereprinter driver support is abundant.andP;  Typically, this is not a once-onlyproposition: files must often be shipped back and forth between the twoplatforms repeatedly, and absolute data integrity must be assured.andP;  WhileAldus mentions, in a release note, that front width tables betweenenvironments do not always match and can affect line breaks, users with whomI have spoken have been lavish in their praise of the file fidelitymaintained when crossing platforms.andM;DESCRIBEandM;One new publishing application on the market may compel more than a few usersto consider an immediate move to PM.andP;  Unhampered by a DOS product/customerbase to support, DeScribe, a Sacramento, California--based developer, was outearly with its PM product, DeScribe--an impressive first release.andP;  Thecompany's next upgrade is expected to be compatible with OS/2 1.2 and offerthe most advanced DDE capabilities of any PM product in the publishing realmto date.andM;DeScribe is not exactly a word processor, nor is it a desktop publisher.andP;  Itmight more accurately be termed a &quot;word publisher.&quot;andP;  The product is similarin design and functionality to Microsoft's Word for Windows.andP;  The page-layoutand high-end-publishing capabilities fall short of the best desktoppublishers, so you wouldn't use this product for designing and producingbrochures, posters, magazines, or books.andP;  What you would consider using itfor is daily word processing that requires report-quality output andregularly incorporates tables, charts, and pictures from other PMapplications.andM;Although not specifically a desktop publisher, DeScribe offers the bestintegrated publishing currently available.andP;  Using special DDE paste-links,DeScribe lets you work in concert with all other PM applications.andP;  Excel PMusers will be particularly delighted, for since Excel charts are alreadydynamically linked to their spreadsheet sources, you really gain athree-level link when you bring them into DeScribe.andM;Accuracy and consistency are perhaps the two biggest advantage to usingDDE--especially when changes are being made under tight deadlines.andP;  Linkedcharts can be resized within DeScribe, and if the chart type is changedwithin Excel's Gallery, the update will occur simultaneously in DeScribe.andO;The same paste-link functionality also works with Excel spreadsheets fordisplaying &quot;live&quot; tabular data in a DeScribe document.andP;  And thetape-recorder-style macro facility within DeScribe lets you play back theseand other functions in future documents.andM;Even if DDE is not your main concern, you might want to convert to DeScribefor its world publishing and processing features alone.andP;  If you writeprofessionally DeScribe's spell-checker, interactive the saurus, anddictionary are enticing.andP;  For starters, you can opt to spell a word, aselection of text, the contents of an object (that is placeholder or frame),or the entire document.andP;  Through each of these venues you're taken into theword maven' equivalent of the child's candy store.andP;  For each suggestedspelling, you can elect to view full dictionary with noun and verb usage andsyllabic divisions and associated infections for the current word.andM;If you're unsatisfied with the word a hand, DeScribe's thesaurus will helpyou pick a more appropriate one.andP;  Unlike the common on-line thesaurus, thison doesn't lump synonymous into only two categories--nouns and verbs;instead, DeScribe distinguishes between true synonyms and merely relatedwords.andP;  It also gives you the luxury of seeing antonyms contrasted, andcompared words.andP;  Choose any of these options and explore!andP;  The hierarchy justgoes on and on every move performed intuitively and without effort.andP;  In fact,if you are familiar with Windows and a few of its better applications, you'llfind that it's not necessary to read DeScribe handsome, if somewhat sketchy,documentation.andM;All in all, the DeScribe developers have a handle on the features thatconcern writers and many &quot;self-publishers&quot;--feature that find their mostnatural implementation within the PM environment.andM;MORE MOVES TO PMandM;PageMaker and DeScribe will not be along among PM-publishing-related productsreleased by the time you read this article.andP;  Several illustration and drawingprograms will also be available, including Micrograf Designer, Corel System'sCorel Draw!, and Computer Support's Arts andamp; Letters.andM;Another major PM publishing product you can expect to see sometime in thesecond quarter of 1990 is Ventura Publisher.andP;  Xerox Desktop software, thedivision of Xerox that manages the marketing and development of Ventura, alsoplans to release a Windows 3.0 version at about the same time.andM;Xerox Desktop Software faces a unique challenge in its PM development.andP;  Whilemost PM applications grew up in and outgrew Windows, Ventura originated fromGEM-based code.andP;  A thorough redesign was required for it to take advantage ofthe PM environment.andP;  Moreover, while PageMaker users are generally happy withthe product per se but unsatisfied with its performance under Windows,Ventura users are generally happy both with the product and with itsperformance in GEM.andP;  It's unknown at this point whether the redesign will putVentura into the same general performance category as PageMaker PM.andP;  If so,some of the Ventura users may very well decide to remain with their originalDOS version.andM;In general, features comparable with those found in the current release ofPageMaker PM are expected to appear in the premier version of Ventura PM.andO;These will include both background processing and multiple document handling.andO;But until OS/2 can fully support network software and Venture PM incorporatesthe &quot;big&quot; OS/2 features (for example, DDE), Xerox Desktop Software may have atough time convincing present users to journey into the Presentation Manager.andM;TRUE TYPE ENHANCEMENTS TO PMandM;This preview of desktop publishing under OS/2's Presentation Manager wouldhardly be complete without mentioning the Apple True Type (formerly calledRoyal) technology that Microsoft has licensed for use in its products.andP;  Justas OS/2 will ultimately provide a common ground for all PC applications, TrueType will provide developers with a common basis of device-independence fordisplaying and printing fonts.andM;Put simply, from a single True Type outline font, you can generate a rasterfont of any size for any graphic screen or any printer.andP;  Ultimately--and Imust emphasize the word ultimately--your printer won't need all the cartridgefonts and software fonts to which you've become accustomed.andP;  Both screen andprinter fonts will be generated from the same True Type outlines.andM;You can see a crude from of what True Type technology will bring when youselect the Windows screen fonts for Modern, Script, Roman, and othertypefaces.andP;  However, these Windows screen fonts are stroke type, unfilled,and, contain no scaling hints that spell the difference between good-lookingand bad-looking fonts.andP;  True Type's renditions are curved outlines capable ofsolid fills, and they are hinted.andM;The resources required to use True Type screen fonts as a means of producingprinter fonts is presently much too slow and memory-intensive to bepractical.andP;  So when True Type is introduced to PM and for some timethereafter, it will still behoove you to own all the printer fonts you planto use, relying on True Type's expertise to manage the screen.andM;Eventually, you'll be able to purchase True Type fonts the same way you doAdobe and PCL fonts.andP;  If you've spent thousands or even just hundreds ofdollars on Adobe typefaces, however, you may be more concerned about whetherthe new font technology can be used together with the typefaces you alreadyown.andP;  Fortunately, this will not present a problem.andM;For the immediate future, at least, you will inform PM, through the OS/2print manager, where your typefaces reside.andP;  Assuming you have associatedthem with a currently selected output device, these fonts will then appear,as usual, in the font menus of your applications.andP;  What you will see on yourscreen as you work is an almost perfectly matched True Type font that hasbeen interpreted from the metrics of each Adobe font you use.andM;As my &quot;almost perfectly matched&quot; hedge implies, unless the printer font isalso a True Type font, a 100-percent match cannot be absolutely guaranteed.andO;However, at least with the commonly used varieties of Times Roman andHelvetica, the match will almost certainly appear to be 100 percent.andP;  Indeed,you will probably have a better screen font match than is available withincurrent operating environments.andP;  This is because what True Type generates isa mathematically equivalent screen font for any point size selected.andP;  To getthis quality now requires storing individual screen font files withpreprocessed (sized) images.andM;The third-party development opportunities, either conforming to True Typespecifications directly or offering parallel conversion routines, are legion.andO;For example, a thrid-party developer might offer you a conversion programthat would generate an entirely separate True Type library based upon yourAdobe or Bitstream collection.andP;  Another natural offering would be a True Typecompatibility cartridge for your HP LaserJet.andP;  Such a cartridge would containthe so-called Adobe 13 fonts that are expected, in True Type format, to shipwith the premier True Type-enhanced Presentation Manager.andM;Naturally, when asked when True Type would actually debut, Microsoft declinedto answer.andP;  But when questioned as to whether developers and users would besubject to the same dribbleware distribution of True Type enhancements asthey currently are with OS/2, Microsoft's PM font authority, Viktor Grabner,was unequivocal: &quot;You will not see a semisuable True Type!&quot;andM;By the time you read this Lab Notes, Microsoft will presumably have shippedits long-promised HP LaserJet driver with PCL soft font support.andP;  This shouldnot be confused with the new True Type technology.andP;  But it should help yourealize that although True Type will be built into future versions of PM, itwill be done in a way that expands rather than restricts your choices.andP;  Youwill still be able to manage your existing fonts in an improved but similarmanner to the way you've become accustomed to under Windows.andM;Will Windows 3.0 itself eventually support the True Type technology?andP;  Theanswer is a define yes, and the time frame will likely be less than a yearfrom now.andM;The last controversy, of course, centers on IBM's recent decision to supportAdobe PostScript on most of its platforms.andP;  This will, at worst, causeserious confusion for users.andP;  Doubly confusing is that IBM will also supportTrue Type under Presentation Manager and OS/2.andM;This begs the question: which technology will IBM really support?andP;  For thetime being, all we can do is wait and see.andP;  Hopefully, in the long run theuser will benefit from the superior technology competition usually spawns.andM;DTP AND PRESENTATION MANAGERandM;OS/2 and Presentation Manager offer desktop publishers at all levels theprospect of more creative options, more flexible and cost-effective printingalternatives, further accuracy in screen renditions of their layouts, andreal-time interaction with graphics and text that comes from--and shouldremain in--outside applications.andM;The ability to forge links to outside applications is crucial to the successof desktop publishing in the OS/2 PM environment.andP;  DTP applications thatincorporate PM's DDE functionality will draw both medium- to high-endpublishers to OS/2.andP;  Medium-end desktop publishers--and especially corporatefinancial publishers--will be able to justify the cost of an OS/2 workstationby gaining direct interaction with tables, charts, and graphs.andP;  Although thequality of the interchange is important to such users, it is the accuracyachieved through dynamic linking that will attract them to PM DTP.andM;The high-end publishing houses, such as magazines, newspapers, and someadvertising agencies, willhasten to put OS/2 in their budgets for much thesame reason, though the DDE interaction they need is with text and artworkapplications.andP;  As indicated above, by the time you read this, many of thebest illustration and imaging products will have made their way to thePresentation Manager.andM;Along with DDR, typeset and color-separation output are important to thehigh-end publishers.andP;  Printer driver support must be equal to or better thanthat on which they've come to rely in their current applications.andP;  Theimplementation of True Type and its ability to read Adobe fonts, as well asPM's ability to download them, will be another required improvement.andM;Efficient DDE is no less important to DTP ISVs themselves.andP;  If viable linkscan be forged to outside applications, it makes it easier for DTP vendors todetermine which features they should include with their products.andP;  Many ofthe common features users currently ask for--for example, a spell checker,thesaurus, search-and-replace functions, and other &quot;code-heavy&quot; baggage--maybe best be left in the province of the word processor, if you can directlyinteract with it.andP;  Similarly, if you lok at those recent word processors thatattempt to perform DTP functions, you'll find that they perform thesefunctions less efficiently compared with the best DTP applications on themarket.andM;DDE thus offers everyone a better, more efficient publishing environment.andP;  Ithas workgroup written all over it, and that's exactly what in-housepublishing is eventually all about.andM;PREPARING FOR TOMORROWandM;Unfortunately, the currently released version of OS/2, 1.2, is virtuallynonnetwork compatible.andP;  Unitl OS/2 and PM can support popular networkenvironments, especially those on which companies are currently standardized,none of us can yet realize the final dream of truly integrated, multitasking,distributed-processing desktop publishing.andP;  Given the hyperfast way thingshappen in the personal computer industry, however, it's best to beginpreparing for that happy future right now.andM;The first step is to make the move to Presentation Manager--based desktoppublishing as soon as possible, for it is clear that the future of DTP is inthe PM environment.andP;  Before the applications you will eventually want areavailable--that's the time to begin planning your hardware purchases, so thatyou're ready for the day when the software finally arrives.andP;  And that day isnot very far off!andM;DESKTOP PUBLISHING HARDWAREandM;Here are three different workstation configurations equipped for desktoppublishing.andP;  Each is perfectly suited for the DTP application installed.andO;These workstations offer a comparison of two factors: price and performance.andO;The prices shown are actually advertised street prices (nobody pays list inthe real world) that can likely be matched in most metropolitan areas.andM;In terms of performance, you'll see that one of the DOS workstations is a 286machine running Ventura Publisher.andP;  This is presented as a real alternative,since Ventura is the only high-end desktop publishing application that canreasonably be run on an AT-class machine.andP;  The other workstation, an80/386-based model, will run either PageMaker, Ventura, or any other DOS DTPapplication you choose.andM;The third workstation is, of course, an 80/386-based model running OS/2.andO;Although not an absolute requirement, this computer is equipped with asomewhat larger hard disk drive.andP;  (This is to accommodate the many PMapplications with large graphics files, together with a significant DOSapplication subset).andP;  A larger hard disk drive, together with the need foradditional memory, are the two primary cost boosters on a DTP workstationthat is running under OS/2.andM;With memory prices greatly dropped in 1990 from thier high mark in 1988 andwith the increasingly low cost of mass storage, you can see that therequirements to run OS/2 are not so imposing.andM;With any of these model workstations, a laser printer is also a necessity.andO;As good as PostScript printer as can be afforded, regardless of theenvironment, is the rule.andP;  For this reason I've left printers out of theworkstation listings, as the choices that are available are quite broad anddon't really aid in these comparisons.andM;Tami Peterson owns Decorum Corp., a New York DTP consultancy, and is afrequent contributor to PC Magazine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
