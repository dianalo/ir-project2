In doing so, it chose someone who will focus on its business activities rather than act as the financial district's roving ambassador.    On Friday, the Stock Exchange announced the election of 56-year-old Mr. Hugh Smith as its &quot;chairman-designate.&quot; He is a senior partner in the London brokerage firm Capel-Cure Myers and deputy chairman of ANZ Merchant Bank Ltd. He will succeed Sir Nicholas Goodison, who came under some criticism for his patrician style. Sir Nicholas, 54, steps down as head of the exchange in November to become chairman of TSB Group PLC, a British banking group.    Mr. Hugh Smith won't be sure he has won the chairmanship until October. That's when elections will be held for a new council, the exchange's governing body, with voting rights that give greater weight to large member firms. Mr. Hugh Smith must be elected a member of the new council, which then is expected to ratify him as chairman.    Mr. Hugh Smith, a member of the stock exchange council since 1981, currently heads its property and finance committee. The panel is responsible for developing the stock exchange's business activities, including the transmission of business information. These activities now generate revenue of about #200 million ($342.7 million) a year. They have become increasingly important since the exchange ceded many of its regulatory functions to the Securities Association, the self-regulating organization for the securities industry under Britain's new financial regulatory system. </TEXT></DOC>
