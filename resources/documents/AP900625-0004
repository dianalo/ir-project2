About 40 pieces of the wall were sold Saturday night at theMetropole Palace, for a total of $630,000. The proceeds were tobenefit public health services in East Germany.   But many lots were withdrawn by the organizers _ a consortium ofEast German and West German companies _ because no bidders reachedthe minimum sale prices set in advance. These prices ranged from$12,600 to $36,000.   The biggest spender was an unidentified Swiss buyer who boughteight chunks for $175,000.   Most of the pieces up for bid weighed more than two tons andwere almost 12 feet high, which may have inhibited collectors withlimited display space.   A glossy catalogue prepared for the auction depicted the wallsegments in the same sort of language usually reserved forprestigious art works.   One chunk was described as ``anonymous graffito: an originalpainting in a very good state of preservation, slight damage to theleft side.''</TEXT></DOC>
