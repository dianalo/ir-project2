The ministry didn't articulate any specific concerns with the bid, but market watchers said the trade commission would be investigating the effect a takeover would have on Ireland's whiskey industry and economy and on the employees and shareholders of Irish Distillers.    The trade commission is expected to make a nonbinding recommendation to the ministry within two or three weeks. The ministry may decide to allow the bid to proceed as it stands, choose to adopt a middle ground by allowing the bid to go through on certain conditions, or simply block the bid altogether.    The bid, launched Aug. 19, replaced a 198.5 million-punt offer a GCandamp;C group made in May before GCandamp;C was restructured as a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan. Grand Metropolitan has said the current offer of 400 Irish pence ($5.74) a share wouldn't be raised unless a third party enters the battle.    Speculation about a potential white knight for Irish Distillers centers around Pernod-Ricard S.A., a French drinks group that holds less than 1% of the Irish company. Pernod has acknowledged talking with Irish Distillers and yesterday said &quot;different possibilities&quot; were being studied. </TEXT></DOC>
