In orderto get a dynamic update of the boundary topology in an automized mannersome special logical features are used involving special node types andinjection elements for the boundary. If the on-line-state-estimator givesisolated measurement groups that are to be interconnected by a load flowbase case the phase angles of these different measured regions must bebalanced. This problem is handled by a special radial expansion process.In the security simulation system of EGL (Elektrizitats-GesellschaftLaufenburg) these algorithms are used with the result of nearly automaticadaption of the connection between the estimated and the external network.</TEXT></DOC>
