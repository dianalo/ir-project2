But we can forgive them for not keeping customary track of theirnewest clients' salaries this season.;    Seems the NFLPA is busy scoringvictory after victory against the enemy -- the owners -- in various courtroomsthroughout the land. It all has Executive Director Gene Upshaw and the rest ofhis staff pretty tied up, and the owners fit to be tied.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PLAYERS WIN BIG IN COURT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.NFL Report  </MEMO><TEXT>     The players won two huge decisions in the past three weeks. First, U.S.District Judge David Doty in Minneapolis cleared a path for players to sue forfree agency by throwing out the NFL's labor exemption.;    Then on July 5,another district court, this time in Washington, D.C., ruled the NFL'santitrust exemption ended with the expiration of the last collectivebargaining agreement in 1987. The judge, Royce C. Lamberth, found for playerswho sued over pay for members of the controversial developmental squads in1989, and the ruling could result in even bigger changes.;    How about a wagescale, which management is pushing for? No way. The courts are saying thiscan't be forced upon players. The NFL is now liable under federal antitrustlaws. Remember, no more exemption.;    The latest ruling also could mean theend of the college draft, which the union argues is a violation of antitrustlaws and limits players' salaries. The draft itself is due to expire nextspring under the old 1982 collective bargaining agreement.;    But this iswhat has management most nervous: Since antitrust plaintiffs are awardedtriple damages, the league, the NFLPA estimates, could be liable for $75million to $80 million. Ouch.;    How are the owners responding? By fightingback. Thursday, they voted in Dallas to begin taking depositions from topagents in their suit against the NFLPA regarding price-fixing.;    The battleroyal continues. Stay tuned . . .;  NO DOUGH, NO SHOW: Denver Broncos runningback Bobby Humphrey and free safety Steve Atwater, both three-year veteransand Pro Bowl players with two years left on their contracts, are no-shows atcamp. They're looking for more cash. Coach Dan Reeves has no sympathy for thetwo, who made a combined $1.365 million last year.;    &quot;This football team hasalways shown that it is going to compensate its people fairly. I'm verydisappointed they aren't here,&quot; Reeves said, fuming. &quot;If you sign something,you've got to be happy with it. I've never seen a player or a coach come inand say, 'I had a bad year last year, I want to rip it up and I'll give yousome money back.';    While Humphrey and Atwater fared well individually, theBroncos themselves were, well, the best doggone 5-11 team in the league lastseason.;    Said quarterback John Elway, &quot;I've got three years left on mycontract. When you've had a bad year, they don't dock your pay, they don'tkick you out of camp. So if you have a good year, I don't think youautomatically go in and ask for a new contract. I think you stand by thecontract that you sign.&quot;;  GROUNDED: His $26 million contract hangs like analbatross around Raghib &quot;Rocket&quot; Ismail's neck. Sure, it's tough to fly with apulled quadriceps, but when Rocket missed his season opener as a Toronto Argo,the razzing took off like he apparently can't.;    &quot;Everybody's waiting to seewhat he can do,&quot; veteran Ottawa guard Bryan Illerbrun said. &quot;I only wish I wason the punt team, so I'd be there if he dropped his wallet.&quot;;  SEE YA: Gone,and hopefully soon forgotten, is Zeke Mowatt, best known for being one of thethree New England Patriots implicated last season in the sexual harassment ofreporter Lisa Olson.;    &quot;It didn't seem he was happy with the football team,and we wanted him to have an opportunity elsewhere,&quot; said Patriots Coach DickMacPherson, who waived Mowatt.;    But Mowatt may yet surface with the NewYork Giants, who need a replacement for the injured Mark Bavaro.;  EXTRAPOINTS: Former Iowa running back Nick Bell is signed and working out with theLos Angeles Raiders, leaving Southern Cal quarterback Todd Marinovich, thefirst-round pick, as the Raiders' only unsigned pick. . . . Agent Bob Woolfwas so concerned about getting his first-round clients, No. 4 Mike Croel andNo. 5 Todd Lyght into their respective camps on time, he went on vacation lastweek in Europe. . . . Buffalo Bills safety Mark Kelso, 27, has been workingwith a track coach in the off-season to improve his speed. He says his200-meter time has dropped from 29 seconds to 26 seconds. . . . New OrleansSaints defensive lineman Frank Warren has been reinstated by NFL CommissionerPaul Tagliabue after a yearlong drug suspension. . . . Broncos running backSteve Sewell agreed to a three-year contract, leaving Denver with fiveunsigned veterans.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Nancy Gay  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910714  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  850  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 14, 199100196114,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
