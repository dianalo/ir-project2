The cut in pay, from April 13 to June 30, was part of Gov.Robert P. Casey's cost-cutting measure to close a projected$315 million budget gap for the fiscal year, ending June 30.A spokesman for the governor's office said it will appeal theorder to the state supreme court.</LP><TEXT>   The unions -- the Pennsylvania Social Services Union, theIndependent State Store Union and the Federation of StateCultural and Educational Professionals -- had filed suitsaying the pay cut violated a state administrative law thatprovides state employees be &quot;paid a regular salary.&quot; A fourthunion, the Pennsylvania Nurses Association, which took partin the filing, reached an accord with the state and droppedout of the lawsuit.   Despite the injunction, about 7,700 other supervisoryemployees not associated with the unions are scheduled toreceive a smaller paycheck this week. That portion of the paycut is expected to save the state about $4.2 million.</TEXT></DOC>
