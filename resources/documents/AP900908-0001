(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A suspect in the killing of fivecollege students said he knew who killed two victims and gave aname police believe is one of his multiple personalities, anewspaper reported Friday.   Edward Lewis Humphrey, 18, has been held in the Brevard CountyJail on charges of assaulting his grandmother but has not beencharged in any of the Gainesville killings.   The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, citing unidentifiedsources, said in its early Saturday editions that, after he wasarrested Aug. 30, he talked to officers about the killings of thefirst two victims _ Christina Powell, 17, and Sonja Larson, 18.They were found Aug. 26 in their Gainesville apartment.   He said he knew who killed the two and blamed one of thepersonalities he has appeared to exhibit, the Times-Union reported.   The newspaper did not print the name, but during a bond hearingThursday, a jail guard had testified that Humphrey referred tohimself as ``John.''   Humphrey's lawyer, public defender J. R. Russo, told TheAssociated Press he was unaware of any such statements by hisclient.   ``It's news to me,'' he said.   He added that he had been concerned all along about Humphrey'sinitial interrogation, which took place with no lawyer present.   So far, authorities have refused to discuss publicly whatHumphrey said in any statement.   Meanwhile, police said Friday that they have gathered``promising'' evidence, but cautioned that they don't expect anyimmediate results.   Police would provide no details about what information wasgathered in searches of Humphrey's Gainesville apartment, his carand his grandmother's home in Indialantic, a coastal city about 180miles southeast of Gainesville.   ``We did not leave empty-handed,'' Lt. Sadie Darnell said, butadded that lab tests will take time to tell if they have anythinguseful as evidence.   Besides the searches of the homes and car, agents obtained apersonal search warrant for Humphrey that could yield evidence onbodily fluids, fingerprints and hair.   Agents spent Thursday searching Humphrey's apartment and the13-room, two-story house in Indialantic. Humphrey's car was loadedonto a flatbed car carrier and taken to a state crime lab inJacksonville where it was to be searched.   ``Evidence gathered at both scenes and in Brevard County ispromising,'' Ms. Darnell said.   Despite the intense interest in Humphrey, police continue to sayhe is one of eight suspects and no arrests are imminent. Policecanceled weekend news briefings, saying no significant developmentsare expected.   ``We are not going to identify anyone as a No. 1 suspect,'' Ms.Darnell said, adding police had received 3,670 leads so far.   New charges of aggravated assault have been filed againstHumphrey as a result of a confrontation the night before the firsttwo bodies were discovered.   Greg Herskowitz and Rob Lipvak, two 18-year-old Pi Lambda Phipledges, claim Humphrey threatened them with a knife at thefraternity house Aug. 25.   Humphrey is being held on $1 million bond in an attack on his79-year-old grandmother. He also faces charges in Indian RiverCounty of armed burglary and attempted sexual battery two years ago.   Police disclosed for the first time Friday that Manuel Taboada,the only man killed by the serial slayer, was asleep in bed when hewas slain.   ``He was apparently surprised by his attacker,'' Ms. Darnellsaid.   Besides Larson and Powell, the other victims were Christa Hoyt,19, and Taboada's roommate Tracy Paules, 23.   Dr. Michael West, who spent 1{ days studying the three murderscenes, said he believes the killer was wearing gloves because heleft virtually no trace of himself.   ``I thought I'd seen everything,'' he said in a taping of the``Donahue'' show that was broadcast live in Gainesville Friday.``When the full story is released, you'll be shocked and amazed.''   The show was almost knocked off the air when a man riding abicycle stopped and cut cables to five of six cameras, police said.The man was not caught.</TEXT></DOC>
