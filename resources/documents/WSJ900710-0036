The union, the Air Line Pilots Association, immediatelysaid it would send strike ballots to its members.</LP><TEXT>   It's unlikely, however, that a strike would have anywherenear the impact of last year's strike by machinists, whichwas supported by pilots and flight attendants. That strike,in March 1989, nearly grounded Eastern and tipped thefinancially ailing carrier into bankruptcy court. Easternpainstakingly built itself back to about 80% of itspre-strike operations, and the pilots and flight attendantsended their walkouts in November.   The makeup of the pilot work force is starkly differentthis time. The 1,900 pilots now flying for Eastern -- abouthalf of the pre-strike total -- are evenly split betweenrecently hired replacements and pilots who crossed the picketline. Neither group has any reason to show special loyalty tothe pilots union. Only 89 pilots who went out on strikebefore have been recalled. Union officials estimate that anadditional 1,403 are waiting to return. Under labor law,however, the pilots union is still the bargaining agent forall pilots working for Eastern.   &quot;The so-called strike vote they're talking about would bepolling pilots who aren't working,&quot; said an Easternspokeswoman. &quot;It would be a non-event.&quot;   The union's contract expired in mid-1988, but underairline labor law, the old contract remains in effect until anew one is negotiated or the National Mediation Board findsthe two sides are at an impasse. That happened when the boardproferred arbitration to the two sides, and the unionaccepted while Eastern refused.   The issues that brought this confrontation to a head arean outgrowth of the previous strike's ultimate failure. Bothsides essentially agree on the financial aspects of a newcontract, and pilots say they are prepared to makesignificant wage concessions because their main concernscenter on job guarantees. Pilot negotiators say Easternoffered to provide only 510 jobs over the next three yearsfor formerly striking pilots. The pilots also want toreattain their pre-strike seniority, but Eastern says itwon't downgrade the replacement pilots who saw the companythrough the strike.   In a statement, the pilots union also charged that Easternrequired that all pilot grievances, claims and lawsuits bedropped before any contract could be signed. The union saidthat included claims against Continental Airlines HoldingsInc. which holds the equity in Eastern and, until April,controlled the carrier. Continental Airlines Holdings is thenew name for Texas Air Corp.   Eastern, which countered by saying the pilots demandedthat all litigation against the union be dropped, said thoseissues are &quot;totally extraneous.&quot;   Complicating dealings between the two sides is Eastern'sstatus in bankruptcy court. Until spring, Eastern had been aunit of Texas Air, but Eastern's creditors grew frustrated bythe constantly changing reorganization plans from Texas Air'schairman, Frank Lorenzo. In April, at the creditors request,the bankruptcy court removed Texas Air from day-to-daymanagement and appointed a trustee, Martin R. Shugrue. Mr.Shugrue has consistently maintained that labor peace is oneof his goals, but so far he has had no luck in negotiatingwith either the pilots or the still-striking machinists.Pilots have charged that Mr. Shugrue's words are a &quot;stallingtactic.&quot;   Furthermore, despite bankruptcy court protection, Easterncontinues to be unprofitable. The airline has said itsbreak-even load factor, the percentage of seats it needs tofill, stands at 80%. But in May, load factor was 54%. Junetraffic hasn't been disclosed yet.</TEXT></DOC>
