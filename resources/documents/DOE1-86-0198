<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-0198 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experimental programme has been undertaken to study the physics ofneutron activation as applied to the sorting of manganese ore. The basisfor the sorting technique utilised the radiative capture reaction /sup55/Mn(n,{gamma})/sup 56/Mn. A 1 mg/sup 252/Cf source was used for theactivation. The object was to relate the /sup 56/Mn activity to the manganeseconcentration in irregular pieces of ore (typically between 100-1000g)under irradiation and counting conditions suitable for an on-line application.A procedure was developed for irradiating the ore under water. This increasedthe thermal flux by about 36 times. Lumps of ore were counted between2 NaI detectors, 130mm apart. This eliminated differences in countingdue to sample irregularity. A calibration procedure was evolved to takeinto account the irregularity of the ore pieces. Two methods based onthe sample mass and on the geometrical projection of sample were used.Both methods produced an accuracy of about 10%.</TEXT></DOC>
