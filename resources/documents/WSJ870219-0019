But even if Congress approves the bill, such a prohibition probably wouldn't survive an almost-certain presidential veto. Several Democratic members of the panel conceded that they probably couldn't muster the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto.    Last year, after intensive White House lobbying, Congress approved $100 million in aid for the rebels, known as Contras. Yesterday's vote was aimed at blocking the final $40 million portion of that aid package. This final aid portion can be released as soon as the administration submits a report on the Contra aid program. Congressional aides expect the report to be submitted today.    The vote came as the Contras' fortunes have dimmed considerably. Earlier this week, Adolfo Calero, one of the three leaders of the United Nicaraguan Opposition, the rebels' umbrella group, resigned after continual bickering among the top leadership. The Contras also have been tarnished by allegations that profits from secret U.S. arms sales to Iran were funneled to them during a period when Congress prohibited U.S. assistance.    As a result, the administration's request for $105 million for the rebels for next year is expected to meet strong resistance when it is presented to legislators later this year. </TEXT></DOC>
