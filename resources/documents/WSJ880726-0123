But significantly, those uniforms aren't the same as those worn in the French army, navy or air force.    That is because the DGA, which is responsible for weapons development and procurement for all three French services, totaling about $15 billion a year, is part of none of them. That, say the French, makes &quot;toute la difference.&quot;    The French system of supplying arms to its armed forces is being seriously studied in Washington as a possible basis for reform of the Pentagon's scandal-plagued weapons procurement system. One of the key problems in the U.S., investigators say, is that the separate buying arms of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force results in costly duplication of development, bad coordination of purchasing, and invites corruption when officials move between government and private industry.    The French avoid many of these problems by centralizing control in the DGA, run by a corps of military officers who are also professional, career arms designers and buyers trained to understand both the mechanics of weapons systems and the politics of the armed services.    In Washington, the House Armed Services Committee plans to hold hearings this fall on proposals to replace the tri-service buying bureaucracies with a French-style professional acquisition corps. A measure introduced by Rep. Dennis M. Hertel (D., Mich.) would staff a Pentagon agency, similar to the DGA, with officers who are career acquisition specialists.    &quot;There is genuine agreement that we have to 'professionalize' the acquisition system,&quot; says an aide to the House committee. &quot;Obviously the French model is one where this works successfully.&quot;    A more drastic measure sponsored by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.) would remove the military from the acquisition process, turning responsibility for designing and testing weapons to a new agency staffed by civilians. The Pentagon is expected to oppose such a measure.    The French acquisition agency, created against the wishes of the French military in 1961 by Gen. Charles de Gaulle, is directly answerable to the defense minister, a civilian apppointed by the prime minister, not to individual service chiefs. Its 1,000 military officers supervise a staff of 25,000, mainly civil servants, who act as a buffer between the military services and the arms producers, which in France are about evenly divided between state-controlled and private firms.    The DGA sifts requests for new weapons from each service, places orders for them with the companies, and controls both price and quality. All three French services a few years ago wanted to design and develop their own surface-to-air missiles. The DGA decided they would all get the same one, and got Matra S.A. to design the Mistral missile. When French industry suggested developing its own early-warning surveillance aircraft, the DGA found the idea too costly, and recommended buying U.S.-built Awacs planes instead.    The DGA is currently deciding how many different versions of Avions Marcel Dassault's new Rafale fighter should be produced, in response to requests for five different models from the air force and navy. The DGA also keeps close tabs on equipment costs. Because of this, says a Defense Ministry official, the French Mirage 2000 fighter program came in on budget while the rival European Tornado fighter was 25% over budget. &quot;Whenever the air force or navy would come and say they had 20 new specifications to add to the plane, the DGA told them to forget it,&quot; the official recalls.    &quot;The system certainly works well for them&quot; says a U.S. military official. &quot;Whether it would work in our much larger and much more complex system is an open question, though an interesting one.&quot;    Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a former French arms industry official, says a U.S. version of the DGA would require replacement of the Pentagon's procurement staff. That, he says, &quot;would be fought tooth and nail by the joint chiefs, and also by Congress, which exercises a micromanagement of the Pentagon that the French parliament doesn't come close to.&quot;    &quot;The key thing is that the people {in the DGA} run no career risks by making decisions one particular branch of the military doesn't like,&quot; adds Mr. Heisbourg. &quot;They are inter-service and inter-service all their lives and so have no fear of saying no to a new tank and going back to the army three years later to face a firing squad.&quot; He says the system enables the inevitable inter-service struggles to be played out far from the public eye, and for the occasional cancellation of weapons systems before development costs run amok.    DGA isn't problem-free. It is staffed mainly by bureaucrats, carefully trained in the rigid French system, with no experience of managing a company. Arms companies sometimes complain that DGA bureaucrats make unreasonable demands. The services, and potential foreign buyers of French weapons, complain that the DGA-directed system has killed competition among French companies -- only one makes planes, another makes rockets -- which sometimes leads to sloppy, unimaginative products. While the Pentagon uses a sophisticated French battlefield communications system, Dassault is having trouble selling its new jet fighter outside France.    Another problem, members of parliament say, is that the power concentrated in the DGA takes a strong defense minister to control. But DGA officers contend that if they abuse their authority, the defense contractors and the individual services complain loudly to the minister.    The cosiness of the system, requiring close cooperation among the services, the DGA and the arms makers, does invite revolving-door movement between the government and industry. But because much of the arms industry is state-run, and because salaries in both sectors are similar, there is probably less temptation to corruption, the French say.    &quot;No system is perfect, but we've probably got more efficiency and less corruption because of the DGA,&quot; says a former top DGA man. That doesn't mean there aren't scandals, but these usually involve breakdowns in the control over arms exports, for example to Iran or South Africa.    &quot;The fact that France has had the DGA,&quot; says the former DGA official, &quot;has enabled us as a medium-size country with a limited defense budget to develop a coherent, effective, efficient, nuclear and conventional defense industry second only to the U.S. within the Western alliance. If we had wasted our resources for the past 25 years we would never have been able to do it.&quot;    ---   Eileen White Read contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
