Just as Mr.Carter's incomplete understanding of the flag as the &quot;symbol&quot;of the Bill of Rights prevents him, as it does a majority ofthe Supreme Court, from recognizing that the flag should beprotected as an instrument of sovereignty, his egalitarianismprevents him from understanding that the price of imposing&quot;equality&quot; on the states was the loss of their freedom ofself-determination.   Gordon D. Payne</LP><TEXT>   Madison, Wis.   ---   I say three cheers for someone with guts and clearthinking. I hope this column helped persuade the cowards andthe wishy-washy, muddled-thinking congressmen and senators tostand up and be counted among those who oppose thisamendment. Opposing this amendment sends a message to thosewho would tamper with, and whittle away, our rights under ourglorious Constitution, and will help courageous lawmakers bere-elected.
