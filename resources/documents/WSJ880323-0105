White-jacketed waiters served wine and cheese to 50 guests, many of whom, such as Betty Friedan, were veterans of other crusades.    The civic group was seeking to force Donald Trump, the high-profile developer, to drastically scale down his plans for Trump City, a huge office and apartment complex on Manhattan's West Side. Westpride fears that the project, which would include a world-record 152-story building, eight 60-story skyscrapers and the city's biggest shopping mall, would choke streets with traffic and destroy the area's relaxed, neighborhood ambiance.    John Moore, a professional investor who had won an earlier eviction fight against the powerful Mr. Trump, said something that probably few at the meeting believed. &quot;You can beat this man,&quot; he asserted.    The current struggle is expected to drag on for months. Win or lose, Westpride has developed a set of tactics that could serve as a battle plan in a new national game: fighting developers. Westpride's strategy is two-pronged. Its leaders, mostly affluent professionals, are raising money and support, block by block. And they are hiring experts who understand real-estate development and how to stop it.    &quot;They aren't community crazies,&quot; says Anthony Wood, an officer with JM Kaplan Fund, a philanthropy that has given advice and money to Westpride. &quot;These people know the process.&quot;    Groups such as Westpride are becoming almost as common as Jaycees and Rotary clubs. In municipalities all across the country, people are asking the same questions: Will stores on Main Street survive the onslaught of malls? Will new projects overcrowd neighborhoods?    George Sternlieb, who heads the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy Research, believes that &quot;self-appointed groups&quot; are growing too powerful. He adds: &quot;You have a thousand groups with the power of naysay. It used to be a New York disease, but it's spreading.&quot;    The Upper West Side, an area of small shops, brownstones and other low-rise buildings, is one of the few places in Manhattan where people know their neighbors. That has helped Westpride. At brunches, neighborhood get-togethers and a $125-a-head cocktail party where the faithful feasted on liver pate and coconut-covered shrimp, it has raised $250,000. It got writers and celebrities to spread the word and enlisted grass-roots support by courting the area's liberal political culture.    Behind the scenes, it is dissecting Mr. Trump's proposal, pointing out perceived flaws to city officials and preparing for a lawsuit should he win city approval.    But Mr. Trump has a lot going for him. He has beaten civic groups before. He already owns the Trump City land. He need only get the city's approval. In theory, he can wait forever.    &quot;I'll get it zoned,&quot; he says. &quot;Whether it's now or later doesn't matter.&quot; In an interview in his skyscraper headquarters, he adds: &quot;All my life, people have been trying to stop me. Frankly, I look forward to the challenge.&quot;    Westpride, in contrast, can endure only as long as it keeps receiving checks. It was born in the kitchen of a free-lance writer and her husband who had invited three couples over to discuss whether they could block Mr. Trump's plan. Now, its office is in a basement. Yet in an organizing effort reminiscent of old-style ward politics, it has infiltrated practically every building on the Upper West Side, an area with 208,000 people.    And in two years, it has helped sway public opinion against Trump City. Concedes Alex Cooper, Mr. Trump's architect: &quot;There is a powerful sentiment out there that is anti-development.&quot;    Projected skyscrapers seem to unite in opposition widely diverse people. &quot;Development brings a whole panoply of constituencies together,&quot; says Dean Macris, San Francisco's director of planning.    Westpride feeds on common worries: air pollution, loss of sunlight, and the effects on small shops, traffic, transport, parks and general neighborhood livability. But the stakes are uncommon: the last big chunk of open land in mid-Manhattan. To Mr. Trump, the 76 acres of former railroad yards, on the edge of the Hudson River, are &quot;the best piece of land in America.&quot;    The four couples who formed Westpride are veterans of the anti-war movement of the 1960s and other causes. More recently, some had been working in small groups to limit other real-estate developments. After Mr. Trump announced his plan, they held their first meeting in the spring of 1986.    &quot;We knew we'd need an organization that was seriously funded,&quot; recalls Bruce Simon, a labor lawyer who, with his wife, Arlene, a landmark preservationist, was one of the founders. (The other founders were another lawyer, a Democratic Party organizer, a singer, a sculptor, a metal fabricator and an urban-affairs writer.) They decided to look for 50 families to put up $1,000 each for legal and other expenses. That took six months. Then, they hired a lawyer experienced in land-use litigation, a public-relations firm and two environmental consultants.    The lawyer, Peter Paden, had a plan: to use environmental laws &quot;as a vehicle for getting a voice in zoning.&quot; In New York, as in many places, developers must file environmental-impact statements. Such statements are broad, including a project's effects on air, water, housing costs, traffic, and shopping patterns. And because they require public comment, they enable citizen groups to insert themselves into the process. Westpride began firing off critiques to city agencies, alleging, for example, that the Trump plan lacks the legal minimum of open space.    As Westpride was organizing, it picked up an ally. The Municipal Art Society, an older civic group, was fighting a different project: a city-sponsored skyscraper next to Central Park. At Mrs. Simon's urging, the society hired Mr. Paden; soon afterward, it sued the city. Various Westpride people were involved, and Daniel Gutman, a Westpride consultant, says that fight &quot;was like a trial run for Trump City.&quot;    The art society got a lot of publicity thanks to its VIP members, including Jacqueline Onassis. Westpride, drawing on the example, recruited Isaac Asimov, Rex Reed, Joanne Woodward, James Taylor and Bill Moyers.    Robert Caro, an author, enlisted Patricia Bosworth, a writer who travels in glitzy circles and who would lose her river view if the Trump plan went ahead.    &quot;Everyone in the group knows a lot of people,&quot; she says. She met Mr. Trump at a party and nearly confronted him about the project, but her nerve failed. &quot;I was tongue-tied,&quot; she recalls. &quot;He was talking to Henry Kissinger.&quot;    Then, Westpride got lucky; the issue hit the front pages. Last summer, Mr. Trump pressed city hall for tax breaks to help him lure National Broadcasting Co. to his project. When the city refused, Mr. Trump attacked Mayor Edward Koch as &quot;incompetent&quot; and called for his resignation. The mayor called Mr. Trump &quot;piggy.&quot;    With the Koch-Trump war raging in New York's tabloids, a community hearing was held to assess the plan. Westpride sent thousands of mailers urging people to attend. On a fall evening, 1,200 people crammed into a high-school auditorium and heard a series of &quot;neutral experts&quot; pillory the project. Mr. Cooper, who represented Mr. Trump, was jeered.    Shortly afterward, NBC said it wouldn't move to the Trump site. Henry Kanegsberg, an official of the General Electric Co. unit, cited community fervor as a big reason. &quot;I live on the West Side, and we see what's going on there,&quot; he said.    In December, the art society won its suit. That and NBC's pullout created excitement. &quot;It was like smelling blood in the water,&quot; Steven Robinson, an architect and Westpride's co-chairman, says.    Last month, during a Westpride Week, 30 neighborhood parties were held to win recruits. Bernadette Brusco, a newcomer from San Antonio, Texas, invited 34 guests and raised $1,000. One of her neighbors, New Yorker cartoonist Mort Gerberg, pledged cartoons to help the cause. Another, an auction-house employee, said he would stage an auction. Andre Gregory, an actor and anti-nuclear activist, held a party to bring in theater people. Amy Newman, an art critic, invited her husband's lawyer friends. Westpride sent Mr. Paden to talk at her party &quot;because lawyers seem to be impressed by lawyers,&quot; she says. She raised $2,000.    One morning, Westpride volunteers are working the phones, organizing buildings and local merchants. Eva Lederman, a 71-year-old volunteer, is stuffing envelopes with literature. She had culled some of the names and addresses from past campaigns. Which campaigns? &quot;Almost all of them: Henry Wallace, Gene McCarthy, McGovern.&quot;    Sandor Katz, Westpride's 25-year-old executive director and its only paid staffer, hangs up the phone and announces that violinist Itzhak Perlman and his wife are planning to throw a fund-raiser.    &quot;In October, we had a mailing list of 400 active names,&quot; Mr. Katz says. &quot;Now, we have 1,600.&quot; He is filing Freedom of Information Act requests to find out which aspects of the Trump plan worry the city. &quot;Our strategy,&quot; he says, &quot;is to discover cracks in the plan and open them up.&quot;    Mr. Trump's aides say streets that they plan to add will absorb the additional people and traffic. They also say the project will add substantial parkland and won't displace anyone. And the population of the Upper West Side, they note, is roughly 25% smaller than in 1950.    But to some, the developer personifies the threat. &quot;In his yacht, his estate, he symbolizes excess,&quot; says Henry Stern, the city parks commissioner. &quot;Nobody wants to live in Donald Trump's shadow.&quot; Mr. Trump himself says: &quot;If it wasn't Donald Trump, they wouldn't care.&quot;    In a recent move to reduce the controversy, Mr. Trump has been quietly revising the plan to include housing for the elderly. He says he soon expects to formally propose the project to the city, which then would conduct a six-month review.    Edward Gordon, a real-estate broker, says, &quot;Donald Trump is a man who doesn't know how to lose.&quot; But as the project stands now, city officials, including Mayor Koch, say it is far too big, and Parks Commissioner Stern predicts that Mr. Trump &quot;is going to have enormous trouble because of community opposition.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
