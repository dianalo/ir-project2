The amount that will be set aside for the IRS hasn't beendisclosed. But U.S. Judge Milton Pollack of Manhattan, whohas jurisdiction over the case, said the amount fits into theoverall settlement of Drexel's bankruptcy-law case.</LP><TEXT>   It's believed that the IRS will receive only a smallfraction of what it had requested, because under the terms ofthe proposed settlement almost all of Drexel's $2.6 billionin assets will be distributed to creditors andsecurities-litigation claimants.   Judge Pollack, as well as Drexel and its creditors, haveaccused the IRS of seeking a grossly inflated claim. The IRSalleged that the $5.28 billion was owed for back taxes,interest and penalties for the years 1980 through 1990.   Judge Pollack gave the IRS until July 26 to get theJustice Department and the Treasury Department to sign off onthe tentative agreement. If the agreement falls apart, abankruptcy-court hearing would be held in early August todetermine how much the IRS should be paid. A hearing on thetax claim scheduled for today has been postponed.   Drexel is operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company continues tooperate but has court protection against creditors' lawsuitswhile it tries to work out a plan for paying its debts.   Attorneys for Drexel and its creditors have said that thebankruptcy-court settlement would be stymied if the IRS claimexceeded the amount set aside in the plan, which was notspecified. Drexel filed for bankruptcy-law protection inFebruary 1990.   Judge Pollack, who helped engineer the settlement, saidthe tentative accord with the IRS &quot;moves the plan a stepfurther forward. . . . I regard it as a highly desirableevent.&quot; Drexel expects to present its bankruptcyreorganization plan to creditors later this year.   Attorneys for Drexel and the IRS declined comment.   ---   EX-DREXEL OFFICIALS are warned: Cooperate or face FDIC incourt.   Attorneys for thrift regulators and for investors suingDrexel Burnham for securities fraud have sent a warningletter to 18 former top Drexel officials. The letter urgesthe former officials to cooperate with thesecurities-litigation claimants -- or else face possiblybeing added as a defendant.   Under the proposed settlement of Drexel's bankruptcy-courtcase, attorneys for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. andfor the investors have teamed up to pursue thesecurities-fraud claims, mainly stemming from the allegedrigging of the junk-bond market. Drexel also agreed to letthe securities claimants pursue claims that Drexel may haveagainst former employees, including allegations involvingwrongful conduct and excessive bonus payments.   The letter from Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach,representing investors, and Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, for theFDIC, says, &quot;These litigations will constitute a relentlesspursuit to recover moneys from any source where there isbelieved to have been wrongful conduct. Additional defendantswill be named in amended complaints expected to be filedduring the summer.&quot;   It added, &quot;We believe that you have information that maybe of assistance to us. In addition, we believe you are oneof the people whose activities bear investigation. We ask youto consult with your attorney and consider voluntarilycooperating with us.&quot;   Melvyn Weiss, of Milberg Weiss, said the letter was anunusual measure, but wasn't meant to be heavy-handed. &quot;It wassent to a very discreet list&quot; of former Drexel officials, hesaid. &quot;We cherrypicked the names of people we thought couldbe of help, or whose conduct we thought should be looked at.&quot;   Mr. Weiss said the law firms have been contacted byattorneys for some of the ex-Drexel officials, and that theletters have &quot;opened the means of communication.&quot; MilbergWeiss represents investors in dozens of suits involvingDrexel. The FDIC has sued Michael Milken and other ex-Drexelemployees, claiming they were responsible for massivesavings-and-loan losses.   Mr. Milken, formerly Drexel's junk bond chief, has deniedthe allegations. He is serving a 10-year sentence forseparate securities-law violations.   ---   SUBURBS MAY RECRUIT white home buyers, court rules.   Communities trying to prevent themselves from becomingpredominately black may actively seek white home buyers, afederal court in Chicago ruled.   The U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that aplan to attract whites to a Chicago suburb promoted by theSouth Suburban Housing Center, a fair-housing agency, did notviolate the federal Fair Housing Act.   The decision -- the first by a federal appeals court toaddress the issue -- is a victory for proponents ofaffirmative marketing plans. They argue that courting whitehome buyers is a legitimate way to guarantee a racially mixedcommunity and check the drop of property values that oftenresults from white flight. Many suburban towns near Chicagoand Cleveland have adopted such plans.   In the Chicago case, the National Association of Realtors,which opposes affirmative marketing, challenged a planpromoted by the South Suburban Housing Center, in which localreal estate agents promised to agree to find whites to buyhomes in Park Forest, a Chicago suburb. The Realtorsassociation contended that the contract violated the federalFair Housing Act and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution,which requires that all races be treated equally.   In his opinion, Judge John L. Coffey ruled that the planpromoted the goals of the federal law and that the Realtorsgroup failed to produce evidence that blacks were discouragedfrom buying the homes.   &quot;We disagree with the Realtors' argument that increasedcompetition among black and white home buyers for the samehomes constitutes a violation of the Fair Housing Act,&quot; hewrote.   The court did not address the constitutional question,because it ruled that the proper plaintiff to bring such anaction would be a black home-seeker.   Philip Stahl, an attorney for the Realtors group, said itis considering asking for a rehearing by the entire appealscourt or filing for a review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Theappeals court, Mr. Stahl contended, ignored evidence thatsuggested the center had a racist intent behind its plan.   Alexander Polikoff, an attorney for the center, said theruling &quot;clears up the uncertainty that this is {racial}steering or some other unlawful activity,&quot; even though theconstitutional question was not addressed.</TEXT></DOC>
