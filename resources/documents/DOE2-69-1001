Generation of sulfur oxidesis being steadily reduced in Europe by the decreasing consumption offossil fuels, but the reduction of nitrogen oxides is not affirmativedue to the activation of transportation. The acid rain is vastly affectingforests, the fishery and buildings. West European countries have adoptedthe protocol for control of trans-border pollution and are making effortsto reduce the sulfur oxides by 30% until 1995 as compared with 1980.Efforts for controlling nitrogen oxides are also initiated. While thecircumstance in North America is similar to that of Europe, a sharp argumentis continued between Canada and the U.S. which takes certain negativestands on the pollution control. The pollution in Japan is not seriousas the buffering action to acid rain is high and the pollution is strictlyregulated, but careful provisions are necessary. (7 figs, 13 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
