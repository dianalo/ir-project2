This report outlines its propertiesand its present day uses such as the space program, welding of metals,controlled atmospheres for growing crystals for semi-conductors, chromatography,heat transfer, leak-testing, and research and medical-biological applications.It also appears that liquid helium will be necessary to provide a practicalsource of the low temperature necessary for the many potential applicationsof superconductivity. These offer many possibilities for savings in energy-relatedapplications. This report also examines helium supply and demand in theUSA, the principal source of supply to the Western world, Japan, whichmust import all its requirements, and Canada. Since the failure of CanadianHelium's Saskatchewan plant in 1977, Canada has no indigenous supplyand no apparent sources which are viable under current technology. Albertahad 33.1 billion feet/sup 3/ of helium as of December 31, 1977 containedin its proved reserves of natural gas. None of this is economically recoverableunder current commercial technology. By 1985, when a commercial plantwould come on stream, 72% of the ultimate reserve of 47 Bcf will stillbe available. Alberta now has a process being field-tested which hasan energy requirement only 25-30% of that of the presently availablemethod. Should the test be successful, it will make possible the economicrecovery of helium from the province's pipeline gases and the sale ofthe technology to other countries. 17 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
