Maybe you don't.;   Thispackage of information is designed to help moderate- and low-income first-timebuyers figure out what they can afford -- and how to get help paying for it.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE HOMESTRETCHHELP FOR FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  A San Jose Mercury News special report; See also related article on page 3D ofthis section.; This article has been retyped for the data base.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The good news is that there are a number of new or modified subsidyprograms available and mortgage interest rates are very attractive. The badnews is that even with slumping prices, Bay Area homes remain expensive andout of many people's reach.;   But we hope prospective buyers reading thispackage may find a program or tip that can help them -- if not now, maybe afew years down the road. And you may just be surprised that home ownershipisn't quite as far out of reach as everyone's been telling you.; TIPS FOREASIER QUALIFYING:; PAY OFF THE CAR; For every $250 in car payments aprospective borrower is obligated for, the size of the mortgage he or shequalifies for drops $21,000, based on current interest rates. The smallerother debts are, the bigger the loan one can qualify for -- so lenders adviseputting off buying a new car or paying off the current car loan, if possible.;SHARE THE COSTS; Recent rule changes now allow buyers to reduce the amount ofclosing costs by asking the seller to pay the first year's private mortgageinsurance premium, which is required when the down payment is less than 20percent. Savings could range from $1,500 to $1,800. Buyers can negotiate withsellers to pay many types of closing costs, allowing buyers to make biggerdown payments.; SUBSIDIZE THE INTEREST RATE; To qualify for a larger loan,negotiate with the seller to subsidize the interest rate for a couple ofyears, by which time your household income has increased to meet payments atthe unsubsidized rate. It's known as a &quot;2-1 buy down&quot;. For sellers, the costis usually less than what they'd have to drop the price by to entice anotherbuyer.; CHECK YOUR AFFILIATIONS; Active or retired teachers, governmentworkers, AFL-CIO union members, military personnel and veterans, among others,are entitled to special subsidy programs.; USE YOUR FEDERAL MORTGAGE CREDIT;Mortgage credit certificates, a program that allows you to pay less federaltax, are becoming more useful, especially for larger families, as the maximumhome sales price and income limits have been raised in many locales. Lendersin essence will treat the reduced taxes as increased income and enable you toqualify for a bigger loan and a bigger house.; SOME LOANS REQUIRE ONLY ALITTLE DOWN; Some new loan programs only require the buyer to come up with 3percent of the down payment as cash out of pocket. The other 2 percent can bea gift or unsecured loan from a relative or government or non-profit agency.Such a loan requires a steady and sizable income, however. That's because alender must be assured that you can make the payments on the mortgage, whichgiven the small down payment will likely be quite large.; KEEP PAYING YOURBILLS; Using new, more flexible qualifying criteria, some lenders will nowconsider such untraditional things as a good history of making utility billpayments. They will not require as large cash reserves in the bank and in somecases allow borrowers to put up to 40 percent of their monthly income towardhousing -- if they can prove they've been spending that much on rent for anextended period of time. Lenders advise borrowers to work at establishing agood credit record.; EMPLOYER AND UNION PROGRAMS; Certain employees andretirees are eligible for housing programs that provide easier qualifying andsome subsidies. Check with your employer or union. Some of the bigger programsare listed on page 3D; Mortgage Credit certificate; The mortgage creditcertificate allows borrowers to deduct 20 percent of their annual mortgageinterest payments from the taxes they owe or to increase their exemptions atwork to immediately see increased income. Lenders will treat the tax savingsas increased income, enabling borrowers to qualify for a bigger loan.;   ...;WHO'S ELIGIBLE: Santa Clara County residents, except San Jose; residents;  OFINCOME LIMITS       HOUSE PRICE LIMITS       WHO TO CALL; $57,700 for 1 or 2      $220,000 for resale    (408) 299-4711; $66,355 for 3 or more    $250,000for new; ...; WHO'S ELIGIBLE: San Jose residents;  OF INCOME LIMITS      HOUSE PRICE LIMITS       WHO TO CALL; $57,700 for 1 or 2       $186,390 forresale    (408) 299-4711; $66,355 for 3 or more    $220,590 for new; ...;WHO'S ELIGIBLE: Alameda County residents;  OF INCOME LIMITS       HOUSE PRICELIMITS       WHO TO CALL; $48,500 for 1 or 2       $209,835 for resale   (415) 670-5799; $55,700 for 3 or more    $236,270 for new; ...; WHO'SELIGIBLE: Santa Cruz County residents;  OF INCOME LIMITS       HOUSE PRICELIMITS       WHO TO CALL; $43,400 for 1 or 2       $205,470 for resale   (408)425-2471; $47,750 for 3 or more    $235,440 for new;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; Home MortgagePurchase Program; The California Housing Finance Agency offers a variety ofprograms for first-time home buyers.
