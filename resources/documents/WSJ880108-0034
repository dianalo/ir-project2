As part of the consolidation, Pittsburgh-based Mellon said it will stop processing automated teller machine transactions in the five states served by CoreStates' MAC system. A Mellon spokeswoman said the bank holding company will continue managing an automated teller machine network in 19 other states.    The consolidated network will serve a total of 538 financial institutions, Mellon said.    Conversion to the new network will begin about April 1 and is expected to be completed by year end, Mellon said. </TEXT></DOC>
