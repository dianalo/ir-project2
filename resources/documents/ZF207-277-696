 Once suchcritical information is on a database, according to Chabrowe, you have toprovide access to everyone who needs it.andM;Several techniques are available for sharing access to databases on theMacintosh.andP;  With a simple AppleTalk network, it's easy to ship files from Macto Mac.andP;  Such a method, however, does not allow several users to access adatabase simultaneously.andM;With a client-and-server arrangement, key data stays on one machine, but youuse remote access software to work with it from another location.andP;  Withoutspecial features in the database program, only one user can connect to thedatabase at a time.andM;Lock step.andP;  With a true multiuser database, operations by one user don'tnecessarily lock out other users.andP;  Instead, users are prevented from changingany part of a file that is currently in use (&quot;file locking&quot;) or from changinga particular record that is in use (&quot;record locking&quot;).andP;  In most systems, evenwhen a lock is in effect other users can continue to read the affected file.andM;AppleTalk's AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) now supports records locking.andP;  Somedatabases that were written before the multi-user feature was added, however,use their own record- or file-locking methods.andP;  In addition, major networksthat support the Macintosh, such as Novell's NetWare and 3Com's 3Com forMacintosh, support AFP and add the security features that mos corporationsneed for multi-user systems.andP;  As a result, according to database experts,most major single-user databases on the Macintosh will eventually addmulti-user features.andM;Several databases on the Mac, however, already feature a mutli-user mode.andM;ACIUS' 4th Dimension, a purely Macintosh database that has won plaudits forits ease of customization and its point-and-click interface, is one of theeasiest Mac programs to run in multi-user mode, according to Will Mayall,ACIUS vice president to engineering.andP;  &quot;You can take the same database thatyou've been using in [single-user mode] to multi-user by simply holding downthe mouse button when you start the program.&quot;andP;  A good multi-user database onthe Mac should keep all the ease of use and directness of a Mac-stleinterface with as few changes as possible.andP;  Mayall said.andM;Easing the transition to multi-user access has also been a concern at ClarisCorp., according to Dennis Marshall, product manager for FileMaker II.andO;Multi-user capability has traditionally been associated with high-endrelational databases (which combine data from several files) and databaseprogramming languages.andP;  But the popular and easy-to-use FileMaker II canfunction in multi-user mode with &quot;no more effort than opening the right fileon the network,&quot; said Marshall.andM;Multi-mediums.andP;  A database needn't be relational to be multi-user, accordingto Marshall.andP;  &quot;The ability to share the information has absolutely nothing todo wht the complexity of the data,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You can have a simple customerlist that you share across the whole company.&quot;andM;Another Macintosh-only database, 1st File from 1st Desk Systems Inc. providesa much more limited type of file sharing.andP;  In 1st File, reference files areshared but work files are not.andP;  &quot;Essentially, being a read-only operation tothe source files and a write operation to the work files, any number of userscan read the source files,&quot; said Ned Hinds, 1st Desk's sales manager.andP;  Oncethe work files are completed, they can be merged back into the referencefiles.andM;However, for many corporate users the uniqueness and familiarity of theMacintosh graphical interface must be balanced against another goal, the needfor a multi-user database to run across multiple hardware platforms.andP;  Such aneed is most apparent in companies where Macintoshes are being added toplatforms and databases.andM;&quot;One of the requirements for having a 'corporate data system' was that usersdidn't have to give up their desktop,&quot; said Jeff Menz, a systems analyst atGenentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif.andP;  The biotechnology company hasbeen examining the possibility of using the Oracle database on the Macintoshas front end for Oracle and other databases run-ning on Digital EquipmentCorp.'s VAX minicomputers.andP;  With this approach, users on other platforms canhave their choice of structured query language (SQL)-based programs.andM;Right now, said Mark Banioff, director of the Macintosh team at Oracle, itsMacintosh database implementations are multi-user only when connected with aback end on a larger system.andP;  &quot;We only support multi-user databases onsystems that are true multi-user,&quot; he said.andP;  When the Macintosh operatingsystem itself becomes multi-user, he added, it's probable that Oracle willadd this features to its Macintosh version.andM;No change in the operating system is needed for several other multiplatformprograms, however.andP;  Fox Software's FoxBASE+/Mac, for example, runs inmulti-user mode on Macintoshes, PCs and mixed networks.andP;  The program, whichis considered to be one of the speediest databases available on theMacintosh, is a Macified version of Fox's original DOS impelementation of thedBASE language and data structures.andP;  On a network using the Mac's AFP lockingmechanism, it can lock at the file or record level.andM;New interfaces.andP;  Blyth Software's Macintosh Omnis 5 also runs in multi-usermode on mixed PC and Macintosh networks, allowing users to have access tofiles on either Macintoshes or on PCs running Omnis 5.andP;  The program, due toship this month, uses an upgraded version of the multi-user database enginefound in Blyth's Omnis 3.3 program along with a new user interface.andP;  It canbe programmed to access SQL databases and includes HyperCard externalcommands (XCMDs).andM;Odesta's Double Helix, on the other hand, doesn't run on PCs but on networkscontaining VAXes and Macintosh workstations.andP;  The program, which manyconsider to be even more graphical than the Macintosh itself, is a relationaldatabase with an iconic language that employs a data-flow model rather thancommands.andP;  While some database programs may be a bit faster, Double Helixboth runs fast and provides a sophisticated data model, which guaranteesintegrity even when files are scattered across several machines, according toDaniel Cheifetz, Odesta founder and president.andM;Chabrowe said that for his use, the Double Helix approach has been a greatsuccess because it addresses his concerns about reliability, access,simplicity and security.andP;  &quot;After that it's a question of style,&quot; he said, &quot;Inmy own case, I prefer the icon approach, but you have to look at it on aproject-by-project basis.&quot;andM;Even on the Macintosh, no one database can be all things to all people, saidDon Nanneman, Apple database evangelist.andP;  The underlying technology andstructure are important, he said, but so is the user experience.andP;  &quot;One of thenice things about the Mac-intosh is that people are more interested in whatcan they do with it rather than with technical distinctions.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
