Premier Ruud Lubbers, the nation's charismatic and highly popularleader since 1982, is likely to retain his post. But pre-electionpolls indicate he may need to turn to the opposition Labor Party toform his third government.   Lubbers has not ruled out any party as his future coalitionpartner, reflecting the mainstream position traditionally taken byhis Christian Democrats.   Lubbers' government fell in May when the right-wing Liberals,junior partners in his center-right coalition government, resistedhis $3.3 billion plan to clean up the heavily polluted Dutch air,soil and waterways by the year 2010.   The Liberals object to a $296 million provision of the plan thatcalls for cutting income tax deductions for people who use theircars to get to work.   The Liberals say the provision singles out one group, whileLubbers argues that eliminating the deduction would cut exhaustemissions and ease highway congestion.   It was the first time a Western government had fallen over anenvironmental issue. Lubbers, whose government is now in caretakerstatus, called early elections that had been set for May 1990.   The Cabinet crisis reflected not only concern for theenvironment, but also years of irritation between Lubbers and theLiberals, who balked at having to swallow Christian Democraticprograms.   ``The environment is a very fashionable issue at the top of thepolitical agenda ... but as to what the parties are trying toachieve, I haven't discovered all that much difference,'' Liberallawmaker Jan te Veldhuis told The Associated Press.   Te Veldhuis added that his party, like Lubbers', would continuewith the National Environmental Policy Plan engineered in part byEnvironment Minister Ed Nijpels, himself a Liberal, but wouldcontinue to resist eliminating the deduction for car-drivingcommuters.   High unemployment and Lubbers' economic recovery program also areamong the top issues facing voters.   According to a poll published last week, Lubbers' ChristianDemocratic Appeal party will lose one of its 54 seats in the150-seat Parliament, with the Labor Party of opposition leader WimKok keeping its current 52 seats.   The poll by the Inter@View organization in Amsterdam said theLiberals will lose five of their 27 seats.   Most electoral gains are projected to go to smaller groups oneither side of the political spectrum, including Green Left, anupstart amalgam of environmentalists and anti-NATO activists thatcould become the nation's fourth-largest party.   The telegenic Lubbers, 50, enjoys wide popularity in theNetherlands because he is credited with restoring confidence in thenation's economy and spurring consumer spending.   He has combined a gradual lowering of private and corporate taxeswith cuts in social programs to slash the $12.4 billion budgetdeficit, which represents 7.1 percent of net national income.   He has also promised to cut the 11.3 percent unemployment rateand foster economic growth.   In 1985, Lubbers proved his skills as a consensus builder byengineering the acceptance on Dutch soil of 48 U.S. cruise missilesin defiance of a large opposition movement. The missiles wereultimately not placed because of the U.S.-Soviet accord oneliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles.   Even the left-wing magazine De Tijd noted last week that Lubbershas the aura of a ``mild, wise statesman ... he speaks perfectly,and is reason itself.''   But to his critics, Lubbers represents the arrogance of a partylikely to be the centerpiece of Dutch governments for theforeseeable future.   The Christian Democrats or their predecessor parties have been inevery postwar ruling coalition. No single group has ever garneredenough votes for a parliamentary majority.   By contrast, Kok, former head of the nation's largest labororganization, the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions, has failed toproject as forceful a public image.   De Tijd called Kok ``drab and boring'' and said ``He's awkward inhis movements. He's all smiles, waves a little, but sits down fartoo soon'' at election rallies.   Labor wants to boost buying power for low-income families, whichhas been falling steadily during the Lubbers era. It also wants tofight unemployment by shortening the standard 38-hour working weekto 32 hours in most industries.</TEXT></DOC>
