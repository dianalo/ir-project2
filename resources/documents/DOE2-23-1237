Using antibodies specific for human brain{alpha}-spectrin ({alpha}-fodrin), the authors cloned a rat brain {alpha}-spectrincDNA from an expression library. Several closely related human cloneswere also isolated by hybridization. Comparison of sequences of theseand other overlapping nonerythroid and erythroid {alpha}-spectrin genesdemonstrated that the nonerythroid genes are strictly conserved acrossspecies, while the mammalian erythroid genes have diverged rapidly. Peptidesequences deduced from these cDNAs revealed that the nonerythroid {alpha}-spectrinchain, like the erythroid spectrin, is composed of multiple 106-amino-acidrepeating units, with the characteristic invariant tryptophan as wellas other charged and hydrophobic residues in conserved locations. However,the carboxy-terminal sequence varies markedly from this internal repeatpattern and may represent a specialized functional site. The nonerythroid{alpha}-spectrin gene was mapped to human chromosome 9, in contrast tothe erythroid {alpha}-spectrin gene, which has previously been assignedto a locus on chromosome 1.</TEXT></DOC>
