(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cancer researchers at the Mayo Clinichave found positive effects from twice-a-day doses of radiation _ avariation from traditional once-a-day treatments _ combined withcancer-fighting drugs.   ``It's premature to give results, but this approach oftwice-a-day radiation, with or without chemotherapy, appears to beone of the most promising approaches we have,'' Edward Shaw, aradiation oncologist, told a seminar on smoking last weekend.   The researchers have been studying the new approach for thosewho are not good candidates for surgery since the summer of 1987.   But the National Cancer Institute was hesitant Tuesday toendorse the new treatment, saying the benefits must be shown tooutweigh the problems it could inflict.   While ``it's definitely something that needs to be looked intofurther,'' two-a-day treatments could disrupt patient's lives byrequiring them to remain hospitalized, said spokeswoman Kara Smigel.   Those getting once-a-day treatment are usually outpatients andcan live relatively normal lives, she said.   About 155,000 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 1989.Of those, about two-thirds will not be good candidates for surgery.   If patients receive two radiation treatments daily, lower dosesmay spare the tissue surrounding fast-growing cancers, Shaw said.Traditional radiation treatment for lung cancer calls for radiationonce a day, five days a week, for six weeks.   That, said Shaw, will produce a 5 percent survival rate, meaning5 percent of the patients receiving the treatment will be alive infive years. Twenty percent will be alive after two years. Theaverage survival will be nine months.   Most people die from the spread of the cancer to other areas,such as the brain, liver and bones, Shaw said.   ``I hate to get too excited too soon, but these people are doingreally well,'' Shaw said. ``This is probably the most excitingpotential development I have seen in inoperable lung cancer inyears.''   A 20-patient pilot program using twice-a-day radiation willbegin in about six weeks. The next stage will be to comparestandard treatment with twice-a-day radiation and twice-a-dayradiation with chemotherapy. Researchers should have some idea ofthe effectiveness of the treatment within four or five years.</TEXT></DOC>
