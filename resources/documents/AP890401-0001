DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Boston's top federal prosecutor announced Fridayhe would not file criminal charges against Senate President WilliamBulger after a 2{-year investigation, but he hinted broadly thatcorruption persists in Massachusetts.   Outgoing U.S. Attorney Jeremiah O'Sullivan, as one of his lastofficial acts, told a crowded news conference that he had decidednot to indict Bulger or his associate, Boston attorney ThomasFinnerty, who was accused of extortion in a development project.   ``There is simply not sufficient evidence to ask a grand jury toindict either of these two individuals for violation of the federalextortion statute or the federal tax laws,'' O'Sullivan said.   After a two-month review of a 2{-year-long federalinvestigation, O'Sullivan said the final decision was ``not a closecall'' based on the admissible evidence in the exhaustivelyresearched case. The review had been ordered by U.S. AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh.   But in reply to reporters' questions, O'Sullivan indicated hispersonal belief that the development business is rife with tacticsthat are questionable, although not indictable.   ``Power-brokering is not necessarily a federal crime,'' he said.At another point, O'Sullivan said the tactics involve``influence-peddling.''   The decision by O'Sullivan helps lift a cloud of suspicion fromBulger, one of the state's most powerful politicians, who wasrocked by allegations made by Boston landlord and developer HaroldBrown in a civil suit.   In a civil suit filed in Suffolk Superior Court, Brown chargedthat Finnerty, a long-time associate and law partner of Bulger,extorted $500,000 from him by suggesting that he could hampergovernmental approval of an office building development in Bostonunless he was cut in on the deal.   Brown accused Bulger of benefiting from the pay-off.   Bulger and Finnerty denounced those allegations, but Bulger haslargely refrained from defending himself in public. An aide saidthe Senate president would make no comment on the prosecutor'sdecision not to press charges.   Brown, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to bribing a City Hallofficial to expedite another of his projects, was apparently thegovernment's key witness in the case. O'Sullivan said Brown mayhave sincerely believed Finnerty was trying to extort him, but theprosecutor said the criminal issue was Finnerty's actions _ notBrown's perceptions.</TEXT></DOC>
