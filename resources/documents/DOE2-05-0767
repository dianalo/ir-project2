The development of gene probes holds great promise for followingthe rate of introduced organisms and their genomes, but achieving sufficientsensitivity has proven difficult. Colony hybridization approaches fortracking microorganisms have the same limitations as other cultural methods,namely the inability of such methods to culture all organisms in a sample.Methods using direct extraction of nucleic acids from soils, sediments,and waters, followed by hybridization with radiolabeled probes have beendeveloped, but most have a lower limit of sensitivity of about 10,000cells per gram for the detection of bacteria. Extraction of the totalmicrobial community genome also permits the determination of communitygenetic diversity, a very useful measure of environmental stress anddisturbance on microbial communities. In some cases the proposed releaseof genetically engineered microorganisms would occur after another environmentaldisturbance, such as an environmental release of a toxic substance orother pollutant, with the aim of restoring the ecological balance ofan ecosystem.</TEXT></DOC>
