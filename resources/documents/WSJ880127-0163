The price wasn't disclosed, but analysts estimated it at less than #10 million ($17 million). The British bank announced last week that it would shed its London and Hong Kong institutional-equity operations as part of its accord to sell a 14.9% stake to Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp.    SOLVAY S.A., Belgium's largest chemicals company, said group earnings for all of 1987 rose in line with the 23% increase posted for the first half. Solvay, which won't release full-year figures until April, said the &quot;favorable&quot; trend of the first half continued in the final six months. In the first half, earnings rose to 5.99 billion Belgian francs ($171.4 million) from 4.86 billion francs a year earlier, despite a 2% decline in sales, to 110.57 billion francs from 112.86 billion francs.    AB VOLVO said 1987 car sales slipped 0.2% from 1986, to 418,600 units, slower than what it said was a 3% decline in sales of cars by all makers. The Swedish auto maker said that while sales fell in the U.S., its share of the U.S. market rose. Sales fell slightly in Western Europe but grew sharply in Asia. &quot;We have every reason to be pleased with the past year,&quot; said Roger Holback, president and chief executive officer of the car division. </TEXT></DOC>
