Fonar also said it expects to report that earnings for the year ended June 30 rose &quot;slightly&quot; from fiscal 1986.    Fonar makes magnetic resonance scanners, which create pictures of body organs for medical diagnoses using sound waves. Because of a flurry of recent orders, the backlog now stands at a record $31.4 million, compared with $22.3 million a year ago.    A spokesman said more hospitals and private physicians are either replacing their CAT scanners, which provide computer-enhanced X-rays of body organs, or are augmenting those machines with magnetic resonance scanners.    In fiscal 1986, Fonar earned $2.6 million, or 16 cents a share, on sales of $36.7 million.    The company had nine-month net income of $1.8 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $31.1 million.    Fonar closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $5.625 a share, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
