The staff report, ``Targeting of U.S. Agricultural ExportSubsidies,'' used four theoretical cases involving thesubsidization of wheat and corn exports to selected countries wheresubsidized foreign competition _ notably the EEC _ has undercutU.S. sales.   It concludes that while U.S. farmers would benefit from higherexport revenues, ``domestic consumers will be hurt.''   ``Given the effect of U.S. subsidies on the world wheat and cornmarkets, other exporters would not likely remain passive'' whilethe United States increases its market share at their expense.   ``All four cases show gains to the subsidy programs in terms ofnet export revenue, even if the EEC targets its wheat subsidies tomaximize its export revenue,'' the report said. ``Most gains comefrom the subsidization of wheat rather than of corn.''   The report added: ``Given the objective of export revenuemaximization, the United States does not have the power to coercethe EEC into a weakened export position. Also, the net (annual)cost to the United States of such a program would be about $1billion.''   The United States has insisted that agricultural trade barriers,including direct and non-direct subsidies, should be eliminatedover the next decade or so.   But the EEC, the main target of such a plan, has rebuffed theidea as unrealistic and unworkable.   At last week's round of trade talks in Brainerd, Minn.,involving the United States, Canada, Japan and the EEC, negotiatorsremained far apart on the farm subsidy issue.   Even so, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said theUnited States was not willing to modify its demands and wouldcontinue to seek the reforms, at least for now.   Yeutter also said Congress might increase U.S. export subsidies,as it did in 1985, if negotiations stall.   The study was prepared as ``a theoretical analysis'' by StephenL. Haley of the department's Economic Research Service, who saidits purpose was to assess U.S. ability to influence world wheat andcorn markets through ``an actively supported targeted exportsubsidy program.'' A copy was provided at the request of TheAssociated Press.   Such a program has been in operation for three years as theExport Enhancement Program, or EEP. Under it, exporters are paidsubsidies, or ``bonuses'' of surplus government-owned commodities,so they can sell wheat, corn or other designated products toselected foreign countries at reduced prices.   ``In all four cases, the benefits to the wheat and cornproducing sectors do not outweigh the subsidy costs,'' the reportsaid. ``In all four cases, losses of $1 billion (a year) occur innational welfare. The drive to maximize export revenue is notself-financing.''   Not only would other countries likely to retaliate, large shiftsin trading patterns might violate restrictions in the 94-nationGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on ``inequitable'' marketshares, the report said.   ``The United States would be more vulnerable in the world wheatmarket because its world wheat market share is considerably lessthan its corn share,'' the report said.   It added: ``Although Canada and Australia could conceivablyretaliate for the U.S. program, it is the EEC, judged by its pastbehavior, that would be the likely candidate to take retaliatoryaction in the world wheat market.''   The Reagan administration has been under pressure from some farmgroups and members of Congress to continue the Export EnhancementProgram at its recent high level, even though drought has raiseduncertainties about U.S. grain production this year.   But Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng says it's too early tomake a firm commitment on EEP, because more needs to be known aboutU.S. and world grain supplies for 1988-89.   ``But I'll tell you this,'' he said last week. ``We will notneglect our export trade.''</TEXT></DOC>
