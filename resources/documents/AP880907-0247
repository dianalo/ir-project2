On the New York Mercantile Exchange today, the October contractfor delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade ofU.S. crude, was down 9 cents a barrel at $14.15 at late morning.The contract dropped 55 cents a barrel on Tuesday. Crude priceshave not traded that low on the exchange since October 1986, whenthey reached $13.73 per barrel.   Responding to the drop, several major U.S. oil companiesannounced Tuesday and today that they were cutting the officialprice they pay for West Texas Intermediate in the spot market.   Futures contracts for refined oil products traded on theexchange also continued Tuesday's decline. Wholesale unleadedgasoline for October delivery had fallen 0.33 cent a gallon to42.20 cents at late morning, while wholesale heating oil forOctober was down 0.23 cent at 41.48.   The market's skepticism about the ability of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to trim its outputhas deepened in recent days, after initial optimism aboutcooperation within the cartel resulting from the cease-fire betweenmembers Iran and Iraq.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto recently capped off a series ofmeetings with oil producers by visiting officials in Iran and Iraq,and tried to persuade Iran to allow Iraq a higher production quota.But Subroto made little headway in his efforts to win cooperationamong OPEC members for curbing overall output.   ``There just doesn't seem to be any hope right now,'' said LindaSimard, an oil futures broker at the investment firm Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. ``Subroto didn't seem to be getting anywhere.''   The Middle East Economic Survey, an influential weekly publishedin Nicosia, Cyprus, reported last week that total OPEC productionwas estimated at 20 million barrels a day, more than 3.5 millionbarrels over the cartel's official ceiling.   The cease-fire between the Persian Gulf rivals after eight yearsof fighting frees Iran and Iraq to rebuild their war-damaged oilindustries, raising the prospect of a fresh surge in oil productionand a fall in crude prices.   A key to controlling any increased production, analysts say, isOPEC's ability to bring Iraq back under its discipline.   Iraq during the war past ignored its OPEC daily production quotaof 1.54 million barrels, demanding a share equal to Iran's 2.37million barrels a day. Iraq pumps an estimated 2.8 million barrelsa day, analysts say.   ``There's too much oil right now. OPEC is showing a completelack of discipline,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of theenergy group at Elders Futures Inc.   The price slide will not necessarily mean a break for driversfilling up at the pump. While crude oil price declines often bringprice cuts in gasoline that is refined from crude, gasoline demandnow is unusually strong in the United States and supplies arefairly tight, analysts say.   ``We really don't expect a significant impact to be felt ongasoline prices,'' said William Veno, director of oil marketanalysis at Data Resources Inc., a consulting firm based inLexington, Mass.   Several big oil refiners, meanwhile, cut the prices they arewilling to pay for West Texas Intermediate. Exxon Corp. and ChevronCorp. reduced their posted price by 25 cents a barrel, to $14.50.Texaco Inc., Sun Co., Phillips Petroleum Co., Marathon PetroleumCorp., Diamond Shamrock Randamp;M Inc., Conoco Inc. and Citgo PetroleumCorp. lowered their postings for WTI by 50 cents a barrel, to $14.</TEXT></DOC>
