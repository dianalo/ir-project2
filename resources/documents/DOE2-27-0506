<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0506 </DOCNO><TEXT>The dependence of ion beam mixing in Fe-Al and Fe-Cu bilayers on the energyof bombarding Kr/sup +/ ions has been investigated by using the techniqueof conversion electron Moessbauer spectroscopy. The ion energy has beenvaried over a range between 30 keV and 120 keV but keeping the dose valuefixed at 10/sup 16/ ions/cm/sup 2/. In both the cases the extent of mixingshows an interesting variation with increase in the value of ion energy.This behaviour is discussed in the light of the calculated energy depositiondistributions for the cases of the given bilayer systems. The variationsin the microstructural details of the mixed region with change in theincident ion energy have also been brought out via determination of hyperfineinteraction parameters.</TEXT></DOC>
