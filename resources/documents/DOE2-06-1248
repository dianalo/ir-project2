A decrease of the /sup 13/C isotopic content of the treerings is observed starting from 1940 coinciding with a significant increasein the global production of CO/sub 2/ due to combustion of fossil fueldepleted in /sup 13/C with respect to the atmosphere. Considering thelocal as well as the global CO/sub 2/ production rates together withthe measured isotopic data, it may be concluded that the behaviour ofcarbon dioxide in the investigated Eastern Delta province in Egypt reflectsmainly a global rather than a local effect.</TEXT></DOC>
