The new company, which will be among Canada's 20 largestoil and gas concerns, will be sold to the public through aseries of share issues beginning in 1994, the two partnerssaid.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We have created a company which is already a major playerin our industry, and with every prospect of growing stillfurther before we sell the shares to the . . . public,&quot; saidDon Stacy, chairman and president of Amoco Canada Petroleum.   Amoco Canada put up properties in the province of Albertawhich match those owned by Dow Chemical Canada Inc.'s MaligneResources Ltd. unit to form Crestar, Amoco Canada officialssaid. Crestar will have average production of 20,000 barrelsof oil and natural gas liquids daily and over 150 millioncubic feet of gas a day.   Coming from Amoco Canada, where he was senior vicepresident, production, Murray Todd is president and chiefexecutive of Crestar. He said he expects the new company toreport cash flow of 65 million Canadian dollars (US$54.9million) in the ten months ending Dec. 31, 1992, an estimatehe says is based on oil prices remaining at about $20 abarrel. He declined to estimate earnings or the company'sasset value, pending a recapitalization of Crestar, which isbased in Calgary, Alberta.   A top priority for Crestar's management will be improvingproduction at most of the Alberta properties it operates. Mr.Todd said he has earmarked Crestar's 1992 capital spendingbudget of C$40 million for development drilling at keylocations, with about 66 wells planned by the end of theyear. Once production has been increased, he says, Crestarwill move on to more exploratory ventures.   Currently, Crestar has proven reserves of 45 millionbarrels of oil and liquids and 573 billion cubic feet ofnatural gas.   The creation and future public sale of Crestar will helpAmoco Canada meet its commitments to Canada's foreigninvestment regulators to sell up to 20% of its stock to thepublic by 1998, a condition for approval of its 1988acquisition of troubled Canadian oil giant Dome PetroleumLtd.   Mr. Todd said none of Amoco's corporate debt will betransferred along with the oil and gas properties, and thatfollowing the recapitalization of Crestar, debt willrepresent less than 35% of the company's total capital.   The formation of Crestar leaves Amoco Canada withextensive oil and gas production operations throughoutwestern Canada. By releasing its Maligne Resources unit toform Crestar, Dow Canada quits the oil and gas industry tofocus on its key chemicals business. Parent companies AmocoCorp. and Dow Chemical are based, respectively, in Chicagoand Midland, Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
