(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state police officer who complainedabout a ``sex quiz'' handed out at a training session is underinvestigation for sending a copy to alert his boss, his attorneysaid.   ``To make a complaint about sexually offensive material, andthen be charged with distributing sexually offensive material forcomplaining, it just defies description,'' attorney Alan Legum saidWednesday.   ``We think this has a tremendous chilling effect, especially onminorities,'' said Legum, who represents Department of NaturalResources Officer Michael G. Sewell.   Sewell, president of the Black Officers' Association, said inhis May 10 letter to DNR Secretary Torrey C. Brown that the quiz hecalled sexist reminded him of a file of racist jokes that sparked a1985 lawsuit against the department.   Sewell enclosed a copy of the ``Official Game Warden Sex Quiz,''which had been distributed, apparently as a joke, by an officerconducting a training program May 8 in Caroline County, Legum said.   ``If this test is an indication of his feelings for females,then what is it for blacks? And how does another black female evenstand a chance to get hired?'' Sewell wrote.   Monday a formal complaint was filed against Sewell for mailingthe material to Brown.   In a statement Wednesday, Brown said the agency launched aninvestigation the day the quiz was distributed because it was``totally inappropriate'' and offensive. Brown said ``appropriateactions'' were being taken against those involved, declining to bespecific because personnel matters are confidential.   Without naming Sewell, Brown said that an officer wrote tosuperiors about the incident and sent copies of the letter with thesex quiz attached to numerous persons outside the agency.   ``This conduct too has been determined to merit appropriateaction,'' Brown said.   Legum said Sewell was that officer and the only complaint so farbrought against him was for mailing the quiz to Brown. Sewell hassaid he did send other copies outside the agency.   Departmental charges carry punishments ranging from verbalreprimand to dismissal.   The one-page quiz featured 24 true-false statements playing offsexual puns, according to a copy provided to The (Annapolis)Capital by Annapolis Alderman Carl O. Snowden.   In his letter to Brown, Sewell compared the jokes to a file ofracist and ethnic jokes found in the DNR police radio room. Thediscovery prompted a lawsuit and $26,000 settlement.   In 1986, the agency agreed to punish the distribution of similarmaterial as part of a settlement to a bias suit brought by thedepartment's black officers.   When the second suit was filed, the DNR's 203-member policeforce had four black officers. The force, which patrols state landsand waterways, now has 14 black officers and 14 women officersamong a staff of 226.</TEXT></DOC>
