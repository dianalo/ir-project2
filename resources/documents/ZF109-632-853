 McGrew of GenText presented a survey of the current stateof the IBM/370 mainframe art.andP;  It was an eye-opener for those in the audienceaccustomed to desktop systems; the gulf between mainframe software anddesktop software is immense, from several points of view.andM;To begin with, WYS/WYG software is not available on mainframes.andP;  The usermust create and edit files using a text terminal.andP;  The files containmonospaced characters and do not show layout or composed line endings.andP;  Thetext is interspersed with commands that either change the format directly(typographic codes) or indicate document structure (generic markup).andM;To see the effect of these commands on the appearance of the document, theuser must run the file through a composition program and then view it on apreview terminal or output it on a laser printer.andM;In short, mainframe publishing in 1990 is still conducted in the way thatmost typesetting was done in the 1970s.andM;Furthermore, the standardization that has swept the desktop arena has yet topenetrate mainframes.andP;  PostScript is only beginning to make itself felt asone of several incompatible output languages for mainframe output devices(which tend to be plain-paper printers, rarely typesetting machines usingphotosensitive media).andP;  The field is dominated by the proprietary printerlanguages of IBM and Xerox, and font incompatibilities in a mixed-vendorenvironment present serious problems.andP;  Similarly, there is no agreement onstandardized image formats (like TIFF and EPSF on the desktop).andP;  Conversionsto and from various graphics formats frequently are not bundled withe thesoftware and must be purchased as separate programs from third-party vendors.andM;Mainframe users are faced with a choice among three main incompatibleoperating-system offerings: VM, MVS and VSE (which used to be called &quot;DOS&quot;).andO;Software, including editing and formatting packages, may be available forone, two or all of these.andM;Typically, VM is the environment of choice for publishing software, and mostpackage become available under VM first if not exclusively.andP;  If a companydoes not have VM, however, it may opt to live with software that works withone of the others; a common reason for doing mainframe publishing is theeconomy of using the existing hardware and software.andP;  Changing operatingsystems can be expensive and traumatic, so it is avoided when economy is theprime objective.andP;  This operating-system issue sometimes makes mainframepublishing impractical at sites running VSE, for which little publishingsoftware is available.andM;The primary publishing software discussed in the session was DCF (DocumentComposition Facility), which has been IBM's main page-composition offeringfor may years.andP;  Recently, a set of long-document functions called BookMasterhas been offered as a DCF add-on.andP;  Also mentioned were Script and XICS.andP;  Toone of these packages, the user must add an editor and other programs such asgraphics and chart-generation packages.andP;  Generally speaking, the choice islimited: the mainframe environment does not enjoy the same rich variety ofpublishing software and utilities as the desktop world.andM;The costs, compared with other approaches, can also be high, unless excesscomputer capacity already exists that can be viewed as &quot;free.&quot;andP;  A minimalsystem, including lease of a small CPU, DCF, Bookmaster and several relatedsoftware items (Overlay Generation Language,a PostScript conversion package,Graphical display Manager, and Interactive Chart Utility), would run about$60,000 a year.andP;  The software does not have a fixed price: mainframe softwareprices vary according to the size and power of the CPU on which it will run.andM;We doubt that the economics of mainframe publishing would be compelling inmost companies.andP;  The real reason for most decisions in favor of mainframepublishing today would, we expect, be based on the need to publish data thatis already maintained on the mainframe.andM;The typical application is some kind of database publishing.andP;  Wholesalers andmanufacturers with extensive product lines often need to maintain informationabout their stock on mainframes,  then print catalogs and price lists thatcontain the same data.andP;  Similarly, insurance companies have databases ofapproved coverage wordings, and these can be combined into coverage booklets,formatted and output.andP;  This application also has a &quot;publish-on-demand&quot;aspect--the process's output is the actual publication, not a master copythat will be reproduced by duplicator or offset press.andP;  The requirement forpublishing on demand from a corporate database is often an incentive forgetting involved with mainframe-based publishing.andM;Readers interested in learning more about mainframe publishing might want toget a copy of In-House Publishing in a Mainframe Environment by P.C.andP;  McGrewand William McDaniel.andP;  The second edition has just been published byMcGraw-Hill.andM;The corporate platformsandM;The corporate platformsandM;The transition to fourth-wave publishing technologies has been a tough row tohoe for most publishing system vendors, but especially for those that havetraditionally served the office automation market.andM;Gone are the days when a Xerox, IBM or DEc could be assured of a captivemarket, willing to ante up millions for complete soup-to-notes corporateinformation management solutions.andP;  Today's corporate publishers have amishmash of hardware and applications, all needing to be integrated with eachother somehow to allow effective and timely data interchange betweendepartments and offices.andP;  And the scope of what was previously considered&quot;publishing&quot; has expanded to include compound documents, consisting of text,graphics, full-motion images, voice messages, live links and hyperlinks, aswell as nonprint distribution media--CD-ROM, online retrieval, multimedia andthe like.andM;Managing the process.andP;  The sheer volume of data that must be stored, managedand exchanged, as well as the growing complexity of the &quot;documents&quot; beingexchanged, has forced the industry to seek better ways to manage thedocumentation process.andP;  Geoff James of DEC defined the scope of the problemin sobering terms:andM;* The government estimates that 50% of all military accidents result frominaccurate technical information.andM;* Airlines can be fined up to $10,000 per takeoff because of out-of-datemaintenance information.andM;* Pharmaceutical companies can lose their entire Randamp;D investments if they areunable to provide timely new drug documentation.andM;James went on to characterize document management as the coordination of theentire documentation process, including storage, searching, retrieving,routing, linking, tacking and distributing documents to all appropriateapplications and users anywhere on the corporate network.andP;  Documentmanagement also addresses the problem of the timeliness and accuracy ofdocument information--an increasing concern in fast-paced industries whereprinted documentation is frequently out of date by the time it reaches thefield.andM;As major players in the office automation market, DEC, IBM and Xerox havemore than a passing interest in forging an effective &quot;enterprise-wide&quot;document management strategy for their customers.andP;  Exacerbating this task isthe reality that these companies can no longer assume that their customershave homogenous computing environments.andP;  Support for industry standards andheterogenous platforms is mandatory these days.andM;We cover from time to time the publishing strategies of companies that serveboth the office and publishing market.andP;  Here's a current summary of wherethey stand.andM;DEC.andP;  Digital's Compound Document Architecture was discussed in our lastissue; it forms the heart of Digital's effort to support &quot;enterprise-wide&quot;publishing and document management.andP;  Its architecture is the only one of anyplatform vendor that really supports multiple operating systems, and it isthe only one that addresses the complexity of compound document interchangeamong heterogenous computers.andM;Digital has focused on laying a strong foundation; the toolkits and theoperating systems are in place.andP;  Now it is developing the second floor ofsystem software (&quot;middleware&quot;), which include resources such as search andretrieval as network resources--available to any user on any machine on thenetwork.andP;  Although independent developers are key to Digital's success, DECis also working on &quot;the upper floors&quot; of applications that demonstrate theviability of its architecture.andM;DEC's approach to publishing, which includes an architecture that reachesacross platforms, stands in contrast to Sun's, which focuses primarily onproviding hardware and system software for one box.andP;  DEC is also the firstvendor to actively develop document management tools that interface to avariety of applications running on a variety of computers.andM;IBM.andP;  IBM has so many publishing strategies that it is difficult toencapsulate what the company is doing, except to say that it is pursuing alldirections at once.andP;  On the mainframe side, IBM is now offering to itscustomers the electronic book facility it developed for internal use.andP;  (SeeVol.andP;  20, No.andP;  4 of the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems for a discussionof BookManager.)andP;  It will be offering Adobe fonts on all of its platforms,from PS/2s to mainframes.andP;  It is developing a document management systemsdesigned by the publishing group.andP;  On the Unix front, it developed electronicmanuals (delivered on CD-ROM) for the RS/6000 with the help of Interleaf, butthere is no corresponding document management product.andM;In general, IBM's effort to develop an overall architecture for publishinghas been bogged down by the multiplicity of its platforms and the competinginterests of its various application groups.andP;  It is trying to pull togetherthe system issues of its SAA strategy, its user interfaces (of which it haslicensed several), its printer data stream and its compound documentarchitecture all in one fell swoop.andP;  As near as we can tell, IBM is at leastsix months away from being able to discuss coherently how all of these piecesblend into one cohesive strategy.andM;Xerox.andP;  In the publishing business, Xerox is a system integrator, a supplierof turnkey systems and a supplier of output devices.andP;  By acquisition, it hasentered the microsoftware business.andP;  Its strategy is to continue to build onits strengths in these areas, but to shift its attention from hardware toapplication software for its key publishing product: the ViewPoint editor.andO;The porting of this editor to the Sparcstation, and the introduction ofseveral innovative applications to go with it, signal Xerox's first step inthis direction.andM;Like Sun, HP and almost everyone else except DEC, Xerox has no architecturefor integrating its publishing systems with those of other vendors.andP;  Itsnetwork and printers support third-party products, and the new DocuBuildstructured editor is easily integrated with other systems.andP;  But seamlessintegration of compound documents comes through an all-Xerox approach.andP;  As aresult, its approach to document management is very self-centered; its newDocuTeam is an exciting new product for managing projects and data, but itonly recognizes ViewPoint documents.andM;HP.andP;  Hewlett-Packard, like IBM, is slowly working on a compound documentarchitecture, and in the meantime it is making use of third-party products.andO;Its architecture is the NewWave environment, which operates with Windows nowand will be available for OS/2 and Unix.andP;  NewWave establishes many of thecomputing conventions for developers, but it lacks an underlying compounddocument data model.andP;  At this point, Hewlett-Packard has not declared itsintentions in this area.andP;  Like Sun, HP (with Apollo) is approachingmass-market volumes with its Unix hardware, and it is the corporate vendorother than IBM to sell a high volume of PCS.andM;Its path has been to follow Microsoft in Presentation Manager and then, withMotif, to offer a similar graphical user interface for Unix.andP;  It is anapproach with considerable appeal for those who straddle the PC/Unix market.andM;Others.andP;  Wang, Data General, NCR, Unisys, ATandamp;T--quite a few large computercompanies serve the office automation market and, as a result, providepublishing capabilities for their customers.andP;  Of these, only Wang has begunto develop a compound document architecture, and it is far inferior to DEC's.andO;Every office automation vendor is now or soon will be in the Unix market, sopublishing and document management software for other Unix platforms mayspill over into these vendors' boxes.andP;  But as a group, these firms do not seepublishing as a critical application.andP;  Wang and Data General have flirtedwith the publishing market, and other firms have offered publishing productsas needed.andP;  But none of these players is likely to offer an environment thatis better than, or even significantly different from, those of the marketleaders.andM;The niche environmentsandM;In addition to those mentioned above, there was news at the Conference fromone other platform vendor of keen interest to publishers.andP;  At this point,Silicon Graphics is not shipping in mass-market volumes.andP;  But it made movesin that direction at the Conference.andM;SGI for color.andP;  Silicon Graphics is quickly establishing its Irisworkstations as the premier platform for graphic arts color applications,particularly retouching.andP;  The appeal is not SGI's operating system (Unix) somuch as its box and graphics software, which are designed forhigh-performance color.andP;  Barco, Full Color Computing, Gems and XyvisionDesign are examples of color vendors that have chosen this platform.andP;  Theirproducts are covered in the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems.andO;Nevertheless, we included SGI's announcements in this report (below in thissection) because they relate to how the firm is making its computingenvironment attractive to developers.andM;The users tell their talesandM;Back to the future.andP;  The client-server model of distributed computing isnothing new, of course.andP;  Even in the bad old days, we had file servers, printservers, application servers and even modem servers.andP;  They were called&quot;minicomputers.&quot;andP;  They had lots of advantages: files got backed upreligiously, hardware configuration and repair was seen to by gurus and userscould take these central services for granted.andP;  There were alsodisadvantages: the mini could get bogged down when too many users were loggedin, and when it failed, everything stopped cold.andP;  Worst of all, softwaredevelopment was in the hands of the MIS nerds, who spoke a strange languageand worked odd hours, and whose priorities were not your priorities.andM;Modern client-server systems have a lot in common with the mini.andP;  The usercan take network services for granted to some extent, though access to theserver can get bogged down by too much network traffic.andP;  Some things havegotten better: even if the net fails, you can still get some work done onyour PC.andP;  Some things have gotten worse: backups are often a chancy thing.andO;You still need a guru to configure and administer the network, and even if hedoesn't work in the MIS department, his priorities might not be yourpriorities.andM;In other words, before networked microcomputers will have any real advantagesover the old-fashioned minicomputer, a few problems have to get solved.andM;The problems.andP;  Jamie Lewis, an analyst with Clarke Burton Corp., sketched themajor roadblocks.andP;  First and foremost is the &quot;plumbing mess.&quot;andP;  The goal ofheterogeneous systems (which users clearly want) means that multiple types ofclient workstations and servers that run on different platforms must sharethe same network cabling and data transfer protocols.andP;  But Novell is weddedto its IPX/SPX and TLI protocols; Microsoft relies on NetBEUI and namedpipes; the Unix world has adopted TCP/IP and sockets; and Apple never doeswhat anybody else does.andM;Developers of workgroup applications can choose among these and othernetworking schemes, thereby becoming locked into whatever their operatingsystem vendor decides to offer and locked out of some portion of thepotential market.andP;  Alternatively, developers can try to keep theirapplications independent of any particular networking protocol, which meansthey must embed a virtual operating system in their applications, lengtheningdevelopment times and raising costs without increasing the customer'sperceived benefit.andP;  (This is the approach taken by most Novell-basedcommercial publishing systems: Magna, Ultimate, Bestinfo, etc.)andM;There are other problems: user authentication and network security (includingchannel encryption, logs and audit trails), system-wide directories andnaming services.andP;  We are just beginning to see some progress on these issues.andO;The CCITT X.400 and X.500 proposed standards will cover data interfaces anddirectory services, respectively.andP;  Operating system vendors are no longerquite so proprietary about their data transport protocols; cross-licensingwill soon be common, and systems are already being designed to supportmultiple protocol stacks simultaneously.andM;A success story.andP;  Gilbert andamp; Associates is a system integrator in Seattle thathas successfully automated a client's law practice using networked PCs andoff-the-shelf software.andP;  As Phil Gilbert explained it, the main softwarecomponents are:andM;* Saros Mezzanine, a client-server application for network-wide file storage,access and management;andM;* Polaris PackRat, a personal information manager; andandM;* Microsoft Word.andM;These packages are linked via Windows DDE and rely heavily on an SQL databaseserver for finding the needed information.andM;According to Gilbert, very little actual programming was needed to create asurprisingly snazzy system.andP;  His firm wrote one piece of code in atraditional programming language; all the rest of the customization was donewith the macros and scripting tools provided in the applications.andM;A publisher's goals.andP;  Tim Gill, the moving force behind Quark Xpress, thenpointed out that publishing applications often have to be quite complex,simply because there are many ways of organizing a publication.andM;* An editorial-driven process is typical of newspapers, technical manuals andscholarly journals.andM;* A layout-driven process is widely used for magazines, brochures, annualreports and the like.andM;* Less formal publications are likely to be &quot;Shirley-driven,&quot; in that someonenamed Shirley is the only one who really knows what is going on.andM;* Nearly everyone has been part of a panic-driven process where no one reallyknows what is going on.andM;In addition, publishers need to use a wide range of tools, including wordprocessors, databases, spreadsheets, illustration and graphics packages,clip-art libraries, page assembly programs, job tracking and file archivingutilities, and electronic mail.andP;  There are some pretty good products in manyof these categories, but few of them are designed to integrate with theothers.andP;  All have some shortcomings: E-mail has no concept of process flows,while word processing and graphics packages have no project status indicatorsand cannot tell you the depth the story will be on the page.andP;  There arebetter file archiving tools for the PC than the Mac, and nobody does a goodjob of providing job tracking information.andM;It is clear that no one application developer can provide all of thefunctionality that publishers need.andP;  Quark has begun to develop one part ofthe solution by putting a network-aware communication function into Xpress3.0.andP;  While Xpress currently doesn't do much with it (except a mild form ofcopy protection), the function could be used by Xtensions that Quark andoutside programmers might develop in the future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
