Wright, according to a report by the ethics panel's generalcounsel, put a ``hold'' on a bill in late 1986 to provideregulators $15 billion through special fees on the industry toclose the most critically insolvent savings and loan institutions,many of them in Texas.   During the same period, Wright was meeting with officials of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the thrift industry,on behalf of four Texas businessmen _ two of them Democratic Partyfund-raisers _ deeply embroiled in the Sandamp;L crisis.   Despite split votes by the ethics committee clearing Wright ofspecific violations of House rules in those meetings, specialcounsel Richard Phelan concluded Wright exercised ``undueinfluence'' in two of the cases and in trying to get two of theBank Board's toughest regulators fired.   And several Bank Board officials told the committee of instancesin which they felt compelled to bow to Wright's demands in order toprevent collapse of the Sandamp;L insurance fund that guaranteesdepositors against losses up to $100,000.   At the time, the Bank Board's Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp. (FSLIC) subsidiary had only a $3 billion _ a fraction of whatit would need _ to rescue of depositors in 130 ``severelytroubled'' Sandamp;Ls.   A combination of plummeting real estate values from the collapseof the Oil Belt economy plus Ponzi schemes by ``high flyer'' realestate developers who jumped into the Sandamp;L business, particularly inTexas with its loose banking regulations, had made many of theiroutstanding loans worthless.   As the crisis developed, the Reagan administration in May 1986asked Congress to recapitalize the Sandamp;L insurance fund with $15billion to be financed through special assessments on memberinstitutions.   The bill was put on the House calendar for action on Sept. 29.But two weeks earlier _ on Sept. 15 _ Wright, then the HouseMajority Leader, called the Bank Board's then-chairman, Edwin Gray,to his office to complain about ``heavy-handed'' and``Gestapo-like'' tactics of Bank Board regional officials in Dallas.   On Sept. 2, Wright had met in his Fort Worth office with CraigHall, a Dallas-based real estate syndicator and one of the largestowners of real estate in Texas. Hall complained to Wright that theBank Board was too inflexible, according to the Ethics Committee'sreport.   Hall said he could not keep current with hundreds of millions indollars in loans with more than 20 Sandamp;Ls because of the worseningTexas economy. He had arranged ``global'' repackaging deal with allbut one of them, Westwood Savings and Loan of Los Angeles, whichheld approximately $200 million of his loans.   Because of its already severe loan losses, Westwood was underthe control of a Bank Board representative. The Bank Board officialhad concluded it would be less expensive for the federal insurancefund to foreclose on Hall's property and let him go bankrupt ratherthan accept the restructuring package.   Shortly after the Sept. 2 meeting, Wright called Gray tocomplain about the Bank Board representative running Westwood andasked him ``if there was not anything he could do about this,''according to Gray.   On Sept. 26, a Friday, Hall, Gray and other Bank Board officialslearned that Wright had put a hold on the $15 billion Sandamp;L insurancefund recapitalization scheduled for House action the followingMonday.   Three days later, Gray replaced the Bank Board's representativeat Westwood. The bill was put back on the House calendar for Oct. 6and passed the next day.   But for Wright's request, Gray told the ethics committee, ``Iwould have taken some other corrective action, such as, `You'regoing to have to be more communicative, listen better, be moreprepared.'''   Gray said Wright made no specific threats nor used any coerciveterms. At the same time, Gray said he was convinced he was beingasked to remove the Bank Board official overseeing Westwood.   ``Anybody who has worked in the government for very long knowsthat when the Speaker _ soon to be the Speaker of the House ofRepresentatives _ is asking you to look into it, it's not justanybody.''   Shannon Fairbanks, then the Bank Board's chief of staff, toldthe ethics committee that Gray and other agency officials felt theywere under extreme pressure to bow to that request and severalothers by Wright before the bill, in a different version, wassigned into law 11 months later.   ``Ed (Gray) believed that he was being posed a choice,'' shesaid. ``And that choice was: Craig Hall has a significant problemwith your system; you say your system needs money, but I am notgoing to be prepared to give that system money unless I seeevidence that your system is capable of responding; and thatevidence can be provided by being responsive to Craig Hall.''   As a result, she said, the Bank Board felt compelled tocompromise its regulatory standards in order to obtain the funds itneeded.   ``Throughout that whole period, we tormented, and we didn't likewhat we did,'' she told the ethics committee. ``I had spent a lotof years growing up talking theoretically about means and ends, andthe end here was the ability to start to close down theseinstitutions with adequate money. But the means was a perversion ofthe system.''   Phelan, the ethics committee's counsel, said neither Wright norhis staff ever looked at the merits of the Bank Board's regulatoryactivities or gave any consideration to the legal bases for itsactions.   Phelan likened Wright's actions to ``blackmail'' and said he``called for reconsideration regardless of the legal justification.Blocking of the recapitalization bill after his call regarding Hallconstituted a prohibited suggestion of reprisal.''   In August 1987, the Bank Board finally received a $10.8 billionrecapitalization package, but only after President Reagan hadthreatened to veto any amount less.   During the interim, it had been cut to $5 billion at one pointthrough the efforts of House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho ofCalifornia and the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the Sandamp;Lindustry's biggest lobbying arm and a large source of politicalcampaign funds.   Of the $38 billion that the government committed in 1988 toclosing down or merging insolvent Sandamp;Ls, $25 billion involvedinstitutions in Texas or defaults on loans from thrifts in otherstates for Texas real estate ventures.   Last week, the Senate approved an Sandamp;L bailout bill with aminimum estimated costs of $126 billion _ two-thirds of if fromtaxpayers _ over the next 10 years.   ``We would not be here today talking about a $126 billionproblem if we had passed the $15 billion in FSLIC recapitalizationin October of 1986,'' Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah and former chairman ofthe Senate Banking Committee, said in opening the debate lastMonday.   ``I'm not going to insult anybody's intelligence by saying that$15 billion would have solved the problem, but it's safe to say theproblem would be at least half what it is today,'' Garn said. ``Itwould have provided funds to close down a lot of those brain-deadinstitutions before they continued to make bad loans.''</TEXT></DOC>
