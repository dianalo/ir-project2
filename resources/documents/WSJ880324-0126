Yesterday, Israeli fighter-bombers again raided the bases in Lebanon of Arab fighting groups, including the terrorism-oriented Abu Nidal and the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. A two-hour chain of secondary explosions signaled that a large store of ammunition had been hit. It was another brief battle in the 40-year Arab-Israeli war.    We hear kind-spirited people urging the Israelis to trade &quot;land for peace.&quot; Such urgings became stronger during the West Bank uprisings that have left some 103 Arabs and one Israeli soldier dead. India yesterday canceled a planned visit to Israel of its Davis Cup tennis team to protest Israel's handling of the riots, even though they are not unlike some that India itself has suffered in recent years.    Mr. Shamir has no intention of bending to such pressures. Before his departure Monday and after discussions with President Reagan, Secretary of State Shultz and Jewish and non-Jewish groups, he said Israel would simply have to put down the riots as best it can. If that sounds like obstinacy, perhaps it's time once more to examine carefully the forces that have kept the Arab-Israeli conflict boiling so long. There are no easy solutions.    The concept of &quot;land for peace&quot; originated with the famous Resolution 242 adopted by the United Nations Security Council on Nov. 22, 1967. That was six months after the Six-Day War. Closure of the Strait of Tiran to Israeli shipping and the movement of 80,000 troops into the Sinai by Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser had touched off the war. After Israel had rolled back the combined forces of Egypt, Jordan and Syria it possessed a lot of the territory formerly held by those countries. So the Security Council wanted Israel to return the land in exchange for peace assurances. Israeli soldiers, fresh from battle, thought that sounded pretty funny. They recalled that there were U.N. &quot;peacekeepers&quot; in the Sinai in 1967, too, until Nasser expelled them.    With the Camp David agreement of 1978, Israel did return the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for a peace treaty. That this agreement has worked reasonably well, with the help of a great deal of U.S. financial aid to both sides, is cited as precedent by &quot;land for peace&quot; advocates. Camp David also set in motion a process for negotiating the future of Palestinians on the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan river, as well as Palestinian refugees in that narrow Mediterranean enclave called the Gaza Strip. But the problems here are very different from those faced by Begin, Sadat and Jimmy Carter.    King Hussein, who himself warred with the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1970, is not eager to assume jurisdiction over West Bank Palestinians. The PLO, with origins in postwar Soviet efforts to promote &quot;Arab socialism,&quot; has not demonstrated a great interest in peace. Quite the contrary, the fine hand of the PLO has been behind assassinations of moderate West Bank leaders who would have been a vital element in carrying out the Camp David goals of providing self-rule to West Bank Palestinians. Finally, there are some lands that Israel simply will not yield. It will not return the Golan Heights to Syria and once again put its northern settlements under Syrian guns. And it will not restore the pre-1967 partition of Jerusalem.    Yet the U.S. State Department concluded that what was needed to reconcile matters was an international conference. The U.S. and the Soviet Union, among others, would benignly midwife the delivery of Israeli-occupied territories into Arab hands. The direct talks would be conducted between Israel and Jordan, with Palestinian representation on the Jordanian side.    Mr. Shamir came, heard all the arguments, and said no. What is there about an international conference that would make it easier to solve the problems described above? Given the fact that the Soviets have supported a number of attacks on Israel and have no official relations, should Soviet participation be welcomed? What would a Yasser Arafat peace guarantee be worth? Or one from Abu Nidal? Or, for that matter, U.N. assurances?    Israel, in short, will continue to seek its own solutions, negotiating certainly with King Hussein if and when he is willing. But there is no easy solution, contrary to the hopes of all those who think it can be found in &quot;land for peace.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
