Mr. Rock's forecast fallsinto the midrange of estimates for 1992 and would be about 7%below the 860 average he expects for 1991. Last year'saverage was 1,010.</LP><TEXT>   That's not as bad as in 1942, when an average of 761 rigspoked holes in the U.S. in Baker Hughes Inc.'s first ever andlowest ever count. Drilling activity cranked up the next yearbecause &quot;the war effort discovered it needed oil,&quot; says IkeKerridge, an economist with Baker Hughes of Houston.   But in a sense, companies that depend on U.S. drillingactivity have been going downhill since the rig count peakedat 4,530 in December 1981. A much smaller and leaner industrythought it had hit bottom along with oil prices in 1986, butthe few mild recoveries since have been shortlived. At thispoint, both the service companies and oil and natural gasproducers themselves have basically given up their refrainthat good times are just around the corner.   &quot;After nine years I'm running out of patience,&quot; C.R.Palmer, chairman of Rowan Cos. of Houston, told moneymanagers late last month at the Lehman Brothers oil serviceconference in New York. Mr. Palmer believes, &quot;We have severalmore years of gutting it out in the trenches.&quot;   With the drop in rigs has come a drop in what customerspay for service. Day rates for a Gulf of Mexico drilling righave plunged to $9,000 from $24,000 last year. Internationalactivity has been steadier, but unused domestic equipment ischasing overseas business and driving prices down in manyforeign markets, too. North Sea rig rates have fallen to$35,000 a day from $60,000, for instance. And, Kuwait neverturned into the bonanza many were expecting.   Certainly not everyone is dour. David Herasimchuck, vicepresident of market development for Global Marine Inc.,Houston, believes the current downturn is an interruption ofan upward trend that will resume in months because of vastnew international opportunities, from the Soviet Union toWest Africa to Southeast Asia. &quot;The world is open to us likeit never has been before,&quot; he says.   But most industry executives are gloomy. So are investors.While the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index has risen 15%since the beginning of the year, the 17 oil-service stocksmeasured by Lehman Brothers have fallen about 10% as of thelatest week.   Bottom-fishing spurred some investors yesterday to try tosnap up some oil service stocks that they perceive asbargains, which pushed prices higher. The rally, however,wasn't enough to change the fundamental outlook that oildrilling activity will continue to be weak, as it has beenthis year.   Behind the drop was the depression in natural gas prices,which drained explorers big and small of optimism and cashflow. &quot;We're not expecting to make any money next yearbecause of weak natural gas prices,&quot; says Jim Gibbs,president of tiny Wainoco Oil Corp. of Houston. Prices thepast summer fell below $1 per thousand cubic feet, more than25% below last year's already weak levels. &quot;That {weakprices} will be the rule for three years,&quot; Mr. Gibbs says.   Cash-flow constraints have even forced big oil companiesto underspend their exploration budgets. Some servicecompanies have complained of payment delays. In addition,many major oil companies, including Atlantic Richfield Co.,Shell Oil Co., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Oryx Energy Co.,have been trying to sell properties or have laid offemployees.   Lower down the food chain, the oil-service industry hassuffered. &quot;I really am tired of waiting on my customers,&quot;says Robert Howson, chairman of McDermott International Inc.,New Orleans. What's frustrating to many executives is thatmany companies fought their way back to at least break-evenlevels after 1986 as weak competitors died and cost-cuttingwas prevalent.   Daniel Industries Inc., which makes valves and meters,employs 1,600 people, about half the 1986 level. But itsrevenue will be greater this year than a decade ago, saysWilliam Griffin III, president of the Houston company. Bothbecause of marketing efforts and because it doesn't have muchchoice, a larger share -- now 50% -- of Daniel's businesscomes from outside the U.S.   Industry conditions have forced cutbacks too. For example:   -- McDermott International plans to sell 21 marineconstruction vessels and along with other measures wants toreduce expenses by $40 million in its current fiscal year andby an additional $50 million in the next year.   -- Dresser Industries Inc. of Dallas has quietly laid offmore than 10% of its U.S. oil field staff, and cuts &quot;will godeeper this year,&quot; Chairman John Murphy says.   -- Halliburton Co., also in Dallas, has already laid off1,200 people this year, it may close some field servicelocations and expects cost savings of $40 million in thesecond half.   -- Chiles Offshore Corp. of Houston is selling itsIntrepid drilling rig for $28.5 million to Brazil's nationaloil company and plans to sell three smaller rigs for a totalof $14 million to Venezuela's national oil company.   The industry isn't giving up on the U.S. but it pins itshopes on growth overseas. Dresser Industries is gearing forincreased drilling in Latin America, Africa and Asia. &quot;Interms of raw potential, the Soviet Union clearly holds thegreatest opportunity for the energy industry of any region inthe world,&quot; says Mr. Murphy, Dresser's chairman.   Just back from a trip to Russia, Mr. Murphy says he raninto representatives from every major oil company. &quot;You can'tget a hotel room in Moscow because of all the oil companies,&quot;he says.</TEXT></DOC>
