L. 97-293 (96 Stat. 1263), was signed into lawby President Reagan on October 12, 1982. The Act modernized Reclamationlaw. Final rules and regulations implementing the RRA were published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 6, 1983. Those rules were revisedon April 13, 1987, primarily to add provisions for implementing section203(b) of the Act. That section mandated that after April 12, 1987, partiesremaining subject to prior law must pay the full-cost rate for irrigationwater delivered to land leased in a landholding in excess of 160 acres.On October 26, 1987, the rules were again revised. The purpose of thisrevision was to eliminate ``gifted land'' as a type of land transactionsubject to the involuntary acquisition provisions of the rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Revisions</ITAG>The Bureau is now proposing to revise the rules to incorporate provisionsimplementing the new RRA amendments contained in the 1987 Budget Act.Audits_The first amendment, section 224(g) mandates the Secretary of theInterior to conduct a thorough audit of compliance with Reclamation lawby individuals and legal entities. The amendment requires the Secretary,at a minimum, to complete audits of landholdings and operations exceeding960 acres within 3 years. During each of these 3 years, the Secretary isalso required to submit a report to Congress summarizing audit findingsand actions that have been taken to correct instances of noncompliance.The Bureau has initiated its audit efforts. However, since this amendmentplaces no new requirements on landholders themselves, the Bureau proposesnot to add any additional audit language to the rules. The existing provision,andSection; 426.10(i), addresses audits and provides landholders with sufficientinformation regarding this topic. However, in order to ensure that theSecretary has the information necessary to perform the required audits,the Bureau proposes to revise the language in andSection; 426.10(a) to clarifythat districts, prior law and new law recipients, and persons operatingirrigation land under management arrangements or consulting agreementsmust provide information and records upon request by the Secretary.Extended recordable contracts_The second amendment, section 224(h), clarifiesthat the provisions of section 205(c) of the RRA are applicable to allrecordable contracts entered into prior to October 12, 1982. Basically,section 205(c) requires that the full-cost rate must be paid for waterdeliveries to land held under an extended recordable contract. Prior tothe amendment, this provision applied only to landholders subject to thediscretionary provisions (sections 203 through 208) of the RRA. Prior lawrecipients were permitted to receive irrigation water at the contract ratefor the entire length of the extended recordable contract.These rules propose to revise andSection; 426.11(i)(4) of the rules so thatboth prior law recipients and recipients subject to the discretionary provisionsare required to pay the full-cost rate for land under extended recordablecontract. In accordance with the 1987 amendment, the rules provide thatthe full-cost rate for prior law recipients became effective on December23, 1987, and is not retroactive to water delivered prior to that date.Currently, the rules provide that the interest rate in determining theappropriate full-cost water rate for deliveries to land under an extendedrecordable contract is in section 202(3) of the RRA and in andSection; 426.7(f)(1)of the current rules. The Department of the Interior (Department) has determinedthat this interest rate would also apply to prior law recipients who comeunder the provisions of section 205(c) by virtue of section 224(h). Therefore,the Bureau proposes to revise andSection; 426.7(f) of the rules to reflectthe fact that the full-cost interest rates applying to a prior law recipientwith leased land is different from the interest rate applying to land heldby a prior law recipient under extended recordable contract.Underpayments_We propose to add a new section to the rules to incorporatethe third RRA amendment, section 224(i). This amendment provides that whenthe Secretary finds that any individual or legal entity has not paid therequired amount for irrigation water delivered to a landholding, he shallcollect the amount of any underpayment with interest accruing from theday the required payment was due until paid. This requirement of law isreflected in andSection; 426.23 of the proposed rules. The ``Severability''provision, which is designated as section 426.23 in the existing rules,has been redesignated as section 426.24 in the proposed rule.Revocable trusts_The last of the RRA amendments revises the trust sectionof the RRA, section 214, by adding a subsection providing that land ina revocable trust will be attributed to the grantor if (1) the trust isrevocable at the discretion of the grantor or the trust revokes or terminatesby its terms once a specific time period has expired and (2) revocationor termination results in title to the land reverting either directly orindirectly to the grantor. The Bureau proposes to revise andSection;andSection;426.6(b)(4) and (d)(6) of the current rules to incorporate this amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that the proposed rules donot constitute a major rule under Executive Order 12291; therefore, a RegulatoryImpact Analysis is not required and has not been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>A draft FONSI (finding of no significant impact) and a draft supplementto the April 1987 environmental assessment, which address the environmentalimpacts of the proposed rules, have been prepared and are available forpublic review. Copies of these documents may be obtained upon request fromthe Bureau offices located in Boise, Idaho; Sacramento, California; BoulderCity, Nevada; Salt Lake City, Utah; Billings, Montana; and Washington,DC. Comments on the FONSI and the supplement to the 1987 environmentalassessment may be incorporated with comments on the proposed rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget as is required by 44 U.S.C.3501 et seq. and assigned clearance numbers 1006-0005 and 1006-0006.<ITAG tagnum="84">Small Entity Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The proposed rules will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities. Only a small number of landholders farming landirrigated by Reclamation projects westwide will be affected by any provisionof section 5302 of the 1987 Budget Act. Two of these provisions, the auditand underpayment provisions, are expected to result in little or no economiceffect on landholders. The other two provisions, which address revocabletrusts and extended recordable contracts, may impact a small number oflandholders. However, such landholders will be able to mitigate the potentialimpacts by altering their trust agreements or, in the case of extendedrecordable contracts, by becoming subject to the discretionary provisionsor selling the recordable contract land before the extended contract periodactually matures.<ITAG tagnum="84">Hearings</ITAG>Three public hearings will be held to receive oral testimony on the proposedrules. All hearings will begin at 10 a.m. and will continue until all testimonyhas been heard. Oral statements will be limited to 10 minutes. Speakerswill not be permitted to trade their time to obtain a longer oral presentation;however, the hearings officer may allow any person additional time afterall other comments have been heard. Any scheduled speaker not present whencalled will lose his or her privilege in the scheduled order, but willbe recalled after all the scheduled speakers have been heard. Speaker requestswill be scheduled up to 2 working days preceding the hearings and any subsequentrequests will be handled on a first-come-first-served basis following thescheduled presentations.Hearings will be held on the dates and at the locations shown below.

Section 426.6 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(4) and (d)(6) toread as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 426.6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Ownership entitlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(b) * * *(4) Trusts.(i) An individual or corporate trustee holding land in a fiduciary capacityis not subject to the ownership or pricing limitations imposed by titleII nor the ownership provisions of prior law for land held in this capacity;provided, the trust agreement: is in writing and is approved by the Secretary,identifies the beneficiaries, describes the interests of the beneficiariesand in the case of revocable trusts, the trust agreement also identifiesthe grantor(s) of all lands held in the trust, identifies the person(s)or entity (entities) who may revoke the trust and to whom title to thelands held in the trust will be conveyed upon the revocation of the trust.The Secretary shall be notified of any changes in the above conditions.(ii) In the case of irrevocable trusts and revocable trusts other thanthose described in (b)(4)(iii) of this section, the lands held in the trustwill be attributed to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the trust accordingto the interest held in the trust by each beneficiary. The eligible acreageattributable to to each beneficiary in trust land in combination with otherland directly or indirectly owned by such beneficiary shall not exceedthat beneficiary's ownership entitlement unless the land is either underrecordable contract or was acquired and is eligible under the involuntaryacquisition process provided in andSection; 426.16.(iii) In the case of revocable trusts which may be revoked at the discretionof the grantor(s) of the lands held in the trust and such revocation resultsin title to the trust lands reverting to the grantor(s) either directlyor indirectly, or if the terms of the trust require that it be revokedor terminated upon the expiration of a specified period of time and suchrevocation or termination results in the title to the lands held in thetrust reverting either directly or indirectly to the grantor(s), the landsheld in that trust will be attributed to the grantor(s) of the lands. Therefore,in the case of such revocable trusts, the eligible acreage attributableto each grantor in trust land in combination with other land directly orindirectly owned by such grantor shall not exceed that grantor's ownershipentitlement unless the land is either under recordable contract or wasacquired and is eligible under the involuntary acquisition process providedin andSection; 426.16. However, a revocable trust in which a grantor retainsthe power to change the beneficiaries or to modify the terms of the trust,but does not provide that the title to trust property will revert to thegrantor upon revocation or termination shall not result in an attributionto the grantor of the trust property. (iv) If the attribution of trust property described in (b)(4)(iii) of thesection results in the grantor of such property becoming subject to thepayment of full cost for irrigation water delivered to lands within hislandholding, such full cost will not apply to the grantor if the trustagreement was revised before April 20, 1988, to avoid or preclude the attributionof the trust property to the grantor. If such a trust agreement was notso revised by that date, the grantor must pay full cost for irrigationwater delivered to that portion of the grantor's landholding that exceedsthe non-full-cost entitlement, commencing December 23, 1987, until suchtrust agreement is so revised. (A) The application of this rule may be illustrated by the following:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>Bank X is the trustee for five irrevocable trusts,each of which has more than one beneficiary. The irrevocable trusts contain1,280, 960, 640, 800, and 400 acres, respectively. The land in the irrevocabletrusts is in districts which have amended their contracts to conform tothe discretionary provisions of title II. Since the ownership and pricinglimitations of title II do not apply to Bank X as trustee for the trustsand all beneficiaries who are qualified recipients are within their respectiveownership entitlements, all 4,080 acres in the five irrevocable trustsare eligible to receive irrigation water at the contract rate. However,if a beneficiary owned directly or indirectly other irrigation land which,when combined with his beneficial interest in the subject irrevocable trusts,caused him to exceed the 960-acre ownership limitation, either that beneficiaryor the trustee would be required to designate the nonexcess land for whichirrigation water could be supplied, depending upon whether the land tobe so designated is directly held by the beneficiary or the trust. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>Farmer X, a qualified recipient, provides in hiswill for the establishment of a trust and the conveyance of 640 acres ofhis land receiving irrigation water into that trust for his minor childupon his death. Farmer X designates his brother as trustee of that testamentary(irrevocable) trust. The land is located in a district which has amendedits cotract to come under the discretionary provisions of title II. Thebrother, who is designated as trustee for the trust, owns 800 acres inthe same district which receives an irrigation water supply. Farmer X dies,and the testamentary trust he has established is activated. The brother,as trustee, is entitled to receive irrigation water for the land in trustas well as the land he owns. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note. </T4>The land placed in the testamentary trust by Farmer X iscounted against his ownership entitlement during his lifetime as long asthe land remained in his ownership. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Farmer X, a qualified recipient, owns 960 acres eligibleto receive irrigation water in a district subject to the provisions oftitle II. He decides to place 160 acres of his land in an irrevocable trustwith his daughter as the life tenant. The 160 acres of trust land shallbe attributed to the daughter's entitlement if she is independent. If sheis dependent, the 160 acres of trust land shall be attributed to FarmerX or to the person upon whom she is dependent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3> ABC Corporation, a prior law recipient, establishesa revocable trust and places 160 acres of land receiving irrigation waterin the trust for the benefit of J. Jones. Under the terms of the revocabletrust, the trust will terminate and title to the 160 acres will revertback to ABC Corporation in 10 years. All 160 acres of the land in trustis attributed to the corporation with all stockholders attributed an indirectinterest in proportion to their percent of stock held in the Corporation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>As in Example (4) above, ABC Corporation establishesa trust for the benefit of J. Jones, which is revocable at the discretionof ABC Corporation, the trustor. But Corporation X, a fully independentlegal entity, rather than Corporation ABC, contributes the 160 acres tothe trust. In this example, the 160 acres is attributed to the beneficiaryof the trust, J. Jones, since the criteria for attribution to the grantor(Corporation X) have not been met; namely, the 160 acres will revert in10 years to the trustor (Corporation ABC), not the grantor, and the grantordoes not have the power to revoke the trust. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>Farmer X, a qualified recipient, places 960 acresof land receiving irrigation water in a trust for his son. The trust agreementprovides that the trust shall expire in 20 years, and ownership of thetrust land shall be vested in Corporation Y, of which Farmer X is a partowner with 5 percent interest. Because title to 5 percent of the trustland will revert indirectly to Farmer X upon termination of the trust,48 acres (960 andmultiply; 5 percent) of the trust land is attributed toFarmer X. The remaining 912 acres of trust land is attributable to thebeneficiaries of the trust. If Farmer X's interest in Corporation Y changesduring the term of the trust, the amount of trust land attributed to FarmerX will change accordingly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(d) * * *(6) See andSection; 426.6(b)(4).<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>3.

The interest rate shall be based on the arithmetic averageof (A) the computer average interest payable by the Treasury upon its outstandingmarketable public obligations which are neither due nor callable for redemptionfor 15 years from the date of issuance and (B) the weighted average yieldon all interest-bearing marketable issues sold by the Treasury. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note to Paragraph (f)(2): </T4>Prior law recipients who become subjectto the discretionary provisions after April 12, 1987, will then becomeeligible for the full-cost interest rate specified in paragraph (f)(1)of this section, unless they are limited recipients that did not receiveirrigation water on or before October 1, 1981.</ITAG>4.

The original disposition period of the recordable contract expireson June 27, 1986, which is more than 18 months after the Secretary resumedthe processing of the excess land sale. Therefore, Landowner Y must paythe full-cost rate for water deliveries to that land beginning June 27,1986, for the duration of the extended contract period. The extended contractperiod will expire on May 21, 1993, 9 years after the Secretary resumedthe processing of the excess land sale.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> Landholder Z entered into a recordable contract onJune 27, 1974.

TheSecretary resumed the processing of excess land sales on May 21, 1984.Landholder Z had 7 years remaining on his recordable contract when themoratorium was imposed; therefore, the contract will be extended for 7years from May 21, 1984, or until May 21, 1991. Landholder Z's land islocated in a district that remains subject to prior law, and LandholderZ has not made an irrevocable election to become subject to the discretionaryprovisions. Since Landholder Z is a prior law recipient and the land wasunder extended recordable contract prior to December 23, 1987, water deliveriesto this land prior to December 23, 1987, were properly made at the contractrate. However, for all water deliveries taking place on or after December23, 1987, Landholder Z must pay the full-cost rate, as described in andSection;426.7(f)(1), through the effective termination date of the extended recordablecontract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>6.
