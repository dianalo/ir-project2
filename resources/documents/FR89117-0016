This action repromulgates the Secretary'suniform standards governing the operations of the Councils. It includes:(1) Implementation of parts of Title I of Pub. L. 99-659; (2) supplementaryinstruction on requirements affecting the Councils under other applicablelaw; (3) guidelines for the fishery management process; and (4) guidelinesfor (a) Council Statements of Organization, Practices, and Procedures,(b) Council organization, (c) employment practices, (d) financial managementsystems, and (e) recordkeeping. Included are some of the changes to thefishery management process approved by the Under Secretary for Oceans andAtmosphere, NOAA, that had been recommended by the two fishery managementstudies commissioned by NOAA in 1985 and 1986: The NOAA/Council Task GroupReport, and the NOAA Fishery Management Study. These two studies, eachof which generated wide public comment, were undertaken to assess the MagnusonAct fishery mangement system after ten years of operation, with a viewto making administrative and legislative improvements. Other 1986 efforts to examine the Magnuson Act system, including the MackerelInvestigative Committee, the Mid-Atlantic Council proposal, and the Centerfor Ocean Management Systems Conference on Rethinking Fishery Management,have figured in the development of these regulations and guidelines. Someof the ideas are derived from procedures successfully implemented by theCouncils over the years. Selected material from the <T3>Magnuson Act Operations Handbook </T3>and from the <T3>Operational Guidelines for the Fishery Management Process </T3>hasbeen updated and included. Three new parts and one subpart have been added: (1) ``Part 600_Definitions'' is designed ultimately to consolidate in oneplace the definitions, word usages, and abbreviations that apply to Chapter6 of Title 50 of the CFR. For purposes of this revision, only those definitionsbroadly connected with Parts 601-605 are included; definitions and wordusages uniquely associated with particular topics remain in their appropriatesections. (2) ``Part 601, Subpart D_Membership'' addresses requirements affectingCouncil members individually, such as appointment, term, removal, conduct,compensation, financial disclosure, and so forth. (3) ``Part 604_Other Applicable Law'' describes the requirements of otherlaw that the Secretary has determined to be applicable to the fishery managementprocess. (4) ``Part 605_Guidelines for Council Operations and Administration'' providesguidance for the development of (a) fishery management plans, and (b) eachCouncil's Statement of Organization, Practices, and Procedures (SOPP).Parts 600 and 601 implement various statutory requirements, and providethe regulatory principles for the 605 guidelines. Part 604 describes tothe public the other laws that the Secretary has determined apply to thefishery management process. The guidelines summarize Secretarial interpretationsthat will be applied under the statutory and regulatory principles. Theyare intended as an aid to decision-making_an indication or outline of futurepolicy or conduct_as for example, to assist in the amendment and reviewof Council SOPPs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Issues and Rationale </ITAG>Revision of these guidelines has been underway since December 1986, andhas included an eight-month-long series of Council and NMFS meetings, drafts,and reviews; three months of intensive joint drafting and further Councilreview; and final debate and recommendations at a Council Chairmen's meetingin July 1988. This process resolved many of the issues before publicationas a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The public comment period thus allowed the Councilsto focus in a more formal way on the need to clarify some remaining administrativequestions. However, two issue areas continued to provoke serious comment:the Council member appointment process, which generated comment from severalGovernors and members of Congress, and the need to distinguish the effectof regulations and guidelines. Many of the suggested changes were primarilyeditorial in nature. In general, NOAA's response was to accept commentsexcept where they (1) contradicted or conflicted with law, Executive Order,or Administration policy; or (2) caused inconsistencies in style, wordusage, or editorial integrity. Many of the changes are refinements andclarifications, and as such are not necessarily addressed individuallyin the body of the comments and response section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Response </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Part 600_Style Guide </ITAG>Section 660.1 Definitions 1. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested a definition of ``confidential''as it is applied to security clearances. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA added the security definition, and, for furtherclarification, distinguished the security definition from the data collectiondefinition as it is applied under the Magnuson Act. 2. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several Councils expressed concern individually and atthe Council Chairmen's meeting about the perceived regulatory effect ofreferencing ``guidelines'' in regulations, and of the descriptions of otherapplicable law in Part 604. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA added a definition of ``guidelines'' with preambleexplanations of how it is applied in the context of Parts 600, 601, 604,and 605. (See ``Background'' section above, and ``comment/response'' atParts 604 and 605.) <ITAG tagnum="81">601 Subpart C_Uniform Standards for Organization, Practices, and Procedures</ITAG>Section 601.25 Support Services3. <T3>Comment: </T3>Councils have indicated that the attendance of NOAA employeesat some types of Council meetings is often critical, and that under currentbudget constraints, has been limited by the prohibition against Councilreimbursement of NOAA employee travel. <T3>Response: </T3>The language suggested at the Council Chairmen's meetingwas adopted in andSection; 601.25(d)(1), which permits the Assistant Administratorfor Fisheries to approve, on a case-by-case basis, Council reimbursementfor NOAA employees' expenses to participate in Council activities. Section 601.27 Protection of Confidentiality of Statistics Section 601.27 specifies that Council procedures must be consistent withprocedures of the Secretary and the laws and regulations of a State submittingthem, and expresses NOAA policy with regard to Council member and staffaccess to confidential statistics, pursuant to Pub. L. 99-659. These regulationssupplement 50 CFR Part 603, which is being revised to regionalize the accesssystem. Section 605.21 specifies that the Council SOPP should include theseprocedures. 4. <T3>Comment: </T3>Councils suggested that it was unnecessary to repeatlanguage in the Magnuson Act concerning confidentiality in the regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>In general, NOAA repeats provisions of the MagnusonAct in all regulations or guidelines when the context requires it or forease of reference. No change was made. 5. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested deletion of the phrase requiring``documented need for unaggregated data'' prior to granting Council staffaccess. <T3>Response: </T3>NOAA modified the language in andSection; 605.27(b) asfollows: ``Council staff having a need for such [confidential] informationis granted access provided that the Council has established proceduresto ensure its confidentiality as required by the Magnuson Act.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">601 Subpart D_Membership </ITAG>Section 601.33 Appointments Section 601.33(b) defines ``knowledgeable and experienced'' to clarifythe basis on which Governors nominate and the Secretary appoints. Thissection also includes the Pub. L. 99-659 requirement that Governors consultcommercial and recreational fishing representatives in the nomination process,and that the Secretary ensure a fair apportionment of membership. In addition,NOAA is making a technical amendment, pursuant to the Pub. L. 99-659 requirementand recommended by the Fishery Management Study, to provide greater flexibilityfor the Secretary in choosing among names provided by the Governors. Anoath of office, also recommended by the Fishery Management Study, is included.6. <T3>Comment: </T3>Councils objected to stipulating the number of yearsof experience required to qualify for Council membership as being restrictiveand arbitrary. <T3>Response: </T3>Paragraphs 601.33 (b)(1)-(7) were accordingly modifiedto delete any specific number of years experience. 7. <T3>Comment: </T3>Councils and other commenters opposed eliminating the``obligatory'' and ``at-large'' designations for Council membership onthe basis that the current system had worked well and that eliminatingthe categories would create inequities in State representation or upsetcooperative relationships. Council Chairmen proposed language changes andexpressed interest in an amendment to the Magnuson Act stipulating thata statutory obligatory seat for each State be filled by appointment froma list of individuals submitted by that State. <T3>Response: </T3>Eliminating the designations in the proposed rule appearedto jeopardize the State's role in the selection of its two voting members.In order to clarify NOAA's intent, under the final rule the designationsare being retained and Council suggested language adopted to indicate (a)that each member State has one ``obligatory'' seat, (b) that when the termof the seat expires, the Secretary may fill it only from nominees for Councilmembership submitted by the Governor of that State, and (c) each State,pursuant to the Magnuson Act requirement, will have at least two votingmembers_the principal State official with marine fishery management responsibilityand expertise designated by the Governor, and the individual filling theState's obligatory seat, as selected by the Secretary from the Governor'snominees for Council membership, or persons who are knowledgeable and experiencedwith regard to the conservation and management of the recreational or commercialharvest of the fishery resources of that State. In order to implement Pub. L. 99-659, which requires the Secretary to ``ensurea fair apportionment, on a rotating or other basis, of the active participantsin the fisheries under Council jurisdiction'', the final rule allows theSecretary, when filling a State's obligatory seat, to select from any ofthe nominees for Council membership (i.e., either obligatory or at-large)submitted by the Governor of that State. This does not change the Governor'srole in nominating qualified individuals for the obligatory seat but providesthe Secretary more opportunity to implement his statutory responsibilityto balance the recreational, commercial, and processing interests on eachCouncil. Section 601.35 Rules of Conduct8. <T3>Comment:</T3> Councils questioned the application of section 601.35(b)(4)to Council staff members other than the Executive Director.<T3>Response:</T3> This section is accurate as written. In 1978, the NOAAOffice of General Counsel determined that Council staff members were coveredby the Federal conflict of interest laws. The Department of Justice andthe Office of Government Ethics of the Office of Personnel Management concurredin that opinion. Pub. L. 99-659 added the provision that exempts the ExecutiveDirector from the Federal conflict-of-interest law found at 18 U.S.C. 208when he or she is in compliance with the financial disclosure regulationsfound in Part 601. Sections 601.35 (a) and (b) were modified to clarifythis point. Section 601.35(b)(8)(i) was also modified to clarify that subsection(b)(8)(i) applies to matters of primarily individual concern, such as acontract, in which a member has a financial interest, as distinguishedfrom subsection (b)(8)(ii) which applies to general public policy matters,such as a fishery management plan, in which a member has a financial interest.A member can participate in the latter if the interest is reported, butnot the former.Section 601.37 Financial DisclosureThe financial disclosure requirements of Pub. L. 99-659 are set forth inandSection; 601.37 and, in a separate action, were published on October 6,1988, as a final rule at 53 FR 39303 in order to permit implementationof section 302(k) of the Magnuson Act as soon as possible. This actionrepublishes section 601.37 as a convenience to the reader, and, in addition,makes a technical correction to conform the regulation with section 302(k)of the Magnuson Act. Section 601.37 is reworded to read: (a) ``The MagnusonAct requires the disclosure by Council nominees, voting members appointedto the Council by the Secretary, and Executive Directors of any financialinterest . . .''. As clarified by the use of the more precise phrase ``votingmembers appointed by the Secretary'', the regulations reflect the statute'slanguage requiring nominees and voting members appointed to the Councilby the Secretary, as well as the Executive Director of a Council, to disclosecertain financial interests. Thus, the Regional Director and the principalState official designated by the Governor of a constituent State are notsubject to the disclosure requirements of section 302(k). This technicalchange resolves ambiguities accompanying use of the broader term ``votingmembers'', which could be interpreted to include voting members of theCouncil not appointed by the Secretary.Section 601.38 Security Investigations and ClearancesSection 601.38 provides expanded and updated instruction regarding thesecurity clearance process. Paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this sectionrequire the submission of any lawful non-disclosure agreement, requiredby the National Security Council or other lawful Directive, that may bedeveloped in the future.Section 601.39 Council Member Compensation10. <T3>Comment:</T3> Councils wanted to be permitted alternative methods ofpayment which allow deductions. As drafted, the regulations stipulate paymenton a contract basis without deductions.<T3>Response:</T3> Section 601.39(b) ``grandfathers'' current practicesthrough a specified period, but otherwise retains the language. For reasonsof equity, NOAA believes that the system of payment should be consistentfor all Councils. Alternative methods of payment require Federal paymentof benefits that do not otherwise have to be paid. Thus, consistency willresult in Federal cost savings.11. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 601.39(c) defines a compensable day for non-governmentCouncil members. One commenter objected, stating the belief that each Councilshould have the latitude to determine what activities will be compensated.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. NOAA believes it important to havea clear and uniform understanding of compensable activities in the interestsof fairness and equity among Councils and appropriate financial accountability.There is nothing to preclude Councils from including in their amended SOPPsany further restrictions they feel appropriate.12. <T3>Comment:</T3> Councils believe the requirement in andSection; 601.39(d)for a report of authorized Council member compensation to be unnecessaryand burdensome.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. NOAA needs this information to respondto requests from Congress and the public, and for making budget and policydecisions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 604_Other Applicable Law</ITAG>Part 604 groups ``other applicable law'', for ease of description, intothree general categories. Section 604.3 addresses the statutes dealingwith administrative operations and employment practices, which includethe Federal Tort Claims Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, conflict ofinterest statutes, Workmen's Compensation, and Unemployment Compensation.Section 604.4 addresses laws dealing with the fishery management decisionprocess, which require consideration of environmental, paperwork, and/oreconomic and social impacts, or establish rules of procedure for publicand State participation or access. They include the Administrative ProcedureAct, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act,the Regulatory Flexibility Act, E.O. 12291, E.O. 12612, and E.O. 12630.Section 604.5 addresses laws dealing with the uses of oceans and coastline,explaining how the following statutes affect the fishery management process:the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Endangered Species Act, the MarineMammal Protection Act, and the Marine Protection, Research, and SanctuariesAct.13. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several Councils expressed concern that, because Part604 is not guidelines, the descriptive summaries would have regulatoryeffect in and of themselves. Similarly, others worried that mention ofthe <T3>Operational Guidelines</T3> in this ``regulatory'' section constitutedadoption by reference.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA added language, at the Councils' suggestion, whichclarifies that Part 604 comprises abbreviated summaries of other law applicableto the FMP process. NOAA did not identify them as guidelines; it needsto be clear that these are the laws that the Secretary has determined tobe applicable to the fishery management process, and which must be compliedwith according to the regulations or agency directives specific to eachlaw. Referring to Part 604 as guidelines would create an ambiguity or bemisleading since it is a public listing of what the Secretary has determinedto be the ``other applicable law'' with which the FMPs must be found consistentunder section 304(a)(1)(B) of the Magnuson Act. Further, the status ofthe <T3>Operational Guidelines</T3> remains unchanged. The <T4>Federal Register</T4> requires specific ``adopt by reference'' languagewhen the intent is to adopt the contents of another document as part ofa regulation; that language is not included here.<ITAG tagnum="81">Part 605_Guidelines for Council Operations/Administration SubpartB_Operations</ITAG>Section 605.1 Purpose and Scope14. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several of the Councils wanted to clarify further thatthis section is actually guidelines by adding ``which do not have the effectof law'' to this section.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. NOAA has attempted throughout thisdocument to make it clear which parts have regulatory effect and whichdo not, and the relation of each to the other. The definition of ``guidelines''in Part 600 is the key: guidelines are intended to provide an indicationof future policy or conduct, as an aid to decisionmaking. The Part 605guidelines summarize Secretarial interpretations that will be applied underthe appropriate statutory and regulatory authorities.Section 601.13 Planning15. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 605.13(b) describes the data collection programauthorized under the Magnuson Act. Councils want to limit the number ofdays the Secretary may take to inform the Councils of the reason(s) fordisapproving a data collection plan to 60 days.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees and the language has been modified.Section 605.15 Establishment of Management Measures16. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 605.15(b)(3) sets forth guidance to assist inthe development of workable management measures. Councils stated a needto require, upon request, written comments from NOAA and the Coast Guardwithin 60 days pertaining to the feasibility and cost of enforcement andvessel safety.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA and the Coast Guard both agree to respond to Councilrequests for this information within 60 days, and the language has beenmodified accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">605 Subpart C_Administration</ITAG>Section 605.23(d) highlights the functions of the advisory groups and specificallydefines advisory group involvement in the fishery management planning anddevelopment process, as per Pub. L. 99-659. This section, in combinationwith Part 605, Subpart B, suggests an operational structure that respondsto recommendations from both commissioned studies and describes a processwhereby issues can be identified and resolved and available expertise calledupon on a continuing basis, including relevant NOAA offices, State andacademic scientists, advisory groups, planning teams, and others as appropriate.Section 605.24 Council Meetings and Hearings17. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the requirement in andSection;605.24(a)(2) that timely public notice of each regular or emergency meetingbe published in local newspapers, on the grounds that other notificationmethods are more effective and cheaper.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. The requirement is statutory.18. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 605.24(a)(3)(i) calls for a Council vote on applicationsfor foreign fishing. Councils could, and some do, by majority vote, delegateto the Executive Director or Chairman the authority to submit the Council'scomments on categories of foreign fishing applications to the Secretary.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA concurs with the Council practice and deleted therequirement for a vote on this matter.19. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some Councils questioned the prohibition of proxy votingas it might apply to Council member designees.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA changed the language in andSection; 605.24(a)(3)to clarify that voting by proxy is permitted by official designees as specifiedin andSection; 605.23(b).20. <T3>Comment:</T3> Councils object, on grounds of feasibility, to the requirementthat a minority report be submitted at the same time as that of the majoritywhen submitting any issue to the Secretary.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA believes it reasonable to change ``must'' to ``should''in andSection; 605.24(a)(3)(iv), with the understanding that Councils amendtheir SOPPs to include a time limit, as indicated in andSection; 605.21.Section 605.25 Employment PracticesSection 605.25 establishes guideline standards to be implemented in eachCouncil's SOPP, for staffing, recruitment, details, personnel actions,salary and wage administration, benefits, and travel reimbursement.21. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some Councils wanted to limit required budget justificationsfor positions to new positions only.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. NOAA believes that Councils shouldbe subject to the same budget justification procedures as all Federal entitiesreceiving Federal funds.22. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some Councils questioned the prohibition against contractingwith experts and consultants for the provision of services on a continuingbasis; others continue to be opposed to the requirement that Councils notifythe NOAA Office of General Counsel before seeking outside legal advice.<T3>Response:</T3> The NOAA Office of General Counsel determined in 1978that Councils could contract for the provision of outside legal services,subject to the Secretary's control over funding. This is implemented throughthe requirement that Councils notify the NOAA Office of General Counselbefore seeking outside legal advice, and that contracts not be enteredinto the for provision of legal services on a continuing basis. Throughan editing oversight, this prohibition was extended to all outside expertsand consultants. The language has been clarified to permit contractingfor all outside experts and consultants, other than for the provision oflegal services, on a continuing basis.23. <T3>Comment:</T3> Several Councils expressed concern regarding the provisionprohibiting lump sum payments for unused sick leave upon retirement, sincethey do not have a defined benefit pension plan based upon years of employmentand average salary which would allow unused sick leave to be credited uponretirement as additional time worked.<T3>Response:</T3> The language was modified in andSection; 605.25(g)(2)to accommodate this concern through permitting a deposit to be made toan employee's retirement fund for unused sick leave up to a maximum numberof days and contribution per day established by the Council as set forthin its SOPP.24. <T3>Comment:</T3> Councils were concerned that, with the rising cost ofhealth benefits, the restriction of employee benefits to 20 percent ofgross salary would work a hardship.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. If it becomes necessary to exceedthe 20-percent limit, Council submission of a higher amount would be consideredon an individual basis at the time of NOAA review and approval of a Council'sbudget.25. <T3>Comment:</T3> Councils expressed strong feelings about inequities oftravel reimbursement; they believe that the same per diem rates and otherreimbursement allowances should apply to Council, SSC, and AP members asCouncil staff, members of plan teams, and NMFS employees.<T3>Response:</T3> The distinction in travel reimbursement that the Councilsobject to was set up in the statute. Sections 302 (d) and (f)(7) of theMagnuson Act provide that the voting members of the Councils, certain non-votingmembers, and members of advisory groups established under section 302(g)shall be reimbursed for their actual expenses. Others traveling on Councilbusiness must use the government-wide system established pursuant to 5U.S.C. 5702 and 5703. The reason for this distinction is not clear, butthe interpretation is supported in the legislative history. It is clearthat during its deliberations, Congress differentiated between ``actualexpenses'' and those expenses allowable under 5 U.S.C. 5702 and 5703 andconsciously selected those Council officials who would be entitled to theformer and those who would be entitled to the latter.26. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some Councils objected to the provision restricting paymentof non-NOAA team members to travel expenses without other compensation.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. Compensation is limited to appointedCouncil members under the Magnuson Act. This does not prohibit Councilsfrom contracting for special services.Section 605.26 Financial ManagementSection 605.26 sets out the cooperative agreement requirements and detailsrelevant portions of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110governing financial management systems, procurement, property and spacemanagement, and financial reporting. It establishes audit schedules andcriteria for programmatic funding.27. <T3>Comment:</T3> Councils objected to listing all contemplated equipmentpurchases over $500 in their budget submission.<T3>Response:</T3> This provision was deleted. Government-wide regulationscovering procurement procedures and dollar amounts for itemizing equipmentpurchases are in the process of revision.28. <T3>Comment:</T3> One Council objected to the requirement for a monthlystatement of income/expenses.<T3>Response:</T3> No change was made. The provisions of andSection; 605.26(a)(1)(ii)describing a minimum Council accounting system represent a liberalizationof previous regulations.Section 605.27 RecordkeepingSection 605.27 addresses the requirements for FMP administrative records,Privacy Act records, and Freedom of Information Act requests.In summary, the proposed regulations/guidelines have been directed to providinguniform standards and guidelines which clarify the system and strengthenaccountability at both the administrative and programmatic levels.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere has determinedthat this rule is not a ``major'' rule under E.O. 12291 requiring a regulatoryimpact analysis. It prescribes agency policies and procedures and willhave no economic impact on the public until specific management decisionscontained within specific FMPs are made; until a given FMP is developedthere is no basis for evaluating the consequences of these management decisions.Economic impact on small entities is addressed at a later date throughregulatory flexibility analyses for individual FMPs. For the same reasons,the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theSmall Business Administration that this rule, if adopted, will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.This rule is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare anenvironmental assessment by NOAA Directive 02-10(5)(c)(3)(i). Section 601.37,published previously at 53 FR 39303, sets forth a collection-of-informationrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act and approved by theOffice of Management and Budget under Control No. 0648-0192.Public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to be one-halfhour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searchingexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingthe collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimateor any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden to Richard Roberts, NOAA Clearance Officer, 6010Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD 20852 and to the Office of Management andBudget, Information and Regulatory Affairs Paperwork Reduction Project0648-0192, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>50 CFR Part 600Fisheries.50 CFR Part 601Advisory groups, Fisheries.50 CFR Part 604Fisheries, Law.50 CFR Part 605Administrative practice and procedure, Fisheries.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612, andis issued in compliance with E.O. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.

Noperson may have access to classified information unless that person hasobtained a security clearance and it has been determined that access isnecessary for the performance of that person's official duties. Detailedprocedures governing applications for, and the issuance of, security clearancesare set forth in Department Administrative Order (DAO) 207-1, and the DOCPersonnel Security Manual. The authority having custody of the classifiedinformation determines whether the requester has a need to know the informationin the performance of the requester's official duties. Access to informationclassified as <T3>CONFIDENTIAL </T3>or <T3>SECRET</T3>, which is normally sufficient for Council purposes, requiresclearance at the noncritical-sensitive level.(b) All Council members, staff, and members of advisory groups are individuallyrequired to protect classified information and may be subject to sanctionsif they violate E.O. 12356, 18 U.S.C. 793, 794, or 952, or the NationalSecurity Act (50 U.S.C. 401 <T3>et seq.</T3>)(c) Security clearances are required for Executive Directors, and, priorto appointment, for all Council nominees. Other staff and advisory groupmembers may be required to obtain clearances at the Council's discretion.Those who have not been cleared may not participate in meetings, or portionsof meetings, closed for reasons of national security, or have access toany classified information.(d) Any person required to obtain a clearance must initiate the processby submitting:(1) An FBI fingerprint card (FD-258), and (2) A Standard Form 85, ``Data for Nonsensitive or Noncritical-SensitivePosition.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Form FD-258 is the standard fingerprint card used by the FBI.

Actual performanceof duties, for the purposes of compensation, may include travel time. (b) Effective September 1, 1991, all Council members whose eligibilityfor compensation has been established in accordance with NOAA guidelineswill be paid on a contract basis without deductions being made for SocialSecurity or Federal and State income taxes. Until that time, such deductionsmay be made at the Councils' option. A report of compensation will be furnishedeach year as required by the Internal Revenue Service. Such compensationmay be paid on a full day's basis whether in excess of eight hours a dayor less than eight hours a day. The time is compensable where the individualmember is required to expend a significant private effort which substantiallydisrupts the daily routine to the extent that a work day is lost to themember. ``Homework'' time in preparation for formal Council meetings isnot compensable. State officials may be compensated at the GS-18 levelif they can document they are on leave without pay (LWOP). (LWOP does notinclude annual leave, holidays, or weekends.) (c) Non-government Council members receive compensation for: (1) Days spent in actual attendance at a meeting of the Council or jointlywith another Council. (2) Travel on the day preceding or following a scheduled meeting that precludedthe member from conducting his normal business on the day in question.(3) Meetings of standing committees of the Council if approved in advanceby the Chair.

The list of laws affecting the Councils and their operations are grouped,for ease of description, into three general categories: those dealing withadministrative operations and employment practices; those dealing withthe fishery management decision process; and those dealing with other usesof the oceans and coastline. More detailed guidance is cited throughoutthis part and also appears in the NMFS <T3>Operational Guidelines.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;604.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Administrative operations and employment practices. </ITAG>Statutes in this category apply, in part, to Council staff, Council members,and members of Council advisory groups. These statutes include the FederalTort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 1291, 1346, 1402, 2401, 2402, 2411, 2412, 2671-80;the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201; the anti-lobbying statute,18 U.S.C. 1913; the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905; the bribery andconflict of interest statutes, 18 U.S.C. 201, 203, 205, 207, 208, 209,210, and 211; Workmen's Compensation, 5 U.S.C. 8101 <T3>et seq.; </T3>and Unemployment Compensation, 5 U.S.C. 8501 <T3>et seq. </T3>Applicability of these statutes is detailed in Part 601,Subpart D, and Part 605, Subpart C. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;604.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">The decision process. </ITAG>This category of laws applies to the fishery management decision process,and requires consideration of environmental, paperwork, and/or economicand social impacts, or establishes rules of procedure for public participationor access. These statutes include the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),5 U.S.C. 551-553; the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.4321; the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 49 U.S.C. 3501; and the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601. Procedures under these statutes andunder Executive Orders (E.O.) 12291, 12612, and 12630 are described asfollows: (a) <T3>Administrative Procedure Act (APA).</T3> Sections of the APA (5 USC551-553) establish procedural requirements applicable to decisionmakingof Federal agencies. The purpose is to ensure public access to the rulemakingprocess, protect the rights of individuals under the Privacy Act and makeavailable to the public information requested under the Freedom of InformationAct. The effect on the Magnuson Act process is: to require a minimum 15-to 30-day public comment period for proposed rules and a 30-day delayedeffectiveness date for final rules, with justification possible for waivingor shortening both; to require the Council to maintain security of personalrecords of Council members, employees, consultants under contract, andadvisory group members; and to require NOAA to respond to requests forinformation under specified criteria for denial and time limits. Requiredprocedures under these statutes are detailed in andSection;andSection; 605.25and 605.27.(b) <T3>E.O. 12291.</T3> This Executive Order (E.O.) applies to the proposal,issuance, and review of rules, and the development of legislative proposalsconcerning regulations. The E.O. requires that: regulatory objectives andpriorities be established with the aim of maximizing net benefits to society;rules be developed with a cost/benefit approach when possible; the chosenregulatory approach or alternative be the one with the least net cost tosociety; regulatory action not be undertaken unless the potential benefitsoutweigh the potential costs to society; and administrative decisions bebased on adequate information concerning the need for and consequencesof the proposed government action. The E.O. also requires that a semi-annualregulatory agenda be prepared. The effect on the Magnuson Act process isto require all rules to be reviewed by OMB unless covered by specific exemption,and to require a Regulatory Impact Analysis if the rule is ``major''. Aprior determination is made by the Secretary or his designee as to whetherthe rule is major or nonmajor and whether the rule complies with the aboverequirements based on a Regulatory Impact Review.(c) <T3>National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).</T3> NEPA requires that theeffects of Federal activities on the environment be assessed. NEPA's purposeis to ensure that Federal officials weigh and give appropriate considerationin policy formulation decisionmaking, and administrative actions to environmentalvalues and ecological, economic and social benefits and costs and thatthe public is provided adequate opportunity to review and comment on theimpact of major Federal actions. NEPA requires preparation of an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) for major Federal actions that significantly affectthe quality of the human environment. NEPA's effect on the Magnuson Actprocess is that a draft EIS, or environmental assessment for a findingof no significant impact, must be prepared. NEPA procedures are detailedin NOAA Directives Manual (NDM) 02-10.(d) <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).</T3> The PRA requires agencies to minimizepaperwork and reporting burdens whenever collecting information from thepublic. PRA's effect on the Magnuson Act process is that if an FMP requiresany form of information collection from the public, that collection mustreceive OMB approval. To obtain OMB approval, a written justification mustbe submitted. In addition, formal Council input is needed each Spring whenthe overall NMFS information collection budget request is formulated forsubmission to OMB. Procedures under the PRA are detailed in NDM 59-11.(e) <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).</T3> The RFA establishes the principlethat where Federal regulation is necessary, the regulation should be tailoredto the regulated entity's size and capacity to bear the regulatory burden.RFA's effect on the Magnuson Act process is to require a determinationof whether a proposed rule is likely to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. If the determination is affirmative,initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses must be prepared to accompanythe proposed and final rules respectively. If the determination is negative,the DOC General Counsel so certifies to the Small Business Administration.These analyses must consider the benefits and costs of compliance, withparticular emphasis on the effects of the rule on the competitive position,cash flow and liquidity, and ability of the small entity to remain in themarket. The RFA also requires a projection of reporting and record-keepingrequirements.(f) <T3>E.O. 12612.</T3> This E.O. requires Executive departments and agencies,in formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications(including proposed regulations), to be guided by federalism principlesand criteria. Federalism principles and criteria involve close consultationwith the States in any actions which have substantial direct effects onthe States or on the distribution of power and responsibility between andamong the levels of government. The Secretary or his designee determineswhich proposed policies have sufficient implications to warrant preparationof a Federalism Assessment. The effect on the Magnuson Act process is torequire the Councils to identify federalism issues before submitting managementprograms to the Secretary for approval. Any principal State official opposedto adoption of an FMP or amendment may file a dissenting report explainingthe nature of the State's objection and its relation to the policies ofthe executive order. (See andSection; 605.24(a)(3)(iv).)(g) <T3>E.O. 12630.</T3> This E.O. requires that each Federal agency preparea Takings Implication Assessment (TIA) for any of its administrative, regulatory,and legislative policies and actions that affect, or may affect, the useor value of any real or personal private property. These policies includeregulations that propose or implement licensing or permitting requirements,conditions, or restrictions otherwise imposed by an agency on the use ofprivate property, and actions relating to, or causing the physical occupancyor invasion of, private property. DOC is developing procedures to implementthe requirements of this E.O.; these regulations will be appropriatelyamended to implement the DOC procedures when they become available.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 604.5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Uses of oceans and coastline.</ITAG>This category of laws also applies to the fishery management process, anddeals with the competing uses of the ocean, the protection of certain livingmarine resources and their habitats, and the management of the nation'scoastal areas. These statutes include the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA),16 U.S.C. 1451; the Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1531; the MarineMammal Protection Act (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361; and Title III of the MarineProtection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA), 16 U.S.C. 1431. Proceduresunder these statutes are described as follows:(a) <T3>Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA).</T3> The principal objective ofthe CZMA is to encourage and assist States in developing coastal zone managementprograms, to coordinate State activities, and to safeguard the regionaland national interests in the coastal zone. Section 307(c) of the CZMArequires that any Federal activity directly affecting the coastal zoneof a State be consistent with that State's approved coastal zone managementprogram to the maximum extent practicable. CZMA's effect on the MagnusonAct process is to require determination that an FMP has no direct effecton the coastal zone, or is consistent with the State's approved coastalzone management program to the maximum extent practicable. Procedures underthe CZMA are detailed in 15 CFR Part 930.(b) <T3>Endangered Species Act (ESA).</T3> The ESA provides for the conservationof endangered and threatened species of fish wildlife, and plants. Theprogram is administered jointly by the Department of Interior (DOI), whichgenerally has jurisdiction over terrestrial and freshwater species, andthe Department of Commerce (DOC), which generally has jurisdiction overmarine species. With respect to endangered or threatened sea turtles, DOChas jurisdiction while the turtles are in the water and DOI while the turtlesare on land. Conflicts between the ESA and Federal actions are to be resolvedby a consultation process between the project agency and DOC and/or DOI,as appropriate. ESA's effect on the Magnuson Act process is to requirebiological assessment and consultation with NMFS or the Fish and WildlifeService (FWS) if an FMP or amendment may affect endangered or threatenedspecies or cause destruction or adverse modification of any designatedcritical habitat. The consultation must conclude that there is no likelihoodof jeopardy to any listed species, or, if jeopardy exists, reasonable andprudent alternatives approved by NMFS or FWS must be adopted before theFMP can be approved.(c) <T3>Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).</T3> The MMPA establishes a moratoriumon the taking of marine mammals and a ban on the importation of marinemammal products with certain exceptions. Responsibility is divided betweenDOC (whales, porpoises, seals, and sea lions) and DOI (other marine mammals)to issue permits and to waive the moratorium for specified purposes, includingincidental takings during commercial fishing operations. The Magnuson Actamended the MMPA to extend its jurisdiction to the EEZ. MMPA's effect onthe Magnuson Act process is that if the FMP has an effect on the marinemammal population, certain information must be included in the EIS, andthe FMP should indicate what authorization is needed for any incidentaltakings.(d) <T3>Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA).</T3> TitleIII of the MPRSA authorizes the Secretary to designate as marine sanctuariesareas of the marine environment that have been identified as having specialnational significance due to their resource or human-use values. The MarineSanctuaries Amendments of 1984 amend this Title to include, as consultativeagencies in determining whether the proposal meets the sanctuary designationstandards, the Councils affected by the proposed designation. The Amendmentsalso authorize the Council affected to prepare draft regulations for theSecretary's approval, consistent with the Magnuson Act national standardsand the goals and objectives of the proposed designation, for fishing withinthe EEZ as it may deem necessary to implement a proposed designation.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 605_GUIDELINES FOR COUNCIL OPERATIONS/ADMINISTRATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.1 Purpose and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.11 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.12 Use of available expertise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.13 Planning.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.14 Fishery management objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.15 Establishment of management measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.21 Council Statement of Organization, Practices, and Procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.22 SOPP checklist.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.23 Council organization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.24 Council meetings and hearings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.25 Employment practices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.26 Financial management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">605.27 Recordkeeping.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52"> Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;605.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and scope.</ITAG>(a) This part sets forth guidelines for the development of fishery managementplans and for the organization, practices, and procedures of the Councils.(b) The definitions, word usage, and abbreviations set forth in Part 600apply within this part.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Operations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;605.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>The primary functions of each Council are to develop, monitor, and evaluateFMPs, and propose amendments and associated regulations for each fisherythat requires conservation and management within its geographical areaof authority.

The proceduresestablished must ensure consideration of, and responsiveness to, the StockAssessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) report, economic and social impactanalyses, enforcement experience, public perceptions and proposals, managementpriorities and long-term management goals and objectives. In its planningprocess, the Councils should define the FMU, determine the need for management,identify data and information needs, examine the range of issues to beaddressed, propose management objectives, and schedule future actions.(b) <T3>Data Collection Program (DCP).</T3>(1) The Magnuson Act authorizes collection of information and data whichwould be beneficial in determining whether an FMP is needed for a fisheryor in preparing an FMP. Councils may request that the Secretary implementa DCP for a fishery which would provide the types of information and dataspecified by the Councils. If the need for data is justified for conservationand management and approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, theSecretary will approve such a DCP and issue proposed regulations to implementthe program within 60 days and establish an estimated date of availabilityof the data. If the Secretary determines the need for a DCP is not justified,the Council must be informed in writing of the reason(s) for the determinationwithin 60 days.(2) NOAA is authorized under the Magnuson Act and other statutes to collectproprietary or confidential commercial or financial information and providenonconfidential aggregations of such data to fulfill a Council's request.Information and data that would disclose proprietary or confidential commercialor financial information regarding individual fishing operators or fishprocessing operations would not be provided to the Council except as providedin andSection;601.27 and Part 603.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;605.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fishery management objectives.</ITAG>Each FMP and amendment, whether prepared by a Council or by the Secretary,should identify what the FMP is designed to achieve, i.e., the managementobjectives to be attained in regulating the fishery under consideration.(See andSection;602.10, national standard guidelines, which sets out therole of objectives in the development and review process.)<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;605.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Establishment of management measures.</ITAG>(a) The council develops management measures to achieve optimum yield (OY)and the management objectives of the Council.

The Council mustprepare draft regulations that implement the management measures for submissionto the Secretary with the FMP or amendment. Supporting documents requiredby other applicable law (see Part 604) must accompany the Council submission.Procedural details may be found in the NMFS <T3>Operational Guidelines.</T3>(b) Prior to the Council's adoption of the management measures:(1) The Council must prepare an analysis of the economic and social effectsof alternate management measures and their effectiveness in achieving theobjectives in the FMP. The analysis must discuss the need for Federal action,and the benefits and costs of each alternative, and the effects on smallentities and fishery-dependent communities. The analysis must include aconclusion concerning the expected net economic and social benefits tobe achieved by each alternative management measure or system. To the extentsuch net benefits cannot be quantitative, qualitative estimates must beprovided.(2) The SSC must advise the Council on the adequacy of all support analysesand whether they are based on the best scientific information available,and on the efficacy of proposed management measures.(3) NOAA and the Coast Guard, upon request of a Council, must provide writtencomments within 60 days pertaining to the feasibility and cost of alternativesrelative to enforcement and on vessel safety implications of the managementmeasures.(4) The Council may solicit comment from the AP, and any other interestedgroup or individual concerning the effects and probable effectiveness ofthe proposed alternatives.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart C_Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;605.21</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Council Statement of Organization, Practices, and Procedures (SOPP).</ITAG>Council SOPPs required under andSection;601.22 must, at a minimum, implementthe standards outlined below in this subpart.

(c) <T3>Designation of Regional Directors. </T3>The Regional Directors serveas voting members, on the Councils as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25 </C> <H1>Council </H1><H1>Regional director</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">New England <D>Northeast Region </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mid-Atlantic <D>Northeast Region</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">South Atlantic <D>Southeast Region </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Caribbean <D>Southeast Region </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gulf of Mexico <D>Southeast Region </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pacific <D>Northwest/Southwest Region \1\ </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">North Pacific <D>Alaska Region</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Western Pacific <D>Southwest Region</D><F>\1\ The Southwest Regional Director is the NMFS spokesman on the Counciland votes on fishery matters primarily or exclusively off California. TheNorthwest Regional Director is the spokesman and votes on fishery mattersprimarily or exclusively off Oregon and Washington.</F></ITAG></ITAG> (d) <T3>Advisory groups. </T3>Each Council must establish a Scientific andStatistical Committee (SSC) and may establish such other Advisory Panels(APs) as necessary or appropriate to assist it in carrying out its functions.Size is discretionary within the resources budgeted to the particular Council.Each Council must specify procedures in its SOPP for continuing involvementof its advisory groups in the development of amendment of FMPs. Proceduresfor appointing members of these groups should also be specified in theSOPPs.(1) <T3>Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC). </T3>The SSC provides expertscientific and technical advice to the Council on the development of fisherymanagement objectives and strategies, the scientific information supportingpreparation of FMPs the appropriateness of the ABC and OY levels, the adequacyof the regulatory analysis, and the effectiveness of FMPs once in operation.In providing this advice, the SSC assists the Council in identifying theneed for research and data collection and the scientific resources available,and in establishing criteria for framework actions. Membership must bemultidisciplinary, and should include biological and social scientistsfrom the Federal and State governments, and private scientific communitywho are knowledgeable about the fisheries to be managed. (2) <T3>Advisory Panel (AP). </T3>The AP provides pragmatic advice from individualsmost affected by, or interested in, Council matters of fishery management.A balanced representation should be maintained of those who are eitheractually engaged in harvesting, processing, marketing, or consuming fish,or knowledgeable and interested in the conservation and management of thefisheries within the Council's jurisdiction. With respect to each FMP oramendment under consideration by the Council, the AP should provide adviceconcerning the recommended OY, the management measures and allocationsunder consideration, the supporting documentation to any regulatory action,management objectives, and any other subject, as required by the Council.(e) <T3>Working groups. </T3>Fishery management planning and development ofFMPs may be performed by various types of working groups, under the directionof the Council. For example, the Council may establish a Plan Team to assessthe need for management, assemble information, conduct and evaluate analyses,evaluate public/industry proposals and comments, and estimate the costsof plan development, implementation, and monitoring. In addition, Councilsmay use <T3>ad hoc </T3> groups to address resource user conflicts or other issues.(f) <T3>Committees. </T3>The Council may appoint standing and <T3>ad hoc </T3>committees from among the voting and nonvoting membersas it deems necessary for the conduct of Council business. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.24 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Council meetings and hearings. </ITAG>In fulfilling the Council's responsibilities and functions, the Councilmembers may meet in plenary session, in working groups, or individuallyto hear statements in order to clarify issues, gather information, or makedecisions regarding material before them. To provide for review and decisionby the Secretary, recommendations of each of these groups must be documentedand available. The documentation must include, at a minimum, a statementof the problem, recommendations for corrective action, likely impact onthe affected resource, and likely impact on affected user groups. (a) <T3>Meetings</T3>_(1) <T3>General. </T3>The Councils meet in plenary session at the call of theChair or upon request of a majority of the voting members. Advisory groupsmay meet with the approval of the Chair. Emergency meetings may be heldat the call of the Chair or equivalent presiding officer. (2) <T3>Notice. </T3>With respect to the conduct of business at meetings ofa Council, and of the scientific and statistical committee and advisorypanels of a Council, timely public notice of each regular meeting and eachemergency meeting, including the time, place, and agenda of the meeting,must be published in local newspapers in the major fishing ports of theCouncil's region (and in other major fishing ports having a direct interestin the affected fishery) and such notice may be given by such other meansas will result in wide publicity. Timely notice of each regular meetingmust also be published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>(3) <T3>Conduct of meetings. </T3>(i) All meetings of the Council advisoryand working groups must be open, unless closed in accordance with paragraph(a)(5) of this section. Interested persons will be permitted to presentoral or written statements regarding the matters on the agenda at regularmeetings of the Council, within reasonable limits established by the Chair.A vote is required for Council approval or amendment of a fishery managementplan (including any proposed regulations), a Council finding that an emergencyexists involving any fishery, or Council comments to the Secretary on fisherymanagement plans developed by the Secretary. (ii) A majority of the voting members of any Council constitutes a quorumfor Council meetings, but one or more such members designated by the Councilmay hold hearings. (iii) Decisions of any Council are by majority vote of the voting memberspresent and voting (except for proposed removal of Council members, seeandSection; 601.36). Voting by proxy is not permitted except as allowed underandSection; 605.23(b). An abstention does not affect the unanimity of a vote.(iv) Voting members of the Council who disagree with the majority on anyissue to be submitted to the Secretary, including principal State officialsraising federalism issues, may submit a written statement of their reasonsfor dissent. If any Council member elects to file a minority report, itshould be submitted at the same time as that of the majority.(4) <T3>Record. </T3>(i) Minutes of each meeting must be kept and must containa record of the persons present, an accurate discription of matters discussedand conclusions reached, and copies of all statements filed.(ii) Subject to the procedures established by the Council under andSection;601.27, and the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under Part 603relating to confidentiality, the administrative record (including minutesrequired under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) of each meeting, andrecords or other documents which were made available to or prepared foror by the Council, SSC, or APs incident to the meeting, must be availablefor public inspection and copying at a single location in the offices ofthe Council. (5) <T3>Closed meetings. </T3>(i) Each Council, SSC, and AP: (A) Must close any meeting, or portion thereof, that concerns matters orinformation that bears a national security classification; and (B) May close any meeting, or portion thereof, that concerns matters orinformation that pertains to unclassified national security matters, employmentmatters, or briefings on litigation in which the Council is interested.(ii) Closed meetings must be announced in the news media. (6) <T3>Frequency. </T3>Each Council must meet in plenary session at leastonce every six months. Council advisory groups may meet as frequently asnecessary, with the approval of the Council Chair. (7) <T3>Location. </T3>(i) Each Council must conduct all meetings within itsgeographical area of concern, but may hold joint meetings within any oftheir constituent states for the purpose of discussing issues of mutualconcern. In the particular case of Council meetings of the North PacificCouncil, ``geographical area of concern'' means within the State of Alaska.When two or more Councils have been designated by the Secretary to preparean FMP jointly, Councils so designated may meet jointly within any of theirconstituent States for the purpose of developing or amending such an FMP.(ii) The Council meeting place should have a capacity large enough to accommodatethe anticipated public attendance and be accessible to those interestedin attending, including consideration of the cost of transportation andlodging. (b) <T3>Hearings</T3>_(1) <T3>General. </T3>The Magnuson Act directs the Councils to hold publichearings, at appropriate times and in appropriate locations in the geographicalarea concerned, to provide the opportunity for all interested persons tobe heard in the development of FMPs and amendments, and with respect tothe administration and implementation of the Magnuson Act. The term ``geographicalarea of concern'', for purposes of holding hearings, may include an areaunder the authority of another Council if the fish in the fishery concernedmigrate into, or occur in, that area or if the matters being heard affectfishermen of that area; but not unless such other Council is first consultedregarding the conduct of such hearings within its area. (2) <T3>Notice. </T3>Hearings must follow the same procedures for announcementas for Council and advisory group meetings. Timely public notice also shouldbe given to the local media where the hearing is to take place. Publicityshould be sufficient in time, substance, and area coverage to assure thatall interested parties are aware of the opportunity to make their viewsknown. (3) <T3>Conduct of hearings. </T3>When it is determined that a hearing is appropriate,the Chair of the Council must designate at least one voting member of theCouncil to officiate. All points of view must be given a reasonable opportunityto be heard. (4) <T3>Record. </T3>An accurate and timely report of the participants andtheir views must be provided in writing to the Council and maintained asa part of the Council's official records. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.25</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Employment practices. </ITAG>The following sets forth the responsibilities of the Councils with regardto personnel matters and establishes personnel-related standards. Councilmembers (except for Federal government officials) and staff are not Federalemployees subject to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations.(a) <T3>Staffing. </T3>Each Council may appoint and assign duties to an ExecutiveDirector and such other full- and part-time administrative employees asthe Secretary determines are necessary to the performance of Council functionsconsistent with budgetary limitations. The Executive Director is responsibleto the Council, and the staff is responsible to the Executive Director.Each position must be justified during the budget process described inOMB Circular A-110, or prior to filling a new position established duringthe course of the cooperative agreement year. Descriptions of the workto be performed must be submitted. (1) Council staff positions must be filled solely on the basis of merit,fitness, competence, and qualifications. Employment actions must be freefrom discrimination based on race, religion, color, national origin, sex,age, or physical handicap. (2) No employee of the Council may be deprived of employment, position,work, compensation, or benefit provided for or made possible by the MagnusonAct on account of any political activity or lack of such activity in supportof or in opposition to any candidate or any political party in any national,State, county, or municipal election, or on account of his or her politicalaffiliation. (3) In conducting official Council business, Council members and staffgenerally have the same protection from individual tort liability as Federalemployees on official actions, and are protected by the Federal workmen'scompensation statute, by the minimum wage/maximum hour provisions of theFair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and by the rights of access and confidentialityprovisions of the Privacy Act (PA). (4) Council staff are eligible also for unemployment compensation in thesame manner as Federal employees. (b) <T3>Experts and consultants. </T3>As long as funding is available in itsbudget, each Council may contract with experts and consultants as neededto provide technical assistance not available from NOAA. This includeslegal assistance in clarifying issues, but Councils must notify the NOAAOffice of General Counsel before seeking outside legal advice. A Councilmay not contract for the provision of legal services on a continuing basis.(c) <T3>Details of Government employees. </T3>All Federal agencies are authorizedby section 302(f)(2) of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. 1852(f)(6), to detailpersonnel to the Council on a reimbursable basis to assist the Councilin the performance of its functions. Nonreimbursable details are not precluded.Council requests to the heads of such agencies must contain the purposeof the detail, length of time, compensation to be paid, if any, and thestipulation that the Assistant Administrator be consulted prior to grantingthe request. Copies of this correspondence will be transmitted to the AssistantAdministrator through the servicing Regional Office. Federal employeesso detailed retain all benefits, rights, and status as they are entitledto in their regular employment. The Councils may negotiate arrangementswith State or local governments to utilize employees of those governments.Assistance in arranging these details may be obtained through the servicingRegional Office. (d) <T3>Personnel actions. </T3>Subject to these instructions, and within budgetarylimits, the Councils may establish positions, recruit, hire, compensateand dismiss personnel. Dismissal will be made for misconduct, unsatisfactoryperformance, and/or lack of funds, with reasonable notice to the employee.(e) <T3>Salary and wage administration. </T3>(1) In setting rates of pay forCouncil staff, the principle of equal pay for equal work must be followed.Variations in basic rates of pay should be in proportion to substantialdifferences in the difficulty and responsibilities of the work performed.(2) A cost of living allowance may be applied to the salaries of Councilmembers and staff whose post of duty is in one of the following areas:Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, andPuerto Rico. Members from American Samoa will receive post differential.The rate of cost of living allowance may not exceed that paid by the FederalGovernment in the same area. The current rates may be obtained from theapplicable NOAA field unit.(3) The duties of any new position must be contained in a brief descriptionto be submitted to the Regional Office assigned to a Council prior to thesubmission of a budget in which the salary of that position is requested.The Council will be provided a salary range appropriate to the positionand a determination of the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act.The Council then may fill the position at any salary level within thatrange; the policy of hiring at the beginning rate should be followed exceptin unusual cases when recruitment of an exceptionally qualified employeeis hampered thereby. The annual pay for any staff position may not exceedthe current rate for the top step of grade 15 of the Federal General Scheduleat any time.(f) <T3>Recruitment. </T3>All personnel vacancies should be filled on a competitivebasis, unless unusual circumstances clearly dictate otherwise. For thispurpose, the Council may avail itself of the vacancy advertising systemoperated by NOAA through the servicing Regional Office or any other recruitmenttool, including newspapers and local employment agencies.(g) <T3>Leave. </T3>Council employees should be granted paid leave for holidays,vacations or exigencies, sickness, and civil duties (e.g., jury duty, militaryreserve obligations) as determined by the Council. Councils should informemployees that leave is not transferable to or from Federal agencies. Leaveis subject to the following limitations:(1) <T3>Annual leave. </T3>Full-time Council employees may accrue annual leaveat rates not to exceed those for Federal employees. Part-time employeesaccrue leave at the same rate, per hours worked.(i)(A) Up to three years of service_maximum of 2 hours leave per 40 hours(13 days per year);(B) Three to 15 years_maximum of 3 hours per 40 hours (20 days per year);and (C) Over 15 years: maximum of 4 hours per 40 hours (26 days per year).(ii) If the Council so desires, it may credit prior Federal, State, orlocal government service for the purpose of determining leave accrual ofindividual employees. Application of such a policy must be uniform andpublic.(iii) Employees may carry over up to 240 hours (30 days) unused annualleave from one year to the next. Amounts remaining above 240 hours willbe forfeited. Employees who were authorized to carry over more than 240hours in accordance with Council SOPPs prior to the effective date of theseguidelines may continue under such policy. Under certain conditions, forfeitedannual leave may be restored if it was properly scheduled for use and circumstancesbeyond the employee's control caused the forfeiture. Approval for thisrestoration must be obtained from the Council Chair or his/her designee,who will refer to the NOAA Personnel Regulations and other source documentsfor guidance. Lump sum reimbursements not to exceed 240 hours carryoverplus current year earnings of unused leave are authorized upon employeeseparation. (Councils should neither budget nor account separately foranticipated or accrued leave costs payable upon employee separation. Shouldsuch costs arise and exceed Council funding availability, NOAA will defraythese costs in total.)(2) <T3>Sick leave. </T3>(i) Full-time Council employees may accrue sick leaveat the rate of two hours per week (13 days per year). Part-time employeesmay accrue at a percentage of the hours worked compared to 40 hours. A20-hour-a-week employee would accrue half the leave accrued by a 40-hour-a-weekemployee. Unused sick leave credit may be accumulated without limit. Lumpsum payments to the employee upon separation are not authorized. However,at retirement as defined in accordance with the provisions of the SocialSecurity Act or in the event of death of the employee, a deposit may bemade to the employee's retirement fund for unused sick leave up to a maximumnumber of days and contribution per day as established by the Council inits SOPP.(ii) In meritorious cases, Councils may advance up to one year's earningsof sick or annual leave when it is reasonably expected that the advancedleave will be repaid by the employee. This must be approved by the CouncilChair or designee (designation must be in writing).(h) <T3>Employee benefits. </T3>Employee benefits are identified in the CouncilSOPP, a copy of which should be provided to each employee. The Councilshould provide its employees the opportunity to participate in group medicalinsurance, life insurance, and retirement plans, and pay a reasonable proportionof the cost of such plans. Total employee benefits may not exceed 20 percent(exclusive of FICA) of employees' gross salary, without NOAA approval.(1) <T3>Medical insurance. </T3>Councils may provide group medical and dentalinsurance to their employees either through a commercial underwriter orthrough a State or local government program, if within the 20% total benefitlimitation. Councils are not authorized to increase employee salaries inlieu of a medical or dental insurance plan.(2) <T3>Life insurance. </T3>Councils may provide group life insurance foremployees, if within the 20% total benefit limitation. An increase in salaryin lieu of insurance coverage is not authorized.(i) <T3>Travel Reimbursement.</T3>(1) <T3>General.</T3>(i) Each Council must include travel reimbursement procedures in its SOPP.(ii) The per diem and actual subsistence rates contained in the NOAA TravelHandbook apply. (iii) Actual expenses include transportation by air coach, rail coach,bus or privately owned vehicle (automobile or private plane reimbursedon a per mile basis); room and meals within a reasonable limit establishedby the NOAA Travel Handbook; and incidental expenses such as taxi fares,parking, and telephone calls on official business. (iv) Coach air transportation must be utilized when available. Travel viafirst class air must be justified on the reimbursement voucher and approvedby the Council Chair or his/her authorized representative. Privately ownedvehicles (POVs) may be authorized when other modes of transportation areeither unavailable or inconvenient. When a POV is authorized for the convenienceof the traveler, the reimbursed costs must not exceed the costs of coachair fare. Accommodations equivalent to other-than-first-class should beutilized in the unlikely event that water vessel transportation is required.When sustantial savings can be realized by utilizing rail travel, thismode of transportation should be considered when available and adequate.(2) <T3>Council, AP, SSC Members. </T3>Section 302 (d) and (f) of the MagnusonAct provide that the voting menbers of each Council, the Executive Directorof the Marine Fisheries Commission on each Council, the additional non-votingmember of the Pacific Council, and members of advisory groups will be reimbursedfor actual expenses incurred in the performance of Council duties. Theyare not bound by the separate per diem limits for meals and lodging asset forth in the GSA Rules. They are subject, however, to the total reimbursementlimits established by the NOAA Travel Handbook for actual expenses, andthey must itemize their actual expenses up to the specified limit eachday. Lodging receipts are required. The rates are included in the GSA Rules.Federal employees serving in the above capacities are subject to the reimbursementrules of their agencies. (3) <T3>Council staff, members of plan teams, and others. </T3>Members of theCouncil staff and plan teams, invited experts, consultants, or others specificallyinvited, unlike those described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, mustadhere to the per diem limits or actual expense requirements set forthin the GSA Rules. (4) <T3>Non-NOAA team members. </T3>Non-NOAA team members may be reimbursedfor travel expenses but receive no other compensation from the Council.(j) <T3>Foreign travel. </T3>(1) Foreign travel must be approved, in advance,by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries or designee and by the GrantsOfficer. Requests for foreign travel approval should be submitted, in writing,at least 15 days in advance to the Assistance Administrator, through theNMFS Office of Management and Budget and the Grants Officer. Routine across-the-bordertravel to Mexico and Canada is exempt. (2) Each Council should specify in its SOPP any delegation of authorityto approve routine across-the-border travel which has been granted to itby NOAA. (3) Council Chairmen or their authorized representatives may approve routineacross-the-border travel to Canada or Mexico for Council members and employeeswithin specified Federal rates. (4) Domestic invitational travel for non-Council personnel may be approvedby the Council Chairman or his/her authorized representative. Foreign invitationaltravel must have approved as described in paragraph (j)(l) of this section.The per diem limits or actual expense requirements described above alsoare applicable to no-Council personnel traveling at Council expense. Paymentfor NOAA personnel from Council funds is not authorized.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 605.26 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Financial management. </ITAG>The Council's administrative operations are governed by OMB Circular A-110(Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Ageements with Institutionsof Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Non-Profit Organizations) andOMB Circular A-122 (Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations). A-110prescribes standards for financial management systems, procurement, propertymanagement, financial reporting, cash depositories, and grant close-outprocedures. Councils are required to comply strictly with the provisionson the Circulars and terms and conditions of the awards. (a) <T3>Cooperative agreements. </T3>Councils receive funds through cooperativeagreements for two basic types of expenditures: administrative (or operations)funds to cover general operating expenses, such as salaries, office space,utilities, travel, State liaison activities, etc., and programmatic (orcontract) funds primarily designed to fund contracts generated by the Councilsfor development of FMPs (including amendments) or FMP-oriented information.(1) <T3>Administrative. </T3>The funding for the administrative and technicalsupport of Council operations is included in the budget of the Departmentof Commerce and, through the Department, in the budgets of NOAA and NMFS.The funding requirements for the Councils are subject to regular budgetaryreview procedures. Annual or biennial grants and cooperative agreementswill provide such Federal funds as the Secretary determines are necessaryto the performance of the functions of the Councils and consistent withbudgetary limitations. Requirements for periodic reports for purposes ofNOAA budgetary control are described in individual grants and cooperativeagreements issued to the Councils.(i) <T3>Application for cooperative agreement. </T3>(A) The Council must submita formal application (Standard Form 424, Federal Assistance Short Form)to the appropriate Regional Director. This application includes a BudgetData Form, a Program Narrative Statement supporting the application, anda Statement of General Assurances. As backup to the Budget Data Form, eachCouncil must prepare a Budget Summary Worksheet for three fiscal/calendaryears. This Budget Data Form must reflect the amounts in lines A1 throughA8 of the Worksheet. The Program Narrative Statement should describe inappropriate detail the purpose for which funds are sought, e.g., operationalexpenses, FMP-oriented contracts, State liaison support.(B) Upon receiving a recommendation from the Regional Director (RD), theAssistant Administrator will review the application and transmit the applicationthrough the RD to the appropriate Grants Officer for processing. If theapplication is disapproved by the Assistant Administrator, the RD willbe contacted and supplied with the reasons for disapproval and the criteriafor resubmission.(ii) <T3>Accounting. </T3>A Cash Receipts and Disbursement Journal with a monthlySummary of Accounts is required as a minimum bookkeeping system. In addition,a Statement of Income and Expenses for the Council must be prepared monthlyfor the Council membership. Each cash disbursement must be approved bythe Council Executive Director or Administrative Officer. All checks foramounts more than $5,000 require two signatures_the Council Executive Directorand another person designated by the Council. The approval authority mustbe included in any SOPP published after the effective date of these guidelines.When budget estimates are submitted to the Assistant Administrator, theuniform account classification titles should be used.(iii) <T3>Advance of funds. </T3>A Letter of Credit will be established for eachcooperative agreement. Drawdowns from the Treasury will be made at thecommerical bank through electronic fund transfer from Treasury. The Councilshall initiate each drawdown at approximately the same time that checksare issued by the Council in payment of Council liabilities. Drawdownsshould not be made more frequently than daily or in amounts less than $5,000.These requirements are under the Department of the Treasury Circular 1075,``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances Under Federal Grantsand Other Programs'' (31 CFR Part 205).(2) <T3>Programmatic_</T3>(i) <T3>Nature of request. </T3>Councils may enter into cooperative agreementswith Federal agencies, State, and private institutions on matters of mutualinterest which further the objectives of the Magnuson Act. Approval fromthe Secretary of Commerce must be obtained prior to entering into sucharrangements, and each agreement must specify the nature and extent ofCouncil participation. The Councils are not authorized to accept giftsor contributions directly. All such donations must be directed to the NOAAAdministrator in accordance with applicable NOAA regulations.(ii) <T3>Criteria.</T3> NOAA has established the following criteria to guideeach year's decisions on programmatic funding:(A) Proposed projects must be directly related to the formulation of anFMP, amendment, or emergency action (including data collection necessaryto determine whether an FMP should be formulated); necessary to evaluatean FMP already in place; or, necessary to obtain information for use inframework FMP management actions.(B) Proposed projects must be short-term, preferably one year or less butgenerally not longer than two years.(C) Proposed projects must avoid duplication of effort and operate as costefficiently as possible in order to maximize benefits for Federal expenditures.When a Council has identified data needs for a particular fishery, availableresources from NOAA, the States, Office of Sea Grant, academic institutions,and other established sources of information should be utilized to avoidduplication of effort. If certain biological, ecological, economic, orsocial data is needed on a high-priority basis which cannot readily besupplied free-of-charge by NMFS or other institutions, the Councils maybe authorized to contract for the information collection and analysis.The SSC of each Council should assist in identifying immediate and longer-rangeresearch and data needs.(iii) <T3>Procedure. </T3>(A) Requests for programmatic funding may be submittedat the same time as the Council's administrative budget, or at other timesas requested by the Assistant Administrator. Documentation should includea cover letter explaining the need for the project, how it contributesto an FMP (proposed, developing or existing), and how it meets criteriaoutlined in this section. An additional factor that is considered duringNOAA review is documentation jointly submitted by the Regional Directorand Chief Scientist stating that needed information is not available fromNOAA or other sources and establishing regional priorities among the variousCouncil requests.(B) Competing project proposals which meet the above criteria may be fundedbased on an evaluation of urgency of problem to be addressed, impact offailing to fund, impact of delay in funding, and importance and size offishery.(C) Programmatic contract services always must be described in the contextof overall Council plans in a particular programmatic area. The relationshipof individual contracts to past and projected goals must be reflected inall Council applications for contract funds.(b) <T3>Procurement</T3>. Draft contracts or solicitations relating to thedevelopment or monitoring of FMPs must be submitted to the RD. Proposedsole source procurements over $5,000 and purchases or leases of automateddata processing (ADP) equipment must also be submitted to the RD priorto award. Solicitations will not be released, nor contracts awarded, untilall substantive issues noted by the RD have been satisfactorily resolved.Proposed sole source contracts over $10,000 must be approved in writingby the Grants Officer. Final copies of all contracts awarded will be filedwith the appropriate Grants Officer. The cost and financial managementprinciples outlined in OMB Circulars A-122 and A-110 apply to all Councilprocurement actions.(1) To avoid duplication of work, efforts must be made to use existingsupport sources (Federal, State, other Councils, etc.) before commercialsources are sought.(2) Competition must be held for all commercial purchases over $5,000 unlessthe unique nature of the procurement, unforeseen time constraints, and/orsubstantiated overall savings (administrative plus contractual) clearlydictate otherwise. All sole source procurements above $5,000 with individualsand commercial vendors will be documented and reviewed by the RD as describedabove. Such purchases over $10,000 must be approved by the Grants Officer.Internal Council evaluations may be made on unusual and large procurementsto ensure their legality, economy, and viability, or the Council may delegatesuch authorization to its Executive Director or Chair.(3) Efforts must be made to inform minority firms of planned Council procurements.The <T3>Commerce Business Daily </T3>(CBD) should be considered by each Councilas a means of publicizing contemplated contracts.(4) The purchase or lease of ADP equipment by Councils and its subcontractorsrequires prior approval by the RD. Such approval will be made only aftera cost-benefit analysis (system life cost, lease vs. purchase, compatibility,etc.) by the Council demonstrates the economy of the proposed action.(5) Councils are authorized to purchase supplies and services from GSAdirectly. Individual accounts have been set up for each Council, and informationis available through Regional Offices.(c) <T3>Property management</T3>. A listing of Federally-owned (Council) propertymust be submitted to the Grants Officer annually. Theft of Council propertyshould be reported promptly to local law enforcement personnel, includingthe FBI, the Grants Officer, and to the Regional Office. Property managementprocedures must ensure adequate control and protection of Council propertyat all times. Such procedures are included in Council's SOPP, and mustinclude the following as a minimum:(1) A perpetual inventory system for all nonexpendable items, e.g., officeequipment, furniture, etc.;(2) Procedures for marking such items as Council property;(3) Provision for safeguarding sensitive items such as cameras and biologicalequipment. Insurance should not be obtained.(4) Procedures to be followed in disposing of surplus items;(5) Listing of all personnel, including consultants if appropriate, authorizedto have access to Council property.(d) <T3>Space management</T3>. Economy should be exercised regarding the amountand cost of space acquired. When acquiring office space, Councils may availthemselves of the following:(1) General Services Administration leasing assistance;(2) Regional Office assistance;(3) Direct negotiations within the guidelines stated above.(e) <T3>Accounting system</T3>. Councils must maintain a document-oriented,obligation-accounting system (with accruals, as necessary, for budget projectionpurposes) rather than a cash-accounting system. Actual journals and ledgersmust be maintained either manually or on an automated system; in eithercase, however, all obligations must be clearly documented and organizedin order to provide quick access and verification by professional auditors.The actual composition (chart of accounts) of the system may vary somewhatfrom Council to Council. As a minimum, however, the system must providefiscal control over expenditures in line with those object classes depictedin the Council budget submission. This will allow not only timely submissionof the periodic financial status reports, but will also ensure close coordinationbetween actual spending rates and budgeted amounts so that comparisonsand changes can be made at any time. All financial records must be handledin accordance with OMB Circular A-110.(f) <T3>Audits.</T3> An independent audit is required at least biennially byDOC Office of the Inspector General auditors or an independent public accountant(IPA). All Councils are subject to audit by the DOC Office of the InspectorGeneral and the General Accounting Office.
