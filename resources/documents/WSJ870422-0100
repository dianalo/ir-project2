Chicago-based Bally said it would receive $350 million in cash from Wesray, and that Wesray would liquidate $250 million of Six Flags debt currently carried by Bally. Bally said it expects to complete the sale next month and to post a $100 million gain on the transaction.    The move, which Bally said last month it was considering, further concentrates the company's business on the gambling industry. Bally owns casinos and makes gambling and amusement equipment.    As previously reported, Bally has been realigning its business and recently beat back a takeover threat from New York real-estate developer Donald Trump.    Bally said the theme park unit had operating profit of about $48 million last year on revenue of about $370 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Bally shares rose 75 cents to close at $19.25.    Closely held Wesray, controlled by former Treasury Secretary William Simon and other investors, will temporarily finance the purchase with a so-called bridge loan from Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., an investment banking firm. Wesray is one of the nation's biggest leveraged buyout firms. In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired concern.    Three other bidders for the theme park operations all made offers within only $50 million of the winning Wesray bid, according to executives involved in the bids.    Lorimar-Telepictures Inc. and MCA Inc., two Los Angeles-based entertainment concerns, jointly bid $50 million less than Wesray, according to executives at the companies. Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, a New York firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, and Saul Steinberg's Reliance Capital Group L.P., a partnership managed by a unit of Reliance Group Holdings Inc., each made bids that were closer to the Wesray proposal, according to executives.    A spokesman for Reliance acknowledged the company made a bid for the property, but declined to elaborate. Gibbons Green didn't return phone calls seeking comment.    MCA and Lorimar executives, who declined to be identified, acknowledged that they had made bids for the properties, which they said they wanted to operate as a separate joint venture unit. MCA already operates theme parks, including its Universal Studios Tour, and is expanding that business in Florida.    One executive involved in the bidding speculated that Wesray is unlikely to operate the parks and may ultimately sell them or take them public. This executive said that is &quot;the only way the Wesray price makes any sense,&quot; because the theme parks require an annual investment of about $30 million to upgrade the properties and add new rides.    Wesray officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
