However, an NYSE spokesman said Tuesday the exchange would waitfor Drexel to settle the sweeping criminal securities fraud casebrought against it by the federal government before deciding whatsanctions if any to impose on the investment firm.   Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650million in penalties to settle its criminal case, which involvedalleged securities law violations stemming from the insider tradingscandals linked to now-jailed speculator Ivan Boesky.   NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said in an interview with theWall Street Journal that the settlement represents ``the biggestfailure of the (supervisory) system in the history of the financialmarkets.''   Phelan did not specify what sanctions were being considered, butthe exchange could fine, censure or suspend the firm and employees.Issues before the exchange include whether top Drexel officialsfailed to supervise employees properly.   ``The last thing we want to do is come out looking like a wimp,''Phelan said.   Phelan made comments last week that raised doubts about whetherthe NYSE would follow up on the federal sanctions being leviedagainst Drexel by the Securities and Exchange Commission and theJustice Department.   ``I'm not sure what purpose we would serve by adding any more tothat since the commission could have done everything including bar(Drexel) as a broker-dealer,'' he told a group of reporters.   Exchange officials maintain Phelan was not indicating theexchange would not take action against Drexel.   ``We have not yet determined what action if any the New YorkStock Exchange will take in the Drexel case,'' spokesman RichTorrenzano said. ``That determination will be made in the comingweeks and months once federal regulators have completed all of theirdeliberations and settlements.''   A federal judge last week approved a civil settlement between theSEC and the firm that places Drexel under strict supervision forthree years. Approval of the separate criminal settlement is pendingbefore another judge.   Once that happens, Phelan said, ``we will go full blast.''   ``The exchange has been talking to the SEC and has been examiningthe SEC's proposed settlement,'' Torrenzano said.   In 1985, the NYSE fined E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. $400,000 and censuredits president and chief financial officer for failing to supervisethe firm properly after Hutton pleaded guilty to federal mail andwire fraud charges in a wide-ranging check-kiting scheme.</TEXT></DOC>
