Arco's net income fell 41% to $351 million, or $2.17 ashare, from $592 million, or $3.55 a share, a year earlier.The year-earlier results included a $323 million gain from achange in accounting, partly offset by $233 million incharges for income tax provisions and future environmentalcleanup costs. Revenue rose 11% to $4.7 billion from $4.22billion.</LP><TEXT>   Unocal's net fell 2.6% to $75 million, or 32 cents ashare, despite a $22 million gain from a natural gas contractsettlement. In the year-earlier quarter, Unocal earned $77million, or 33 cents a share, including a $12 million taxcredit. Revenue rose 2.8% to $2.72 billion from $2.64billion.   Despite the sharp drop in net for Arco, operating resultswere better than anticipated, and Wall Street pushed thecompany's shares up 50 cents to close at $130.625 in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Unocal'searnings, hurt by a loss in refining and marketingoperations, were somewhat less than expected, and its sharesfell $1 to close at $26.75 in Big Board trading.   Although both companies boosted their world-wide oil andgas production in the latest quarter, it wasn't enough tooffset lower domestic prices for crude oil and natural gas.Arco's average domestic price for crude fell $1.14 a barrelto $13.58, while Unocal's fell $1.17 to $16.43. Arco'saverage domestic gas prices fell 21 cents to $1.68 a thousandcubic feet, and Unocal's fell 13 cents to $1.93.   Arco's world-wide production of crude oil and natural gasliquids rose to an average 743,800 barrels a day from723,300, while natural gas production was little changed atnearly 1.9 billion cubic feet a day. Unocal's dailyworld-wide crude production rose to 264,800 barrels from232,100, and gas production rose to 1.54 billion cubic feetfrom 1.31 billion.   In the battle at the pumps, Unocal was the big loser asits strategy of offering more services in exchange for highergasoline prices backfired during the recent price wars.Unocal had a $6 million loss in its refining, marketing andtransportation segment, compared with profit of $11 million ayear earlier. The company blamed the loss on increasedcompetition on the West Coast, as well as lower earnings fromits Uno-Ven Co. joint venture in the Midwest. Total sales ofpetroleum products in the quarter fell to 427,200 barrels aday from 438,100 barrels a day.   Unocal plans to close between 200 and 300 of its 1,900branded service stations on the West Coast over the nextthree years, Roger Beach, president of the company's refiningand marketing division, said at yesterday's annual meeting.Mr. Beach said Unocal's West Coast stations average sales of90,000 gallons a month -- roughly half those of Arco, themarket leader in the region. Arco's refining and marketingsegment earned $74 million in the quarter, up from $72million a year earlier.   A group of dealers demonstrated outside Unocal's annualmeeting, held at company facilities in Brea, Calif.,complaining that the company's terms for their operationsaren't competitive with those of other oil operations.Richard Stegemeier, Unocal's chairman, president and chiefexecutive officer, said the company was aware of the dealers'problems, adding that &quot;there is a lot of competition outthere right now.&quot; He said the company was working with itsservice station operators to improve conditions, but declinedto elaborate.   Unocal's move to sell off its least productive West Coastgas stations is in line with its earlier decision to reviewall of its assets to consider whether returns are sufficient.In February, the company put up for sale its petroleummarketing and distribution operations in the Southeast, aswell as its nationwide truckstop network. And last month,Unocal said it would shutter its troubled experimental shaleoil production facility in Parachute Creek, Colo. Thatoperation was largely responsible for the $8 millionfirst-quarter loss in the company's &quot;other&quot; segment, whichincludes minerals and real estate. Those operations had $1million in profit in the year-earlier period. Profit fromUnocal's geothermal operations was flat at $6 million.   Unocal's earnings from chemical operations rose to $10million from $6 million, while Arco's earnings from its83.4%-owned Arco Chemical Co. fell to $52 million from $71million and its earnings from 49.9%-owned LyondellPetrochemical Co. fell to $50 million from $84 million, whichincluded a $45 million gain.   ---   Frederick Rose contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
