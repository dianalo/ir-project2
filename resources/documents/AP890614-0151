The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quotedAli Jan Zahedi as saying representatives of the groups reached theaccord this month.   Zahedi said that once ratified, the agreement would supersede theexisting interim government, in which Iran-based rebels are notrepresented.   The U.S.-backed rebels, known as the mujahedeen (Islamic holywarriors), are split into the Iran-based Shiite Moslem coalition andthe mainstream Sunni Moslem alliance based in Pakistan.   The Sunni rebels formed the existing interim government soonafter the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afhganistan was completed inFebruary. They predicted that President Najib's Marxist regime inKabul would quickly collapse, but government troops held theirground and Najib now is calling for a cease-fire and negotiations.   The Shiite coalition originally boycotted the provisionalgovernment when it was refused all the seats it demanded. The Sunniscame courting again, however, after suggestions emerged that theShiites might cut a separate deal with the Soviets and fragment therebel movement.   Shiites make up 15 percent of Afghanistan's population.   In recent fighting in Afghanistan, guerrillas said Wednesday thattheir artillery attacks forced Afghan officials to close the airportoutside Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, during dayhours.   The airport, in Afghanistan's arid south, was closed Tuesdayafter heavy fighting between rebels and communist forces, said theguerrilla-controlled Afghan News Agency based in Pakistan.   A steady barrage of rocket fire halted government flights, saidthe agency, which speaks for Gulbadin Hekmatyar's radicalHezb-i-Islami rebel group.   Kandahar lies about 270 miles south of Kabul and is the home ofAfghan royalty.   Akbar Nakyar, a spokesman for the National Islamic Front ofAfghanistan rebel group, said the latest report reaching Quetta,Pakistan, was that government aircraft still could make nightlandings.   The Moslem guerrillas began an insurrection after a communistcoup in Afghanistan in 1978. The war has killed at least 1.3 millionpeople and about 5 million Afghans _ a third of the population _have fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran.   Guerrillas have not been able to capture a major city but havewide control of the countryside.</TEXT></DOC>
