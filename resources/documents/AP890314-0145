However, President Bush told Congress in February he would cutback the military build-up plans of former President Reagan. So thestatistics in the latest Selected Acquisition Report releasedTuesday ``have already been overtaken by events,'' said Jim Turner,a Pentagon spokesman.   The update is based on the budget and policy guidelines of theReagan administration because Congress mandates the review beconducted every Dec. 31, Turner said.   Nonetheless, the report outlines the priorities of the servicesand the budget items over which Bush, Congress and the military arelikely to clash.   As of Dec. 31, the Pentagon said the 94 key programs that Reaganwas pursuing carried a combined pricetag of $818.6 billion, up $57.5billion or 7.6 percent from a quarterly estimate last Sept. 30.   Of the increase, $42.7 billion was attributed to changes inpurchasing plans for the middle and late 1990s. And of the $42.7billion, more than 40 percent stemmed from changes to just threeNavy programs _ big jumps in orders for the DDG-51 destroyer and theSSN-21 Seawolf submarine, plus an increase in orders for Trident IImissile submarines and missiles.   Other programs that had won the blessing of the outgoing Reaganadministration for purchase increases in the ``out years'' includedthe Army's M-1A1 tank, AH-64 attack helicopter and UH-60 Blackhawktransport helicopter; the Marine Corps' air-cushioned landing craft,and the Air Force's Titan IV rocket booster for unmanned satellitelaunches.   Pentagon officials declined comment Tuesday on how those andother purchasing plans might change.   The Selected Acquisition Report is a review of all major weaponsprograms and is designed to provide a broad gauge of how well thePentagon is doing in managing its weapons buying.   The reports do not reflect any change in a program unless thereare major schedule delays or an increase of at least 5 percent inthe cost. The reports do not disclose when the last year of buyingfor each weapon is scheduled.   In the December report, most of the programs showing costincreases were cited because of changes in the size of the order asopposed to management problems. Of the $57.5 billion increase, $2.9billion was attributed to scheduling problems or changes and $6.9billion to revised contract estimates, compared to the $42.7 billionattributed to quantity changes.   The report shows the Navy planned to increase by 10 the number ofDDG-51 destroyers it purchased _ to a new total of 33 _ as well asincrease from five to 12 the number of SSN-21 Seawolf submarines itpurchased.   Both of the those ship types are now in development and have yetto enter the fleet.   The Navy also planned to increase from 11 to 13 the number ofhuge Trident II nuclear submarines it purchased.   The Air Force planned to buy 34 more Titan IV rocket boosters ontop of the 23 originally approved, and the Army planned to buy 1,460additional M-1A1 tanks, increasing its total buy to 9,317.</TEXT></DOC>
