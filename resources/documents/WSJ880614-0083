G-H Acquisition Corp., a newly formed unit of Gurit Heberlein AG of Wattwil, Switzerland, offered $24 a share last month for as many as 4,960,000 shares, or 61%, of Essex's common stock. Essex yesterday called the offer &quot;inadequate&quot; and said holders shouldn't tender any shares.    Essex said its board has told management to study alternatives including the sale of all or part of Essex. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Essex said it &quot;has held and is continuing to engage&quot; in talks with third parties about such a sale. The board said other possibilities include a financial restructuring, or the sale of new stock or debt securities.    As previously reported, Essex also has filed suit in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleging that G-H violated U.S. securities laws by acting on &quot;material non-public information&quot; it obtained as a partner in a European joint venture with Essex. G-H at the time said it regarded the suit as without merit.    L. John Polite Jr., chairman of Essex, said yesterday, &quot;I continue to be shocked and dismayed that Gurit, our Swiss joint venture partner, would violate our trust&quot; through the tender offer. He called the offer &quot;unethical and illegal, and . . . in complete disregard for Gurit's fiduciary duties.&quot;    Essex produces specialty chemical products, including refrigerant gases and organic intermediate chemicals. For 1987, it had a loss of $16.6 million on sales of $208.8 million. At $24 a share, the company would have a market value of about $192 million, disregarding possible conversion of debentures.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Essex Chemical's stock closed at $31.875, up $1.125. </TEXT></DOC>
