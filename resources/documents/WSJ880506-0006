While he impugns the credibility of seasoned reporters of both the New York Times and the Washington Post by implying they were duped by State Department propagandists, he evidently has decided to assist the Cuban effort to overturn the decision in Geneva calling for a U.N. investigation into all aspects of Cuban human-rights practices. Unfortunately, he never bothered to check his &quot;facts&quot; or his premises with any knowledgeable U.S. government officials or people who do not share his and Prof. Evenson's evident fondness for Castro's Cuba and their bias against the Reagan administration.    The U.S. resolution did not accuse Cuba of human-rights abuses. It drew attention to numerous reports from former political prisoners and private human-rights organizations, both inside and outside Cuba, that serious and widespread abuses occur in Cuba. The resolution also noted favorably that over the past year the government of Cuba has released some political prisoners. In short, our resolution was nonjudgmental and balanced.    Mr. Cockburn might have served himself and his readers a little better had he bothered to check the provisional agenda adopted by the U.N. Human Rights Commission for its next session. The agenda clearly places the report of the investigative commission under Item 12 where the countries that the U.N. considers the worst human-rights violators are discussed.    Those who dispute whether the decision in Geneva was a victory or a defeat for the U.S. should read the transcript of Maria Shriver's February interview with Fidel Castro in which Castro makes it plain that at that point he had no intention of allowing a U.N. investigative team into Cuba. What caused Castro's sudden change of heart if it was not his assessment that the U.S. resolution would pass?    Mr. Cockburn's allegations against Armando Valladares merely parrot the Cuban disinformation campaign against him and are most unfair. Cuban disinformation was carried to rather extreme lengths. If anything, such transparent disinformation demonstrates that Castro concentrated his effort on discrediting the head of the U.S. delegation because he could not refute the detailed evidence of systematic human-rights violations in Cuba that Mr. Valladares and other members of the U.S. delegation presented. It is a tried and true communist ploy that when facts are incontrovertible, attack the intentions of the person presenting them.    After the Cuban vice foreign minister held a press conference in Geneva in an attempt to defame our representative, a major wire-service reporter challenged Mr. Valladares to prove that he had been tortured during his 22 years in Castro's prisons. Mr. Valladares allowed the reporter to feel his scalp, which bore the lumps and scars inflicted by his tormentors, and then displayed his leg, which is disfigured after having been broken by Cuban guards and never properly set.    That reporter did not raise again the question of Mr. Valladares's credibility.    Mr. Cockburn may believe that what happened in Geneva was a setback for the U.S. Castro evidently believes otherwise. The day after the decision was taken the four members of the Latin American delegations who had brokered Castro's offer challenged the decision that had been agreed to by consensus the previous day. For four hours they endeavored to undo that agreement. We have no doubt that Castro and his surrogates will grasp at any straw to prevent the investigation from going forward according to the Geneva decision. We would invite Mr. Cockburn to visit New York in May when the U.N. Economic and Social Council will take up this matter so that he too may &quot;observe the mood&quot; instead of relying on biased and inaccurate secondhand information.
