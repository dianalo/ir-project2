As the father of two young boyswho have had access to computers for years, I can attest thatkids must still hit the books, as well as the keyboard, tosucceed in school.   Still, children can get both pleasure and knowledge out ofcomputers and software. Just gaining a mastery of thekeyboard and mouse can help prepare them, in some small way,for the world they'll face.   The trouble is, parents have a hard time choosingchildren's software. Every program bills itself astechnically and educationally superior, implying that makingthe wrong choice will prevent your kid from getting intoHarvard.   So here's a selection of kids' programs that combine funwith some degree of skill building and learning, even if it'sonly learning how to use a computer. These packages havewithstood hands-on use by an unscientific panel of kids, myown and others, ranging in age from two to 13. The list hasno shoot-'em-up games, and the software included isappropriate for both boys and girls. Prices are approximatediscount-store or mail-order levels.   A few cautions are in order. First, this list is by nomeans exhaustive. Second, many of these programs require anadult's presence, at least for a while, and especially if thechildren are young. Finally, to discourage copying, many ofthese programs require repeated use of the manuals and masterdisks, so don't let your children misplace them.                                                                                                          KID PIX: This $35 computer art program, from Broderbund,was designed from the ground up to make it easy for kids to&quot;paint&quot; in vivid colors, on the screen, with a mouse. A widevariety of drawing effects and tools can be easily selected.Each tool also makes an appropriate sound: Pencils soundscratchy, paint brushes drip audibly. Children don't evenneed to know how to use the keyboard: They can add words topictures by clicking on a list of letters (the program evenpronounces each letter selected).   There are many special effects not found even on expensiveadult art programs, including a rubber &quot;stamp&quot; with which achild can imprint pre-drawn pictures. And there's a &quot;smallkids mode&quot; grown-ups can use to disable features that mightpermit a curious tyke to save or open files, or wear outprinters. The program is available for both IBM-compatiblecomputers and Apple's Macintosh.                                                                                                          CARMEN SANDIEGO: In this wildly popular series of games,priced at about $30 each, children take the role ofdetectives pursuing a gang of thieves led by the notoriousCarmen Sandiego. To catch the villains, players must chasesuspects around the country and world, and even back in time.Pursuing them involves interpreting clues of geography,history, art and music. To help, the games come packaged withreference books, such as the World Almanac.   The first entry in the series, &quot;Where in the World IsCarmen Sandiego?&quot; was such a success that Broderbund hasissued several others, focusing on different regions andtimes. There are Carmen Sandiego games for IBM-compatibles,Macintoshes and other computers.   Children do seem to pick up some knowledge by osmosis withthese games. The other day, while discussing his geographyhomework, my fourth-grader casually mentioned thatSwitzerland was divided into cantons.                                                                                                          SUPER SOLVERS: This series of games, from Learning Co., atabout $40 each, takes grade-school kids on adventures thatrequire good problem-solving skills. The object is tooutsmart a villain who is, variously, trying to steal ancientartifacts or seize a school or TV station. All four games areavailable for IBM-compatibles; one, called, &quot;Outnumbered,&quot; isalso available for Macs.                                                                                                          THE PLAYROOM: Another Broderbund product, this $35 gamefor IBM-compatibles and Macintoshes lets preschoolers explorea toy-filled room. Certain objects, when selected with themouse, bring up games that teach basic skills, includingmatching and arranging objects, counting and more. There'salso a companion game, called the Treehouse, for children sixto 10.                                                                                                          MICKEY'S ABC'S: In this $30 IBM-compatible game from WaltDisney, preschoolers can make Mickey Mouse do various thingsby pressing letters on the keyboard. Pressing &quot;T&quot; gets Mickeyto brush his teeth, while &quot;F&quot; sends him to a fair. A similargame, Mickey's 123's, focuses on numbers. Disney also offersa $30 sound-enhancement device, called Sound Source, whichlets users hear characters' voices.                                                                                                          MCGEE SERIES: These $25 games by Lawrence Productions, forMacs and IBM-compatibles, don't purport to teach reading orhistory. But they introduce children as young as two tocomputing. By selecting pictures with a mouse, a child canfollow a preschooler called McGee as he visits a farm or goesto the fair.                                                                                                          ADDENDA: We've received many inquiries from readersseeking to contact the publishers of two computer programsmentioned in recent columns. One, a CD-ROM disk with streetmaps covering the nation, is called Street Atlas USA,published by DeLorme Mapping of Freeport, Maine. The other,Mac-to-DOS, which lets IBM-compatible computers readMacintosh disks, is by PLI (also called Peripheral Land) inFremont, Calif. In addition, we've learned of a secondprogram that lets IBM-compatible PCs read Mac disks. It'scalled Mac-in-DOS, from Pacific Micro of Mountain View,Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
