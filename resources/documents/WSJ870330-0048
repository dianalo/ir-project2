Faced with threatened legal action for alleged price-fixing and other anticompetitive practices, representatives from the West German, Italian and Greek national airlines visited the commission late last week and offered to negotiate. The other seven European airlines threatened with similar legal action already have pledged to meet commission demands to change their methods of fixing tariffs, pooling revenues and sharing routes.    The commissioners are said to be assessing whether the last-minute offers from the three airlines are adequate. A commission official said Saturday that because of the talks, &quot;there is now a possibility that instead of litigation we can begin negotiating some meaningful liberalization&quot; of air travel.    The 17-member commission has said that if the carriers didn't come to terms by early April, it would take the next step in legal proceedings that eventually would lead to a lawsuit before the European Court of Justice.    A source said that Lufthansa in particular had come under intense pressure to negotiate after other major European carriers, such as Air France, agreed to go along with the commission. &quot;No airline wants to be labeled as holding out because they can't face a competitive market,&quot; the source said. </TEXT></DOC>
