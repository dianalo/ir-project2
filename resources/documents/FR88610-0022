L. No.100-86, 101 Stat. 552. The CEBA addresses a number of important issuesrelating specifically to the thrift industry, including the recapitalizationof the FSLIC, emergency acquisitions of troubled thrift institutions, andpotential areas for improvement in the examination and supervisory processes.Among the provisions contained in the CEBA are sections 104(d) and 110,which amend section 408 of the National Housing Act (``NHA''), 12 U.S.C.1730a, by adding new subsections (p) and (t) respectively. Subsection (p)provides, in effect, that the limitations and prohibitions on transactionswith affiliates applicable to subsidiary insured institutions of savingsand loan holding companies prior to the enactment of the CEBA will notapply to transactions between a subsidiary insured institution and itsaffiliates engaged in activities permissible for a bank holding companyunder section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act (``BHCA''), 12 U.S.C.1843(c). Those transactions will, instead, be subject to the limitationsand prohibitions of sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (``FRA''),12 U.S.C. 371c and 371c-1. In addition, subsection (p) prohibits certaincross-marketing practices by an insured institution subsidiary of a diversifiedsavings and loan holding company and its affiliates. Subsection (p) furtherprovides that the Corporation may prescribe regulations for the purposeof defining and clarifying the applicability of the provisions of sections23A and 23B of the FRA.New subsection 408(t) of the NHA exempts transactions between insured institutions(and their subsidiaries) that have common ownership from the provisionsof subsection 408(d) of the NHA restricting certain transactions betweena subsidiary insured institution and its affiliates. Specifically, newsubsection 408(t) provides, in pertinent part, that ``an insured institutionthat is a subsidiary of an insured institution or insured institutionsthe voting stock of which is 80 percent owned by the same company shallnot be subject * * * to the provisions of [408(d) of the NHA] as to transactionswith such parent insured institution or affilate insured institutions (andtheir subsidiaries) * * *.'' In addition, new subsection (t) prohibitsan insured institution (or its subsidiaries) from purchasing a low qualityasset (as defined in section 23A of the FRA) from another insured institution(or its subsidiaries) in any transaction exempted by that subsection. Transactionexempted by 408(t) must be on terms and conditions that are consistentwith safe and sound financial practices.As described in greater detail below, the Board is proposing amendmentsto its regulations to (i) incorporate, with certain modifications discussedhereinafter, the provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA into proposednew 12 CFR 584.3-1 and 584.3-2 and (ii) clarify which transactions involvingsubsidiary insured institutions and their affiliates are subject to proposednew 12 CFR 584.3-1 and 584.3-2 or 12 CFR 584.3 of the Board's existingregulations. The Board is soliciting comments from interested parties onall aspects of the proposed amendments and, in particular: (i) Whetherany additional definition and clarification of the applicability of therelevant statutory and regulatory provisions is necessary, (ii) whetherand, to what extent, it is necessary or appropriate for the Board to approvetransactions that exceed the quantitative or qualitative limitations ofsection 23A incorporated into new 12 CFR 584.3-1, and (iii) whether and,the extent to which, the provisions of Part 584, including proposed andSection;andSection;584.3-1 and 584.3-2, should be applicable to transactions between a subsidiaryinsured institution and its subsidiaries and/or to transactions betweensubsidiaries of a subsidiary insured institution and other affiliates ofsuch insured institution. <ITAG tagnum="84">A. Solicitation of Comments Beyond Proposal </ITAG>The Board is concerned that the new statutory scheme, created by CEBA,to govern transactions between holding company subsidiary insured institutionsand their affiliates is somewhat confusing, frought with anomalies and,potentially inconsistent. For example, whereas section 408(d) of the NHAand 12 CFR 584.3 thereunder prohibit certain transactions and allow forprior approval, without any specified quantitative limits, by the PSA ofother transactions, section 23A of the FRA generally permits ``coveredtransactions'' up to threshold limits. Moreover, whereas 12 CFR 584.3 is(except as specifically provided therein) applicable to transactions betweena subsidiary insured institution and its service corporation subsidiariesbut is not applicable to transactions between such service corporationsand their parent institution's other holding company affiliates, the inverseis the case under section 23A of the FRA. Similarly, 12 CFR 584.3 is applicableto transactions between a subsidiary insured institution and entities outsideof the holding company structure that are under the control of a personthat controls the holding company, but section 23A is not applicable totransaction with such commonly controlled entities outside the holdingcompany structure. Accordingly, the Board is soliciting comments on whether amendments toits regulations, in addition to the amendments proposed herein, are necessaryor appropriate to provide for a workable scheme of transactions with affiliatesregulation. In light of the policies embodied in the transactions withaffiliates provisions of the CEBA of ``leveling the playing field'' betweenbank and thrift holding companies with respect to transactions betweendepository institutions and their affiliates and generally liberalizingthe restrictions on transactions between subsidiary insured institutionsand their affiliates, the Board requests commenters to address whetherit would be desirable, to the extent practicable and subject to supervisoryconsiderations, that all (or as many as possible) subsidiary insured institutionsbe subject to one set of rules with respect to transactions with theiraffiliates. Such a set of rules could, for example, be based upon the limitationsand prohibitions contained in sections 23A and 23B of the FRA. Accordingly,the Board seeks public comments on whether and, to what extent, the Board'sregulations at 12 CFR 584.3 could or should subject transactions betweena subsidiary insured institution and its affiliates to prohibitions andlimitations based on those contained in sections 23A and 23B of the FRAwithout transgressing the requirements of section 408(d) of the NHA. It should also be noted that the Board has proposed for comment amendmentsto 12 CFR 563.41(a) and 12 CFR 563.43(a) (the ``Conflict Rules'') to removeany potential for conflict between those regulatory provisions and section408(d)(6) of the NHA, 12 U.S.C. 1730(d)(6), which requires the prior approvalof the FSLIC on a case-by-case basis of certain transactions between aninsured institution and its affiliates.\1\<NOTE/> The effect of those proposed amendments would be to makethe Conflict Rules inapplicable to transactions with affiliates that arealready subject to transactions with affiliates regulation pursuant toprovisions of the NHA. Transactions between an insured institution thatis not a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company and affiliatedpersons of that insured institution (as defined by 12 CFR 561.29) wouldcontinue to be subject to the Conflicts Rules. The Board may also reviewthe Conflict Rules to determine what, if any, additional amendments tothose provisions are warranted. Once such review is completed the Boardwill, if warranted, solicit public comment on proposed amendments to theConflicts Rules. At this time, the Board is not specifically solicitingcomment with respect to the Conflict Rules. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ See Bd. Res. No. 88-287, 52 FR 15230 (April 28, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Amendments to Part 584  </ITAG>In accordance with section 408 of the NHA, as amended by the CEBA, theBoard is proposing to amend Part 584 of its regulations to provide thattransactions between an insured institution subsidiary of a savings andloan holding company and an affiliate of the insured institution, whichis engaged only in business activities which the Board of Governors ofthe Federal Reserve System (``FRB''), by regulation or order has determinedto be permissible for bank holding companies under section 4(c)(8) of theBHCA, are subject to the provisions of sections 23A and 23B of the FRA,as implemented in proposed new 12 CFR 584.3-1 and 584.3-2. Transactionsbetween an insured institution subsidiary of a savings and loan holdingcompany and its affiliates that are engaged in business activities thatthe FRB has not determined to be permissible for bank holding companies,or that the Board has determined, by regulation, to not be a permissiblenonbanking activity for savings and loan holding companies, will continueto be subject to the provisions of 12 CFR 584.3.\2\<NOTE/> In addition, the Board proposes to incorporate the exemptionfrom subsection 408(d) of the NHA provided by new subsection 408(t) ofthe NHA into Part 584.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ See, Board Res. No. 87-1299, 53 FR 312 (January 6, 1988)in which the Board adopted amendments to its regulations to, among otherthings, revise 12 CFR 584.2-2 regarding permissible nonbanking activitiesof savings and loan holding companies.  Specifically, the Board proposes to (i) amend paragraph (a) of 12 CFR 584.3to exempt transactions between an insured institution subsidiary of a savingsand loan holding company and its affiliates engaged only in permissiblesavings and loan holding company nonbanking activities (``permissible nonbankingactivities'') form the provisions of that regulation, (ii) add new paragraph(i) to 12 CFR 584.3 to exempt transactions between an insured institutionthat is a subsidiary of another insured institution or insured institutionsthat are at least 80 percent owned by the same holding company and suchparent or affiliate insured institutions (and each other's subsidiaries)from the provisions of that section, (iii) add new 12 CFR 584.3-1, whichexplicitly applies to transactions between an insured institution subsidiaryof a savings and loan holding company and its affiliates engaged only inpermissible nonbanking activities and incorporates, with certain modifications,the terms and provisions of Section 23A of the FRA into the Board's regulations,and (iv) add new 12 CFR 584.3-2, which explicitly applies to transactionsbetween an insured institution subsidiary of a savings and loan holdingcompany and its affiliates engaged only in permissible nonbanking activitiesand incorporates, with certain modifications, the terms and provisionsof Section 23B of the FRA into the Board's regulations.  New andSection; 584.3(i) incorporates the exemption from the otherwise applicablerestrictions on affiliated transactions provided by new subsection 408(t)of the NHA. Pursuant to new andSection; 584.3(i), transactions between (i)a subsidiary insured institution and its parent insured institution (andsuch parent's subsidiaries) and (ii) insured institutions (and each other'ssubsidiaries) that are at least 80 percent owned by the same holding companyare exempt from the provisions of 12 CFR 584.3. Such transactions will,however, depending upon the types of activities engaged in, be subjectto the provisions of proposed new 12 CFR 584.3-1 and 584.3-2.\3\<NOTE/> Thus, the exemption provided by new andSection; 584.3(i) willbe applicable only when both of the insured institutions involved in aspecific transaction, directly or through a subsidiary, are (i) in a parent/subsidiaryrelationship or (ii) are subject to at least 80 percent common ownership. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Generally, transactions directly between insured institutionswith the requisite relationship will be exempted from the provisions ofproposed 12 CFR 584.3-1. See proposed 12 CFR 584.3-1(e).The Board wishes to note that transactions between a subsidiary insuredinstitution and its own service corporation subsidiaries are not explicitlycovered by new subsection 408(t) of the NHA. Accordingly, the Board isconsidering whether it is appropriate to continue to apply 12 CFR 584.3to transactions between subsidiary insured institutions and their own servicecorporation subsidiaries that are not exclusively engaged in permissiblenonbanking activities and, as discussed in greater detail below, the Boardspecifically solicits comments on that issue.New 12 CFR 584.3-1 tracks the terms and provisions of section 23A of theFRA with modifications designed to clarify the applicability of such termsand provisions to insured institutions. The new regulations defines ``coveredtransactions'' and limits an insured institution's cumulative covered transactionswith any one affiliate to no more than 10 percent of the institution'sregulatory capital (as defined in 12 CFR 561.13) and with all affiliates,that are engaged exclusively in permissible nonbanking activities, in theaggregate to no more than 20 percent of the institution's regulatory capital.In order to provide for operating flexibility, the regulation delegatesauthority to an insured institution's Principal Supervisory Agent (``PSA'')(as defined in 12 CFR 561.35) to approve covered transactions in excessof the quantative thresholds, provided that the PSA determines that thetransaction would not be detrimental to the interests of the savings accountholders of the specific insured institution or to the insurance risk ofthe Corporation with respect to that institution. The Board specificallyseeks comment as to the appropriateness of the proposed delegation andwhether the PSA approval mechanism also should be available with respectto qualitative criteria contained in section 23A. The Board also specificallyrequests comments on what recordkeeping requirements would be appropriatefor insured institutions to document transactions with affiliates thatdo not require a specific approval and whether the Board should provideparticularized, explicit authority for its supervisory agents to unwindtransactions with affiliates that, after review by an examiner and appropriatesupervisory staff, are deemed to be unsafe and unsound.Proposed new 12 CFR 584.3-1(e) lists the exemptions from the provisionsof the new regulation. In this regard, the Board specifically requestscomment as to whether the exemption, in proposed 12 CFR 584.3-1(e)(2),for giving immediate credit to an affiliate for uncollected items receivedin the ordinary course of business may expose an insured institution toundue risk and whether any limitations should be imposed on such extensionsof credit.The definition of affiliate contained in proposed new 12 CFR 584.3-1 modifiesthe definition of that term in section 23A of the FRA by including as affiliatesthose subsidiaries of a subsidiary insured institution that are engagedin activities that the insured institution would not be authorized to engagein directly. The proposed definition of affiliate would, in effect, generallyremove, subject to safety and soundness considerations, the regulatoryprohibitions and limitations on transactions between a subsidiary insuredinstitution and its subsidiaries that are exclusively engaged in permissiblenonbanking activities and are not engaged in any activities that the insuredinstitution would not be authorized to engage in directly. Such proposeddefinition of affiliate would, however, subject transactions between aservice corporation subsidiary and its parent institution's other holdingcompany affiliates to the regulatory prohibitions and limitation containedin proposed 12 CFR 584.3-1 and 584.3-2. The Board is aware that applicationof the definition of affiliate as contained in proposed 12 CFR 584.3-1would mark a departure from current practice in the thrift industry wherebytransactions between a service corporation subsidiary and its parent institution'sother holding company affiliates are not subject to the provisions of 12CFR 584.3. It would, on the other hand, create an additional option forsavings and loans that is presently available to insured banks under sections23A and 23B in the form of the ``operating subsidiary'', and it would furtherCEBA's mandate to ``level the playing field'' between bank and thrift holdingcompanies.The Board is concerned that utilization of two divergent difinitions ofthe term ``affiliate'' will lead to confusion in the thrift industry. Accordingly,as previously noted, the Board is soliciting comments as to the most appropriatemanner, under Part 584, to treat (i) transactions between a subsidiaryinsured institution and its subsidiaries; (ii) transactions between subsidiariesof a subsidiary insured institution and other holding company affiliatesof such insured institution; and (iii) transaction between a subsidiaryinsured institution and affiliates that are not subsidiaries of the holdingcompany. More specifically, the Board solicits comments on the followingquestions:(i) Whether and to what extent, transactions between a subsidiary insuredinstitution and its subsidiaries should be subject to any regulatory restrictions?\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In this regard the Board notes that, although 12 CFR 583.15includes a service corporation subsidiary of a subsidiary insured institutionwithin the definition of ``affiliate'' for purposes of the transactionswith affiliates provisions of 12 CFR 584.3, a service corporation subsidiaryof an insured institution that is not part of a holding company structure(a ``stand alone institution'') is not included in the definition of ``affiliatedperson'' contained in 12 CFR 561.29 and, therefore, transactions betweensuch stand alone institution and its service corporations would not besubject to comparable transactions with affiliates regulation.(ii) Whether and to what extent, transactions between subsidiaries of asubsidiary insured institution and other holding company affiliates ofsuch insured institution should be subject to any regulatory restrictions?(iii) Whether it is appropriate, for simplicity and uniformity reasons,to treat subsidiaries of subsidiary insured institutions as affiliatesin all cases for purposes of Part 584? and;(iv) Whether and to what extent, distinctions can and should be made betweenthe treatment of affiliates that are holding company subsidiaries and otherentities that are currently treated as affiliates, e.g., companies controlledby a natural person that is a controlling person of the holding company?Proposed new andSection; 584.3-1 requires all covered and exempt transactionsbetween a subsidiary insured institution and its affiliates to be on termsand conditions consistent with safe and sound thrift practices and prohibitsan insured institution from purchasing ``low-quality'' assets (as definedtherein) from an affiliate. Finally, the regulation requires that all ofa subsidiary insured institution's extensions of credit to an affiliatemust be secured by collateral in specified amounts.New 12 CFR 584.3-2 tracks, with minor modifications (e.g., the term ``insuredinstitution'' is substituted for ``member bank'' throughout the regulation),the terms and provisions of Section 23B of the FRA. The new regulationprovides that a subsidiary insured institution may engage in certain transactionswith an affiliate of the insured institution only if the terms and conditionsof the transaction are substantially the same, or at least as favorableto the insured institution, as those prevailing at the time for comparbletransactions with nonaffiliated companies. In the absence of comparabletransactions, the regulation requires the terms and conditions of the transactionto be the same as those that, in good faith, would be offered to or wouldapply to nonaffiliatied companies. In addition, an advertising restrictionis imposed on insured institutions, their subsidiaries, and affiliateswith respect to advertisements stating or suggesting that the insured institutionshall in any way be responsible for the obligations of its affiliates.The Board intends new Sections 584.3-1 and 584.3-2 to apply to transactionsbetween a subsidiary insured institution and those of its affiliates thatare exclusively engaged in permissible nonbanking activities. That an affiliateis engaged in more than one permissible nonbanking activity will not affectthe applicability of the new provisions provided the affiliate is engagedonly in permissible nonbanking activities. In general, new andSection;andSection;584.3-1 and 584.3-2 represent a liberalization, dictated by the CEBA, ofthe transactions with affiliates restrictions applicable to insured institutionsand those of their affiliates that are engaged only in permissible nonbankingactivities. The new regulations contain their own set of defined termsincluding: ``Covered transaction,'' ``control,'' ``subsidiary,'' ``securities,''``low-quality asset,'' and ``permissible nonbanking activity.'' The proposednew regulation would define the term ``insured institution'' to have thesame meaning as given that term under 12 CFR 583.6.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis.1. <T3>Reasons, objectives and legal basis underlying the proposed rule. </T3>Theseelements are incorporate above in the <T4>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T4> regarding the proposal.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply. </T3>The proposedrule would apply to all insured institutions.3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities. </T3>The proposed rulewould not have a substantial impact on small insured institutions.4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting federal rules.</T3> There are no known rulesthat duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this proposal. 5. <T3>Alternative to the proposed rule.</T3> There are no alternatives thatwould be less burdensome than the proposal in addressing the concerns expressedin the <T4>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T4> set forth above. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 584 </ITAG>Holding Companies, Savings and loan association, Securities.
