<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-0362 </DOCNO><TEXT>Over the past several decades, significant progress has been made in measuringand understanding the global carbon cycle and in developing methods forprojecting future changes in the atmospheric CO{sub 2} concentration.During this time, a natural starting point was to check the balance sheetthat accounts for all carbon as it exchanged between the major globalcarbon reservoirs. While it is possible to achieve a balance for a singleinstant in time, it is not possible with current information to balancecarbon fluxes for decade or longer time periods. The inability to accountfor all carbon exchanges indicated an insufficient knowledge of globalcarbon cycle processes. In this paper, I outline the scale of the discrepanciesinvolved and offer hypotheses concerning previously underappreciatedcarbon fluxes that suggest new research directions. These hypothesespostulate global vegetation change at several time scales as a plausiblereason for our inability to ``balance'' the global carbon cycle overlong time periods. 47 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
