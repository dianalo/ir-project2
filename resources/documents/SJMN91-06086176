But it is uncertain that Monday'smeasure will make happy those made angry by the first resolution.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  S.F. SUPERVISORS BACK BOTH FIGHTERS AND PACIFISTSIN WAR PLAY BOTH SIDES OF WAR ISSUE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     More likely, it will make them confused.;    One paragraph of theresolution praises &quot;the courage and sacrifice of those who served in thePersian Gulf War . . . and their willingness to put the call of duty abovetheir personal needs and comforts.&quot;;    Then, a few paragraphs later, itreaffirms the standing of the city as a sanctuary &quot;for all persons who formoral, ethical or religious reasons could not participate in war.&quot;;    MayorArt Agnos saw no conflict in expressing support for both factions.;    &quot;Inshort, this resolution supersedes the previous resolution by taking the placeof the previous resolution now that the war is over,&quot; he said in a letter tothe supervisors urging their approval. &quot;It is a logical conclusion to theprocess.&quot;;    But to some critics of the city's sanctuary proclamation,including Fremont Mayor Bill Ball, who recently questioned San Francisco'scredentials for staging a welcome-home parade, the real message conveyed byMonday's resolution is one of pure political expediency.;    &quot;You either do oryou don't,&quot; Ball said. &quot;I would have just left it alone.&quot;;    Approval of theresolution followed a two-hour hearing by the board's economic and socialpolicy committee earlier in the day. About 100 people attended, and those whospoke were nearly evenly divided in their recommendations.;    Former PoliceChief Frank Jordan, a candidate for mayor who wanted the sanctuary resolutionrescinded, told the committee it had made San Francisco &quot;the laughingstock ofthe nation.&quot; But George Wesolek, a spokesman for the Roman CatholicArchdiocese of San Francisco, told the panel that conscientious objectors also&quot;deserve our support.&quot;;    Supervisor Bill Maher, who abstained from theunanimous vote on the sanctuary resolution in January, urged his colleagues torescind it and not take positions on international issues in the future.;   &quot;I don't know why we have a foreign policy,&quot; Maher said. &quot;It makes us looksilly.&quot;;    Supervisor Harry Britt disagreed. He urged the board to stick toits guns in defense of those who had put theirs down. To rescind the offer ofsanctuary would show cowardice in the face of shifting political winds, hesaid.;    Maher's motion to rescind the sanctuary resolution lost 7-4. Theresolution in support of everyone passed 7-4.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL DORGAN, Mercury News San Francisco Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910326  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  457  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 26, 199100086176,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
