SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The commander of the U.S. and allied forces inEurope, Gen. John Galvin, said Thursday that budget pressures forcethe nation's military chiefs to haggle over Pentagon spending indiscussions that resemble Aztec ``bloodletting ceremonies.''   Galvin, who is the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and thecommander-in-chief of the U.S. European Command, spoke of theinternal negotiations that go on among the nation's highestmilitary leaders as they grapple with budget cuts.   For the past five years, the Pentagon has had to deal withdeclining funds.   The four-star general was asked at a meeting with reporters toaddress the issue that dwindling budget resources means thePentagon ``can't have everything'' it wants and may be forced tocut entire weapons systems.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, currently embroiled in budgetdiscussions with Capitol Hill lawmakers over the Pentagon's $295billion budget, has attempted to cut programs such as the V-22Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the F-14D jet fighter, but has metstiff opposition.   Galvin said it is clear, that given budget pressures, thenation's military will be pared down.   ``Everybody is looking at this ...it's a big thing for us. Weface an austere future,'' Galvin said. ``At the same time ... weare responsible for deterrence and defense, and so how are we goingto do this? How are we going to draw up these priority lists?''   The four-star general said he is taking part in Pentagonsessions over the next two days where ``a lot of that is beingdiscussed.''   ``Those are kind of bloodletting ceremonies, like the Aztecs. Weget up on top of the pyramid and try to work it out,'' Galvin said.   Told that such ceremonies included trying to ``pull the otherguy's heart out,'' Galvin, with a smile, shot back, ``That's whatI'm talking about. This is hard work, and hard negotiating amongservice chiefs.''   The general, who elicited a hearty round of laughter from thereporters with his remarks, hastily added that such negotiationsare ``really done in a good spirit.''   The general said he did not want to give the impression that themilitary chiefs are ``only looking out as far as the end of mynose,'' and ``don't care what is happening the day after tomorrow.''   He said that in order to respond to the changes that aresweeping the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, as well as theongoing arms control negotiations, the U.S. military chiefs are``doing a lot of thinking'' and are trying ``to draw closer andcloser together on ... If you can't have it all, what do you giveup?''   Galvin said that such infighting among the service chiefs``always goes on, but as you get into more austerity, it getsworse.''</TEXT></DOC>
