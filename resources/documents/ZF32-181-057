(Product development).andO;Product:   PSI/Origen (Network management software) (Product development)PSI/LanStandard (Network management software) (Productdevelopment).andO;Topic:     Product DevelopmentSoftware PublishersNetwork Management Software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A pair of software packages that profees to solve common networking problemsby automating manual installation, management and maintenance tasks has beendeveloped by Preferred Systems (Wilson, Conn.).andM;The company said that the two packages, PSI/Origen and PSI/LanStandard, arethe industry's first &quot;network automation&quot; products.andP;  It projected that themarket for such systems could reach $500 million by 1993.andM;Network automation, said Mark Freund, CEO of the Interconnect NetworkConsulting Group, &quot;allows a company to pull together 10 or 100 moreindependent networks in a cohesive, logical internetwork, resulting in amanageable set of LAN resources throughout the enterprise.&quot;andM;Preferred Systems, which branched off from Preferred Health Care last year,said that network automation systems enable corporations to more quicklydownsize their information systems and build distributed processingenvironments.andM;The first releases of the products are designed for Novell's NetWare 3.11,but according to Jack Serfass, president of Preferred Systems, versions forLAN Manager and UNIX &quot;are on the drawing board.&quot;andM;Preferred Systems has already attained Novell Certified Developer status.andM;Depending upon circumstances, Serfass claimed that Origen and LanStandard arecapable of configuring a LAN in 45 minutes to two hours; generating fileservers in under one hour, and eliminating the 30- to 40-step installationand configuration process generally undertaken by network administrators.andM;He explained that the two packages are complementary: Origen, shipping now,configures new file servers, while the more elaborate LanStandard, to shiplater this year, is designed for managing and configurating existing fileservers.andM;&quot;The power of [Origen and LanStandard] is betweeen platforms andheterogeneous operating systems,&quot; noted Serfass.andP;  &quot;Ideally, it's a singlekeystroke or a set of keystrokes that grant functionality over a network.&quot;andM;Serfass said the packages &quot;will allow you to configure communicationssoftware,&quot; and &quot;to import and export configuration standards between fileservers.&quot;andM;The packages, which have an SAA-compliant interface, allow global configuringand reconfiguring of LAN-to-host communications software, including gatewaysto hosts from IBM (AS/400s and 3090s), Digital, Hewlett-Packard, and otherTCP/IP-based machines.andM;A recent Clarke-Burton News Analysis said that, &quot;Products like Origen andLanStandard are going to appeal to system integrators and network managerswho are responsible for implementing and managing LANs with hundreds of usersand large numbers of file servers.&quot;andM;The report concluded that &quot;This type of product can clearly be an importantpart of the solution to the complexity crisis.&quot;andM;&quot;This is a tremendous opportunity for large corporations who have entered the1990s struggling to get their arms around their LANs,&quot; remarked Freund.andP;  &quot;Thenew generation of networks for the 1990s will consist of intricate webs ofinternetworked LANs as opposed to the fragmented departmentally-oriented LANsof the 1980s.&quot;andM;Serfass said that Origen will be priced at $595 per server and LAN Standardwill be $1,495 per server.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
