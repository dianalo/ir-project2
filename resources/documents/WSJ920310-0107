Workers staying on after the latest &quot;downsizing&quot; wavesuffer guilt that friends were cut, and they worry about howthey will fare themselves, according to a Penn StateUniversity researcher's survey of 597 clerks and managers ata retail-store chain. Facing rumors that more layoffs willfollow ones early this year, Steelcase urges employees tovoice their concerns to bosses.</LP><TEXT>   General Motors reiterates that most of its 74,000 job cutswill result from &quot;regular and accelerated attrition.&quot; Workersare now aware that GM has to be more competitive, but alsothat retraining and counseling support is available, aspokesman says. Eastland Financial, Woonsocket, R.I., and LTXCorp., Westwood, Mass., try to imbue remaining employees witha spirit of pulling together.   Morale, at its lowest just before layoff announcements,improves once the word comes, Rogers Corp., EastlandFinancial and Houston Lighting andamp; Power say.                                                                                                          SALARY INCREASES this year will be smaller than planned.   A survey of 718 employers by Coopers andamp; Lybrand shows that1992 salaries will rise an average 4.8% to 4.9%, down 0.3point from last summer's expectations. Last year, increasesaveraged 5.2% to 5.4%. After a lackluster 1991 fourthquarter, more firms had to &quot;bite the bullet,&quot; so mostemployees will get the smallest salary increases in more than20 years, Coopers andamp; Lybrand says.   Executive salaries will rise an average 5.1%, less thanthe originally planned 5.5% and last year's actual 5.7% rise.Of the polled companies, 10% have pay freezes this year,compared with 11% last year. Nearly all the companies withfreezes in 1991 expected them to thaw this year, buttwo-thirds ended up extending them.                                                                                                          HAVE A GOOD TIME: Fun is often serious corporate business.   Fun remains an important part of many firms' culture,recession or not. &quot;In difficult economic times, it is evenmore important,&quot; a spokesman for Cadence Design Systems says.After finishing a recent merger, the company held a rally atthe San Jose, Calif., civic auditorium, where employeesassembled a 16-by-20-foot puzzle. Then they went to a bar andplayed basketball.   Each April Fool's Day, engineers at Sun Microsystems pulla prank on senior executives. Last year, they took apart anexec's office and reassembled it in an aquarium shark tank inGolden State Park. Wayne, the exec, donned a wet suit andjumped in the tank. W.L. Gore andamp; Associates, a Delaware firm,aims &quot;to make money and have fun,&quot; a spokeswoman says.Following or mixing business with pleasure, Gore employeesplay volleyball, throw water balloons, have a crab feast orplay &quot;What's My Line.&quot;   When asked about fun in the workplace, a Toys &quot;R&quot; Usspokesman says, &quot;We have no substantial input at this time.&quot;                                                                                                          JANITORS POLISH OFF a dispute with Shine BuildingMaintenance, an Apple Computer contractor, ending a year-longbattle. The 120 janitors voted for Service Employees unionrepresentation, and the union will drop wage-and-hour andsexual harassment charges. Hewlett-Packard's janitorialcontractor will be a target of the union.                                                                                                          COOLING-OFF PERIODS begin in railroad union negotiationsinvolving Amtrak, Conrail and about 40 freight railroads.That means no strike can occur for 30 days. The partiesrejected arbitration offers by the National Mediation Board.                                                                                                          A WHEELCHAIR-USING sports reporter for Oklahoma State'sDaily O'Collegian says she accepts the University ofMissouri's apology for dubbing her a &quot;fire hazard&quot; andforcing her to leave the courtside press table at abasketball game. She was moved to an aisle behind 15 rows ofspectators.                                                                                                          A BAD PRECEDENT? That's how some view the proposedcoal-industry tax.   Asking the whole industry to cover retiree health-benefitobligations of a few companies, and planning no steps tocontain costs for existing retirees and widows, would send awrong message on health-cost issues, argues Richard Sawaya, alobbyist for Arco Coal, one of the nonunion firms that opposethe plan. The Senate Finance Committee has adopted theproposal, which was sponsored by Sen. Rockefeller (D.,W.Va.), and backed by the United Mine Workers and unionizedmines.   Some 83% of the coal retirees have Medicare coverage, andothers will have it at age 65, says Labor Secretary LynnMartin, calling the plan &quot;a dangerous precedent.&quot; Medicareworks for a lot of people outside coal, Mr. Sawaya says. ButMedicare doesn't cover full health bills and costlyprescription drugs, among other things, the plan's backerssay. They say a special, 45-year-old government promise toall coal retirees is at stake.   Since the coal industry is required to pay to reclaimabandoned mine lands, it &quot;can pay to take care of abandonedpeople,&quot; Sen. Rockefeller says.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: A study for the Connecticut state policeconcludes that officers should stop using hand-held radarguns, pending more research on their health effects. . . .Unable to find a willing Postmaster General candidate, thePostal Board of Governors puts search firm Korn/FerryInternational on the case. . . . A Gallup poll of 1,170members of National Small Business United, a tradeassociation, shows that 28% treat their staff to lunch atleast once a month.</TEXT></DOC>
