After a four-year slide, bonuses doled out by securitiesfirms to investment bankers will be up an average of 25% thisyear, reflecting Wall Street's banner earnings, according toWall Street executives and executive recruiters. The jumpfollows a depressed 1990, when bonuses for investment bankers-- who hold some of the Street's most coveted jobs -- fell anaverage 40% from 1989 levels.</LP><TEXT>   Wall Street investment bankers count on bonuses for thebulk of their annual pay. The recent jump means that seniorinvestment bankers who had a salary of $150,000 and bonus of,say, $700,000 last year, will get slightly more than $1million this year.   Junior bankers will have to content themselves with less.The average pay levels for investment bankers with threeyears' experience at major securities firms will be between$175,000 and $275,000, including bonuses, according to WallStreet executives. And some junior bankers will take home farmore.   The bulging pay envelopes reflect Wall Street's recordyear for underwriting new stock and bond issues, which morethan made up for a continued slump in corporate mergers. Forthe first time in four years, securities firms have had threeconsecutive blockbuster quarters, with pretax profits ofnearly $4 billion through September.   But this year's fatter bonuses are also a function of howfar bonuses had sunk since the 1987 stock-market crash; WallStreet executives say bonuses are back to 1988 and 1989levels, but nowhere near the glory years of 1986 and 1987.   &quot;It's not euphoria,&quot; said Gary Goldstein, president ofWhitney Group, a New York executive search firm. &quot;But I thinkthere's guarded optimism because of the heavy {business}backlog into 1992.&quot;   Despite the average-bonus gains this year, there will be abigger discrepancy than in past years between the bonuses oftop producers and their less-productive counterparts. Someinvestment bankers in such red-hot areas as derivativesproducts, for instance, could see their bonuses jump anaverage of 40% or more from year-earlier levels.   &quot;The discrepancies, which we began to see last year, havebecome extreme,&quot; said Joan Zimmerman, executive vicepresident at G.Z. Stephens Inc., a New York executive searchfirm.   Said an investment banking chief at a big Wall Streetfirm: &quot;The stars have got to be paid; the remainder takewhat's left.&quot;   Not all firms have handed out higher bonuses, however.Investment bankers at Salomon Brothers Inc., for instance,will see average bonuses slashed about 25% from last year'slevel. That's largely because of the cost-cutting efforts ofInterim Chairman Warren Buffett, who in October took back$110 million that had earlier been slated for bonuses. Thiswas one of the steps taken by Mr. Buffett in the wake ofSalomon's Treasury-auction bidding scandal.   At a meeting last week, Salomon Chief Operating OfficerDeryck Maughan told employees that 70% of the firm's managingdirectors will have their bonuses slashed from last year.Most Salomon employees will receive their bonuses Dec. 20.   &quot;Guys making a million last year will be making about$750,000 this year,&quot; a senior Salomon executive saidyesterday. In 1990, 106 Salomon Brothers employees each made$1 million or more.   Many securities firms will be handing out bonus envelopesin the next several weeks. The bonus pools for investmentbankers at Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. andShearson Lehman Brothers Inc., an American Express Co. unit,are expected to be up an average of 25% from a year ago,people close to each of the firms said. Bankers at Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc., a unit of Equitable Life AssuranceSociety of the U.S., will see bonuses up an average 30%.   At PaineWebber Group Inc., banker bonuses will jump asmuch as 25% -- reflecting the firm's 1991 profit turnaround-- but, for the second consecutive year, will be paid partlyin PaineWebber stock. It's expected that the &quot;paper&quot; portionof the bonuses will account for 10% to 20% of the total.   Indeed, many securities firms continue to require staffersto take less of their bonuses in cash. Instead, a significantpart of their pay is in the form of their firm's stock, or inother incentives tied to the firm's performance. Salomon,PaineWebber, Shearson and Merrill, among others, have takenthis tack in recent years.   Many bankers would prefer getting all-cash bonuses. But aPaineWebber official says the partial-stock awards givesemployees &quot;a sense of ownership and promotes long-termthinking, and over a long period, we believe, will lockpeople in.&quot; (PaineWebber's share price has already doubledthis year amid a rally in brokerage-firm stocks.)   At Merrill, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, the stockportion of bankers' bonuses will range from 10% to 30%, evenup to 50% in some cases. Herb Allison, chief financialofficer, says: &quot;It's important for our employees and thepublic to understand that bonuses relate to teamwork&quot; and thefirm's profitability, and so &quot;final determinations of bonusamounts&quot; won't be made until the end of the year.   One exception to this pay trend is First Boston Corp.Executives at the CS First Boston Inc. unit expect that,unlike last year, most of their bonuses this year will be incash.</TEXT></DOC>
