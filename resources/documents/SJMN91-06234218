All my stuff's in storage. I'm ready toleave, but I have nowhere to go.&quot;;   This Saturday, the University ofCalifornia was planning to send 33 students -- including eight from UC-SantaCruz and four from UC-Berkeley -- to Leningrad to study at the Herzen RussianState Pedagogical University. UC will decide today whether to cancel the trip-- though it would disappoint students who had to study the Russian languagefor two years to qualify for the program.;   If the trip is canceled, Berkeleystudents would face an added hardship as they scramble for classes, whichbegin Monday. And students at the other campuses -- where classes start Sept.30 -- would suddenly have to look for housing, which is always scarce.;   TheUC students spent Monday and Tuesday in front of televisions, hoping for anend to the Soviet upheaval.;   &quot;I'd still like to go,&quot; said Anysia Henry, 20,a UC-Davis international relations student. &quot;Maybe we should. I don't feelthere's that much danger to Americans there right now.&quot;;   For Ahern, apolitical science major, the Leningrad program would cap his undergraduatecareer; he needs only two more units. He said he would not return to Berkeleybecause gaining credits would cause him to graduate -- and thus miss futurechances to study in the Soviet Union.;   &quot;It's more important to me to go toLeningrad than graduate,&quot; he said. &quot;If I don't go this time, maybe I'll gonext spring, or next year or two years from now.&quot;;   Ahern's apartment floor,like that of other students, was piled Tuesday with supplies he bought for thetrip: warm clothing, six months' worth of contact lens solution, toilet paper,soap and a special water pump that filters infectious bacteria out of runningwater.;   John Marcum, the director of UC's Education Abroad Program, saidofficials will cancel the program if the university cannot assure studentsafety.;   &quot;We're told things are calm in Leningrad, but there are conflictingreports,&quot; he said.;   At San Jose State, officials were worried about the sixstudents they were to enroll this fall from the Moscow Institute ofLinguistics.;   &quot;We're just a little concerned about how these students feelat this point and how they are going to get here,&quot; said M. Lou Lewandowski,dean of graduate and international studies. &quot;We're wondering if they're goingto be here at all.&quot;;   A disappointed Maxwell, a Russian studies studenthoping to study in Leningrad next year, bemoaned the possible loss of thecultural exchange.;   &quot;We were going to have them as part of ourextracurricular activities, showing them around and talking to them. Now itdoesn't look like it will happen.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RENEE KOURY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910821  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  577  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, August 21, 199100234218,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
