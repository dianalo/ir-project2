 Hundreds of developersnow sell annual support contracts, and new ideas about support-based servicepackages are beginning to get serious attention among company strategists.andM;The driving force behind many of these changes is the fact that tech supportmore than ever looks like a financial sinkhole for the entire industry.andO;Hiring new technicians and installing extra telephone lines adds new costswithout adding new revenues.andP;  Worse, improvements in the quality of supportoften seem to attract additional callers with questions that have little todo with a company's own product line.andP;  Developers often report that more thantwo-thirds of their calls come from people with questions about operatingsystems, hardware setup, or compatibility problems created by other products.andO;As the software and hardware environment becomes increasingly complex, thisparticular sinkhole is bound to grow deeper.andM;Yet at the same time, tech support also looks increasingly attractive as away to build closer ties with customers.andP;  WordPerfect is the classic exampleof a company that aggressively promoted an open-ended, highly responsivesupport program as a reason to become a WordPerfect customer.andP;  That policygave WordPerfect a distinct edge in dealing with competitors--especiallyMicroPro--whose support departments were chronically understaffed andunresponsive.andP;  In the long run, support managers argue, their departments mayturn out to be a significant profit center after all.andM;Despite this ongoing debate over support services, however, there has beenremarkably little concrete information about industry practices and operatingstatistics.andP;  Typically, research on tech support has focused on the concernsof end-users and mainframe software vendors; the industry's shared experienceis largely anecdotal and based on skimpy data.andM;For this reason, we decided to take a thorough look at technical supportoperations.andP;  Like our other Benchmark surveys, this research report isdesigned to supply practical guidelines for companies of all sizes, in verydiverse markets.andP;  In developing the survey, we polled a cross-section ofsupport managers and company executives to get a sense of which topics weneeded to survey, then sent a detailed questionnaire to our subscriber listand to our database of micro-based software companies.andP;  By the January 30cutoff date, we had received usable data from 282 companies--a response levelthat clearly provides a good deal of statistical depth.andP;  (As usual, we didn'taccept anonymous survey responses, though the actual names of all respondentsare confidential.)andM;In addition to questions about technical support, our survey questionnaireincluded several demographic questions about company size, developmentplatform, size of installed base, etc.andP;  that we used to define importantsubgroups within the total survey sample.andP;  The demographics of our sample areclose to the overall industry profile we've derived from other Benchmarkstudies:andM;* Company size.andP;  256 of the 282 companies in our survey sample provided uswith data about sales levels.andP;  Of this group, 42% report annual sales of lessthan $1 million, 33% have sales in the $1-$5 million range, 8% fall in the$5-$10 million range, and 17% are above $10 million in sales.andP;  (Foranalytical purposes, we treat the two middle groups as a single category.)andM;* Development platform.andP;  Predictably, DOS shows up as the most popularplatform among our survey respondents, with 233 companies that develop titlesfor DOS machines.andP;  The Mac follows with 96; Unix, 46; OS/2, 43; Apple II, 39;Atari and Amiga, 20 each.andP;  The sample also suggests that multi-platformdevelopment strategies have become increasingly widespread; relatively fewcompanies indicate that they support only a single platform.andM;* Installed base.andP;  Because support obligations often extend indefinitely, thesize of the installed base has some impact on total support costs.andP;  Themedian installed base for our sample is a relatively modest 12,000 copies;the 50% range extends from 2,000 copies to 80,000.andP;  Typically, the installedbase represents more than one title.andP;  Only 10% of our respondents market asingle title; 46% support two to six titles; 28% support seven to 20 titles;13%, 21 to 100; and 4%, more than 100.andM;* Flagship product.andP;  Most of our tech support survey data measurescompany-wide support policies and activity levels, not single-title activity.andO;However, we did collect some basic data on each company's &quot;most populartitle,&quot; which sometimes helped us spot correlations based on product pricesor market segments.andP;  We find, for example, that the median price for the&quot;most popular&quot; products in our sample is $299 (50% range, $99.95-$795), andthe median installed base is 6,000 copies (50% range, 1,275-28,000 copies).andO;The size of the &quot;most popular&quot; installed base suggests that the typicalflagship title represents about half of a company's total installed base).andM;In terms of product categories, the flagship titles in the survey aredominated by business applications and vertical market titles.andP;  Ranked byfrequency of response, the distribution looks like this:andM;As we've noted in earlier Benchmark surveys, there are so many possible waysto analyze and present this kind of survey data that we've had to narrow ourfocus to provide views that will have the broadest application to mainstreamcompanies.andM;But we also recognize that many readers may want to explore narrower slicesof our database.andP;  So we've assembled the raw data from our questionnaires(excluding company names) in spreadsheet form.andP;  Copies of this spreadsheetcan be ordered from Soft.letter for $25 prepaid.andP;  Available disk formatsinclude Lotus 1-2-3 (PC 5.25&quot; and 3.5&quot;) and Excel (Mac, PC 5.25&quot; and PC3.5&quot;).andM;FINANCIAL RATIOSandM;We asked respondents how much they spend on &quot;total support costs&quot; as apercentage of their net sales.andP;  The median came out about where we expected,at 6% of sales.andP;  However, a more interesting point emerges when we comparecompanies that support DOS, Mac, and Unix platforms.andP;  The popular assumptionis that Mac software imposes a significantly lower support burden, especiallyin comparison with a less-friendly environment like Unix.andP;  In reality,support overhead doesn't seem to differ much from one platform to another.andM;We also asked our respondents how they allocated support costs within theirinternal budget categories.andP;  Here, the lack of consistency is dramatic: 30%or our sample allocate support to marketing and sales, 29% allocate it toGandamp;A, 15% to cost of goods, 12% to Randamp;D, and 14% to &quot;other.&quot;andM;HOURS AND HOLIDAYSandM;Our data shows that East Coast software companies tend to work a slightlylater shift than their West Coast counterparts, which is a reasonable way ofdealing with a nation-wide customer base:andM;The survey also shows that relatively few companies currently offer weekendsupport.andP;  Monday-Friday openings averaged 266 responses; Saturday, 35, andSunday, 24.andP;  the median number of holidays closed is nine; the 50% range is6-10 holidays.andM;ACTIVITY LEVELSandM;In analyzing our survey data on call volume and other measures of supportactivity, we broke out responses by company size and also looked at thesupport overhead for each company's &quot;most popular title.&quot;andM;* Call volume.andP;  Small companies (those with sales under $1 million) reportthat the median number of calls per month they receive for all titles is 60,compared to 400 for mid-sized companies ($1-$10 million) and 4,000 for largecompanies (over $10 million).andM;However, software companies often find that call volume can varyconsiderably, depending on seasonal factors, upgrade releases, etc.andP;  tomeasure these variations in volume, we polled our respondents on activitylevels per day during &quot;average, low-volume, and peak-volume periods.&quot;andP;  (Notethat the percentages of completed and abandoned calls often do not add up to100%, which suggests that many companies are overestimating their performancein answering the phone.)andM;* Telephone requirements.andP;  Tech support groups in small companies generallyoperate with three or fewer incoming lines and about the same number ofoutgoing lines.andP;  As companies grow bigger, the number of lines increases, ata rate which seems roughly proportional to total sales volume:andM;* Staffing requirements.andP;  Larger companies clearly enjoy some economies ofscale in tech support staffing.andP;  In small companies, the median number ofcalls handled per day is four; in large companies, the number is 25:andM;* Volume per copy.andP;  When we look just at each company's flagship or &quot;mostpopular&quot; product, we get a somewhat different picture that provides usefulguidelines for looking at the support requirements of single products.andP;  Forexample, looking at our sample of companies as a whole, we see that the &quot;mostpopular&quot; product generates a median of 150 calls per month, with a 50% rangeof 22 to 490 calls.andP;  We also find that each sale typically generates onesupport call, and that two-thirds of calls can be expected during the first90 days of sale:andM;* Reasons for calling.andP;  Finally, we looked at activity levels in terms of whycustomers required support.andP;  Overall, installation turns out to be theleading source of support requests, followed by product features.andP;  However,there are some significant variations between hardware platforms.andP;  We brokeout two sub-groups--one whose products are primarily DOS-based, and a secondwhose products are primarily Mac-based products.andP;  Mac titles clearly requireless support for installation procedures, but we were surprised to seerelatively little difference in printer and operating system supportrequirements:andM;TELEPHONE SUPPORTandM;Almost without exception, software companies base their tech support programsprimarily on telephone call-in service.andP;  We asked our respondents a group ofquestions that were designed to explore how they sell and deliver basic phonesupport services.andM;* Unlimited support?andP;  Despite the proliferation of paid support programs, themajority of companies in our sample (60%) still offer unlimited telephonesupport.andP;  About 17% of companies set some limit to the free support period,most commonly 90 days after purchase or--in some cases--after the first call.andO;A relatively small number of companies (2%) limit support to the currentversion, while 11% require customers to pay for support.andM;* Organizational issues.andP;  We also looked at how our respondents handled suchissues as toll-free lines, registration requirements, special support plansfor large customers and resellers, internal databases, upgrade sales, andmoney-back guarantees.andP;  Again, we broke out responses by company size.andP;  (Thechart shows the number of respondents who marked Yes, No, or Future checkboxes.)andM;STAFFINGandM;Although support is traditionally a people-intensive service, we find thatthe typical tech support department is relatively small.andP;  The median numberof employees in all support-related departments is three, with a 50% rangefor the whole sample of two to eight people:andM;* Scheduling.andP;  Because tech support employees often handle several differenttasks, we asked our survey respondents to break out the average number ofhours per week that their department allocates to various functions.andP;  We alsoasked respondents to identify how many of these scheduled hours wereperformed by full-time and part-time employees.andP;  (As usual, many respondentsseemed to have trouble dealing with statistics on part-time employees, so ourconfidence level in these benchmarks is lower than for other data in thesurvey.)andM;* Programmers.andP;  The survey shows that programmers in 67% of small companieshandle routine tech support calls, but the percentage drops dramatically inmid-sized companies to 23%.andP;  Only one company over $10 million (2%) in oursample says its programmers get involved in routine support.andM;* Hours on the phone.andP;  We asked respondents how many hours their techniciansare expected to spend on the phone during an eight-hour shift.andP;  The answerssuggest that tech support in many small companies is a part-time function(judging from the previous question, programmers often handle some of thesupport burden).andP;  For mid-sized and larger companies, however, supporttechnicians typically spend 5-6 hours per day handling calls.andM;* Time on the job.andP;  Tech support departments are notorious for burnoutproblems.andP;  Yet our survey data suggests that this reputation isn't entirelydeserved.andP;  We asked respondents whether &quot;most tecnical support employeesleave after one year or less, one to two years, or more than two years.&quot;andO;Except in very large companies, the most common answer was more than twoyears:andM;OTHER SUPPORT SERVICESandM;Our questionnaire explored other support services that many companiescurrently offer, including bulletin boards, personalized mail responses,newletters, consulting, and specialized printer support.andM;* Bulleting boards.andP;  Tech support bulletin boards are in place in asurprising number of companies, we find.andP;  Overall, 34% of our respondentsoperate a bulletin board; 26% plan to set one up in the future.andP;  When we lookat larger developers, the percentage rises even higher: 59% of companies over$10 million are already in the bulletin board business:andM;How active are these bulletin boards?andP;  The median number of callins per dayfor all bulletin baord operators is ten, with a 50% range of 5-35; the medianconnect time is ten minutes, with a 50% range of 5-20 minutes.andP;  However,activity levels vary a great deal from one product category to another(utilities seem to generate particularly high numbers of inquiries, whileprogramming tools and languages involve the longest average connect times).andM;Finally, we looked at who actually operates these bulletin boards.andP;  Theanswer: 75% of respondents rely on in-house staff, while 25% use a commercialon-line service.andM;* Mail responses.andP;  Especially as fax machines proliferate, tech supportdepartments are beginning to receive a growing volume of inquiries thatarrive in written form rather than by telephone.andP;  We asked our respondentshow many letters, faxes, and disks they receive per week, and whether theyencourage or discourage this activity.andP;  The median number of writtencommunications is ten items a week for the sample as a whole, with a 50%variation of 5-30 items; these levels do not vary much by product category:andM;About 9% of our respondents say they discourage written inquiries, 20% saythey prefer questions in writing, and a large majority--70%--have no policyon this issue.andM;* Newsletters.andP;  A fairly large number of support departments seem to publishtheir own newsletters; in fact, newsletters are about as common as bulletinboards:andM;The typical support newsletter is free to registered users (75% free, 12% bypaid subscription, 13% &quot;other&quot;).andP;  Publication frequency is usually 4-6 issuesper year (predictably, large companies tend to get out more issues than smallcompanies).andM;* Consulting services.andP;  We asked our respondents if they provide consultingfor &quot;systems analysis, application design, or other special services.&quot;andO;Overall, almost half--including a good many larger companies--say they dooffer such services.andM;The median rates for consulting services tend to reflect company size, thoughthe overall rate is $600 per day or $60 per hour:andM;* Printer support.andP;  Questions about printers and other output devices accountfor a large number of all tech support inquiries, and many of these questionsrequire fairly advanced technical assistance.andP;  Very few companies (2%overall) have set up dedicated printer support groups to deal with suchproblems, but we find that about 17% of our respondents are willing to writecustomized drivers to help users work with unusual printers.andM;PAID SUPPORTandM;Although paid support plans are still a fairly new phenomenon to manysoftware companies, we were able to identify a few basic trends in this area.andO;Our survey data shows that 36% of our respondents currently sell paid supportcontracts, and another 10% plan to offer such plans in the future:andM;* Pricing.andP;  The line between &quot;individual&quot; and &quot;corporate&quot; support contractsisn't always clear, so pricing comparisons are hard to make.andP;  Nevertheless,customers seem willing to pay relatively high rates: The median annualcontract fee is $245, with a 50% range of $99-$595.andM;* Contract components.andP;  We also find a good deal of diversity in the servicesthat are provided as part of these contracts.andP;  Of the 99 survey respondentswith paid support plans, 89 provide unlimited telephone support; 46 of thesealso offer a toll-free number.andP;  In addition, 56 give their contract customersa discount on upgrades, 53 send a newsletter, and 33 offer a bulletin board.andM;* Sign-up rates.andP;  Paid support contracts seem to be relatively attractive tousers.andP;  On the average, 37% of new customers sign up for paid contracts,along with 34% of older customers.andP;  Information about first-year renewalrates for these contracts is still a bit sketchy (only 57 respondents wereable to provide data), but the average is about 64%.andM;* Profitability.andP;  Paid support implies a somewhat higher standard of serviceand performance--and higher costs--than free support.andM;Thus, almost half (48%) of the companies with paid support report that theirprograms are &quot;marginal or breakeven,&quot; and another 19% say the effort has been&quot;unprofitable, but less costly than free support.&quot;andP;  Nevertheless, paidsupport can make money: 33% say paid support is &quot;a significant profit center&quot;for their companies.andP;  And the downside risk is apparently minimal--norespondent in the survey reports that paid support is &quot;more costly&quot; to thecompany than free support.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
