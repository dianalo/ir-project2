Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian said his government had takenmeasures to keep missiles from being sold to Iran for use in its7{-year-old war with Iraq.   Before selling intermediate-range conventional missiles to SaudiArabia, China made the Saudis promise to forgo transfer or firstuse of them, Wu said. The sale was regarded as unusual becauseChina and anti-communist Saudi Arabia do not have diplomaticrelations.   ``Our attitude on arms sales is a serious one; it's aresponsible one as well,'' Wu said heatedly when a reporter askedif China was willing to sell weapons to any buyer. ``Some presstend to pick on China, and whenever China sells weapons Chinabecomes the newsmaker.   ``How about the weapons flying around the (Persian) Gulf region... the Stinger and Exocet?'' he said, referring to U.S.- andFrench-made missiles.   Wu defended Chinese weapons sales at a wide-ranging 90-minutenews conference in Beijing's Great Hall of the People. He wasaccompanied by his deputy, Qian Qichen.   The Reagan administration last year suspended its liberalizationof high-tech equipment sales to China to punish Beijing for thealleged Silkworm missile sales to Iran. However, it lifted thefreeze during a visit by Wu last month.   China says it does not sell weapons to Iran or Iraq.   ``China has long adopted strict measures to prevent Chinesemissiles from flowing into Iran through the international market,''Wu said. He did not give details of the measures.   U.S. officials say China has shipped Silkworms to Iran via NorthKorea, not for ideological reasons but because the trade islucrative.   Iran, which has used Silkworms in attacks on Kuwaitiinstallations, claims it captured some of the missiles from Iraqand says it also makes its own.   Western observers estimate China sells about $2 billion inweapons each year, making it one of the world's top five armsexporters.   Wu said China is not willing to sell to any buyer. In the caseof the missile sale to Saudi Arabia, he said, increasing the Arabkingdom's defense capability ``is conducive to the stability of thesituation in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.''   On another issue Wednesday, Wu said his trip last month to theUnited States had improved U.S.-Chinese relations. They soured lastyear over China's arms sales and its use of military force to putdown independence protests in Tibet.   The officials also said China seeks to avoid war with Vietnamover the disputed Nansha Islands in the South China Sea, where thetwo countries' ships clashed last month.   Qian accused Vietnam of sending ships to the area ``to provokeChina.''   He also dismissed recent overtures from President Roh Tae-woo ofSouth Korea, saying China will never establish diplomatic relationswith that country. Beijing is a close ally of communist North Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
