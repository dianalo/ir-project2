In economic terms its rationality is overwhelming. The cocaine trade is a splendid example of &quot;market forces&quot; -- the subject of lavish praise these days -- in action.    Consider it first from the point of view of an Andean peasant. A short-term crop of maize gets him maybe $150 an acre; livestock just a few dollars an acre; coca maybe $5,000 or $10,000 an acre. Coca production uses plenty of labor and the peasants get well-paid. Because local processing is simple, it is easy to break monopolies in first-stage processing, so local middlemen and local commerce can thrive. The Andean flank of the Amazon basin is run by the coca trade and everything in the coca-producing countries rests on this huge economic base worth about $60 billion a year and creating more jobs and exports than anything else. Cocaine agriculture is development policy in the region.    And cocaine selling is a very rational career choice for a young black male in the U.S. inner city of today. If all roads lead to hell, why not take the one that's sometimes paved with gold? The rise of post-industrial America damaged many lives, but none more than that of the black male. Take Los Angeles. In a fairly brief period about 80,000 industrial jobs, in auto assembly, tires and similar occupations, disappeared. The life supports of well over a million people were therefore cut, with no alternative in sight and almost no safety net provided by a city that has seen no public housing constructed since shortly after World War II.    Crack distribution offers escape from poverty and despair. The rewards are high (as are the occupational risks) and the wider society wholeheartedly endorses the ethic of rapid, brutish accumulation. As with liquor distribution during Prohibition, cocaine offers substantial new opportunity for stifled entrepreneurial vigor.    The political culture that created the conditions in which crack selling is the rational career choice for a black 16-year-old now views the drug &quot;problem&quot; with emotions well beyond hysteria. The newspapers regularly carry letters urging mandatory life imprisonment and not infrequently execution for offenders.    In fact, the larger society is not overly distressed by the consequences of the drug culture so long as they remain within the ghettos of the have-nots. A mayor or a policeman would rather see a black youth with crack in his pocket than the writings of Malcolm X, or the late Huey Newton dealing in drugs rather than organizing the resistance. If the Crips and Bloods of Los Angeles were only to kill each other, no great perturbation would transpire. But policemen and politicians don't like headlines about innocent bystanders or tourists being caught in cross fire.    A &quot;war&quot; on drugs, like any war on crime, has distinct political advantages. It is popular with white, middle-class voters. It doesn't cost much, and it enables police chiefs to urge successfully the removal of vexatious laws protecting individual rights. In the present drug &quot;war,&quot; long-cherished constitutional protections are being shunted aside with the same elan as Chief Darrell Gates's battering ram bashing in the doors of suspected crack houses in Los Angeles. In the end, the &quot;war&quot; adds up as a boom in prison construction.    The White House likes wars on drugs in Latin America for the same sort of reasons. A Congress that balked at direct U.S. military intervention in Nicaragua has no qualms about seeing DEA hardware on tarmacs in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, and does not lose sleep asking whether the taxpayers' money is being spent in a war on drugs or on left-wing guerrillas.    As others have remarked recently, U.S. government policy on drugs adds up as a prison state for black America and a Viet Nam war in the Andes.    It's not as though Colombia is seeing decades of civic calm disturbed by the gunslingers of the cartel. The &quot;violencia&quot; of an earlier period killed, according to many reckonings, more than 200,000 people, which makes the rampages of the men of Medellin look sedate by comparison. No government is going to spurn $65 million, which is what the U.S. is sending Colombia to beat the drug lords, even though the Colombians probably wish the U.S. had kept its $65 million and not sabotaged the international coffee agreement, an act that could cost Colombia $800 million a year.    Almost everything about the drug &quot;war&quot; has to be translated. The Colombian army is not locked in a life or death struggle with the cartel, but rather locked in with the cartel in a predictable fructifying alliance, against the FARC and M-19 left-wing guerrilla movements and others who interfere in a lucrative business. The army and the government were not at all distressed to see more than a thousand leftist activists, who had embarked upon legal opposition activities, get murdered by right-wing death squads. This relaxed attitude to political assassination was matched by the U.S. press and by the U.S. government, which has barely reported these killings.    Nor can this same U.S. government pretend to much revulsion against the cartel. According to one Medellin employee, Ramon Melian Rodriguez, now in prison in the U.S., the U.S. government has been dealing with the cartel for years. One of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega's functions was to act as intermediary in transactions that included the supply by the Medellin cartel of large sums of money to the Nicaragua Contras.    From peasant to president, therefore, we can see that rationality prevails. U.S. drug aid to Colombia will no doubt end up in the pockets of Colombian cocaine executives, just as similar aid to Afghanistan has greased the wheels of the heroin convoys. This is rational, too, since it is politically easier to throw money at the problem, so long as the money lands somewhere on the other side of the world, rather than on a street in a black slum where a member of the dangerous, undeserving and now superfluous classes might pick it up.    President Bush concluded his address to the nation Tuesday night by citing a newspaper story about a little boy in Washington D.C. suburb who had said he didn't want to sell drugs but was nonetheless resigned to the fact that selling drugs is what he might well end up doing. The president expressed the hope that his $8 billion plan to end the drug trade would keep the lad out of the drug business. But neither Mr. Bush nor any other politician seems to have any idea of what else this boy and his fellows might look to in order to keep body and soul together.    ---   Afterword: Three weeks ago I described the menace of pharmaceutical production on my boyhood turf of east Cork in the Ireland, and suggested local hostility might halt it. On Monday, Merrell Dow, subsidiary of Dow Chemical, announced that for tax and merger reasons it would not be building a plant near Killeagh. The Irish Industrial Development Authority told the Irish press that Merrell Dow had &quot;insisted&quot; that but for local opposition, which had delayed construction, the plant would have gone ahead.    ---   Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and LA Weekly. </TEXT></DOC>
