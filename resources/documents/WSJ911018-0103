However, the company's operating earnings fell 18%,driving down its stock price.   The long-distance telephone company reported net income of$140 million, or 51 cents a share, against a year-earlierloss of $168 million, or 69 cents a share, resulting from$550 million in charges associated with accelerated networkdigitization. Revenue rose 2.4% to $2.15 billion from $2billion in 1990.</LP><TEXT>   MCI's nine-month net was $407 million, or $1.48 a share,vs. $172 million, or 59 cents a share, a year ago. Revenuewas $6.27 billion, up from $5.68 billion last year.   However, the turnabout didn't help MCI's shares, whichtook a pounding after the announcement, dropping $3 to closeat $27.125 in national over-the-counter trading. Volume wasvery heavy at nearly 5.7 million shares.   Investors didn't like MCI's margins in the third quarteror the marketing counterattack MCI now faces from its chiefrivals American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and US SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.   Moreover, after the market closed, International BusinessMachines Corp. said it is exploring selling its $400 millionstake in MCI preferred stock. IBM has held the stake since1988 when it took the stock as payment from MCI for commonstock it had held in the long-distance company. IBM and MCIwere unavailable for comment.   MCI said it has won a strong customer response to newmarketing plans such as its Friends and Family long-distancediscount program, which Bert C. Roberts, president and chiefoperating officer, said lured three million new customers inthe quarter. But analysts said the program and othermarketing incentives pushed down MCI's profit margins to12.8% from 13.2%. Excluding the charge of $550 million a yearearlier, MCI's operating earnings in the recent quarter weredown about 18% to $274 million from $334 million.   Consequently, Robert B. Morris III, an analyst at Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co., cut his 1991 earnings estimates for MCI to $2from $2.10 a share and his 1992 estimates to between $2.35and $2.40 from $2.50.   The preferred stock held by IBM is effectively debt, whichMr. Morris said he expected MCI to pay back before 1995 whenthe issue's interest rate is due to take a sharp jump to10.35% from 7.38% for each $200 share. By 1996 the interestjumps again to $21.20 for a yield of 10.6%.   Separately, MCI signed an agreement with British TelecomPLC to allow each company to validate the other's customertelephone charge cards, so that either card may be used inthe U.S. or Britain to call most countries.</TEXT></DOC>
