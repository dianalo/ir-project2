The Indexis based on the measured concentrations of the pollutants, sulphur dioxideand suspended particulate matter, that form the basis of our Air PollutionIndex (API), used to control industrial emissions during poor dispersionconditions, as well as carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and totalreduced sulphur compounds, for which concentrations are known to causevariable adverse effects, depending on their levels. The new Index, designedto be numerically consistent with the API, is related to Ontario's publishedair quality criteria for desirable air as well as the Canadian MaximumDesirable, Acceptable, and Tolerable Objectives. These are based on studiesof the effects of each of the pollutants on health, vegetation and property.</TEXT></DOC>
