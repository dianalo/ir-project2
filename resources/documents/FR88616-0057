The project consists of constructing anew ash disposal facility, closure and abandonment of the existing ashdisposal site, construction of a new city water well and extension of thecity water main in Grant County, Wisconsin. The proposed landfill siteis located within EJS facility and has been owned by DPC since the originalplant site was acquired. The landfill site is approximately 213 meters(700 ft) away from the EJS generation site and there are no residencesalong the road connnecting the generation site and the landfill site. TheBER and EA adequately consider the potential impacts of the proposed projectand concluded that approval of the project would not result in a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.REA determined that the proposed project will have no effect on air quality,water quality, aesthetics, floodplains, wetlands, important farmlands,prime rangelands or forest lands, threatened or endangered species or criticalhabitat, or any property listed or eligible for listing in the <T3>National Register of Historic Places</T3>. REA has identified no othermatters of potential environmental concern related to the proposed project.Various alternatives to the proposed project were considered, includingno action, alternative sites, purchase of power, and alternative methodsof ash disposal. REA determined that the proposed project is an environmentallyacceptable alternative that meets DPC's need with a minimum of adverseenvironmental impact. REA has concluded that project approval would notconstitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality ofthe human environment. Therefore, the preparation of an Environmental ImpactStatement is not necessary.In accordance with REA's Environmental Policies and Procedures, 7 CFR Part1794, DPC advertised and requested comments on the environmental aspectof the proposed project in the Grant County Herald Independent, a publicweekly newspaper of general circulation.
