(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Knight, Kevin.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The unification problem has been studied widely, but researchersin one field are often unaware of research being conducted on thesame problem in other fields.andP;  Relationships among variousconcepts of unification are clarified through presentation ofseveral variants of the unification problem and discussion ofvarious algorithms and data structures.andP;  Among the areas ofcomputer science in which unification is studied are theoremproving, logic programming and natural language processing.andO;Topics discussed here include uses of unification, specialproblems encountered, resolution, high order logic, the occurcheck, infinite terms, feature structures, equational theories,inheritance, parallel algorithms, generalization and lattices.andO;The unification problem is stated thusly: given two descriptionsof 'x' and 'y', is there an object 'z' that fits bothdescriptions?andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Algorithm AnalysisComputational ComplexityTheoretical ResearchArtificial IntelligenceNatural Language InterfacesNonnumerical AlgorithmsMathematics of ComputingNew TechniqueProgram Development Techniques.andO;Feature:   illustrationprogram.andO;Caption:   A version of Robinson's original unification algorithm.
