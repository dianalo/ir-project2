Byrd and other senators were seeking a compromise that wouldpermit approval of the bill, which authorizes Pentagon spending of$299.5 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 .   The fight involves an amendment that would let dealers convictedof killing someone to be sentenced to death.   Opponents threatened a filibuster against the proposal afterthey threatened to kill it.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., chief author of the amendment, hasrefused to remove it from the Pentagon bill unless he receivesassurances from Democratic leaders that it will be returned to theSenate floor later with the promise of a certain vote.   ``We've been trying to get a vote on this for years,'' D'Amatosaid Tuesday.   Three anti-drug proposals have already been attached to thebill, including one that would increase the military's involvementin the effort to halt illegal drug trafficking.   ``We've got to catch them first, and then we can take care ofthe penalties. This bill, with the changes we've made, would helpus catch them. Let us go ahead,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Armed Services Committee.   In his appeal to D'Amato, Nunn noted D'Amato was also a majorsponsor of the amendment ordering the military to help catch drugtraffickers.   The Senate voted easy approval Tuesday of a pair of amendentsexpressing displeasure with reports that Reagan is negotiating withPanama's military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Noriega has been indicted on drug charges in Florida, but he hasrefused to quit. U.S. economic sanctions have thus far beenineffective in forcing him out and there are reports theadministration is considering dropping the charges in return forNoriega stepping down.   The Senate first voted 95-0 approval of an amendment by Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., which provides that no U.S. aid be sent toPanama until Noriega leaves power and until Reagan certifies thatno Soviet or Cuban troops are in the Central American nation.   Then the Senate passed, 86-10, a resolution offered by SenateRepublican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas that put the Senate on recordas opposing any deal in which U.S. drug-trafficking charges wouldbe dropped.   Senate passage will send the measure to a conference committeeto be reconciled with the separate Pentagon budget bill passed aweek ago by the House.   That bill also includes an anti-drug provision, stiffer than theSenate proposal, which orders Reagan to have the militaryessentially seal off U.S. borders against drug trafficking.   Other differences between the bills include:</TEXT><TEXT>   STAR WARS _ The Senate measure proposed $4.6 billion forReagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, while the House voted $3.5billion. Reagan had sought $4.8 billion. The most likely compromisewould grant about $4.1 billion, which would be an increase over thecurrent SDI budget of $3.9 billion.   PAY RAISE _ The Senate approved Reagan's request for a 4.3percent average pay hike for the nation's 2.1 million uniformedmilitary personnel, while the House voted for a 4 percent increase.   ARMS CONTROL _ Both bills ban any SDI tests that would violatethe existing, ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile treaty. But the House measure contains two otherrestrictions, including a ban on spending for any weapons thatviolate numerical restrictions on various categories of weapons inthe unratified 1979 SALT II treaty, and a ban on all but thesmallest tests of U.S. nuclear weapons.   BASE CLOSINGS _ The Senate bill creates a 15-member Pentagoncommission to study the nation's 3,600 military installations andrecommend by Dec. 31 which ones can be closed. No such provision ispart of the House bill, although that chamber will consider thebase-closing idea in a separate bill.   CENTRAL AMERICA _ The House bill includes a prohibition againstsending any U.S. combat troops to leftist-ruled Nicaragua, a banthe Senate refused to add.</TEXT></DOC>
