Mark Hopkins, correspondent for the U.S. government-run Voice ofAmerica radio network, was given 72 hours to leave China, said VOADirector Richard W. Carlson in a telephone interview from Washington.   Hopkins was called this morning to the Beijing State SecurityBureau and accused of breaking martial law, instigating propagandaand violating the terms of his tourist visa, Carlson said.   ``We reject all the allegations,'' Carlson said. ``They're mad atthe messenger.''   Hopkins was the second VOA reporter and the fourth Americanjournalist ordered out of the country since the crackdown againstpro-democracy protesters began in Beijing on June 3-4. A total ofseven foreign journalists have been ordered expelled from China.   On the domestic front, Communist Party hardliners who called thearmy in to put down student pro-democracy protesters appeareddetermined to wipe out moral and cultural backsliding as well aspolitical dissent.   A forum organized by the party Propaganda Department denouncedthe spread of pornography and blamed it on ousted party chief ZhaoZiyang, while police raided Beijing book stalls and confiscatedbanned books. One province ordered that copies of a banned book beburned.   A high-level government advisory body, the Chinese People'sPolitical Consulative Conference, adopted a resolution condemningwhat it called ``the anti-China wave stirred up by the reactionaryforces in the West.''   The official Xinhua News Agency reported the resolution, whichalso vowed to ``continue to develop friendly ties with allcountries.''   Many governments deplored China's June 3-4 army attack on thestudent-led protesters for a freer society. The United States, Japanand European countries imposed limited economic sanctions.   China has responded with a series of increasingly defensivestatements reflecting a siege mentality not seen in more than adecade.   The media directed its sharpest words against the United States,which it accused of human rights violations in its treatment ofminorities and demonstrators.   ``Is America in any position to say anything to China?'' asked acommentary in the party newspaper, the People's Daily.   China accused France of violating international law by allowingtwo Chinese fugitives to criticize China from French soil.   The two, student leader Wu'er Kaixi and leading politicaltheorist Yan Jiaqi, were believed to be in Paris on Monday when theyannounced a new coalition to fight for freedom in China.   On Monday, China filed a protest about French demonstrators whooccupied part of China's embassy in Paris for several hours.   Xinhua said China's U.N. ambassador, Ding Yuanhong, sent a letterto U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, rejecting acharge by El Salvador that the crackdown was a human rightsviolation.   China took a softer tone toward Hong Kong and Macao, whoseresidents have been among the most outspoken in condemning thecrackdown.   Jiang Zemin, the new party general secretary, told a delegationfrom Hong Kong and Macao that China would abide by its ``onecountry, two systems'' policy under which they could keep theircapitalist systems for 50 years after reverting to Chinese rule.Britain is scheduled to return Hong Kong to China in 1997, andPortugal returns Macao in 1999.   According to Xinhua, however, Jiang emphasized the need to end``erroneous ideological trends'' and ``unfair distribution ofincome'' in China _ comments not likely to reassure residents of thefree-wheeling enclaves.   Conservative party officials now firmly in power after severalyears of eclipse appeared anxious to seize the opportunity to excisecultural as well as political deviations. The Propaganda Departmentorganized a forum of writers and artists to demand a cleanup of whatone speaker called ``all sorts of garbage (that have) appeared inour society.''   Parts of the forum were shown on television.   Under Zhao, ``there was no distinction between right and wrong,''said Zhang Jigong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of SocialSciences. ``Sex and violence filled the literary market.''   The Beijing Evening News said police in Beijing's universitydistrict raided book stalls and confiscated ``a large number'' ofbanned books and magazines. It described the books as containingpornography, violence and ``reactionary superstition.''   Authorities also went after books with politically suspectcontents. In northwestern Shaanxi province, censors banned a bookthat praised a Chinese journalist, Liu Binyan, who is in the UnitedStates and has condemned the crackdown. An editor who worked on thebook was fired.</TEXT></DOC>
