SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Spring flooding is threatening the Ohio andlower Mississippi River basins and several areas along the Canadianborder, while California and the Missouri basin face the possibilityof more drought, the National Weather Service reports.   Spring snowmelt conditions were detailed Tuesday by the weatherservice in a report that agency scientist Michael Hudlow saidpresented ``hydrological extremes'' in various parts of the nation.   California faces the most crucial test in the next couple ofmonths with the possibility of a third consecutive dry summer forthe first time in this century.   On a national basis the potential for drought doesn't appear assevere as last summer, said Hudlow, ``but there are some areas thatdefinitely bear watching.''   Meanwhile, portions of Kentucky and other southern states havealready experienced flooding and have saturated soil that could posea continuing danger in the runoff season.   There also is potential for spring snowmelt flooding in northernNorth Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and NewEngland, Hudlow said.   In addition to California and the Missouri Valley, the spectre ofdrought hangs over the Boston and New York metropolitan areas andthe Delaware River Valley, said Hudlow.   He noted that some potential good news was included, with boththe 30-day and 90-day weather outlooks indicating a chance forabove-normal moisture in California.   But that is not a guarantee, and the mountain snowpack thatprovides most summer moisture to the Golden State is well belownormal. California's reservoirs are already low, following two dryyears, and in some parts of the state stream flow appears likely tofall to less than 20 percent of normal, he said. The weather overthe next two months is critical, Hudlow said, noting that by May thestate enters a normally dry season.   Hudlow, the weather service's director of hydrology, rejected thesuggestion that global ``greenhouse'' warming could be the cause ofthis dryness.   He attributed the conditions to the regular variability ofclimate, as well as changes in the movement of the jet stream thatsteers storm systems in from the Pacific Ocean. In addition, hesaid, unusually cold water conditions in the Pacific are likelyhaving an effect in reducing California's moisture.   The second area of potential drought is the Missouri Valley,where last summer's dryness lowered reservoir levels and damagedcrops.   ``A lot hangs in the balance of the next few months'' for thisarea also, said Richard DiBouno of the Army Corps of Engineers.   He said the snow cover is about 84 percent of normal over theMissouri Valley, but it would take five years of normal moisture torefill reservoirs depleted by the recent drought.   In addition, he noted that the Missouri is a major supplier ofwater to the lower Mississippi, so continued dry conditions couldaffect regions downstream.   Southern Florida also was cited by Hudlow as a major dry area,and the threat of water supply shortages also covers Boston, NewYork and the Delaware River basin.   On the other side of the coin, flooding already has occurred inthe Ohio and lower Mississippi River valleys, Hudlow noted. Theground is saturated in those areas and spring snowmelt could resultin further flooding problems.   Major storms could lead to flooding in areas from east Texaseastward into the southern Appalachian Mountains and north to theOhio valley, he said.   In addition, a heavy snowpack poses the potential for dangerousflooding in drainage areas around Lake Superior westward through theupper Mississippi, Rainy, Souris and Red River basins.   Flooding is also possible, but less likely, in the Adirondackregion of New York state, the Green Mountains of Vermont, WhiteMountains in New Hampshire and in northern Maine, Hudlow said.</TEXT></DOC>
