Members of the foreign affairs committees of the SupremeSoviet's two chambers met in a brief joint session to unanimouslyendorse the treaty and send it to the Presidium, the highestexecutive body, for ratification.   President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the pact todestroy U.S. and Soviet medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles,on Dec. 8 in Washington. They begin another summit Sunday in Moscowand hope the treaty will be ratified before it ends.   Yegor K. Ligachev, No. 2 in the Kremlin to Gorbachev, presidedat the meeting of about 20 committee members. It was theculmination of a process begun Feb. 9, when Foreign Minister EduardA. Shevardnadze appeared before lawmakers to speak for the treaty.   By approving ratification, the committees set the stage forfinal action by the Presidium, which ratifies internationalagreements.   Soviet ratification has been considered certain because thetreaty was endorsed by the Politburo, supreme body of the CommunistParty, and signed by Gorbachev, who is both Communist Party chiefand a Presidium member.   Soviet officials have acknowldged, however, that they want theformal ratification processes in both countries to proceedtogether. The Senate is not expected to act on the treaty this week.   Viktor P. Karpov, head of the Foreign Ministry arms control anddisarmament desk, told Western reporters his country should notratify the treaty before the United States.   ``I think it depends on the decision of the U.S. Senate,'' hesaid at the end of the committee meeting, which lasted just over anhour. ``I think we should wait for the decision to be made. Weshould be sure that we are not alone.''   The Soviets have said past U.S. actions on arms control treatiesmade them wary of moving too rapidly with ratification of thelatest agreement.   In 1979, the Washington and Moscow signed SALT II setting limitson long-range nuclear weapons. President Jimmy Carter withdrew itfrom Senate consideration after the Soviets sent soldiers intoAfghanistan in December of that year.   Karpov said endorsement by the Supreme Soviet committees showedhis country supports the treaty, and declared: ``We are ready toratify it, and (they) have recommended to the Presidium of theSupreme Soviet to ratify it.''   Tuesday is opening day for the regular spring session of the1,500-member Supreme Soviet, but there has been no officialindication it will act on the treaty. A vote by the full membershipis not needed for ratification.   Anatoly F. Dobrynin, Communist Party foreign affairs secretaryand former ambassador to Washington, expressed hope at thecommittee meeting that the Senate would act on the treaty beforethe summit.   Dobrynin attended the meeting as chairman of the Foreign AffairsCommission of the Soviet of Nationalties. Ligachev chairs theequivalent committee in the other chamber, the Soviet of the Union.   A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee said earlierMonday that U.S. ratification during the summit remains possiblebut some senators still have questions about the treaty.   Sen. William Cohen, a Maine Republican, told CBS News that threeconservative Republicans still want to debate some issues and that``will take a good part of this week to conclude.''   At least 67 votes in the 100-member Senate are required forratification.   On April 20, a commission created by the two committees of theSupreme Soviet recommended ratification.   Its chairman, Georgi M. Kornienko, said at the Monday meetingthe treaty would remove ``two links of the nuclear chain that havecircled our Mother Earth.''</TEXT></DOC>
