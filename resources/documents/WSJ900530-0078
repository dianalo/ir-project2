Butsomehow the agreements that Secretary of State Baker has soarduously prepared for this meeting between George Bush andMikhail Gorbachev seem to be at the periphery of the eventsnow driving the world.   The Mikhail Gorbachev who arrives today in the U.S. mayhave been the catalyst for many of these forces (he didn'tcreate the forces named Solidarity and Sakharov) but it canhardly be said that he controls them. He is trying to controlthem, and they are trying to control their own destinies. Theworld's cameras may focus on another U.S.-Soviet Summit, butthe real game is elsewhere.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Yeltsin                                                                                                          Boris Yeltsin's election to the presidency of the RussianFederation yesterday moved the Soviet Union another largestep toward political fragmentation. President Yeltsin wastedno time in challenging the authority of President Gorbachev,declaring that his victory marks the &quot;blossoming of Russia asa sovereign, independent government in the framework of theunion.&quot; He immediately tested that proposition, calling onthe Russian Federation parliament to reject the economicreform announced by the central government last Thursday.Again, Mr. Gorbachev had offered too little, too late.   If Mr. Yeltsin is able to take Russia down an independentpath, Mr. Gorbachev's own recent elevation to the newlycreated presidency of the Soviet Union would look ratherhollow. The Soviet President would find himself to be thePresident of a &quot;union&quot; no longer united.   The Baltic states will continue to press their bids forindependence. Georgia wants out, too. Armenia is engaged inarmed revolt. Resentments are smoldering in the Islamicrepublics and could burst into flames at any moment. Ukraineis restive and also has rejected the economic plan. Now thepresidency of Russia itself, with half of the population ofthe entire union, has fallen to Mr. Gorbachev's mostimportant rival.   The contest between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev has notyet been decided, of course. President Gorbachev will attemptto renew his party support at the important all-union partycongress scheduled for early July, but no one yet knows howthat will turn out.                                                                                                          The Soviet Economy                                                                                                          Mr. Yeltsin's victory yesterday was directly attributableto the half-baked government economic program presented tothe Soviet parliament. By announcing future price increases,it touched off a consumer panic, further depleting alreadybarren store shelves. Because it was yet another ineffectualstep toward the &quot;market economics&quot; Mr. Gorbachev keepspromising, it played directly into Mr. Yeltsin's claims thathis rival is a &quot;lover of half measures and half steps.&quot;   The Soviet Union may be facing both fragmentation andeconomic collapse. It may in fact be necessary for both ofthose two things to happen if the death grip of the CommunistParty and its associated bureaucracy is ever to be broken.Already, local authorities are taking more and more economicmatters into their own hands, not just in the smallerrepublics but within the Russian republic itself. Moscow'snew mayor, Gavriil Popov, seems serious about conducting thecity itself down an independent path. Russian cities andregions talk much these days of withholding the fruits oftheir local economies from Moscow.   In other words, Mr. Gorbachev's main opposition is comingfrom parties and factions that want a more liberal anddemocratic Soviet Union, not from forces that threaten toinstall a new tyranny. He was given his sweeping powers by aCommunist Party that is trying to do the impossible, retaincommunism and at the same time bring about an economicreform. Since that cannot be done, it is quite possible thateconomic collapse is inevitable. And if it is, there may belittle the West can do to prevent it.                                                                                                          Germany and Europe                                                                                                          If as seems likely Presidents Bush and Gorbachev plan tobargain over a reunified Germany's membership in NATO, theyare behind the power curve. Both reunification and NATOmembership are, for all practical purposes, a fait accompli.   Germany effectively reunified on May 18 with the signingof a German-German treaty that, by various estimates, movestwo-thirds to three-quarters of the way toward fullunification. Economic integration, one of the mostsignificant steps, will begin July 2. Germany already isspeaking with one voice, saying that it has no intention ofleaving NATO.   More quietly, out of consideration for Sovietsensibilities, it is saying as well that the Russians neednot expect much German economic cooperation so long as Soviettroops remain on German soil. That point, made by thestrongest economic power in Europe, is not lost on a Sovietleadership trying to head off an economic crisis.   Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gorbachev are in a good positionto bargain over something the German people already havedecided. Indeed, peoples throughout central Europe are takinga good many decisions out of the hands of the superpowers.But this does not mean Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev havenothing to talk about. The Soviet foot-dragging in theconventional forces reduction talks in Vienna, plus thesuspension of their troop withdrawal from Germany, are worthyof serious discussion. When Poland, after a long struggle,broke its ties with the Soviet Communist Party, a certainchain of events was inevitable. Today, the Warsaw Pact,through which the Soviets legitimized their control over muchof central Europe, is a hollow shell. National governmentsare taking command of Warsaw Pact armies, breaking thecommand and control chain that previously led to the defensecouncil of the central committee of the Soviet CommunistParty.   It should be noted that Soviet ineffectuality is only anassumption. Armies are trained to fight. Soviet troops stilloccupy key territories where they are not wanted. Sovietmissiles and warheads are just as destructive as ever. Butcountries that were Soviet &quot;satellites&quot; a short while ago aremaking their own decisions, not to mention the Sovietrepublics themselves. The United States cannot protect Mr.Gorbachev from these powerful forces. Mr. Bush should makethat clear this week. It can only support positive stepstoward peace, such as Germany's decision to stay in NATO, anddiscourage negative ones, such as the delay in Soviet troopwithdrawals.                                                                                                          The West's Response                                                                                                          As counterpoint to the cacophony in the Soviet Union weare beginning to hear a new version of an old song in theWest. It says, in effect, that the U.S. and Western Europeshouldn't take undue advantage. Don't threaten to exclude theSoviets from the new Europe. Don't excite the Soviet marshalsand generals into doing something rash. There is even talk ofa &quot;Weimar Russia,&quot; a weak and ravaged state that would spawnsome new tyrant.   There is as yet no evidence that the Soviet Union is inany danger of being excluded from Europe. Europe extends tothe Urals and even a singular Russia, denuded of all itsempire, would remain the strongest military power in Europe.With its tank armies, missiles and nuclear warheads, it looksnothing at all like a forcibly disarmed Weimar Germany.   That does not mean that the U.S. and the West need bevindictive toward Mr. Gorbachev or the peoples who live underSoviet rule. It is indeed important for the West to encourageall the positive impulses it can discover in the new orderthat surely must emerge from the wreckage of the Russianempire.   The U.S. and Europe can best defend the cause of peace bycontinuing to uphold liberal, free-market democracy and byretaining a military defense capable of dissuading even themost radical Soviet general from trying to solve thecountry's problems with a new military adventure.   At Kennebunkport this past weekend, reporters pressed Mr.Bush with questions along the newly emerging theme that theWest might try to take advantage of a weakening Sovietleadership. We liked Mr. Bush's responses. He admitted thatMr. Gorbachev has &quot;enormous problems,&quot; but said it was notthe business of the U.S. to try to sort out those problems.&quot;It is our business to make clear to him what we can do andthose things we can't do.&quot;   Throughout the post-war period, the Soviet Union has actedapart from history, a state that contributed nothing tomankind other than fear of its presence. Often in recentyears, the West's favored means of response to this statusquo was to periodically sign an agreement over arms that borelittle relation to political events on the ground. Now thatis changing, and if the meeting over the next several daysbetween President Bush and Mr. Gorbachev seems a bit besidethe point, it is because the Soviet leadership has at lastclimbed down from the Summit and rejoined a world of realpolitics and real economies. The fall of the Summit'simportance is itself a symptom of progress.</TEXT></DOC>
