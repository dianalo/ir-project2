VAX 8800 at ASCS headquartersin Washington.andP;  It has data from ASCS county offices across the country.andP;  Thesystem runs under VMS with DEC's Rdb database management system.andM;Although ASCS managers will use the system first, it also may see action atthe USDA secretary's level, Covello said.andM;&quot;We believe it's going to be a very successful application,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It'stargeted at upper management, but I hope it becomes more widely available.&quot;andM;ASCS' mission is to stabilize farm commodity prices and conserve land.andP;  Theagency supports prices sometimes by buying crops at targeted prices andsometimes by paying for lower production by farmers to hold down supply.andM;Covello's staff has been working on the system for nearly a year and now istesting it, he said.andP;  Work on the prototype will be completed by May, hesaid.andP;  Covello's staff developed the system using Natural Language Inc.'sNatural Language system.andP;  ASCS spent about $50,000 on the Berkeley, Calif.,andO;company's software.andM;The prototype system contains about 25 tables, each with between 1,000 and300,000 records.andP;  Once deployed the sytem will have an extra 25 to 50 tables,each with 100,000 to 300,000 records, Covello said.andM;Last year, Covello's staff began contemplating an executive informationsystem for the agency's top executives.andP;  However, much of the informationthey required was not in machine-readable form or existed only in batch mode,Covello said.andM;ASCS has nearly 3,000 county offices, each with heaps of farm and crop data.andM;&quot;With so many offices you can imagine the amount of information we have todeal with,&quot; Covello said.andP;  &quot;We had a data administration issue that had to besolved: how we could access all that data and use it for administrativepurposes.&quot;andM;The group developed a menu-driven system -- a series of screens written inthe Focus fourth-generation language from Information Builders Inc., New York-- to manage and access the data.andP;  Users will be able to access the &quot;PlainEnglish&quot; system by selecting it on the ASCS executive information systemmenu.andM;&quot;But we knew we'd run into queries that wouldn't be suitable for thatsystem,&quot; Covello said.andP;  &quot;For instance, a congressman might call us to askabout the status of the XYZ program in his county or state.andP;  That informationis not easily accessible without a series of complex queries.&quot;andM;Another use might be to generate quick responses to Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission queries, he said.andM;Covello's staff did a technology assessment and decided a natural languagesystem could solve their problems, Covello said.andM;Echo DisplayedandM;The Natural Language product delivers the best answer it can find from theinformation in the user's database, company officials said.andP;  When a userenters an English question, the natural language processor uses its knowledgebase and English grammar rules to reason about the question.andP;  It produces aninternal representation of what the question actually means and generates anEnglish paraphrase or &quot;echo&quot; for the user to see.andM;Following the echo, Natural Language generates a formal Structured QueryLanguage query that gets the answer from the database.andP;  The productunderstands different versions of the same question.andP;  It also includesinteractive learning features and lets users create reports, manipulatecolumns and save output and SQL in ASCII files.andM;The prototype's database has information on the ASCS county offices and theiremployees.andP;  It also contains information on expenses, payments, producers,farms and crops, Covello said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
