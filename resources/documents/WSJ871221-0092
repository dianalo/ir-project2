Sease</HL><DD> 12/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   With only four days to go in the Christmas shopping season, the retail sector of the nation's economy remains a big question mark for most investors.    The shopping season started poorly and, by many accounts, hasn't much improved in the past week or so. Heavy discounts seem to be the strategy of choice as retailers trade profit margins for volume. To investors that might seem bad news indeed, since they're looking at consumer spending as a measure of how the stock market crash is affecting the economy.    But among some market professionals, there's a growing feeling that investors are putting too much emphasis on Christmas sales. What's more, some are even suggesting that what the financial markets really need isn't robust sales, but a consumer slowdown that would stem the flow of imports.    One problem with trying to read anything into holiday sales is that the results won't be clear until at least mid-January. That's when post-holiday inventory levels will begin to become apparent, and there's some feeling that retailers might not be in as bad a shape as some people suspect.    When the stock market crashed Oct. 19, &quot;Retailers hit the panic button, canceling every order they could and not buying any more,&quot; said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. As a result, he figures that most retailers will be able to head into the spring season with relatively lean inventories. He's even somewhat optimistic about retail stocks on the ground that &quot;all the concern and negativism are more than reflected in the current prices of the stocks.&quot;    But regardless of how sales go, some analysts suggest that the link between retail sales and the Oct. 19 crash might be tenuous at best. Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel, said that consumers had been slowing their purchases all year. Investors who are looking for a big consumer pullback because of the crash may be suffering from what she calls &quot;Wall Street tunnel vision.&quot;    &quot;We as an industry and New York as a community have been more affected by what happened&quot; than the rest of the country, she said. &quot;As long as the consumer feels comfortable and doesn't think he will lose his job there's no reason to expect a decline in the economy.&quot;    Perhaps more important, some experts contend that consumer spending simply isn't as important as it once was. &quot;The big consumer spending boom that actually began in the late '50s is peaking for economic and demographic reasons,&quot; said Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. Not only are consumers so heavily in debt that they're finding it difficult to finance further spending, but as the nation's population ages, spending will decline anyway, he said.    At the same time, he said, the steady fall of the dollar since early 1985 has given new impetus to U.S. industry, easing the pressures of foreign competitors here at home and opening a host of opportunities for export. &quot;The industrial sector is in the early stages of a prolonged boom that could last five to 10 years,&quot; said Mr. Clough.    Economists such as Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Thomson McKinnon Securities, argue that those changed circumstances have altered the way investors should think about economic news. He's one of the advocates of a theory that says strong retail sales right now are bad news, not good news. That's because strong retail sales are the fuel that brings imported consumer goods flooding into the U.S. That, in turn, weakens the dollar, raises interest rates and increases inflationary pressure.    Mr. Clough agrees and even goes so far as to argue that a consumer recession is desirable. His reasoning: It would reduce imports sharply, since most imports are consumer goods, while not affecting U.S. exports, which are mostly industrial goods. The resulting swift reduction in the nation's trade deficit would stabilize the dollar and provide the Federal Reserve Board with some leeway to reflate the economy without triggering inflation.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Heavy buying as futures contracts expired and a reassurance from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the record October trade deficit was &quot;an aberration&quot; sent stock prices soaring in heavy trading, providing a second consecutive record weekly gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    After falling 50.07 Thursday, the average bounced back 50.90 points to close at 1975.30, its highest level since early November. Volume climbed to 276.2 million shares from 191.8 million Thursday as 1,290 issues advanced and 403 declined in price on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the busiest session since Oct. 30, when 303.4 million shares were traded.    Friday's &quot;triple witching hour&quot; provided most of the volume at the market's opening and closing as various stock index futures, index options and stock options expired. For the week, the industrial average was up more than 108 points, or 5.8%.    Nevertheless, there are signs of concern. Traders bid down the March futures contract on the Standard andamp; Poor's index below the closing price of the index, indicating that stocks may face selling pressure today.    Oil stocks gained on firming oil prices.    Mobil rose 1 1/4 to 37 1/2, Exxon was up 1 1/8 to 40, Chevron gained 1 1/8 to 38 5/8, and Atlantic Richfield was up 1/8 to 65 5/8.    Technology issues were among the most active. International Business Machines rose 1 3/4 to 117 1/4, Digital Equipment was up 4 5/8 to 138 1/4, Teledyne gained 8 3/4 to 313 3/4, Motorola rose 1 3/8 to 50 1/2, and Hewlett-Packard gained 1 1/4 to 56 3/4.    Among blue-chip stocks, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph rose 1 1/8 to 29 1/8, Boeing gained 1 5/8 to 37 7/8, Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing was up 2 5/8 to 64 3/8, Merck climbed 3 3/4 to 161, and Du Pont gained 2 3/8 to 83 1/8. </TEXT></DOC>
