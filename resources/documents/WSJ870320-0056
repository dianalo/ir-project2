By the hundreds of thousands they came, all of them looking for a better life. Six million European immigrants arrived in Argentina between 1860 and 1964, and they slowly drew the features of Argentina's 30 million population.    Today, however, their discouraged grandchildren are crowding the planes that will take them to more promising latitudes. Since 1960 approximately 601,000 Argentines have settled abroad, according to a report co-sponsored by the Center for Population Studies and the United Nations Institute for Social Development and Research. The most sought after destinations are the U.S., Brazil, Spain, Venezuela, Australia and Canada.    &quot;I will be out of work shortly; that's why I want to leave,&quot; says Ruben Arabean, a 30-year-old engineer, married with two children. As he waits in line for his immigration visa at the Australian Embassy, he explains: &quot;I want to live in a country where things are planned out, where the budget is approved at the beginning of the year, not at the end.&quot; While a television screen publicizes the bounties of Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, Mr. Arabean concludes: &quot;If I don't take the leap at 30, I'll never do it.&quot;    The diaspora craze is so pervasive that in September a consulting agency for potential emigrators opened its offices at the fancy Alvear Palace Hotel. Orientar, as the firm is called, publishes a $24 guide with 10,000 tips to get jobs, second passports and work permits in 26 countries. &quot;In less than two weeks we sold out our first edition,&quot; says Carlos Alberto Denari, Orientar's enthusiastic director. He explained that his firm also runs a computerized data bank connected to personnel agencies in the U.S. and Italy.    An unrelentless economic decline -- the legacy of several decades of corporate-statist presidents and military governments -- is the clue to understanding Argentina's new status as a breeder of emigrants. While there are encouraging new signs that Argentine policy makers may, at last, be recognizing the destructive qualities of a bloated, statist economy, those who are leaving need more substantive evidence of a change in the economy.    Argentina began to shed its population in the 1960s, after the full impact of Juan Peron's statist economy became manifest. Enrique Oteiza, a U.S.-trained engineer and social scientist who studied the issue at the time, concluded in a study titled &quot;Argentine Brain Drain&quot; that the emigration was a response to serious structural problems in Argentina: While the state universities produced thousands of professionals every year (tuition and admissions were -- and still are -- free), the economy made little use of them. Many important economic areas were, and still are, out of bounds for those professionals who had no entry into government bureaucracies (because oil, coal, gas, electricity, post office, railways, airways, communications and water supply are activities monopolized by the state companies). This created, and still creates, an academic lumpen-proletariat, forced either to evade the shrinking, formal economy by operating within the underground economy or to physically get out, which is another form of evasion.    Brutal left-wing terrorism, a &quot;dirty-war&quot; military reaction that stopped the chaotic aggression at a significant social cost and chronic three-digit inflation rates were the hallmarks of the 1970s. This grim decade saw an additional 248,000 Argentines leave their homeland, this time from all segments of society.    Of course, the return to democracy in 1983, and President Raul Alfonsin's commitment to halt inflation, slowed the urge to leave for a short time. But the increasing focus on the debt and uncertainty about the future of the economic &quot;Plan Austral&quot; -- particularly in light of the failure of the Cruzado Plan in neighboring Brazil -- have once again been pushing people out the door.    Recent statements from President Alfonsin's top advisers indicate that Argentina's economic planners seem much more willing to adapt to the realities of the marketplace than were Brazil's planners. Adolfo Canitrot, secretary of economics, was quoted this week as saying: &quot;An open market is the only acceptable way out for Argentina's problems and to achieve sustained growth.&quot; Other advisers have stressed the need for the state to get out of the productive sectors and manage only the essential services. However, to reverse the flow of emigration, the government must tackle some extremely complicated byproducts of statist management:    --Pensioners, who were forced to pay mandatory retirement dues to the state while in active work, are now obliged to survive on less than $70 a month. Years of regimes continually dipping into the social-security well for their own purposes have all but bankrupted the system. When the Supreme Court ruled that the state would have to pay senior citizens close to $25 billion (half the country's foreign debt) in delayed or underassessed pensions, the Executive declared a &quot;state of social-security emergency,&quot; because the money simply doesn't exist. President Alfonsin has expressed interest in starting a private social-security system.    --Argentina's informal (underground) economy may be as high as 60% of its GNP, a thorough analysis carried out by the Institute for Contemporary Studies revealed recently. This means that more than half of the population finds no incentives to produce and save within the legal economic system. Those disincentives that drive people out of the legal sector must be identified and eliminated.    --A terribly confusing and ominously progressive tax system (in which 36% of all tax revenue comes from 1,500 taxpayers) just gets worse. People continue to try every trick to avoid taxes while the government continues to increase taxes. Value-added tax evasion is estimated to be 70%. Out of 2,800,000 taxpayers, only 1,200,000 bother to file returns. Despite many tax-amnesty bills, the root causes of tax evasion -- regulation and excessive taxes -- are not attacked.    --The law of privatization is stalled in Congress, and, anyway, excludes the 11 &quot;Sacred Cows&quot; (the state monopolies). The new emphasis is on making state monopolies more efficient by creating an interministry holding company with &quot;really capable&quot; businessmen to run them.    --Nothing is done about federal expenditures -- they seem to be &quot;inelastic,&quot; as a government official said recently. Yet the public sees millions wasted in ways that become increasingly difficult to justify. For example, three of the four television stations are owned by the government, and two of those stations sustain a combined loss of $2 million a month. The private station makes about $1.2 million a month.    Yes, the winds seem to be slowly changing for the better. But the emphasis still seems to be misplaced. &quot;Enlightened protectionists&quot; say: &quot;Make the monopolies more efficient,&quot; without placing enough emphasis on deregulation and complete privatization. Until this is achieved, and a favorable socioeconomic environment is restored, people will go where it is simpler and more profitable to live. As a U.S. patriot once said: &quot;Where freedom dwells, there is my country.&quot;    ---   Mr. Helguera is a lawyer, economist and rancher from Buenos Aires. </TEXT></DOC>
