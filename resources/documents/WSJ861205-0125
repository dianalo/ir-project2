LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   PPG Industries Inc. expects an indicated 4.2% to 10% increase in net income for 1986.    Executives of the Pittsburgh-based glass, coatings and chemicals company told securities analysts here that for 1986 they expect earnings of $5.30 to $5.60 a share, or an indicated net of $315.4 million to $333.2 million, based on 59.5 million shares outstanding. In 1985, earnings were $302.7 million, or $4.54 a share, on the 66.7 million shares then outstanding.    Robert H. Mitchel, vice president and chief financial officer, also said the company expects record sales for 1986. Sales were $4.35 billion in 1985.    Mr. Mitchel added that PPG plans to further reduce its reliance on sales of commodity products and increase the share for value-added products so that by 1994, such commodity chemicals as chlor-alkali and related derivatives will account for about 28% of sales, compared with about 45% in 1985.    The executive said the company plans next year to introduce a new auto paint that will produce an improved finish.    Robert D. Duncan, group vice president-chemicals, told analysts that in looking for new businesses, the company is studying &quot;additional value-added niches such as pulp and paper chemicals, life sciences, and diagnostic chemicals.&quot;    Mr. Duncan also said that the company, as part of its overseas expansion, commissioned a study with Industrial Bank of Japan to &quot;identify and develop additional opportunities for growth in Japan based on our own technologies or technologies we can license.&quot;    While acknowledging that &quot;chemicals is a tough place to be,&quot; Mr. Duncan added that PPG believes &quot;that prices have largely bottomed out for major commodity chemicals.&quot;    &quot;Our long-range plans call for us to double our chemicals business within the next 10 years to something in the range of $1.8 billion, and improve our profitability significantly,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
