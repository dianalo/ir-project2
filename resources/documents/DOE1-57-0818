The rate-limiting step above 898{sup0}K in the formation of carbon deposits on iron is radical in nature.The analysis of the carbon deposits on carbon and hydrogen was carriedout by combusting the samples with the deposits in a quartz tube at 1150-1200{sup0}K in an oxygen atmosphere. The gases released were further combustedover cupric oxide and the combustion products were trapped by anhydrideand ascarite. Solid products were formed at the outlet upon passing benzenethrough the reactor heated to 973{sup 0}K. These products were analyzedby chromatomass spectrometry.</TEXT></DOC>
