Hutton andamp; Co.    Irving has traded currencies since the 1920s and is one of about a dozen U.S. banks with direct trading lines to the Federal Reserve. But since early April, Hutton has hired nine Irving dealers, including half the bank's spot currency trading desk. Like many other securities firms, Hutton is expanding aggressively into currency trading world-wide.    &quot;The spot desk was decimated. The (traders) left in a package deal,&quot; says Clement C. Cypra III, who joined Irving this week as vice president, New York trading. &quot;I was basically hired to rebuild the dealing room and the Irving name&quot; in the market, he says.    The personnel losses complicate Irving's plans to expand its lucrative New York foreign exchange business this year. Last year, Irving Trust had operating profit of $30.8 million from foreign exchange. Although that figure doesn't include salaries, taxes and other expenses, the operation is believed to have made a substantial contribution to the net income of Irving Bank Corp., the parent company.    Tony Chappell, Irving Trust's London-based senior vice president and head of world-wide foreign exchange trading, says the trading operation &quot;will continue to be profitable.&quot; The bank will still execute corporate foreign exchange orders during its absence from interbank dealing.    Mr. Chappell says: &quot;It's something of a setback if you lose quality people. But it's obviously a compliment if people come to us for quality people.&quot;    The departures began with Steven Martino Peras, the 30-year-old vice president in charge of Irving's spot desk. He joined Hutton in early April as senior vice president and global foreign exchange manager with the job of transforming the securities firm's modest currency trading operation into a world market force.    Mr. Peras insists that the departures that followed his weren't part of a package.    &quot;Initially I wasn't planning on taking that many people from Irving,&quot; he says. &quot;But people heard we were going to Hutton to set up something special, and they wanted to become part of the team. I know that for a team to work, there has to be camaraderie. I'd rather hire people I know.&quot;    Mr. Cypra, however, says higher pay offers provoked the moves to Hutton. In addition, several former Irving dealers say Irving's bonus plan often failed to deliver the kind of payoff its participants expected, as various overhead expenses were deducted from trading profit before bonuses were paid. In the industry in general, performance bonuses often exceed traders' base salaries. An Irving spokesman says that as a matter of policy, the bank doesn't discuss compensation plans.    Mr. Peras says money wasn't the deciding factor. He says he was attracted by the prospect of increased responsibility and the &quot;tremendous&quot; opportunity Hutton offered. &quot;The difference in pay was nominal,&quot; he says.    Irving is wasting no time trying to rebuild its foreign exchange department. Mr. Cypra says that after June 29, &quot;we'll be back into the interbank market in a more active way.&quot; Two traders have been hired to start at Irving Monday, he said, and another is due to join June 29.    Mr. Chappell says Irving hasn't notified its corporate customers of its withdrawal from the interbank market.    &quot;I don't think it's really relevant,&quot; he says. He says Irving is continuing to provide corporate customers with &quot;good prices,&quot; based on trading rates set by brokers and other banks.    Hutton's expansion is part of a surge by securities firms into the foreign exchange business, traditionally dominated by commercial banks. Several investment banks, including Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers, have asked for direct phone lines to the Fed, which is considering their request. Salomon Brothers said in its latest annual report that it traded a greater dollar volume of currencies last year than of equities, one of its longtime core businesses.    At Hutton, Mr. Peras says, &quot;there are more people coming on board as of Monday.&quot; By year's end, he says, Hutton plans to have 35 currency traders in New York alone, compared with a handful at present. He says he also plans to more than triple the London staff, to 20, and start a Tokyo currency trading desk. </TEXT></DOC>
