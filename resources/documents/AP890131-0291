KROPKO</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   BP America Inc. said Tuesday it is changing thename of its 7,400 U.S. service stations to ``BP'' by 1991 to betterreflect its status as the largest producer of U.S. crude oil.   The U.S. subsidiary of the London-based British Petroleum PLC nowoperates retail stations in 26 states under Sohio, Boron, Gulf andBP logos.   ``I think BP is in many ways the invisible giant of corporateAmerica,'' said James H. Ross, BP America president and chiefexecutive officer.   ``We are the major player in U.S. upstream oil, one of the mostsuccessful and innovative oil companies here and indeed worldwide.We are far bigger than houshold names in Ohio like TRW, Goodrich andSherwin-Williams,'' he said.   ``Upstream'' refers to the exploration and production side of theoil business, in contrast with ``downstream'' operations, whichrefer to refining and marketing.   Ross said BP America also has changed the names of its U.S.exploration, refining and marketing and chemicals businesses toreflect the BP label.   BP America operates about 750 service stations in the Northeastwhich are identified by the BP logo, with its green shield and twobright yellow letters. In addition, it has 1,100 Sohio stations inOhio, 600 Boron stations in Michigan and western Pennsylvania, and5,000 Gulf stations in the Southeast. BP America acquired the Gulfstations from Chevron Corp. in 1985 after Chevron purchased GulfCorp. and sold assets to avoid antitrust problems. It also recentlyacquired Mobil stations in three West Coast states that will convertto the BP brand.   BP America said it plans to redesign some of the service stationsaccording to a new format.   Ross said the company ``conducted extensive research, bothnationally and internationally,'' before deciding to unify itsbusinesses under one name.   He said use of the name ``BP'' in the United States would providethe company with a ``consistent identity.''   BP America, based in Cleveland, moved its headquarters from NewYork after the company purchased controlling interest inCleveland-based Standard Oil in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
