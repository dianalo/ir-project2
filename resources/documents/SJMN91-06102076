In recycling mowers, made almost exclusively by Toro, theclippings are cut up over and over until the pieces are extremely small.;   Either way, the grass needs to be dry and can't be excessively long for thesemowers to work well. They range in price from $299 all the way up to $600.;   (check) Shredders: Though they're not brand-new this year, the popularity ofshredder/grinders and shredder/chippers is growing.;    Once again, due tolegislation coming into effect, homeowners are wondering what to do with allthose branches and brush they've trimmed in the yard. Use these shredders andvoila, you have homemade mulch. They range from $600-$1,500.;    (check)Compost kits: Along those same environmental lines, compost kits are extremelypopular.;    With one of these kits, a homeowner can create a compost bin inhis/her own yard. It's a fairly simple solution to dealing with the yarddebris you soon won't be able to throw away. Kits average $10-$15.;    (check)Garden tools: Avoid those nasty blisters by using garden tools with cushionedhandles. These softer, larger handles can be found on shovels, rakes and handtools and make gardening a lot more comfortable. They range from $8 to $20,depending on the size of the tool.;    (check) Water/container gardens: Waterand container gardens are becoming more popular in yards this year, in somecases replacing traditional gardens.

Theyare, however, most welcome during the heat of the summer when their freedomfrom weeding is most noticed.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY JO MEIER, Scripps Howard News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910411  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  353  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 11, 199100102076,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
