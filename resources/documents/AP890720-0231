Zenith's Minisport, unveiled Wednesday, is the first computer touse a 2-inch-wide diskette, the smallest yet, for storing data. Mostcomputers still use 5\-inch diskettes, although the 3{-inch formatis increasingly popular.   Packaged software is not available on the Japanese-made 2-inchdiskettes, but users will be able to load programs into the portableby hooking it up to another computer or a device that handles biggerdiskettes.   Zenith spokesman Matthew Mirapaul said the Glenview, Ill.-basedcompany is not counting on the tiny diskettes to become a newindustry standard, although that may happen because they hold asmuch information in less space.   Portable computers are getting steadily smaller. Zenith's isheavier than NEC Corp.'s 4.4-pound Ultralite, which was announcedlast year, but it is also cheaper, starting at $1,999 vs. $2,999 forthe Ultralite.   Zenith claims a battery life of more than three hours for theMinisport, compared to about two hours for the the Ultralite. NEC'smachine has an internal modem, a device that permits communicationover phone lines, something that the Minisport lacks.</TEXT></DOC>
