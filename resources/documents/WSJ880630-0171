The correct answer is charisma (what else could it be?), and in the view of Ronald E. Riggio, an associate professor of psychology and the author of &quot;The Charisma Quotient: What It Is, How to Get It, How to Use It&quot; (Dodd, Mead, 224 pages, $16.95, $8.95 paper), &quot;each and every one of us has the capacity to develop our own charisma&quot; -- a noble and democratic sentiment in spite of its grammar.    Mr. Riggio's good news is that thanks to advances in the science of social psychology, we are now able to identify and measure the specific ingredients of the charismatic personality. This he proceeds to do, with charts that &quot;profile&quot; the constitutive elements of personalities such as John F. Kennedy's (top marks in four out of six categories) and Hitler's (low score for &quot;emotional sensitivity&quot;; Hitler &quot;was not,&quot; Mr. Riggio notes with some justice, &quot;a well-rounded charismatic personality&quot;).    Social science studies have a special zaniness all their own, deriving from the earnestness with which they use the methods of scientific inquiry to arrive at conclusions common sense has never doubted. &quot;The Charisma Quotient&quot; does not disappoint. &quot;Research has shown,&quot; we are told, &quot;that good-looking persons are better liked in initial meetings than are unattractive persons.&quot; And: &quot;Attractive persons are also more desirable as dating partners or possible marriage partners.&quot; (Readers who would like to know just how firm scientific consensus is on this point are referred in a footnote to E. Berscheid and E.H. Walster's monograph &quot;Interpersonal Attraction,&quot; 2nd edition, 1974.)    Mr. Riggio's difficulty is the difficulty faced by the first-century rhetorician Longinus when, in &quot;On the Sublime,&quot; he identifies sublimity in literature and oratory as the product of natural and supernatural ability -- &quot;the echo of a great soul&quot; -- and then sets out to explain how to achieve it. Charisma (a Greek word meaning &quot;gift&quot;) originally described someone touched by the Holy Spirit; when Max Weber appropriated the term to describe a type of secular leader, he did so specifically because of its magical connotation. So when Mr. Riggio writes that &quot;anybody can . . . enhance their {sic} charismatic potential through practice, dedication, and desire,&quot; he is not talking about charisma at all, since charisma by definition cannot be learned. What he is really writing about is the ingratiating, hail-fellow quality that some people cultivate to impress others. The word generally used to describe this quality is not Greek.    James C. Humes has chosen an easier problem in &quot;Standing Ovation: How to Be an Effective Speaker and Communicator&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 219 pages, $16.95). He has observed that &quot;Speakership is leadership,&quot; and he hopes to impart to less seasoned orators a little of the wisdom he has picked up in his years as a speechwriter and habitue of the banquet circuit. Mr. Humes loves an anecdote. &quot;Standing Ovation&quot; is a feast of stories about what Churchill said to Lady Astor and what a fifth-grade teacher said to President Ford, and the like, mildly seasoned with some unexceptionable advice about public speaking -- e.g., don't apologize for your ignorance; write for the ear not the eye; and &quot;In writing prose, repetition . . . is considered a vice. In speaking, it is a device&quot; -- counsel that might have carried more force had Mr. Humes not given it twice.    There are two great schools of thought about the use of language: the rhetoricians and the dialecticians. Rhetoricians such as Longinus and Mr. Humes regard language's power to move people as superior to language's power to convince people. They think (to invert Keats's dictum) poetry a finer thing than philosophy. Reid Buckley, the founder of the Buckley School of Public Speaking and an experienced controversialist, is a dialectician. He is also the younger brother of William F. Buckley Jr. Many people, he notes, have remarked a physical resemblance between the siblings; readers of &quot;Speaking in Public: Buckley's Techniques for Winning Arguments and Getting Your Point Across&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 239 pages, $17.95) will remark an intellectual resemblance as well.    Mr. Buckley offers -- in the course of a rambling account that takes in a good deal of his family history, oratorical adventures and various pet political peeves -- some introductory dialectical concepts. The premise of the dialectical tradition is that language, properly used, is the instrument of reason. The successful speaker triumphs by exposing the logical error in his opponent's case. Nothing gives Mr. Buckley greater intellectual delight than the elegant and dramatic uncovering of someone else's inconsistency. He therefore suffers from the dialectician's delusion that once you have demonstrated the philosophical incoherence of an idea, you have discredited the idea. The truth, however, is that there are many ideas and policies that work perfectly well in spite of being logically absurd, and many logically impregnable policies and ideas that don't work at all.    There is something dated about these books. They point to Ronald Reagan variously as successful leader, speaker and philosophical conservative; but these views of Mr. Reagan have lately become a little suspect, and in any case, the next election will feature two men who cannot be accused of either charisma or philosophical coherence. Those attributes are out of style. No wonder they're on sale.    ---   Mr. Menand teaches in the English department of Queens College. </TEXT></DOC>
