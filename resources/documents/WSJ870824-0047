A slowdown in energy price increases and a drop in food costs held the Labor Department's consumer price index to a rise of 0.2% in July, or a 2.9% compound annual rate, after a June increase of 0.4%, or a 4.3% annual rate. In the first half of the year, the index rose at a 5.4% annual rate, largely because of a surge in energy costs.    Separately, the Commerce Department trimmed its estimate of the economy's growth in the second quarter to a 2.3% annual rate from the 2.6% pace estimated last month. The revision in real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's total output of goods and services, occurred largely because the trade deficit narrowed less than the department estimated previously.    The Commerce Department also said that after-tax profits of U.S. corporations rose a healthy 4.2% in the second quarter after a 3.7% decline in the first quarter.    Economists were generally most impressed with the inflation numbers. The consumer price index &quot;looks super, just super,&quot; said Charles Lieberman, senior vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. &quot;There has been lots of fear of inflation, and none of it's borne out by the data.&quot; He and other economists predicted that energy price increases would remain modest in the next couple of months, barring a major supply disruption in the Persian Gulf. They noted that oil stockpiles have already been built up out of fear of trouble in the gulf.    Last month, energy prices edged up 0.1% after a 1.5% jump the month before. Natural gas costs were down 3.1% in July, while gasoline prices rose 1.1%.    Food prices fell 0.2% after a 0.7% rise in June. The Labor Department said the decline primarily reflected a turnaround in fruit and vegetable prices. &quot;It was clear that the food price run-up was going to run its course,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University.    Excluding food and energy, a calculation that many economists contend gives a better gauge of underlying inflation, the index rose a modest 0.3% after increasing 0.2% in June. Apparel prices, which rose sharply early in the year, fell 0.6% in July after a 0.8% drop in June. Transportation costs, including the increase in gasoline prices, rose 0.6% after a 0.5% rise.    For GNP, the revision to the trade data reflected a wider-than-expected merchandise trade deficit for June, Commerce Department officials said. For the quarter, imports increased considerably more and exports grew less than the department estimated.    &quot;The surge in oil and consumer imports in June is very troubling,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. But he said importers may have temporarily stepped up buying as a hedge against higher prices, and he predicted that a slow narrowing of the trade deficit would add to the economy's growth for the year.    The second quarter marked the third in a row that the deficit has narrowed.    Consumer spending and nonresidential business investment both increased from the first period.    In its revision, the Commerce Department left unchanged its estimate that a GNP-based price measure known as the deflator rose at a 3.8% annual rate in the quarter after a 4.2% rise in the first period.    After the revision, second-quarter GNP ran at an annual rate of $3.794 trillion, up from a $3.772 trillion pace in the first period. Before inflation adjustment, GNP ran at an annual rate of $4.448 trillion in the second quarter, up from a $4.378 trillion rate in the first quarter. The figures in all of the reports are adjusted for seasonal variations.    The rise in corporate profits brought them to an annual rate of $134.4 billion in the second quarter from a $129 billion pace in the first quarter. Before taxes, profits increased 3.9% to a $267.1 billion annual rate after rising 3.7% to a $257 billion rate.    The Commerce Department's measure of profits from current production rose 0.9% to a $296.5 billion rate in the second quarter after a 4.6% jump in the first period to a $294 billion rate. This figure, which many analysts consider a better gauge of corporate financial health, is adjusted to eliminate the effect of inflation on inventories and to reflect capital depreciation more accurately.    The department's measure of corporate cash flow fell 0.4% to a $365.8 billion rate after a 0.2% decline in the first quarter to a $367.3 billion pace.    The Labor Department said that before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index rose 0.2% in July and stood at 340.8% of its 1967 average, up 3.9% from a year earlier.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the broader index and is used in adjusting Social Security and retirement benefits, rose 0.2% in July after a 0.4% increase in June. Before seasonal adjustment, this index was up 0.2% to 335.6% of its 1967 average and was 3.9% above the year-earlier figure.    Separately, the Labor Department also said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 0.3% in July after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. These earnings dropped a revised 0.7% in June. Previously, the department said earnings fell 0.4% in June.    The latest figures reflected a 0.2% increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.3% decline in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $310.91 after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, down from $311.11 in June. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings fell to $311.85 from $312.20.
