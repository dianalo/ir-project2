Bulkeley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Nobody asked Bill Blocher to join the so-called Gang of Nine, the group of leading personal-computer makers that gathered in New York a few weeks ago to announce a new challenge to International Business Machines Corp.    But Mr. Blocher didn't mind. His business is thriving, with volume doubling this year as he churns out some 1,000 clones of IBM machines in the basement of his Bit Bucket computer store in Newton, Mass. &quot;If they'd invited people like me,&quot; he says, &quot;it would have been a mob, not a gang.&quot;    A year ago, the big computer companies were confidently predicting that little clone makers would be squeezed out of the industry. IBM had introduced a new standard, designed in part to thwart copycats. Manufacturers of name-brand IBM compatibles pushed their own prices down.    But the clone makers were able to slash prices even more, the old IBM standard proved firmly entrenched, and companies and individuals had come to feel increasingly comfortable about buying non-IBM equipment. As a result, Bit Bucket and hundreds -- maybe thousands -- of other &quot;no-name&quot; clone makers around the world are expanding instead. Their products, once used almost exclusively by hackers and engineering nerds, are now being bought even by blue-chip corporate giants.    The reason, of course, is money. &quot;We were paying top dollar&quot; for IBM personal computers, says Robert Obeiter, director of information systems at New England Electric System, a large utility in Westboro, Mass. Mr. Obeiter says that when he took the computer job last year, he asked, &quot;If you can save a couple of thousand dollars per unit, why not buy a clone?&quot; Now the utility gets its machines from Micro Smart Inc. in Ashland, Mass.    To be sure, not all clone makers are created equal. For every well-established operation headed by a Ph.D. computer scientist like the 34-year-old Mr. Blocher, there is one started by a college dropout who eschews such details as making sure the machines meet the Federal Communications Commission's radio-emissions standards. Quality can vary, sometimes from month to month.    Nevertheless, clones are increasingly prevalent as the better models gain respect. Bit Bucket's customers include publisher Houghton-Mifflin Co., defense contractor Raytheon Co. and telecommunications giant GTE Corp. Eastman Kodak Co. buys computers from MicroDirect Inc., a small Everett, Mass., clone maker. Many government agencies -- among them the Boston office of the Department of Transportation -- buy no-name clones.    William Lempesis, an analyst with market researcher Dataquest Inc. who tracks sales of 150 relatively well-known computer companies, estimates that other makers -- the no-names -- will ship some two million systems this year, up 11% from 1987. That would give them about 17% of the world-wide market for IBM-compatible machines, he says. (The no-names' dollar share would be far smaller, since their machines normally cost one-half to two-thirds the price of their name-brand equivalents.)    At the start, clones had a bumpy time of it. IBM successfully sued some early copiers of IBM personal computers who infringed on its patents. But by 1984, Phoenix Technologies Ltd. in Norwood, Mass., had designed a legal version of IBM's basic input-output system, or BIOS, a critical part of the computer. (Phoenix says it now sells 400,000 of these a month to no-name clone makers.) Around the same time, such semiconductor designers as Chips andamp; Technologies Inc. started to figure out ways to perform legally the functions of the chips in IBM computers.    There are now three major classes of clones, based on three Intel Corp. microprocessors. IBM stopped making its original PC when it launched the PS/2 family last year, but the older standard lives on.    The XT clones, which use Intel's 8086 or 8088 chip and copy IBM's first generation of products, now cost from $800 to $1,000 with a hard-disk storage device. The AT clones, based on the 80286 chip, cost $1,600 to $2,200. And the most powerful clones, based on the 80386 chip, cost around $3,000. Price and performance vary widely, depending on such details as the speed of the microprocessor, the capacity and speed of the hard disk, the amount of internal memory and the quality of the monitor.    Name-brand compatibles, such as Compaq Computer Inc.'s machines or the ones Tandy Corp. sells through its Radio Shack stores, usually have designs that differ somewhat from IBM's products. Clones, however, are exactly the same size and shape, and most parts are interchangeable with those of old IBM computers.    &quot;I recommend people buy clones so they aren't locked into one company for parts,&quot; says Edwin Rutsch, a San Francisco author of computer books. &quot;My first computer was a Sanyo, and it took two months to get a drive fixed. If I'd gone to a clone dealer, they would have swapped it out.&quot;    For most clone buyers -- especially corporations -- reliability and peace of mind are big concerns. Russ Walter, a Somerville, Mass., computer teacher, notes that &quot;just because you buy something from IBM doesn't mean it will work.&quot; But he points out that computer-store chains and name-brand computers do provide an element of security. &quot;If you buy an IBM and it doesn't work,&quot; he says, &quot;you figure you got a lemon -- they'll fix it. When you get a lemon from a mom-and-pop store, you say, 'Maybe the guy's a con artist.'&quot;    However, most clone makers offer one-year warranties, and users point out the general reliability of personal computers.    Mr. Obeiter of New England Electric System recognizes the IBM as a &quot;superb product,&quot; he says. &quot;But there's very little difference between that and many of the clones on the market.&quot; Losing IBM's vaunted service didn't worry him, either. &quot;On the personal computer,&quot; he notes, &quot;nothing really goes wrong.&quot;    Many clone makers sell only by mail. Mr. Rutsch, the writer, says that while shopping that way may be cheaper, people ought to buy locally if they can, because shipping broken products back and forth can be a nuisance. California, Texas and the Northeast are full of clone makers. &quot;In the San Francisco area, there are probably 100 dealers,&quot; Mr. Rutsch says, &quot;and I've only heard of two or three problems.&quot;    Other clone makers emphasize selling at computer shows. Among these is Tony Cole, a 25-year-old college dropout who founded VIPC Computers in Hayward, Calif. While Mr. Cole expects to build &quot;several hundred&quot; clones this year, he says that selling standard production models at shows is getting harder because more buyers are looking for custom features.    Then there are the real no-name computers, such as those made by Jean-Pierre Chelouche, a French-born hi-fi designer who assembles two or three machines a week in a spare bedroom at his San Francisco home. Mr. Chelouche says he can build and sell a high-power personal computer based on Intel's 80386 chip, with a high-resolution monitor and a 40-megabyte hard disk, for $2,600.    A comparable IBM PS/2 Model 80 with the same microprocessor has a list price of $6,995. And unlike Mr. Chelouche's price, that doesn't include delivery.    ---                    A Big Bite of the Pie    &quot;No-name&quot; clones are a considerable presence in the industry.
