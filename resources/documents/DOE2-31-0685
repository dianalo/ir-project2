Ilario Solar Test Facility, is a serious candidate to have anew, technologically close, technically and economically convenient applicationin the space field. The paper preliminary examines the characteristicsof some of the most significant projects and installations of solar thermalconcentration power systems for terrestrial applications. Specific designsand experiences on steam and gas solar plants and components developedby the S. Ilario Solar Test Facility and by ANSALDO are reported. A comparisonamong the various plant alternatives for use in solar dynamic power systems(photovoltaic, solar dynamic, nuclear) shows the existence of an intermediaterange of power where a potential exists for the use of solar dynamicsystems adopting parabolic dish concentrators and cavity receivers. Onthe basis of their experiences and of computer codes for parabolic dishsystems and cavity receivers, the authors give special attention to theproblems for the successful development of the dynamics conversion systemarising from the peculiar environmental conditions and from the particularrequirements on reliability, maintainability and lifetime, which affectthe components and system characteristics. A possible use of the thermo-solarorbiting converter, besides the electric power generation, could be,in addition, to satisfy thermal loads (melting, chemical reactions, heating).</TEXT></DOC>
