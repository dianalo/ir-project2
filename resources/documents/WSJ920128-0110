The nation's biggest brokerage firm rode the stockmarket's rally and the boom in stock and bond offerings.Merrill's full-year earnings, amounting to $6.02 a share,were 50% higher from its previous best year, 1988.</LP><TEXT>   Fourth-quarter net surged to $170.7 million, or $1.46 ashare, from a depressed $30.3 million, or 23 cents a share, ayear earlier. Revenue rose 12% to $3.12 billion from $2.79billion.   &quot;It's easy to get euphoric during very good times likethis,&quot; Merrill Chairman William A. Schreyer said. &quot;But we'renot euphoric; we're realistic.&quot; Merrill has been criticizedin the past for overstaffing and overpaying its employeesduring Wall Street's previous booms, and the firm's officialsare taking pains to avoid getting too giddy with the currentsuccess.   Merrill's results are the latest in a string ofblockbuster earnings reports from Wall Street brokeragefirms, including  Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Bear StearnsCos. and PaineWebber Group Inc. Even Salomon Inc., batteredby costs of its Treasury-auction bidding scandal, expects topost earnings of more than $500 million for 1991, thoughmainly as a result of profits early in the year, before thescandal broke in August.   Investors already were expecting good results for Merrill,and despite the record numbers the company's stock dropped$2.50 to $61.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Otherbrokerage stocks, most of which have taken huge leaps inrecent months, also eased.   Even Merrill officials don't know whether their firm, andWall Street in general, will be able to keep up theblistering earnings pace as the rest of corporate Americastruggles. So much of Wall Street's profitability is tied tochanges in interest rates and investor psychology, each ofwhich could turn for the worse at any time.   &quot;We've all learned a long time ago not to project out 12months,&quot; Mr. Schreyer said. &quot;I think we're going to haveanother good year, but at this point in the world in which welive, well, it isn't like projecting the sale of shreddedwheat. There's no way to know.&quot;   Merrill made its money in 1991 both in underwriting stocksand bonds and in trading for itself and customers.   It was the fourth consecutive year that Merrill was WallStreet's biggest underwriter. Its investment banking revenuesurged 48% to $1.18 billion, falling just short of the 1988record for the business.   With more individual investors returning to the stockmarket as interest rates plunged, Merrill's commissionrevenue from selling stocks, mutual funds, annuities andother products to customers rose 22% to $2.14 billion, thehighest level since the 1987 record. And Merrill generatedalmost as much revenue, $1.89 billion, trading junk bonds,stocks and other products for its own accounts. Its totalclient assets increased 17% to a record $435 billion.   But as with other profitable brokerage firms, Merrill'scosts jumped in 1991 along with its revenue. Compensationexpense rose 26% to $3.87 billion. Merrill noted, however,that its employees always make more in healthy markets; whentrading volume rises, so do commissions paid to brokers andbonuses for investment bankers. Compensation as a percentageof net revenue remained steady at 53.3%, normal by WallStreet standards.   Merrill said its overall head count is down 700 from 1990to 38,300 employees world-wide, even after adding 300 brokersand investment bankers to deal with the increased business.Daniel P. Tully, Merrill president, said the firm in 1992 andbeyond will have a &quot;continued commitment to cost control andtherefore head count.&quot;   Is Wall Street's success a leading indicator of the restof corporate America? Mr. Schreyer suggested it is.   He and other Merrill officials said that Wall Streetalready had its recession in the cost-cutting years after the1987 stock-market crash. Now the securities industry isreaping the benefits of leaner payrolls. &quot;We're all goingthrough the pain; a lot of companies have,&quot; he said. &quot;Givenany upturn in the economy, you'll see some amazing resultslater in the year from a broad base of American companies.&quot;   Merrill's biggest disappointment to analysts over theyears has been its mediocre performance as measured by returnon equity. Despite a goal of reaching at least 15% return,Merrill's return was only 5.8% in 1990. But in 1991,Merrill's return jumped to 20.8%, its highest since 1982.Book value rose to $35.75 a share, up from $29.97 a yearearlier, Merrill estimated.   Merrill's results showed how profit can gyrate from yearto year on Wall Street. Its net income for last year was 21/2 times the year-earlier's $191.9 million, or $1.59 ashare, earned during Wall Street's 1990 doldrums. Revenuerose 11% to $12.36 billion from $11.15 billion.   In the previous record year of 1988, Merrill earned $463.2million-though it gave back half of those gains the followingyear with a record loss of $213.4 million caused by the costsof a major restructuring.</TEXT></DOC>
