there is no installationprogram.andP;  This process is complicated if the user is also installing PersonalREXX for the first time (Personal REXX is required to use the scriptingcapabilities of Rexxterm).andM;The documentation is fairly well-written, although it is printed in a smallfont with wide margins, making it somewhat difficult to read.andP;  There are noscreen samples, but examples are given showing how to perform some commands.andM;The script language, as a function of Personal REXX, includes variables andarrays, looping and conditional control structures, error-trapping andinteractive debugging facilities.andP;  It is a complete programming language thatcan handle virtually any asynchronous automation task.andM;Rexxterm is not a Presentation Manager program, but it can be run in the OS/2character mode or in a Presentation Manager window.andP;  The main menu, which iscalled up by pressing Alt-Q, lets users walk through most commands.andM;Getting help from within Rexxterm can be frustrating: Alt-H pulls up the onlyhelp screen in the main program and can only be activated from the terminalprompt.andP;  It cannot be accessed from within one of the menus.andM;The built-in text editor has many basic features and can handle text files aswell as Rexxterm scripts.andP;  Help from within the editor is designated as F1.andM;Rexxterm is best used in an environment where a powerful script language isneeded.andM;Quercus Systems can be reached in Saratoga, Calif., at (408) 257-3697.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;One aspect of Rexxterm that buyers find unique and desirable is its supportfor the Zmodem file-transfer protocol.andM;&quot;When I bought Rexxterm, it was about the only product that supported Zmodemin protected mode,&quot; said Philip Eskildsen, treasurer of the Episcopal HomesFoundation Inc., a developer and operator of retirement-housing communitiesin Lafayette, Calif.andM;Pete Nielsen, a systems programmer for the University of California at LosAngeles, also praised the product's Zmodem support, which is not available inmany public-domain OS/2 communications packages, he said.andP;  &quot;It has Zmodem,CompuServe B and Kermit support,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Between these three protocols, Iget high-speed performance to all systems I need to communicate to.&quot;andM;Rexxterm has several other features that users like.andM;&quot;It has complete file-transfer functions, the ability to remap the keyboard,built-in file management, editor and browser facilities, and a menuing systemcallable from the scripting language,&quot; said Nielsen.andP;  &quot;I haven't seenanything in other packages comparable to this.andM;&quot;It may be worth making the point that Rexxterm comes in two pieces,&quot; addedNielsen.andP;  &quot;If you've just got Rexxterm, you'd get a competent OS/2communications package that's fairly feature-rich, but the script languagereally makes a difference.&quot;andM;The dynamic data exchange (DDE) protocol is one of the methods OS/2 uses totransfer data from one application to another.andP;  It operates behind thescenes, unseen by the user.andM;The classic DDE example is the communications program that downloads stockprices and sends them to a spreadsheet for analysis.andP;  Cawthon SoftwareGroup's ChipChat program and the OS/2 version of Microsoft Corp.'s Excel,both of which support DDE, could be used to carry out this task.andM;To initiate a DDE connection with ChipChat from within Excel, the formula=CHIPCHATCom2!TTY would be entered into a cell in an Excel worksheet.andP;  Thisformula tells Excel to place the information obtained from the ChipChatapplication with the Com2 topic name, using the TTY terminal emulation, intothe current spreadsheet cell.andM;As ChipChat receives data from the communications line, it is sent via DDE toExcel.andP;  A line of ASCII text terminated with a &quot;Return&quot; character thenappears in the Excel spreadsheet.andM;Without dynamic data exchange, having a communications program send data to aspreadsheet requires several steps and is far from dynamic.andP;  Extensivescripts and macros are needed to process the data in each application.andM;With DDE, this process is reduced to a spreadsheet formula.andM;While it may seem like just another industry buzzword, DDE's implications ina multitasking environment are enormous.andP;  With this protocol, diverseapplications have the ability to communicate with each other in ways neverbefore possible.andP;  -- David AlisonandM;OS/2 Extended Edition 1.2, which includes an updated Communications  Manager,began shipping in March, IBM  officials said.andP;  However, PC Week was unable toobtain a copy for review, despite repeated calls to the company.andM;Communications Manager 1.2 improves upon version 1.1 by supporting as  manyas 1,024 Advanced Program-to- Program Communications (APPC) sessions, SystemsNetwork Architecture  (SNA), asynchronous and X.25 gateways, and 5250terminal emulation, according to IBM officials.andM;It also shares with OS/2 Extended Edition 1.2's Database Manager and LAN Requester modules a new capability  called User Profile Management, which lets users share communications and databases on Extended Edition servers, and share basic files and printers on LAN  servers, the officials added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
