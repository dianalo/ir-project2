SCHMID</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Weriter</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dust plumes spewed out by volcanoes, longthought to cool the climate, may well have little weather effect, anew study contends.   ``Previous suggestions of large cooling during the first fewmonths after volcanic events appear to be unwarranted,''researchers Clifford F. Mass and David A. Portman say in the Juneissue of the Journal of Climate, published by the AmericanMeteorological Society.   Volcanic eruptions have often been blamed for cooling of theclimate in the past, based on the theory that the dust they injectinto the atmosphere would block sunlight and reduce the normalwarming of the land and sea surface.   Indeed, the cold weather in 1816, known to historians as ``theyear without a summer,'' has been widely blamed on a series ofvolcanic eruptions that occurred in various parts of the worldbetween 1812 and 1815.   In their study, Portman and Mass said prior analyses may havebeen confused by temperature changes that involve a periodicwarming and cooling of sea and air temperatures, a pattern known asthe El Nino-Southern Oscillation.   After subtracting those effects from the historical records,they concluded that ``only the largest eruptions are suggested inthe climatic record and that a modest cooling is observed for oneto two years after these large events.''   They defined modest cooling as about one-tenth to two-tenths ofa degree Celsius in average temperatures. That would amount to 0.2to 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   The authors found little hint of any effect on air pressure orrain or snowfall.   Considering that eruptions throwing dust into the air shouldinterfere with radiation from the sun, they asked themselves: ``Whyis the volcanic effect on surface climate so small?''   The answer, they concluded, amounts to an altered form of thegreenhouse effect _ the currently widely discussed threatenedheating of the planet.   ``Volcanic stratospheric aerosols can drastically reduce thedirect solar beam,'' they concluded, an effect which should lowerthe temperature by reducing the warming from the sun.   But at the same time these chemicals and dust also blockinfrared rediation from the ground and ocean what would normally beradiated back into space, cooling the planet.   Because volcanic clouds often shade only a small portion of thesurface and have only a negligible net effect on the radiationbalance, they result in little measurable climate change, concludedMass, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and Portman ofAtmospheric and Environmental Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass.   Records which seem to indicate cooling following eruptions couldreflect ordinary variations in climate, they conclude. In fact, amore detailed analysis of the records indicates that in some casesgradual cooling reported following eruptions had actually begunbeforehand.   As for 1816, Mass and Portman conclude that it was an unusuallycold summer in North America and parts of Europe, but the degree ofcooling was not unprecedented. The cold year could have resultedfrom consistent wind patterns bringing arctic air south, they said.   The greenhouse effect which has become a source of concern inrecent years results from an accumulation of carbon dioxide andother gases in the atmosphere, largely a result of burning fossilfuels and other industrial processes.   Like volcanic dust, these gases trap the earth's heat,preventing it from radiating out into space and cooling the planet.But unlike the volcanic dust, the greenhouse gases do not balancethings by blocking incoming sunlight.</TEXT></DOC>
