Takeshita's comments at a meeting of the Parliament's budgetcommittee reversed statements made previously before Parliament,when he denied ever receiving funds from Recruit Co., aninformation and publishing conglomerate.   Recent disclosures of Takeshita's financial links to Recruit andits subsidiaries prompted the prime minister to speak formallyabout his role in the stock profiteering and bribery scandal, whichhas involved about 160 politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats.   ``I am feeling political and moral responsibilities verystrongly,'' Takeshita said Tuesday. ``I think it is important tosettle this matter legally and politically.''   He said that between 1985 and 1987 Recruit donated 130 millionyen (about $1 million) to his political support groups in donationsand purchases of fund-raising party tickets. Japanese law allows acompany the size of Recruit to make political donations of $114,000a year.   Takeshita said the funds were handled strictly as politicaldonations and denied opposition claims that they were bribes.   ``Political donations are indispensible elements for vitalpolitical activities, which are said to be the foundation of ademocratic society,'' he said. ``But the widespread Recruit scandaland my position as a prime minister no longer allow me to speak insuch general terms.''   Opposition lawmaker Kanji Kawasaki of the Japan Socialist Partyasked Takeshita what his understanding of Recruit's intentions waswhen he accepted the money.   Takeshita replied: ``I am not in a position of telling theintent of another party's political donations.''   He also denied any personal involvement in transactions ofbargain-priced unlisted shares in Recruit's real estate subsidiaryby his personal secretary and a relative. The transactions producedabout $200,000 in profits when the share price soared afterover-the-counter trading began.   To opposition charges that he was reversing earlier statements,Takeshita said: ``I do not remember the details of my statement,but I probably did not have a clear recollections of the matterthen.''   Recent disclosures of the governing Liberal Democratic Party'slinks to the Recruit scandal have generated demands from thepolitical opposition that Takeshita resign and call elections toallow the public to give its verdict on the scandal. Even somemembers of Takeshita's own party want him to step down.   ``Your hand is contaminated with money,'' said Kawasaki of theSocialist Party. ``You must realize the ethics of Japan's democracyare being questioned. You should resign immediately.''   The prime minister has refused all demands that he resign,insisting he will stay in office to carry out political reforms.   Three people resigned from Takeshita's Cabinet afteracknowledging they had continued to receive Recruit donations afterthe scandal erupted last summer, but Takeshita said he did notreceive any funds from the firm after 1987.   So far, 14 people, including two vice ministers, have beenarrested on charges of violating bribery and securities laws inconnection with the Recruit scandal.   No politicians have been arrested, but prosecutors have begun toquestion politicians and their aides who received money or boughtstock from Recruit.   Public support for Takeshita has declined to its lowest levelsince public opinion polls on prime ministers began after the endof World War II in 1945. One poll released Monday showedTakeshita's approval rate at only 7.8 percent.   ``The public is not going to be satisfied with your explanationstoday,'' Kawasaki told Takeshita. ``I think the frustration andanger of the public is on the verge of blowing up.''   ``What we want is not an explanation from him (Takeshita) butthe act of responsibility by resigning immediately,'' YukihisaYoshida of the Democratic Socialist Party, another major oppositiongroup, said Monday.   Leaders of the Socialist, Komeito (Clean Government), DemocraticSocialist and United Social Democrat parties met last Friday inKyoto and agreed to continue pressing for Takeshita's resignation.They also agreed on an outline for a coalition government they hopemight replace Takeshita's administration if he steps down.   The combined opposition lacks sufficient votes in Parliament toforce Takeshita to resign or call elections.   But it has brought a complete halt to parliamentarydeliberations on the nation's budget for fiscal 1989, which startedApril 1. Before reopening debate, the opposition demanded thegovernment summon former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone totestify on his connections to Recruit, or alternatively that theentire Takeshita Cabinet resign.</TEXT></DOC>
