The horizontal stresseswere determined in three mines in the Yampa Coalfield and one mine inthe adjacent Danforth Hills Coalfield of northwestern Colorado. Stresseswere determined from stress-relief measurements using a three-componentborehole deformation gauge and overcoring techniques developed by theBureau. A least-squares method of calculating the average rock stresscomponents in the horizontal plane was performed. Physical propertiesof the rock from the test sites are also included.</TEXT></DOC>
