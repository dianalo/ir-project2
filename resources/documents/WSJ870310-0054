Woodbridge, N.J.-based Supermarkets General, the nation's eighth-largest food retailer and parent of Pathmark supermarkets and Rickel home-improvement stores, said only that it had received an unsolicited $41.75-a-share bid from an unidentified party. But Landover, Md.-based Dart said it made the bid in a letter sent late Friday to Leonard Lieberman, chairman of Supermarkets General.    In the letter, Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, Dart's chairman and president respectively, said they are &quot;most interested&quot; in completing the acquisition on a &quot;friendly basis.&quot;    Supermarkets General stock rose $6.875 to close at $41.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. It was the day's third-most active issue, with volume of 3.4 million shares.    Dart's bid is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and to a recommendation by Supermarkets General that its shareholders accept the agreement, according to the letter.    A source close to the proposal declined to say what Dart might do if Supermarkets General rejects its proposal. But he noted that Dart officials have met with Supermarkets General managers and a board representative several times in recent weeks, and that Supermarkets General officials seemed &quot;receptive&quot; and &quot;interested.&quot;    An unfriendly transaction might prove difficult for Dart. Last year, Supermarkets General adopted a poison-pill anti-takeover provision under which the company's shareholders would gain the right to buy common stock of a surviving concern for half price if the suitor acquired 20% or more of the company's common. Supermarkets General also elects directors to staggered terms, another takeover defense.    Analysts consider the company one of the best-managed food retailers. In recent years, it has focused on building its supermarket operations, acquiring two small chains and shedding its 23 department stores. In its fiscal nine months ended Nov. 1, Supermarkets General's net income fell slightly to $41.7 million, or $1.10 a share, from $42.1 million, or $1.18 a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 11% to $4.07 billion from $3.66 billion.    In its letter, Dart said it already has arranged financing for the proposed acquisition. It said its financial adviser, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., agreed to lend $750 million and is &quot;highly confident&quot; that it can place up to $950 million of senior debt in connection with the proposed acquisition.    Dart said it would finance the balance of the acquisition costs with its own funds. The source said Dart currently has more than $400 million in cash that it has accumulated on a number of transactions, including its unsuccessful hostile bid last year for Safeway Stores.    In recent years, sources say, Dart has also reaped large profits by buying stakes or making offers, sometimes both, in takeover situations involving Federated Department Stores Inc., May Department Stores Co., Jack Eckerd Corp., Revco D.S. Inc. and Beatrice Cos.    Since Dart hasn't yet made an acquisition, some analysts suggested that it may be more interested in putting Supermarkets General in play than in buying the company. &quot;The question becomes, do they want to become operating people in a major way, do they want to dismember the company or do they want to collect a nice mid-year bonus,&quot; said Jonathan Ziegler, an analyst at Sutro andamp; Co. &quot;On a historical basis, they've made money on the shares they own (by forcing) management to buy them out.&quot;    Robert Raiff, an analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., said he believes the Dart proposal could spur management to take the company private in a leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. To help finance an acquisition, any acquirer probably would spin off Supermarkets General's 45 Rickel stores, he said.    Dart has been accumulating Supermarkets General stock and currently owns about 1.9 million shares, less than a 5% stake.    Thomas R. Kully, an analyst at William Blair andamp; Co., wondered why shareholders should be interested in selling to Dart, which he said has had a &quot;highly inconsistent&quot; record in the retailing industry. He characterized the bid as &quot;a crazy kind of deal&quot; since, in his view, it involves &quot;a distinctly inferior company that has a lot of money trying to take over a superior company.&quot;    The source close to the proposal, however, said the Hafts want to buy Supermarkets General because they believe they can use their knowledge of the real estate business to build more large supermarkets and expand the chain quickly.    The source noted that, in their letter, the Hafts say they plan to offer management of Supermarkets General a chance to participate in ownership of the new company. The Hafts, the source explained, see themselves as &quot;builders&quot; who can increase the value of the company by complementing existing management.    The Hafts, through a limited partnership called Combined Properties, have developed more than 30 shopping centers that the family now owns in the Washington area and in Florida. The source said Combined Properties would become a part owner of Supermarkets General if the Dart proposal is accepted.    ---   Peter W. Barnes contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
