Six of the candidates _ all the Republicans and two Democrats _got ``failing'' grades from the group made up of 10 environmentalorganizations from southern states that held a two-day conferencein Atlanta.   The assembly graded Simon, a senator from Illinois, at 76percent on issues such as reducing use of toxic chemicals, cleaningup dumpsites and recycling waste.   But according to the study released Sunday, that grade onlyrates as ``fair.'' None of the Democratic or Republican candidatesscored in the ``good'' or ``excellent'' categories.   Republican candidates scored much lower than Democrats, withSen. Bob Dole of Kansas getting the highest score at only 18percent. Vice President George Bush was next at 8 percent, followedby Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, 4 percent, and former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson, 3 percent.   Among Democrats, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee trailed Simonwith a rating of 72 percent. Gore and Simon were the only twocandidates to appear at a forum Saturday before the assembly, whichfigured into their ratings.   Jesse Jackson was next at 64 percent, followed by Rep. RichardGephardt of Missouri, 60 percent; former Sen. Gary Hart ofColorado, 50 percent; and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, 47percent.   The assembly's report card said the grades were based on acandidate's ``past voting records, their written responses to ourquestions and their personal presentations'' to a toxic preventionconference.   Ninety to 100 percent was considered ``excellent,'' 80-89percent ``good,'' 70-79 percent ``fair,'' 60-69 percent ``poor,''and below 59 percent ``failure.''   Patty Frase, an Arkansas Enviromental Congress member whoattended the weekend conference, said the ratings show that the1988 candidates are not addressing environmental issues.   ``These candidates debate about many important issues, but theyneglect to address the environment,'' Ms. Frase said. ``How can wefocus on national defense when we can't defend our drinking watersupplies against chemicals that cause birth defects and cancer?''</TEXT></DOC>
