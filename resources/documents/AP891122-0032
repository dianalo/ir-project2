The shakeup in Givati Brigade came after Saturday's suicide ofEli Shahar, a brigade sergeant.   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, head of the army's southern command,decided the five soldiers ``are no longer worthy of serving in theGivati brigade,'' the army said in a statement on Tuesday.   The army said Vilnai removed Shahar's company commander from hispost and reprimanded a senior officer, who served as a regimentcommander. The five soldiers ousted from Givati are beinginvestigated by the military police, the statement said.   The suicide brought criticism from legislators and warnings thatthe harsh methods used to put down the 23-month Palestinianuprising were creeping into soldiers' behavior towards each other.   Shahar shot himself at a base in the Israeli-annexed GolanHeights on Saturday. The Givati brigade is often assigned to quellriots in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Shahar reportedlyhad asked for reassignment.   Israeli newspapers reported that the suicide was triggered byharassment from fellow soldiers during a mock trial staged topunish Shahar for removing his helmet during target practice.   Legislator Sarah Doron of the right-wing Likud bloc urged thatsteps be taken to prevent similar hazing incidents.   ``We have to ensure that such an ugly and dangerous thingdoesn't happen again,'' she said in a letter quoted by the YediotAhronot daily.   Initial findings of the army probe published by two newspapersTuesday show the soldiers roused Shahar from sleep for the mocktrial after being ordered by the company commander to give him a``motivation lecture.''   The unit commander entered the tent during the trial and broughtit to an abrupt halt, the Maariv daily said.   But the officer then reportedly ordered Shahar punished byserving two hours' guard duty wearing a helmet. It was after theorder that Shahar shot himself.</TEXT></DOC>
