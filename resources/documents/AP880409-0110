The state of emergency decreed Friday by the government ofPresident Jose Azcona, which gave authorities sweeping powers tocrack down on the demonstrations, brought a forced calm to thecountry.   Troops also patrolled the capital in light tanks and trucks.Military units guarded bridges, government ministries and keyintersections.   Radio and television stations were forced to suspend regularprogramming under the emergency order as authorities maintainedcontrol of broadcast outlets for the second straight day.   At intervals an announcer read communiques from the government'sinformation secretariat.   The government blamed Thursday night's attacks on the U.S.Embassy compound on what it called a small group of Marxistradicals. The mob, estimated at nearly 2,000 people, burned andsacked the U.S. consulate and offices of the U.S. InformationService, but did not penetrate the embassy portion of the complex.   Five people, all Hondurans, were reported killed Thursday night.The violence began with a student-led demonstration to protest thearrest Tuesday of accused drug trafficker Juan Ramon Matta and hisextradition to the United States.   On Tuesday, Honduran officials took Matta from his Tegucigalpahome in a pre-dawn raid and placed him on a plane to the DominicanRepublic.   Dominican Republic officials put Matta on a New York-boundflight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals.   Matta, held at the maximum-security federal prison in Marion,Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials for questioning in the 1985slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent,Enrique Camarena Salazar.   Some Honduran legislators called the handling of Matta a``kidnapping'' and the Foreign Ministry ordered an investigation ofthe procedures used.   The Honduran constitution prohibits the extradition of citizens.But Honduran authorities, working in concert with U.S. officials,seized Matta.   The two days of rioting was the worst anti-Americandemonstration in Latin America this year. Although the protestswere carried out largely by leftists who are regular critics ofU.S. policies, the extradition of Matta was seen by many as aflagrant violation of Honduran law.   Other anti-American sentiment apparently was fueled by thepresence in Honduras last month of 3,200 U.S. military personneldispatched after Nicaraguan government forces reported encroachedon Honduran land to pursue Nicraguan rebels, known as Contras. The3,200 U.S. troops returned to America within two weeks.   Many Hondurans oppose the presence of the bases of theU.S.-backed Contras in Honduras.   The disturbances that began Thursday continued Friday, withpolice using tear gas to break up concentrations of protestors.   Lawmakers, newspaper columnists and academics denounced Matta'sarrest. Government statements spoke in general terms of drugtraffickers and Marxists.   One said, ``The state's intelligence has detected a vast planthat terrorist elements serving foreign ideas, in conjunction withinternational drug traffickers, intended to carry out to sow chaosand disorder.''   Another said, ``We call on all sectors _ campesinos, privateenterprise, students and professionals _ so that the people,government and armed forces can together slam the door on thepenetration of Marxism-Leninism in our country.''   International drug dealers ``have reached the extreme ofthreatening to assassinate high officials of the republic and ofthe armed forces,'' a third statement said.   The government also said elements of the Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front were involved in the violence. Theleftist guerrilla group is waging a civil war in neighboring ElSalvador.   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy denied any guards at themission fired on the rioters Thursday night. The spokesman, whocommented on condition of anonymity, also said no U.S. agents tookpart in Matta's arrest.   Police sources in Tegucigalpa, who spoke with the condition theynot be identified, said two members of the U.S. Drug EnforcementAdeministration were present when Matta was seized.   The embassy spokesman said Honduran security forces delayed formore than two hours before going to the embassy compound to helpdisperse the rioters.   ``There were Honduran police in the area, sitting on theirthumbs. We have asked for an explanation at the highest level,'' hesaid. ``This is a matter of intense and urgent discussion.''</TEXT></DOC>
