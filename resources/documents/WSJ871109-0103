YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> DES MOINES, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   With 10 presidential candidates -- six Democrats and four Republicans -- campaigning across this Farm Belt state this weekend, it's no surprise that agriculture was a leading topic of conversation. What was surprising was the crop under discussion: marijuana.    Two Democratic candidates, Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, disclosed they had used marijuana as young men, which Mr. Gore likened to drinking &quot;moonshine in Prohibition.&quot; Their statements, triggered by Supreme Court nominee Douglas Ginsburg's disclosure that he had smoked marijuana, underscored the importance of the character question in this election.    The disclosures aren't likely to have the same impact as earlier revelations that led to the withdrawals of former Sen. Gary Hart and Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), political analysts say. Voters have a tolerant approach toward marijuana use by young people in the late 1960s and the 1970s, said Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker.    &quot;Most voters under the age of 40 have probably either tried pot or used it in some style.&quot; An older generation of voters, he added, handled the issue as parents.    Judge Ginsburg's name was withdrawn from consideration for the high court Saturday, but a Newsweek poll taken earlier showed that a large majority of those questioned didn't think a marijuana smoker should be disqualified from public office.    Further, by making their disclosures so openly, Messrs. Gore and Babbitt have reduced the likelihood that reporters will press them on the issue in the way the revelations about Messrs. Hart and Biden dogged those two as candidates. &quot;What's left to ask?&quot; said Robert Teeter, a Republican poll taker. &quot;They made a calculation to get it all out and over with.&quot;    Sen. Gore, 39 years old, said he smoked marijuana &quot;a few times&quot; between 1968 and about 1972, while he was a student at Harvard, an Army reporter in Vietnam, and a newspaper reporter in Nashville, Tenn. &quot;I wish that I had not,&quot; Mr. Gore said. He added: &quot;It wasn't a major part of my life.&quot;    Mr. Babbitt, 49, said he used the drug &quot;perhaps a half-dozen or a dozen times&quot; in 1966 and 1967 while he was an attorney for the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity in Austin, Texas. &quot;It didn't seem like a big deal at the time,&quot; Mr. Babbitt said. &quot;If I had it to do over again, I probably wouldn't do it.&quot;    Each of the four other Democratic candidates -- Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon -- said he'd never tried an illegal drug.    During appearances in Iowa over the weekend, four Republican candidates -- Vice President George Bush, Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and New York Rep. Jack Kemp -- said they hadn't tried drugs. Mr. du Pont noted that he randomly tests his campaign staff for drug use.    Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and the Rev. Pat Robertson, the other Republican candidates, weren't in Iowa over the weekend and didn't make statements on the marijuana issue.    In the spirit of disclosure, Sen. Simon, 58, told reporters that as a high school and college student he would &quot;sneak off with a six-pack of beer and really live it up. . .I hope that doesn't disqualify me.&quot;    Mr. Babbitt also was able to find humor in the situation. In his remarks to a Iowa Democratic Party fund-raising dinner, at which all of the Democratic candidates spoke, Mr. Babbitt said he and Mr. Gore had &quot;finally found an issue we can agree on -- it's called the statute of limitations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
