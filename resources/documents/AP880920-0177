It's difficult to say how manymore there could be. It could be very terrible,'' said DanielDimas, assistant information secretary for the Nuevo Leon stategovernment.   Dimas said by telephone that most of the bodies were being foundin the Santa Catarina River about 20 miles downstream fromMonterrey.   Earlier, authorities said about 100 bodies had been recoveredand estimated that 200 overall may have been killed in the flooding.   Rains unleashed by Hurricane Gilbert in the 14,000-foot-highmountains surrounding this state capital sent waters raging throughthe normally dry river bed on Saturday. The flash flood swept awayfive passenger buses and private vehicles that were traveling onroads built in the river bed.   The Santa Catarina divides Monterrey, which has a population of3 million and is the largest metropolitan area in northern Mexico.   The flash flood, the worst Monterrey has seen since 1909, alsoswept away squatters' homes, streets, electricity towers and milesof sports facilities that had built on the dry riverbed.   State authorities estimated damage at $90 million.   The torrent's destructive path extended for nearly 40 miles.Hundreds of homes were destroyed and thousands more flooded withwater and mud. About 30,000 people remained in shelters Tuesday.   Dimas said the fifth passenger bus had been located in the riverbed 30 miles downstream from here.   The bus is one of four intercity and one urban buses that wereswept into the river in Monterrey.   Army soldiers digging through rubble in the crushed andoverturned skeleton of the local bus found two decaying bodiesinside it on Monday, the daily Monterrey newspaper El Nortereported.   Dimas said ranches in the mountain region around Monterrey and avillage of about 100 families remained cut off Tuesday by floodingand mudslides.   ``We're trying to find out what we can do to get supplies tothese people,'' he said.   The flood waters, which were 10 feet deep and 150 yards wide,had subsided to a shallow trickle about 15 feet wide by Tuesday.   But many parts of the Monterrey area remained without waterbecause of damaged pumps.   Health authorities were recommending that citizens throughoutthe region boil water because of increased risk of viral andbacterial infections caused by contaminated water.   ``The water treatment plants are working beyond capacity,'' saidJorge Cavazos, state health secretary.   ``The water could be contaminated with fecal matter andsediments,'' he said in a telephone interview.   Apart from the damage and deaths in Monterrey and Mexico'sYucatan Peninsula, the storm killed at least 71 people anddestroyed thousands of homes in Texas, Jamaica, Honduras, theCayman Islands, Haiti and Puerto Rico.</TEXT></DOC>
