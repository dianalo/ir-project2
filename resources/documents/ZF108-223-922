demonstrationsof human resource, information retrieval and database management systems;and, the opportunity to &quot;touch and feel&quot; imaging technology in action.andM;&quot;We designed the forum so as to give something for everyone,&quot; said RichardCrutchlow, Oracle Canada's president.andP;  &quot;We were absolutely adamant not tomake this an elitist show.andM;&quot;As a result, we're seeing an interesting cross section of informationmanagers, systems professionals and, at the Ottawa show, senior-levelbureaucrats,&quot; he said.andP;  According to Crutchlow, sales opportunities withgovernment departments will increase this decade as officials search forcreative ways to &quot;do more with less.&quot;andM;One solution, featured at the Hewlett-Packard exhibit, is Oracle GovernmentFinancials, a recently-released family of accounting software packagesdesigned specifically for the public sector.andM;&quot;Like all our applications, Oracle Government Financials can be integratedwith Oracle Mail to enhance their functionality and further increasesavings,&quot; said David Martin, director of product management for the parentcorporations's office automation group.andM;Oracle Mail, on display at the Pyramid Technologies booth, is a distributed,open architecture e-mail system that allows both end-users and applicationsto communicate.andP;  When Government Purchasing is integrated with Oracle Mail,for example, the result is no more purchase orders to chase around thecorporation.andM;&quot;While Oracle Mail keeps everything on-line, the financial applicationautomatically figures out which terminal a half-completed P.O. should appearat next,&quot; said Martin.andM;Another cost-saving idea, adopted at Oracle headquarters in Belmont, Calif.,andO;is to integrate Oracle Mail with an in-house inventory system.andP;  &quot;It used tobe that I'd have to wade through a weekly report if I wanted to keep track ofthe products used in my department,&quot; said Martin.andP;  &quot;This was very inefficientbecause half the time I couldn't be bothered.andP;  As a result, we sometimes ranout of certain items and had to wait four to six weeks to restock them.andM;&quot;Now an e-mail message automatically pops up when an item falls below thereorder point.&quot;andM;Across the aisle from the Oracle Mail exhibit, Monenco Information Systemsunveiled one of four new imaging technologies available for the Oraclerelational database market.andP;  Monenco's product, an image storing system,enables users to mix photographs, signatures and documents within a singledatabase.andP;  Designed for a number of environments including banks, passportoffices and real estate firms, SQL Image and SQL Signature arehardware-independent.andM;Another popular exhibit featured an image processing application calledGuardCard, by Groulx and Associates of Hull, Que.andM;With the aid of a video camera, GuardCard systems capture a person's image onan electronic tablet, then combine the image with a signature, bar code, textand company logo into a full color identification card.andM;The process takes four minutes and gives the card bearer immediate access toany door, gate, room or system serviced by the GuardCard security network.andO;The application uses Oracle relational database software on a 386 PC XT.andM;According to Crutchlow, products like these place Oracle ahead of itscompetitors.andP;  &quot;A year ago, Wang was the only player doing anything reallysignificant with imaging,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But in the last few months alone, ourVARs have released some very exciting stuff.&quot;andM;Whether the company's lead in imaging and other applications will continue isanybody's guess, conceded Crutchlow.andP;  &quot;It's a tough market out there, noquestion about it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
