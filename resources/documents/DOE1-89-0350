The reserves in oil fields can be formulated byusing several parameters such as an effective layer thickness ratio,a porosity, an oil saturation ratio, and so on. By the Monte Carlo method,one value of the reserves is calculated by using one value which is random-sampledfrom the probability distribution of each parameter. The same procedureis repeated to give the probability distribution of the reserves havinga some dispersion width. The effectiveness of the calculation resultsdepend on the probability distribution of input parameters. For thispurpose, triangular distribution is often used. This method is effectiveparticularly in giving a certainty to reserves having many factors ofundeterminedness. In the case of the parameters in mutual-dependencerelationship, a function representative for the parameters is used togive a high precision probability distribution of an objective parameter.In the case of a lot of data, the data are multi-layer sectioned to givea multi-layer model. By using the multi-layer model, the results havinga narrow dispersion width can be obtained. It is necessary to improvethe probability distribution of parameters through the amount of dataand the characteristics of oil formations. (11 figs, 1 tab, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
