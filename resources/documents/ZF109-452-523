 Major companies, includingNEC, Novell, Frontline Distribution, Amstrad and Epson, have failed to bookinto the 1991 exhibition.andP;  In addition, they have publicised their withdrawaland disappointment with the show's results.andM;The show has been criticised for targeting the wrong audience, for being heldat the wrong time and for lacking promotion.andP;  For Amstrad's exhibitions andevents co-ordinator, John Taylor, the show was just held at the wrong time.andO;&quot;The move to April was a bad one,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;By that time, everyone hasalready made their buying decisions.&quot;andM;However, the problems the show's organisers Reed Exhibitions are now takingon may just be a symptom of the computer industry's desire to change itsmarketing tactics.andP;  Reed has admitted that it must undergo a seriousre-evaluation of the Which Computer?andP;  Show in order to secure its future.andP;  Ithas commissioned a survey from Romtec, the UK market analyst, which willaddress the needs and compalints of last year's exhibitors as well as theviews of industry users.andM;When the results are published, Reed will announce new proposals for the 1991exhibition and outline a five-year plan to refocus the entire exhibition.andO;But a lot of work is needed to persuade anxious exhibitors to once againinvest their time and money in the show.andM;The cost of attending a show can be phenonmenal.andP;  &quot;A company can easily spendits entire budget on exhibitions,&quot; says Novell's UK marketing manager, FionaMaktari.andP;  As well as paying for the stand, exhibiting companies have to takepeople away from their usual jobs, run the stand and advertise theirattendance.andP;  Epson, for example invested 350,000 [pounds sterling] in the1990 Which Computer?andP;  Show.andM;Exhibitors expect very high returns, with a minimum of double their costsconsidered acceptable.andP;  But Epson, NEC an Novell have claimed they weredisappointed with the sales and audience in 1990.andP;  &quot;We need to be sure thatthe organisers are going to put in a high level of research and promotion, toget the quality audience we want,&quot; says Maktari.andP;  But she doesn't feel thiswas the case at the Which Computerx  Show 1990.andM;Which Computer?andP;  Show exhibition director Hugh Keeble does not concede thatReed is to blame for rising expenses.andP;  &quot;We are aware that many exhibitors arespending too much on coming to the shows.andP;  But we sure that it is possible toattend cost-effectively,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;The floor space was 179 [poundssterling] per square metre this year.andP;  This translated into a 12 per centincrease in exhibitor costs this year, despite a 19 per cent increase in thecost of hiring the NEC,&quot; he adds.andM;Amstrad's exhibitions co-ordinator John Taylor argues that it is Reed'sresponsibility to keep down costs.andP;  &quot;The popularity of the Which Computer?andO;Show caused it to become like an auction.andP;  The take it or leave it atmospheremeant that we were forced into making decisions very quickly,&quot; he says.andM;Hugh Keeble, the exhibition's director, has pinpointed budget cuts inexhibitors' marketing departments caused by tough market conditions as partof the reason why companies are pulling out.andP;  However, Novell, Epson andAmstrad all claim that they have suffered no cuts in next year's budget.andO;Instead they claim their position is based on a review of all exhibitions anda close scrutinisation of less-explored possibilities.andM;The most popular shift is towards the small niche-market shows.andP;  Theattraction of such shows is the finely tuned marketing that becomes possible.andO;The audience may only be 3,000 or 4,000-strong, but if it is only interestedin one specific area, exhibition organisers can promise the exhibitors a moresecure payback.andM;According to Simon Lubin, Epson's publicity manager, it can cost less toattend these events.andP;  &quot;Although the stand space per square metre is probablyno cheaper, you don't need such a big stand to make an impression,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;Niche events also stand a better chance of keeping up to date with marketchanges.&quot;andM;Once companies have achieved a high level of company and product branding atlarge shows, they can begin to concentrate on getting themselves known in newmarkets.andP;  &quot;New companies need to gain exposure at shows.andP;  At niche shows weare one of the new companies,&quot; says Lubin.andM;Despite the hit and miss experiences of some exhibitors at large shows, manyare unwilling to forfeit the showcase platform altogether.andP;  In tight markets,such as the one the computer industry is facing now, the opportunity to meetclients face to face remains important.andP;  The question companies are nowasking themselves is whether the Which Computer?andP;  Show, or even any othershow in the UK, can offer the level of European exposure currently providedby the Hanover Fair.andM;Hugh Keeble believes it can.andP;  &quot;We recorded 1,000 visitors from abroad at the1990 exhibition,&quot; he says, while still underlining his belief that eachcountry needs a major local exhibition of its own.andM;The refocus plan will move the show away from being a solely end-useroriented event to one that is tailored for corporate users, which could givea greater incentive for European involvement.andP;  &quot;We intend to compete with allother exhibitions on a trade level.andP;  It will be the principle forum in whichUK industry meets European dealers,&quot; says Keeble.andM;At meeting in September, Keeble and his team will have their last chance topersuade some of the major players in their exhibition to reverse theirdecisions.andP;  The changes to the 1991 Which Computer?andP;  Show will have to bedrastic in order to hold on to the big exhibitors that have made it a winnerin the past.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
