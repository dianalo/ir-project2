The lowerestimate raised the possibility that the United States actually could make aprofit on the war.;    &quot;The costs of the war will be greater than thecontributions by a considerable amount,&quot; Fitzwater said.;    Fitzwater said itwas still too early to know what the war's final price tag would be.;   Waigel promised Monday that Germany's full $6.5 billion pledge would be paidby Thursday, as cash continued to roll in toward the $54.5 billion in alliedcommitments.;    But he called on U.S. officials for a strict accounting withan eye toward a partial rebate of Germany's share if the allied contributionsprove to be more generous than necessary.;    According to the latest tally,nearly half of that total -- $26.6 billion -- has been paid. The two largestdonors, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are expected to fully pay their pledges,which total more than $16 billion each.;    But congressional budgetofficials, citing the short duration of the war and the unexpectedly lowlosses in equipment, say the cost of Operation Desert Storm will be closer to$40 billion.;    If that figure proves accurate, the government may not needthe $15 billion in taxpayer dollars appropriated last week by Congress in abill that awaits President Bush's signature.;    In fact, if a strict standardis used to gauge direct costs of the war, the Treasury could wind up withmoney left over.;    There is agreement that the tab for moving troops andequipment to the gulf and home again should be counted, as well as the cost oflost airplanes, tanks and other equipment, and for spent ammunition, missilesand bombs.;    Other costs, however, are in dispute. For example, should thePentagon be able to claim higher fuel costs due to the war's impact on oilprices? Should the figure include wear and tear on equipment or any delays inthe planned reduction in the military's size?;    And what about money doledout to allies as compensation or rewards for their help? About $7 billion inmilitary debt from Egypt has been forgiven; Israel is receiving an additional$650 million and Turkey stands to receive $200 million extra.;    &quot;We aresuspicious about some of the Defense Department's costs,&quot; said one CapitolHill budget analyst who requested anonymity.;    The prospect that the UnitedStates could reap a windfall from the war already has angered the Germans.Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week questioned whether his nation's full pledgeshould be paid.;    But after a 3 1/2-hour meeting Monday with TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady, Waigel promised that Germany would pay the $1.7billion balance of its pledge later this week.;    Waigel said Brady hadassured him the final tally of war costs would be &quot;certainly more&quot; than the$42.6 billion Congress approved in last week's emergency spending bill.;    InTokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said his country will not boostits war pledge to make up for $400 million lost through changing currencyexchange rates. In January, the Japanese pledged 1.17 trillion yen, or $9billion at the time. But the yen has weakened against the dollar since then,making the pledge worth only $8.6 billion.;    One congressional official saidlawmakers were operating at a disadvantage because they had to rely onincomplete Pentagon estimates for some figures. &quot;We don't have any data ontonnage shipped, hours flown by aircraft or miles put on tanks in training,&quot;said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.;    The Pentagon arguesthat not only those costs but the long-term bills for veterans' pensions andmedical care could legitimately be ascribed to the war. Gen. Colin Powell,chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said the total will run closer to$60 billion or $65 billion, in excess of allied contributions.;    Inaddition, the Pentagon points out that troops are being withdrawn slowly, andthat the need for a U.S. presence in southern Iraq could continue for months.;   It may be months, as well, before full cost information is available. TheDefense Department must make a full accounting to Congress under legislationapproved before lawmakers adjourned last week for their Easter recess.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910326  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  800  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 26, 199100086186,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
