They hope to sendthe message that the threat of war is real and that the result willbe devastating.   It's not that Iraq's leaders believe President Bush is bluffing,the diplomats say. They recognize there's a danger of war. But theyremain confident they can outlast the threat, the sanctions and theinternational coalition aligned against them.   ``We're trying to convince them that it's real and imminent,'' aWestern diplomat said. ``We're trying to show them what they'refacing. We're walking around talking to the walls, telling themabout B-52 strikes.''   ``We talk about our own fears and hope the message is passedalong'' to President Saddam Hussein's inner circle by the Iraqiintelligence agencies bugging them.   Saddam will not back down or withdraw from Kuwait as long as hebelieves he can withstand the embargo, break the international willbehind it and forestall attack with clever hostage releases andbehind-the-scenes deals, the diplomats contend.   The diplomats argue that Saddam now cannot afford to invadeKuwait and then just cave in to international pressure.   The Iraqi people are already questioning why they fought foreight years with Iran only to give all the gains away after theinvasion of Kuwait.   So, the diplomats say, he plays for time, dealing with hostagesand hinting to visiting delegations that perhaps, just perhaps,there's a chance to talk, to negotiate.   Iraq's plan to release all its hundreds of foreign hostages inbatches between Christmas and March 25 is cited as an example ofhow Iraq believes it can forestall attack.   Iraqi officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, candidlyadmit that the threat of war is the highest between late Decemberand March and that the hostage release is a manuever to delay Bushand weaken the American resolve to attack.   The officials say they have tried other means, includingattempts to talk with the Americans through back channel diplomaticcontacts. But they say the Americans have never responded.   People on the street in Baghdad seem less afraid of war thenthey did in late August and September when the allied troop buildupin Saudi Arabia was just beginning.   ``There will be no war. America is a great country, a countrythat cares for its people. It won't waste their lives in a war,''said one Baghdad resident, who asked to be identified only asYousef.   His sentiments were repeated often by other Iraqis and by someIndian and Moroccan workers who have elected to stay at their jobsin Iraq despite the crisis.   Some Western diplomats say the public has been lulled to sleepby the Iraqi propaganda machine that daily prints stories ofgrowing opposition to war in America and the West and growing worldsupport for Saddam and the cause of peace.   But other diplomats say that many in Iraq, who have benefitedfrom some of Saddam's policies, are convinced he is a cunning andclever man who will prevent the war and survive the crisis.   ``This is a republic of fear, no doubt,'' said one Asiandiplomat. ``But it's also a country where the common man hasbenefited greatly. It's not a pyramid standing only on fear ofSaddam Hussein.''   Despite the economic sanctions - spot shortages of some goodsand soaring prices for others - many Iraqis believe the crisis isonly a short-term inconvienence.   ``America will never go to war over Kuwait,'' said one Baghdad,who gave his name as Ahmed. ``Why should it?''   For the most part, it's business as usual in Iraq. There arenoisy wedding parties outside the big hotels and celebrations forprisoners of war repatriated from Iran.   ``They know Iraq is a potentially very rich country,'' the Asiandiplomat said. ``It's sitting on the world's second-largestreserves of oil.''</TEXT></DOC>
