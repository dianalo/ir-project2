The Denver oil and natural gas concern said the transaction calls for it to pay an undisclosed amount of cash and 850,000 Class A common shares in exchange for the properties in Wyoming, Louisiana and Texas. Presidio has about 11.4 million fully diluted Class A shares, which carry one-twentieth of the voting rights of its Class B shares.    Standard is a unit of BP America Inc., the U.S. affiliate British Petroleum Co.    Presidio said the purchase will more than triple its oil reserves, while adding natural gas reserves in areas where it already owns properties. The transaction is expected to close Oct. 4. </TEXT></DOC>
