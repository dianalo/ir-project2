A department spokeswoman, Deborah Burstion-Wade, said the FBI hadreceived two complaints from civilians who were in Virginia Beach,the scene of rioting among a crowd of 100,000 youths over the LaborDay weekend.   Police and National Guard troops used clubs to disperse thecrowds, which largely consisted of students from predominantly blackEast Coast colleges.   Burstion-Wade said the FBI and the department's civil rightsdivision had formally opened a criminal investigation into possibledeprivation of civil rights.   The spokeswoman said she couldn't provide specific informationabout the two complaints against law enforcement officers that werefiled today with the FBI.   The Justice Department was continuing to review publishedaccounts and videotapes of police and National Guard troops clashingwith the rioters, she said.   Virginia Beach's mayor said earlier that she welcomed a federalinvestigation into how the city handled the disturbances.   ``I have nothing to fear in this city being open to scrutiny,''Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf said Tuesday. ``We want the opportunity tohave our name cleared.''   Other city officials joined the mayor in supporting the police.   According to perliminary counts, 1,235 people were charged with1,346 offenses. Most of the charges involved disorderly conduct,traffic offenses and public drinking.   The rioters early Sunday and Sunday night were mostly blackcollege students attending the annual end-of-summer Greekfest. Atleast 43 people were injured, including 30 police officers orNational Guardsmen.   ``These statistics do not even begin to tell the story. Whenyou're in the middle of a riot, you don't have time to make arrests.Your main concern is to get the streets secured,'' said Police ChiefCharles R. Wall.   ``These officers were exposed to an extreme situation,'' CityManager Aubrey V. Watts Jr. said. ``It's incredible that they wereable to restore law and order without firing a single shot or usingfatal force.''   Watts said a city team will evaluate the millions of dollars indamage, much of it attributed to looting, caused by a crowd of about100,000 young people who attended the annual event known asGreekfest. He also said he will gather reports from police, fire andemergency personnel.   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., said he has alerted the U.S. SmallBusiness Administration to be ready to process requests for disasteraid from more than 100 businesses damaged.   Merchants and innkeepers said they would meet to discuss how toavoid similar problems at next year's Greekfest.   ``You can't do a whole lot,'' said Rick Kowalewitch, owner ofRK's Windsurf Shop on 17th Street. ``No matter what we do we looklike a racist.''   Many of the young people who were chased off the streets bypolice were black, but Kowalewitch said he and other whites wereordered around by police as well.   Greekfest participants were divided about whether they wouldreturn.   Brad Williams, 23, of White Plains, N.Y., said he has enjoyed thegathering for five years and will come back.   Muriel Steptoe, 26, and Alicia Dailey, 25, of Springfield, Mass.,said they would not return because of the disturbance this year.   ``If anybody comes back next year I think it will be the ones whowant to make trouble,'' Ms. Steptoe said.</TEXT></DOC>
