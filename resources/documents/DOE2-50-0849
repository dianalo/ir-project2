Directly- and indirectly-dated stratigraphic, sedimentary,and geomorphic evidence documents recurrent late Quaternary eolian activityas well as the timing and severity of episodic aridity during the Altithermal.Eolian activity in the Ferris-Lost Solider area began under cool andarid conditions by the late Pleistocene. Radiocarbon-dated dune and interdunestrata reveal that Holocene sand dune building at Ferris-Lost Soliderpeaked between ca. 7660 and 4540 years b.p. The first phase of dune buildingwas the most extensive and lasted until ca. 6460 years b.p. Warm, persistentlyarid conditions during this time favored active dunes with slipfaces,even in historically well-vegetated locales subject to high water tables.Increased effective moisture from ca. 6460 to 5940 years b.p. promoteddune stabilizing vegetation; but renewed dune building, lasting untilca. 4540 years b.p., followed this climatic moderation. Subsequent duneand interdune deposits reveal a return to climatic conditions where onlysporadic and localized dune reactivations have interrupted overall dunestability. The most significant recent reactivation, probably associatedwith a regional decrease in effective moisture, occurred ca. 290 yearsb.p.</TEXT></DOC>
