The Commissionis publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changefrom interested persons.<ITAG tagnum="85">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>The American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``AMEX'' or ``Exchange'') proposes toexpand its automatic execution system (``AUTO-EX'') to forty equity optionson a pilot program basis until permanent approval is obtained to expandthe system to all equity options.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rulechange and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change.The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified inItem IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries,set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significantaspects of such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule ChangeThe Exchange proposes to expand the application of its AUTO-EX system toforty equity options on a pilot program basis. AUTO-EX is an automatedexecution system that enables member firms to route public customer marketand marketable limit orders in options for automatic execution at the bestbid or offer at the time the order is entered. If the best bid or offeris on the specialist's book, the incoming order is routed to the specialist'spost where it is executed against the book order, thus assuring publiccustomers' orders on the book retain priority over orders in the crowd.If the best bid or offer is not on the specialist's book, the contra sideof the AUTO-EX trade is assigned on a rotation basis to either one of theAMEX Registered Options Traders (``ROTs'') who have signed on the systemor to the specialist.Each specialist in an AUTO-EX eligible option is automatically signed onto the system, while ROTs participate on a voluntary basis. Prior to signingon to the AUTO-EX system, ROTs must sign an agreement with the Exchangeundertaking to satisfy the following requirements prior to and during theirparticipation on the system. A ROT:1. Must be in good standing at the AMEX;2. Must have the written concurrence of his or her clearing firm to participateon the system;3. Once signed on the system for a given option class, must remain in thetrading crowd for that option. The ROT may, however, sign on to one additionalAUTO-EX option class so long as the ROT can be considered in the crowdfor both options;4. May sign on the system at any time during the day, but may only signoff and back on the system one additional time during the day;5. While signed on the AUTO-EX system in a given option class, may notplace orders on the specialist's book for that option; and6. Must accept Exchange-mandated price adjustments when a trade is automaticallyexecuted at an incorrect price.Since its initial implementation in December 1985, AUTO-EX has been extendedto: (i) Full-time use in selected series of Major Market Index (``XMI'')options, (ii) use during periods of extremely high order flow in stockoptions and (iii) use in selected competitively traded stock options.\1\<NOTE/> Overall, member firms have been supportive of these variousapplications of AUTO-EX and the Member Firm Advisory Committee, representingthe major wire houses, has urged the Exchange to make AUTO-EX more generallyavailable for stock options.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23544, dated August 27,1986, approving SR-AMEX-86-16 for use of AUTO-EX on a permanent basis inXMI options; Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24228, dated March 18,1987, approving SR-AMEX-87-4 to use AUTO-EX during emergency situations,subsequently extended until June 30, 1988 (see SR-AMEX-88-1); and SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 24714, dated July 17, 1987, approving SR-AMEX-87-19to use AUTO-EX in competitively traded options on a 90-day trail basis,subsequently extended until June 30, 1988 (see SR-AMEX-87-26 and 88-6).On October 9, 1987, the Exchange filed a proposal to expand the AUTO-EXsystem to all equity options on a full-time, permanent basis.\2\<NOTE/> While this filing continues to await SEC approval, the Exchangeproposes to expand AUTO-EX to forty equity options on a pilot program basisand continue the pilot program until a decision is reached regarding permanentapproval to expand the system to all equity options.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 25056 (October 23, 1987), 52 FR 42164 (File No. SR-AMEX-87-26).The Exchange believes the expansion of the AUTO-EX system to forty equityoptions and the eventual expansion floorwide is necessary for it to continueto offer the level of service that member firms and their customers require,while remaining competitive with other marketplaces. The AMEX believes the proposed rule change is therefore consistent withsection 6(b)(5) of the 1934 Act, which provides in pertinent part, thatthe rules of the Exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principlesof trade and to protect the investing public. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The AMEX believes that the proposed rule change will not impose a burdenon competion. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others The AUTO-EX Ad Hoc Committee, a committee of the AMEX Board of Governorscomprised of members and representatives of member firms, has endorsedthe proposed rule change. No written comments were either solicited or received. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action </ITAG>The AMEX has requested that the proposed rule change be given acceleratedeffectiveness pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, so that the Exchangecan begin using the AUTO-EX system on select equity options while awaitingpermanent approval to expand the system to all equity options. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a securities exchange, and in particular, the requirements of section6 and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission believes thatthe proposed rule change will benefit public customers by affording thema more efficient method of executing small market and marketable limitorders in the forty equity options selected than was previously availableat the AMEX. Specifically, the Commission previously has approved, on apilot basis, the use of AUTO-EX in equity options during emergency or breakout situations. The AMEX's experience for these options has been that AUTO-EX'savailabily enhances order execution and brings operational efficienciesto the trading post during these emergencies.\3\<NOTE/> Extension of the system to forty options will allow the Commissionand the AMEX to monitor in a more comprehensive fashion the operation ofAUTO-EX until a final decision on permanent approval is reached. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See The October 1987 Market Break. </T3>A Report by the Division ofMarket Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (February 1988).The Commission understands that the AMEX plans gradually to introduce AUTO-EXto additional equity options and that it does not expect to bring AUTO-EXup in all forty options immediately. The AMEX believes that operation ofAUTO-EX in up to forty additional equity options will have no adverse impacton the Exchange's system capacity. In this regard, the AMEX has representedthat currently all option orders are routed to the appropriate post throughthe Exchange's PER/AMOS order routing system, regardless of whether AUTO-EXis available. After arriving at the appropriate specialists post, the ordermust be executed either automatically, through AUTO-EX, or printed outand executed manually. The use of AUTO-EX will not increase the numberof messages being processed through the AMEX's automated order routingsystems, Currently, these systems have a capacity to process 18 messagesper minute, which is 4\1/2\ times the peak one minute message traffic receivedon an average day and 3\1/2\ times the traffic experienced on the businesstrading day ever experienced at the Exchange.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See, </T3>Letter from Paul Stevens, Executive Vice President, AMEX,to Howard L. Kramer, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation,SEC, dated April 8, 1988. Finally, the Commission notes that the operation of AUTO-EX in these optionswill not negatively affect public customer limit orders because these orderswill receive the customary limit order protection afforded public customerorders placed on the book.The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changeprior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filingthereof in that the Exchange previously has demonstrated the operationalefficiencies of AUTO-EX for an extended period. In addition, approval ofthe proposed rule change will keep the AMEX competitive with other marketplaceswith similar automatic execution systems. Moreover, the Commission previouslyhas solicited comments on AUTO-EX on four separate occasions, two of whichspecifically covered its application to options on individual securities,and has not received any adverse comments on AUTO-EX or its usage in optionson individual securities. Finally, the Commission's approval is limiteduntil the AMEX receives permanent approval to expand AUTO-EX to all equityoptions.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
