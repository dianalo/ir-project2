Shultz that his country will not stand in for thePalestinian people or the PLO in proposed Middle East peace talks,the government said Friday.   Shultz, who visited Jordan this week as part of a shuttlemission to push the talks, has suggested that a team of Jordaniansand non-PLO Palestinians negotiate for Palestinians.   The official Jordan News Agency said King Hussein gave Shultz a``working paper'' of Jordan's principles for peace with Israelduring their three days of meetings. Shultz returned to Washingtonon Friday.   The secretary of state vowed to return and praised Hussein for``having engaged seriously with us for peace in the region.''   The Jordanian paper laid out six general principles calling forIsraeli withdrawal from occupied territories, self-determinationfor the Palestinians, and an international Middle East peaceconference to include the five permanent members of the U.N.Security Council: the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, Franceand China.   The paper contained major differences with the Shultz peaceplan. Israel and the United States reject the idea of Palestinianself-determination, which implies statehood. The U.S. plan offerslimited self-rule for Palestinians.   Jordan has attempted to repair its tattered relations with thePalestine Liberation Organization, whose prestige has increased inthe Arab world because of a four-month wave of violent protestsagainst Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``Jordan will not represent the Palestinian people in that(international) peace conference and will not negotiate asettlement on the Israel issue in place of the Palestine LiberationOrganization,'' the paper said.   Shultz said in Israel and again in Jordan that the PLO could nottake part in peace talks unless it renounces violence and acceptsIsrael's right to exist.   Jordan said it is willing to attend the peace conference in ajoint delegation with Palestinians ``if the concerned parties agreeto this principle.''   The PLO, obviously one of the ``concerned'' parties, hasrejected the idea of a joint delegation.   Jordan said the international conference should be more than an``international gathering aimed at starting direct negoations,'' areference to Shultz's concept. But it left unclear the extent towhich the conference would affect talks between warring states.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel opposes anyinternational conference, arguing it would be stacked against hiscountry. He also opposes any proposal to surrender the West Bank,Gaza Strip and Golan Heights captured by Israel in 1967 fromJordan, Egypt and Syria.   Shultz told Shamir he would have to give up some territory toachieve peace, but did not favor the total withdrawal the Arabsdemand.   Jordan said peace talks must be based on ``the illegality ofoccupying other peoples' lands by force,'' wording taken fromUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which calls onIsrael to trade the captured lands for peace.</TEXT></DOC>
