In a televised news conference, Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahrisaid the CIA had ``carried out acts of terrorism and sabotage inIran, including assassinations of high-ranking officials,'' theIslamic Republic News Agency reported. The dispatch was monitoredin Nicosia.   ``These spy networks were organized by the United States toinfiltrate the Islamic Republic system and divert the revolution inthe next decades,'' Reyshahri said.   IRNA quoted him as saying the Iranian agents had been recruitedby the CIA ``mainly from those Iranians calling at U.S. embassiesabroad for various purposes such as obtaining visitors visas to theUnited States.''   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said last week hehad no information on the Iranian allegations. ``They make similarclaims every once in a while about American spies when they need alittle attention,'' he said.   Reyshahri said the agents all were linked to a CIA base atWeisbaden near Frankfurt in West Germany. He said West Germany andan unidentified neighboring country of Iran cooperated with the CIAin the operation.   Reyshahri identified 20 of the alleged agents, seven of themofficers in the armed forces. He said they were only some of thosewho had been arrested.   Among those named were three senior naval commanders who,according to unconfirmed reports from Iranian dissidents, wereexecuted in early April for plotting to overthrow the government.   Reyshahri identified them as Commodore Kianoosh Hakimi, Capt.Ghahreman Malekzadeh, and Capt. Touraj Riyahi.   Reyshahri did not say whether any of the accused agents werestill alive or if they had been executed.   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who broke the news aboutthe arrests on Friday, said all the alleged agents were still aliveand under interrogation.   Though Resyhahri did not name the neighboring country accused ofcooperating with the American spy operation, he read from thetestimony of one alleged agent who said they were taken fortraining to another country via Turkey.   He said agents in the armed forces had given the CIA informationabout Iranian naval movements in the Persian Gulf during theeight-year Iran-Iraq war.   Reyshahri said tens of agents had been arrested and that otherarrests would follow in the coming weeks, IRNA reported.   But he said that if the agents identified themselves beforebeing caught, their sentences would be shorter.   Responding to a question from an Iranian reporter, Reyshahrisaid the Iranian intelligence service, known as SAVAMA, learnedabout the alleged CIA network in 1985, but that the arrests weremade only a few months ago.   The alleged agents all passed lie detector tests before beingrecruited and were given regular annual training in espionagetechniques, including the use of codes, development of photographicfilm, and use of special radios and cameras, Reyshahri said.   He said equipment used by the alleged agents, such as specialphotgraphic film and cameras were imported into Iran packaged asmedicine.   The agents allegedly reported to the CIA about Iranian militarysites, number of personnel in the armed forces and governmentoffices, and military and civilian flight routes, Reyshahri said.   Reyshahri named the head of one of the alleged networks asMasoud Dalvand, IRNA reported.   Among the others was a Foreign Ministry expert on legal affairs,Bahman Aqaei, and another lawyer, named Manuchehr Azar.   Two other spies included Masoud Bidvar and Jamshid Amiri, bothemployed in the oil industry.   The only clergyman among the group was identified asHeshmatollah Maqsudi.</TEXT></DOC>
