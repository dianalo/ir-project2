Harris Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BA EUROP </CO><IN> AIR ARO </IN><TEXT>   Boeing Co. said Lufthansa German Airlines ordered 20 Boeing 737 aircraft for a total of $535 million, and took options that could bring the value of the transaction to more than $1 billion.    The Seattle-based commercial aircraft and defense contracting concern said the 20 planes Lufthansa ordered on a &quot;firm&quot; basis are 98-seat 737-500s and 125-seat 737-300s. The planes are scheduled for delivery between October 1990 and the end of 1991, Boeing said.    The options taken by the West German airline involve 20 additional aircraft of the 737-300 and 737-500 types.    Lufthansa, which was Boeing's first customer for the initial 737 program launched in 1965, currently flies 58 of the twin-engine Boeing planes. With 2,028 sold to the world's airlines, the Boeing 737 is the largest-selling commercial aircraft ever. Lufthansa has both the 737-300 and older 737-200 models in its fleet.    The latest order gives a boost to Boeing's marketing of its smallest jetliner, the 737-500. Under that program, launched last year, Boeing now has sold more than 100 planes.    Both the 737-500s and 737-300s in the latest order will be powered by CFM56-3B engines made by a consortium including General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn., and Snecma, the French engine concern.    In Toulouse, France, a spokeswoman for the European consortium Airbus Industrie said there &quot;certainly wasn't head-to-head competition&quot; behind the latest Boeing order placed by Lufthansa, which is controlled by the West German government. The Airbus spokeswoman said Lufthansa has needed to add to its 737 fleet or replace older 737s, and noted that even when Lufthansa ordered larger Airbus A-320s two years ago, it bought 737s at the same time.    For Boeing, the latest order continues a strong showing in its commercial transport business so far this year. The company said airlines now have purchased 128 aircraft valued at a total of $4.6 billion, compared with 55 planes valued at $3.38 billion at this time last year. Last year's orders included more of Boeing's most expensive plane, the 747 jumbo jetliner.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing shares closed at $47.375, down $1.125. </TEXT></DOC>
