The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said 12 of its13 member nations sold 17.87 million barrels a day of oil lastmonth, which was 362,000 barrels above the ceiling in place at thetime.   The cartel said in a statement Wednesday carried by its newsagency, OPECNA, that June figures were not available for the UnitedArab Emirates.   The emirates, a persistent cheater on production accords, had asupply quota of 988,000 barrels a day last month. It was raised inthe new agreement to 1 million barrels.   A new accord went into effect July 1, lifting the production capfor all 13 nations to 19.5 million barrels a day in the last halfof the year. It had been 18.5 million barrels in the January toJune period.   Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York,estimated OPEC production in July was running close to 21 millionbarrels a day.   He said the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were producing morethan their share, and that Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 crudeexporter, was a bit above its supply cap.   The new output accord, fashioned at a June meeting of oilministers, was designed to keep a firm grip on production so thatprices would remain robust. It left the target price at $18 abarrel.   But prices began tumbling last week, partly reflecting aweakness in demand for gasoline.   Other factors, including the ending of the coal strike in theSoviet Union, have also contributed to the decline, analysts say.The resolution of the miners' walkout eased fears the unrest couldspread to the oil sector.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September futurescontract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude,was trading at $18.30 a barrel. Oil prices had been in the$20-range just over a week ago.   Oil supplied by the OPEC nations is generally priced severaldollars below the American brand.   To meet the July-December ceiling, some OPEC nations would haveto slash their production. Analysts estimated output had picked upin early June to about 21 million barrels a day.   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly OilMarket Report that OPEC production in June was 21.3 million barrelsa day, the highest level so far this year. The report was releasedin early July.   The energy agency, which is part of the Western nations'Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, predicteddemand for OPEC oil would be about 20.9 million barrels a day inthe second half of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
