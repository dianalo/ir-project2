Still, he is willing to face such buyer resistance if itmeans cleaner air. &quot;Environmental protection has been movingtoo slowly,&quot; he says, &quot;much slower than the pace at whichwe've been polluting the planet.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   As major new clean-air legislation makes its way throughCongress, Americans are increasingly being asked to makesacrifices in the name of the environment. And according to anew nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, a majority,like Mr. Medeiros, say they are by and large willing to makethose tough tradeoffs in order to have a cleaner world. Thereason is that as Sunday's 20th anniversary of Earth Daynears, people are far more likely to be worrying thancelebrating.   The survey, covering 1,001 respondents, indicates that afull two-thirds of registered voters think the environment isin worse shape today than it was 20 years ago. By an evenmore overwhelming ratio of six to one, voters say they wantto protect the environment even if it means they will have topay higher prices. That is a sea change from 1981, when theratio was only five to four.   &quot;Americans are playing for keeps when it comes to theenvironment,&quot; say pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter, whoconducted the sampling for the Journal and NBC. &quot;Everyindicator in this survey suggests that voters care about theenvironment, that they are personally making efforts toprotect the environment and that they are willing to changetheir behavior and purchasing habits in order to ensure thatwe have a cleaner world.&quot;   More than eight of 10, for instance, say they are willingto separate their trash for recycling, give up plasticfast-food containers and superfluous packaging to reducewaste, and get their cars inspected and tuned up yearly tocut tailpipe emissions. By three to one, voters say theywould favor a ban on disposable diapers.   In addition, 68% would be willing to pay up to $600 morefor a less-polluting car; 57% favor stricter air-pollutionrequirements even if these added $10 a month to theirelectricity bill; 57% also would favor requiring urbancommuters to ride public transportation to work once a week;and just over half, 51%, would be willing to see limitsplaced on the number of large cars that could be produced.   Robert Cashon, a 56-year-old retired engineer inHuntsville, Ala., is disturbed by the television images ofsevere air pollution in Eastern Europe and worries that theworld faces a &quot;slow death&quot; from pollution. He suggestsAmericans should make sacrifices so the U.S. can serve as amodel for other polluting nations. &quot;I think business peoplehave done a lot to really abuse and rape the land from wayback,&quot; he says. &quot;The bottom line is all they know.&quot;   Adds Cindy Pittman, a 32-year-old office clerk in Kent,Wash.: &quot;I just figure I'm pretty young now and I've got along way to go. I want to protect it for myself and my kids.&quot;   Of course, people might have second thoughts about some ofthe tradeoffs if actually faced with the prospect of havingto make them. For instance, the poll found that even 56% ofthose with children under age three favor a ban on disposablediapers, a figure that might drop significantly if thisbecame a real possibility.   Along the same lines, Gene Manzone isn't sure customersappreciate the new pollution equipment he has alreadyinstalled at his New Bedford, Mass., service station,including new pump nozzles that catch gasoline fumes. &quot;I cantell them prices are going up to help clean the air that theybreathe, and they'll go down the street to save three cents agallon,&quot; he says.   Yet the poll findings are important in showing how peopleview the issue. &quot;They indicate how strongly people would liketo believe they are part of the move to improve theenvironment,&quot; say Mr. Hart, a Democrat, and Mr. Teeter, aRepublican. The environment has seemingly transcendedpolitical debate; it has almost become socially unacceptablenot to be concerned about it. When voters are asked to ratethe importance of environmental protection on a 10-pointscale, 72% give it an 8, 9 or 10.   There are limits to people's good environmentalintentions. The Journal/NBC poll shows that 59% opposeclosing polluting factories if that would put people out ofwork, while voters are evenly split over a 20-cent-a-gallonincrease for cleaner-burning fuel, a prospect that could be areality for the nine smoggiest U.S. cities under theclean-air bill passed by the Senate.   By far the most difficult tradeoff, in the poll as inpeople's lives, is the one between pollution and jobs. TheSenate legislation would force industry to spend, by oneestimate, up to $21.5 billion a year by the year 2005 toclean up the atmosphere, and it would almost certainly costthousands of jobs in coal mines and possibly factories.   Though the bill isn't even law yet, it has already claimedits first victims. About 45 miners of high-sulfur coal atPittsburg-Midway Coal Mining Co. in economically depressedsoutheast Kansas are out of a job; the mine closed when itsonly customer, a utility based in Joplin, Mo., took earlysteps to reduce emissions blamed for acid rain and switchedin December to cleaner-burning Wyoming coal. &quot;Plenty of coalremains, but we have no market for it,&quot; says Fred Meurer,spokesman for the Kansas coal company.   While voters in the Journal/NBC poll are worried about joblosses because of new environmental regulation, six in 10 ofthem think it not very likely or not at all likely that theirown job will be either directly or indirectly affected; aboutone-third think it very or somewhat likely that they will beaffected.   The tradeoffs go well beyond job losses. For instance,Congress is considering a ban on methyl chloroform by theyear 2000 because the widely used solvent is damaging theatmosphere's protective ozone layer. But there's currently nogood replacement that is as safe for workers and will performas well in some applications. One such use is cleaning theends of wire rope used in bridges, on cranes -- and to catchjets landing on aircraft carriers. &quot;It's extremely importantthat {the cable} be perfectly clean&quot; to allow a solid weld ina socket, says Mike Catino, vice president of engineering atPaulsen Wire Rope Corp. in Sunbury, Pa. If a cable pulled outof a socket on a carrier, he says, &quot;you would drop a $30million aircraft into the ocean.&quot;   In Ashland, Ky., the choice may come down to healthier airor competitiveness. Clean-air legislation threatens to wipeout the pricing edge gained by an Armco Steel Co. plant whenit inaugurated a new $60 million thick-slab caster lastmonth. Considered the salvation of the aging mill, the casteris expected to cut slightly more than $20 a ton off the costof making steel at Ashland. But tough new pollution-controlmeasures being proposed for coke ovens could add back that$20 a ton.   There will be ripple effects as well. To pay for reducingemissions blamed for acid rain, for instance, AssociatedElectric Cooperative Inc. in Springfield, Mo., expects toraise its electricity rates as much as 20%. The co-op'sbiggest industrial customer, a Noranda Aluminum Inc. plant inNew Madrid, Mo., says that because of market pressures itwill have to swallow the extra $15.5 million a year itself.And that could cut the annual profit-sharing check that RickMiller, a 37-year-old smelter employee, has come to count on.   For unionized plant workers, the check can mean a bonus of$8,000 on top of wages of $24,000 to $28,000. &quot;My profitsharing went into CDs for college for my children,&quot; frets Mr.Miller, who has three teen-agers. Moreover, &quot;if the company'sprofit dropped, it's gonna make it tougher to get a raise outof them&quot; in the next contract negotiations.   The poll found that no single environmental issuedominates the debate. Toxic waste, air and water pollutionand garbage were the ones most often cited. But in Medford,Ore., for instance, the issue of whether new clean-air ruleswill require sharply higher emissions fees from localindustry pales before concern over whether the federalgovernment will designate the northern spotted owl as athreatened species. That could put large tracts of federaltimber off-limits to loggers.   &quot;If there's no timber to cut, we're not going to have toworry about additional fees,&quot; says Larry Gill, an engineer atMedford Corp., which makes plywood and veneer.   The Journal/NBC poll found that many voters haven't yetfocused on the clean-air legislation and the tradeoffs itwill require; only about four in 10 voters have heard or readabout the bill so far. Yet the intensity of environmentalfeeling is such that there's little evidence more attentionto the bill will make them change their minds. In fact, ofthose who do know about the bill, 40% think it doesn't go farenough, while 33% think it has about the right balance andonly 6% think it goes too far.   While the poll found that 45% believe the quality of airin their communities is about the same as it was 20 yearsago, three times more people think it has gotten worse thanthink it has gotten better. In terms of overall environmentalprotection, 45% feel the U.S. is doing better than most othermajor countries, 37% say about the same and 13% think theU.S. is worse.   People don't view the environmental issue in very partisanterms. Democrats have an edge of just 22% to 14% as the partypeople think handles the environment better; nearly half ofthose polled see the two parties as the same on the issue. Incontrast to their high regard for President Bush in otherareas, voters approve of his environmental record by only 49%to 41%, which may reflect more on their worry about theproblem than on concerns about specific Bush actions orpolicies.   Another mark of how seriously people view the environmentis their report in the poll of how their concerns arechanging their daily lives and consuming habits. Seventy-sixpercent say they have changed the kinds of products they buyand use because of environmental concerns. By largemajorities, they say they already recycle their newspapers,bottles and aluminum cans, and conserve water, electricityand natural gas at home. But as for taking car pools orpublic transportation to reduce driving, more don't than do.   One who has adapted his life more than most to live inbetter harmony with the environment is Pat Stone, 40, aformer assistant editor at Mother Earth News magazine. Hespent money to equip his home in rural Fairview, N.C., withsolar panels, extra insulation and special windows toconserve energy. He grows organic vegetables for the familydinner table and raised four children in cloth diapers.   Yet there was one tradeoff even he couldn't make. Toaccommodate his large family, he drives a gas-guzzling 1983Buick station wagon that he bought used for $3,000 because hecouldn't afford a new model with gas mileage possibly twiceas good.   &quot;You can't lead an environmentally pure life in thisworld,&quot; he says. &quot;The only way to act is to do what you can.&quot;   ---   Additional reporting for this story was done by thefollowing Dow Jones Ottaway Newspapers: The DailyIndependent, Ashland, Ky.; The Daily Item, Sunbury, Pa.; TheGlobe, Joplin, Mo.; The Mail Tribune, Medford, Ore.; and TheStandard-Times, New Bedford, Mass.   ---                   The Greening of America                                                                                                          &quot;SOMETIMES THE LAWS that are designed to protect theenvironment cause industries to spend more money and raisetheir prices.
