<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-0969 </DOCNO><TEXT>A general method for the preparation of high-quality, mostly ice-crystal-artefact-freewhole human brain hemisphere sections is described. Upon receipt, hemispheresare divided; one is then fixed in buffered 10% formalin for neuropathologicalanalysis while the other is cut in 8-10-mm-thick coronal slices thatare then rapidly frozen in 2-methylbutane at -40 degrees C (10-15 sec)before being placed in the brain bank at -80 degrees C. Such rapid freezingmarkedly decreases the formation of ice-crystal artefacts. Whole-hemisphere20-micron thick sections are then cut and mounted onto lantern-type gelatin-coatedslides. These sections are subsequently used for both qualitative andquantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography. Examples of data obtainedare given by using various radioligands labelling classical neutrotransmitter,neuropeptide, enzyme, and ion channel receptor binding sites. This methodshould be useful for the obtention of various receptor maps in humanbrain. Such information could be most useful for in vivo receptor visualizationstudies using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. It could alsoindicate if a given receptor population is specifically and selectivelyaltered in certain brain diseases, eventually leading to the developmentof new therapeutic approaches.</TEXT></DOC>
