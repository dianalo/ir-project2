The development of hybrid instrumentswith commodity-related components has raised questions concerning the statusof such instruments under the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act'')and Commission regulations. The proposed rules would establish an exemptionfrom CFTC regulations under the CEA for hybrid instruments with limitedcommodity option components, based upon the limited nature of the optioncomponent and deference to other existing regulatory standards applicableto the noncommodity component of such instruments. In addition, the proposedrules would establish a notice requirement for hybrid instruments qualifyingfor the proposed exemption. The Commission is also publishing, in a companionrelease, a statutory interpretation that is intended to clarify the statusof certain other categories of hybrid instruments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date:</T2> Comments must be submitted on or before February 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address:</T2> Comments should be submitted to the Office of Secretariat,Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC20581.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> Robert Rosenfeld, Attorney, Divisionof Trading and Markets, telephone (202) 254-8955, David Merrill, SeniorAssistant General Counsel, telephone (202) 254-9880, or Eugene Moriarty,Director, Research Section, Division of Economic Analysis, telephone (202)254-6990, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington,DC 20581.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2><T3>Paperwork Reduction Burden:</T3> The public reporting burden for thiscollection of information is estimated to average ten minutes per response,including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing dataresources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing andreviewing the collection of information.

Background</ITAG>The Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 1 <T3>et seq., </T3>vests the Commission with jurisdiction over, among otherthings, ``accounts, agreements (including any transaction which is of thecharacter of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an `option' * * *.)''7 U.S.C. 2. Section 4c of the Act generally permits the trading of commodityoptions only subject to regulations issued by the Commission and grantsthe Commission the authority to permit the offer and sale of communityoptions without the requirement of exchange trading under such terms andconditions as the Commission may prescribe. 7 U.S.C. 6c(b), 6c(c).\1\<NOTE/> CFTC regulations, 17 CFR 1 <T3>et seq., </T3>require that, with narrowly defined exceptions, all transactionsin commodity options be executed on or subject to the rules of contractmarkets (exchanges) designated by the CFTC. Currently, Commission regulationspermit two categories of commodity options to be traded other than on designatedcontract markets: Dealer options and trade options.\2\<NOTE/> In addition, the Commission has authority to exempt particularoption transactions from certain aspects of its rules by rule or order\3\<NOTE/> and to authorize the domestic offer and sale of options executedon a foreign exchange.\4\ <NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 4c(f) of the Act provides, however, that the Actshall not be deemed to govern or apply ``to any transaction in an optionon foreign currency traded <T3>on</T3> a national securities exchange.'' 7 U.S.C. 6c(f) (emphasisadded).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Dealer options are options granted by a person who wasin the business of granting options on a physical commodity and in thebusiness of buying, selling, producing or otherwise using that commodityas of May 1, 1978 and who satisfies certain net worth and other requirementsof Commission rules. 7 U.S.C. 6c(d)(1); 17 CFR 32.12 (1988). Trade optionsare options (other than options on domestic agricultural commodities enumeratedin Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act) offered by a person who ``has a reasonablebasis to believe that the option is offered to a producer, processor orcommercial user of, or a merchant handling, the commodity underlying theoption, or the products or by-products thereof, and that such producer,processor, commercial user or merchant is offered or enters into the commodityoption transaction solely for purposes related to its business as such.''Rule 32.4(a), 17 CFR 32.4(a) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Commission Rule 32.4(b) states that the Commission ``may,by order, upon written request or upon its own motion, exempt any * * *person, either unconditionally or on a temporary or other conditional basis,''except as to options on enumerated agricultural commodities, from the generalban on off-exchange options ``if it finds, in its discretion, that it wouldnot be contrary to the public interest to grant such exemption.'' 17 CFR32.4(b) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Commission Rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1988). Pursuantto Rule 30.3(a), the Commission has authorized certain option contractstraded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, the Sydney FuturesExchange, and the Montreal Exchange to be offered and sold to persons locatedin the United States (53 FR 28826, 28832 and 28840, respectively, (July29, 1988)).The recent development of hybrid instruments that couple elements of futuresor commodity option contracts with debt or depository obligations or otherinterests that are not otherwise subject to regulation under the Act reflectscommercial interest in offering to the public instruments that are indexedto the price of a commodity through transactions that take place otherthan on designated contract markets. Such instruments may entail certainof the risks of commodity futures or option transactions but would be offeredand sold over-the-counter or on securities exchanges. Thus, they wouldnot be subject to certain protections, which specifically address commodity-relatedrisks, afforded participants in transactions effected on or pursuant tothe rule of CFTC-designated exchange markets.In issuing the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Regulation of Hybridand Related Instruments) (``Advance Notice''), 52 FR 47022 (December 11,1987), the Commission recognized that the proliferation of hybrid instrumentsincorporating futures or commodity option elements in innovative formatshas caused uncertainty as to the regulatory status of such instruments.The Commission believes that these marketplace developments and concomitantuncertainly concerning their regulatory implications must be carefullyaddressed to ensure that existing regulatory structure do not unnecessarilyretard growth and innovation or fail to provide protections responsiveto market developments. The Commission has therefore instituted this rulemakingas a means of assuring that hybrid instruments with an option componentare addressed in a manner that is consistent with the CEA and applicableregulations while permitting, to the extent possible, growth and innovationin rapidly developing markets.Under this proposal, hybrid instruments that have limited option components,that are subject to an alternative regulatory framework, and that satisfycertain additional requirements, may be offered and sold pursuant to thealternate regulatory scheme. Under this approach, the regulatory agencyresponsible for over-sight of the commodity-independent component of ahybrid instrument would exercise regulatory responsibility for the entireinstrument.In order to assure that the agencies responsible for monitoring such instrumentsare sensitive to the commodity-related risks which may not otherwise becommon to the instruments that they regulate, the CFTC has consulted withthe federal regulatory authorities responsible for oversight of securitiesand banking transactions and expects to continue to work with such agencies.In these discussions, the Commission has noted, among other things: theimportance of adequate disclosure to the public of risks of hybrid instrumentswhich may differ from typical investment risks; enforcement problems thatmay be associated with fraudulent sales of commodity-related interests;\5\<NOTE/> and the risks to issuers and the public posed by substantialcommodity price movements. As a result of these efforts, the agencies withregulatory responsibility for issuers of commodity-related hybrid instrumentsaffected by this proposal have indicated that they will review their regulationsand consider the adequacy of the protections afforded in such areas asrisk disclosures, sales practices, and financial soundness of the transactions.\6\<NOTE/> The Commission intends to cooperate fully with other federaland state authorities in their oversight of affected transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Fraudulent and other unlawful practices historically haveaffected the sale of commodity options. Such practices were among the factorsleading to the enactment of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (Pub. L.No. 74-675, andSection; 5, 49 Stat. 1494 (1936)) which, among other things,prohibited options trading in agricultural commodities then regulated underthe Grain Futures Trading Act of 1922. Fraudulent activities in non-agriculturalcommodities, most notably in the late 1960's and early to mid-1970's, resultedin the Commission's ban of all options trading in 1978. 43 FR 16153 (April17, 1978) (<T3>see </T3>43 FR at 16161 for a summary of the Commission's enforcementdifficulties in regulating commodity option transactions). The Commission'soptions ban was codified by Congress in the Futures Trading Act of 1978,92 Stat. 867, and options trading subsequent thereto has been permittedonly under carefully controlled conditions. Domestic exchange-traded commodityoption transactions are governed by Part 33 of the Commission's regulations.<T3>See, e.g., </T3>46 FR 54500 (November 3, 1981) for a discussion ofthe Commission's domestic exchange-traded options regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Commission has received correspondence from the staffsof the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''), the Board of Governorsof the Federal Reserve Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency reviewing their respective regulatory frameworks as applicablein these areas and recognizing their oversight responsibilities with respectto hybrid instruments. <T3>See </T3>Letter from Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of MarketRegulation, SEC, and Linda C. Quinn, Director, Division of CorporationFinance, SEC, to Marshall E. Hanbury, and Paula A. Tosini, Co-Chairmen,Task Force on Off-Exchange Instruments, CFTC, dated November 18, 1988;Letter from Michael Bradfield, General Counsel, Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System to Robert J. Mackay, Chief of Staff, CFTC, datedNovember 21, 1988; Letter from J. Michael Shepherd, Senior Deputy Comptroller,Corporate and Economic Programs, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,to Robert Mackay, Chief of Staff, CFTC, dated December 14, 1988.The current proposal also reflects the Commission's experience in reviewingproposed offerings of hybrid instruments on a case-by-case basis. Specifically,the Commission staff's Task Force on Off-Exchange Instruments has addresseda number of proposed offerings of instruments through a series of published``no-action'' letters, employing certain of the standards set forth inthe Advance Notice. For example, the staff has granted no-action reliefwith respect to proposed offerings of foreign currency-linked debt instruments,where the instrument's principal amount was indexed to a foreign currencyon no more than a one-to-one basis, the instrument bore an above-marketrate of interest, and other specified conditions were satisfied. Subsequently,the Commission established a notice procedure whereby issuers of foreigncurrency-linked instruments may establish eligibility for no-action reliefwithout securing specific prior Commission approval if they can confirmthat the proposed offering complies with the conditions to no-action reliefset forth in such letters.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ CFTC Advisory No. 39-88, June 23, 1988 (InterpretativeLetter No. 88-10, June 20, 1988, 2 Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) andpara;24,262);CFTC Advisory No. 45-88, July 19, 1988 (Interpretative Letter No. 88-11,July 13, 1988, 2 Comm. Fut. L. Rep.

(CCH) andpara;24,285).No-action relief has been issued with respect to other hybrid instruments,including debentures bearing fixed annual interest in excess of 35% ofthe estimated annual yield at the time of issuance for a comparable puredebt instrument and also providing for additional payments, capped at afixed amount, related to any increase in the price of natural gas overan established base price;\8\<NOTE/> and to certificates of deposit subject to insurance by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') with interest payableat maturity indexed, in part, to the spot price of gold and bearing a fixedrate of interest equal to at least 35% of the estimated annual yield atthe time of issuance for a comparable instrument.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Commission Advisory No. 63-88, September 21, 1988 (InterpretativeLetter dated September 6, 1988, 2 Comm.

(CCH) andpara;24,321).In addition, by letters dated September 30 and November 2, 1988, the TaskForce on Off-Exchange Instruments determined that it would not recommendthe initiation of enforcement action under Section 4c of the Act, 7 U.S.C.6c (1982), based upon the issuance of notes in two separate offerings whichprovided, among other things, for a non-commodity related return equalto at least 35% of the estimated annual yield at the time of issuance fora comparable pure debt or depository instrument and a commodity-relatedreturn based upon changes in the price of specified metals.Finally, this proposal reflects the Commission's careful review and analysisof comments received in response to the Advance Notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. History of the Rulemaking</ITAG>A. The Advance NoticeOn December 8, 1987, the Commission approved for publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerningthe regulation of hybrid and related instruments.\10\<NOTE/> The Advance Notice set forth a framework designed to providesimplified regulatory treatment on a prospective basis for certain categoriesof commodity-related hybrid instruments.

B. Summary of Comments on the Advance Notice<ITAG tagnum="81">1. In General</ITAG>The Commission received 56 comment letters on the proposal: five from domesticcontract markets; thirteen from banking institutions; four from federaland state regulatory agencies; seven from industry or professional associations;nine from oil companies and companies trading oil and petroleum products;eight from law firms and individuals lawyers; one from a stockholder-ownedgovernment-chartered corporation; one from a commodity trading advisorand commodity pool operator; one from a floor trading and market-makerpartnership; five from broker-dealer/futures commission merchants and investmentbanks; one from a financial broker active in brokering swaps; and one froma trading company active in the commodities markets. A substantial proportionof the comments received in response to the Advance Notice addressed thescope of the Act's forward contract exclusion, a subject beyond the scopeof this release. However, the jurisdictional exclusion proposed in theAdvance Notice, which is addressed in the interpretive statement issuedcontemporaneously herewith, and the proposed regulatory exemption alsoreceived extensive comment. A wide range of commenters addressing the proposed jurisdictional exclusionand regulatory exemption commended the Commission for endeavoring to clarifythe law applicable to off-exchange commodity-related instruments. The commentersexpressed widely divergent views, however, as to the appropriate regulatorytreatment of such instruments. A number of commenters asserted that theCommission's principal function is to regulate exchange-traded futuresand options and criticized the Advance Notice as an expansive assertionof jurisdiction that could impede legitimate off-exchange commercial transactions.These and other commenters contended that the off-exchange markets addressedby the Commission's proposal have not been marked by fraud, manipulationor other abuses and that CFTC regulation of such markets is therefore unwarranted.Further, a number of banks and investment firms contended that the regulatoryframework proposed by the Commission could have significant anticompetitiveeffects upon domestic capital markets. Conversely, other commenters, including the five futures exchanges thatcommented on the Advance Notice, stressed the Act's express mandate thatfutures transactions be conducted exclusively on approved exchange marketsand urged the Commission to proceed cautiously in order to avoid abandoningits statutory jurisdiction and diluting the customer and market protectionsestablished by Congress in the CEA. Several exchange commenters cited thehistorical experience of customer fraud and financial failures in unregulatedmarkets and stressed the potentially adverse effects of unregulated off-exchangemarkets upon regulated exchange markets. Commenters also extensively addressed the degree to which regulatory frameworksother than the CEA and Commission regulations are applicable to hybridinstruments and should be viewed as exclusive of Commission jurisdiction.A consortium of banks, for example, argued that Congress did not intendto accord the CFTC jurisdiction over banking activities permissible underthe federal banking laws, reasoning that a comprehensive regulatory frameworkalready exists for the regulation of such conduct. A contrary view, however,was expressed by commenters who contended that Congress did not intendto permit potentially divergent regulatory frameworks to supplant the CEA'ssingle, comprehensive regulatory framework for futures and options transactions.A number of commenters urged the Commission to consult with other federalregulators on the appropriate regulation of hybrid financial products.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proposed Jurisdictional Exclusion for Hybrid Instruments With DeMinimis Futures or Option Characteristics</ITAG>Commenters disagreed as to the benefits of the jurisdictional exclusionfor hybrid instruments with <T3>de minimis</T3> futures or option characteristics proposed in the AdvanceNotice. Among those commenters who specifically addressed the <T3>de minimis</T3> jurisdictional exclusion, certain contract marketsand an insurance industry trade group voiced specific support for the generalconcept of an exclusion. Ten commenters opposed the creation of a particularizedlist of excluded instruments, primarily on the ground that any specificitemization of excluded instruments could cause uncertainty as to whetherinstruments not specifically enumerated remained subject to Commissionregulation. Several of these commenters asserted that the instruments specificallyaddressed in the proposed jurisdictional exclusion, such as certain annuities,pensions, adjustable rate mortgages, employment agreements and lease contracts,\17\<NOTE/> generally have not been viewed as furtures or commodity optioncontracts and that their exclusion by rulemaking is therefore unnecessary.\18\<NOTE/> Other commenters noted that any express listing would requirecontinual updating and that each new product would have to be referredto the Commission for a determination. However, a number of commenters,including an insurance industry trade association, savings institutionsand swap dealers, requested that products specific to their industriesbe expressly excluded from Commission regulation.\19\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See </T3>52 FR at 47022, at 47024.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The Advance Notice proposal was prompted in part, however,by inquiries received by the Commission's staff concerning the status ofinstruments such as those proposed for exclusion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ For example, an insurance industry trade associationstated that all insurance and annuity products should be excluded becauseany indexing features of such products are subordinate and inextricablylinked to another non-transferable financial interest, the indexed componentof such products cannot be separately traded, and such products do notraise consumer protection or market integrity concerns.Three futures exchanges supported the proposed requirement that an excludedinstrument include an underlying contractual obligation that serves anindependent commercial purpose and that the transaction be entered intoother than for speculative, hedging or investment purposes. Several othercommenters opposed such a requirement, however, on the ground that theproposed restriction is unclear and overbroad in that the Commission'sjurisdiction does not reach all commodity-related transactions enteredinto for speculative, hedging or investment purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed Regulatory Exemption for ``Otherwise-Regulated'' HybridInstruments With Incidential Option Components</ITAG>The Advance Notice proposed a safe harbor exemptive procedure for hybridinstruments which contain only incidental commodity option components andare subject to an adequate alternative regualtory framework. Several commentersaddressed the appropriateness of the safe harbor approach proposed by theCommission. Two commenters supported the use of a safe harbor. Severalfutures exchanges opposed the proposed safe harbor approach, contending,for example, that such an exemption would fragment the regulatory responsibilityfor policing futures-related transactions and compromise the Act's regulatoryintegrity. Some commenters stated that Commission deference to multipleanalogous regulatory frameworks may conflict with Congressional intentand promote a complex, multitiered regulatory environment which would encouragebusiness to shop for the least restrictive regulatory system or to operatein the regulatory gaps. By contrast, other commenters stated that instrumentscovered by the safe harbor exemption are beyond the Commission's jurisdictionand that the criteria for exemption are too restrictive, contending thatonly a few products could meet such criteria and that adoption of the safeharbor would adversely affect the capital formation process and inhibitthe development of new products. Comments addressed to specific proposedconditions to the exemption are discussed below.<T3>Incidential Commodity Option Characteristics. </T3>The Advance Noticeproposed several standards to identify hybrid instruments possessing ``incidental''commodity option components: Minimum term to maturity of three years; minimumannual yield independent of the commodity-related component of the transactionequal to at least 35% of the estimated annual yield at the time of issuancefor comparable pure debt or depository instrument issued by the same issuer;a maximum average potential commodity-related return of 20% on an annualizedbasis; and use of the commodity component of the hybrid instrument in aprincipal line of business of the issuer.<T3>Minimum Term. </T3>Commenters who addressed the proposed term to maturityrequirement generally agreed that a three-year minimum term was unnecessarilyrestrictive and expressed concern that hybrid instruments satisfying therequirement would not be readily marketable. Some commenters noted thatthe markets for bank deposits, for example, are predominantly for instrumentswith shorter than three-year terms. Others added that corporations havebusiness needs for short-term financing and that a minimum three-year termwould diminish flexibility in product development. One commenter expressedthe opinion that even a minimum term of eighteen months would mean thataffected hybrid instruments could not be hedged effectively with currentlytraded futures contracts. Another commenter stated that a six-month termto maturity would be sufficient to preclude abuse of the regulatory exemptionby speculators.<T3>Minimum Commodity-Independent Yield. </T3>Five commenters (a futuresexchange, two law firms and two investment banking firms) addressed theproposed minimum commodity-independent yield.Several of these commenters agreed that such a requirement was not inappropriatebut disagreed as to where the standard should be drawn, suggesting figuresboth higher and lower than the proposed 35% requirement. One commenterstated that the proposed 35% requirement is reasonable provided that thereis no maximum commodity-based return. Others recommended that to facilitatecompliance, the minimum yield should be based on the best rate availablein any market (foreign or domestic) for a similar loan or debt instrumentof the same term. These commenters added that any regulation promulgatedwith respect to yield should specify the manner in which yield is to becalculated and address the effect on such calculation of an initial feecharged to the purchaser of a hybrid instrument. One commenter expressedthe view that the imposition of a minimum non-commodity yield is overlyrestrictive and unworkable as in many instances it may be impossible toidentify a comparable instrument.<T3>Maximum Commodity-Based Return. </T3>With respect to the proposed maximum20% annualized commodity-based return, several FCM/broker-dealer and investmentfirm commenters argued that such a restriction would unduly inhibit productdevelopment. One such commenter argued that a 20% ceiling on a hybrid instrument'scommodity-based return ignores yield volatility differences among commodities,that to impose a commodity-based yield restriction may render such instrumentsvirtually unmarketable, and that in determining the predominant characterof a hybrid instrument, the Commission should focus solely upon the instrument'snon-commodity yield. A futures exchange supported the use of a quantitativestandard to determine whether the option component of a hybrid instrumentis incidental but objected that the Commission's proposed standard actuallypermitted ``non-predominant'' option components as well as incidental optioncomponents. This commenter urged that the maximum commodity-based returnbe determined based upon an interest-rate sensitive measure, such as twicethe average return on the most recent five-year Treasury note auction.<T3>Line of Business. </T3>Commenters who addressed the proposed line ofbusiness requirement generally opposed such a requirement, contending,variously, that: (1) The requirement would unduly restrict the universeof potential users by preventing many financial institutions from qualifyingfor the exemption; (2) the requirement would not promote customer protection;(3) a hedging requirement in lieu of the requirement would protect customersand not restrain capital formation; (4) SEC regulations provide adequatecustomer protections and thus negate the need for the requirement; (5)the requirement is irrelevant to the predominance test; and (6) the requirementcannot be applied to inflation-indexed notes. One commenter added thatif such a requirement were adopted, it should be limited to a conditionthat the commodity interest be incidental to some aspect of the hybridissuer's business.<T3>Performance Criteria. </T3>The Advance Notice requested comment ontwo performance standards_minimum $100 million net worth and cover_intendedto address the ability of the issuer of an exempted hybrid instrument tosatisfy the commodity-related obligations created by such instruments.The Commission invited commenters to address not only the appropriatenessof such performance criteria but also whether an appropriate investmentgrade rating by a nationally-recognized bond rating service or compliancewith requirements imposed by another federal regulatory framework wouldbe acceptable substitutes.<T3>Net Worth. </T3>A contract market and a commodity trading advisor expressedsupport for a net worth requirement. The contract market contended thata minimum net worth requirement was an essential precaution to ensure thatissuers would be able to perform their obligations. The commodity tradingadvisor stated that although a minimum net worth standard is appropriate,an investment grade rating by a leading bond rating service should be consideredto be an acceptable alternative. Seven commenters objected to the net worthrequirement. Essentially, such commenters contended that a net worth requirementwould be unduly restrictive and would not necessarily reflect an investmentgrade rating by a national debt rating agency or other indicia of creditworthiness.Several commenters contended that a net worth requirement would impose,in effect, a merit review procedure on debt securities, which traditionallyhave not been subject to such review under the federal securities laws.\20\<NOTE/> Some commenters claimed that such ``merit-based'' reviewwould inhibit capital formation. The SEC, several broker-dealers and aninvestment bank noted that because a company's financial status may beanalyzed by reference to a combination of factors and financial benchmarks,the use of one static standard such as net worth could be overly restrictiveand potentially not reflective of the economic status of an issuer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Comparisons between the regulatory framework proposedin the Advance Notice and ``merit review'' would appear to be misplaced.Merit regulation typically refers to state law provisions empowering theadministrators of state securities laws (so-called ``Blue Sky'' laws) todeny securities registration under such state laws based upon the administrator'squalitative assessment of the proposed transaction's ``fairness.'' <T3>See, e.g. </T3>section 306 of the Uniform Securities Act (the modelBlue Sky statute) pursuant to which registration may be denied based upon,among other reasons, a determination that the offering would operate asa fraud upon purchasers or would provide unreasonable or excessive promoters'discounts, commissions or other compensation. <T3>See also </T3>section 25140 of the California Corporation Code, whichallows the Commissioner of Corporations to deny registration if the proposedplan of business and issuance of securities is not ``fair, just and equitable''or if the applicant is not believed to transact its business fairly andhonestly.The common alternative advanced by commenters who specifically objectedto the net worth requirement was disclosure of data which would enableinvestors to make an independent evaluation of the offering. Such commentersprincipally advocated reliance upon the disclosure requirements of thefederal securities laws to provide investors with the information necessaryto analyze the issuer's creditworthiness.Several commenters, including a commodity trading advisor, a futures industrytrade association and an insurance industry trade association, favoredreliance upon an investment grade rating by a leading bond rating servicein place of a net worth requirement. However, a futures exchange contendedthat an investment grade rating by a leading bond rating service wouldbe an inadequate substitute for the net worth requirement.Finally, a law firm suggested that issuers that qualify for listing onthe New York Stock Exchange or American Stock Exchange should be deemedeligible for the exemption and that the test should be applied only atthe time of issuance.\21\<NOTE/> In comparison, a futures exchange contended that the Commissionshould monitor for continued compliance with the net worth requirementby requiring filing of year-end financial statements and should requirean issuer to notify the Commission of any material changes in financialcondition. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The law firm noted that the original listing requirementfor the New York Stock Exchange is at least $18 million of net tangibleassets and that of the American Stock Exchange is $4 million of net worth(<T3>citing </T3>New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, Section102.01 and American Stock Exchange Company Guide, Section 101(a)). <T3>Cover. </T3>Eight commenters specifically addressed the cover requirement.Two commenters (a futures exchange and a bank) agreed that a cover requirementwas a reasonable and necessary precaution to insure that issuers are ableto perform their obligations. Six commenters, however, opposed the impositionof a cover requirement, essentially for the reasons cited in oppositionto the proposed net worth requirement.\22\<NOTE/> Essentially, commenters who objected to a cover requirementpreferred that the Commission rely upon the disclosure requirements offederal securities laws to provide investors with information sufficientto enable them to assess the risks of hybrid transactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ The SEC also contended that the cover requirement wasunrelated to the economic structure of most hybrid instruments, which typicallyinvolve cash settlement as opposed to physical delivery of the commodity.However, the proposed cover requirement was designed to provide assuranceof the issuer's ability to satisfy obligations related to commodity pricemovements for which cover would be meaningful without regard to the formof settlement of the instrument. Four commenters made specific recommendations concerning the nature ofany cover requirement to be adopted by the Commission. One such commenter,a futures exchange, stated that the issuer should obtain cover either throughphysical inventory or in the exchange futures or option markets. Threecommenters suggested that if a cover requirement were adopted, the Commissionshould expand the scope of permissible cover to include all commerciallyreasonable methods, such as letters of credit, hedging contracts, insurance,or transactions with affiliates.\23\<NOTE/> One commenter stated that the Commission should not limitthe concept of cover to the generic commodity that is the subject of thecommodity component of the hybrid instrument. A bank noted that if a three-yearminimum term is required, covering hybrid-related commodity exposure willbe difficult for many commodities, as it may not be possible to eliminatecommodity price risks through the purchase of options or futures contracts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ For purposes of the Commission's net capital rule, lettersof credit, insurance and transactions with affiliates are not specificallyenumerated as acceptable cover. <T3>See </T3>17 CFR 1.17(j)(1) (1988). Although upon request, the Commissionmay recognize nonenumerated transactions as cover, the Commission has,consistent with federal securities regulations, been guided by the conceptof liquidity contained in the net capital rule generally. ``<T3>Otherwise-Regulated'' Transactions. </T3>In issuing the Advance Notice,the Commission noted that a principal rationale for the proposed exemptionwas to relieve issuers of hybrid instruments that are adequately regulatedby another regulatory authority from duplicative regulatory requirements.The Commission therefore requested comment upon what altenative regulatoryframeworks should be considered sufficient to establish that a transactionis ``otherwise-regulated.'' As noted previously, a number of commentersexpressed the general view that instruments subject to regulation underthe federal banking or securities laws should not be subject to regulationunder the CEA and Commission regulations and that the CFTC lacked authorityto regulate such instruments. Some commenters argued that the Commission'ssuggestion that the alternate regulatory framework should be ``analogousto that provided by the Commission was unduly restrictive and that, apartfrom registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, substantiallyequivalent treatment to that provided by the CEA and Commission regulationsis unlikely to be applicable. <T3>Marketing of the Hybrid Instrument. </T3>Four commenters addressedthe Commission's proposals to condition the availability of exemptive treatmentupon the issuer's representation that the hybrid instrument will not bemarked to the public as having the beneficial characteristics of futurescontracts or commodity options. A futures exchange expressed approval ofthe proposed marketing restriction. Other commenters stated that it shouldbe permissible for insurers, underwriters, and sales agents to discussthe hybrid instrument's indexing features so long as no misrepresentationis made as to the character or regulatory status of the instrument. Inaddition, some commenters expressed the view that such discussions withcustomers may be mandatory under the disclosure requirements of the bankingor securities laws or necessary under common law fraud principles. Onecommenter suggested that the marketing restriction should be subject tothe disclosure requirements otherwise applicable to the issuer and to theissuer's determination as to what is required for full and fair disclosure.<T3>Minimum Unit Price. </T3>The Commission also proposed in the AdvanceNotice to condition exemptive treatment upon the issuer's representationthat the minimum unit price of the offering would be $20,000. A futuresexchange supported the requirement, believing that it would enhance thelikelihood that potential offerees will be financially secure and sophisticated.A commodity trading advisor/commodity pool operator contended that theminimum should be higher if the objective is customer protection. However,the eight commenters addressing this condition who opposed the minimumunit price requirement generally expressed concern that such a requirementwould have a detrimental effect on marketing, trading, liquidity and customerparticipation in the hybrid instrument markets. Several commenters pointedout that a large number of hybrid instruments will be subject to the securitieslaws, including the suitability requirements imposed on broker-dealers,requirements which they contended provide a better safeguard as to theability of an investor to bear the risk of investment than the proposedminimum unit size. A private law firm opposed the minimum unit price requirementon the ground that it had no relevance to the ``predominance'' inquiryor to an ``otherwise-regulated'' condition.<T3>Required Disclosure. </T3>One futures exchange supported the proposedrequirement that issuers of exempt instruments disclose their exempt statusand recommended that the Commission expand the requirement to include writtendisclosure of the risks inherent in the option component of the hybridinstrument in accordance with existing disclosure requirements for exchange-tradedoptions. Other commenters argued for expansion of the disclosure requirementto include a statement that the Commission has not reviewed or passed uponthe merits of the offering and that a purchaser would not have remediesavailable under the commodities laws. One commenter proposed that the Commissionprohibit any statements indicating that the Commission is regulating theinstrument rather than require disclosure of its exempt status.<T3>Special Calls. </T3>The Advance Notice proposal also included a requirementthat issuers of exempt hybrid instruments agree to submit to special callsfor information to demonstrate compliance with the conditions to exemptstatus. Three commenters addressed the special calls requirement. A futuresexchange and a law firm supported the proposal as a method to enable theCommission to monitor compliance with the conditions for exemption butsuggested that this condition not require the retroactive compilation ofdata or subject the issuer to surprise inspections. In contrast, a broker-dealeropposed such a procedure as unnecessary.<T3>Exemption Procedure. </T3>The exemption proposed in the Advance Noticewould have been made available based upon a self-executing filing by proposedissuers containing representations establishing compliance with the conditionsof exempt status. Two commenters argued that advance notice to the Commissionwould be inappropriate because the proposed offering typically will notbe priced nor an interest rate be selected until immediately before theoffering is made. A broker-dealer opposed the filing procedure, contendingthat it would only unnecessarily complicate offerings. A law firm expressedsupport for a filing procedure as a satisfactory means of claiming thebenefits of any rule. Two other commenters suggested that, in making suchfilings, issuers should be able to rely conclusively on an opinion froman investment banking firm that the requirements for exemption have beensatisfied.Three futures exchanges opposed the proposed self-executing nature of theexemption, contending that a review period is essential to permit the Commissionto verify whether the exemption eligibility criteria are met. These commenterscontended that it would be unfair to permit hybrid instruments to be exemptedfrom Commission regulation automatically upon the filing of a notice ofeligibility when exchange proposals for new contracts undergo extensiveCommission review and suggested that the Commission publish filings forexemption in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and seek public comment on such filings.<T3>Hybrids Offered by Governmental and Quasi-Governmental Entities. </T3>Commenterswere divided in their views as to the proposed comity exemption for hybridinstruments issued or offered by federal or state authorities, quasi-governmentalauthorities, and certain international agencies. Two commenters, one ofwhich was a quasi-governmental agency, expressed approval of the proposedexemption. These commenters suggested that the Commission should establisha safe harbor to exempt those obligations enumerated as municipal and governmentalsecurities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\24\<NOTE/> Those commenters opposing the exemption expressed concernas to the potentially unfair competitive advantage that would accrue underthe proposed exemption to hybrid instruments issued or offered by governmentalor quasi-governmental entities. These commenters contended that the Commissionshould not abdicate its oversight functions with respect to hybrid instrumentsoffered by state or quasi-governmental entities, particularly as some ofthese entities may compete with private sector issuers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Securities Exchange Act of 1934 section 3(a)(42), 15U.S.C. 78c(a)(42) (Supp. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Proposed Regulations</ITAG>A. In GeneralThe proposed rules would establish an exemptive framework, largely basedupon deference to existing regulatory standards affecting the noncommoditycomponent of such instruments, for hybrid instruments with limited optioncomponents. The Commission believes that the proposed rules, if adopted,will complement and expand ``no-action'' relief accorded heretofore inthe context of the Commission staff's review of proposed offerings. Theproposed rules will permit additional innovative uses of commodity-indexingsubject to limited conditions designed to afford assurance of the financialsoundness of such transactions and appropriate regulatory oversight thereof.As discussed previously, this proposal is predicated upon the applicabilityof other federal regulatory frameworks to affected instruments and uponrecognition by the relevant federal regulators that the special risks anddistinctive characteristics of commondity-related hybrid transactions canbe addressed under their respective regulatory frameworks. This proposalalso accords with the views of numerous commenters on the Advance Noticewho advocated that the Commission defer to other regulatory frameworksapplicable to such instruments and who cautioned against adoption by theCommission of restrictive exemptive criteria that could impede capitalformation. This proposal further reflects the Commission's continuing endeavorto coordinate and harmonize its regulatory framework with the regulatoryframeworks of other federal regulators in a manner consistent with Congressionalintent and the public interest.\25\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Commission Regulation andSection;1.17, 17 CFR 1.17 (Minimumfinancial requirements for broker-dealer/futures commission merchants);Commission Regulation andSection; 4.5, 17 CFR 4.5 (1988) (Exclusion fromthe definition of commodity pool operator for certain otherwise-regulatedpersons); Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets (May1988).The Commission is proposing exemptive criteria that principally dependupon the regulated or exempt status of the hybrid instrument under thefederal securities and banking laws and upon the satisfaction of one offive alternate performance criteria, which include investment grade rating,minimum net worth, cover, and, in the case of bank issues, FDIC insuranceor investment grade ratings for outstanding debt instruments of the samebank. The Commission believes that these alternate criteria provide somecomfort as to the financial soundness of affected hybrid transaction, whileaffording hybrid issuers substantial flexiblity. The Commission thereforebelieves that this proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the legitimateinterests of market participants in employing commodity-related interestsin conjunction with capital formation and commercial activities and thepolicy concerns reflected in the CEA.B. Synopsis of the Proposed Regulations<T3>Definitions. </T3>Section 34.1 of the proposed rules sets forth definitionsof the terms ``commodity,'' ``hybrid instrument,'' ``commodity-dependentpayment,'' ``commodity-independent payment,'' and other terms used in theproposed rules. Proposed andSection; 34.1(a) would define ``commodity'' toinclude all commodities within the meaning of section 2(a)(1)(A) of theCEA. The statutory definition of ``commodity'' includes not only specificallyenumerated agricultural commodities but also ``also other goods and articles,except onions * * * and all services, rights, and interests in which contractsfor future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.'' 7 U.S.C.2. Consequently, references in the proposed rules to commodity-indexingwould encompass indexing to intangible ``services, rights, and interests''as well as to physical commodities.The proposed definition of ``hybrid instrument'' set forth in andSection;34.1(b) is drafted to include debt or depository instruments \26\<NOTE/> having a commodity component that is not severable from theinstrument as a whole. The definition is designed to make clear that ``hybridinstruments'' are interests that combine non-severable option or futures-likeinterests with other interests.\27\<NOTE/> This means, for example, that if detachable commodity interestis offered in conjunction with a debt instrument or if the maturity ofthe commodity interest exceeds that of the debt instrument, the unit comprisingthe commodity and debt interests would not consititute a ``hybrid instrument''under the proposed rules, and the commodity interest would be fully subjectto the requirements of the Act and Commission regulations. This definitionaccords with the treatment proposed in the Advance Notice for option instrumentsdirectly on a commodity offered by a private grantor, separately or inconjunction with debt obligations, in a public offering registered withthe SEC but that would in either case thereafter be traded exclusivelyon a designated futures exchange.\28\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ The Commission requests comment as to the appropriatenessand the manner of delimiting equity and other interests as hybrid instrumentswithin the meaning of proposed Rule 34.1(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Even though hybrid instruments may include futures-likeinterests, this exemptive procedure only applies to hybrid instrumentswith option components. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See </T3>52 FR 47028.Proposed andSection; 34.1(c) defines ``commodity-independent payment'' as``any payment pursuant to a hybrid instrument that does not result fromindexing to, or calculation by reference to, the price of a commodity.''Proposed andSection; 34.1(d) defines ``commodity-dependent payment'' as theconverse of ``commodity-independent payment,'' that is, as any paymentpursuant to a hybrid instrument ``resulting from indexing to, or calculationby reference to, the price of a commodity.'' Consequently, a hybrid's commoditycomponent would include that portion of the principal or interest, or both,of a debt or depository instrument that is indexed to the price of a commodity.Thus, this definition confirms that an indexing mechanism need not be confinedto any particular component of a hybrid instrument, thereby permittingflexibility in the design of such instrument's provided that the commoditycomponent is not severable from the instrument as a whole. Proposed andSection;34.1(e) defines ``commodity option based payment'' to include any commodity-dependentpayment in which the commodity indexing results in the indexing of paymentsfor commodity price changes either above or below the indexing referenceprice but not both.Proposed andSection; 34.1(f) defines ``implied option premium'' as the issueprice of a hybrid instrument with commodity option components less thepresent discounted value of the instrument's commodity-independent payments.\29\<NOTE/> The applicable discount rate is the annual yield at the timeof issuance for a comparable non-hybrid debt or depository instrument ofa similar term issued by the same or a comparable issuer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ For example, consider an oil-indexed note issued at parwhen the spot price of oil is $20 per barrel with a maturity of 5 years,a principal amount of $1000 and interest of 3% per annum. At maturity,the purchaser receives the principal plus an additional payment equal tothe oil price at maturity in excess of $30 but not exceeding $50 multipliedby 100 barrels. [The commodity-dependent payment is indexed on more thana one-to-one basis since any positive price change is multiplied by 100barrels instead of 50 barrels.] If we assume the same issuer would pay9% per annum for a conventional debt instrument of the same maturity, thenthe implied option premium is equal to:<ITAG tagnum="28">Discount rate = 9% per annum</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Issue price = $1000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Present discounted value of the commodity-independent payments = </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Implied option premium = $1000^766.62=$233.38</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission will accept the underwriter's good-faith estimate ofwhat the issuer's debt rate would be for a comparable fixed income instrument.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p6,6/1,g1,t1,6,1,18,8</C> <H1>$1000</H1><H2>(1.09)\5\ </H2><H1>+ </H1><H1>30andmultiply;1^[1/(1.09)\5\]</H1><H2>.09 </H2><H1>= $766.62</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p6,6/1,g1,t1,22,1,6,7</C> <H1>Implied option premium</H1><H2>Issue price </H2><H1>=</H1><H1>$233.38</H1><H2>$1000</H2><H1> = 23.3%</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><T3>Proposed Regulatory Exemption for Certain Hybrid Instruments with CommodityOption Components</T3>. The Commission is proposing an exemption from regulationfor a class of hybrid instruments with limited option commodity components.The proposed exemption, which would appear at andSection; 34.2(a), wouldapply to hybrid instruments for which an appropriate degree of federaloversight exists and would be conditioned upon compliance with one of anumber of alternative performance criteria designed to provide assuranceof the financial integrity of such transactions.Under proposed andSection; 34.2(a), eligible debt securities would be limitedto securities registered in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933(``1933 Act'') or qualifying for specified exemptions from registration.Eligible exempt debt securities would include: Debt securities issued inprivate offerings pursuant to SEC Regulation 506, 17 CFR Part 506 (1988);exempt debt securities under section 3(a)(2) of the 1933 Act that are issuedor guaranteed by the United States, the District of Columbia, any stateof the United States, or any political subdivision or public instrumentalitythereof, or by any bank that is a member of the FDIC; commercial paperexempt from registration under section 3(a)(3) of the 1933 Act; and insurancepolicies and annuity contracts subject to state regulation and exempt fromregistration under section 3(a)(8) of the 1933 Act. The Commission's intentionis to make the exemption available with respect to: (1) Hybrid debt securitiesthat are issued in connection with registered offerings and thus are subjectto the full range of 1933 Act protections; (2) hybrid debt instrumentsthat are issued pursuant to exemptions from the 1933 Act that provide otherindicia of soundness, such as the exemption for government issues; or (3)transactions as to which such protections generally should be unnecessary,such as sales of commercial paper.\30\<NOTE/> Time deposits offered by an FDIC-member bank would also constituteeligible instruments under andSection; 34.2(a)(1) due to the applicabilityof federal regulation to the offering bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ In addition, for example, proposed andSection; 34.2(a)incorporates the 1933 Act's exemption for insurance policies ``issued bya corporation subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner,bank commissioner, or any agency or officer performing like functions,of any State or Territory of the United States or the District of Columbia.''This approach is based both upon the character of such interests as primarilynon-investment vehicles as well as upon the existence of a state regulatorystructure applicable to a field historically viewed as sufficiently addressedby state regulation. In addition, as noted by an insurance trade associationin commenting upon the Advance Notice, such products are generally non-transferable,individually negotiated contracts. <T3>See also </T3>52 FR 47022, at 47024.Under proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(2), the commodity component of exemptedinstruments would be subject to a maximum implied option premium of 40%of the issue price of the instruments. As previously noted, the term ``impliedoption premium'' would be defined in proposed andSection; 34.1(f) as theissue price of the instrument less the present, or discounted, value ofthe instrument's commodity-independent payments.\31\<NOTE/> Under this standard, those instruments which have impliedoption premiums greater than 40% of the instrument's total price at issuancewould be ineligible for exemption under the proposed regulations.\32\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See</T3> footnote 29 <T3>supra</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ If the proposed exemption were to be extended to grantedoptions in addition to purchased options, the maximum implied option premiumcriterion would be required to be framed in terms of the absolute valueof the implied option premium and, in addition, establishment of a ceilingon maximum loss might be appropriate. The Commission requests comment asto the appropriateness of extending the proposed exemption to granted optionsand the conditions pursuant to which such options should be permitted.The Commission also proposes to condition the availability of exemptiverelief under proposed andSection;34.2(a) to transactions which satisfy oneof five alternate ``performance criteria'' designed to provide furtherassurance of the ability of the offeror of the hybrid instrument to satisfyits obligations under the instrument. As set forth in proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3),these criteria would streamline the performance criteria set forth in theAdvance Notice by making minimum net worth and cover requirements alternativerather than cumulative requirements and by providing additional means ofsatisfying the performance condition. Thus, under proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3),the issuer or instrument must comply with <T3>one</T3> of the following requirements: (i) The instrument has beenrated in one of the three highest categories by at least two nationallyrecognized investment rating organizations; (ii) the issuer maintains atleast $100 million in net worth; (iii) the issuer maintains cover equalto the amount of its commitments to deliver, to take delivery of, or topay the cash value of, the commodity (or a change in the price of the commoditythat is the subject of the commodity component of the instrument); \3\\3\<NOTE/> or in the case of a bank issuer: (iv) Other outstanding debtinstruments offered by the same bank have been rated in one of the threehighest categories by at least two nationally recognized investment ratingorganizations; or (v) the instrument is subject to FDIC insurance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ The Commission requests comment whether there are otherperformance criteria in addition to those proposed which also should beconsidered sufficient to qualify an issuer.The andSection;34.2 exemption would be conditioned upon compliance with aprohibition against marketing of the instrument as a futures contract ora commodity option or, except to the extent necessary to describe the functioningof the instrument or to comply with applicable disclosure requirements,as having the characteristics of futures contracts or commodity options.This restriction would prevent marketing representations that would beinconsistent with what the Commission believes to be the character of suchinstruments and with the proposed regulatory treatment of such instruments.Such representations could potentially mislead purchasers as to the essentialnature of the instruments, their legal status and the form of regulatorysupervision to which they are subject.The exception for disclosures that are purely descriptive in nature andnecessary to disclose fairly the operation of the instrument or that arerequired by federal securities laws or other disclosure requirements makesexpress what the Commission believed to be implicit in the marketing restrictionproposed in the Advance Notice. However, a number of commenters expressedconcern that the proposed prohibition upon marketing of hybrid instrumentsas having the beneficial characteristics of futures or commodity optionscontracts could result in issuers failing to provide a full descriptionof the operation of the instrument or to make required disclosures. Therefore,the Commission has sought to make clear in proposed andSection;34.2(a)(4)that objective descriptive data necessary to full disclosure are not prohibited.The Commission believes that proposed andSection;34.2(a)(4) balances theneed to prevent misleading characterizations of the nature of exemptedinstruments with the objective of assuring meaningful disclosure of theactual operation and risks of such instruments.Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(5) would preclude settlement of an exempted hybridinstrument by means of a delivery instrument, such as an exchange-approvedwarehouse receipt or shipping certificate, that is specified in the rulesof a designated contract market. This provision would preclude only settlementin delivery instruments specifically defined as such in exchange rules.It would not preclude settlement in the form of a commodity that is ofdeliverable grade or quality under exchange rules. Thus, for example, anexempted instrument may be settled in the commodity meeting the deliverystandards of an exchange futures contract for that commodity but may notbe settled in an exchange-approved warehouse receipt for that commodity.The Commission believes that this requirement will not interfere with theability of issuers to elect physical delivery alternatives to cash settlementbut will protect against interference with deliverable supplies for settlementof designated futures or option contracts and potential congestion andprice manipulation in such markets.Proposed andSection;34.2(b) states that the Commission may, upon writtenpetition, grant such further exemptions with respect to hybrid instrumentsas it determines are not contrary to the public interest. This provisionreflects the Commission's existing authority under Section 4c(b) of theAct, 7 U.S.C. 6c(b), to prescribe by rule, regulation or order the termsand conditions pursuant to which commodity option transactions may occur.As drafted, proposed andSection;34.2(b) is broader than current Rule 32.4(b),which provides that the Commission may by order exempt any person fromany provision of Part 32 <T3>except</T3> andSection;andSection;32.2, 32.8 and 32.9,\3\\4\<NOTE/> if it finds such exemption not contrary to the public interest.Proposed andSection;34.2(b) potentially would permit case-by-case exemptiverelief from all Commission regulations applicable to option transactions.The Commission believes that the broader exemptive relief contemplatedin proposed andSection;34.2(b) is appropriate in the context of hybrid transactionswhich, in contrast to the non-hybrid interests addressed by Rule 32.4(b),contain option elements in combination with a debt or depository interestnot otherwise subject to Commission regulation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ Rule 32.2 precludes off-exchange option transactionson enumerated agricultural commodities. Rules 32.8 and 32.9 relate, respectively,to unlawful representations and fraud in connection with commodity optiontransactions.<T3>Proposed Notice Requirement for Exempted Option Hybrids. </T3>The Commissionis also proposing a notice requirement, applicable to offerings of exemptedoption hybrid instruments where the price used for determining the settlementof such instruments' commodity component is based on prices reported ona designated contract market. In these limited circumstances, proposedandSection;34.3 would require the issuer to provide the Commission with writtennotice, within five business days of the effective date of the offering,of: (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the issuer and of adesignated contact person for such issuer; (ii) the maturity date and authorizedor anticipated size of the offering; and (iii) a copy of the prospectus,offering document or other written description of the instrument providedto actual or prospective purchasers thereof. This notice procedure wouldfacilitate the Commission's market surveillance efforts by providing informationrelevant to available cash market supplies. This proposed notice requirementis restricted to the very limited situation in which the exempted hybridmay directly impinge upon exchange-traded markets because its price isbased upon prices reported on a designated contract market. The noticerequirement applies only with respect to hybrid instruments exempted pursuantto andSection;34.2 whose settlement prices are based upon prices reportedon a designated contract market. The Commission believes that this noticeprocedure will assist it in discharging its market surveillance responsibilities,which are critical to the detection and prevention of market manipulations,and will serve as an adjunct to the Commission's large trader reportingsystem, which has been praised as a model for effective market surveillance.This requirement would supplant the notice of eligibility filing requirementand special call procedure proposed in the Advance Notice, both of whichwere criticized by some commenters as unnecessarily burdensome.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Case-By-Case Review of Other Jurisdictional Issues</ITAG>This proposal is intended to facilitate legitimate market developmentsin a field distinguished by innovation and rapid growth. Nevertheless,as the Commission recognized in the Advance Notice, no exemptive brightlines can be expected to address all hybrid instruments which may be appropriatefor exemptive treatment. Consequently, the Commission proposes to continueto review on a case-by-case basis, in appropriate circumstances, proposedofferings not addressed by the proposed rules.\35\<NOTE/> In this context, proposed andSection;34.2(b) would expresslyrecognize the Commission's discretion to grant particularized exemptions,as warranted, to hybrid instruments with option components. Such particularizedreview would permit the resolution of issues that are not susceptible togeneralized treatment, accommodate product innovation, and permit morelimited relief in cases that would not qualify for a categorical exemption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\In addition, during the pendency of this rulemaking, theCommission plans to continue to address proposed offerings on a case-by-casebasis under the auspices of the Task Force on Off-Exchange Instruments.<T3>See </T3>Section I, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">V. Related Matters</ITAG>A. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq., </T3>imposes certain requirements on federal agencies in connectionwith their conducting or sponsoring any collection of information as definedby the Paperwork Reduction Act. In compliance with the PRA the Commissionhas submitted this rule in proposed form and its associated informationcollection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget. Personswishing to comment on the information which would be required by this proposedrule should contact Gary Waxman, Office of Management and Budget, Room3228, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-7340. Copies of the informationcollection submission to OMB are available from Joseph G. Salazar, CFTCClearance Officer, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581, (202) 254-9735.As previously noted, proposed andSection;34.3 imposes a filing requirementonly with respect to hybrid instruments whose settlement price is basedupon prices reported on a designated contract market. These filings willprovide the Commission with information concerning transactions that mayhave a significant impact upon designated contract markets and will facilitatethe effective performance of the Commission's surveillance responsibilitiesunder the CEA. The Commission estimates that the one-time filing requirement,when applicable will require no more than ten minutes per response to prepare.Although the number of potential filers cannot be determined prospectively,based upon the Commission's staff experience with notice filings underrecent hybrid instrument advisories, it is estimated that approximatelythirty notices would be filed in one year pursuant to proposed Rule 34.3by issuers such as corporations, government-chartered corporations andbanks.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), Pub. L. 96-534, 94 Stat. 1164,5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>requires each Federal agency to consider, in the courseof proposing substantive rules, the effect of those rules on small entities.A small entity is defined to include, <T3>inter alia, </T3>a ``small business'' and a ``small organization,''5 U.S.C. 601(6).\36\<NOTE/> In defining a ``small business,'' the RFA adopts the definitionof ``small business concern'' in Section 3 of the Small Business Act, 5U.S.C. 601(3). However, an agency, after consultation with the Office ofAdvocacy of the SBA, may establish its own definition of a ``small business.''5 U.S.C. 601(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\``Small organization,'' as used in the RFA, means a ``not-for-profitenterprise which is independenly owned and operated and is not dominantin its field.'' 5 U.S.C. 601(4). The RFA does not incorporate the sizestandards of the Small Business Administration for small organizations.Agencies are expressly authorized to establish their own definitions ofsmall organization. (<T3>Id</T3>.) As a threshold matter, the Commission notes that the proposed rules, ifadopted, are not intended to introduce any new prohibitions but, rather,to clarify existing law and to provide exemptive relief from existing regulatoryrequirements. The current rulemaking would permit a broad class of hybridinstruments with option components to be traded without compliance withthe pre-existing statutory and regulatory requirements that commodity interestsbe traded on or subject to the rules of a designated exchange market. Byproviding objective standards for exemption from regulation, the proposalswill relieve issuers of regulatory constraints under the CEA and Commissionregulations. To the extent that a new notification procedure is established,that procedure entails insignificant cost and burden. The Commission anticipatesthat the proposed rules will dispel uncertainty concerning the appropriateregulatory requirements for various types of commodity-related hybrid instrumentsand thereby facilitate rather than impede novel forms of financial transactionswhile at the same time fulfilling the statutory mandates of the CEA. The Commission previously has formulated its own standards of what constitutesa small business with respect to the types of entities regulated by it.The Commission has determined that contract markets,\37\<NOTE/> futures commission merchants,\38\<NOTE/> registered commodity pool operators\39\<NOTE/> and large traders\40\<NOTE/> should not be considered small entities for purposes of theRFA. With respect to commodity trading advisors, floor brokers and introducingbrokers, the Commission has stated that it would evaluate within the contextof a particular rule proposal whether all or some of such entities shouldbe considered to be small entities and, in the event of such a finding,that it would analyze the economic impact on them of the proposed rule.\41\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ 47 FR 18618 (April 30, 1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 18619. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>Id. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 18620. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>Id. </T3>commodity trading advisors and floor brokers); 48 FR 35249,35276 (August 3, 1983) (introducing brokers). The Commission notes that the notification procedure for the proposed regulatoryexemption (proposed andSection; 34.3), would apply generally to any issuerof hybrid instruments with commodity option-dependent payments which arereferenced to a futures price on a designated contract market and doesnot specifically implicate any Commission registrant, large trader or contractmarket in their status as such. As the Commission's prior determinationsmay not address all entities potentially affected by the proposed exemption,the RFA's definition of small business may be relevant. Section 3 of theSmall Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, essentially provides a three-part definitionof ``small business concern'': One that is independently owned and operated;which is not dominant in its field; and which falls within the size standardsregarding dollar volume of business and/or number of employees establishedby the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (``SBA'').\42\<NOTE/> The current size standards of the SBA are set forth in 13CFR 121.2 (1988), which classifies businesses by industry categories (standardindustrial classifications or ``SIC''), such as mining, manufacturing,transportation, finance, insurance and real estate, and by reference toa maximum number of employees or annual receipts. These SIC standards arefurther modified by criteria specific to the SBA program pursuant to whicha business is seeking assistance.\43\<NOTE/> As previously noted by the Commission when it proposed itsown definitions of small entities with respect to entities regulated bythe Commission, SBA definitions of small businesses are clearly limitedin their usefulness for Commission purposes.\44\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ 15 U.S.C. 632(a)(1) provides in part: For the purposesof this chapter, a small-business concern, including but not limited toenterprises that are engaged in the business of production of food andfiber, ranching and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farmingand agricultural related industries, shall be deemed to be one which isindependently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its fieldof operation: Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of law,an agricultural enterprise shall be deemed to be a small business concernif it (including its affiliates) has annual receipts not in excess of $500,000.In addition to the foregoing criteria the Administrator, in making a detaileddefinition, may use these criteria, among others: Number of employees anddollar volume of business* * *. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>See </T3>13 CFR 121.4 (1988) (small business for financial programs)and 13 CFR 121.5 (1988) (small business for Government procurement). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ <T3>See </T3>46 FR 23940 n.3 (April 29, 1981).While the SIC classifications would be of assistance for a defined groupof hybrid instrument issuers, the inability to identify potential issuerslessens somewhat the usefulness of the SIC categories for purposes of addressingthe RFA implications of the proposed exemption. For example, although certain``heavy industries'' appear to be categorized as small businesses if theyemploy less than 500 employees, \45\<NOTE/> and certain ``service'' industries are small businesses iftheir annual revenue is less than $3.5 million,\46\<NOTE/> other industry categories, such as finance, insurance andreal estate, are considered small businesses only if their assets are lessthan $100 million.\47\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ 13 CFR 121.2 (1988) (Table 1-B. Mining, D. Manufacturing).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ <T3>Id. </T3>(Table 1-I. Services). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ <T3>Id. </T3>(Table 1-H. Finance, Insurance and Real Estate). For example,federally-charted banks and savings institutions are small businesses iftheir assets are less than $100 million. Based upon the Commission's experience with issuers who have sought no-actionrelief or filed notices pursuant to published Commission advisories concerninghybrid instruments, the Commission anticipates that most issuers wouldnot constitute ``small businesses.'' \48\<NOTE/> Of course, it is possible that firms defined as small businessesunder section 3 of the Small Business Act could issue commodity-relatedhybrid instruments and thus be affected by the proposed rules. While theCommission does not believe that such issuers will constitute a significantportion of total issuers of hybrid instruments, the Commission believesthat even if such were the case, the rules would not have a significanteconomic impact.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ All such petitioners for relief were either major corporations,government-chartered corporations or large banks and all had assets approachingor in excess of $100 million. The Commission further notes that under SECRule 157, 17 CFR 230.157, issuers of securities are considered to be smallentities for purposes of the RFA if their total assets are $5 million orless and the proposed offering does not exceed $5 million. Under such criteria,all of the petitioners who have sought regulatory relief or filed underhybrid advisory procedures with the Commission also would not be smallentities under SEC Rule 157.The Commission notes that the proposed rules would not require burdensomelegal, accounting, consulting or expert costs. The determination of whetheran offering would qualify for the proposed exemption requires minimal analysisof data that will be self-evident to the issuer. In making this determination,the issuer would be permitted to rely upon the underwriter's good faithopinion as to the offering's compliance with the quantitative conditionsto exemptive treatment. In those limited cases in which the issuer mustfile a notice with the Commission (<T3>i.e.</T3>, when the settlement price is based upon prices reportedon a designated contract market), the Commission notes that the informationrequired to be disclosed in the filing notice is minimal, will be knownto the issuer, and will not require any data compilation or analysis. Indeed,for those issuers which are required to comply with the registration requirementsof the Securities Act of 1933, the prospectus requested by the Commissionwill have been generated in the first instance by the issuer in order tocomply with the mandatory disclosure requirements of the 1933 Act. Theother information requirements, <T3>e.g.</T3>, name and address of the issuer and offering size, are <T3>de minimis</T3>. Accordingly, the Chairman, on behalf of the Commission, certifies pursuantto section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the proposed rules willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. Nonetheless, the Commission invites comment from any firm whichbelieves that these rules, as proposed, would have a significant economicimpact on its operations.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 34</ITAG>Commodity futures, Commodity options, Hybrid instruments.For the reasons set forth above, new Part 34 is proposed to be added toTitle 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 34_REGULATION OF HYBRID INSTRUMENTS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">34.1 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">34.2 Option Hybrid exemption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">34.3 Option Hybrid notice requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>7 U.S.C. 2, 6c and 12a.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 34.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Definitions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Commodity</T3>.
