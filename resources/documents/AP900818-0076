The administration decried the use of ``innocentcivilians as pawns'' in Saddam Hussein's stand againstinternational sanctions.   President Bush called on Iraq to immediately reconsider itsrefusal to let the foreigners, including an estimated 3,000Americans, leave.   The White House, in a statement by press secretary MarlinFitzwater, also said it was ``deeply concerned'' by today'sannouncement from Baghdad that the Iraqi government may withholdfood from the foreigners.   Fitzwater said Iraq's announcement that it would not allowcitizens from ``aggressive nations'' to leave is ``totallyunacceptable.''   He said Bush ``is deeply troubled by the indication that Iraqiauthorities intend to relocate these individuals within Iraqagainst their will.''   ``The use of innocent civilians as pawns to promote what Iraqsees to be its self-interest is contrary to international law andindeed to all accepted norms of international conduct,'' thespokesman said.   Fitzwater said, ``We urge that Iraq immediately reconsider itsrefusal to allow any foreign national desiring to leave to do sowithout delay or condition.''   He said Iraq should ``take note of (Friday's) statement by the(United Nations) Security Council president expressing thecouncil's concern and anxiety over the situation of foreign nationsin Iraq and Kuwait, and calling upon the secretary general to takeall appropriate steps.''   Fitzwater did not specify what action the United States wasprepared to take if the Iraqis do not reverse course.   But he added, ``The United States intends to consult with othergovernments, with citizens being held in Iraq and Kuwait, todetermine what additional measures ought to be taken.''   Bush will return to Washington earlier than planned Sunday tomeet with his national security advisers over dinner, the WhiteHouse said. He is returning to the White House for the night andwill meet with Energy Secretary James Watkins Monday morning toreview the impact of the crisis on U.S. oil reserves.   The vacation White House issued Fitzwater's statement shortlyafter a spokesman for Saddam Hussein appeared on Baghdad televisioncalling the U.N. economic embargo ``an act of war'' and warningthat foreign nationals it holds will suffer along with Iraqis ifshortages of food and medicine develop.   Fitzwater said Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gatescalled Bush on his speedboat Fidelity at 11:30 a.m. EDT to discussthe Iraqi statement and the administration's response.   The actions came as Bush is readying a call-up of U.S. militaryreserves and the Pentagon launched an unprecedented diversion ofcivilian aircraft to bolster the U.S. military presence in theMiddle East.   Bush, teeing off at golf before 7 a.m. today, refused to answerreporters' questions about the gulf crisis. Asked if he had been intouch with the White House situation room, Bush replied crisply,``I talk to them every morning at 5:30 and I'm not going to takeany more comments up here.''   Although Bush has decided to use reservists to fill in the ranksof military doctors, cargo handlers and other specialists, he isstill weighing how many are needed to meet the Persian Gulf crisis,White House officials said.   An Army source today said the Pentagon's recommendation to callup reserves did not include a specific number, but that as many as80,000 armed services reservists and National Guardsmen could beactivated.   The 80,000 figure is ``a tentative upper limit planningfigure,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Thesource said the actual number of reserves called up ``surely willbe less than that.''   The source said also that the Army has not received the go-aheadfrom the White House to begin any activation of reserves, but thatif the order came today, the first group of reservists could beprocessed for action within 24 hours.   Bush has the authority to activate up to 200,000 reservists for90 days, with the option of keeping them on active duty for another90 days.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney refused to give a timetable forthe U.S. commitment, saying en route to Saudi Arabia, ``Where we'llbe a year or two from now, I wouldn't want to speculate.''   It is Cheney's second trip to Saudi Arabia since Iraqi forcesinvaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.   In the tense gulf region, Navy commanders stopped two Iraqivessels Friday, but let them proceed after U.S. forces determinedthey were not carrying supplies for Iraq, an economic pariah sincethe occupation of Kuwait. The ships were not boarded.   The United States is acting under criticism from United NationsSecretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. He said Thursday thatthis country's naval barricade to enforce U.N. economic sanctionsagainst Iraq was undertaken without the authority of the U.N.Security Council   ``We believe it's fully authorized,'' White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater countered Friday.   In another announcement, the Pentagon on Friday said up to 38commercial airliners were being turned over to the military to haultroops and cargo. Although there have been charters, this is thefirst time part of the U.S. civil air fleet has been diverted undera plan conceived in the 1950s.   The decision was made by the commander-in-chief of the U.S.Transportation Command and Military Airlift Command, Gen. H.T.Johnson, to meet the ``growing airlift requirements'' for U.S.forces deployed in the Middle East, a Defense Department statementsaid.   The planes are owned by 16 airlines, which also will beproviding the crews to operate them.   The airlift support is expected to be needed for several weeks,the Pentagon said.   Fresh concerns were raised about the safety of Americans after35 U.S. citizens were removed from the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad andtaken to an undisclosed location, most likely another hotel.   American diplomats in Baghdad believe the Americans may havebeen taken to the Melia Monsour, a hotel where British citizens arealso quartered. But Iraqi authorities prevented the embassyofficials from entering the hotel to check, State Departmentspokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington.   Bush also plans to address the Veterans of Foreign Warconvention in Baltimore Monday and make a campaign trip to RhodeIsland before returning to Kennebunkport.</TEXT></DOC>
