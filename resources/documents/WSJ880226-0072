When, after the 1968 season, pitchers like Bob Gibson seemed to be running away with the game, Major League Baseball reduced the Zone, raising the lower boundary from the bottom to the top of the knee.    This year, the official size of the Zone is being reduced again. Except that, in practice, the rules committee says, it actually will be bigger. If this is confusing, understand that, in recent seasons, as Joe Brinkman, a veteran American League umpire says, the Zone &quot;has naturally been shrinking.&quot;    The result is plain to see. With pitchers throwing at a smaller target, home runs are up -- way up. Last year, batters smashed a record 4,458 of them. Orel Hershiser, a Los Angeles Dodgers righthander, says, &quot;The strike zone was so small the hitters knew you had to throw it down the middle of the plate.&quot;    There are other explanations, of course, for the home run binge. The most appealing is that agents of the deposed Jean-Claude Duvalier, in a desperate attempt at restoration, accidentally spilled a non-lethal dose of nerve gas into Haitian baseball factories, thereby producing a &quot;juiced up&quot; baseball. But even granting that, how to explain that American League pitchers threw a record number (7,812) of walks last year?    And here, courtesy of the Elias Sports Bureau, is the truly shattering evidence. Baseball games -- as if, while changing the channel in the middle innings, you hadn't sensed it -- are getting longer. The average American League game, two hours and 51 minutes, is up from 2:37 in 1984. Over the same span, National League games climbed to 2:45 from 2:34. In other words, too many pitches missing a too-small Zone.    The target, in effect, is narrower as well as shorter. The old technique of demurely informing batters that they are standing too close to the plate -- aiming a rising fastball under their chin -- is outlawed. Nowadays, a little chin music can get a pitcher and his manager ejected. With batters standing closer, the entire Zone is within easy reach.    And pitches at or above the batter's navel are routinely called high. This is why, over the winter, the rule was changed. Oddly enough, the old rule defined a strike as &quot;the space over home plate between the batter's armpits and the top of his knees when he assumes his natural stance.&quot; Even allowing for Mickey Rivers-type contorted stances at the plate, most players' armpits are above their navels.    So why the ball calls? Pat Gillick, a vice president for the Toronto Blue Jays and a member of the rules committee, says, &quot;We think the umpires were reducing the strike zone in their mind.&quot; No problem with the rule, in other words; it was the Zone in their minds that was out of whack.    So how did umpires learn to call strikes? For Mr. Brinkman, who also runs an umpiring school in Cocoa, Fla., it was &quot;by osmosis.&quot;    &quot;It was a triple-A game in 1968,&quot; he says. &quot;The Louisville Cardinals and the Columbus Jets. I called a strike and guys jumped out of the dugout. I said a pitch at the armpits is a strike. They said, 'Not here.' The whole game, I kept bringing it lower. When the guys quieted down, I said, 'I guess this is the strike zone.'&quot;    In other words, blame the players. Well, sort of. Mr. Brinkman also faults pitching coaches. Recognizing that high pitches are meat for sluggers, they tutored pupils to aim low, reducing the acceptable range, he says. Another theory holds that as umpires switched to smaller chest protectors in the '70s and '80s they lowered their stance behind the catcher. The Zone thus sank with the ump's eye level.    Tommy Lasorda, however, holds the umpires faultless. &quot;I thought it (the Zone) was smaller the last two years,&quot; Lasorda says. However, the Dodger manager adds, &quot;It's not the umpires; they didn't change it.&quot; Asked to explain, Lasorda says, with the patience of a physicist reviewing a fine point of nuclear fission, &quot;It's very simple.&quot; End of conversation.    So we'll leave aside the question of blame. The new rule changes the upper limit of the Zone to &quot;the mid-point between the top of the uniform pants and the top of the shoulders.&quot; Read literally, the new Zone extends to about the bottom of the rib cage. That's smaller than the old rule, but larger than how the Zone was called in games.    Tommy John, the Yankees ace, says, &quot;I don't even understand the new rule.&quot; He says he'll pitch 'em like before until umps start changing. For a slow, sinker-baller like John, who cares anyway? But when batters face a pitcher with heat, the rising fastball will be a tougher pitch to take. Expect some swinging strikes.    In all likelihood, umps will gingerly expand the actual Zone by perhaps an inch, maybe a bit more, players willing. &quot;The old rule was almost unworkable for us,&quot; says Marty Springstead, supervisor of umpires in the American League. But even with the new rule, Mr. Springstead cautions, don't expect uniformity. &quot;You got Clemens throwing 97 m.p.h. from 60 feet, six inches on top of a hill. It isn't very easy.    &quot;Everyone wants a perfect strike zone. I don't think it exists.&quot;    ---   Mr. Lowenstein is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
