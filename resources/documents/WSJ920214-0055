Disappointed by falling exports to China, Dutch officialshave called into question a 1984 pact in which theNetherlands agreed to stop selling weapons to Taiwan. Theresult, the Dutch hope, will be a greater effort by Beijingto buy Dutch goods.</LP><TEXT>   The Dutch cabinet is due to discuss today whether to granta license for a proposed sale of Dutch-built submarines toTaiwan's navy. Dutch politicians say it's unlikely that thegovernment will allow the sale as originally envisioned byTaiwan. But they say Taiwan might be allowed to buy certainsubmarine parts.   The order would go to Rotterdamsche Droogdok MaatschappijBV, or RDM, a Rotterdam unit of Begemann Groep NV, aconglomerate based in Breda, the Netherlands. An RDMspokesman said Taiwan has expressed interest in buying foursubmarines initially and taking an option on six more. RDMhopes that it might be allowed to sell submarines stripped oftorpedo launchers and other military gear.   Hollandse Signaalapparaten, or HSA, a unit of France'sThomson-CSF S.A., would supply radar equipment for thesubmarines, according to Dutch press reports. A spokesman forHSA said the company wouldn't comment before the cabinetdecision is announced.   For RDM, the proposed sale is crucial. The Dutch Navy twoyears ago reduced its order for submarines to four from six.The final sub is due to be launched in April. RDM has nofurther orders on its books, unless the Taiwan deal goesthrough. The company, which was sold by the Dutch governmentto Begemann last year, employs about 600 people in itssubmarine division.   A decade ago, a Dutch sale of submarines to Taiwaninfuriated China, which retaliated by reducing its diplomaticrelations with the Netherlands and expelling a Dutchjournalist. In 1984, the two countries patched things up withthe agreement to ban Dutch sales of weaponry to Taiwan. Aspart of the agreement, both sides agreed to promote tradebetween the two countries.   Dutch officials say China hasn't lived up to the tradepromise, putting the entire pact into question. AlthoughDutch exports to China spurted to 811 million guilders($447.7 million) in 1985 from 540 million guilders in 1984,they have dwindled since then, according to the DutchEconomic Affairs Ministry. It estimates that the exportstotaled just over 400 million guilders last year.   China recently made clear to the Dutch that it wouldstrongly oppose any sale of submarines to Taiwan. But asenior member of Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubber's ChristianDemocrat party said there are signs that China might assuagethe Dutch by trying harder to boost imports from theNetherlands.   A resolution to the issue hinges partly on how the 1984pact is interpreted. Some Dutch officials argue that the pactshouldn't preclude the sale of submarines stripped ofmilitary gear. They say such a sale shouldn't be consideredany more offensive to China than France's sale of frigates toTaiwan last year.</TEXT></DOC>
