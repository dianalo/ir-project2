Several oil companies in Europe and Japan were added to the growing list of Saudi customers who are able to buy the kingdom's petroleum at prices linked to the market values of other crudes. Some of them had stopped taking Saudi oil because they weren't receiving pricing terms as favorable as those given U.S. companies.    According to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Saudi Arabia offered to sell European companies its chief grade of Arab Light at the spot price of North Sea's Brent crude less 70 cents to 80 cents a barrel. That's estimated to be the equivalent of $13.50 to $13.55 a barrel for Arab Light -- officially quoted at $17.52 in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pricing structure.    Similarly, Japanese contract customers were offered Saudi oil at prices linked to the values of Oman and Dubai crudes. An official of one Japanese buyer of Saudi oil said the terms, effective for April purchases, would be accepted.    Although expansion of market-related pricing by Saudi Arabia had been expected, it affected jittery world oil markets -- largely because the kingdom had been the last major holdout in honoring OPEC's fixed-price system and official $18 benchmark.    But the impact yesterday was more than offset by a statement from Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and the president of OPEC, that he will announce new but unspecified measures Tuesday to restore stability to volatile oil markets. That renewed the prospect of an early meeting by OPEC or its five-member price-monitoring committee -- as urged by Venezuela but opposed by Saudi Arabia -- to try to prop up the price of oil through further cuts in production quotas.    The Lukman statement came too late to affect European spot markets, and North Sea Brent crude for April delivery fell 15 cents a barrel to $14.45. But on the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate rallied smartly in last-minute trading to close at $16.28 a barrel, up 28 cents.    The Saudi move raised concern among some in the industry, nevertheless, that the kingdom is reviving the market-share strategy that led to the 1986 oil-price collapse. &quot;The Saudis are trying to crash this market,&quot; said one U.S. crude oil trader.    But it didn't shake the view of others that this year's oil-price slide -- down as much as $4 a barrel since December for some crudes -- has nearly run its course. &quot;Prices are still weak, but we should see strength coming by May or June,&quot; said Paul Mlotok, the Salomon Brothers Inc. international oil analyst who has been predicting that the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, will pass $20 a barrel during the 1988 second half.    A source close to the Saudis said yesterday that the kingdom is only trying to get its production back up to its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. The Saudis have long made clear -- at the highest levels -- that they wouldn't return to their former swing-producer role of adjusting production to changes in the level of demand for OPEC oil. Nevertheless, as previously reported, Saudi oil output recently plunged to about 3.9 million barrels a day, well under the OPEC quota, as several oil companies balked at contracting for the kingdom's oil at official prices.    For several weeks, in a plan to maintain output while wooing back the customers who had deserted, Saudi Arabia has been producing and storing in tankers at sea substantial amounts of unsold oil. The stored oil currently exceeds 20 million barrels, and industry sources said the tankers are parked near the U.S. and Europe markets.    Such &quot;short-haul&quot; supplies figure in the Saudi bargaining with the oil companies. Quick delivery can be promised, and some of the prices being discussed are understood to be on a delivered basis. </TEXT></DOC>
