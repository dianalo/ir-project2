Meanwhile, a survey of year-end bonuses paid on Wall Street shows that bond traders' compensation was down as much as 50% in 1987 compared with the previous year. Investment bankers, on the other hand, generally made as much or more in 1987 as they did in 1986.    In the wake of the October market crash and the sluggish bond trading results of 1987, many firms began layoffs and decided to de-emphasize certain business units. About 12,000 employee layoffs have been announced.    But many Wall Street executives now say privately that more cuts will have to be made if revenues continue to slump. &quot;I think we've got to cut another 10% over the next six months,&quot; says a senior executive at one major securities firm that has already announced a large cutback.    &quot;We didn't cut nearly enough,&quot; says a senior officer of another major firm that has gone through a round of layoffs.    &quot;The business really stinks,&quot; says industry analyst Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. &quot;If the first quarter doesn't rebound, you could see a continuing round of layoffs throughout the rest of the year.&quot;    To date, many of the layoffs have come in back-office computer jobs and in certain unprofitable lines of business, such as municipal securities. A limited number of investment bankers, analysts and traders have been let go. But senior securities industry officials say privately that bankers, traders and analysts will bear the brunt of future cutbacks. And compensation will be much lower, barring any rebound, they say.    Among the problems Wall Streeters cite are a dearth of equity underwritings, sluggish institutional and retail commission income, and lackluster trading markets with little opportunity for big profits. Corporate bond underwriting levels have been strong, but securities firms make very little profit from them.    What's more, many Wall Streeters remain fearful that another Oct. 19 catastrophe could strike, depleting firms' capital and perhaps threatening the survival of some firms.    The one bright spot on the Street is that mergers and acquisitions business seems to be rebounding. One senior investment banker says that activity is now running at about 95% of pre-crash levels.    While highly profitable, Mandamp;A alone isn't enough to sustain most Wall Street firms at their current level of expenses. The firms pay hundreds of investments bankers and traders to price and sell stock offerings. But since Oct. 19, there has been virtually no business. At Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., for example, a powerhouse in stock offerings, there were about 60 deals in the works on Oct. 19. Merrill is only now about to offer the first of these to the market, company officials say.    Uncertainty about the market following the crash has had a sharp effect on transaction volume. According to Mr. Long of Lipper Analytical, the average number of stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other products sold by securities firms to retail and institutional clients is down 18% to 20% since the crash.    While some firms are already contemplating a second round of job cuts, others are still wading through their first. Just last week, First Boston Corp. informed employees that cutbacks are likely, and the firm began letting some people go. One senior official said he thinks the firm will cut as many as 550 people over the next few months. And at Merrill Lynch, where layoffs have been made throughout month, a senior official said he believes the total number will come to 2,500 to 3,000 employees, the high end of previous estimates.    Another example of the changing climate on Wall Street is the shrinking 1987 compensation levels, which come largely from smaller year-end bonuses. In 1986, most firms had robust results in virtually all sectors, and bonuses were up sharply across the board. Not so in 1987.    At Merrill Lynch, for example, senior firm officials say the investment banking bonuses pool was up 10% in 1987. Merrill had more bankers, but the new hires were largely very junior bankers whose total compensation generally remained at about $100,000 to $150,000. Many senior investment bankers, who generally make at least $500,000, also remained flat. Top performers, who generally make as much as $2 million, received the lion's share of the increase, some jumping 20% or more. &quot;Most of the people who got their bonuses would have never known their department was up 10%,&quot; one senior official says.    At the lower end of the scale, Merrill's bonus pool for mortgage, corporate and government bond traders dropped about 50%, officials say. Top traders made more than $1 million in 1986; their compensation was generally around $500,000 in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
