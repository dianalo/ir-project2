Thousands more protested in the southern city of Kwangju todenounce the death of a 24-year-old militant student activist whohad been wanted by police.   Newspapers in Seoul reported that Roh would shuffle part of hisCabinet in June in response to an opposition demand for anextensive government reorgnaization.   About 4,000 radical student representatives from throughout thecountry gathered at a college near Taejon to discuss strategy andprepare nationwide anti-government protests. Student leaders at therally called for the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationedin South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.   Students at the rally chanted ``Punish Yankee imperialism!'' and``Get out, Yankee devils!''   Authorities mobilized 4,000 riot police for the rally atChungnam University, but troopers did not intervene.   In Kwangju, an estimated 7,000 people staged a peaceful protest,demanding that authorities thoroughly investigate the death of LeeChol-kyu, whose body was found Wednesday.   About 3,000 people chanted anti-government slogans outside themorgue where Lee's body lay. About 30 students cut their fingersand wrote ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' in blood on placards.   Dissident groups claim the Chosun University student wastortured and killed by police, but an initial autopsy showed nosigns of torture. Police denied involvement, and Roh has ordered aninquiry.   Police in Kwangju and nearby towns were put on special alert forpossible civil unrest because of Lee's death and a rally plannedfor Saturday.   Lee's death came a week before the anniversary of ananti-government civil uprising in Kwangju in 1980 that left about200 people killed and more than 800 injured, by official count.Dissidents claim the casualty toll was much higher.   Lee's death appeared to fuel anti-government sentiment there.About 7,000 riot police were positioned around campuses and alongmain streets in the city, reports said. No clashes were reported.   Seoul newspapers, quoting unidentified government sources,reported Roh would reshuffle his Cabinet after the NationalAssembly session ends May 29.   During the session, opposition parties demanded Prime MinisterKang Young-hoon and his 22-member Cabinet resign to takeresponsibility for a wave of violent protests that left sixpolicemen dead in a clash with students.   The government would replace some Cabinet members, including thehome and labor ministers, the newspapers said.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-governmentprotests and labor strikes in recent months. Police have rounded upabout 230 radical students, workers and dissidents in the pastmonth.   Radical students and the dissident groups have little supportbecause of their violent tactics and extreme political views. Theradicals have been calling for the overthrow of Roh and thecreation of a leftist state ruled by workers and farmers.</TEXT></DOC>
