Exploitation of biomass to increaseits use as an alternate energy source has certain advantages and disadvantageswhich are discussed in this report. However, it can be successfully exploitedtaking into account purely regional needs and supplies, remembering thatenergy content is relatively low therefore making transport cost an importantfactor in its economical use. Uses may include direct combustion or conversioninto fuels. In the latter respect, the energy-use aspects of ethanoland methanol are discussed in detail. World biomass resources are outlined,with some attention paid to developing countries and the problem of biomassproduction for energy versus biomass production for food. 5 refs., 1fig., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
