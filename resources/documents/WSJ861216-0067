Saker and Foodarama senior managers.    Foodarama cited two holder class action lawsuits contesting the acquisition that were filed in New Jersey courts. The company contended the suits are &quot;without merit,&quot; but conceded that &quot;both Foodarama and the Saker group have mutually concluded that it is unwarranted, in view of the uncertainty as to when the transaction can close, to devote the time and expense and to incur the management distraction necessary to resolve the issues.&quot;    The company's decision came after the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey reinstated a previously dissolved stay against the merger.    In addition to the shareholder suits, the buyout had been challenged by an investment adviser, Marc B. Franklin, of the Palm Desert, Calif., office of Bateman, Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. Mr. Franklin opposed the buyout as undervalued and unfair to minority holders.    Foodarama management had proposed buying out the 51% stake held by the public for a combination of $14.75 cash and $10 face amount of subordinated debentures a share, or about $32 million. However, the debentures wouldn't have accrued interest before late 1990, and were expected to sell at a discount.    In a leveraged buyout, the purchase is financed by borrowing that is later paid off from the acquired concern's operations or asset sales.    Foodarama owns the Shop-Rite chain of supermarkets, liquor stores and garden centers in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.    In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange, Foodarama closed at $17, off $1.625. </TEXT></DOC>
