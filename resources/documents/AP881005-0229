Q: Sen. Bentsen, you have claimed that Vice President Bush andthe Republicans will raid the Social Security trust fund, and youhave vowed to protect it, but as chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, you must know that there is something to the argument ofyour fellow Democrat, Bob Strauss, that some restraint on SocialSecurity growth may be needed, or at least some decision to taxmost Social Security benefits as regular income. In fact, you oncevoted for, and spoke for, a six-month delay on cost-of-livingadjustment increases for Social Security. Senator, aren't you andGov. Dukakis using this issue politically, rather than dealing withit responsibily?   Bentsen: Well, I must say I hate to disappoint my good friend,Bob Strauss, but we have a contract with the American people onSocial Security, and Social Security is an issue where Sen. Quaylevoted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security.   Quayle (interjecting) That's wrong.   Bentsen (continuing) When this administration came in and triedto cut the benefits, the minimum benefits _ $122 a month forwidows, for retirees _ tried to cut the benefits for 62-year-oldretirees by 40 percent, tried to do an end-run on Social Securitywhen they first came in after promising not to cut it, to cut it bysome 20 billion. And while we were working together to reform theSocial Security system and to be certain that that money was goingto be there for people when they retired, at that point they trieda $40 billion end-run to cut Social Security. Now, the record isclear.   And we saw Vice President Bush fly back from the West Coast tobreak a tie in the United States Senate. He doesn't get to votevery often in the Senate but he made a special trip to come backand vote against a cost of living increase. Now, when you talkabout Social Security the people that are going to protect it arethe Democrats who brought forth that program. And I think it's veryimportant that we now see these kinds of end-runs by thisadministration. When they talk about the fact that they're going tocontinue to cut this budget, I know too well what their trackrecord is. And we should be concerned about that kind of an effortonce again after the election is over.   Moderator: Sen. Quayle, your response.   Quayle: Sen. Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut SocialSecurity benefits eight times. What I have voted for, and what Sen.Bentsen has voted for, is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.Sen. Bentsen, two times in the United States Senate, voted to delaythe cost-of-living adjustment. The governor of Massachusetts at agovernors' conference supported a resolution to delay thecost-of-living adjustment.   And, Jon, you're right, they use this for political advantage.What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old peopleof this country. That's the politics of the past. In 1983,Republicans and Democrats dropped their political swords and, in abipartisan effort, saved the Social Security system. Republicansand Democrats banded together because we know that this program isnot a Republican program, it's not a Democrat program; it's aprogram for older Americans. And that program is actuarially soundto the turn of this century.   MORE</TEXT><TEXT>   hjh</TEXT></DOC>
