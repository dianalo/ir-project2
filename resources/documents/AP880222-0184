Among Democratic hopefuls, money leader Michael Dukakis had a $4million bankroll, his financial statement shows.   Robertson reported $5.5 million in loans and contributions of$1.3 million during January, in addition to the $6.5 million he gotin federal matching funds. Robertson had earlier said he might notuse the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed tothe public financing system.   He ended the month with $5.5 million in cash on hand, secondonly to Bush's warchest, but Robertson had an outstanding debt of$6 million.   Robertson's campaign did not immediately return calls Mondayevening to answer questions about where he got the loan or what itwas for.   In an interesting twist, Bush, while raising the most money, hasactually spent less against the overall primary season spendinglimit than any of the other Republican contenders, including thestruggling campaign of Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.   The Bush forces have been carefully husbanding their resourcesto ensure they don't reach the $27 million limit too early in thenominating campaign, thereby shorting themselves for the conteststhat come after the Super Tuesday races on March 8.   The latest campaign figures are contained in reports filed overthe weekend with the Federal Election Commission. The reports covertotals for the month of January.   As of Jan. 31, the vice president had spent $10.7 millionagainst the $27 million cap, compared to Kemp's $12.8 million. Sen.Bob Dole, R-Kan., had spent $13.5 million and ended January with$4.2 million in the bank.   Robertson reported spending a whopping $17.5 million against thecap, and his report showed heavy expenditures across the SuperTuesday states, topped by more than $1 million spent in Texas. Bycontrast, Bush spent $335,743 in Texas, Dole spent $81,645 there,and Kemp spent $11,312.   On the Democratic side, none of the candidates were approachingthat level, with Dukakis spending the most against the ceiling, at$7.8 million.   Kemp continued to squeak by financially, taking out $750,000worth of loans in January and ending the month with a debt of $1.3million. Kemp hoped to pay that off with the help of nearly$600,000 in government matching funds he expects to receive by theend of this month, said campaign political director Charlie Black.   Kemp aides are relying on a heavy mail solicitation which hasbrought in a steady flow of money in recent weeks, including mostof the $1 million Kemp raised in January, he said. Kemp is nettingabout $400,000 a week in fund-raising, Black said.   Black insisted the campaign is not in serious financial trouble,though he conceded, ``Sure, I'd like to have another couple millionto spend on Super Tuesday.'' He said he has budgeted about $1.5million for the campaign through Super Tuesday, and is spendingbetween $250,000 and $300,000 on television for South Carolina'sMarch 5 primary.   Black said that Kemp's spending against the overall limit is nota problem because he will buy TV time in only seven Super Tuesdaystates.   Among the Democrats, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Rep.Richard Gephardt of Missouri both ended January in debt, and had totake out loans to keep their campaigns afloat in February's Iowacaucuses and New Hampshire primary.   Simon took out a $523,674 loan in January, and ended the monthwith a $691,069 debt and only $401,176 in the bank.   Gephardt did not report any January loans but, according toaides, did borrow money this month. He entered February with$820,260 in debts and $172,477 in cash on hand.   Democrats Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, and Sen.Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, on the other hand, were in good shape_ Dukakis with $4 million in the bank and $511,789 in bills to payoff, and Gore with $2 million on hand and $84,248 in obligations.   Gore ignored the Iowa race to concentrate on the Super Tuesdaystates, but he raised very little money during the time the othercandidates were campaigning hard in Iowa and New Hampshire. Hecollected only $180,746 in contributions during January, inaddition to the $1.8 million in matching funds he got, his reportshowed.   Dukakis raised $804,839 in contributions and got $3.5 millionmatching funds.   Most candidates got very large matching fund payments inJanuary, the first month the government funds were released, andthe sums were based on the candidates' fund-raising for allpreceding months. Candidates can receive matching funds from thefederal Treasury for every contribution of $250 or less. The fundis supported by the $1 checkoff on individual tax returns.   Democratic contender Jesse Jackson reported raising $610,036 indonations, plus $598,021 in matching funds during January, endingthe month with $509,978 in cash on hand and $354,881 in obligations.   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart ended the month with $615,547 incash on hand after collecting $70,303 in contributions and $937,325in matching funds.   Simon's finance director, Bob Edgar, announced that the senatorhas raised more than $1 million in donations so far this year, andin the two weeks following the Feb. 8 Iowa contest set a record forhis campaign.   His report shows that in January he raised $534,259 incontributions, $1.9 million in matching funds, and $523,674 inloans.   Gephardt collected $212,702 in contributions and $1.9 million inmatching funds. Gephardt's campaign manager, Bill Carrick, has saidthat the congressman will not buy TV advertising in all 20 SuperTuesday states, but will concentrate on Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana,Oklahoma and Florida.   As of the Jan. 31 report, however, Gephardt had spent verylittle in those states _ for example, a total of $69,809 in Texas,compared to Dukakis' $301,829, and $23,454 in Florida, compared toDukakis' $206,861 there.   In Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, Gephardt had spent lessthan $5,000 each as of the beginning of this month.   Dukakis has also far outspent Gore in the South, a region inwhich the Tennessee senator has pinned his presidential hopes.</TEXT></DOC>
