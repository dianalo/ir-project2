Most of the participants at the 68-nation conference on globalwarming adopted a declaration saying that carbon dioxide emissionsshould be stabilized within 10 years as a first step towardfighting the pollution problem.   Environmentalists were bitter about the refusal of the UnitedStates, Soviet Union and Japan to sign the declaration.   ``The conference is a total failure, and the United States andJapan have sabotaged it,'' said Daniel Becker, an official of theSierra Club, a Washington-based environmentalist group.   The Dutch, hosts of the two-day ministerial meeting, had hopedto align all the participating nations unanimously behind acommitment to stabilize emissions by the end of the century and tobegin reducing them in 2005.   William K. Reilly, chief administrator of the U.S. Environmentalprotection agency, said the ``distinction was between thosecountries that want to commit themselves to stabilization by theyear 2000 and those, including the United States, who are notprepared to say so at this time.''   On Monday, Reilly said, ``We believe in a reduction of carbondioxide. But we're not prepared to say by what time and by whatlevel.''   Reilly said the countries should wait for completion of studiesby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a forum trying tofind ways of reducing global warming.   The level at which the emissions were to be stabilized will beset next year by the U.N.-sponsored climate change panel, which isplanning a meeting in Washington in February, and the World ClimateConference scheduled for late 1990, according to the nations'declaration.   Earlier, Japanese delegates said they were awaiting morescientific data on climate change and on the economic effects ofdrastic measures to curb the greenhouse effect, which is believedby some scientists to be the cause of a slight warming of theearth's atmosphere.   Some scientists fear the phenomenon could eventually lead to theflooding of coastal areas and expansion of deserts.   Carbon dioxide is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect.In 1988, the United States accounted for nearly 24 percent of totalworld emissions of the gas, according to the Dutch EnvironmentMinistry. Much carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fuelssuch as coal and gasoline.   The final declaration also called for ways to provide money toThird World nations to help them cope with the consequences ofclimatic change.   Participating nations also said that by the end of the century,an annual 30-million acre reforestation program should be under wayin the tropics. The destruction of rain forest is believed tocontribute to the greenhouse effect.</TEXT></DOC>
