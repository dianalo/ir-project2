He's less sure about the timing.    &quot;It's going to happen before I die of old age,&quot; jokes Mr. Hershman, 49 years old, the owner of a graphic-arts business in Irvine, Calif.    Last year he put $5,000 of his $500,000 portfolio in an oil and natural gas income partnership sponsored by Merrico Resources Inc. He is happy with his 1987 payout rate of 10% and plans to increase his investment this year in the hope of big oil price increases down the road.    Already, he has plenty of company. Investment in oil and gas income funds surged 71% last year to nearly $1 billion, according to Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., investment firm that tracks partnerships.    But some people caution that the gyrations of oil and natural gas prices make for a great deal of uncertainty for years to come. &quot;We operate -- and will continue to operate -- in an extremely volatile market,&quot; says Constantine S. Nicandros, president and chief executive of Conoco Inc. Because the partnerships' quarterly payouts hinge on market prices -- which currently are depressed -- that volatility will trickle down to partnership investors.    The protracted troubles of Petro-Lewis Corp. -- along with the loss, under tax overhaul, of huge write-offs once provided by some drilling funds -- gave oil and gas partnerships a bad name over the past few years. But most of the 18 or so oil income funds operating today say they don't make two mistakes that contributed to PetroLewis's problems before it was taken over: They don't guarantee distribution rates, and they can't borrow to make distributions. PaineWebber Inc., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and other current fund sponsors also seek to reduce risk by buying only proven petroleum reserves, not speculative properties.    Many investors, like Mr. Hershman, buy oil income funds as an inflation hedge. They note a tax benefit, too: Depletion allowances for oil and gas properties are passed along to limited partners.    But analysts offer several caveats. For one, although oil income funds generally set a distribution goal of 15% to 20% a year, that's only a target. Moreover, the assets backing the funds -- oil and gas in the ground -- are continually being depleted. When the oil is gone, the partners' principal is gone too.    &quot;A lot of people look at an 18% distribution and say, 'That's great,'&quot; says Nancy Schabel, a Stanger andamp; Co. official. &quot;But part of that is return on your capital, and part is return of your capital.&quot;    Moreover, the funds' oil fields have life spans of roughly 10 to 15 years, and they tend to produce most in their early years. So, the high yields of a new fund are likely to decline as the reserves diminish.    In addition, most funds have hefty front-end fees of 15%, and the partnership units are relatively illiquid.    Partnership officials say people looking to invest in a fund should make sure that the general partner has a good record in picking oil properties. That's because buying the right property at the right price isn't easy, they say.    &quot;You've got to evaluate them right, and you've got to operate them right,&quot; says A. Earl Swift, chairman of Swift Energy Co., a fund sponsor.    Fund sponsors say they are buying properties that will generate a profit at current low oil and gas prices. For instance, Ward Merrick III, president of Ardmore, Okla.-based Merrico, says yields on his funds now run about 18%; about two-thirds of that represents profit, the rest a return of principal.    Mr. Merrick says yields like those can be maintained if oil prices stay in a range of $15 to $20 a barrel. And even if prices plunge to $10 and stay there, he says, investors will at least get their principal back -- though perhaps without much return to show for their 10 to 15 years in the funds.    On the other hand, if oil prices surge, the potential for really big profit would be great, sponsors say. Many economists say prices will rise in the long term -- but few expected prices to tumble by more than half in 1986, as they did.    Because many partnerships invest heavily in natural gas, gas prices may be as important to the funds' returns as oil prices. As with oil, many economists consider gas prices likely to rise substantially at some point, but their forecasts leave plenty of room for uncertainty. </TEXT></DOC>
