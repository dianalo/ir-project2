The African National Congress, which had previously raisedobjections to the planned $100 million five-year issue,criticized both the IDT and its underwriter, J.P. MorganSecurities Ltd., for issuing what it called a &quot;bogus&quot; jointstatement that characterized the ANC's disapproval as merelya &quot;misunderstanding.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The ANC, which is seeking equal rights for South Africanblacks, said its objections had been made clear in a letterto J.P. Morgan officials yesterday.   The ANC said &quot;the granting of loans to the IndependentDevelopment Trust will undermine financial sanctions, whichremain an important part of the sanctions campaign againstapartheid.&quot;   IDT's chairman, Jan Steyn, said the bond issue &quot;needs thesupport of all the interested parties in South Africa&quot; to bea success. But he wouldn't say whether the IDT would withdrawthe bond issue if the ANC doesn't drop its objections. SomeANC support groups label the IDT issue as &quot;funding throughthe back door&quot; for the South African government. Today, theSouth African Council of Churches called for the continuedisolation of South Africa and its agencies from theinternational capital markets.</TEXT></DOC>
