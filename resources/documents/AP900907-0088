Swami Devageet said Rajneesh, the mystic who was expelled fromthe United States in 1985 and died in January, discovered a yearago that ``man's animal past, including his aggressive instincts,are mysteriously stored in the human dental structure.''   In a telex from the commune that Rajneesh founded in Poona,Devageet said Saddam could become ``a blissful human being insteadof a blistering warmonger'' if he submitted to tooth-centeredcharacter analysis.   ``It may sound absurd, but it's a lot cheaper than a third WorldWar,'' Devageet said.</TEXT></DOC>
