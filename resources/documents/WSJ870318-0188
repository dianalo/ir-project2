Purchasing power has been weak in the Mideast because of lower oil prices over the past year and in Southeast Asia because of falling prices for oil and other commodities.    Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, said exports declined 3.8% in February from a year earlier, to 141,895 vehicles. Its domestic sales rose 2.2%, however, to 142,248 units, a record for the month. Production declined 4.4%, to 296,965 units.    Nissan's exports fell 15.4%, to 101,374 vehicles. Domestic sales inched up 0.8%, to 84,240 vehicles, and production increased 9%, to 207,823 units. </TEXT></DOC>
