And not a bad call at that, with a hilarious Michael Keatonstarring in the title role of this wacky film which pokes fun atlife and death in the 1980s, and leaves you puzzled whether there'sany important difference between those two states.   ``Beetlejuice'' opens with Adam and Barbara Maitland perishingwhen they drive their standard-issue yuppie Volvo stationwagon offa wooden bridge. Upon dying, the first thing they learn is that thecrucial difference between life and death is that ghosts seem toassume pastel tones and dress more flamboyantly.   They then learn that they are to spend the next 125 yearshaunting the home they so lovingly decorated. That sounds OK atfirst. But that fate turns hellish when an upscale Manhattan couplenamed Deetz and their death-obsessed daughter move in and threatenthe decor with the most tacky taste imaginable states may have higher agerestrictions.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
