New regulations, due by month's end, target what many considerthe crux of the problem: profit-making vocational schools thatsurvive primarily on student financial aid and have a loan defaultrate three times the 12 percent national average.   These private schools train people in everything fromcosmetology and truck driving to business and commercial art.Although their students receive only about a quarter of allfederally guaranteed loans, such schools account for 40 percent ofall defaulted loan dollars.   The regulations, from Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, willprescribe a series of increasingly tough actions against schoolsdepending on their default rates, with those above 35 or 40 percentin line for the most stringent treatment.   Former Education Secretary William Bennett favored aharsher-sounding plan to start automatic proceedings to limit,suspend or terminate participation by schools with default ratesabove 20 percent. Some 2,354 institutions, more than half of themprofit-making vocational schools, fall into that category.   Education Department officials, citing administrative problemswith the Bennett plan, say the graduated Cavazos approach isactually stronger medicine.   ``I can assure you that more of the shoddy schools with defaultproblems will feel more pain sooner under what Lauro Cavazos isdoing than they would have under the Bennett proposal,'' saiddeputy undersecretary Charles Kolb.   Stories of exploitation and abuse by unscrupulous trade schooloperators have been rampant for years, with students routinelydepicted as victims of shady recruiting techniques and shoddyeducation.   Witnesses at congressional and other legislative hearings havedescribed students incapable of doing the coursework, whether fromlow IQs, illiteracy or having virtually no knowledge of English.Those that can learn sometimes receive little training in theskills they signed up to study.   Students often drop out of a program with nothing to show fortheir efforts except a debt of $2,500 or more. Even graduates canfind they lack the skills they need to compete in the job market.   Proprietary school associations protest that their members arebeing unjustly tainted by a few bad apples. At the same time,however, they are moving to tighten accreditation procedures,upgrade admissions standards and promote loan default managementplans.   Department officials contend that high default rates are a signof bad school management. Career school executives counter thatsuch rates reflect instead the poor, urban, academically riskystudents served by many of their institutions as well as a lack ofdiligence on the part of outside loan collectors.   ``You can have a high default rate and a superb school,'' saidStephen Blair, president of the National Association of Trade andTechnical Schools and a former loan program official at theEducation Department.   Another proprietary group, the Association of IndependentColleges and Schools, argues that if just one at-risk studentsucceeds because of a guaranteed student loan, the long-term savingto society covers the cost of 65 defaults.   Some 4.4 million students borrowed nearly $12 billion inguaranteed loans last year to pursue postsecondary education atcolleges, universities and private career schools. Defaults lastyear totaled $1.6 billion _ nearly half the annual federal cost ofthe program. The default figure is expected to reach $1.8 billionthis year and rise even higher after that.   Taxpayers are not the only ones shelling out to cover defaults;lenders are becoming vulnerable as well.   The most expensive foul-up ever occurred earlier this year inCalifornia when federal guarantees on loans worth $1.4 billion werevoided by a loan servicing company's failure to follow propercollection procedures. Nine major U.S. and foreign banks sued lastmonth in an attempt to make the loan trustee, the Bank of America,take responsibility for their losses, which could reach $650million.   In addition to requiring certain steps of schools with soaringdefault rates, officials said the department's combination of newrules, administrative actions and legislative proposals may include:   _Pro-rata refunds to victimized students.   _Disclosure of the track records of vocational schools,including completion and job placement rates, to inform prospectivestudents, promote competition and alert the department to problemschools.   _Mandatory loan counseling for all first-time student borrowers.   _More stringent requirements to determine if students withouthigh school diplomas or their equivalent, who are permitted toborrow money for some programs, can truly benefit from thecoursework.   _Some way to curb unethical recruitment practices, includingpie-in-the-sky pitches made outside prisoner rehabilitationprograms, welfare offices and drug treatment centers.   _Incentives for states to institute systems to garnish wages,thereby avoiding costly litigation against defaulters who have jobs.   _Tighter monitoring of schools and guarantors by the department,which is currently investigating and prosecuting a wide range ofabuses.   The department's inspector general, James B. Thomas Jr.,recently told Congress that one company, Continental TrainingServices Inc., with headquarters in Indianapolis, enrolled studentswho were not proficient in English.   In addition, Thomas said, ``Individuals who had physicaldisabilities which would prevent them from driving a truck or fromobtaining a license to do so were enrolled. Individuals wereenrolled who could not get licenses because of prior driving orcriminal records. ...''   Thomas said employees at Hausman Computer Associates of New YorkCity ``created high school diplomas for students who were not highschool graduates to make them appear to be eligible for federalstudent aid.''   At La Tee's Beauty School in Chicago, he said, ``time cards,state inspection records and sign-in sheets are examples of recordsfalsified to reflect attendance when the `student' was actuallyincarcerated, was on a leave of absence or had dropped out ofclass.''   Angelo Aponte, New York City's commissioner of consumer affairs,told a state legislative committee in March about an auto mechanictraining course that had no cars and little equipment. ``Studentsonly got a chance to work on cars if a student's car neededrepairs,'' he said.   Aponte said the education director of the Fortune Society, whichhelps ex-prison inmates, told him she met daily with ex-offendersabout to enroll in courses they could not possibly complete.   ``Why would one admit a third-grade reader into a computerprogramming course?'' Aponte quoted her as asking. ``Or tell a manwith a fourth-grade math level that in six months he'll be applyingfor a job as an accountant? Why would anyone give potentialstudents the answers to admissions tests, or tell them they will beadmitted anyway even if they fail the test? And why would anyoneoperate a computer programming course without a computer on thepremises?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 21</NOTE></DOC>
