The March 27 documentdealt with the establishment of hunting seasons, hours, areas and limitsfor migratory game birds under andSection;andSection; 20.101 through 20.107,20.109 and 20.110 of subpart K. On June 6, 1989, the Service publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 24290) a second document consisting ofa supplemental proposed rulemaking dealing with both the early- and late-seasonframeworks. On July 13, 1989, the Service published for public commentin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 29640) a third document consisting ofa proposed rulemaking dealing specifically with frameworks for early-seasonmigratory bird hunting regulations. On August 11, 1989, the Service publisheda fourth document (54 FR 32975) containing final frameworks for early migratorybird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officialsfrom the States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands selected early-seasonhunting dates, hours, areas and limits for 1989-90. The fifth documentin the series, published August 16, 1989, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 33721), deals specifically with proposedframeworks for the 1989-90 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations.On August 30, 1989, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 36008) a sixth document consisting ofa final rule amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set huntingseasons, hours, areas and limits for mourning, white-winged and white-tippeddoves; band-tailed pigeons; rails; moorhens and gallinules; woodcock; commonsnipe; sea ducks in certain defined areas of the Atlantic Flyway; experimentalSeptember duck seasons in identified States; experimental and special SeptemberCanada goose seasons in portions of identified States; sandhill cranesin the Central and Pacific Flyways; doves in Hawaii; migratory game birdsin Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; and some extended falconryseasons. On September 19, 1989, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a seventh document (54 FR 38614) consisting ofa final rulemaking for the late-season frameworks for migratory game birdhunting regulations from which State wildlife conservation agency officialsselected late-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1989-90.The final rule described here is the eighth in a series of proposed, supplemental,and final rulemaking documents for migratory game bird hunting regulationsand deals specifically with amending subpart K of 50 CFR part 20 to sethunting seasons, hours, areas and limits for species subject to late huntingregulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Nontoxic Shot Regulations</ITAG>In the April 13, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 14814), the Service published a finalrule describing zones in which lead shot is prohibited for hunting waterfowl,coots and certain other species in the 1989-90 season. Waterfowl huntersare advised to become familiar with State and local regulations regardingthe use of nontoxic shot for waterfowl hunting.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration</ITAG>NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final SupplementalEnvironmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permittingthe Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14)'', filed with EPA onJune 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service'sRecord of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). However,this programmatic document does not prescribe year-specific regulations;those are developed annually. The annual regulations and options were consideredin the Environmental Assessment, <T3>Waterfowl Hunting Regulations for 1989.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration</ITAG>On June 22, 1989, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservationconcluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modificationof their critical habitats.Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviatechances of conflict between seasons for migratory game birds and the protectionand conservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitats.The Service's biological opinion resulting from its consultation undersection 7 is considered a public document and is available for inspectionin the Office of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation and the Officeof Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Room 634,Arlington Square, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291, and the PaperworkReduction Act</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12534), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparinga Determination of Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis,and publication of a summary of the latter. These regulations have beendetermined to be major under Executive Order 12291 and they have a significanteconomic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This determination is detailed in the aforementioned documentswhich are available upon request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Room 634, Arlington Square, Departmentof the Interior, Washington, DC 20240. These proposed regulations containno information collections subject to Office of Management and Budget reviewunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.<ITAG tagnum="84">Memorandum of Law</ITAG>The Service published its Memorandum of Law, required by section 4 of ExecutiveOrder 12291, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated August 11, 1989 (54 FR 32975).<ITAG tagnum="84">Authorship</ITAG>The primary author of this proposed rule is Morton M. Smith, Office ofMigratory Bird Management, working under the direction of Byron K. Williams,Acting Chief.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Promulgation</ITAG>After analysis of the migratory game bird survey data obtained throughinvestigations conducted by the Service, State conservation agencies, andother sources, and consideration of all comments received on the late-seasonproposals, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 19, 1989 (54 FR 38614) final late-seasonframeworks. Copies of the proposed and final frameworks were sent to theofficials of the State conservation agencies who were invited to submitrecommendations for hunting seasons which complied with the season timesand lengths, hours, areas, and limits specified in the final frameworks.The Service has long recognized, consistent with 16 U.S.C. 708, that Statesneed not select maximum bag limits and season length delineated in annualFederal frameworks. Local resource needs and the health of portions ofa population using a particular area may require stricter local controlsthan prevail elsewhere in a flyway.The taking of migratory birds is prohibited unless specifically provided.The following amendments will permit taking of the designated species withinspecific time periods beginning as early as September 23 and will benefitthe public by relieving existing restrictions.The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting, must, by its nature,operate under severe time constraints. However, the Service intends thatthe public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment on theregulations. Thus, when proposed rulemakings were published on March 27,June 6, and August 16, 1989, the Service established what it believed werethe longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, the Servicerecognized that when the comment period closed time would be of the essence.That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulationsafter this final rulemaking, the States would have insufficient time toselect their season dates, shooting hours, hunting areas, and limits; tocommunicate those selections to the Service; and to establish and publicizethe necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions.The Service therefore finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the termsof 5 U.S.C. (d)(3) (Administrative Procedures Act), and these regulationswill, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication.Accordingly, each State conservation agency having had an opportunity toparticipate in selecting the hunting seasons desired for its State on thosespecies of migratory birds for which open seasons are now to be prescribed,and consideration having been given to all other relevant matters presented,certain sections of title 50, chapter I, subchapter B, part 20, subpartK, are hereby corrected and amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20</ITAG>Exports, Hunting, Imports, Transportation, Wildlife.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 20_[AMENDED]</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, title 50, chapter I, subchapterB, part 20, subpart K is amended as follows.1.
