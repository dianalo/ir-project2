(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Donald Trump owes $3.2 billion tobanks, $69.5 milion to subcontractors who helped build the TajMahal casino and is involved in 111 court cases, according todocuments released Wednesday.   The documents also reveal that several of Trump's marqueeproperties, including the Taj Mahal and the Plaza Hotel inManhattan, may be worth hundreds of millions of dollars less thanhe claims.   The asset analysis by the firm Kenneth Leventhal andamp; Co. was amongdocuments released by the state Casino Control Commission inadvance of hearings Thursday and Friday over a $65 million rescueplan Trump reached with creditors in June.   The papers _ which Trump unsuccessfully fought to keep private _give some of the most detailed information yet about the troubleddeveloper's holdings and the rescue plan.   They also cover such matters as lawsuits and other court actionby aggrieved parties ranging from his estranged wife Ivana to theNew Jersey State Funeral Directors.   Under the rescue plan, Trump gave up substantial control of hisreal estate and hotel empire in exchange for a debt restructuringthat kept his holdings out of bankruptcy.   Leventhal's report, based on figures as of April 30, said Trumpcontrolled $4.6 billion in assets with a market value of $3.7billion to $3.9 billion and a short-term liquidation value of $2.9billion to $3.5 billion.   The severity of Trump's financial problems began surfacing inJune, after he missed a $43 million payment on bonds used tofinance Trump Castle Casino Resort By the Bay and payments on a $30million bank loan.   The documents state that Trump has outstanding debts of $3.2billion to lending institutions, including $933 million to Citibank.   Trump already has pledged his three Atlantic City casinos _Trump Castle, the Taj Mahal Casino Resort and Trump Plaza Hotel andCasino _ as collateral for new loans granted under the rescue plan.   Trump put up his equity in the Taj Mahal as a guarantee of anexisting $75 million loan by First Fidelity Bancorp.; his equity inTrump Castle to secure an existing $13 million loan by MidlanticBank; and his equity in Trump Plaza to secure a $19.6 millionletter of credit from National Westminster Bancorp.   The restructuring also defers payments on some of theoutstanding bonds for the three casinos and his Manhattanproperties for three and five years.   Trump spokesman Norma Foerderer said Trump would have no commenton the documents.   A cover letter on the on the report prepared for Trump's lendersby Leventhal asked the commission to keep details of therestructuring plan confidential.   ``This report contains highly confidential and sensitiveinformation which is vital to Donald J. Trump,'' the letter said.``Dissemination or disclosure of any or all the contents of thisreport could adversely affect those interests.''   The rescue plan also requires Trump to sell some assets to raisecash, although there has been speculation that such transactionscould amount to a ``fire sale'' because some values were depressed.   The major assets listed by Trump, with the value he assigns tothem, the going market rate estimated by Leventhal and theshort-term liquidation value estimated by Leventhal were:   _ Taj Mahal and adjacent land: $1.06 billion, $767.5 million,and $740.7 million.   _ Trump Plaza, the land under it and the adjacent land: $647.8million, $555.2 million to $655.2 million, and between $412.4million and $642.4 million.   _ Trump Castle: $571.5 million, $400 million to $460 million,and $300 million to $350 million.   _ The Plaza Hotel in Manhattan: $830 million, $450 million to$550 million, and $413.2 million to $500 million.   _ The Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan: $150 million, $90 millionto $110 million, and $80 million to $100 million.   _ The Trump Shuttle airline: $340 million, $340 million, and$150 million to $300 million.   Also included was a 29-page list of 111 legal matters involvingTrump. They included lawsuits filed by Ivana Trump and by formersecurities analyst Marvin Roffman, who claimed he was fired due tocomplaints by Trump. Another complaint was filed by the New JerseyState Funeral Directors charging an alleged breach of a bookingagreement at a Trump casino.   Trump also owes $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors who workedon the Taj Mahal on projects from installing minarets andchandeliers to bathroom fixtures. The subcontractors who have notsued Trump for payment are negotiating with him for payment.   Trump's attorneys lost an appeal Wednesday to keep the documentssealed. State Supreme Court Justice Alan Handler upheld a two-judgeappellate panel's decision, rejecting Trump's argument that releaseof the documents would cause him undue harm.</TEXT></DOC>
