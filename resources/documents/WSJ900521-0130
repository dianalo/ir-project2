Weber's otherwise excellent editorial-pagearticle, &quot;America's Own Fixed-Exchange Model,&quot; April 26, hasthe defect that it fosters confusion between twofundamentally different monetary systems: a unified currencyand a system of national currencies linked to one another atpegged exchange rates.   A unified currency may have different names in differentplaces: during the heyday of the gold standard, a pound inBritain, a dollar in the U.S.; currently, in the example usedby Mr. Weber, an A dollar, a B dollar for dollars issued bydifferent Federal Reserve districts.</LP><TEXT>   The key feature that defines a unified currency is thatthere is either no (the gold standard) or at most one (theU.S. today) monetary authority authorized to issue fiat money-- that is the translation of Mr. Weber's requirement thatthere be &quot;an agreement among countries about the amount ofseigniorage and its distribution.&quot; Stated differently, for afiat currency to be unified, there must be only one centralbank, though it can have any number of branches -- the U.S.Federal Reserve System has 12. That requirement is easy tostate; it is exceedingly difficult to achieve on a worldscale. We shall, I predict, wait a long time before the U.S.,Britain, Germany, France and Japan are all willing to converttheir national central banks into branches of a world centralbank -- and, I may say, as a U.S. citizen, I would beextremely opposed to doing so.   In the absence of the effective elimination of nationalcentral banks, any &quot;agreement among countries about theamount of seigniorage and its distribution&quot; will degenerateinto a Bretton Woods-pegged exchange-rate system, which wouldinevitably break down as Bretton Woods did.   Incidentally, a unified currency does not require orinvolve literally fixed exchange rates. Before the FederalReserve System was established, the U.S. had a unifiedcurrency internally, yet there was a market in St. Louis, totake one example, for &quot;New York dollars.&quot; The only reasonsuch markets do not exist currently is because the FederalReserve (i.e., the taxpayer) pays the transactions costs forregional transfers of funds. Similarly, during thegold-standard period, the exchange rate between the Britishpound and the U.S. dollar varied within a range, the limitsof which were set by the costs of transporting gold to orfrom Britain.   A unified currency has many desirable features, but is notat present a feasible alternative on any world-wide basis. Asystem of national currencies linked by pegged exchange rateshas many undesirable features, yet it is a far more feasibleoption under current circumstances.
