It's early in thesession,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Thursday after theSenate approved the measure, 81-17, and sent it to the House.   The bill was originally designed to cap immigration at 600,000 ineach of the next three years but was expanded to include room for30,000 new arrivals annually before final passage. The ceilingrepresents 136,000 more visas than were issued last year.   Critics say the bill still could reduce visas for all but theclosest relatives of American citizens and permanent residents ofthe United States.   The House killed a similar measure in 1988, but sponsors are morehopeful about their chances this year.   Kennedy and co-sponsor Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said they havealready received encouragement from House leaders.   ``We've never given them anything like this this early,'' Simpsonsaid.   Simpson expressed concerns about changes the bill underwentbefore passage, but said it was ``time to face the unfortunate buthideously cold reality that there are many more people who want tocome here than there is room or intent to accommodate them.''   Simpson praised provisions that reserved 120,000 of the annualvisas for individuals who do not have family ties in America but whowould be likely to make significant contributions in business,sciences or other areas.   The Senate added a provision that would allow entry to spousesand minor children of those who achieved legal status under the 1986amnesty program for illegal aliens.   The thrust of the bill does not relate to illegal aliens, but theSenate attached a number of riders that focused on the politicallyvolatile subject.   The Senate voted 78-21 to raise the ceiling by 30,000 visasannually after Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., recalled how his fatherfled czarist Russia in 1911 and arrived in America ``with no rublesin his pocket, he had to come steerage.''   Further efforts at expansion, however, were rejected.   The Senate did approve an amendment from Sen. Richard C. Shelby,D-Ala., that would force the Census Bureau to halt its practice ofincluding illegal aliens in its official count. Proponents wereconcerned that states with many aliens would get an unfair edge incongressional remaps following next year's census.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said that under the current system``states like California would gain a (congressional) seat at NorthCarolina's expense.''   Among those entering for reasons other than family ties, 54,000visas annually are subject to a point system giving credit for thosewith special skills who do not have employers ready to sponsor them.   The Judiciary Committee deleted a provision that would provideextra points to individuals who speak English. Simpson appealed tothe Senate in vain to restore the point system but lawmakersrejected the idea, 56-43.   Meanwhile, the House approved, 358-44, and sent to the Senateseparate legislation to ease immigration of certain Soviet andSoutheast Asian refugees.   It would temporarily re-establish the legal status of Soviet Jewsand evangelical Christians as well as certain categories ofVietnamese, Laotians and Cambodians as persecuted without having toprove it in each individual case. That would aid them in obtainingstanding as refugees.   The measure is opposed by the Bush administration, which contendsit unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certainrefugees and makes it more difficult to fairly administer the U.S.refugee program.</TEXT></DOC>
