The state grand-jury indictments announced yesterday follow a two-year investigation by state officials, the U.S. Labor Department and other agencies into corruption in the city's carpentry and drywall industries.    According to Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and Ronald Goldstock, head of the state's Organized Crime Task Force, those charged include two business agents and the chief steward of Local 608, the largest carpenters union local in the U.S., with 5,600 members; the president and vice president of Local 257; and a former business agent for Local 2155 who is now a district council first vice president.    A Local 608 business agent, John F. O'Connor, was charged with 127 counts of accepting bribes and gratuities and coercing payments -- under threats of labor unrest -- of as much as $4,000 at a time from 17 different contractors from 1980 to 1986. Mr. O'Connor, 51 years old, also was charged with directing $30,000 of damage to work done by nonunion workers on a restaurant under construction in the city's Battery Park City development. The indictment supersedes a more-limited one issued last year.    One of the other Local 608 officials was charged with extortion and the third was charged with perjury in connection with the restaurant incident.    The president and vice president of Local 257 were charged in a 79-count indictment with conspiracy, larceny and receiving bribes.    The district council official and former business agent for Local 2155 was charged with 11 counts of accepting illegal gratuities.    Mr. O'Connor and the other defendants pleaded innocent to the charges and were released pending trial.    Mr. Morgenthau said yesterday's indictments are the first filed by his office's new Labor Racketeering Unit, formed earlier this year to combat labor corruption. He and Mr. Goldstock said further indictments charging corruption in the carpentry industry are expected. </TEXT></DOC>
