Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Akhoond Zadeh Basti made his commentsas the first British lawmakers to visit Iran since the monarchy wasoverthrown in 1979 returned to London. The legislators said Tehranwill use its influence with the kidnappers.   They called the mission a success, but said they could not raisethe question of American hostages because of intense hostility inIran toward the United States.   The Independent newspaper reported Wednesday that Syria haslocated the hiding place for 15 foreign hostages believed held bythe Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Shiite Moslemslums of south Beirut.   It added, however, that the Syrians said the hostages cannot berescued by force and negotiations with Hezbollah are needed.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redmansaid: ``That report is not new. We have never been able to confirmthe exact location of the hostages and we cannot confirm thislatest report.   ``Although information on the hostages is conflicting and rarelyreliable we have always believed that some of them are in Beirut'ssouthern suburbs.''   Eighteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. Held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985, and is reported to be among the 15.   Basti was asked on Channel 4 television news whether diplomaticprogress could mean the release of the three Britons held _Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, journalist John McCarthy andteacher Brian Keenan.   ``I'm very optimistic about the process that has been initiated... and I believe that there are wonderful areas where the twocountries can talk, can discuss, and I believe that theopportunities are ample,'' he replied.   Asked whether it would take months or years, Basti said:   ``Let us not be hasty. Let us welcome the initiatives as theytake their own course. I think that one has got to be veryoptimistic in the context of the latest diplomatic move.   Both governments reduced their diplomatic representation tocaretaker status last year, but on June 10 announced agreement toexchange compensation for damaged embassy buildings that will netIran about $1.8 million.   On Sunday, the British legislators flew to Tehran on a privatemission organized by Waite's boss, Archbishop of Canterbury RobertRuncie.   ``I think our mission was a success,'' said Conservativelawmaker Cyril Townsend, delegation leader. By talking to ``seniormembers of the administration, we played some part in putting therelationship on a better basis,'' he said.   ``The timing was really rather good because since aboutFebruary, the pragmatists in the government have been looking for achance, in my view, to patch up the quarrel between our twocountries.''   Townsend said the delegation met with Alireza Moayyeri, deputyprime minister; Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karroubi, deputy parliamentspeaker, and Mohammed Javad Larijani, deputy foreign minister.   A church official, John Lyttle, was allowed to visit RogerCooper, a British businessman jailed in Tehran since December 1985on espionage charges. Cooper has not been tried.   Lord Tordoff of the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Partyquoted Larijani as saying: ``We are willing to use our good offices(to free the British captives). It takes a lot of patience.''   Iran's official news agency quoted Moayyeri as saying Tuesdaynight that Iran ``will ask its friends in Lebanon to help locate''the Britons.   Townsend said his group could not deliver a request by a supportgroup for Anderson that a U.S. delegation to be allowed intoTehran. He said the proposal ``would have been totallycounterproductive'' and ``frankly daft ... at the present time''because the Iranians ``have an obsession about the United States.''   They ``see the United States in a very different category toWestern Europe, so I'm afraid the Iranian lever for Americanhostages in the Lebanon is not one one can easily pull,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
