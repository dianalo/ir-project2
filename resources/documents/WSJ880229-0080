Already, the &quot;selling of America&quot; has become a hot topic among politicians and the press. And the sale has barely begun. The economic policies of the last seven years ensure that the foreign appetite for American investments will continue to grow in the coming decade.    The end result will be a dramatic reversal of the U.S. role in the world economy. For more than 30 years after World War II, U.S. multinationals spread their capital around the globe. Now, the nation finds itself on the receiving end. &quot;The American Challenge&quot; to the world, as Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber described it two decades ago, has become the world's challenge to America.    The reason for this transformation is simple. Six years of unprecedented U.S. trade deficits have left foreigners with a wealth of American dollars, and limited interest in American goods. Initially, those investors parked their excess dollars in U.S. bank accounts and Treasury bills. But increasingly, they're finding their interests are better served by putting their dollars directly into U.S. property and business.    Direct investment can often offer the foreign investor a better return than the interest paid on bank accounts and Treasury bills. In addition, says Robert Lipsey, professor of economics at Queens College of the City University of New York, direct investments are less susceptible to the vagaries of fluctuating exchange rates. When the dollar falls, the Japanese investor holding Treasury bills suffers an immediate loss. But the German owner of, say, a U.S. firm may find that the value of his investment rises as the company's export prospects improve.    Even the most optimistic economic analysts see U.S. trade deficits continuing for at least the next decade. Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass., projects trade deficits through the end of the century. That means foreigners would continue to have surplus dollars to invest in America.    The trend startles many Americans, who grew up in a nation that dominated global investment flows. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the giant U.S. multinationals invested $4 or $5 abroad for every $1 that foreigners invested here.    The American lead narrowed somewhat in the 1970s, as oil-rich nations used their petrodollars to buy up prime U.S. properties, such as Kiawah Island in South Carolina. Even this surge of foreign investment, however, was small in comparison to the new wave.    As recently as 1979, foreign direct investment in the U.S. was only half the size of U.S. investment abroad, according to David Hartman of Data Resources. But by 1986, foreign investors had nearly caught up with their U.S. counterparts, investing $25 billion here compared to $28 billion in new U.S. investments abroad.    Last year, foreign investors apparently pulled ahead. In the coming years, their lead will surely widen.    To some, this development suggests U.S. economic power is in eclipse. That may be true. But legislators are wrong in calling for measures to monitor and restrict foreign investment. And authors Martin and Susan Tolchin, whose new book &quot;Buying Into America&quot; is fueling foreign investment fear here, seem misguided in suggesting stricter controls are needed.    Foreign ownership of U.S. real estate and business, although rising, still remains remarkably small. Foreigners control less than 5% of the nation's assets. And the Japanese, who seem to raise the most concern, control less than 1%. Even if foreign holdings in this country double, they will still scarcely threaten U.S. sovereignty, as the Tolchins suggest.    In addition, foreign investment is more a symptom of our current economic ills than a cause. Any effort to curb the flow of capital from abroad would cause more harm than good.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan stressed that point in testimony to Congress last week. Foreign money that sits in bank accounts and Treasury bills, he noted, can be withdrawn quickly if overseas investors lose confidence in the U.S. economy, causing a sharp drop in the dollar, a rise in U.S. interest rates, or both. Money invested in a chemical plant in Louisiana, on the other hand, can't be withdrawn without difficulty. That means more stability for the U.S. economy.    In addition, U.S. companies benefit from the skills and knowledge of foreign investors, just as foreign companies benefited in the 1950s and 1960s from U.S. multinationals. Harvard economist Lawrence Summers points out that there is much &quot;we can learn about the technology of producing goods and the methods of managing and motivating people&quot; from Japanese auto companies.    There may be reasons to fear some foreign investment. Protecting technology crucial to national security is often cited. But the benefits of allowing foreigners to invest freely in this country clearly outweigh the costs. After a generation spent convincing foreign nations to accept U.S. investment, the U.S. now needs to show it has learned its own lesson.    Ultimately, the best way to reduce the flow of foreign investment is to reduce the trade deficit. And the best way to reduce the trade deficit, as the president's Council of Economic Advisers argues in its latest report, is to reduce the budget deficit. That's the real challenge for those worried about the selling of America. </TEXT></DOC>
