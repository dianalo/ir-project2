Bell Atlantic Corp.'s earnings rose 6.1% in the second quarter, while Pacific Telesis Group's profit fell 3.8%, and BellSouth Corp.'s net income dropped 6.4%.    The three &quot;baby Bells,&quot; as regional phone companies are called, &quot;are highly regulated as far as rate of return, and most of them are at allowed-earnings levels,&quot; said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. &quot;So the ability for them to grow their earnings this year vs. last year is kind of tough.&quot; Local telephone services are regulated by state public utilities commissions, he noted.    &quot;Earnings in essence have stalled out,&quot; added Robert B. Morris III, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Capital Funding. &quot;The dramatic expansion in operating margins associated with cost-cutting programs of previous years has subsided,&quot; he said. &quot;You just aren't getting the margin expansion you were in earlier years.&quot;    Shares of all three companies fell in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Bell Atlantic slipped 37.5 cents, to close at $66.25. Pacific Telesis declined 50 cents, to $25.50. And Bell South slumped $1.125, closing at $38.375.    Bell Atlantic   Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas E. Bolger, attributed the 6.1% rise to &quot;increasing demand&quot; in both the company's regulated and unregulated businesses. Unregulated activities -- in which there is no state or federal interference -- include cellular mobile telephone and telephone equipment businesses. Bell Atlantic's revenue for the second quarter rose 6.8%, to $2.64 billion from the year-earlier $2.47 billion. Bell Atlantic is based in Philadelphia.    Pacific Telesis   At San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, Donald E. Guinn, chairman and chief executive, said the 3.8% earnings decline reflected &quot;the significant impact of the California Public Utilities Commission's order to reduce . . . 1987 rates.&quot; As previously reported, the commission is recommending rate reductions of as much as $225.1 million a year, retroactive to March 1986. Pacific Telesis said that if the entire recommended decrease had been adopted in the second quarter, earnings would have been reduced by $148 million.    Mr. Guinn noted, however, that revenue of $2.28 billion was about flat with the $2.26 billion of the year-earlier quarter, &quot;which was a particularly strong period for us.&quot;    Nevertheless, analysts said Pacific Telesis performed slightly worse than expected. Prudential-Bache's Mr. Morris noted, however, that &quot;part of that is they have been very conservative in reporting, and have effectively drawn costs from future quarters into this quarter.&quot;    BellSouth   Atlanta-based BellSouth attributed its 6.4% earnings decrease to costs from an early retirement program, and to increased depreciation rates. &quot;We believe the increased expenditures in both these areas will prove to be sound investments in BellSouth's future,&quot; said John L. Clendenin, chairman and chief executive officer. He said the two moves are intended to &quot;improve the quality of our earnings and . . . better control our future costs.&quot;    BellSouth said the early retirement program reduced net income about $26.7 million, or six cents a share. It said depreciation expenses climbed 22%, to $625.7 million from the 1986 second quarter. BellSouth's revenue increased 3.5%, to $3.03 billion from $2.93 billion.    ---                           1987            1986                       in       per     in       per    %                     millions  share  millions  share  chg.
