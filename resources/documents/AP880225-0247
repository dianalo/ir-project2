Britain, the staunchest opponent of sanctions against SouthAfrica, faced renewed demands from the opposition Labor Party andthe Anti-Apartheid Movement organization that Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher approve tough embargoes against South Africa.   Neil Kinnock, Labor Party leader, said the Thatcher government``bears a heavy responsibility,'' for the South African governmentban on political activity by 18 major black movements opposed toapartheid, including the United Democratic Front.   ``Because it has been so weak against apartheid, we now haveeven more vicious jackboot rule,'' Kinnock said.   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said he was ``shocked andsaddened'' by the crackdown.   ``We do not see how the suppression of non-violent politicalactivity can possibly contribute to a peaceful solution to SouthAfrica's problems,'' Howe said in a statement, describing the banas ``oppressive.''   ``We are particularly concerned that the black opposition inSouth Africa should not lose hope of peaceful fundamental change.Frustration and despair breed violence,'' Howe added.   Sir Shridath Ramphal, secretary-general of the Commonwealth,called on the international community, particularly Westerncountries opposed to sanctions, to show South Africa ``in everypossible way ... that this repression is as intolerable asapartheid.''   Mrs. Thatcher regularly has been isolated at summits of theCommonwealth, the 48-nation association of Britain and its formercolonies, for her refusal to impose tough embargoes against SouthAfrica, a major trading partner.   The Anti-Apartheid Movement planned demonstrations at the SouthAfrican Embassy and said it would join other groups in an``international demonstration.''   Anti-Apartheid Movement president, Anglican Archbishop TrevorHuddleston, said South Africa ``is once again prohibitingnon-violent resistance to apartheid and has slammed the door on anyprospect of genuine negotiation.''   ``Britain and South Africa's other major trading partners mustact decisively,'' Huddleston added, saying he would appeal again toMrs. Thatcher to change her stance on sanctions.   Mrs. Thatcher argues that harsh sanctions against South Africawill harden white resistance to change, harm blacks most, and beevaded by third party countries which are not now big tradingpartners.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
