It will share discussion time with Mr. Gorbachev's proposed &quot;radical cuts in long-range strategic arms&quot; (&quot;subject,&quot; he added pointedly, &quot;to preserving the ABM treaty&quot;). Debating the merits and disadvantages of this deal will now consume the best hours of the West's best strategic minds. Opinion polls will be commissioned. Western defense policy, notably the conventional defense of Europe, will be rethought, redebated and resubmitted for reconsideration to defense ministries, parliaments and Congress. The American President will spend his final year arguing about arms control with conservatives.    In short, the West will debate with itself, and the Soviets will go home to work -- developing and building a coherent military machine.    At some point, after all the commemorative journalism has subsided in the nation's capital, someone other than just the hard-liners will have to ask some hard questions about where the current arms-control process is taking the West.    Have Western elites concluded that their people more highly value psychological security (presumably affirmed in the opinion polls) than security based on the hardware of serious defense? In particular, will someone look at the treaty's text to find out whether the missiles' warheads will be destroyed, or whether in fact they will be stored and refitted on newer missiles. Is it true that the explosive charges of the &quot;eliminated&quot; missiles may be saved and used on new missiles? If so, will someone please tell all the Pentagon reporters and strategic pundits to either define their words so the public can understand them or stop talking about eliminated warheads.    On reading the treaty, will someone also tell us if it's true that it eliminates not only nuclear but conventional ground-launched cruise missiles? We hear that because of verification the latter has to go with the former. This means that what's really ended by the treaty is the best hope for a conventional defense of Europe.    Soviet offensive strategy depends crucially on attacking in sequenced, massed echelons from Eastern Europe and inside the Soviet Union. Cruise missiles are extremely accurate and can carry large payloads needed for powerful conventional warheads; if properly developed, the conventional GLCM would be capable of slowing an echeloned Soviet attack by quickly hitting bridges, massed armor and communications outposts. Whether eliminating the potential for useful weapons in which the U.S. excels makes the world safe or less safe is a question that won't appear in an opinion poll.    The Soviets, it's said, have accepted &quot;intrusive&quot; verification procedures. American inspectors will keep watch on the doors of a factory in Votkinsk that produces both intermediate-range SS-20 and intercontinental SS-25 missiles; their mission will be to ensure that the factory produces only missiles that can reach the U.S.    If over the treaty's 13-year inspection regime one of the American observers raises an objection, the U.S. and the Soviets will talk about that in something called the Standing Nuclear Commission. This succeeds the Standing Consultative Commission, where we talked about (and never once did anything about) Soviet violations of the two SALT treaties. Neither commission can compel either party to cease an activity; they are forums for discussion.    The U.S. Senate already has made its own contribution to the arms-control process this year. It spent most of its session debating two matters. First, whether the binding version of the ABM treaty was the &quot;broad&quot; interpretation negotiated with the Russians or the &quot;restrictive&quot; version sold to the Senate. Debate Topic Two, which held up the defense authorization bill, was an amendment requiring the administration to adhere to the terms of the SALT II treaty, which the Senate refused to ratify in 1979.    The hoopla surrounding the signing of this latest treaty conceals a hard fact: The entire Washington community, from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other, of late has suffered a fundamental loss of seriousness about the direction and purpose of Western security. We suspect that many in Washington, Democrats and Republicans, know this to be so. Will any of them soon begin redefining an agenda that forces the West to work on its defense, instead of mostly talking about it?    Arms control, we fear, has become the heavy-metal music of Western foreign policy -- a seemingly addictive pursuit of otherwise normal people. There seems to be a difference, though, at least so far. After a heavy-metal concert, the audience goes back to the real world. </TEXT></DOC>
