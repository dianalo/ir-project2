(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense lawyers portray a former New YorkFederal Reserve Bank director who admitted leaking secret data as agenerous ``country banker'' seduced into the crime by a friend.   A memorandum submitted Wednesday to the judge preparing tosentence Robert A. Rough described the ex-banker as a man shatteredby betraying his trust.   His attorneys asked for probation and a sentence of 200 hours ofcommunity service at Newton Memorial Hospital, where the 50-year-oldman would be willing to perform the ``most demeaning manual tasks.''   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise could impose up tofive years in prison at sentencing Sept. 13. The government hasrecommended no more than one year.   Rough, while president of the National Bank of Sussex County, saton the board of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 1982 to 1984.   In a plea agreement with the government last June, he admittedregularly disclosing advance word on New York Fed recommendations tothe Federal Reserve Bank in Washington regarding the discount rate.Several times he revealed actual Fed decisions on the rate.   Federal authorities called the case the first to involve insidertrading of government securities, and the first such charges againsta director in the Fed system.   The discount rate, which is the interest the Fed charges on loansto member banks, can have a powerful effect on the securities market.   Rough gave the information to principals of the now-defunctbrokerage firm Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Inc., and the governmentclaims they used it to reap millions in profits and avoid losses.Five top executives, including company president Gilbert C.Schulman, who was Rough's neighbor and friend, were implicated inthe firm's 1985 collapse and sent to prison.   Schulman was described in the defense attorneys' memo as a``nefarious individual well-known to this court ... the consummateflim-flam artist.''   The memo said Schulman saw Rough's position on the New York Fed'sboard as a chance to profit.   ``Accordingly, Schulman constantly prodded, poked, cajoled andpleaded with Rough'' to reveal discount-rate data, the memo said.   In his own statement to Debevoise, Rough blamed his actions on``misguided notions of friendship;'' the ``rationalization'' thatthe discount rate was a market follower; and the fact that 11 otherregional banks made recommendations.   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman, who handled the case,argued, ``Nobody twisted his arm. It was Rough's decision to revealthe information.''   Weissman, in his memo, had called Rough's actions ``seriouscriminal behavior'' by someone who ``grossly abused'' his position.   The government charged that Rough was given $47,000 ininterest-deferred loans in exchange for the information, but addedin its memo that Rough probably didn't see the loans as a payback,only as unrelated personal loans from Schulman.   Along with Rough's apologies to Fed officials and admission thathe abused his trust, Rough's memo detaile how he ``has seen hisentire world crumble before his eyes.''   From successful ``country banker'' _ the third generation of hisfamily in banking _ who counseled the community, chairman of the NewJersey Bankers Association and local Fed director, Rough has losthis profession and is ``virtually penniless,'' said the memo. Asupportor's letter cited $250,000 in legal fees.   His wife has filed for divorce and his two sons, age 18 and 20,are unemployed and frequently in trouble with the law, it said.   ``My career is finished in disgrace; I have tainted the Fed whichI so revered; I have brought shame to my family; and finally my lifeis in personal and financial ruins,'' he wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
