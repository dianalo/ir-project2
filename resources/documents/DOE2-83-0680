The system has been developed for ENCASUR (PuertollanoMine) and includes a subsystem for storage and semi-automatic interpretationof the data on a personal computer. Digitizing and on tape storage ofthe logs is performed simultaneously with plotting on paper, and severalparameters related to initial depth, log id., log type, and amplifyingfactors can be input during the process. The log interpretation processis interactive, and it is based on a graphical representation of thelog on the computer screen, allowing for recalculations under variousconditions. The computer program calculates the coal seam characteristics,making all the necessary corrections, leaving to the operator the responsibilityof determining the edges of the seam and its identification. The systemhas drastically reduced the interpretation process down to about tenminutes from up to three hours. The computer program also stores theinterpreted data onto a file for later retrieval and use by other applicationprograms, such as spreadsheets or ore reserve estimation programs. 5figs.</TEXT></DOC>
