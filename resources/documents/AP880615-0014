Today, as Brazil struggles to become a modern developed nation,the Northeast holds it back _ not wholly of its own accord.   The nine northeastern states cover 1 million square miles ofland where Brazil bulges out into the Atlantic. In the area, 2{times the size of Texas, live 45 million of the nation's 143million people.   But while the prosperous South, with its airplane and computerfactories, has made Brazil the world's eighth-largest economy, thenortheast remains poor, neglected, diseased and assailed bydevastating cyclical droughts.   Statistics paint a gloomy picture of the northeast:   _ Infant mortality is higher than in sub-Saharan Africa at 124deaths per 1,000 births, compared to 67 per 1,000 in the South.   _ Life expectancy is 51 years, compared with 67 in the South.   _ A full 50 percent of northeasterners cannot write their ownnames; 26 percent can't elsewhere in Brazil.   _ Diseases long-eradicated elsewhere _ leprosy, chagas disease,polio, tuberculosis, even the plague _ still kill and deform in thenortheast.   ``We're creating a race of undersized subhumans who think onlyof survival,'' said Carlos Hollanda Labor, health secretary for thenortheast's Ceara state.   In the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy recognized theparched region, considered one of the world's poorest, as apossible source of social unrest. Shortly after Fidel Castro'srevolution in Cuba, Kennedy launched the U.S. Alliance forProgress, which promised billions of dollars and poured millionsinto development of Brazil's northeast _ until a 1964 Brazilianright-wing military coup eased fears of a communist or left-winguprising.   Droughts were a tragic part of the northeastern landscape evenbefore Portuguese conquerers recorded the first one more than 400years ago.   A drought that lasted from 1979 to 1984 killed an estimated250,000 peasant farmers and chased millions more to big city slumsin search of food, water and jobs.   This year, an expected rainfall of 31 inches will provide arespite for the characteristically small-statured northeasterners,but it is not likely to alter their struggle to survive.   ``The essential problem here is not whether it rains or not,''said Ari Guimaraes, head of the political science department of theUniversity of Bahia, another northeastern state. ``The problem isthat the government hasn't built reservoirs, explored undergroundwater supplies, irrigated peasant properties or distributed landamong those who have no means to survive.''   From the 1500s well into the 19th century, the northeast was aproductive area, but the wealth stayed with a few.   Agriculture led the economic activity, and the vast open spaceslent themselves to production of Brazil's most precious commoditiesat the time: cattle, cotton, sugar, tobacco and much later, coffee.   The Portuguese crown handed out large stretches of land tonobles and deserving soldiers. But far from central governmentcontrol in the South, northeast landowners set ``wild-west'' lawsfor peasant ``subjects'' and used private armies to chaseindividual farmers from modest-sized lands.   Such scenes have been pointedly described by Brazil's leadingnovelist, Jorge Amado, in ``Gabriela Clove and Cinnamon,''``Bahia'' and most recently ``Showdown.''   Successive governments have made promises to wrench the inlandpopulation from medieval-like poverty, but gun battles over landand vast misuse of government funds in the region are still common.   The military government that governed from 1964 through 1985built dams for hydroelectric power, roads, soccer stadiums andstretched electricty lines across the dry, cracked land. One toughmilitary president, the late Gen. Emilio Medici, who is said tohave condoned the torture of political opponents, was on the vergeof tears when he saw the northeast's poverty first hand.   But the grandiose projects of the military government did littleto ease the average northeasterner's lack of food, jobs, water andland.   A common belief among Northesterns is that the few directinvestments in their social concerns, such as food and waterdistributions during droughts and emergency work-relief jobs, wereturned to political advantage by local land-owning politicians whopass along favors to those who vote for them.   ``It is in the interests of the landowners to maintain theregion in utter poverty,'' claimed Maria Luiza Fontenelle, mayor ofFortaleza, capital of Ceara and the northeast's largest city, witha population of 1.6 million.   ``When people are poor they depend upon favors to survive.''   According to Bishop Jose Rodrigues of the Roman Catholic Churchin the hinterlands of Bahia, mayors control local unions and decidewho gets access to government health care, jobs and other benefits.   When the military stepped down and civilian government returnedto Brazil in 1985, hopes for widespread social reforms ran high.But many northeasterners say civilian rule for them has been ahollow triumph.   Last year, the region sold $4.4 billion worth of fruit, nuts,cocoa, sugar, tobacco and petroleum to southern Brazil and foreigncountries but received only $1 billion in government investments.   Promises of a land reform, irrigation of 2.5 million acres ofland and 2 million jobs were slashed as the government of PresidentJose Sarney sought to to cut a massive budget deficit, controlrunaway inflation projected at 600 percent annually and meetpayments on a $121 billion foreign debt.   Most significantly, Brazil's proposed new constitution makesvirtually impossible a long-promised land reform to distribute the46 percent of rural properties owned by just 1.2 percent of thepopulation. The Catholic church has accused the government ofbowing to powerful landowners on the issue.   But political scientists say the northeast's problems are fastbecoming problems for the rest of the country, most particularlythe more affluent South.   northeasterners, for example, now occupied whole shanty towns inthe major cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, pressing alreadyprecarious social and health services and pushing up crime rates.   ``Brazil will never be a stable democracy ... nor a developedcountry without resolving its vast inequalities,'' said onepolitical scientist, Helio Jaguaribe.   But the political balance also may be shifting.   In the 1986 gubernatorial elections, northeasterners chose fourgovernors who are considered politically progressive and morelikely to contest landowner power.   Mayor Fontenelle of Fortaleza, for example, is a member of theRadical Worker's Party.   At the same time, the Roman Catholic Church presses on its ownfor change.   Bishop Rodrigues has helped rural workers in seven of his 11doceses take control of local labor unions, often resulting in gunand stick battles between private armies of conservative mayors andlocal farmers.   In Jucas, a town of 8,000 people 300 miles west of Fortaleza,the Rev. Hans Stecker, a German priest who arrived 28 years ago,wages a relentless battle with Mayor Jose Fagundes, also the town'slargest landowner.   The priest has built a hospital, 39 schools and pre-schools andstarted health and education programs. Stecker said that inresponse to his projects the three-term mayor cut church'stelephone lines and prohibited the teaching of religion in townschools.   ``In some towns,'' said political scientist Guimaraes, ``thelocal priest can't leave home without a gun.''</TEXT></DOC>
