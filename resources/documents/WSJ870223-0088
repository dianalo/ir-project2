The two men and two women captured at a farm south of Paris included the leaders of Direct Action, a far-left group that has claimed responsibility for nearly 80 bombings and other terrorist attacks since 1979. Direct Action claims it was behind the murder last November of Georges Besse, chairman of France's largest auto maker, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, as well as the 1985 killing of Gen. Rene Audran, who supervised arms sales at the Defense Ministry.    Police found extensive documents at the farm, including some that were in the briefcase of Mr. Besse. As Direct Action had contacts with Palestinian guerrillas and such European terrorists as West Germany's Red Army Faction and Belgium's Fighting Communist Cells, the documents could help track down terrorists operating outside France.    &quot;It's extremely important,&quot; said a diplomat who follows terrorism matters. &quot;You can't say it's the end of Direct Action, but it is the top two or three people. It is a major blow. I wouldn't underestimate its importance at all.&quot;    As for Mr. Chirac, the capture represents good news at a time when polls show the French public is increasingly pessimistic about his government and critical of him personally. Mr. Chirac's supporters hope this latest development, together with their efforts to build support for the prime minister, will help refurbish his tarnished image as a dynamic, effective leader.    Even President Francois Mitterrand, Mr. Chirac's political rival, sent the prime minister a congratulatory telegram calling the capture &quot;a remarkable success.&quot;    Still, few among Mr. Chirac's aides believe that the arrests will be a panacea for Mr. Chirac.    &quot;He's like someone in a mine field who has defused one mine,&quot; said Philippe Moreau Defarges, a professor at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris. &quot;In the coming days, the arrests will be seen as a big success for the government. But it isn't impossible that there will be more terrorist attacks in Paris next week. If there is . . . the advantage gained from the arrests will be wiped out.&quot;    For their part, business executives said they can't afford to let their guards down.    &quot;For people who live protected by bodyguards, it is one less risk,&quot; said an official at Renault. &quot;But in West Germany, the arrest of Andreas Baader didn't mean that the Red Army Faction stopped its attacks.&quot;    One reason the government is concerned about the prospect of more terrorism in France is the trial opening here today of Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, whose detention has been linked to a series of Paris bomb attacks last summer that killed 13 people and injured more than 250 others. French officials said they have received credible threats of new attacks, and have brought in hundreds of extra police to patrol subways, streets and other public places.    Mr. Abdallah, one of the most sought-after alleged Middle Eastern terrorists to be brought to trial, is the presumed chief of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction, which has specialized in attacks on American and Israeli diplomats. At the trial, he will be accused of complicity in the 1982 Paris killings of U.S. military attache Charles Ray and Israeli diplomat Yacov Barsimentov, as well as in the attempted murder of the U.S. consul in Strasbourg. Police said he had occasional contacts with Direct Action, which may have helped him operate within France.    In addition to documents that were found in Mr. Besse's briefcase, police said they found the names of other potential targets, as well as indications that the group planned to kidnap someone and hold him in exchange for Regis Schleicher, a Direct Action leader currently on trial for murdering two policemen. Police said a room at the farmhouse seemed to have been prepared to hold a hostage. </TEXT></DOC>
