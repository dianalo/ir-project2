Economists say the move will temporarily slow the inflationary momentum building up in the economy while having little immediate bearing on the course of the pound. Several economists say a rise to 11% is in the cards, but probably not until later in the year.    Reaction to the rate boost was muted, since the Bank of England's move to trigger higher base rates was widely anticipated. The increase is the fifth since the beginning of June, and it takes base rates to their August 1987 levels.    Base rates were last boosted Tuesday, with the half-point rise to 9.5%.    Economists say the latest move is almost certain to increase mortgage rates. The last major shift in mortgage rates was April 1, when rates fell around one-half percentage point. Building societies, which do most of Britain's mortgage lending, haven't been in a hurry to raise rates, since they have been flush with funds since the October stock-market crash.    A spokesman for Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest building society, said Halifax expects to raise mortgage rates from 9.8% to between 10.75% and 11.25% within the next two weeks. The increase would be effective from Aug. 1.    Leo Doyle, an economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said, &quot;The rate (increase) may take the edge off inflation but it won't guarantee an inflation rate of under 5% for next year.&quot; He predicted base rates will be 11% by the end of the year. Inflation, as measured by the retail-price index, was running at 4.2% in May.    The rate boost &quot;goes a long way in taking some of the inflationary momentum out of the economy, but it may not be enough,&quot; said Peter Spencer, senior economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. He expects 11% base rates by the fall.    Mr. Spencer predicts the pound will remain steady over the next month or so, trading between 3.05 and 3.12 marks.    He says he thinks the government may sit tight for at least another month and see what effect higher mortgages have on the housing market before considering higher base rates. Economists say that in addition to mortgage rates likely becoming higher, certain mortgage-tax-relief measures are expected to be abolished.    In the meantime, analysts say the Bank of Japan may continue to resist the dollar-fighting interest-rate increases adopted by West German and British policymakers. One major reason is an anticipated slowdown in economic growth in the quarter ended Thursday, analysts say. The central bank may be more concerned that if it tightens it could nudge a moderation of the pace of expansion toward a recession. </TEXT></DOC>
