(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A problem with a fuel tankpressurization system forced the Air Force on Sunday to postponethe launch of a military navigation satellite.   The countdown had progressed to just four minutes before liftoffwhen trouble was detected. The launch team had only a 21-minute``window'' in which to get the Delta 2 rocket off, not long enoughto work on the problem.   Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman, said the culprit wasa faulty helium pressure regulator. Helium is used to pressurizethe rocket's fuel tanks.   The launch was tentatively rescheduled for Monday at 12:54 p.m.   The Delta 2 is to carry up a $65 million Navstar satellite thatis to join a network of four other spacecraft that tell U.S. andallied military forces where they are within 50 feet anywhere inthe world.</TEXT></DOC>
