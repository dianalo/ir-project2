And in some sense that's just what's been happening.    Prices of these stocks, which are owned primarily by individuals rather than institutions, had been lagging the broad stock market since the middle of last year. Heavy tax-motivated selling in December widened the gap still further.    Thus, as 1986 ended, small stocks were seriously depressed, at least relative to other stocks. &quot;Only 20% to 25% of the OTC issues were selling&quot; for more than their average prices over the previous 200 trading days -- &quot;a sure sign the market was badly oversold and a rally was due,&quot; says San Francisco-based money manager Rajiv Sharma.    What a difference two weeks has made. The OTC market in general has outpaced the New York Stock Exchange composite index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the beginning of January. Moreover, gains for the smallest issues traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system have done even better.    Price increases in some of the hottest areas, such as computer and software stocks with market capitalization in the $15 million to $47 million range, have jumped more than 15% in the past two weeks. Dozens of individual stocks have leaped 30% and more.    Early indications are that individuals who cashed in OTC stocks for tax reasons last month are reinvesting. With the preferential 20% tax rate for capital gains eliminated Jan. 1, securities analysts had debated whether investors would continue to shoulder the price volatility and liquidity risks associated with small stocks in an effort to achieve the quick gains that have been their traditional lure.    They apparently needn't have worried, at least for now. Brokers say they have been doing a brisk business since the start of the new year. &quot;I had an investor ask me to reimburse him $200 that he didn't make because he couldn't get through on our phone lines to place his order,&quot; says Roger West, president of Broker Securities Inc., a Norfolk, Va.-based discount broker that specializes in OTC stocks.    Notwithstanding this year's special circumstances, a January surge in OTC stock buying isn't unusual. In fact, January price gains historically account for one-third to one-half of the annual price appreciation in the OTC market. These surges have resulted from reinvestment of the proceeds of December sales that were motivated by a desire to offset capital gains with capital losses.    Still, information on these small-capitalization issues isn't widely available. Analysts for the large brokerage houses and data banks have expanded into tracking the larger OTC stocks in recent years. But most still don't follow stocks with market capitalization of $50 million or less.    These issues -- currently racing ahead of the rest of the market -- account for about half of the 4,300 stocks listed on Nasdaq. But they have generally been considered too small for institutional investors.    Those who buy them are often insiders -- or people or local institutions familiar with the companies. </TEXT></DOC>
