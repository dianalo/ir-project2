At this moment Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is staking his political future on getting an unpopular tax-reform package that includes a new 3% general consumption tax through a special session of the Japanese Diet, or parliament, called just for that purpose.    What is new here is not a ruling Liberal Democratic Party intent on pushing through something over the wishes of the entire populace; what is new is the degree of opposition this has provoked, to the point where the postwar hegemony of the LDP is now showing its first cracks. Last year, for example, thousands of normally non-confrontational Japanese took to the streets in protest against a similar tax measure that includes a 5% sales tax. That plan was nixed when the LDP lost to a socialist in the LDP stronghold of Iwate, also ending the career of then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. On Sunday the Takeshita government faces a similar trial in another conservative stronghold, Fukushima, where socialists have a shot at a Diet seat and where the gubernatorial race has become a bitter contest between two LDP members, one of whom has sided with the socialists in opposition to the tax proposal. For although the government is touting the reform as a &quot;5.6 trillion yen (about $41,500,000,000) cut,&quot; the public sees it as but a ploy to introduce a consumption tax.    &quot;The decrease (in taxes) is there and apparent,&quot; says the chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Rokuro Ishikawa, a silver-haired man whose conservative attire is offset by a dashing French tie. &quot;But what the government is proposing is not what people had hoped for -- taxes on income are still too high.&quot;    Like Mr. Ishikawa, virtually everyone in Japan acknowledges the need for reform of the tax system; like him, too, they don't think this is it. The problem is twofold. First, over the years the system has become riddled with distortions and exemptions. More important, the system discriminates against salaried workers, who have taxes withheld. Japanese refer to this discrimination as the kuroyon, or 9:6:4, shorthand for the belief that salaried people pay tax on 90% of income, self-employed on 60% and farmers on 40%.    The government package is designed to redress this, not by a supply-side reduction in the overall tax burden but through a rejiggering of where it falls. On the income side, it is characterized by a few refined bows in the right direction. The number of tax brackets will be reduced from 12 to five, the top rate will drop from 60% to 50%, and a number of exemptions will be mopped up. This follows a modest start last September, when the top rate came down from 70% to 60%. Yet the government's problem is that everyone's attention is on the other side of the equation, the proposed 3% tax on consumption.    &quot;There have been many misunderstandings about this reform, says the young deputy director of the tax bureau at the Ministry of Finance, Yoshi Kimura. &quot;One is that this tax reform is to raise revenue, but it's a 2.4 trillion yen tax cut. What we're trying to do is shift the weight of taxation between direct and indirect taxation and to increase horizontal equity. The basic thrust is to make it more fair.&quot;    The government argues that it needs to shift from direct to indirect taxation, and that it needs the new consumption tax if it is to meet the future pension requirements of a graying Japan. But the Japanese are not buying it. The first argument would be more convincing if there were a significant cut in income taxes; the second if tax revenue were not showing a large surplus these days.    Although the LDP has a comfortable parliamentary majority, tradition precludes ramming measures through in the face of a united opposition, and the effort to introduce a consumption tax has failed thrice before. The feeling is that if anyone can put in the fix to get this through it's Mr. Takeshita, Nippon's answer to Lyndon B. Johnson, and he has laid the groundwork with some compromises appealing to various Japanese interest groups. Indeed, it is an indication of just how little public opinion counts for in Japan that he will probably succeed and be regarded as a hero in his party for doing it.    &quot;The government is promising not to raise taxes, but the government has been lying since the Meiji period,&quot; says the president of Life Stores Co., Shinji Shimizu.    Nor should the modest cuts in the top income rates be taken as evidence that Japan has recognized that it's possible to expand the tax base by lowering the tax rate. You won't find any Laffer Curves here in the Ministry of Finance. A three-hour search among the reams of statistics piled up in the ministry's cavernous rooms, for example, reveals that the government does not even keep revenue figures by tax bracket. So there is no way of knowing whether last year's marginal tax cuts resulted in a loss in tax revenue or not, and officials don't seem interested.    &quot;That hasn't been part of our thoughts or calculations,&quot; says the ministry's Mr. Kimura, who has a master's from Harvard Law School. Other officials say there are few people in the top brackets anyway.    But perhaps that's because the system forces them to hide. In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher cut the top income-tax rate in 1979 and, lo, over the next five years the number of millionaires in Britain jumped from 4,000 to 20,000. In Japan, a wealth of evidence suggests that Japanese are as adept at loopholes as anyone. They take refuge in schemes that give tax breaks to religious-affiliated companies, certain savings plans and people who incorporate. Two recent films -- &quot;A Taxing Woman&quot; and &quot;A Taxing Woman II&quot; -- about a tax collector's efforts to ferret out clever evaders were box-office hits.    The point is that instead of seeing the kuroyon syndrome as an indication that the high rates themselves are the problem, the LDP dropped another net, the consumption tax. How much longer Japan can continue to ignore incentives and popular resentment is the real question, even if the government does win in Sunday's Fukushima elections and Mr. Takeshita gets his way. For the moment officialdom is banking on Japanese chauvinism, that Japanese will not go abroad, that they will work hard no matter how high they are taxed, and that they really don't need to worry about the foreigners who might be discouraged by the costs of preserving the system. That may have worked during the Tokugawa period, when Japan was shut off from the rest of the world. But in an increasingly internationalized economy, such parochialism is risky. The Japanese are different, but in the end they're not that different.    &quot;In the old days it was the army that stubbornly kept to old ideas and old ways,&quot; says the feisty Mr. Shimizu. &quot;Now it's the Ministry of Finance.&quot;    ---   Mr. McGurn is deputy editorial page editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
