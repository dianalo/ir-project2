In accordancewith past procedure, the Tribunal resolved that the 1986 distribution proceedingwould be conducted in two phases. In Phase I, the Tribunal would determinethe allocation of cable royalties among various program categories of claimants.The Phase I categories were: Program Suppliers (MPAA, Multimedia, NAB),Sports (Major League Baseball, NBA, NHL, NCAA), Noncommercial Television(PBS), U.S. Commercial Television (NAB), Music (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), DevotionalPrograms (CBN, PTL, OTGH), Canadian Programs (CBC, CTV), NoncommercialRadio (NPR) and Commercial Radio (NAB).\1\<NOTE/> In Phase II, the Tribunal would allocate cable royaltiesto individual claimants within a program category.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The parties mentioned in parenthesis are the major claimantsin each category. The listing is for the reader's edification, and is notintended to be a complete list.For this 1986 proceeding, there were no controversies in Phase I. All PhaseI parties settled based upon the allocations made by the Tribunal in the1983 cable distribution proceeding. (The 1984 and 1985 Phase I controversieswere similarly settled on the basis of the 1983 allocations.)In Phase II, there was one controversy. Within the Program Suppliers categories,three parties advanced claims which, when combined, exceeded 100% of thecategory. The three parties were: the Motion Picture Association of America,Inc., (MPAA), Multimedia Entertainment, Inc. (Multimedia), and the NationalAssociation of Broadcasters (NAB).MPAA claimed 99.3% of the Program Suppliers category, while proposing thatNAB be awarded 0.38%, and Multimedia be awarded 0.32%. Multimedia claimed0.975% of the Program Suppliers category, while proposing that MPAA beawarded 98.225%, and NAB be awarded 0.8%. NAB claimed 0.8% of the ProgramSuppliers, while proposing that MPAA be awarded 98.225% and Multimediabe awarded 0.975%.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Chronology</ITAG>Seven hundred and twenty-one (721) individual or joint claims were filedwith the Tribunal for the 1986 cable royalty fund. On December 15, 1987,the Tribunal published a notice directing all claimants to inform the Tribunalby February 4, 1988 whether any controversies existed concerning the distributionof the 1986 cable copyright royalty fees. 52 FR 47626.In response to requests filed by the claimants, the Tribunal twice extendedthe time to file comments concerning a controversy, first to March 4, 1988,then to April 15, 1988. <T3>Order, </T3>dated February 4, 1988; <T3>Order,</T3> dated March 8, 1988.Based upon written comments filed April 15, 1988, the Tribunal concludedthat controversies existed regarding the distribution of the 1986 cablecopyright royalty fees, both in Phase I and in Phase II of the proceeding,effective April 21, 1988. At the same time, the Tribunal ordered a partialdistribution of the 1986 cable fund. 53 FR 13144 (April 21, 1988).The filing of written direct cases in Phase I was originally scheduledfor August 5, 1988, but was delayed twice at the request of the partiesto facilitate settlement negotiations and for delays in the productionof evidence due to the U.S. Court of Appeals' decision in <T3>Cablevision </T3>versus <T3>MPAA, et al.</T3> <T3>Order</T3>, dated July 11, 1988; <T3>Order</T3>, dated September 30, 1988.On October 12, 1988, the Tribunal received a motion from all Phase I claimantgroups informing the Tribunal that they had reached an agreement regardingthe Phase I allocations for five of the claimants groups_U.S. CommercialTelevision, Music, the Devotional Programs, the Canadian Programs, andNoncommercial Radio_and asking the Tribunal to adopt the agreed-upon allocations.The allocations the parties agreed to were the same percentages allocationsas those for the 1983-1985 cable royalty funds.On December 2, 1988, the Tribunal was notified that Program Suppliers,Sports and Public Broadcasting Service had reached a settlement of theircontroversy, which was confirmed at the scheduled hearing, December 5,1988. Consequently, all controversies in Phase I were resolved. The Tribunaladopted the agreed-upon allocations, and ordered another partial distributionof the 1986 cable royalty fund. <T3>Order</T3>, dated December 5, 1988.On February 6, 1989, the Phase II claimants, MPAA, Multimedia and NAB,filed their written direct cases. The hearing of the direct cases tookplace on February 13, 14, 15, and 16, 1989.Phase II rebuttal cases were filed February 27, 1989, and hearing of therebuttal cases took place in March 2, 6, 7, and 8, 1989. The record inthe proceeding was closed March 17, 1989.The Program Suppliers claimants filed their Proposed Findings of Fact andConclusions of Law on March 24, 1989.

MPAA Ex. 1. Collectively, the 99 claimants seek the cable royaltiesattributable to 6,229 different syndicated series, movies and specialsbroadcast on 113 commercial television stations which were retransmittedby cable systems in 1986 and whose viewing was measured by a Nielsen studycommissioned by MPAA. MPAA Ex. 6.Multimedia is the producer and syndicator of the following programs: ``Donahue''_261hours of news/interview programs, including 210 original programs, and51 repeat programs; ``Sally Jessy Raphael''_261 half-hours of interview/talkprograms, including 236 original programs, and 25 repeat programs; ``NewMusic City U.S.A.''_52 half-hour country music programs, including 25 originalprograms, and 27 repeat programs; ``Young People's Specials''_10 half-hourchildren's features: ``Runaway to Glory,'' ``Nicky and the Nerd,'' ``Buddies,''``Umbrella Jack,'' ``That Funny Fat Kid,'' ``Molly's Pilgrim,'' ``The HorribleSecret,'' ``My First Swedish Bombshell,'' ``Little Arliss,'' and ``Charlie'sChristmas Secret'' (four of these were first-run programs in 1986); ``CountryMusic, Entertainment and International Specials''_ten primetime country,music, entertainment and international specials, including, $20th AnnualMusic City News Country Music Awards,'' ``6th Annual National Song WritersAwards,'' ``Family affair: Osmonds' 25th Anniversary,'' ``Statlers' ChristmasPresent,'' ``Public People, Private Lives,'' Marty Robbins: Super Legend,''``Dreesen Street (original and Repeat), ``New Stars of `86,'' ``Spacesbridge:A Citizens' Summit,'' and ``Citizens' Summit II: Women to Women'' (eightof these were first-run programs in 1986).

NAB categorizedits programs, generally, as coaches shows, specials and series with regionalappeal, sports programs, news/talk/public affairs programs, children'sprograms, documentary and instructional programs, parades, pageants andspecial events, and entertainment/talk shows. Test. of Richard Ducey, pp.6-15.<T3>MPAA's claim. </T3>As a part of its case for several distribution proceedings,MPAA has commissioned a special Nielsen study to prove its entitlement.47 FR 9880; 48 FR 9554; 51 FR 12794; 52 FR 8416; 53 FR 7133. The studymeasures the hours of distant signal nonnetwork programming which are viewedby cable households. <T3>Id.</T3>For this proceeding, MPAA selected to be included in the Nielsen studyall U.S. commercial television broadcast stations which reached a minimumaverage of 80,000 Form 3 cable subscribers, as determined from the statementof accounts filed by the cable systems as of November, 1987 for the twosemiannual accounting periods of 1986. Test. of Allen Cooper, p. 6. A totalof 113 commercial stations met MPAA's criteria: 70 network-affiliates and43 independent stations. MPAA Ex. 3.Once the sample broadcast stations are selected, the study is based ondata compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Company from Nielsen Station Index (NSI)diaries distributed to approximately 950,000 television households, includingboth cable subscribers (from Form 1, 2, and 3 systems) and non-subscribers,during six four-week measurement periods, or ``cycles.'' During 1986, thesecycles encompassed January 2-29, January 30-February 26, May 1-28, July10-August 6, September 25-October 22 and October 30-November 26. Test.of Allen Cooper. p. 5. For the four principal cycles, February, May, Julyand November, 436,000 diaries were returned, reviewed by the Nielsen Companyand accepted as accurate, and of those, 230, 839 or 52.94% were from cablehouseholds. Tr. 8.The scope of the 1986 Nielsen study is greater than the 1985 Nielsen study.MPAA lowered the threshold of those stations which would be included inthe study from stations reaching 100,000 subscribers to stations reaching80,000. Consequently, 113 commercial stations were measured as opposedto 104 commercial stations in 1985. According to MPAA, these 113 stationsaccounted for more than 95% of all distant cable viewing of U.S. commercialprograms by Form 3 cable systems, versus its estimate for 1985 that the104 commercial stations accounted for 86.5% Test. of Allen Cooper, pp.8-9; 1985 Test. of Allen Cooper, pp. 3-4.The cable household viewing hours found by the MPAA-commissioned Nielsenstudy attributable to the programs of each of the three Program Suppliersclaimants were:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L0,s25,14,10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1>(Percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">MPAA<D>2,618,283,918</D><D>99.289</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NAB <D>10,276,176</D><D>.390</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Multimedia<D>8,463,698</D><D>.321</D></ITAG></ITAG>Test. of Allen Cooper, p. 10; NAB Ex. 9RX; MPAA Ex. 12R.MPAA and NAB disputed the ownership of 11 programs, three of which hadreported cable household viewing hours of 188,231. MPAA Ex. 16R (revised).If NAB were given the credit for those three programs, instead of MPAA,the percentages for each of the three claimants would be: MPAA_99.282%NAB_0.397%, Multimedia_0.321%.In the 1984 distribution proceeding, the Nielsen viewing data for the threeparties were: MPAA_99.330%, NAB_0.404%, Multimedia_0.266%. 51 FR 8419.In the 1985 distribution proceeding, a proceeding in which NAB did notparticipate, the relative Nielsen data for MPAA and Multimedia were: MPAA_99.74%,Multimedia_0.26%. 53 FR 7133.When asked by counsel for Multimedia whether the Nielsen viewing data are``pin-point accurate'' or yield the ``actual number of cable households''that viewed the distant programming, MPAA witness Cooper said that anyNielsen statistic is based upon estimates, and the estimates are subjectto error. Tr. 707. Even for the range of probable error to be correct,it would need to assume a perfectly representative sample and that eachparticipant in the sample complied completely with the survey requirements,which, Cooper stated, never happens. Tr. 708. The value of the Nielsendata, Cooper stated, is that they are relied on by stations, programmersand advertisers, and understanding their limitations, ``they are fine forthe purposes of constructively making decisions.'' <T3>Id</T3>.In the 1985 proceeding, MPAA argued that the Tribunal should employ theNielsen study as the sole means of determining the allocation among claimantsin the Program Suppliers category, because it felt that it provided theonly objective standard of measuring the relative values of competing claims.1985 Test. of Allen Cooper, p. 8. This argument was rejected by the Tribunal.53 FR 7136. In this proceeding, MPAA argues that the Nielsen study shouldbe the Tribunal's primary consideration, and that the weight to be affordedthe evidence of the other claimants should be so slight as to result inan allocation virtually the same as that which would have obtained froma strict application of the Nielsen data. Test. of Allen Cooper, pp. 3-4,12.Responding to the Tribunal's statement in the 1985 proceeding that creditwould be given when it is shown that a claimant's programs have been eitherunmeasured or undermeasured by the Nielsen study, MPAA submitted a listof more than 820 titles (mostly movies and a few series) aired in over1800 broadcasts which, because the programs were broadcast either by anon-sample station or outside the measurement period, were not measuredat all in the Nielsen study. MPAA Ex. 8; Test. of Marsha Kessler, pp. 2-3.MPAA did not attempt to obtain a comprehensive list of all unmeasured MPAA-representedprograms. The listed programs were only those which happened to be sentby some program suppliers during the MPAA certification process. Tr. 123.A second list of 21 television series was also submitted by MPAA, whichalthough measured by the Nielsen study, was alleged to have been undermeasured.Both lists were analyzed by MPAA for total subscriber-incidents (that is,the number of broadcasts times the numbers of subscribers reached) outsideof the Nielsen measurement periods. MPAA Exs. 9, 10.<T3>NAB's claim.</T3> In support of its claim, NAB presented two exhibits.The first exhibit was a copy of a questionnaire on programs syndicatedin 1986 which the NAB-represented broadcast stations filled out at NAB'srequest. NAB Ex. II-1. The second exhibit was a listing of the syndicatedprograms which the broadcast stations claim. NAB Ex. II-2 (amended). Thelisting was based upon the response to the questionnaire. Test. of RichardDucey, p. 2. To assure the accuracy of the questionnaire data, NAB researchassistants re-contacted the stations by telephone to confirm and verifytheir responses. Tr. 363-64. Exhibit II-2 listed the titles of the syndicated programs, the stationwhich originated the program, the stations which carried the programs,and whether the program was a series or special. Ex. II-2 (amended). NABunderlined which carrying stations were imported as a distant signal byForm 3 cable systems in 1986. <T3>Id</T3>. Those stations which were not underlined were confirmed byNAB to have been imported as a distant signal by at least one Form 1 orForm 2 cable system in 1986. Tr. 362-63.In addition, NAB presented Richard Ducey, senior Vice President and headof the NAB Research and Planning Department to give testimony concerningthe marketplace value of the NAB-represented programs. Test. of RichardDucey. Ducey described 58 of the 139 programs claimed by NAB as sportsprograms, either actual live sports games, such as state and regional highschool or amateur basketball, football, hockey and track and field championships,wrestling matches, bowling tournaments, horse races, and auto races; orprograms about sports, such as college or professional coaches' shows.<T3>Id</T3>., pp. 6-15. In Ducey's opinion, sports programs are especiallyattractive to subscribers. Tr. 392.In addition, Ducey emphasized that most of the NAB programs have specialinterest to cable subscribers within the state or region in which theyare retransmitted on a distant signal basis. The type of shows, Ducey stated,which have this kind of appeal are coaches' shows and regional sports programs,news programs, state lotteries, state fairs, and beauty pageants and politicalprograms. Tr. 368-371, 395; Test. of Richard Ducey, pp. 6-15. Finally,Ducey cited one program ``INN Evening News,'' which had 117 affiliatedstations, as a program with national interest. Test. of Richard Ducey,p. 17; NAB Ex. II-2 (amended). Concerning all of NAB's represented programs,whether sports or non-sports, whether regional or national, Ducey describedthem as timely, fresh and first-run programs having more appeal than reruns.<T3>Id.;</T3> Tr. 387-89.MPAA contested NAB's claim to represent 11 programs, asserting that theyhad been syndicated by MPAA-represented syndicators. Reb. Test. of MarshaKessler, pp. 8-9. The programs in question were: ``The Boy King,'' claimedby All American Television, ``Inday News,'' claimed by LBS, ``Breast Cancer:My Body, My Life,'' claimed by Twentieth Century-Fox, and ``Public Women,Private Men,'' ``Drop Everything and Read,'' ``When I Was Your Age,'' ``NotesTo My Parents,'' ``The Crossing,'' ``No Secrets,'' ``Street Shadows,''and ``Origins,'' claimed by Group W Westinghouse. <T3>Id.</T3>Only three of the eleven programs were measured by the Nielsen study tohave measurable cable household viewing hours. MPAA Ex. 16R. Accordingto the settlement agreement among MPAA-represented program suppliers, thosesuppliers who sign with MPAA agree to be compensated solely on the basisof the Nielsen study, so that programs they own which receive zero viewinghours, or which were not measured in the Nielsen study will not receivecompensation from MPAA from the Tribunal allocation for MPAA-representedprogram suppliers. Tr. 572, 574, 602.MPAA witnesses conceded that MPAA's challenge to NAB's right to represent``Breast Cancer; My Body, My Life'' might not be correct, that TwentiethCentury-Fox's ``It's My Body, It's My Life'' is a different program thanCBS' ``Breast Cancer: My Body, My Life.'' Tr. 604-610, 778-779.Group W Westinghouse signed to be represented for its programs by bothNAB and MPAA. Reb. Test. of Marsha Kessler, p. 9.MPAA drew concessions from NAB's witness on the issue of diversity programming,by demonstrating that many programs of regional appeal, such as the HaydenFry Program and the Tom Osborne Show, two coaches shows retransmitted tocable systems in Iowa and Nebraska, respectively, are also available locallyfrom over-the-air broadcast stations. MPAA Ex. 16X; Tr. 430-435. NAB counteredwith examples where programs are not duplicated by local broadcasts, suchas the Montana program, ``Face the State,'' which is available to Kalispelland Williston residents only by means of distant signal importation. Tr.391.NAB. sought credit for asserted undermeasurement of its specials in theNielsen study. NAB Prop. Findings, par. 19. Not including the NAB-MPAAcontested specials, NAB represented 82 specials for 1986. NAB Ex. II-2(amended). These 82 specials were broadcast on a total of 395 televisionstations which were also transmitted by Form 3 cable systems. 116 of these395 television stations, or 29.36% were among the selected commercial stationsin the Nielsen study. (In the previous two sentences, many stations werecounted more than once, because they carried more than one NAB-representedspecial). <T3>Id.</T3> This compares to the overall selection rate of 113 commercialstations chosen from 437 stations which were retransmitted by Form 3 systems,or 25.9%. Reb. Test. of Richard Thrall, p. 5; Test. of Allen Cooper, p.3. 12 of the specials which were on the 116 stations were actually measuredby the Nielsen study because they were aired during the sweep period, butit was not made part of the record how many times those 12 specials weremeasured; MPAA Ex. 16R (revised). MPAA noted that NAB's presentation lackedthe frequency of the airings of NAB's programs, and the cable systems whichcarried them, and their subscribership. MPAA Reply Findings, p. 34; NABDirect Case.<T3>Multimedia's Claim.</T3> Multimedia seeks an increase in its awardfrom 0.825%, which it received in 1985, to 0.975%. Multimedia Prop. Findings,p. 38. Two-thirds of Multimedia's proposed increase is based on what Multimediaclaims as changed circumstances. One-third is based on Multimedia's assertionthat WTBS already compensates those syndicators who supply programs toit with higher license fees, so that those syndicators incur far less harmto them than do syndicators who do not supply WTBS, such as Multimedia.<T3>Id.,</T3> pp. 4-5.Changed circumstances_``Donahue'' was broadcast on 209 broadcast stationsin 1986, as compared to 206 in 1985, 98 of which were retransmitted byForm 3 cable systems on a distant signal basis. Multimedia Exs. 15, 3R.``Donahue'' garnered 7,315, 294 household viewing hours in the Nielsenstudy versus 5,872,269 in 1985, an increase of approximately 24.6%. MPAAEx. 7. ``Donahue'' received daytime broadcast ratings in 1986 of 8, 7,7, 7 for the four sweep periods, as compared to daytime ratings of 7, 6,6, 6 for the same periods in 1985. Multimedia Ex. 5. The daytime sharefor ``Donahue'' was 31, 31, 28, 31 for the four sweep periods in 1986,as compared with 28, 30, 27, 28 for the same sweep periods in 1985. <T3>Id.</T3>Multimedia performed an advertsing analysis comparing how much revenue``Donahue'' generates for its affiliates with the total of all nonnetwork,nonlocal news spot sales. Multimedia Ex. 4 (corrected). Multimedia chose21 selected markets, representing 13.93% of the U.S., and, projecting thosemarkets to the total of all U.S. markets, found that ``Donahue'' generated2.18% of all 1986 nonnetwork, nonlocal news spots sales, as compared to1.61% for 1985. <T3>Id. </T3>MPAA analyzed the selected 21 markets and found that ``Donahue''in those markets had an average share 27.5% higher than the average sharefor ``Donahue'' for all television markets. MPAA Ex. 14R. Since advertisingrevenues are tied to the share a program gets, use of higher share marketstends to distort the advertising study, according to MPAA. Tr. 736. MPAAperformed its own analysis using the same format and group of markets containedin Multimedia's 1985 study and reached an advertising figure of 1.46%.MPAA Ex. 12X; Tr. 287-88.``Sally Jessy Raphael''_After having its first year of syndication in 1985,Sally Jessy Raphael increased the number of station affiliates from 70to 84 in 1986, 46 of which were retransmitted by a cable system on a distantsignal basis. Test. of Richard Thrall, p. 9; Multimedia Ex. 3R; Tr. 301.``Sally Jessy Raphael'' garnered 839,489 cable household viewing hours,compared to 298,912 in 1985, an increase of 180.85%. MPAA Ex. 7. In 1986,``Sally Jessy Raphael's'' average NSI daytime total households and personsincreased 90%, ratings rose 17% and audience share increase 7%. Test. ofRichard Thrall, p. 3. However, during 1986, daytime total households for``Sally Jessy Raphael'' declined from 1,605,000 to 1,395,000 from Februaryto November, despite an increase in the number of stations. Similarly,daytime total persons for ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' declined from 1,856,000to 1,533,000 from February to November. Multimedia Ex. 6. Finally, Multimediaoffered an advertising study for ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' similar to theone performed for ``Donahue'' which yielded 0.38% of all advertising revenuesfor all nonnetwork, non-local news spots sales. Multimedia Ex. 8 (corrected).For all other Multimedia programming, Multimedia proposed no finding ofchanged circumstances, stating, for example, that its country music andentertainment special viewership ``held steady.'' Test. of Richard Thrall,p. 14. According to the Nielson study, cable household viewing for allother Multimedia programming rose from 217,256 to 308,915, or 42.19%. MPAAEx. 12R; MPAA Ex. 7.The time for all Multimedia country music and entertainment specials onall broadcasting stations during 1986 was 45.73 hours, versus 41.1 hoursin 1985. Multimedia Ex. 15. Overall, the total hours occupied by all Multimediaprogramming in a typical week amounted to 1,381.55, representing a 3% increaseover 1985. Tr. 241; Test. of Richard Thrall, p. 17. MPAA attempted to rebutMultimedia's time estimate on the ground that Multimedia's estimate relieson all its programs being broadcast the maximum number of times possiblethroughout the year. MPAA estimated a reduction in total Multimedia timeof approximately 100 hours per week based on the number of broadcasts reportedby Arbitron SPAs. MPAA Ex. 13R.Undermeasurement_In addition to asserting changed circumstances, Multimediarenewed its claim from last year that its special were undermeasured bythe Nielson study, and added this year that its regularly scheduled series,such as ``Donahue,'' and ``Sally Jessy Raphael,'' were also undermeasuredMultimedia Ex. 1R, 2R, 3R.The Nielson study measured 113 commercial stations out of 437 commercialstations which were retransmitted by Form 3 cable systems, or 25.9%.

Multimedia Ex. 2R.MPAA responded that Multimedia's denominator in the fraction was not therelevant denominator because it included all broadcast stations regardlessof whether they were retransmitted by Form 3 cable systems on a distantbasis. MPAA Prop. Findings, p., 12. MPAA eliminated nonrelevant broadcastsfor two of Multimedia's specials for which there was record evidence, sothat ``6th Annual Song Writers Award'' was measured 7.9% of the time itwas broadcast on stations retransmitted by Form 3 cable systems, ratherthan 5.1%, and ``20th Annual Music City News Country Music Awards was measured8.25% of the time, rather than 5.17%. <T3>Id. </T3>p. 13. MPAA did not perform any more analyses of this kindfor the other Multimedia specials, not did it provide an overall percentage.WTBS_Multimedia introduced statements submitted by TBS to the SEC and theFCC in which TBS states that because of WTBS's special position in thecable market, it typically pays program suppliers a licensing fee significantlyin excess of the market rate for programming aimed at the Atlanta marketalone.

Specific examples of significantincrease in the license fees paid for ``Three Stooges'' and ``The AndyGriffith Show'' were given. <T3>Id. </T3>TBS estimated that it pays $10 million per year more thanthe average production and new costs of an independent station in the 11-20television markets. <T3>Id., </T3>p. 14. It is Multimedia's position that these additional$10 million fees negate the harm program suppliers to WTBS are allegedto incur, and that those who do not syndicate to WTBS, such as Multimedia,should get a correspondingly higher share of the program suppliers royalties.Multimedia Prop. Findings, pp. 33-36. MPAA introduced a cross examination exhibit to show that the 297.85% increasefrom 1978 to 1986 in license fees for WTBS to air ``The Andy Griffith Show''was less than the increases independent stations incurred nationwide from1978 to 1986 (379.3%) and less than independent stations in the 11-20 televisionmarkets incurred (612.87%). MPAA Ex. 17RX. Additionally, Multimedia's witnessconceded that TBS' statement compared WTBS' costs for 1986 to a typicalstation's costs for 1983. Tr. 1075-76. When the relevant year's costs werecompared, 25% of the independent stations in 1986 had production and newscosts of at least $12 million, compared to WTBS' cost of $15.2 millionMPAA Ex. 17RX. MPAA argued that Multimedia's award should be reduced on the harm factor,rather than program suppliers to WTBS, because Multimedia has avoided theharm caused to its programs by distant signal importation by not sellingany of its programs to the superstations. MPAA Prop. Findings, p. 15; Tr.1095-96. MPAA submitted an exhibit analyzing ``Donahue,'' ``Sally JessyRaphael,'' ``20th Annual Music City News Country Music Awards,'' and ``6thAnnual Song Writers Awards'', showing that although these shows were carriedcumulatively by 250 broadcast which were retransmitted by cable systemson a distant signal basis, those cable systems accounted for only about$4 million of the $118.7 million which were deposited by cable systems.Reb. Test. of Marsha Kessler, p., 2; MPAA Exs. 1R-5R; Tr. 559. Multimedia also alleged that TBS, knowing that MPAA distributes its royaltyshares based strictly on the Nielsen study, can schedule its programs onWTBS during Nielsen sweep periods so it can garner extra income for cablecopyright royalties. Multimedia gave the example of the Goodwill Games,which, if scheduled during June, outside of a sweep period, would get nocable royalties, but scheduled as it was during July, would be gettingapproximately $2 million in cable royalties. Tr. 968-69. Upon request fromthe Tribunal, Multimedia submitted the schedule of all previous summerOlympic Games, which showed that the 1976 and 1980 summer Olympic, werescheduled in July. Multimedia submission, dated March 13, 1989. Conclusions of Law <T3>MPAA, Multimedia and NAB have shown entitlement to 98.5%, 0.825% and0.675% of the Program Suppliers Phase I allocation, respectively. </T3>Our starting off point in analyzing the three Phase II program suppliersclaimants is our award to these claimants from the last previously litigatedproceeding. Our awards to these claimants were: MPAA_98.475%, Multimedia_0.825%,NAB_0.7%. These previous awards were arrived at by the Tribunal primarilyon the basis of the special Nielsen study of cable household viewing ofdistant signals and other evidence going to the five factors employed bythe Tribunal in analyzing a claimant's claim: harm to the claimants, benefitto the cable operator, marketplace value, and to a lesser degree, qualityand time. In this proceeding, one alleged insufficiency of the Nielsen data, whetherthe Nielsen study undermeasured any of the three claimants overall programming,was especially contested. The other important issues were whether any claimantcould show changed circumstances from 1985; whether the claimants had improvedon weaknesses in their cases perceived by the Tribunal; certain programsthat were claimed by more than one party; and factors of harm, benefitto cable operators, and marketplace value. Concerning the Nielsen study, MPAA continued to make improvements in itsreliability. It expanded the number of commercial stations in the study,by including stations which reached 80,000 subscribers rather than lastyear's cut-off of 100,000. This resulted in an increase in the number ofcommercial stations measured by the study from 104 in 1985 to 113 in 1986.In addition, MPAA cleared up one point of confusion. The Tribunal had acceptedMultimedia's criticism that the Nielsen data does not measure the viewingof cable subscribers who subscribe to Form 1 or Form 2 cable systems. MPAAestablished in this proceeding, however, that while the choice of whichbroadcast stations should be studied is restricted to their distant signalcarriage by Form 3 systems, once that choice is made, the Nielsen studymeasures the viewing of those broadcast stations by all cable households,including households subscribing to Form 1 or Form 2 systems.The Nielsen data yielded a relative measure of the programs of the threeprogram suppliers as follows: MPAA_99.289%; NAB_0.390%; Multimedia_0.321%.This represented a decrease for NAB from 0.404% to 0.390%, or 3.5%, andan increase for Multimedia from 0.260% to 0.321%, or 23.5%.To obtain these final Nielsen figures, it was necessary to resolve thequestion of the ownership of 11 contested programs between MPAA and NAB.One program, ``Breast Cancer, My Body, My Life,'' was resolved at a hearing,where it was conceded by MPAA that, in fact, two different programs werebeing discussed and there was no conflict at all. Concerning the otherten, it was represented to the Tribunal that MPAA represented the syndicatorof the program and NAB represented the producer. As we established in the1984 cable distribution proceeding, as between the syndicator and the producer,the Tribunal will award the royalties to the syndicator, so here too, theTribunal has determined these programs belong to MPAA's claim. <T3>1984 Cable Royalty Distribution Proceeding, </T3>52 FR 8408, 8410,8418 (March 17, 1987).NAB argued that there existed a difference in this proceeding, that althoughMPAA sought the credit for these programs, the majority of them would notget any payment from MPAA under its own internal distribution system, whereasif NAB were recognized to be the proper representative for those programs,each one of them would get some compensation from NAB. The Tribunal believes,that although NAB's point has a certain appeal, the seeming inequity stemsfrom a choice the syndicator made when he chose to be represented by MPAA,and to accept MPAA's distribution method. If, however, the syndicator feelspenalized by MPAA's system, he can come directly to the Tribunal in PhaseII as Multimedia does.Concerning Group W Westinghouse, the Tribunal is particularly troubledby a circumstance in which Group W could possibly be compensated twice.In this case, Group W is assigned this year by the Tribunal to MPAA forthe reason that it has received compensation from MPAA and has agreed toMPAA's distribution formula. This does not preclude Group W from filingwith either MPAA or NAB in a future proceeding, but it must clearly choose.Challenges to the Nielsen study in the proceeding were based primarilyon allegations of undermeasurement. MPAA argued that the credit the Tribunalhas given the other claimants in the past for undermeasurement of theirprograms was not warranted, because MPAA's programs were equally undermeasured.To advance this argument, MPAA gave examples of how much product its representedgroup has on the nonmeasured stations, and during the nonmeasured periodsof the year. However, the Tribunal always assumed that MPAA had a substantialamount of its programs outside of the Nielsen study, for that was the necessaryassumption the Tribunal had to make in order to project the results ofMPAA's Nielsen study to the entire year. For MPAA to show that its programshave been undermeasured, it would have to show that its relative shareof programming in the unmeasured periods exceeds its 97.5% (excluding unclaimedprograms) relative share of programming in the measured period, or to showthat the other claimants were overmeasured.Overall, however, we consider that MPAA has continued to improve the Nielsenstudy, its claimants maintained their strong standing in the Nielsen data,and has thus demonstrated the marketplace value of its programs.Concerning Multimedia, the statistical way in which Multimedia set outto demonstrate undermeasurement of its specials in this proceeding is differentfrom the way it attempted to show undermeasurement in the last proceeding,and therefore our analysis has to be different. In the 1985 proceeding,Multimedia's exhibit on undermeasurement included one factor that has beenleft out of this year's exhibit_cable subscribership. Cable subscribershipis a factor, because not all distant retransmissions of broadcast signalshave equal impact.This year, Multimedia first alleged that its series and specials were undermeasuredsimply by the fact that \3/4\ of their airings took place on broadcaststations not selected to be in the study. However, as our findings demonstrate,the Nielsen study only chose \1/4\ of all relevant broadcast stations tomeasure, so that Multimedia's programs received approximately average treatment.Multimedia's second exhibit on undermeasurement was misleading becauseit included many nonrelevant broadcast stations, that is, stations thatwere not retransmitted by a Form 3 cable system.It could not be shown from Multimedia's two exhibits whether there wasundermeasurement. Our conclusion of the record is that there was not. Thisis not a contradiction from our finding of last year that there was undermeasurement.The basic criticism advanced by critics of the Nielsen study is that forsmall claimants it can be capricious. One year, it may undermeasure, thenext year, it can overmeasure. Therefore, a claimant must continue to proveundermeasurement in order to get credit for it.Regarding the other indicia of Multimedia's claim, we perceive two indicationsof changed circumstances, the improvement in ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' andthe improvement in the Nielsen study. ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' was syndicatedto more stations in 1986, 46 of which were retransmitted by Form 3 cablesystems. Improvements for ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' were reflected in theNielsen data. Overall, the Nielsen data for all Multimedia programmingimproved Multimedia's relative share by 23.5%.We do not consider that there was changed circumstances for ``Donahue''or for the other programs belonging to Multimedia. For ``Donahue,'' thechanges in ratings tend to prove that ``Donahue,'' remains strong, butare not such as to warrant a finding of changed circumstances. Multimedia'sadvertising and time exhibits were sufficiently impeached by MPAA to precludeany finding of changed circumstances. The time study included many broadcaststations which were not retransmitted by any cable system on a distantsignal basis. So improvements, if there were any, in time on the air mightnot be so for distant signal cable retransmissions. For the other programming,Multimedia did not allege changed circumstances.On the issue of WTBS, Multimedia presented submissions by TBS to the SECand the FCC purporting to show that TBS pays program suppliers a premiumfor their programs because of the special position station WTBS has inthe cable market. However, TBS' submissions were essentially out-of-courtstatements; Multimedia's witness could not answer for the factual truthof the statements contained in them. MPAA's cross examination exhibitswere successful in impeaching the allegations contained in TBS exhibits,so the Tribunal could not give them credit. Multimedia's argument thatthe Tribunal should find that program suppliers who syndicate to WTBS incurno harm because of the alleged premiums they get from WTBS was not proved.Nor could we find that WTBS intentionally schedules its programs, suchas the Goodwill Games, during sweep periods for cable royalties, becausemany other Olympics have been scheduled during July.On the contrary, we are generally persuaded by MPAA's showing that Multimediahas used self-help to avoid harming its distribution of its programs bynot selling to the broadcast stations with the most cable retransmissions.To this extent, the Tribunal believes that Multimedia's award should besomewhat closer to its Nielsen figure.It should be noted that although we have stated numerous times in the pastthat the Nielsen study is the starting point, it is obvious from a readingof our past Phase II decisions that the awards have never been based upona strict application of Nielsen figures. In Phase II, both Multimedia andNAB have long received awards which are several times higher than indicatedby Nielsen data. At the same time, past increases or decreases in Nielsenhave not resulted in the same corresponding percentage of increase or decreasein Multimedia or NAB awards. See, for example, the 1982 and 1984 cabledistribution proceedings. Such changes in Nielsen are but one factor indetermining changed circumstances. Similarly, this year the Tribunal declinesto apply directly Nielsen gains absent consideration of other factors toelevate changed circumstances.In conclusion, regarding Multimedia, we believe that Multimedia's 23% improvementin the Nielsen study, which reflect, among other things, the improvementin ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' is offset by our finding that there was no undermeasurementof Multimedia's specials in 1986, and that Multimedia incurs somewhat lessharm than other program suppliers who syndicate to the broadcast stationswith greater cable retransmissions. Consequently, the Tribunal has determinedto award Multimedia 0.825%, the same as in the last proceeding.Concerning NAB, NAB has improved on the weaknesses in its case which theTribunal perceived in the 1984 proceeding. Whereas in the 1984 proceeding,NAB could not represent to the Tribunal that each one of the broadcaststations listed in Exhibit II-2 were retransmitted by at least one cablesystem on a distant signal basis, this year it was able to. Similarly,NAB took extra steps to confirm and verify the information it had gatheredfrom its represented stations.NAB was also criticized in the 1984 proceeding for offering no proof ofthe marketplace value of its represented programs. The Tribunal particularlynoted that NAB's programs change from year to year so that previously shownmarketplace value for other program could not suffice to establish marketplacevalue for the new programs. NAB produced a witness this year to addressthe marketplace value of NAB's programs. However, while continuing to creditNAB for some value to its programs meriting an award higher than its Nielsenshare, the Tribunal has determined to adjust NAB's share slightly downwardfrom 0.7% to 0.675%, based primarily on a lack of proof that the regionalprograms have as special an appeal to particular audiences as NAB's witnesssaid they do, and based upon MPAA's showing that these regional programsare also available over-the-air from regional broadcast networks.The downward adjustment in NAB's award is not related to any fluctuationin its Nielsen share. As previously noted, the Tribunal has never takenthe statistical result of the Nielsen study as having pin-point accuracy.The 3.5% decline for NAB, from 0.404% to 0.390%, was considered by theTribunal to be de minimis.Concerning NAB's assertion of undermeasurement of its specials in the Nielsenstudy, we first analyzed whether the NAB programs were on selected broadcaststations more or less than the statistical average. Since the Nielsen studymeasured 113 out of 437 stations, or 25.9%, NAB's result of 116 out of395 stations, or 29.4%, being measured, does not show any undermeasurement.However, it would be of no help for a special to be on a selected Nielsenstation if it was aired outside of the sweep periods. 12 of NAB's programswere actually measured by the Nielsen study, but we do not know if theywere measured once or more than once. We are inclined to conclude, however,that NAB's specials were probably undermeasured. To that extent, some amountof undermeasurement has already been built into NAB's award for the pastseveral proceedings. However, our conclusion is frustrated by a lack ofsolid evidence. As we said previously on the issue of undermeasurement,to show it requires putting in the record the broadcast stations whichaired the programs, when, whether the programs were aired within or outsidea Nielsen sweep period, which cable systems carried them, and their subscribership.<ITAG tagnum="84">Allocations </ITAG>Pursuant to the Phase I settlement, the Tribunal has adopted the followingallocation to categories of claimants in Phase I of the 1986 cable copyrightroyalties fees available for distribution.
