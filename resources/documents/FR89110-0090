The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated September 28, 1988, as supplemented November 30, 1988.The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed change to the TS is required to relieve the licensee fromthe unnecessary hardship due to the current requirement to suspend handlingof irradiated fuel if primary containment integrity is not maintained.As a result of this requirement, most Type C leak rate tests required byAppendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 cannot be performed while refueling is inprogress. The requested TS change would permit leak rate testing in parallelwith refueling to reduce the refueling outage duration because a limitednumber of vent and drain pathways could be opened while refueling operationsare underway. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revisions tothe Technical Specifications. The proposed revisions would nodify the provisionsin Technical Specification Definition 1.31 and TS 4.6.1.2 to revise theprimary containment integrity requirements during fuel handling to permitup to twenty vent and drain line pathways to be opened for the purposeof performing local leak rate tests. TS 3.9.4 would be modified to increasethe decay time required for the irradiated fuel from 24 hours to 80 hoursbefore the vent and drain line pathways can be opened for the purpose ofperforming the local leak rate tests. The NRC staff performed an evaluation of the offsite radiological consequencesresulting from a postulated fuel handling accident inside the primary containmentwhile performing Type C leak rate testing with up to 20 vent and drainlines opened. In the River Bend Safety Evaluation Report (NUREG-0989) dated May 1984,the staff previously evaluated a postulated fuel handling accident usingassumptions contained in Positions C.1.a through C.1.k of Regulatory Guide1.25 and the procedures specified in Standard Review Plan (SRP) section15.7.4 (NUREG-0800). A 24 hour delay between shutdown and accident wasused in the evaluation. In addition, the specified assumptions postulatea single dropped fuel assembly, the kinetic energy of which is expendedwith perfect mechanical efficiency in breaking open the maximum possiblenumber of fuel rods. Instantaneous release of noble gases and radioiodinevapor from the gaps of the broken rods occurs as gas bubbles pass up throughthe water covering the fuel. All radioactivity reaching the primary containmentatmosphere is exhausted within 2 hours through engineered safety featurefiltered exhaust systems to the environment. In this current evaluation, the staff performed the offsite dose calculationsusing the same assumptions previously used for a postulated fuel handlingaccident with the following two exceptions: 1. An unmitigated release of 70.2 CFM from the primary containment throughup to 20 open vent and drain lines in addition to the maximum allowableunidentified primary containment leakage of 0.26 percent per day; and 2. A credit was given for 10 percent mixing of airborne radioactive materialwithin primary containment atmosphere prior to release to the secondarycontainment (the licensee proposed 50 percent mixing credit). The offsite doses computed for the River Bend Exclusion Area Boundary (EAB)and Low Population Zone (LPZ) boundaries using the above assumptions, assumptionscontained in Regulatory Guide 1.25, and the procedures specified in StandardReview Plan (SRP) section 15.7.4, were 21 rem to the thyroid and 6 remto the whole body at the EAB and 2.7 rem to the thyroid and 0.6 rem wholebody at the LPZ. These calculated offsite doses are well within the exposureguidelines of 10 CFR 100 and are within the acceptance criteria given inStandard Review Plan section 15.7.4. The change does not otherwise affect the probability or consequences ofany accident. The tasks that the licensee's personnel will perform to accomplish thetests will not be significantly different from those tasks performed duringprevious leak rate testing. Thus, there is no significant increase in theallowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. There are no changes being made in the types of any effluents that maybe released offsite. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would resultin no significant radiological environmental impact. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS involves systems located within the restricted areas as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 24, 1988 (53 FR 41634). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thesenotices. Alternative to the Proposed Action Since the Commission concluded that there is no significant adverse environmentaleffect that would result from the proposed action, alternatives with equalor greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce the impact of plant operations on the environment andwould result in reduced operational flexibility. Alternative Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for the River Bend Station, Unit 1,dated January 1985. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment. Based upon this environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposedaction will not have a significant adverse effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
