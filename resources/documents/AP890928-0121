The Senate responded to the pleas of several legislators,including leading defense figures, who said they were worried thatcontinuing cuts in the space-based defense initiative would causeirreversible damage to the program.   By a vote of 53-47, the Senate adopted an amendment requiringthat $4.3 billion of the money appropriated for the DefenseDepartment in the fiscal year beginning Sunday be spent on StarWars.   On Tuesday, the Senate had voted overwhelmingly, 66-34, to spend$3.7 billion on Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic DefenseInitiative, and lawmakers indicated that the vote reflected anerosion in the support for the program.   But the ranking members of the Senate Armed Services Committee _Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia and John Warner of Virginia _ arguedtoday that the Star Wars total approved Tuesday had underminedtheir bargaining position in negotiations with the House on thedefense authorization bill.   The Senate, in adopting its authorization legislation lastmonth, approved $4.5 billion for Star Wars. The House's defenseblueprint earmarked $3.1 billion for the program.   ``We are being confronted by House conferees unwilling to lookat our number. They are instead taking the appropriations number,''Nunn, a sponsor of the amendment, told his colleagues.   He urged his colleagues to ``send a signal to the Houseconferees'' that the Senate wants a final budget number for StarWars that is close to the fiscal 1989 total of $4.1 billion.   Failure to restore the funds, Nunn said, would ``cut out anynegotiating position we have.''   Warner, another amendment sponsor, said the vote would have a``profound impact on the outcome of the House and Senate conferenceon the authorization bill.''   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., questioned whether senatorsreally believe the House is ``weak-willed and weak-minded'' andwouldn't know ``what's going on here.''   Johnston said the proponents of the amendment have asked theSenate to ``engage in an exercise in self-delusion. ... Why shouldwe have such loyalty to unattainable goals. The goals (of StarWars) are elusive and vague.''   The Senate was expected to complete work on the appropriationsbill today with a handful of amendments on anti-satellite weapons,U.S. troop levels in Europe and Star Wars.   The chamber today approved 95-5 an amendment allowing the use ofDefense Department funds for a multinational anti-narcotics strikeforce if such a group is formed. A total amount was not specified.   The other aspect of the measure, sponsored by Sen. ArlenSpecter, R-Pa., was a non-binding resolution calling on thepresident to allow U.S. involvement in such a strike force. TheAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 had urged the president to enter intonegotiations to create a force.   The other amendments pending:   _Bar funds for anti-satellite weapons tests unless theadministration could certify that the Soviets had engaged in testsof their own, had refused to bargain in good faith in limitationsand had blocked international verification efforts.   _Call for either a reduction of 30,000 American troops stationedin Europe or a requirement that U.S. allies foot the bill for thosepersonnel if NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations fail to reach aconventional arms agreement by Oct. 1, 1990.   _Require that $820 million of the money for Star Wars be usedfor research on lasers and particle beams. Proponents of theamendment expressed concerns that the administration will sacrificelong-term research on directed energy weapons such as lasers andparticle beams in favor of a ``quick fix or a Phase 1 deployment''that would favor the so-called ``Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favoredby many in the administration.   Lawmakers who on Wednesday assessed the damage of the SenateStar Wars vote provided several explanations for the action,including the shrinking defense budget, the decrease in support andrecent comments by Vice President Dan Quayle on the program.   ``It was a straight referendum on this,'' Rep. PatriciaSchroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed Services Committee,said as she pulled an article on Quayle's comments from her filefolder.   The vice president, who was a strong support of Star Wars whenhe served in Congress, a few weeks ago said then-President RonaldReagan's SDI ``astrodome'' approach to protect the United Stateswas ``political jargon.''   ``Members remember his passion'' for Star Wars, Schroeder said.   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, discounted the effect of Quayle's comments as well asthe recent announcement by the Soviet Union that it would separateStar Wars from a treaty reducing strategic arms.   Some lawmakers had suggested the Soviet announcement hadundercut support for Star Wars.   ``It's too soon to factor that in _ the impact of delinking,''Aspin said.   Aspin said the Senate vote ``doesn't represent a watershed'' butrather ``support for the program has been eroding. Watch the voteover the years.''   Kasich said for six years Congress had kept ``sending this moneysomewhere'' without knowing the results and the enthusiasm hasdiminished. The vote, Kasich hopes, will prod the Bushadministration into indicating the future of the program and whatlevel of funding it will accept.   ``The administration has to put a line in the sand on what isnot acceptable to them. I hope this shakes the administration outof its unwillingness to confront this issue in a sharp way,'' hesaid.   ``Every year they're losing more support. They don't have anyprogram or any plan,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
