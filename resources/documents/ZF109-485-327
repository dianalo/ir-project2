ChapmanandM;West Covina, CAandM;A Reviewing StandandM;Guy Kawasaki's column on &quot;Reviewing Reviews&quot; (July '90, page 41) was timelyand well put.andP;  As a former InfoWorld reviews editor, I understand hisconcerns completely.andP;  Publications would be wise to heed his suggestions,especially regarding consistency and completeness.andM;One problem the article cites is inaccuracy.andP;  Unfortunately, there is nocorresponding remedy suggested for it.andP;  In my experience, two key factorshelp ensure accurate reviews.andM;The first is for vendors to publish reviewers' guides that accompany softwareor hardware and to send them with any product destined for review.andM;The second is for a publication to call the vendor to check facts before thereview is published.andP;  Simple as this sounds, many publications don't do it.andO;It doesn't require giving out subjective information, scores, or opinions butrather focuses on features or double-checking benchmarks that appearincorrect.andP;  I've made hundreds of such calls, and they certainly pay off.andM;Serge TimacheffandM;Logitech, Inc.andM;Fremont, CAandM;Car TalkandM;When Paul Somerson compares IBM machines to American cars and the Mac toHondas and BMWs (&quot;Windows Watchers,&quot; August '90, page 25), I think he'smaking a poor analogy.andP;  The Mac is like a BMW but not like a Honda.andP;  Hondaentered the market by providing cheap, well-made transportation.andP;  Peoplebought them in droves, and Honda responded by upgrading the quality of thecars and making them a little bit upscale.andP;  Honda's prices for the Civic andAccord remain competitive with those of domestic models, however.andM;BMW, on the other hand, remains a luxury car.andP;  I just bought a Ford Taurus,and I didn't see enough added value in something such as a BMW to justifyparting with a lot of extra bucks.andP;  I'm not knocking BMW; its car may besignificantly better than my Ford but not enough that I would pay thousandsof extra dollars for the privilege of owning one.andM;Had Apple pursued the Honda strategy, the Mac might be going neck and neckwith IBM machines right now.andP;  My decision on what car to buy was between aTaurus and an Accord, not between a Taurus and a BMW.andP;  As long as Apple wantsto get a significant price premium, it will remain a luxury product to mostpeople, as a BMW is.andP;  To those who argue that the SE and Plus are relativelycheap, I would counter that so are five- and six-year-old BMWS.andM;Mark GuttagandM;Bethesda, MDandM;Broken WindowsandM;In response to Paul Somerson's column on Win3 (August'90, page 25) .... Is ita window of vulnerability? I don't think so.andP;  As a new Mac SE/30 user, I amvery familiar with Windows 2.0 as well as with Win3.andM;When I first saw Windows, my interest was piqued because of its contrast tothe drab and lifeless DOS interface used by so many software packages.andP;  In mycase, I found out what the Mac was all about by first dipping my feet intothe Windows pond.andP;  The problem is that once you get used to the water, younotice that the Windows pond is rather shallow.andM;There were so many things I wanted to be able to do in Windows that Icouldn't.andP;  Don't misunderstand me, Win3 is a good product for some people.andO;But where I work, it's like pulling teeth to get anyone to even look at aWindows application.andM;I think the hoopla given to Windows may backfire when people plunk down thecash for more RAM, a 20-inch monitor (useless in my opinion), and (for some)a first mouse, only to find that they still can't accomplish as much as theirsecretary does with a Mac.andM;Kevin SauterandM;Dallas, TXandM;My biggest problem with Windows is when things go wrong.andP;  I could probablytell you 20 ways to crash it.andP;  Until today, the worst crash happened a fewweeks ago and left my FAT table  file-allocation table, for those of youlucky enough not to have to know DOS) with my COMMAND.COM file pointing atone of my data files (try deleting the Finder, renaming your Word documentFinder, and putting it in your System Folder to get an idea).andM;But that was nothing compared with today's crash.andP;  I was working on a seriesof documents when I got the standard Windows error message saying that theSystem had been corrupted.andP;  So I thought, &quot;Here we go again.andP;  ..&quot; and triedto reboot.andP;  Once again, I got the DOS &quot;not a system disk&quot; message, so Ibooted from a floppy and did a directory on my hard disk, only to find abunch of files with strange characters for filenames.andM;It seems that Windows had somehow overwritten the aforementioned FAT table.andO;The hard disk is trashed - all my programs are lost.andP;  I'm not sure whatcaused this (aside from the fact that IBM PCs and I do not get along - theymust know I have a Macintosh at home), but I will not be using Windows againin the near future.andM;Richard W. MartinandM;Raleigh, NCandM;Outlining SolutionsandM;I just finished reading with great interyour August '90 article entitled&quot;Capturing Font Outlines&quot; (page 210).andP;  1 was glad to see an article dealingwith the topic, as I haven't seen one before.andM;Of your nine solutions, however, not one used my method.andP;  I use LetraStudio(a program superior to TypeStyler), Adobe Illustrator 88, and some method ofPostScript printing (because you're dealing with capturing PostScriptoutlines).andP;  LetraStudio 1.5 lets you save any file in Illustrator 1.andP;  Inative format.andP;  Enter what you need (even the whole font set) in LetraStudio,accomplish any type manipulations, and choose the Illustrator 1.andP;  I formatoption in the Save dialog box.andP;  You can open this file in Illustrator andhave editable outlines !andP;  Damion DesaiandM;Redondo Beach, CAandM;At the time the article was written, LetraStudio 1.5 and FontStudio had notbeen released.andP;  The previous version of LetraStudio did not support Type 1 orType 3 fonts.andP;  Two  other  products not mentioned in the article, Altsys'Fontographer and Image Club's Evolution, -an also create outline fonts.andO;Although both Letraset products can produce font outlines, their priceprecludes buying them for that task alone.andP;  In addition, LetraStudio'soutlines have a large number of control points, which makes editingdifficult.andP;  -AAandM;Future PerfectandM;Apple should bring out the following products:andM;A $700 16-megahertz 68000 machine with a single SuperDrive, a SCSI port, anda port (with built-in circuitry) for a larger monitor.andP;  Two megabytes shouldbe standard.andP;  It should come in a compact Mac case.andM;A $1,200 16-megahertz 68000 machine with a single SuperDrive, a SCSI port, abuilt-in color monitor (with provisions for a second monitor).andP;  Two megabytesshould be standard.andP;  It should come in a compact Mac case.andM;A $2,000 16-megahertz 68030 machine (with math coprocessor), a singleSuperDrive, a SCSI port, built-in support for a color monitor, and threeNuBus slots.andP;  Four megabytes should be standard, and this model should be ina IIcx case.andM;And here's a lightweight model: a $3,000 16-megahertz portable Mac and Appleshould license the ROMs to Toshiba for manufacturing.andM;Perhaps licensing the ROMs to a select group of companies would be the way togo.andP;  Just look at the money that Adobe makes from PostScript royalties !andO;Stephen CaldwellandM;Wurtsmith AFB, MIandM;Apple hasn't gone so far as to license ROMs yet, but it did recently reach anagreement with Outbound Systems of Boulder, Colorado, concerning thatcompany's Macintosh-ROM-based portable machine.andP;  - JBandM;The Envelope PleaandM;In the September '90 Tip Sheet (page 349), Michael Conley supplied a tipabout using SuperGlue to fool our product KiwiEnvelopes 3 into producingoutput for a dot-matrix printer.andM;Tests administered in close cooperation with the U.S.andP;  Postal Serviceindicate that dot-matrix printers cannot position a print job preciselyenough to produce valid bar codes.andP;  We disabled the bar-code feature fordot-matrix printers deliberately, and this is documented in our manual.andM;A bad bar code makes your mail move more slowly through the postal systemthan no bar code at all.andM;Pete GontierandM;Kiwi Software, Inc.andM;Santa Barbara, CAandM;SCSI HeadachesandM;As a big fan of your magazine which has saved me lots of money and solvedseveral nasty technical problems - I still say your technical people havebeen dodging the toughest technical problem out there: SCSI issues.andP;  ThankGod you had the hair to publish Thom Hogan's article (&quot;A Beginner's Guide toDaisy Chains,&quot; August '90, page 243).andP;  The accompanying graphic caught thestate of the art perfectly.andP;  What good's another speedy peripheral if youcan't hook it up?andM;Because you have knowledgeable technicians, please put more time and effortinto finding logical, consistent ways to connect SCSI devices.andM;John SweeneyandM;Seattle, WAandM;We last covered SCSI in depth in December '89 (&quot;SCSI Solutions,&quot; page 229),but you can be sure we'll be returning to the topic.andP;  In the meantime, see&quot;Dear Ml-.andP;  Sculley&quot; for a chance to let Apple know what you think aboutstandards such as SCSI.andP;  - JBandM;Fast FormsandM;I was pleased to see MacUser's review of Fast Forms 2.0 (September '90, page73).andP;  Our research confirms that there are two types of Mac users who haveforms needs: professional form creators and those who need forms to maketheir business more efficient.andM;There is one technical inaccuracy I'd like to correct.andP;  MacUser stated thatFast Forms &quot;cannot deal with the importation of EPS graphics.andP;  It convertsany graphic into a bit-mapped image when it places it in a document.&quot;andM;Fast Forms pastes graphics in PICT format directly from the Clipboard.andP;  ThePICT format can represent object-oriented graphics as well as bit maps.andO;Although the PICT is displayed as a bit map on-screen (72 dpi), when youprint it, Fast Forms uses the available resolution of the printing device.andM;Steve SchafferandM;Power Up SoftwareandM;San Mateo, CAandM;First-Class Mall OrderandM;I see many letters complaining about a vendor's service or support, so Ithought it might be nice to send you something positive for a change.andM;MacBEAT, a new mail-order house, specializes in just one thing: letting theMac make music.andP;  Its prices are as low as, or lower than, those of the majormail-order houses for music software, but the real reason to deal with it issupport.andP;  It does not just take your order and ship it.andP;  The staff memberspoint out programs that handle what you want to do.andP;  Twice they steered meaway from programs I thought I wanted to ones that were cheaper and still dideverything I needed.andP;  How often has your favorite mail-order house gone outof its way to save you $100?andM;James G. HaberlyandM;Mission Hills, CAandM;Not very often - which is one reason why we'll be focusing on how to be asmart consumer in an upcoming issue.andP;  Maybe then view get more letters fromsatisfied customers.andP;  - VvBandM;Guy and GunsandM;I think it presumptuous of Guy Kawasaki to assume that all (or even most) ofhis readers will identify with his bigoted views regarding the NRA (NationalRifle Association).andP;  His comparison of Microsoft to the NRA (It's a WindowfulLife,&quot; September '90, page 33) is inaccurate to the point of absurdity andlogically indefensible.andM;I hold no illusions that I could ever change his opinions on the gun issue,so I will not waste time on that endeavor.andP;  What I may be able to accomplish,though (if I am joined by a great enough number of my fellow subscribers), isto keep that sort of political nonsense off the pages of a magazine that issupposed to be concerned with computers.andM;Allan BreitenbachandM;Farmington, NMandM;System 7.0 ...andM;I read with interest Thom Hogan's column in the September '90 issue (page321) but was surprised to see no option for partitioning your hard disk torun Systems 6.x and 7.0 on different partitions.andM;I recently installed a 120-megabyte hard-disk drive in my SE/30; boughtLaCie's Silver Lining; and partitioned my drive, anticipating running eachSystem on a different partition.andM;Is this not a preferable way to do what you recommend?andM;Larry AndersonandM;Largo, FLandM;We asked Thom the same qestion when we first read his column.andP;  He referred usto his first column for MacUser (&quot;The Case of the Quirky Computer,&quot; March'90, page 211), where the ultimate culprit for a nightmarish sequence ofsystem crashes turned out to be disk-partitioning software.andM;Thom doesn't recommend this approach while you're breaking  in System 7.0.andP;  -andO;JBandM;.  .  .  and CountingandM;System 7.0 seems to be vaporware to the same extent that FullWrite was.andP;  Ifound the first reference to System 7.0 in the August'89 MacUser! We've sincehad a full year of issues telling us of how System 7.0 is the greatest thingsince sliced bread.andP;  Whatever happened to the MacUser pledge of not reviewingsomething until it was released?andM;Of the features that have not yet been dropped from System 7.0, how many arereally useful and significant advances from where we are now? Is virtualmemory really helpful? I have a Mac IIci with 8 megabytes of memory andhaven't run out of memory.andP;  Virtual memory stores things on-disk, and disk isslow.andP;  1, for one, don't want to sit around and wait for the disk to accessduring a spreadsheet calculation !andP;  If I have something on my Macintosh thatneeds more than 8 megabytes of memory, then I know my Mac is too small amachine and that I need to use my mainframe.andP;  Likewise, if a calculationtakes more than half an hour, I should use my mainframe.andM;I have yet to see much use in all the so-called nifty features of System 7.0.andO;Furthermore, I plan to wait for at least a year until most of the bugs havebeen sorted out before I even install it.andM;Alan TouchberryandM;Saint Louis Park, MNandM;We haven't reviewed  System 7.0 yet and won't do so until it is released as ashipping product, which Apple currently says will be in December  1990.andP;  And,if it all works as promised, System 7.0 will  be the most significant Macoperatting-system upgrade to date.andP;  Besides providing a better Finder, System7.0 will improve the applications we buy.andP;  For example, interapplicationcommunication will allow linking of programs from different vendors, and theCommunications  Toolbox will  create a consistent plug-and-play interfacecommunications software.andM;As for virtual memory, I can remember time when  people said,  128K RAM: I'llnever need that much memory!&quot; Macintosh applications show no signs of slowingtheir memory-size inflation.andP;  You can continue  to use your  mainframe if youwish, but most users find it easier (and quite a bit cheaper) to use theirMacs.-JRandM;Knight LineandM;The Bobker's Dozen review of ZTerm in the September '90 issue (page 39) saysthat the Zmodem protocol is supported only by ZTerm and MicroPhone 11.andP;  Notso - White Knight also supports Zmodem.andM;James W. WalkerandM;Columbia, SCandM;Worth the WeightandM;As a consultant and busy owner of a graphic-design/desktop-publishingbusiness, I've developed a fast system for reading through the volumes ofMac-related periodicals to which I subscribe.andP;  MacUser, being one of myfavorite publications, usually gets an immediate read through, but yourSeptember '90 issue was a killer.andP;  That thing was so full of usefulinformation that I found myself reading features while talking to clients onthe phone.andM;When I first pulled the September issue from the mailbox, I joked with myassistant about its weight (&quot;What's in here, an encyclopedia?&quot;).andP;  Howrefreshing to find that the extra weight was predominantly due to more pagesof relevant editorial and not a 50-page mail-order-house insert.andM;A.M.andP;  ConcepcionandM;Chicago, ILandM;RagTime ReduxandM;Russell Ito was correct to state that RagTime checks the network for multiplecopies running with the same serial number  &quot;Letters,&quot; September '90, page18).andP;  But RagTime does this only on startup, printing, and about every tenminutes during normal operation.andP;  This means that additional network trafficis in the range of a tenth of a percent of the normal traffic on a LocalTalknetwork.andM;For large account customers, who find the necessity of installing a separatecopy of RagTime at every workplace irritating, RagTime USA offerssite-license agreements that allow the use of an unprotected copy of thesoftware on the customer's network.andM;Thomas Everth, PresidentandM;RagTime USAandM;Redwood City, CAandM;Graphic WordsandM;I liked the MacUset- &quot;Guide to Graphics Formats&quot; (September'90, page 266).andO;It is a great help in the office when explaining graphics to IBMers.andM;Unfortunately, I can only give it a B+, not for what it includes but for whatit doesn't.andP;  Speaking for myself, I have become a great fan of FullWriteProfessional and it wasn't on the program compatibility list.andM;My use of FullWrite and its drawing program leads me to prefer it to otherwriting/drawing packages.andP;  When I import to FullWrite's drawing subprogram,it seems to do everything I need it to do - display, edit, and print.andO;Perhaps it does not do everything on the graphics list, but without it beingincluded, not too many people will know.andM;Bud WillnerandM;Vienna, VAandM;Because of the issue's time and space constraints, we decided to limit theGraphics Format poster  to graphics-specific programs.andP;  Programs that focusprimarily on word processing, such as FullWrite Professional, were thereforenot included.andP;  -- AAandM;Puzzling Evidence?andM;As sysop of the Los Angeles Macintosh Group BBS, I was quite happy to readJohn Rizzo's article detailing some of the features available in Apple's newCommunications Toolbox (&quot;Communications Toolbox,&quot; September '90, page 295).andM;There is one thing I find just a wee bit alarming, though .... The icons forthe communication tools in Figure 2 seem to be shaped like pieces fro ajigsaw puzzel.andP;  Unfortunately, and I hope this isn't an omen of things tocome, the pieces don't look like they'll fit together very well.andM;Reed HutchinsonandM;Los Angeles, CA</TEXT></DOC>
