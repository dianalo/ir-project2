The datashow that potentially transportable rRNP-particles inside nuclei arenot free, but are subject to a complex retention which is gradually diminishedunder export conditions and augmented under non-permissive export conditionswith increasing temperatures. The authors suggest that the retentionmechanisms involve temperature-sensitive intranuclear domains of thenuclear matrix.</TEXT></DOC>
