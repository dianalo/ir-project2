Officers Are Spies</HEAD><BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Shiite Moslem Amal militia todaydismissed its security chief in a rift in the forces searching forkidnapped U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in south Lebanon.   Ousted security chief Mustafa Dirani issued a statement thatmade no mention of his dismissal, but claimed that Higgins andother United Nations peacekeeping officials in Lebanon were paid byNATO to gather information about terrorists.   Amal said in a terse statement that Dirani was ``relieved fromhis responsibility as head of the central security system.'' It didnot elaborate.   Higgins, 43, was abducted Feb. 17 near Tyre, 50 miles south ofBeirut. Higgins headed an observer group assigned to the UnitedNations Interim Force in Lebanon, a peacekeeping force in southLebanon.   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimedit abducted Higgins and alleged he was a CIA spy. U.S. and U.N.officials denied the accusation.   Higgins is one of nine Americans among 25 foreigners missing andbelieved kidnapped in Lebanon.   ``Regarding the American officer, I would like to stress that wehave confirmed information that NATO is seeking to confront what itcalls terrorism ... by forming security systems specialized inLebanon to gather information in preparation for acts of piracy inthe future,'' Dirani said.   ``For this purpose, NATO uses some U.N. officers and some UNIFILofficers,'' he said in the handwritten statement.   Dirani criticized Amal for seizing members of the fundamentalistIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon duringthe dragnet for Higgins. Amal is fighting the Iranian-backedHezbollah for control of south Lebanon. Tyre is an Amal stronghold.   ``We denounce the security arrangements that followed theabduction of the American officer,'' Dirani said.   Amal's military commander in Tyre, Daoud Daoud, has been leadinga massive search for Higgins. His militiamen have rounded up atleast 42 Hezbollah members.   Daoud told reporters today that ``we believe Higgins is still inthe south.'' He made no comment on Dirani's allegations.   An Amal spokesman in Beirut said Lebanon's senior Shiite cleric,Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddine, is involved ``in a quiet effortto release Higgins.'' He refused to elaborate and spoke oncondition he not be identified.   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite zealots loyal to Iran's AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini, is believed to be an umbrella for pro-Iranianfactions holding most of the 25 missing foreigners.   Amal, the main Shiite militia led by Justice Minister NabihBerri, is more secular and is backed by Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon. The two Shiite factions have been vying forcontrol of south Lebanon.   The longest held hostage in Lebanon is Terry A. Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. he was seizedin west Beirut on March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
