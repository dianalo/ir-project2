On the advice of the country's major banks, the government shelved plans to sell its remaining interest in the auto maker earlier this year after Volkswagen's widely publicized 473 million-mark ($259.8 million) loss from a foreign-exchange fraud clouded prospects for a share offering. At that time, the government's stake was valued at about 1.6 billion marks ($878.9 million).    Following new bank advice, however, Mr. Stoltenberg said the government will consider in October the sale of the stake. A sale of the shares would put revenue from the government's various denationalizations this year &quot;very substantially&quot; above the 3.3 billion-mark target in the 1987 budget, he said.    Mr. Stoltenberg said the Finance Ministry will begin reconsidering the VW sale after he returns from the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington. The reconsideration will come as Bonn is confronted with a widening budget deficit because of slower-than-expected economic growth. The budget shortage is likely to get even bigger with the start of major tax cuts planned for 1988.    VW's share price has been steadily recovering since falling to a low of around 320 marks in March following the disclosure of the foreign-exchange scandal; the stock stood at 395 marks at the close of trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Tuesday. Analysts said the relatively steady performance of the stock despite the currency fraud is a major reason for the banks' recommendation.    Yesterday, however, Mr. Stoltenberg's announcement caused VW shares to fall 9.5 marks ($5.22), to 385.50 marks ($211.73). Analysts said the market was wary of another VW stock issue because the auto maker's rights issue late last year was poorly received.    Overall, however, the Frankfurt market wasn't much affected by the announcement yesterday.    In the first half, VW's group net income rose 7%, to 304 million marks from 284 million marks a year earlier, confirming manangement's assurances that the foreign-exchange fraud won't affect 1987 earnings. The group forecast that full-year earnings will hover at 1986's record level.    But prospects for the world auto market are less bright for 1988. There may be some pressure on the government to sell its stake before earnings crumble next year, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
