Bennington has written an important book.andP;  Though nominally astudy of future federal telecommunications needs, it really deals with thepast, present and future of information resources management, sketched outagainst a backdrop of societal, political and technological trends.andM;It is unfortunate that this study, Beyond FTS 2000: A Program for Change, hasnot been made more widely available.andP;  Printed in limited quantities by theNational Research Council, it contains the results of Bennington's researchwhile he was on a one-year sabbatical from the General ServicesAdministration.andM;The report is organized into two sections, one on society and government andthe second on information technology.andP;  The coverage of society and governmentis subdivided further into a review of trends in society.andM;The book is thoroughly documented, but without the references and copiousfootnotes that make so many studies of this kind read like graduate theses.andM;It also avoids the ponderous prose typical of official government reports.andO;It is informally, almost breezily, written and contains a disclaimer that &quot;itwould be wrong to characterize the report and its conclusions as other thanthe idiosyncratic views of the author.&quot;andM;Another qualifier has to do with scope.andP;  Bennington is concerned withinformation technology as it is applied within the federal government toimprove its operations, and not with the broader role of government innational information policy issues.andM;But the scope of the report is nonetheless wide.andP;  The author seeks answers tothese questions: &quot;Where do society, the government and information technologystand as we enter the 1990s?andP;  How did we get here?andP;  What is important?andP;  Whatis not?andP;  What is likely to happen in the immediate future?andP;  And what shouldthe government be doing concerning its own use of information technology forthe next 20 years?&quot;andM;Considering this ambitious agenda, Bennington wisely disclaims any attempt todevelop new statistics or new models.andP;  The report, in its author's words,&quot;examines the work of other authors and the opinions of experts who gavetheir time to discuss topics.andP;  It integrates the whole, draws conclusions andrecommends an action plan for government.&quot;andM;The study has other limitations.andP;  Alternative scenarios of the future offederal information are not developed in any detail.andP;  And the lengthy sectionon technology trends, which takes up more than half the book, could have beentied more closely to government needs and issues.andM;But Bennington shows a mastery of his subject and a keen insight into howgovernmental needs and technology trends are likely to converge.andM;He points out, for example, that with the U.S.andP;  population expected toincrease 24 percent during the next 50 years before leveling off, &quot;the sheernumber of transactions that the government will process in its major programs(such as the administration of Social Security, other payments to individualsand collection of revenue) will increase.&quot;andM;The implications for federal agency information managers are obvious.andP;  Andfrightening.andM;Withn respect to federal employment, the report notes that &quot;the number offederal employees per capita of the population ...andP;  is expected to declinefurther as the population increases (nearly a 30 percent decline for the30-year period up to the year 2000).&quot;andM;What does this mean to the IRM practitioner?andP;  For one thing, the decline hasbeen accompanied by the rise of a &quot;shadow force&quot; of contractor staff that isbigger than the work force.andM;The effect of these demographics on future government operations induce, inthis reviewer at least, a strong feeling of pessimism.andM;&quot;We can expect intense competition nationally for skilled entry-levelworkers,&quot; Bennington writes.andM;&quot;The danger is that the government will increasingly become the employer oflast resort, and we will end up with government as the refuge of themarginally competent.&quot;andM;Can information technology offer major help?andM;Bennington thinks so, saying: &quot;Information technology applied to a legion ofinformation workers is a proven tool for automating support functions toimprove the productivity of the individual worker, computer aid of functionssuch as processing casework, preparing statistics and office automation;replacing workers by automating their jobs; and improving overall efficiencywith communications that aid coordination.&quot;andM;I think the author wiould agree that the issue is not one of availability oftechnology resources but of having the will to acquire and apply them.andM;Robert V.
