Rohatyn to the Urban League of Greater New York:    Greed and corruption are the cancer of a free society. They are a cancer because they erode our value system. They create contempt for many of our institutions as a result of the corrupt actions of individuals. The continuity of institutions is too important to be sacrificed to the unfettered greed of individuals. I have been in business for almost 40 years and I cannot recall a period in which greed and corruption appeared as prevalent as they are today. . . . When the financial community is rocked with insider-trading scandals, it goes far beyond a few, or even many, arbitragers, investment bankers or lawyers admitting to criminal behavior. It is the integrity of our financial system that is stained, an institution which has fueled American growth and prosperity since securities legislation was enacted in 1933 and 1934. . . .    Poverty is not a virtue, nor is wealth a sin. But the picture of unfettered greed and corruption presently on the covers of national magazines and on the everyday news could unleash a vicious backlash against institutions as well as individuals. Individuals who break the law have to be punished; institutions have to be reformed. As a result of the ongoing revelations of scandals, the securities industry will have to accept new legislation and regulation to curb the speculative abuses of the past several years. This is long overdue. Instead of trying to fight against the inevitable, financial-industry leaders should cooperate with the Congress in the coming legislative hearings to help shape rational laws and rules to reform the system. If they do, the institution that is our financial market system will emerge stronger and cleaner from its inevitable torment; if they do not, the resulting legislation may be so punitive as to result in detriment to all. </TEXT></DOC>
