Milken was less than one hour away from beingpublicly charged as the biggest financial criminal inhistory. A federal grand jury in Manhattan was about toaccuse him of a sweeping array of crimes that includedinsider trading, bribery, cheating customers and his formeremployer, Drexel Burnham Lambert, and destroyingincriminating evidence.   His chances of winning the case in court, most of hislawyers and advisers told him, were slim.</LP><TEXT>   Thus, the billionaire financier who had spent so much ofhis energy and funds insisting over the past few years thathe had done nothing wrong, made a stunning reversal lastFriday afternoon, agreeing to plead guilty to six felonycounts and pay $600 million in fines and restitution. Five ofthe six counts carry prison terms of up to five years; thesixth provides a three-year maximum. With his actual plea setfor tomorrow, Mr. Milken could still change his mind andrefuse to settle the case.   The magnitude of the settlement is undoubtedly historic,far stiffer than the guilty plea to one felony count and the$100 million payment extracted from arbitrager Ivan Boesky.But how big a coup the Milken plea is for the government,given the magnitude and scope of the crimes it was preparedto allege, will depend on how much Mr. Milken cooperates withgovernment investigators.   Mr. Milken's plea agreement includes a promise ofcooperation with the probe, and given the government'sprevious allegations of wrongdoing involving prominentsavings and loan executives and corporate raiders, Mr. Milkencould conceivably vault the insider-trading investigation toan entirely new plane. But, in an unusual departure fromprecedent, Mr. Milken will be sentenced before he speaks withprosecutors, depriving them of their main leverage over theformer junk-bond empire builder should he prove recalcitrant.   Indeed, given the asserted strength of the government'scase, and the public outcry that followed the plea agreementwith Mr. Boesky, the government is likely to face intensequestioning about why it accepted any plea agreement with Mr.Milken that, unlike the Boesky agreement, failed to containironclad guarantees that Mr. Milken could implicate othercriminals.   If nothing else, Mr. Milken's three years of insisting onhis innocence and massive defense effort seem to have taxedthe government's stamina. The original U.S. attorney on thecase, Rudolph Giuliani, resigned, as have two heads of theoffice's fraud section who were supervising the Milken case.At the Securities and Exchange Commission, both the chief ofenforcement in charge of the Milken case and his top deputyhave resigned for jobs in private practice.   Still, a Milken guilty plea will save the government yearsof a costly trial and goes a long way toward vindicating thegovernment, which has been the target of stinging attacks byMr. Milken and his public relations apparatus during its longinvestigation. After his indictment last March, Mr. Milkencontinued to denounce government prosecutors for engaging ina &quot;shadow trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based uponfalse accusations.&quot;   In return for his guilty plea, Mr. Milken effectivelyhalts a public airing of the vast amounts of evidencecollected by prosecutors since their first, 98-countindictment of him in March of last year. The evidence goesfar beyond the earlier charges of insider trading andsecurities fraud.   People familiar with the investigation say that the newinformation largely was provided by former Milken aides JamesDahl, Terren Peizer and Cary Maultasch, and by Mr. Milken'sold firm, Drexel Burnham, which itself agreed to plead guiltyto six felonies and pay $650 million in fines and restitutionin December 1988. Messrs. Dahl and Peizer were grantedimmunity from prosecution in return for their testimony.Prosecutors agreed to defer indefinitely charges against Mr.Maultasch as a result of his cooperation. More than a dozenadditional witnesses are said to have provided corroboratinginformation to the government, people familiar with the probesay.   Mr. Dahl is understood to have widened the investigationdramatically by testifying about an arrangement under whichMr. Milken allegedly helped a favored client, ColumbiaSavings andamp; Loan Association, violate tax laws. (No chargeshave been filed against Columbia. The company has confirmedthat it is under investigation, and it has deniedwrongdoing.)   Messrs. Maultasch and Peizer are said to have provided thegovernment with information suggesting that Mr. Milken mayhave obstructed justice by ordering the destruction ofdocuments in 1986, after it was learned that Mr. Boesky wasunder investigation.   Mr. Peizer also is said to have told prosecutors that Mr.Milken helped David Solomon, the former chief investmentofficer of Solomon Asset Management, to violate tax laws. Mr.Solomon, for his part, also became a witness against Mr.Milken, confirming his illegal tax arrangement and providingadditional information on a London-based partnershipmasterminded by Mr. Milken. The partnership, known asFinsbury Partners, allegedly cheated its customers byovercharging for securities.   Drexel is understood to have led the government toinvestigate Mr. Milken's relationship with anotherpartnership known as MacPherson Partners. According toDrexel's information, Mr. Milken allegedly used MacPherson aspart of a payola scheme: If certain money managers would buysecurities that Drexel had difficulty marketing, the clientswould be given the chance to participate personally in thelucrative partnership. The government had been expected tocharge Mr. Milken in a new indictment with arranging todefraud investors who might otherwise have benefited fromownership of warrants held by the partnership.   A spokesman for Mr. Milken declined comment on the newcharges and all other aspects of this story. Governmentspokespeople also declined comment.   According to people familiar with the course of thesettlement talks, the discussions began back in January of1989. Then, Mr. Milken was offered the chance to plead guiltyto two felony counts. Prosecutors acceded to Mr. Milken'sdemand that his brother receive immunity from prosecution,people familiar with the talks say.   But when the prosecutors' deadline for a decision arrived,Mr. Milken wasn't taking phone calls. He later refused theoffer, though it met most of the conditions he had originallyset. Friends say Mr. Milken, distraught at the prospect ofadmitting guilt, had pulled back from the brink of asettlement and resolved once again to take his case to ajury.   Throughout the spring and summer of last year, Mr. Milkenand his legal team racked up more than $2 million a month inlegal fees preparing Mr. Milken's trial defense. They weededthrough hundreds of cartons of documents stored in agovernment warehouse. They drafted dozens of legal briefs andmemos. And they commissioned expert studies on the operationsof the financial markets in an effort to demonstrate thatthere had been no wrongdoing.   Some time during this period, the defense team receivedstunning news: copies of handwritten profit and loss tallieson allegedly illegal trades done by Mr. Milken and Mr. Boeskywere in the hands of prosecutors. Defense lawyers hadbelieved that Mr. Boesky had destroyed the documents, but thepapers had in fact been kept by Mr. Boesky's bookkeeper,Setrag Mooradian, who was cooperating with the government.This news convinced some members of the Milken legal teamthat their case was in serious trouble.   More bad news came from the six-week trial last summer ofDrexel trader Bruce Newberg and five others. Many of theaccusations leveled by the government in its first-ever trialof securities firm officials on racketeering charges involvedMr. Milken and Drexel. All six defendants were convicted.   By early fall, the fighting spirit of the Milken teamappeared to be flagging. Mr. Milken authorized Arthur Liman,a partner at the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,Wharton and Garrison, and New York defense attorney StephenE. Kaufman to begin another round of negotiations withprosecutors.   For months, the delicate negotiations remained shrouded insecrecy, hidden even from the SEC and from other defenselawyers involved in the case.   By early February, agreement had been reached on mostdetails of the six felony counts to which Mr. Milken isexpected to plead guilty tomorrow in federal court inManhattan. The fate of Mr. Milken's brother, Lowell Milken,remained a small obstacle -- prosecutors weren't at this timewilling to drop charges against him.   But then word of the negotiations began to leak, and SECChairman Richard Breeden, learning that months of talks hadoccurred without SEC input, demanded that his agency have itssay.   The SEC immediately took a hard line, asking among otherthings that Mr. Milken provide information on savings andloan chiefs who were once Mr. Milken's clients, peoplefamiliar with the talks say. Mr. Milken's lawyers flatlyrefused, and talks became so tense that Mr. Milken's defenseteam threatened to walk away from the table.   A little more than a week ago, the SEC softened itsdemand, clearing the way for a deal that could be presentedto Mr. Milken.   The unusual agreement on cooperation would still leave thegovernment with some leverage should he attempt to withholdinformation, people familiar with the case say. Thegovernment could cite him for breach of the plea agreementand seek a resentencing. They could also use his lack ofcooperation to oppose any motions for early release fromprison, and he could be held in contempt for failing torespond to questions from a grand jury.   For his part, Mr. Milken can argue that he didn'timplicate friends and former clients in order to reduce hissentence, or agree to implicate them in obtaining his plea.   Prosecutors told Mr. Milken's lawyers they would ask for asubstantial prison sentence but they agreed not to seek anyspecific sentence. They also agreed that of the $600 millionpayment, $200 million would constitute fines and $400 millionwill be set aside to satisfy the claims of investors andclients who allegedly lost money because of Mr. Milken'scriminal acts. The fine would leave Mr. Milken among thenation's wealthiest individuals, with an estimated net worthof nearly $1 billion.   The plea agreement also would grant Mr. Milken immunityfrom prosecution anywhere else in the nation, a provisionthat required the approval of U.S. Attorney General RichardThornburgh. The agreement would dismiss criminal chargesagainst Mr. Milken's brother Lowell, a former top aide, whowould be permanently barred from the securities industry andwould have to sign a consent decree with the Securities andExchange Commission. He may also face civil penalties.   The agreement leaves unclear the status of Bruce Newberg,who was charged along with Mr. Milken in the firstindictment, and of former Milken aides Peter Gardiner, AlanRosenthal and Warren Trepp, who were expected to be indictedalong with Mr. Milken.   Although Mr. Milken's decision to plead may finallyrelieve him of some of the considerable stress associates sayhe has felt in recent months, it wasn't an easy one for himto make.   The government had given him a deadline of noon on Fridayto accept the deal, but he let the deadline pass -- as he hadthe first time a settlement was offered last year.   Mr. Milken remained in his Encino, Calif., home with hiswife, Lori, and his mother, Fern. The three had beentogether, talking, since the early hours of a tense morning.The phone rang insistently, but the trio took no calls.Meanwhile, in Manhattan, the federal grand jury was poisedfor a rare Friday session in which it would be asked toapprove the array of new charges.   Although Mr. Milken's attorneys had spent hundreds ofhours with him over a nearly four-year period, even theydidn't know how Mr. Milken would decide. It was midafternoonNew York time, only minutes before the grand jury wasscheduled to vote on the new indictment, when Mr. Milkenfinally ended the suspense.   ---        Landmarks in the Drexel-Milken Investigation                                                                                                          May 1986 -- The SEC and federal prosecutors accuseDrexel's Dennis Levine of making $12.6 million ininsider-trading profits while employed at four differentfirms.
