Family-oriented measures have been on theback-burner since the opening day of Ronald Reagan's firstterm, waiting for the &quot;right moment&quot; that never comes. Smuglycomplacent, the presidents' men have asked: &quot;Where else canthe social conservative go? To the Democrats?&quot;   As an answer, I offer a story of long ago and far away.Shortly after 1900, sociologists began to document anaccelerating decay in Sweden's family life. The birthrate wastumbling, and growing numbers of young adults were unmarried.</LP><TEXT>   Among the politicians, there appeared to be little concernamong the socialists. Swedish conservatives, though, found anissue here. They linked the problem to the fracturing of theChristian world view and demanded action. In the 1908-16period, the Conservative Party pushed proposals for apunitive tax on bachelors and the childless, an idea thatfoundered on the opposition of (libertarian-style) Liberals.The only conservative family measures to win approval were1911 laws that prohibited the sale or distribution ofcontraceptives.   The conservatives tried again in 1931, proposing a specialfamily tax deduction. As a party spokesman explained, &quot;It ishigh time that we abandon the negative or indifferentposition . . . and instead seek through positive measures topromote family creation and to ease the tax burden of largefamilies.&quot; Yet this initiative also collapsed, the morepragmatic figures on the right fretting over the negativefiscal impact of a tax cut for families.   In 1932, the Social Democrats won control of thegovernment. Yet with the social crisis growing, conservativeswere confident. The family was &quot;their issue.&quot; That decadeshad passed without real achievement on their part seemedtrivial alongside the left's avoidance of the question.   In truth, though, not all of the left was asleep. &quot;Ideajournals&quot; were filled during the 1920s with probing,unorthodox articles on family and population issues. In 1931,the socialist quarterly Tiden carried an essay that marked abreakthrough on the family issue. It focused on the growingeconomic and social pressures faced by young couples, linkedtheir plight to blind market forces, and used their problemsto justify a new round of state activism.   In 1934, two young Swedish socialists, Gunnar and AlvaMyrdal, fleshed out this approach in a book that transformedthe family debate overnight. Wistful conservative sentimentsabout the family fell before a rigorous and compelling (ifsubtly flawed) argument that the right was unprepared toanswer.   With stunning speed, the &quot;family&quot; became a SocialDemocratic issue. When new elections were held in 1936, itwas that party that was able to posture as pro-motherhood,pro-child, pro-family and pro-birth. In a sweeping victory,the Social Democrats crushed the conservatives and ruled thecountry for 40 years, enacting policies that significantlyshifted responsibility for children from the family to thestate.   Might history repeat itself? The growing indifference ofthe GOP leadership toward the family issue has left the dooropen to a historic political realignment, signs of which arealready evident.   The Institute for American Values and the ProgressivePolicy Institute represent a new breed of Democraticthinking, with family at its core. In recent weeks, Rep. PatSchroeder (D., Colo.) crossed a symbolic line, endorsing abipartisan measure that would raise the personal income-taxexemption for each child to $3,500. Taking a more partisantack, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D., Tenn.) and Rep. Thomas Downey(D., N.Y.) are chief sponsors of a bill featuring arefundable $800-per-child tax credit. Meanwhile, VirginiaGov. Douglas Wilder is endorsing concepts long absent fromDemocratic brains: chastity and fidelity.   Word has it that the White House is undaunted. Indeed, itmay turn out that the president will counter theseinitiatives by being the one public figure opposed to new taxbreaks for kids. Wrapped in the mantle of The BudgetAgreement and wearing his OMB eyeshade, he will battle thesentimental spendthrifts in the name of fiscalresponsibility. After all, the Democrats are playing withmirrors, and the family will always be a Republican issue.   Perhaps so. Then again, Swedish conservatives once thoughtthat way, too.   ---   Mr. Carlson is president of the Rockford Institute, basedin Rockford, Ill., and author of &quot;The Swedish Experiment inFamily Politics&quot; (Transaction, 1990).</TEXT></DOC>
