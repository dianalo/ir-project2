Murray Handwerker, chairman and president, said the company received a $7.80-a-share offer for all its shares. A week ago, the company said it agreed to be acquired by Equi-Cor Group Ltd., a closely held investment group, for $7.50 a share, or about $17.2 million.    The company declined to identify the latest bidder. But an official said the offer is being studied by the company and its advisers, and a response is expected in the next few days.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Nathan's closed at $6.875, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
