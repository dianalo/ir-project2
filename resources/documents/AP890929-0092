(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Threatening weatherdelayed the launch of a private rocket to test Star Warsanti-missile sensors and a possible escape vehicle for spacestation astronauts.   The 58-foot-tall American Rocket Co. booster was scheduled forlaunch from this coastal military base Thursday at a time when thePentagon's Delta Star satellite woul be orbiting overhead in properposition for the Star Wars experiment.   But the $2 million launch and 15-minute suborbital flight werepostponed until Saturday because rain, clouds and fog created thepossibility the 33,400-pound rocket could be hit by lightning, saidGeorge Whittinghill, Amroc's marketing director.   Amroc, based in Camarillo, Calif., billed the planned launch asthe first in the nation using a rocket totally designed and builtwith private funds. There have been two other commercial launchesin the United States this year, but both used rockets built withgovernment money.   The Amroc booster is intended to release a cloud of inert gasfor a test of missile-detecting sensors aboard the Delta Starsatellite, which was launched from Florida in March.   Delta Star contains various sensors that some day may be used aspart of a Strategic Defense Initiative system _ nicknamed Star Wars_ in which satellites would detect incoming enemy nuclear warheadsso they could be destroyed, Defense Department spokesman Maj.William O'Connell said by phone from the Pentagon.   The Amroc rocket also was scheduled to deploy an engineeringtest model of an 8{-foot-wide ``ParaShield.'' It is a combined heatshield and parachute that someday might be part of an escape systemto allow space station astronauts to return to Earth, said DavidAkin, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology.   Akin's design class built the 390-pound model, which includes aParaShield and instruments to monitor its performance, after heassigned them to design a spacecraft that could be launched on anyexisting U.S. space boosters.</TEXT></DOC>
