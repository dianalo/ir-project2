The car has a new engine, front-wheel drive and sportierperformance, all designed to poach customers from flashierEuropean rivals. &quot;Customers who today drive Saabs, Audis,Mercedeses and BMWs -- as well as all U.S. players in the$25,000 to $40,000 range -- will be a perfect target,&quot; saidMats Ola Palm, marketing director at Volvo's car division.</LP><TEXT>   The goal, Mr. Palm added, is to boost Volvo's share of thelarge family-car segment to about 13% from 10% today. Amarket share gain of that size would boost annual output offull-size Volvo models to about 330,000 units from 280,000currently and assure a satisfactory return on the 16 billionSwedish kronor ($2.52 billion) spent to develop the 850.   Executives at Volvo, whose car operations have beenoperating in the red, were reluctant to discuss marketingstategies in much detail. The 850 will go on sale in Swedenthis fall -- and should reach selected markets in continentalEurope in early 1992. But the new car won't get to Volvo'stwo biggest markets -- the U.S. and Britain -- until fall1992.   When it begins its marketing push, the Swedish car makercan't afford to flaunt the 850's high-performance image toomuch for fear of offending its traditional customers, whowere more attracted to the company's carefully crafted imagefor safety. And as yesterday's low-key rollout of the 850underscored, safety and reliability will remain the marketingfocus.   Mr. Palm said the new 850 model will be priced at about$30,000 when it arrives in the U.S. The new car will nestlebetween the $40,000 top of the line Volvo 960 -- slated todebut in American showrooms this fall -- and the lesssumptous 940 model, priced at around $26,000. In contrast,the 25-year-old Volvo 200 series costs about $19,000 in theU.S. today.   Volvo Chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar stressed that volatilemarket conditions make prospects for the new car uncertain.And he predicted that the 850 -- which the company worked onfrom March 1986 until now -- will be the last new cardeveloped entirely by Volvo on its own.   &quot;The whole design of our alliance with France's Renault isto shorten cycle time and to be able to economize -- spendless for every developed car,&quot; Mr. Gyllenhammar said.Speeding development cycles, he added, is crucial in meetingcompetition from Japanese manufacturers now entering thefamily and luxury car segments.</TEXT></DOC>
