The activists, one a former army chaplain, remained in militarypolice custody on this southern Dutch air force base where the twoNF-5 fighter-bombers were waiting to be flown to Turkey, the planes'next owner.   The suspects were not identified in line with Dutch judicialpractice.   However, the Defense Ministry spokesman said one of them had beena Roman Catholic chaplain in the Dutch army before he quit in theearly 1980s to protest deployment by NATO of nuclear cruise missilesin the Netherlands.   Woensdrecht air force base, the missiles' planned deploymentsite, was the scene of numerous anti-nuclear demonstrations beforelast year's U.S.-Soviet pact eliminating all medium-range nuclearmissiles from both Eastern and Western Europe prevented cruisedeployment here.   Early Sunday, the two men gained entry to the base by cutting ahole in its perimeter fence, according to the spokesman, who spokein exchange for anonymity in line with ministry practice.   Armed with a sledgehammer and an ax, they did an estimated 50,000guilders ($25,000) damage before they were caught by a militarypolice patrol, according to the spokesman.   Dutch air force NF-5s, which have been replaced by supersonicF-16s, are scheduled for delivery to Turkey later this year. InNovember, activists daubed eight of them with paint here in aprotest against alleged human rights abuses in Turkey.</TEXT></DOC>
