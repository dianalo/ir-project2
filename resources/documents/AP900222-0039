It was surprising enough to find clumps of galaxies rather thana more uniform distribution over such a large scale, but ``to findthe regularity is just mind-boggling,'' said study co-author DavidKoo.   Gravity would not have enough time since the birth of theuniverse to produce the pattern over such a huge scale, so the findmay be a ``fossil imprint'' from the very early universe, he said.   But another scientist familiar with the study said he believesthe findings are merely a statistical fluke, rather than a realpattern.   ``This is so counter to our other notions (about the universe)that I'm going to treat it skeptically unless it's really provenconclusively,'' said Marc Davis of the University of California,Berkeley.   The new work is presented in today's issue of the Britishjournal Nature by Koo of the University of California, Santa Cruz,Alexander Szalay of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore andresearchers in England.   They surveyed galaxies in two opposite directions from the MilkyWay galaxy, which includes Earth.   Within these narrow lines of sight, researchers found about adozen clumps of galaxies separated by approximately evenly spacedgaps of 400 million to 800 million light-years, Koo said Wednesday.A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 5.88trillion miles.   The calculated distance between clumps depends on one'sassumptions about how fast the universe is expanding.   The gaps were not completely empty of galaxies. The Milky Way,for example, resides between two clumps in about the middle of theoverall series the researchers observed, Koo said.   Koo said researchers are now looking elsewhere to see if theregularity shows up again. If the pattern is proven, it would forcea revamping or abandonment of currently popular theories about thedevelopment of the universe, he said.   Davis agreed that the proven existence of such a pattern wouldrequire a ``fundamental rethinking'' of theories about the veryearly universe. ``It is totally outside the domain of any physicswe have thought of,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
