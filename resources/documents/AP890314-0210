It said the Boeing 707 apparently was flying at an altitude ofabout 2,000 feet instead of 3,000 feet when it crashed into thefog-covered Pico Alto mountain, killing all aboard.   The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications gavethis account of the overlapping messages:   The control tower authorized the pilot to descend to 3,000 feet,advised him which runway to use and asked him to renew contact whenthe plane was at 3,000 feet.   But at the same time the tower was sending the message the pilotwas radioing plans to descend to 2,000 feet.   Neither the pilot nor tower heard the other's message and the jetcontinued on its fatal course.   ``The plane hit ... in a zone where flying is not permitted belowan altitude of 3,000 feet,'' the report said.   The plane, owned by Independent Air Corp. of Smyrna, Tenn., wascarrying Italian tourists on their way to the Caribbean with a stopat the Azores island of Santa Maria when the accident occurred Feb.8.   The report said the investigating commission found no indicationof mechanical or technical failure of the plane and ruled outsabotage or other criminal action.   Traffic controllers at the tower did give the jet's crew anatmospheric pressure reading of 1,027 millibars instead of thecorrect 1,108.7 millibars, according to the report. It said thedifference in pressure readings would mean the jet's altimeters toldthe pilot he was 240 feet above his actual position.</TEXT></DOC>
