Interior Minister Tomas Borge called the gesture ``possibly thebeginning of the end of the war.''   Tearful family members embraced their loved ones who werereleased from the Zona Franca jail on the outskirts of Managua. Butamid the joy was an air of doubt.   ``They say I don't have anything to fear,'' said Feliz PedroChavaria Gomez, 32, holding a plastic sack containing hisbelongings. ``I'm happy, but I hope it doesn't fail.''   Chavaria said he was arrested in 1980 and charged with being acounter-revolutionary.   Cesar Augusto Flores Mireando, 25, was arrested more than twoyears ago in Managua. ``The majority of the peasants here areinnocent,'' he said.   The release of the prisoners was the first step in an amnestyplan the Sandinistas agreed to Wednesday when they signed acease-fire accord with leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels known asContras. The sides declared a truce March 21 and a a 60-daycease-fire is to begin April 1.   In another development, President Daniel Ortega suggested theUnited Nations send a multi-national peacekeeping force to theNicaraguan-Honduran border to stabilize the area.   Of the prisoners freed Sunday, 24 were workers arrested forjoining illegal strikes.   The release was ordered under an amnesty law the NationalAssembly approved by a margin of 82-2 Saturday night. The law couldresult in the release of about 3,300 political prisoners jailedsince the Sandinistas seized power in a 1979 revolution thatoverthrew right-wing President Anastasio Somoza.   Sandinistas hold 61 seats in the 96-member assembly.   According to the legislation, another undisclosed number ofContras taken prisoner during the six-year civil war will bereleased at an unspecified later date. The government also plans ageneral review of the cases of about 1,800 members of Somoza'snow-disbanded National Guard, Ortega said.   Speaking to reporters Saturday night, Ortega said the formerguardsmen all have been accused of human rights violations orcrimes against humanity _ such as the indiscriminate shooting ofcivilians _ during the one-year revolution that brought theSandinistas to power.   Many of them have been sentenced to the maximum penalty of 30years imprisonment, Ortega said. The downfall of Somoza, a rightistpro-American strongman, ended 42-years of iron-fisted rule by hisfamily, usually enforced by the National Guard.   Ortega said the case of each guardsmen will be sent to theOrganization of American States' InterAmerican Human RightsCommission for review before a release is ordered to safeguard theSandinista government from criticism that it acted unfairly.   On Saturday, Ortega said he had told Gilberto Schilittler, headof the U.N. delegation, that ``it is important to achieve thestabilization of the border zone with Honduras and this is onlypossible with a multilateral force.''   Ortega said that without a peacekeeping force, ``the UnitedStates can continue heating up the border ... provoking conflicts,increasing its presence to threaten Nicaragua.''   The U.N. team inspected the border Thursday and Friday, scene ofa reported incursion into Honduras by Sandinista army troopspursuing Contra rebels.   The Sandinistas pardoned and released 900 political and rebelprisoners in October and November as a goodwill gesture in anunsuccessful effort to bring the Contras to the bargaining table.   But in a surprise move, leaders of the Contra umbrellaorganization, the Nicaraguan Resistance, met with the Sandinistaslast week and agreed Thursday on a 60-day cease-fire beginningApril 1. Further negotiations will follow to reach a more permanenttruce.   An informal cease-fire both sides had agreed to while thenegotiations were in progress continued to hold Sunday.   An estimated 50,000 people have been killed or wounded since theContra war against the Sandinistas began in November 1981.   Ortega said the two sides will meet again on Monday in thelittle southern village of Sapoa, near the Costa Rican border, tocontinue talks.   The negotiations will now center on so-called ``truce areas''where the Contras can gather, and later turn in their weapons.   Sunday's amnesty was demanded by the Contras as a condition forfurther talks. It is also called for under a regional peace planthat Ortega and the four other Central American presidents signedlast August.   The plan aims at negotiating an end to the Contra war and toleftist guerrilla wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.   In Honduras, about 3,200 American troops, sent in two weeks agoby President Reagan when Sandinista troops allegedly enteredHonduras in pursuit of Contra rebels, prepared to return home onMonday.   The Reagan administration said they were sent both to bolsterthe Honduran government and as a warning to the Sandinistas againstfurther incursions.</TEXT></DOC>
