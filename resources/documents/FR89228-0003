The Atomic Energy Act of 1954requires that the NRC afford an interested person, upon request, a ``hearing,''in any proceeding for the granting, suspending, revoking, or amending ofan NRC license, including a license involving source, byproduct, and specialnuclear materials. The Commission previously has determined that the ``hearing''provided for a materials licensing proceeding need not encompass all theprocedures in NRC regulations that currently govern more formal adjudicationsfor the licensing of reactor facilities. Rather, the Commission has determinedthat, in most instances, an informal hearing with an opportunity to presentwritten views is sufficient to fulfill this requirement. The final ruleprescribes the procedures that would govern these informal proceedings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Paul Bollwerk, Senior Attorney,Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,DC 20555, Telephone: (301) 492-1634.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>On May 29, 1987 (52 FR 20089-20096), the Nuclear Regulatory Commissionpublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> proposed amendments to its Rules of Practice(10 CFR Part 2) that would specify the particular procedures applicableto informal adjudicatory hearings. In accordance with section 189a of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) (42 U.S.C. 2239(a)), informal hearingsare conducted upon the request of any person whose interest may be affectedby a nuclear materials licensing proceeding. <T3>Kerr-McGee Corp.</T3> (West Chicago Rate Earths Facility), CLI-82-2,15 NRC 232 (1982), <T3>aff'd sub nom. City of West Chicago v. NRC, </T3>701 F.2d 632 (7thCir. 1983) [both hereinafter referred to as <T3>West Chicago</T3>]. On July 24, 1987, the date for submitting commentson the proposed rule was extended to August 28, 1987 (52 FR 27821).As proposed, the informal hearing procedures differ substantially fromthe existing regulations in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G that govern the conductof NRC formal, trial-type adjudications. Specifically, the presiding officeris to receive and to make his or her determination based solely upon a``hearing file'' compiled by the NRC staff, which need not be a party tothe proceeding, and written presentations by the parties. There would beno discovery. Only if the presiding officer found that the written presentationswere insufficient to create an adequate record would oral presentationsbe permitted. Any examination of those making oral presentations wouldbe limited strictly by the presiding officer. The type of cross-examinationby the parties that generally is permitted in formal adjudications wouldbe prohibited. Essentially, the informal hearing is designed to elicitinformation and resolve issues primarily through inquiry by the presidingofficer rather than through an adversarial confrontation between the parties.As a consequence, the presiding officer has broad discretion in controllingthe manner in which the issues raised by the parties are to be explored.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Comments and Commission Responses</ITAG>The Commission received twelve letters of comment representing a broadspectrum of interested persons. Commenters included private corporationsthat hold NRC materials licenses, a trade association representing companiesholding NRC materials licenses, private counsel that represent NRC reactorand materials licensees, public interest groups, a local governmental entity,and an individual member of the public. Seven of the commenters expressedgeneral support for the proposed rules and provided specific comments andsuggestions on particular provisions. Three commenters opposed the rulesas providing insufficient procedural protections for intervening parties.Two other commenters opposed the rules as unnecessarily formalizing thehearing process for materials licensing adjudications. A review of thespecific comments and the Commission's responses to those comments follows.A. General Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Hearing Procedures Are Too Formal</ITAG>Several commenters who are materials licensees or who represent materialslicensees expressed concern that the proposed informal procedures wereunnecessary or too formal. One commenter suggested that, given the smallnumber of materials licensing hearing requests received by the Commissionover the past several years, the Commission need only continue its presentpractice. That practice, which has been in effect since the first informalhearing in the 1982 <T3>West Chicago</T3> proceeding, is to issue an order in response to eachmaterials licensing hearing request that establishes the procedures governingthat informal hearing. The Commission disagrees. Its practice of issuingindividual orders has allowed the agency to gain valuable practical experiencein conducting informal adjudications, experience that is reflected in theprovisions of this final rule. The small number of hearing requests explainsin part the delay in the Commission's promulgation of this final rule inthat it has taken longer to gain the relevant experience that has guidedit in formulating appropriate procedures. However, it ultimately is nota sufficient counterweight to the prudent observation of the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in its <T3>West Chicago</T3> decision, 701 F.2d at 645, that the interests ofall concerned in the hearing process are better served if the agency formulatesregulations that make it clear what procedures will apply to all informalproceedings. This is particularly so given the large number of materialslicensing actions the Commission takes each year that potentially are subjectto hearing requests.This commenter also asserted that the proposed informal procedures shouldnot be adopted because the adjudicatory format is not suited to the resolutionof technical questions and, in any vent, the existence of two sets of procedures,one for informal proceedings and one for formal proceedings, inevitablywill lead intervenors to complain that their allegations require the useof the more extensive formal procedures. Regarding the issue of the suitabilityof ``adjudicatory'' procedures, the commenter appears to be questioningthe advisability of using a trial-type, adversary format, as opposed tomore legislative-type, informal procedures, to resolve technical disputes.In its proposed rule, however, the Commission has sought to strike a necessarybalance between these two poles. Recognizing that interested persons withinthe meaning of AEA section 189a are statutorily afforded the status of``parties'' with an opportunity to participate in a hearing.\1\<NOTE/> the rules allow participation though written and, in limitedcircumstances, oral submissions by which a challenged licensing actioncan be supported or opposed. On the other hand, cognizant that these materialslicensing hearings need not adhere to the Administrative Procedure Act's(APA) adversary trial model set forth in the formal hearing provisionsof 5 U.S.C. 556-557, the Commission has attempted to enhance the role ofthe presiding officer as a technical fact finder by giving him or her theprimary responsibility for controlling the development of the hearing recordbeyond the initial submissions of the parties. Further, the Commissiondoes not believe that the mere existence of a set of informal procedureswill lead to an erosion of the distinction between formal and informalproceedings or lead to undue confusion about when the use of either typeof proceeding is appropriate. <T3>See generally Sequoyah Fuels Corp. </T3>(Sequoyah UF6 to UF4 Facility),CLI-86-17, 24 NRC 489 (1986) (Commission declines to accept presiding officer'ssuggestion to convert informal hearing to formal proceeding).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Because an interested person has a statutory right torequest and receive a hearing on those materials licensing actions specifiedin AEA section 189a, the Commission cannot, as one licensee appeared tosuggest, simply decline to convene any materials licensing hearings.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Hearing Procedures are Too Informal</ITAG>In contrast to the comments discussed above, several individuals and publicinterest groups asserted that the Commission's proposed informal procedureswere too ``informal.'' In particular, these commenters decried the failureof the rules to provide for discovery or for wide-ranging cross-examinationby parties to the proceeding.Parties generally have no right to discovery even in APA ``on the record''hearings, unless discovery procedures are authorized by agency regulations.Further, because the Commission is not required to conduct an APA ``onthe record'' hearing in a materials licensing case, the parties in thesecases have no right to cross-examination under the Commission's ``on therecord'' hearing procedures in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G. Nor does the Commissionbelieve these measures are necessary to afford the parties a full and fairhearing. Although there is no discovery, the proposed rules do providethat the NRC staff is to create and update a hearing file consisting ofthe materials relevant to the licensing proceeding, including the applicationand any amendments to the application, any environmental assessment orimpact statement, and any NRC report or correspondence between the NRCand the applicant relating to the application. In addition, if an oralpresentation is found by the presiding officer to be an appropriate aidto fact-finding, the presiding officer is given the authority to pose towitnesses questions that have been suggested by the parties. This is notthe type of cross-examination usually associated with formal adjudicatoryproceedings, as is described in more detail in the discussion that follows;nonetheless, it still provides the parties in the context of this moreinformal proceeding with an opportunity to raise questions with the presidingofficer about a witness' testimony.B. Comments Relating to Specific Provisions of the Proposed Rule <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed andSection; 2.1201_Scope of Proceeding</ITAG>One Commenter has raised two concerns about andSection; 2.1201 of the proposedrule, which describes those materials licensing actions for which informalhearings are provided. This commenter pointed out that in previous instancesinvolving a request under 10 CFR 20.302 for agency approval of proposedprocedures for the disposal of very low-level radioactive waste not coveredby 10 CFR Part 61, the Commission has authorized the use of informal hearingprocedures and suggested this does not appear to be covered by proposedandSection; 2.1201. An authorization under andSection; 20.302, which is notreferred to specifically in andSection; 2.1201, generally comes about asan amendment to an existing byproduct, source, or special nuclear materiallicense issued under Part 30, 40, or 70. As an amendment for authorizationto dispose of materials held under an existing materials licenses, ratherthan a request for a license to operate a waste disposal facility under10 CFR Part 61, this authorization clearly falls within andSection; 2.1201.The same would be true of various other Part 20 authorizations, which relateto a license issued under Part 30, 40, or 70. <T3>E.g., </T3>20.105(a). Accordingly, no specific reference is requiredin andSection; 2.1201 to cover these authorizations.This commenter also suggested this provision is too broad because it statesthat formal hearing procedures are applicable to those adjudications institutedin response to a notice of proposed action issued under 10 CFR 2.105(a)(7)for ``any other license or amendment as to which the Commission determinesthat an opportunity for a public hearing should be afforded.'' However,as the Commission's <T3>West Chicago </T3>decision makes clear, the notice of proposed hearingreferenced in andSection; 2.105(a)(7) is one that is issued when the Commissionhas determined the public interest requires a formal hearing. <T3>West Chicago, </T3>15 NRC at 244-46. Accordingly, the provision correctlyreflects that hearings commenced in response to a notice of proposed actionissued under andSection; 2.105(a)(7) will, in accordance with andSection; 2.700,be conducted under the formal hearing procedures of Subpart G.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proposed andSection; 2.1203_Docket, Filing, and Service</ITAG>Section 2.1203 establishes the administrative requirements for the docketand the filing and service of documents in each proceeding. One commenterrecommended that the rule set out requirements for documents in terms ofsize, signatures, numbers of copies, etc. A new paragraph (c) implementsthis suggestion. The provisions of andSection; 2.711 relating to the extensionand reduction of time limits are referenced in paragraph (d).This commenter also suggested that this section incorporate the requirementsof andSection; 2.712 relating to service of documents. The proposed andSection;2.1203(d), which leaves it up to the presiding officer in the first instanceto set any rules for service of documents, was intended to add to the informalityof the proceedings. After further consideration, however, the Commissionconcludes that establishing rules for routine matters such as documentservice contributes to the efficient conduct of the proceeding for boththe parties and the presiding officer. Accordingly, the Commission hasadded language to that paragraph, which is now designated as (e), referencingthe requirements of andSection; 2.712.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed andSection; 2.1205_Request for a Hearing; Petition for Leaveto Intervene</ITAG>This provision, which describes how a request for a hearing or a petitionto intervene is to be lodged and treated by the agency, was the subjectof a number of comments that are discussed below according to subject matter.<T3>a. Notice of materials licensing actions/timing of hearing requests.</T3>In the proposed rule, the Commission described its long-standing practiceof limiting <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice for the thousands of material licensingapplications it receives annually to those that are significant. For thoseapplications for which no <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice is published, proposed andSection; 2.1205(c)provided that a hearing petition would be considered timely if filed withinthirty days after the petitioner receives actual notice of a licensingaction or within one year after completion of the agency action, whicheveroccurs first. Section 2.1205(c) also declared any petition filed beyondthis period would be considered timely only upon a showing of exceptionalcircumstances. In response, several commenters asserted that the agency'snotice practice was improper and urged that <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice be given for each materials license applicationreceived. Other commenters, principally materials licensees or their legalcounsel, challenged the provisions allowing timely hearing petitions tobe filed up to one year after the licensing action and permitting subsequentpetitions upon an ``exceptional circumstances'' showing. Allowing up toone year to file a challenge leaves licensed activities under an unnecessarycloud, they assert. Instead, the period for filing should be shortenedto 120 days or less. Also, they contend, the exceptional circumstancesprovision should be deleted in favor of a provision that mandates thatafter the period for filing a petition expires the appropriate challengeto a licensing action is to file a petition for enforcement or other appropriaterelief under 10 CFR 2.206. The Commission continues to believe that its present practice regarding<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice for materials licensing applications comportswith all applicable legal requirements and, under the circumstances, isappropriate in terms of the allocation of agency resources. As noted inthe proposed rule, the Atomic Energy Act does not require that any noticebe given of a materials licensing action. Given the lack of any constitutionalright to a hearing in the usual materials licensing case, <T3>see West Chicago</T3> at 645, the Commission does not agree with theargument that there is a general constitutional right to notice of theopportunity for such a hearing.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ As explained below, notice is given of those particularmaterials licensing actions that are more significant. Further, the publication of notices for all materials licensing activitiescannot be justified as a judicious use of limited agency resources. Underpresent practice, notice is given of significant materials licensing actionsthrough a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice relating to the receipt of the applicationor to NRC environmental findings relating to the licensing request (e.g.,a negative declaration of the need to prepare an environmental impact statement).Also, those persons truly interested in a particular materials licensee'sactivities can keep abreast of pending matters by periodically contactingappropriate NRC headquarters or regional personnel for information concerningthe license. With these vehicles in place for providing the public withinformation concerning materials licensing actions, the Commission doesnot believe it is necessary or prudent to expend the substantial additionalagency resources that would be needed to publish notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for each of the approximately five thousand materialslicensing actions the agency takes on average every year. <T3>See NRC 1987 Annual Report </T3>at 73. In addition to the staff resourcesthat would be required to prepare the notices, the NRC staff estimatesthat it would cost in excess of one hundred thousand dollars annually simplyto pay the cost of publishing notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for all these actions. The Commission also findsthe alternative notice suggestion made by one commenter unacceptable. Similaror higher costs to the agency could be expected if the agency publishednotices in local newspapers. On the related question of the timing of a hearing request when there isno <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, the Commission agrees with the commentsthat a lesser period of time may be appropriate for accepting hearing requestsas timely. Balancing the interests of materials licensees in prompt closurefor potential licensing action challenges against the public interest inallowing a reasonable opportunity for ``interested persons'' to avail themselvesof their section 189a hearing right, we find that allowing an initial hearingrequest to be filed for a period of six months after a materials licensingaction not noticed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is appropriate. The Commission does not agree with the comment that any hearing requestor petition to intervene filed after the six-month period should be treatedonly as a petition under 10 CFR 2.206. In determining under what circumstancesthe agency will entertain a late-filed petition, consideration undoubtedlymust be given to the fact that the hearing provisions in the Atomic EnergyAct suggest a congressional policy fostering a degree of citizen participationin specified types of nuclear licensing proceedings. <T3>See Long Island Lighting Co. </T3>(Shoreham Nuclear Power Station,Unit 1), ALAB-743, 18 NRC 387, 396 n.37 (1983). On the other hand, it isapparent that whether to provide for further admission of late-filed petitionsand the terms under which they will be admitted ultimately is a mattercommitted to the agency's discretion. In most instances, materials licensing actions do not involve substantialhazards to public health and safety. After weighing the matter carefully,we have concluded that, in the context of materials licensing, considerationsof regulatory finality counsel that the Commission place a heavy burdenupon those who wish to institute a hearing proceeding more than six monthsafter the agency has approved the applicant's request for licensing action.Therefore, to avoid the litigation of stale claims, in lieu of the referencein andSection; 2.1205(c) to the grant of a late-filed initial hearing petitionon a showing of ``exceptional circumstances'' and the language of andSection;2.1205(k) that provided for the use of the formal hearing late-filed petitionfactors in andSection; 2.714(a)(1), the Commission has substituted new languagein andSection; 2.1205(k). The paragraph now states that to gain admissionof a late-filed request, whether an initial request or a petition to intervene,the requestor or intervenor will have the heavier burden of establishingthat (1) the delay in filing the hearing request or intervention petitionwas excusable; and (2) the grant of the hearing request or interventionpetition, which institutes a hearing proceeding to explore the efficacyof the agency's licensing action, will not cause undue prejudice or injuryto any participant to the proceeding, including the applicant and the NRCstaff if the staff chooses to be a party. Essentially, the paragraph requiresthat the requestor or petitioner demonstrate that the well-establisheddoctrine of ``laches'' would not bar the institution of a proceeding. Additionally,this provision has been revised to state that any untimely hearing requestor intervention petition that cannot overcome this laches bar will be referredfor disposition in accordance with 10 CFR 2.206. Also on the subject of notice, one commenter suggested that the Commissionclarify the meaning of andSection; 2.1205(c)(1) to make it clear that thefirst <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice relating to a materials licensing application,including a notice about activities under the National Environmental PolicyAct, triggers the thirty-day period within which a hearing request mustbe filed in order to be timely. The Commission has done so. The Commissionwould add that, in response to the suggestion of one commenter, it hasrevised the rule to state that for an initial <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice regarding a particular application orlicensing action, the notice must include a statement that the opportunityfor a hearing exists under the procedures set forth in Subpart L. In addition, this commenter requested that the provisions of andSection;2.1205(c)(2) concerning ``actual notice'' be changed to indicate that timelinessdeterminations will be based on whether the petitioner either knew or shouldhave known of the pending licensing application or action. A finding thatthe petitioner should have known would be based upon such factors as newspaperaccounts. The Commission declines to adopt this suggestion. If a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice has not been published, a determinationabout whether and when a petitioner otherwise had actual notice shouldbe based upon the petitioner's particular factual situation rather thanpresumptions about what other than <T4>Federal Register </T4>publication provides constructive notice, asthe commenter seems to contemplate. Moreover, to aid in making that determinationthe Commission has, as the same commenter suggested, provided in paragraph(d) to this section that the request for a hearing should detail the circumstancesthat establish, in accordance with paragraph (c), that the request is timely.With that information, as well as any answer from the applicant or theNRC staff (if it participates as a party), and any additional informationrequested from the participants, a presiding officer should be able tomake an informed determination about when a petitioner (which in the caseof partnership, corporation, or unincorporated association would includeits directors, officers, and any members duly authorized to represent it)had actual notice. We note that under andSection; 2.1205(j) the additionalrequirement of a showing of timeliness also would ordinarily apply to thoseseeking to intervene pursuant to a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice of hearing. These intervenors would ordinarilyhave to show that they did not have actual notice of the licensing actionprior to the notice of hearing.<T3>b. Standing. </T3>Paragraph (g) of proposed andSection; 2.1205 statesthat in determining whether a particular petitioner has standing to participatein an informal adjudication, the presiding officer is to consider whetherthe judicial standard for standing is met. The presiding officer's determinationis to be based upon the standards that are enunciated in andSection; 2.714for formal adjudications. The Commission indicated that the standing decisionshould be based upon an analysis of the particular material that was thesubject of the licensing action and not the ``fifty-mile radius'' rulethat had developed with respect to power reactor licensing proceedings.(52 FR at 20090). Several commenters agreed with the Commission's rejectionof the fifty-mile standard for materials licensing. One commenter wenton to suggest that instead the Commission should create a presumption thatanyone residing (and presumably working) outside of a five-mile radiusof the site where the nuclear materials in question are possessed doesnot have standing. The Commission rejects this suggestion. The standingof a petitioner in each case should be determined based upon the circumstancesof that case as they relate to the factors set forth in paragraph (g).<T3>c. Litigation subject matter. </T3>At the suggestion of a commenter,the Commission has added language to paragraph (g) indicating that in additionto making a standing determination with respect to granting a hearing petition,or, by reason of its incorporation in paragraph (j), an intervention petition,the presiding officer should rule upon whether the petitioner desires tolitigate matters that are germane to the proceeding and whether the hearingrequest is timely. Further in this regard, to clarify exactly what informationa petitioner must supply in its hearing or intervention request, the Commissionhas revised paragraph (d) to state that the petitioner must provide a concisestatement of the areas of concern the requestor desires to raise at thehearing. This statement of concerns need not be extensive, but it mustbe sufficient to establish that the issues the requester wants to raiseregarding the licensing action fall generally within the range of mattersthat properly are subject to challenge in such a proceeding. It shouldbe added that a similar requirement has been provided for those who wishto request nonparty participation status under andSection; 2.1211(b).<T3>d. Intervention. </T3>Section 2.1205(i) of the proposed rule statesthat if a request for a hearing was granted and no previous <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice has been published, a notice of hearingis to be put in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that, among other things, will indicate thatany additional hearing requests relating to the licensing proceeding shouldbe filed within thirty days. One commenter has suggested that this shouldbe changed simply to a reference to paragraph (c) of the same section,which provides for the filing of hearing requests, so as not to ``encourage''additional hearing demands. The Commission disagrees with this commentbecause it misconstrues the purpose of this provision. In instances whena <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice previously has not been issued relatingto a materials licensing action, once a hearing request regarding thataction has been received and granted, it is in the agency's interest toensure that only one proceeding need be conducted. The purpose of thisprovision is to provide constructive notice to all interested persons ofthe date by which any further hearing requests must be filed, thereby cuttingoff any intervenor's later assertion of timeliness based upon lack of actualnotice.Citing previous Licensing Board practice in individual informal proceedings,<T3>see, e.g., </T3>51 FR 8920; March 14, 1986, one commenter also suggestedthat the rules provide the presiding officer with the authority to requirethat a petition to intervene must include particular information on theintervenor's concerns about the materials licensing action, like that requiredby andSection; 2.1233 for the intervenor's written presentation. This typeof requirement likely is not practicable under the present regulatory scheme.Under the Licensing Board's practice (which the comments of this and othercommenters regarding the creation of a hearing file make it apparent theydisliked), the applicant was responsible for assembling a hearing fileand making it available to potential intervenors ``immediately'' upon thereceipt of the notice granting an initial hearing request. As the LicensingBoard's notices make clear, immediate action was necessary to allow additionalintervenors to file a detailed petition/initial written presentation withinthirty days. 51 FR at 8921, March 14, 1988. As is discussed <T3>infra, </T3>the present scheme gives the NRC staff the duty of compilingthe hearing file within thirty days of the grant of an initial hearingrequest, the same period of time within which any intervenor must filea petition. It would not be equitable to require an intervenor to fileits written presentation setting forth all its concerns without accessto the hearing file. Of course, the intervenor is required to identifythe areas of concern it wishes to raise in the proceeding, which will providethe presiding officer with the minimal information needed to ensure theintervenor desires to litigate issues germane to the licensing proceedingand therefore should be allowed to take the additional step of making afull written presentation under andSection; 2.1233.<T3>e. Staff licensing action during pendency of a hearing. </T3>In explainingits proposed rule, the Commission declared that after weighing the privateand governmental rights involved, it concluded it would not require thecompletion of any requested hearing before the NRC staff could take thelicensing action requested by the applicant. Section 2.1205(1) memorializesthis determination. Although one commenter questioned this conclusion,the Commission continues to believe that it has struck the appropriatebalance, particularly since a process has been provided in andSection; 2.1263whereby the staff's action can be stayed, if appropriate.Another commenter declared that the Commission should revise the languageof paragraph (1) to indicate that the staff, rather than ``need not'' delayin issuing the license, is obligated to proceed in the absence of a stay.The Commission declines to adopt this suggestion. The purpose of this provisionis to indicate that in the face of a hearing request it was permissiblefor the staff to proceed to act in a particular proceeding if, in its judgment,the action was appropriate. As indicated previously, the Commission certainlycontemplates that when the staff is able to reach a positive conclusionabout the safety and environmental consequences of a proposed licensingrequest, it will take action despite a pending hearing request. The determinationabout whether or not it is appropriate to proceed with a particular licensingaction prior to the conclusion of the proceeding before the presiding officeris left to the NRC staff, based on its technical and administrative judgment.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Proposed andSection; 2.1209_Presiding Officer's Powers</ITAG>One commenter questioned whether two of the powers afforded presiding officersby andSection;2.1209 are appropriate. The first of these is the power underparagraph (d) to certify issues to the Appeal Board. We have concludedit is, for the reasons discussed more fully <T3>infra. </T3>The other is the power to subpoena documents or witnessesafforded by paragraph (h). This is improper, the commenter declares, becauseit would invite discovery requests. The Commission does not agree. Thepurpose of this provision is to make it clear that the presiding officerhas the authority under AEA section 161c, 42 U.S.C. 2201(c), to issue asubpoena for documents or witnesses if, in the course of conducting theproceeding, he or she determines that the information is necessary forthe full and fair exploration of the issues involved and finds that theinformation will not be supplied voluntarily. The issuance of such an orderis solely within the power and discretion of the presiding officer. Therefore,contrary to the commenter's suggestion, there is no need for the proceduresthat govern subpoena requests as in formal hearings.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Proposed andSection; 2.1211_Nonparty Participation</ITAG>As in formal hearings, the Commission has provided for nonparty participationin informal adjudications by ``interested'' state and local governmentsand by limited appearance statements for interested groups and individuals.One commenter protested that the statement in andSection;2.1211(a) that ``[a]limited appearance statement is not to be considered part of the decisionalrecord'' is evidence of the undue restraints being placed upon public participationin informal adjudications compared to formal hearings. This language, however,is merely a restatement of the practice followed in formal proceedingswith respect to limited appearance statements.Other commenters suggested that paragraph (b) concerning participationby interested state and local governments be revised to include a standingrequirement and to mandate that these entities request permission to participatewithin thirty days of the grant of a hearing request. The Commission declinesto adopt the first suggestion. As in formal adjudications under andSection;2.715(c),there is no formal ``standing'' requirement for ``interested state'' participationin informal hearings; those state and local governmental entities thatcan demonstrate a cognizable interest in the licensing proceeding shouldbe allowed to participate under andSection;2.1211(b). <T3>See Exxon Nuclear Co. </T3>(Nuclear Fuel Recovery and Recycling Center),ALAB-447, 6 NRC 873 (1977).On the other hand, as Commission precedent relating to formal proceedingssuggests, interested governmental entities that do seek to come into aproceeding generally must comply with any rules relating to timely intervention.<T3>See Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. </T3>(Perry Nuclear Power Plant,Units 1 andamp; 2), CLI-86-20, 24 NRC 518 (1986). As a consequence, the Commissionhas added language to andSection;2.1211(b) declaring that in instances inwhich <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice has been given under andSection;2.1205(c)(1),a request for andSection;2.1211(b) participation must be filed within thirtydays of an order granting a request for a hearing. Alternatively, if nonotice has been issued, the request for participation must be filed withinthirty days of the notice of hearing issued under andSection;2.1205(i). Byadding these specific provisions relating to the time of andSection;2.1211(b)participation requests, the Commission intends to ensure that all andSection;2.1211(b)participants become involved in the proceeding from its inception, therebymaximizing their participation while minimizing the possibility for laterdelay.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Proposed andSection; 2.1231_Hearing File</ITAG>Unique to the informal proceeding is the hearing file that is requiredby andSection;2.1231. That file is to be compiled by the NRC staff and providedto the presiding officer, the applicant, and all parties and andSection;2.1211(b)participants to the proceeding. It is to consist of the application forlicensing action and any amendment to the application; any NRC safety,environmental, or other reports relating to the application; and any relevantcorrespondence between the NRC and the applicant. Commenters raised questionsabout how and when the file is to be made available to those involved inthe proceeding and about the protections that would be afforded to proprietaryand other sensitive information that documents in the file might contain.The Commission previously has addressed one commenter's observation thatproviding the NRC staff thirty days to prepare and make the file availablewill impinge on the existing Licensing Board practice of requiring a jointintervention petition/initial written presentation. See II.B.3.d. <T3>supra. </T3>The thirty-day period is retained, subject to adjustmentby the presiding officer as the circumstances of a particular case mayrequire.This commenter also questioned whether the requirement to make the hearingfile ``available'' to parties and andSection;2.1211(b) participants wouldmandate that the NRC staff serve the file upon them, with the attendantcosts in instances when the file is large. The proposed rule did envisionthat service of the file might be one way to make it available, dependingon the size of the file. As the commenter points out, another way wouldbe to make it available locally. To clarify what is meant by ``available,''we have revised paragraph (a) to make it clear that service upon the partiesand andSection;2.1211(b) participants and local availability are alternativemeans of fulfilling this requirement. Which method the NRC staff choosesundoubtedly will depend on the circumstances of the proceeding.This commenter also expressed strong reservations about the proposed rule'srequirement that the applicant would be responsible for making the filepublicly available locally. After careful consideration we have decidedto shift this responsibility to the NRC staff, with the understanding thatif this ``availability'' option is chosen, the file need be maintainedonly through the end of the licensing proceeding. And, if the staff choosesto use service as the means of making the file available to participantsin the proceeding, requests for the file by other members of the publicdo not require that arrangements for local availability must be made. Instead,these requests can be handled through the usual NRC process for makingpublic documents available.The matter of protecting proprietary and other sensitive information relatingto a licensing action was raised by another commenter. Although the plainlanguage of andSection;2.790 appears to cover this issue for materials licensingproceedings, to eliminate any ambiguity in this regard we have includeda reference to that provision in andSection;2.1203(a).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Proposed andSection; 2.1233_Written Presentations </ITAG>An important difference between the informal hearing provided for in SubpartL and the formal proceeding conducted under Subpart G is the written presentationoutlined in andSection; 2.1233. The Commission contemplates that in the vastmajority of cases these presentations and follow-up written questions,rather than an oral hearing before the presiding officer, will be the vehicleby which the parties and any andSection; 2.1211(b) participants are heardand the issues resolved.Commenter concerns about this provision centered on issues of timing, thatis, when will written presentations be required to be submitted. Section2.1233 as proposed stated that the timing and sequence of these presentationsis to be set by the presiding officer after any notice of hearing and afterthe NRC staff has made the hearing file available to the parties. One commentersuggests that the provision be reworded to make it clear that an orderestablishing the schedule for written submissions may be issued beforethe end of the thirty-day period that the staff has to make the hearingfile available. The commenter repeats its plea that this is necessary toallow for the continuation of the Licensing Board practice of having interventionpetitions include the information required for the initial written presentation.The Commission adopts the suggested wording change. As indicated previously,however, because the NRC staff rather than the applicant is now responsiblefor compiling and making available the hearing file, the Commission doubtsthat a joint intervention/written presentation filing will be appropriatein most instances. <T3>See </T3>II.B.3.d. <T3>supra. </T3>In this regard, the Commission has not adopted the suggestion of anothercommenter that the rule contain language setting specific time frames withinwhich an initial presentation and any reply thereto must be filed afterthe date the hearing file is made available. While the Commission endorsesthe concept that written presentations should be made as promptly as possible,the Commission continues to believe that the presiding officer will bein the best position to set a schedule based upon his or her review ofthe issues raised in each hearing petition. The Commission also cannotendorse this commenter's suggestion that language should be added thatwould direct that the submission of written presentations should not awaitthe completion of any NRC staff safety or environmental analysis that isbeing prepared relative to the licensing application. Again, this is anissue best left to the discretion of the presiding officer. The Commissionnotes, however, that because the NRC staff can take a licensing actionprior to the completion of a hearing on the application, any delay in thehearing that might be caused by awaiting a staff safety or environmentalevaluation would not necessarily translate into a delay in license issuance.Finally, one commenter suggested that specific language be added to paragraph(c) to indicate that applicants have the right to file a reply to the writtenpresentation of those parties who challenge the requested licensing action.While the right of an applicant, as a party to the proceeding, to filea written presentation is implicit in the language of paragraph (a), theCommission has added additional language to that paragraph clarifiyingany ambiguity. The sequence and timing of that submission remains in thediscretion of the presiding officer. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Proposed andSection; 2.1235_Oral presentations </ITAG>In the event that the written presentations afforded by andSection; 2.1233and the responses to written questions posed by the presiding officer proveto be inadequate to resolve the issues raised, the presiding officer isgiven the discretion to allow or require the parties to make oral presentations.These presentations may include the testimony of witnesses. Commentersexpressed concern that the language of andSection; 2.1235 did not make clearthe parameters under which oral presentations were to be allowed, particularlywith respect to examination of witnesses by nonsponsoring parties. To clarifythis matter, the Commission has included language in paragraph (a) statingthat the responsibility for the examination of all witnesses rests withthe presiding officer, who may allow parties to propose questions for thewitness that the presiding officer can pose if the questions are foundappropriate. The Commission recognizes that by requiring the presidingofficer to make determinations about the propriety of each question fora witness, an additional burden is being imposed that could involve delayin the proceeding while the parties compose and the presiding officer decidesthe propriety of questions for each witness. Nonetheless, because oralpresentations should be necessary only in those rare instances in whichthe written presentations leave unresolved issues that the presiding officerfinds can be decided only after having oral presentations, and becauseproposed questions undoubtedly can be prefiled in many instances, the Commissionexpects these procedural requirements to be manageable. One other commenter questioned whether the language in paragraph (b) statingthat ``[a]ll oral presentations * * *, unless the presiding officer ordersotherwise, must be public,'' is designed to give a presiding officer morelatitude to hold nonpublic informal hearings than is provided for formaladjudications under Subpart G. In fact, there was no intention that thisprovision be substantively different from andSection; 2.751, which governsformal hearings. To avoid any ambiguity, the Commission has added languageto paragraph (b) to make it clear that this section parallels andSection;2.751. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Proposed andSection; 2.1251_Initial decision </ITAG>Two commenters raised questions about andSection; 2.1251, which specifiesthat after completion of the informal written and, if necessary, oral presentations,a presiding officer must render an initial decision, unless the Commissionchooses to undertake that task itself by having the record certified toit. One commenter suggested that, as with andSection; 2.764, there shouldbe language making the initial decision immediately effective so as toauthorize the NRC staff to take the appropriate licensing action. Section2.1205(1), which authorizes the NRC staff to take a requested licensingaction without regard to any pending hearing request, undoubtedly willprovide the functional equivalent of an effectiveness provision in manyinstances. The possibility exists, however, that the staff will not yethave taken any action or, if the staff has acted, the presiding officer'sdetermination may include license conditions that were not imposed by thestaff. In these instances, it would be appropriate for the presiding officer'sdecision to become immediately effective so as to authorize the staff totake the appropriate licensing action promptly. Accordingly, the Commissionhas added paragraphs (e) and (f) to andSection; 2.1251 to indicate that thepresiding officer's decision will be immediately effective, subject toany stay that might be sought and granted in accordance with andSection;2.1263. A second commenter suggested that the time within which an initial decisionwill become final agency action, absent an appeal, should be thirty daysrather than the forty-five days specified in the proposed rule. The Commissionagrees with this proposal and paragraph (a) has been revised accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Proposed andSection;andSection; 2.1253-.1257_Agency Appellate Reviewof a Presiding Officer's Determination </ITAG>Under andSection;andSection; 2.1253-.1257 of the proposed rule, parties andandSection; 2.1211(b) participants to an informal adjudication would havean appeal as of right to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board,as they do under the existing practice for formal adjudications. Severalcommenters criticized this provision as bringing an unnecessary and overlyformal step into the informal hearing process. One commenter recommendedthat any review be limited to Commission-conducted sua sponte considerationof the presiding officer's decision to determine whether there were anyerrors that require correction.For those informal materials licensing hearing proceedings convened sincethe <T3>West Chicago</T3> proceeding, the only appellate review provided hasbeen a Commission sua sponte review of the presiding officer's decision,such as is suggested by the commenter. As a result of its experience inthose proceedings, the Commission has concluded that the interest of allparties is better served if the Appeal Board is given the initial opportunityto consider any arguments concerning errors in a presiding officer's legalor factual findings relating to a particular licensing action. The AppealBoard, whose principal function is the review of adjudicatory records informal licensing matters, generally is in as good a position as the Commissionto provide a thorough, prompt, initial appellate review of individual informaladjudicatory decisions, as well as interlocutory certified questions, therebyfreeing Commission resources for the consideration of broader policy mattersrelating to reactor facilities and materials licensees. As a result, theCommission has decided to retain Appeal Board initial review of presidingofficer decision, subject thereafter to sua sponte Commission review.C. Additional CommentsOne commenter made two additional suggestions. The commenter suggestedthat the materials licensing rule contain a provision regarding burdenof proof in the proceeding and a provision on motions procedures. The Commissionhas included a new andSection;2.1237 that would incorporate the appropriateprovisions of Subpart G relating to these matters.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion</ITAG>The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action describedin categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmentalimpact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared forthis final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Review</ITAG>This final rule contains no information collection requirements and thereforeis not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>The Atomic Energy Act affords interested persons the right to a hearingregarding a materials licensing proceeding. As the Commission previouslyindicated in its <T3>West Chicago</T3> decision, 15 NRC at 241, the use of informal proceduresinvolves less cost and delay for parties and the Commission than the useof formal, trial-type procedures, the only other procedural alternative.Also, procedures must be in place to allow for orderly conduct of thoseadjudications. Codifying the informal hearing procedures for materialslicensing proceedings in preferable to the only other alternative, whichis the present practice of establishing the procedures to be followed ona case-by-case basis. By codifying the procedures, the Commission willavoid the expenditure of time and resources necessary to prepare the individualorders that previously have been used to designate those procedures. Itthus is apparent that this final rule is the preferred alternative andthe cost entailed in its promulgation and application is necessary andappropriate. The foregoing discussion constitutes the regulatory analysisfor this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>The final rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantialnumber of small entities. Many materials licensees or intervenors fallwithin the definition of small businesses found in section 34 of the SmallBusiness Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, or the Small Business Size Standards set outin regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR Part121, or the NRC's size standards published December 9, 1985 (50 FR 50241).While the final rule would reduce the litigation cost burden upon licenseesor intervenors because of the informal nature of the hearing, the requirementthat they submit filings and documentary information detailing contestedlegal and factual issues is still required. Some cost reduction in comparisonto the cost of participating in a formal adjudicatory hearing can be anticipated,although it is problematic whether that reduction as a whole will be significant.Certainly, the use of informal procedures will not increase significantlythe burden upon licensees to respond to hearing requests. Thus, in accordancewith the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC certifiesthat this rule does not have a significant economic impact upon a substantialnumber of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis</ITAG>The final rule does not modify or add to systems, structure, components,or design of a facility; the design approval or manufacturing license fora nuclear reactor facility; or the procedures or organization requiredto design, construct, or operate a facility. Accordingly, no backfit analysispursuant to 10 CFR 50.109(c) is required for this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 2</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Antitrust, Byproduct material, Classifiedinformation, Environmental protection, Nuclear materials, Nuclear powerplants and reactors, Penalty, Sex discrimination, Source material, Specialnuclear material, Waste treatment and disposal.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting the followingamendments to 10 CFR Part 2:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2_RULES OF PRACTICE FOR DOMESTIC LICENSING PROCEEDINGS </ITAG>1.
