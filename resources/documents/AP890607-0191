Hungarian Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said the militaryattack on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last weekend hadshocked his nation.   Events in China have had special repercussions in Hungary, wheremany remember the Soviet military's violent suppression of the 1956revolt.   Hundreds, and possibly thousands, died when Chinese troops movedinto Beijing to crush the student movement.   Grosz said in a statement issued by the official news agency MTI:``The tragedy in China has shocked Hungarian Socialist Workers'Party members and Hungarian society as a whole.''   ``I firmly declare that we deeply condemn violence andfratricidal war. These methods have nothing to do with socialism.''   Later, several thousand young people, including Chinese students,staged a peaceful demonstration outside the Chinese Embassy and gavea petition the embassy's first secretary promised to pass to Beijing.   Poland's opposition said more than 2,000 people in the southerncity of Krakow demonstrated Wednesday against the Chinese crackdownand demanded a clear condemnation from the communist authorities. OnTuesday, official spokesman Zbyslaw Rykowksi said the governmentfelt ``deep concern.''   In Taipei, Taiwan, Communications Minister Chang Chien-pang saidtelephone service to 80 cities on the mainland will begin Saturdaythrough a switching center in Hong Kong, and mail service will startin a week.   Chang said this will not change Taiwan's policy of refusing tohave any official contacts with the mainland government because thetelecommunication and postal administrations of the rivalgovernments will not be directly linked.   The Nationalists in Taiwan were defeated in a civil war in Chinain 1949, but continue to claim they are the legitimate government ofall China. The Nationalists and Communists are technically still atwar.   Also on Wednesday, the Taiwan government-run Broadcasting Corp.of China began a 24-hour news broadcast to China on shortwavechannels. The station also established a hot line to receivetelephone calls from Chinese listeners.   In Miaoli, 75 miles southwest of Taipei, about 10,000 people helda rally and condemned the mainland government for the killings inBeijing.   In an interview by the mass-circulation Bild newspaper ofHamburg, West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl suggested the ideologygoverning China and other socialist nations is dying.   ``The call for freedom cannot be smashed forever under the weightof tanks,'' Kohl said. ``Those in power must sooner or laterrecognize that economic progress cannot be achieved without humanrights.''   Dieter Vogel, a spokesman for the West German Economics Ministry,said ``economic assistance will definitely be affected if it isdetermined that the reforms are dead.''   Vogel said West German companies in China may also take a hardlook at future investment policies.   A West German relief agency suspended new projects in China toprotest the Chinese government's decision to use force to quell thepopular protests.   Japan's Foreign Ministry had announced it halted aid projects andpostponed official visits, but said Wednesday this resulted from thechaos in China and did not reflect a ``policy decision.''   Japan is the largest contributor of aid to China. Assistance,most in the form of loans, totaled $6.1 billion as of 1987, thelatest figures available.   Tokyo's reluctance to criticize China mainly stems from itsunwillingness to antagonize its neighbors, who still harborresentment against Japan for its actions during World War II.   Soldiers in Beijing fired in a diplomatic compound on Wednesdayand the State Department ordered the evacuation of all diplomaticdependents and non-essential personnel. It also urged all otherAmericans in the country to leave immediately.   ``There's been no communication from the leadership. There's noindication who the leadership is,'' said White House Press SecretaryMarlin Fitzwater.   U.S. officials have mounted a wide-ranging effort _ using spysatellites, embassy intelligence and interviews with Americansleaving China _ in an attempt to determine what is going on in thestrife-torn nation.   In Seoul, South Korea, about 1,000 Chinese students chanting``democracy'' burned effigies of Chinese communist leaders. Manycarried Taiwanese flags and placards that read ``Sword shall perishby sword.''   About 350 Chinese and Filipinos marched to a Chinese consularoffice in Manila, where they laid wreaths and called for thedownfall of Chinese Premier Li Peng.   In England, about 1,000 students marched in Oxford, 50 milesnorthwest of London. The Oxford University Students Union said itwas sending 1,000 postcards to Prime Minister Margaret Thatchercalling for the withdrawal of Britain's ambassador from Beijing andtrade sanctions against China.   In Hong Kong, crowds of Chinese residents protested in trucks,taxis and marches, shouting for the resignation of Chinese leaders.Officials said the crowd could have been larger if organized rallieshad not been canceled after a riot during the night, when a mobtried to storm branches of mainland Chinese banks.   Organizers feared their rallies might trigger further violence,and urged demonstrators to remain at home or pray at churches forthe Beijing victims. Police said they had no estimate on the numberof protesters, but noted they were usually six abreast and stretcheddown several streets.</TEXT></DOC>
