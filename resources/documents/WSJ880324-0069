As expected, Messrs. Shultz and Shevardnadze were able during their 2 1/2 days of talks here to set a date for the two leaders' fourth summit meeting. But it remains doubtful that U.S. and Soviet negotiators can complete work on a strategic arms reduction treaty (START), which would reduce long-range nuclear missiles as much as 50%, in time for the two leaders to sign it at their Moscow meeting.    During a short appearance before White House reporters, Mr. Shevardnadze cited progress in talks regarding Afghanistan. But administration officials said the two sides failed to resolve the most important remaining obstacle to an agreement.    At United Nations-brokered talks aimed at ending the eight-year war, the U.S. has said it won't reduce supplies to the Afghan resistance unless the Soviets agree to symmetrical cuts in its deliveries to the Afghan regime. Moscow has offered only an informal agreement to reduce aid to the Kabul government as the situation &quot;normalizes.&quot;    &quot;Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been realized in a number of areas,&quot; said Messrs. Shultz and Shevardnadze in a joint statement last night. &quot;But much more needs to be done.&quot;    Despite the absence of breakthroughs, Messrs. Shultz and Shevardnadze agreed to a summit date that is in both their leaders' political interests. Mr. Reagan is eager for a Moscow summit to offset recent failures with Congress over civil rights legislation and Nicaragua and the embarrassment of having two top former aides indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal. Republicans also hope improving U.S.-Soviet relations and another summit will deprive the Democrats of an issue during this presidential election year.    And U.S. officials say Mr. Gorbachev, shaken by ethnic rioting in Armenia and Azerbaijan and fighting an uphill battle for economic renewal, hopes a summit could help him gain political momentum before a June party conference that will be critical to his efforts to consolidate power. Even without a strategic arms treaty, administration officials believe, an agreement with the U.S. on nuclear testing, withdrawal from Afghanistan and other potential issues would strengthen Mr. Gorbachev's hand.    Mr. Reagan plans to spend his entire visit to the Soviet Union in Moscow. The focus on the Soviet capital is designed to illustrate that the trip, like Mr. Gorbachev's trip to Washington last December, is a working visit rather than a social affair.    White House officials said Mr. Reagan will stop in Helsinki, Finland, on his way to Moscow, and in London on his return. The stop in the Finnish capital, where the Helsinki Accords on human rights were negotiated, is designed to emphasize Mr. Reagan's intention to raise human rights issues with Mr. Gorbachev. The London stop has been scheduled in the hope that Mr. Reagan can deliver a speech on the summit for broadcast throughout Western Europe.    The Soviets maintain that the primary obstacle to a strategic arms treaty has been U.S. insistence that sea-launched cruise missiles be excluded from any limits on long-range nuclear arms. The U.S. says compliance with limits on such weapons would be difficult to verify. Western strategists say the missiles are an irreplaceable part of the U.S. arsenal, and are needed even more following a superpower agreement last December that banned intermediate range missiles in Europe. That agreement still awaits congressional ratification.    Mr. Gorbachev told a visiting Senate delegation earlier this month that he wants to finish negotiating a START agreement even though he knows there isn't time for the Senate to ratify it before Mr. Reagan leaves office.    But winning Senate approval for such a pact is likely to prove difficult regardless of who is president. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, David Boren (D., Okla.), warned this week that the U.S. currently doesn't have the means to verify adequately compliance with a strategic arms pact that would allow the Soviets to field mobile land-based missiles and small sea-launched cruise missiles.    Sen. Boren also warned this week that the U.S. doesn't have enough spy satellites to monitor Soviet compliance with both the pending treaty on intermediate weapons and a new START agreement. Administration officials have said that improving means for verifying arms treaties could take years and add billions of dollars to a Pentagon budget already under pressure.    To break the impasse on Afghanistan, Mr. Shultz proposed during his talks with Mr. Shevardnadze that there be a moratorium on outside arms deliveries to the participants in the conflict beginning when the Soviets start pulling out and lasting until three months after the withdrawal is complete. He said the U.S. wouldn't back a settlement unless there is agreement on such a moratorium.    &quot;They didn't feel they could agree to that,&quot; said Mr. Shultz of the Soviets. &quot;Nevertheless, this proposal remains on the table.&quot;    An administration official said Mr. Shultz spent far less time than expected discussing the Iran-Iraq war with Mr. Shevardnadze. He said revelations regarding Iraq's use of chemical warfare in Kurdish border areas and Baghdad's missile attacks on Tehran have made it more difficult for Washington to press the Soviets to support a United Nations arms embargo against Iran.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater condemned Iraq's use of chemical weapons and said television broadcasts documenting the attack, which Iran says resulted in 5,000 casualties, &quot;were horrible, outrageous, disgusting and should serve as a reminder to all countries of why chemical warfare should be banned.&quot;    ---   Gerald F.
