IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/16/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> GENEVA, Switzerland  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries all but reached agreement on measures to boost oil prices by sharing production cuts.    With only Iraq dissenting, OPEC's 12 other members agreed to accept lower production quotas to achieve a 1.2-million-barrel-a-day cut in the cartel's total output to 15.8 million barrels a day.    Meanwhile, world oil prices rallied to their highest levels since early September as the major oil producers neared an accord.    Only quarrels embedded in the long Iran-Iraq war blocked a final accord as Iraq continued to resist official inclusion in any production control plan. &quot;There is absolutely no change and there will be no change in the Iraqi position . . . someone else will have to compromise,&quot; said a senior Iraqi delegate, Ramzi Salman.    But most delegates continued after five days of intense talks here to assert that OPEC will achieve its aim, despite Iraq's refusal to participate officially in an accord. Iran, however, has insisted that any agreement must include all OPEC members to have Iranian support.    Ministerial sources said King Fahd of Saudi Arabia was expected to appeal personally to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for his cooperation with OPEC's effort to boost oil prices by lowering production. Iraq's oil minister said Sunday that only his president could authorize cooperation with an OPEC production cut.    To await the result of these consultations, oil ministers put off their meeting until this afternoon. This clear miss of last Sunday's deadline has somewhat deflated last week's palpable optimism about reaching a quick solution.    But sources said they hoped the agreement would stick even without active Iraqi participation if Iraq tacitly stays with its current production level of 1.6 million barrels a day. This temporarily reduced level of Iraqi oil production is a result of closure for expansion work of a pipeline used to carry Iraqi crude through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea. Normal Iraqi production prior to the closing was as much as two million barrels a day. Many delegates here hope King Fahd can persuade Iraq's president to keep the production closer to the lower level.    Ministerial sources said Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Indonesia and Iran are leading the effort to force an agreement. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest exporter, is said to be intent on a resolution that will push prices closer to $18 a barrel from current levels of about $16 a barrel.    The sources said acting Saudi oil minister, Hisham Nazer, suggested to his colleagues that his first priority is a production cut. This was seen here as another compromise, by an important OPEC member, underlining the strong desire for an accord. Saudi Arabia previously insisted that OPEC also adopt a &quot;fixed price system&quot; that implies no sales of oil at less than $18 a barrel.    Iran, which is working closely with Saudi Arabia toward an accord, also indicated it would agree to a higher Iraqi quota of production, provided Iraq participates in the overall OPEC effort.    An overall production ceiling for the first quarter of next year of 15.8 million barrels a day, if it sticks, would be sure to boost oil prices, according to OPEC staff calculations. OPEC experts estimated that demand for the group's oil next quarter will be 18.6 million barrels a day. They assume that 1.4 million barrels a day of that will come from stocks held by oil companies. Saudi Arabia with other members' support, urged OPEC to reduce production at a level below actual demand. Thus OPEC hopes to starve oil markets by next March to prepare the ground for yet another price boost.    Delegates here said OPEC success so far in pushing prices to around $16 a barrel since August from levels as low as $8 to $10 a barrel in the summer, is a great incentive to keep going.    Inevitably it is accepted here that the ambitious effort will take time. &quot;It's OPEC. You can't change the style. We move slowly,&quot; said a chief minister who asked not to be identified. </TEXT></DOC>
