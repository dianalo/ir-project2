The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries held private meetings in their hotel rooms inlate morning and early afternoon. They took a break after lunch andplanned further discussions in late afteroon.   ``We are consulting with each other and hope to reach anagreement,'' said Qatar's minister, Abdul Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani.   He predicted a deal could be struck within the next two days.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto raised the possibility that all 13ministers would gather at cartel headquarters later in the day toresume their formal strategy session.   The ministers opened their mid-year conference on Monday, thenbroke up to bargain privately.   The talks have stalled over a Kuwaiti demand for a much largershare of any increase in cartel production in the last half of theyear. Other members, including influential Saudi Arabia, want theincrease shared proportionately among all the members.   ``A lot of work needs to be done,'' Iranian Oil MinisterGholamreza Aqazadeh said Tuesday. ``We need about one or two daysfor consultations,'' Aqazadeh said.   A delegate from one nation, who demanded anonymity, said, ``It'sa deadlock.''   The ministers seemed in agreement on lifting their production capto 19.5 million barrels a day, or at most 20 million barrels a day,in the last six months of the year. The ceiling in the January-Juneperiod is 18.5 million barrels a day.   The ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining theirbenchmark price of $18 a barrel. Saudi Arabia had recommendedgetting rid of the target price.   The cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 18.5million barrels a day for the January-June period, well under outputlevels at that time.   Cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond thecartel's $18 benchmark.   Prices have eased a bit recently as OPEC has turned up itsproduction. But the price of a basket of crudes monitored by thecartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of lateNovember.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Julydelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, hasbeen trading at more than $20 a 42-gallon barrel.   The International Energy Agency, meanwhile, reported that theOPEC nations lifted their crude production by 500,000 barrels a dayin May to 21 million barrels, the highest so far this year.   ``This was primarily the result of higher production in Kuwaitand Nigeria, partly offset by a small decline in Iranian andEcuadorian production,'' it said.   The slippage in Ecuador's output, it said, was due to a landslidethat damaged the country's main oil pipeline.   The agency's Monthly Oil Market Report predicted demand for thecartel's oil would rise in the second half of the year to about20.85 million barrels a day. The agency previously estimated demandfor the period at 20.4 million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
