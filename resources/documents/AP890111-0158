Observer Chief Defends Monitoring Procedure</HEAD><BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The commander of U.N. observers monitoringthe Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola said Wednesday he issatisfied he will be able to verify their departure independently,despite South Africa's reservations.   ``I think there will be no difficulties in carrying thisassignment out,'' Brazilian Gen. Pericles Ferreira Gomes toldreporters who asked about the abilities of his 10-nation team of 70military and 20 civilian observers.   Also in Luanda on Wednesday, Jesse Jackson said the United Stateshas a moral obligation to support the peace process it has mediatedin Angola, instead of destabilizing the government by backingright-wing rebels.   Ferreira Gomes said the success of his 27-month mission dependson the good will of the Angolan and Cuban governments, which are tosupply precise numbers of Cuban troops in the country.   South African Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha has expresseddoubts about relying on Angolan and Cuban figures.   On Dec. 22, the three countries signed a U.S.-brokered agreementfor the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, paving theway for the independence of the South African-controlled territoryof Namibia, also called South-West Africa.   Cuba first sent troops to Luanda in 1975 to support PresidentJose Eduardo dos Santos' Angolan Popular Liberation Movement in itsfight against South African-backed rebels of UNITA, the NationalUnion for the Total Independence of Angola.   UNITA, which has about 25,000 fighters, was not party toDecember's agreement and says it will continue attacking governmenttroops.   On Tuesday, a symbolic contingent of 450 Cubans departed by planefor Havana. U.N. observer Col. Arvid Geirulv of Norway said theywere followed Wednesday by 1,000 more troops on a Soviet ship.   Under the agreement, 3,000 Cuban troops are to have left by April1.   Ferreira Gomes said he was informed all 3,000 will be gone bySunday.   He said 50,000 was the ``basic figure'' for the number of Cubantroops to be withdrawn, but Angola and Cuba are to furnish exactfigures once the observer mission is officially established April 1.All the troops are to be out by mid-1991.   ``We don't have the information about with what regularity theCubans rotate their troops,'' he said, ``but we are certain theywill all be withdrawn.''   Asked about UNITA claims that some Cuban troops have been grantedAngolan citizenship to enable them to remain in the country, he saidhis mission was to verify numbers of troops withdrawn, notnationalities.   He said the unarmed observer force would check the number oftroops actually departing from four ports and one airport againstlists furnished by the Cubans and Angolans.   The general said Angola's government is committed to providingtransport to U.N. observers, who have a mandate to travel anywherein the country.   But land mines and the guerrilla presence makes road traveldifficult in most of this country 14 times the size of Portugal.   ``If we get information from whatever source that there are Cubantroops where they should not be, we are authorizied to send inverification teams,'' said Ferreira Gomes.   At a joint news conference Wednesday, U.S. civil rights leaderJackson and President dos Santos stressed the importance ofWashington establishing diplomatic relations with Angola as soon aspossible.   ``Only the United States, Israel and South Africa have notrecognized Angola since its independence from Portugal in 1975,''said Jackson. ``It's time for the U.S. to get up to date.''   In an interview later, he asked: ``How can we on the one handmediate the agreement between Angola, Cuba and South Africa, andthen on the other hand permit ourselves to arm UNITA and destabilizethe government?   ``There should be a joint venture with the U.S. and Africa ratherthan a misadventure with South Africa.''   Jackson was ending a five-nation African tour that includedGabon, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Zambia.</TEXT></DOC>
