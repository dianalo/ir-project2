Despite aggressiveresuscitation efforts, the infants died.''   An internal investigation into the deaths of two girls and a boyin the neonatal intensive care unit June 15-16 revealed thatpharmacy workers incorrectly prepared a solution used to flush anIV tube after medication is given, the hospital said.   ``The IV solution should have contained heparin, dextrose andwater,'' Goldsmith said. ``Instead, it contained heparin andpotassium.''   Three employees were initially suspended but one was clearedFriday by the hospital investigation. The two others, a pharmacistand a pharmacy technician, were fired, the hospital said. Theemployees' names were not released.   Goldsmith said the infants were very ill. All were born 13 to 15weeks premature and weighed less than 2{ pounds at the time ofdeath, the hospital said.   All three deaths were ruled accidental by the medical examiner,said spokesman Bill Gilbert. Immediate cause of death for all threewas hyperkalemia, or abnormally high potassium levels in the blood,he said.   The medical examiner's office identified the victims, all ofPhiladelphia, as Latoya Simmons, 1 month old; George Rodriguez, 3months; and Rayna Williams, 15 days old. Prematurity was listed asa contributing factor in the deaths.   Goldsmith said the hospital reviewed safety procedures and isstrictly monitoring compliance. He ordered mandatory in-servicetraining for all pharmacy workers and will bring in outside expertsto review safety procedures.   ``We are certain this was an isolated occurrence due to humanerror, and we want to make sure we're doing everything possible toprevent future accidents,'' Goldsmith said.   Goldsmith said hospital officials felt ``remorse'' about thedeaths.   ``We are distraught that we had a mistake made in ourpharmacy,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
