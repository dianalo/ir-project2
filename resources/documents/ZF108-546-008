Hooten, director of the Digital Image and Optical Disk Project atthe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), has helped topioneer imaging techniques that make faded historical documents clear andlegible.andM;&quot;It's like a mystery,&quot; Hooten said.andP;  &quot;The whole world is picking up on it.&quot;andM;For the past six years, Hooten has researched digital imaging and opticalstorage working with 230,000 images War military personnel files.andM;Unisys Corp. designed the Optical Digital Image Storage System (ODISS)laboratory for NARA.andM;&quot;I couldn't have asked for more supportive management,&quot; said Hooten, whoheads a research and evaluation staff of eight.andM;Before coming to Archives in 1983, Hooten was project manager for theInternal Revenue Service's Files Archival Image Storage and Retrieval System.andM;Hooten began his government career in 1970 as a part-time IRS tax examiner inAustin, Texas, while studying at the University of Texas.andM;After getting a bachelor's degree in business with a minor in computerscience, Hooten entered the IRS management training program and moved toWashington, where be became a systems analyst.andM;Hooten, 39, attributes his success to flexibility and persistence.andP;  &quot;Im abulldog,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I keep going at it with persistent enthusiasm.andP;  Ibelieve in it, but I take a very realistic approach.&quot;andM;Hooten said he has a reputation for being tough on vendors: &quot;My situation hasalways been a Ralph Nader-type thing.andP;  I haven't ever been allied with anyvendor.andP;  I make them prove things to me.&quot;andM;Results of ODISSandM;Last year, he wrote up the results of the ODISS project in a 400-page reportpresented to Don W. Wilson, archivist of the United States.andP;  although Hootendoes not yet know the future of ODISS, he keeps busy working on the opticalconversion of 20 million file cards from the State Department, MaritimeCommission, Chief of Naval Operations and other agencies.andM;Hooten also serves as an adviser to State.andP;  He recently went to Bonn andBerlin to discuss digital conversion and optical storage of the Four PowersDocuments, post-World War II records on the governing of Germany.andM;He has given presentations to more than 4,000 visitors of the ODISS lab.andO;&quot;People ask, 'Aren't you totally burned out?'andP;  But it's like doing a magictrick, especially with the image enhancement stuff,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I feel likeI'm on stage.andM;&quot;What's important is that the system is responsive to people.andP;  Even thoughyou've done a great job of converting all these documents, if people aren'tsatisfied with the end result, they won't use the system.&quot;andM;Hooten said he would like to experiment more with screen design to make ODISSaccess easier.andM;&quot;One of our recommendations is to expand our basic research to plug all theholes and design a real slick system,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It would be nice if we hadmoney to expand without cutting off arms and legs to do it.&quot;andM;Hooten chairs the nonerial publication board of the Association forInformation and Image Management and the Digital Image Application Group, auser group he helped found.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
