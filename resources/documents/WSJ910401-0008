Now that Mr. Pace is gone, theformer astronaut is massively rewriting the script.   The old guard's philosophy was that St. Louis-basedGeneral Dynamics would best survive the current defenseindustry downturn by, literally, sticking to its guns andcontinuing to invest in a wide range of Pentagon projectsuntil the current cycle turned.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Anders, however, isn't sure the downturn is ever goingto reverse, so he's determined to slim the company down, choppayroll and research budgets, and possibly push intonon-defense markets.   With the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, which formallyceased its existence as a military force yesterday, Mr.Anders says weapons makers can no longer count on fears of&quot;the Commies pouring through the Fulda Gap&quot; to help fuel anew arms buildup. To pretend otherwise -- as Mr. Andersbelieves some of his competitors are doing -- could spellruin.   &quot;It's like being a fighter pilot, and one of your enginesis on fire,&quot; says the 57-year-old executive, who flew AirForce jets until 1963 when he became an Apollo astronaut.&quot;You can't just wish it wasn't that way. You've got to shutthe thing down and try to land on one engine.&quot;   Whether General Dynamics will land safely is, at thispoint, anybody's guess.   Mr. Anders is determined to turn the company into anefficient cash generator, squeezing all the profitability itcan out of a $23 billion backlog. He is not terriblyconcerned with General Dynamics being one of the biggest guyson the block, saying instead that &quot;the company with thestrongest balance sheet will win.&quot; It is cash flow, not salesvolume, that &quot;allows you to control your own destiny.&quot;   So new projects will be undertaken only if they meet amore stringent set of &quot;hurdle rates,&quot; which forecast returnon investment. No longer will the company sink lots of moneyup front on research in the hope of getting it back duringproduction. &quot;Engineering uber alles,&quot; Mr. Anders says, is athing of the past.   Those managers who perform well under the new system willreap financial rewards. Those who don't may be gone.   With his new policies -- and through a tightly controlledpublic relations campaign -- Mr. Anders wants to reshapeGeneral Dynamics's image into that of a shareholder-drivenenterprise. He pledges to eliminate earnings surprises at acompany that registered more than $1.3 billion in chargeslast year and saw the A-12 attack plane canceled by thePentagon because of huge overruns and delays.   He even suggests that the nation's No. 2 defensecontractor could move into new commercial markets to helpmeet his goals.   At Textron Inc., the conglomerate where Mr. Anders hadworked, he was responsible not only for making helicopters,but golf carts, chain saws, fountain pens and watch bands. &quot;Ididn't want my friends in the defense industry to hear aboutthat,&quot; he says, &quot;but I learned a lot.&quot; Already, he is pumpingmore money into Cessna, General Dynamics's business-jetdivision, &quot;as opposed to some new military widget.&quot; And it'sno coincidence that James Mellor, who was tapped by Mr.Anders as General Dynamics's president and chief operatingofficer, once worked at a graphics equipment company.   Phil Friedman, of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., is one of severalaerospace analysts who recently upgraded General Dynamicsstock to a &quot;buy,&quot; calling Mr. Anders's approach potentially&quot;one of the most dramatic shifts we have seen in thisindustry in the past decade.&quot;   But others are skeptical that the strategy will succeed.All of General Dynamics's principal product lines -- the F-16fighter, M-1 tank and Trident submarine -- face cutbacks asthe U.S. military budget shrinks. And never before, cautionsFirst Boston Corp.'s Peter Aseritis, has a defense contractorbeen able to &quot;maintain profit margins, to say nothing ofshowing an improvement, during periods of decliningproduction.&quot;   There's also the risk that in trying to slim down, GeneralDynamics could find itself short of the expertise needed tocapture whatever new defense work does crop up. Mr. Andersplans this year to chop 30% out of the corporate researchbudget. Just last month, the company shut down its DefenseInitiatives Organization, which was formed three years ago toassist with technology development.   Overall capital expenditures are expected to tumble nearly50% in 1991, and Mr. Anders has slashed more than $1 billionfrom the company's three-year spending blueprint. That's&quot;obviously a risk,&quot; says Mr. Pace, who, while stressing thathe and the rest of the board fully support his successor,concedes that he himself wouldn't undertake such severe cutsright now. &quot;Theoretically, the company could lose out,&quot; headds.   Employment will likely shrivel to about 60,000 in themid-1990s from 92,000 today, a 35% reduction. &quot;The good newsis that we . . . know where we're going, we know why we'regoing, we've made our plans how to get there, and the triphas begun,&quot; Mr. Mellor told managers last week at thecompany's Fort Worth, Texas, fighter plant. &quot;The bad news isthat it's not going to be without some pain.&quot;   Indeed, the biggest threat to Mr. Anders's vision could beplummeting morale. &quot;He can't carpet bomb the wholeorganization,&quot; says Jerry Cantwell, General Dynamics'sdirector of business planning through 1984 and now a defenseanalyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.   Mr. Anders, whose mordant wit and free use of expletivesdistinguishes him from the more patrician Mr. Pace, alreadyhas forced out the head of the electronics operation in SanDiego, where an Army radio program was bleeding red ink. Thegeneral manager of the company's space systems division,which last quarter took a $300 million write-off on the Atlasrocket program, has been reassigned.   A few top managers have left General Dynamics on theirown, some apparently out of disdain for Mr. Anders's messageand style. But the new chairman isn't going to run thingsthrough &quot;a good-old-boy network, which is often the way it isin the defense industry,&quot; says George Farnsworth, who was Mr.Anders's boss when he worked at General Electric Co.'saerospace division.   Besides, Mr. Anders says, &quot;I've got more good people thanI need.&quot; Of the company's top 150 managers, he figures, up toa third &quot;won't make it,&quot; and eventually will be demoted orwill leave.   For those who stick around, Mr. Anders is convinced he hasfound the perfect way to motivate them: money. &quot;I can do itby leadership and by intellect,&quot; he says, &quot;but I also want toget them in the pocketbook.&quot;   Thus he is seeking to overhaul the way employees are paid,cuffing their compensation to the company's return oninvestment, return on equity, profit margins and stock price.It is a model based, in part, on lessons Mr. Anders learnedat Textron and GE, where he held a series of senior postsbeginning in the mid-1970s.   At the heart of the plan is an effort to have all GeneralDynamics workers become shareholders themselves. The nuts andbolts will, subject to shareholder approval, work like this:Where General Dynamics used to match 75 cents to the dollarin cash for the 60,000 salaried and hourly participants inthe company's savings plan, no matter what investment vehiclethey chose, it will now put up only 50 cents in company stockif employees move their money into, say, Treasury bills or amutual fund. However, if participants buy General Dynamicsstock with their contribution, they'll be matched dollar fordollar in stock.   The top 150 managers at the company, used to largebonuses, now have an opportunity to enhance their salariesonly if they meet certain stringent performance goals. Theplan requires them to then defer a percentage of thosebonuses until they retire, a wrinkle that should encouragethem to meet standards over the long term. The deferral willhave a higher compounded monthly interest rate if the companymeets its financial targets.   The top 25 executives have the most incentive. If GeneralDynamics's stock price climbs $10 over the $25.5625 it closedat on Feb. 15 and stays there for 10 trading days, each ofthose executives will get a payment equal to their basesalary. At the next $10 jump, they get two times their basesalary.   This excites Wall Street analysts like Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co.'s Judith Comeau, who is convinced that managers will beinterested as never before in keeping costs under control.When she released a research report last month, hinting atsome of the changes under way at General Dynamics, thecompany's stock climbed more than four points. It closedThursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at$33.50, up 75 cents.   If Mr. Anders's master plan works and he builds up a pileof cash as he expects, he says he doesn't yet have a specificplan how to spend it, whether it be on a share repurchase,fat dividend or acquisition. He says it could take two tofive years to decide. In the meantime, he'll work to get hismessage out and try to calm employees.   Not too much, though. &quot;They're all a little nervous,&quot; Mr.Anders says, adding, &quot;That's exactly where I want them.&quot;   ---                   Tightening The Belt                                                                                                                                 1991*    1990   1989     1988                                                                                                        Capital Expenditures   (in millions)          $170     $321    $419    $496 Company-sponsored Randamp;D     270      390     465     463 Number of Employees      92,000   98,100  102,200  102,800                                                                                                          *Estimates   Source: Company reports and interviews.</TEXT></DOC>
