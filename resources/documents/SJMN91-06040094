Unless you'veheard of him (and outside the Bay Area, who has?) it's not a name that rollsoff the tongue.;    2. At present it's a pretty exclusive neighborhood, andhis belonging there is questionable.;    2. He's not even dead.;    2. Even ifhe were -- God forbid -- dead, other problems remain, the most troubling ofwhich is:;    2. It wouldn't give credit where credit really is due.;     THENAME IDEA came from a Michael E. Fox, whom the Merc described as a &quot;McEneryloyalist and prominent beer distributor.&quot; Numerous local Important People,including Mayor Susan Hammer, rallied around the plan.;    &quot;In the lastdecade, San Jose has made a lot of history,&quot; Fox said. &quot;It's now time torecord it.&quot;;    I'm not as prominent in the beer world as Mr. Fox (althoughI'm pretty active in it), so maybe that's why I don't see the connectionbetween recording history and naming a building the size of Delaware after TomMcEnery.;    It's not that Big Mac wasn't a hugely important figure on thelandscape of downtown. In downtown, Big Mac was Godzilla.;    As a result, I'msure that if he were talking about it (which he apparently isn't), he'd say hewants what's best for downtown and the people of the city.;    And &quot;TomMcEnery Convention Center&quot; ain't it. Nelson Gray, at the convention centerthis weekend with 1,999 other members of the Lions, is not exactly from Mars.And he's never heard of McEnery, let alone pronounced the name.;    Thepractice of naming a tourist center after a strictly local hero is dubious,but not unprecedented. The least we can do, though, is make it easy on theconventioneers by giving them a name that's manageable. You don't want themgetting into a taxi, telling the driver, &quot;Take us to, uh, this 'McHenry'place,&quot; and ending up at Henry's Hi-Life.;    BUT THAT'S a smallconsideration. Look at some of the others, such as the issue of deadness.;   Deadness affects the naming game because it gives society time to developperspective. Today's hero isn't always tomorrow's. I'm not saying Big Mac hasto die first -- luckily, he's relatively young, so the city can pay him asimilar profound honor somewhere down the line, if it's still so inclined.;   But are we really sure today that we want the Tom McEnery Convention Centernext door to the Martin Luther King library?;    Maybe we can find another wayto honor Big Mac, to recognize the labor and love he invested in downtown.Let's name a big meeting room in the center after him. Or a nice downtownplaza.;    But if we really feel a need to slap a name on the conventioncenter, let's remember who actually made it happen. Big Mac didn't wave a wandand create the $143 million to build that thing.;    The money came fromredevelopment funds, which is just a fancy way of saying tax dollars. Sooneror later, the money came from the developers who built the buildings, thebusinesses that inhabited them, and the consumers who bought the products.;   In other words, the people of San Jose paid for the convention center.Literally and figuratively.;    So, there is a perfect name for the San JoseConvention Center. It's the one it has now.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Larry Slonaker column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910209  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  637  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 9, 199100040094,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
