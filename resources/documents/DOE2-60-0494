By assuming that stress relaxation is equivalentto creep under decreasing stress, the irradiation-induced creep ratecan be derived from tests in which small elastically constrained beamsare exposed to fast neutron irradiation. In-reactor creep rates for stressesbelow about 150 MPa have been observed to depend linearly on appliedstress, namele d{epsilon}/dt = C{sigma}phi, hence the stress relaxationbehaviour can be described by the relation {sigma}/{sigma}/sub 0/ = Dexp(-CEphit) where {sigma}/{sigma}/sub 0/ is the ratio of the unrelaxedstress (derived from the change in curvature of the unconstrained beam)to the initial stress to bend the beam to the shape of the jig, D describesan initial rapid stress drop, C is a material constant, E is Young'smodulus, phi is fast neutron flux and t is time. The authors review stressrelaxation test results that have been used to characterize the effectsof operating parameters (such as temperature, fast neutron flux and fluence)and microstructural properties (such as anisotropy, dislocation structure,grain shape, thermo-mechanical treatments and alloy content) on the in-reactorcreep behaviour of zirconium alloys. Correlations between stress relaxationand creep results are also presented with support the use of the relaxationtest for gathering in-reactor creep information.</TEXT></DOC>
