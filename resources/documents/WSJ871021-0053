In a significant softening of his position, Mr. Reagan said that he is &quot;willing to look at&quot; tax-increase proposals offered by lawmakers. And, for the first time in the current budget impasse, Mr. Reagan said he was prepared to personally enter negotiations with Congress on a deficit-reduction plan.    Mr. Reagan's new position, outlined in a late-afternoon statement to reporters at the White House, doesn't completely satisfy calls from lawmakers for a full-blown summit meeting to hammer out a deficit-reduction package. But the statement shows that the administration is going to begin working more actively to counter criticism that it has increased market jitters by failing to put the federal budget in order.    Mr. Reagan noted that he authorized yesterday the first set of automatic spending reductions required under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. &quot;However, I think it is preferable, if possible, that the executive and legislative branches reach agreement on a budget deficit reduction package,&quot; he said. &quot;Accordingly, I am directing that discussions be undertaken with the bipartisan leadership of Congress for that purpose.&quot;    Economists and analysts generally were optimistic about the deficit-cutting initiative. The president's statement &quot;is a step in the right direction,&quot; said David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources, a Lexington, Mass.-based economic consulting firm. &quot;It is a sign that he's a little more willing to compromise than he was a couple of weeks ago and that's encouraging. But agreeing to talk and reaching a compromise are two different things.&quot;    White House officials acknowledge that stepped-up negotiations with Congress, while they may calm jitters in the markets about the course of the federal deficit, also carry long-term risks. If the administration starts negotiating but fails to work out a compromise with Congress on the proper mix of spending cuts and revenue increases, the failure could deliver a psychological blow to the markets.    &quot;There's a cost if you get expectations up too high, but I don't think that's going to happen,&quot; said one senior administration official. The official acknowledged that the new flexibility indicated by Mr. Reagan &quot;is a case of the president doing something he's not anxious to do.&quot;    It isn't clear whether the administration will try to negotiate a deficit-reduction larger than the $23 billion required by the Gramm-Rudman law, or will merely try to work out a compromise plan to meet that target. In any event, some administration aides continue to fear that discussions of any tax increases might merely add to investor gloom.    But analysts and economists don't expect any measures that could reduce the deficits significantly, and market strategists didn't see much effect on the stock market of a tax initiative. &quot;No matter what Reagan does, the market's main concern is liquidity, rather than the economy,&quot; said William Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff Associates Inc., a New York money management firm.    Moreover, if President Reagan abandons his longtime opposition to tax increases, he is sure to draw fire from many of his admirers, including economist Milton Friedman.    Mr. Friedman long has criticized the theory that tax increases would help cut the deficit. &quot;What makes you think raising taxes would result in a meaningful reduction in the deficit?&quot; he asked rhetorically in a recent speech. &quot;Increasing taxes isn't a way of lowering the deficit. It's merely a way to give Congress more money to spend.&quot;    Higher taxes could sink the economy, warns Alan Reynolds, chief economist at Polyconomics Inc., a Morristown, N.J., consulting firm.&quot;You don't tax economies that are threatened with recession,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea that this market is anxious to be taxed doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense -- and the idea that taxes are the solution to the threat of a recession makes even less sense,&quot; Mr. Reynolds said. &quot;But it depends on the nature of the taxes. There are some taxes that are relatively harmless. So if they (congressmen) feel compelled to raise taxes in weak markets, I would suggest liquor and tobacco, gambling and firearms. You can raise $12 billion that way.&quot;    The president made his statement after a meeting with Treasury Secretary James Baker, Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr. Reagan, who previously has emphasized his unwillingness to raise taxes or compromise with Democrats on spending priorities, apparently was persuaded to adopt his more flexible position by the Treasury secretary and by his chief of staff.    Indeed, earlier in the day, the administration had taken a hard line against compromising on taxes or holding a budget summit. &quot;We're going to hold to our guns,&quot; Mr. Miller had said. &quot;The president has given us marching orders: no tax increase.&quot;    But throughout the day, clamoring increased on Capitol Hill for more presidential involvement to calm the markets. When it appeared the president wasn't planning to do anything, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole asserted: &quot;Someone has to provide the leadership. . . . In this country, there is only one person who can provide that leadership, and that is the president of the United States.&quot;    Congressional leaders from both parties praised the president for reversing field and agreeing to budget negotiations. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles (D., Fla.), who had introduced a resolution recommending an economic summit, called the president's statement &quot;very, very good news.&quot; Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) added: &quot;I am encouraged by what the president has proposed. It's time to stop pointing fingers and cool down the rhetoric.&quot;    Both Sen. Dole and Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, hinted that all types of deficit reductions would need to be considered, including tax increases.    Sen. Dole expressed confidence that the president's remarks &quot;will reassure American investors that we will deal with this problem (in a) bipartisan way, in a global way.&quot; But, he added, &quot;it's going to take hard choices, difficult votes.&quot;    Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee, who earlier in the day had telephoned Howard Baker to urge a summit, predicted that there would soon be &quot;a few people meeting in quiet sessions.&quot;    Despite the satisfaction on Capitol Hill, though, some off-the-cuff remarks Mr. Reagan made to reporters after reading his prepared statement illustrate that there won't necessarily be smooth sailing toward a budget agreement. Mr. Reagan indicated that he still places the blame for the deficit on the Democratic-led Congress. &quot;For virtually a half a century or more, they have controlled both houses of the Congress,&quot; he said. &quot;And for more than half a century, there has been, with only two single-year exceptions, a budget deficit.&quot;    And White House aides warned privately that the negotiations will run into trouble if lawmakers insist on cutting the deficit mostly by raising taxes.    In his statement, the president praised the Federal Reserve Board for providing new liquidity to investors and to major banks for lowering their prime rates. &quot;I believe that there remains room in the markets for a further decline in interest rates,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm pleased that the bond market is strong and the foreign exchange markets are stable.&quot;    Mr. Reagan restated the U.S. commitment to the Louvre accord, which sets a common policy on exchange rates and other economic matters among the seven big industrial countries. He observed that the U.S. and West Germany had reaffirmed their effort to coordinate economic policies to provide noninflationary growth and stable exchange rates. And he said that in a phone conversation yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru Takeshita &quot;stated that his top priority was to maintain stable economic relations with the United States.&quot;    &quot;There is nothing in what has happened here that should result in a recession,&quot; the president said. &quot;The economic fundamentals in this country remain sound, and our citizens should not panic. And I have great confidence in the future.&quot;    ---   Jeffrey H. Birnbaum contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
