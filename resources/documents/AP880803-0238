Hereis a report:</TEXT><BYLINE>By ABNER KATZMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In his campaign to shake up one ofthe world's most complete welfare states and make its citizenrymore responsible for themselves, Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers is hisown best advertisement.   The lithe field hockey aficionado has twice chased down andapprehended suspects trying to steal the radio from the Lubbersfamily car outside their residence.   The personal intervention by the immensely popular Lubbers gaveeditorial cartoonists a field day and exemplified the changes the49-year-old leader wants to work here.   Lubbers' center-right coalition, in power for almost six years,is putting the Netherlands through one of the most profound swingin government policy since the welfare state took root followingthe Depression era of privation and five years of harsh Nazi ruleduring World War II.   The prime minister commented in a recent interview with TheAssociated Press that the 14-percent Dutch unemployment rate cannotbe addressed ``just by giving money to people, and say `Okay, thereyou are, you have a decent life now because you have your money.' ''   ``There is more than money involved in the welfare state. Thewelfare state should be integrating people in the society,''Lubbers said as he sipped black coffee in his office, located in arestored 17th-century structure known to pundits as ``The LittleTower.''   The welfare state ethic is entrenched, but so is privateenterprise in this export-oriented nation of traders.   The government's efforts to cut government back are collidingwith a society in which virtually every institution dealing withpublic welfare or cultural enrichment _ from hospitals, child-carecenters and schools to theater groups, orchestras and museums _receives public subsidies, if not complete funding.   About 70 percent of the gross national product goes to pay forgovernment-provided services, from defense to health insurance,dike building to pensions, unemployment, disability, sick pay andchild-support benefits.   At the root of the system is what has come to be knownEurope-wide as ``Dutch liberalism.''   That Dutch social philosophy is less liberalism than a pragmaticpolicy of accomodation toward divergent lifestyles, ranging fromthe nation's vibrant gay subculture to its squatter communities.   The historic Dutch policy of tolerance drew immigrant groups whohave helped since the 15th century to build a trading giant.   Critics say that same tolerance has made the Netherlands a havenfor drug abusers and counter-culture groups who bleed societyfinancially.   But tolerance is a necessity in a densely-populated multiethnicnation of about 14.6 million that is about the size ofMassachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined.   Even major governmental policy decisions, such as thepotentially explosive decision to put new NATO cruise missileshere, are arrived at by ``consensus-building'' to avoid the imageof policy-making by decree.   When management and labor negotiate yearly industrial wagestandards, they refer to each other as ``social partners.'' TheDutch have had no industrywide strikes in two decades.   To foot the welfare state's bill, the Dutch citizen pays some ofthe world's highest taxes. The tax and benefits burden averagesabout 50 percent of the individual's salary, not including the 20percent sales tax levied on most goods and services.   A good part of the tax bite goes to support the unemployed, andthe government is trying to steer away from the philosophy that thegovernment dole is the only panacea for unemployment.   ``If I say my only objective in the welfare state is to banpoverty, you would find a society where too many people are out ofa job, although they are paid by the welfare system,'' Lubbers toldthe AP.   ``On the other hand, if you look only to the statistics of fullemployment, you can make a horrible mistake,'' he added. ``You canhave a society in which everybody has work, but there is no welfare.   ``We have to promote a climate in which citizens feel themselvesresponsible for certain aspects of their welfare ...'' Lubbers said.   In six years the Lubbers government has effectively frozen mostwelfare and unemployment benefits and eliminated other socialprograms entirely in an attempt to free up capital forjob-generating industrial development.   Its enlistment of industry in job-training and placement plansis part of its policy of lessening day-to-day dependency on thecentral government by farming out to private industry and communitygroups many government services, such as health care insurance andhousing financing.   In his first four years in office, Lubbers' government bailedout one of the country's largest shipyards; in the next two yearsit was sold off. Government ownership of KLM has gone from 54percent to 39.4 percent of the airline.   Critics say Lubbers is putting the health of the economy beforethe health of the man in the street in his attempt to cut aburdensome government deficit.   A 23 billion guilder ($11 billion) deficit is forecast thisyear, compared to a total Dutch budget of 168 billion guilders ($80billion).   This spring, the government decided on cuts for 1989 and 1990 ineducation, housing and social assistance programs such as refugeerelief. The cuts are almost certain to pass Parliament.   ``We have a welfare state, but for how long?'' said Paulus Plasof the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions, the nation's largest uniongroup with 900,000 members.   Said welfare administrator Berty Beltman, ``This is a group thatwill not make a revolution ... they are the powerless.''   The Lubbers government says that by trying to integrate anunemployed individual into society it is preserving the bestelements of the welfare state without draining the rest of theeconomy to pay for it.   That sense of accomodation is also apparent in the Dutchapproach to international issues.   The moralistic tradition of Dutch Calvinism has spawned a socialand political consciousness that leads the government as well asthe well-informed Dutch populace to take stands on all majorpolitical issues.   There are strong anti-nuclear, anti-apartheid, Kurdish andpro-Palestinian movements here. Amsterdam is home to the BukovskyFoundation, one of West's most active groups monitoring Sovietdissidents.   But the Dutch are staunch members of the Western Alliance andfrequently adopt foreign policy positions close to those of theU.S. government.   In his first term, Lubbers took on an issue that was perceivedas a loaded gun pointed at his government _ the proposal to put newcruise missiles in the Netherlands. Recognizing the grassrootssentiment against nuclear weapons, Lubbers moved the issue throughParliament slowly, refusing to be pushed and allowing all sides tohave a say.   The siting idea was approved in November 1985 and Lubbers'coalition handily won the 1986 election. Then President Reagan andSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to eliminateintermediate-range nuclear weapons, and the Dutch breathed acollective sigh of relief.   Looking back on that treaty, Lubbers recalled that a reporterhad asked who he thought was the Man of the Year.   ``He expected me to say Gorbachev. But I said (U.S. Secretary ofState George) Shultz, of course.   ``I think Shultz was the most important participant in theprocess. He had very good timing, his substance and politicaljudgment was very good.''   Or to put it another way, he could probably handle Dutch-styleaccomodation and consensus-building.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 7</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
