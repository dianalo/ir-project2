(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A suspended judge says he'll fight hisbribery and corruption convictions for seeking money from anemployee, an attorney and a bank in the course of official business.   Former Cambria County Judge Joseph K. O'Kicki said he wouldappeal Saturday night's jury verdict: ``I expect eventually thejustice system will allow truth to prevail.''   Prosecutors alleged that greed motivated the 59-year-old judgeto rule like a monarch in the elegant 19th century courthouse inthe foothills of the southern Allegheny Mountains.   He was convicted of bribery in asking for $500 from a courtemployee for a job promotion never given, for demanding a favorableloan from a bank with a guardianship case before him and for askingan attorney for a ``commission'' after a generous award to thelawyer's clients. He also was found guilty of official oppression,a general charge incorporating elements of the other allegedviolations.   O'Kicki was acquitted of open lewdness for allegedly calling twoformer secretaries into his office while wearing only his underwear.   He also was acquitted on a charge that he bribed a Johnstownstrip mining company, gave an unemployed coal miner insideinformation in a money-making scheme and used court employees to dopersonal chores for him.   O'Kicki could be sentenced to a maximum of 26 years in prisonand fined $57,500. A sentencing hearing has yet to be scheduled.   He will lose his job, $80,000 salary and pension uponsentencing, the prosecutor said.   Jurors returned the verdict after 16{ hours of deliberationsover two days, following a seven-week trial in Northampton CountyCourt.   Defense attorney Richard Galloway argued for a mistrial becauseone juror appeared to disagree with the others when they were askedto stand individually and give their verdict on each count. ButJudge Richard Grifo denied the motion, saying he hadn't heard anydisagreement, and the Galloway promised to appeal.   As the jury was polled, James C. Miller appeared to say, ``Notguilty'' three times on the six guilty counts. He also apparentlyreplied ``guilty'' to one of the counts of which O'Kicki was foundinnocent.   ``I think there's no question the verdict is non-unanimous andcan't stand,'' Galloway said.   Reached by telephone, Miller said he agreed with the otherjurors.   ``I absolutely did,'' he said.   Jury foreman Francis A. Bazyk said the jurors had been unanimousbefore going into the courtroom. ``He was just overcome bynervousness,'' Bazyk said of Miller.   O'Kicki faces 16 other charges in a second trial focusing on hisprivate business dealings. That trial hasn't been scheduled.   In his testimony during the seven-week trial, O'Kicki said hewas joking with attorney Richard J. Green Jr. about the commission.   The judge claimed he had been persecuted by the state after hedrew the ire of Johnstown millionaire W.E. Schonek, a politicalpower broker and Lt. Gov. Mark Singel's father-in-law.   O'Kicki said the millionaire was angry at him for encouragingSchonek's brother, Rudolph, to make a stock gift worth more than$200,000 to St. Francis College in Loretto.   Schonek and Singel denied any involvement with the investigation.   O'Kicki, elected to the bench in 1971, was suspended by thestate Supreme Court in June 1988 and was indicted in March.</TEXT></DOC>
