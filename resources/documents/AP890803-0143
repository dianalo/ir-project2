(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two of the frostiest spots inthe country are trying to resolve their two-year battle over whichcan call itself ``Icebox of the Nation.''   Fraser, Colo., a mountain hamlet of 730, holds the federalcopyright to the nickname, but International Falls, a town on theCanadian border with 5,500 residents, has challenged the claim intwo cases before the U.S. Department of Commerce Patent andTrademark Office.   International Falls wants the nickname to itself so it canpromote its cold-weather product testing, which means more than$300,000 a year to the local economy. The city also has beendesignated as the site of Minnesota's cold-weather resource center.   International Falls has a mean temperature in January of onlyslightly above zero, about 11 degrees colder than Fraser. But theyear-round average is colder in Fraser.   International Falls has decided to offer $2,000 if Fraser willconfine its use of the frosty title to Colorado.   The offer is undergoing legal review, so hadn't formally beenmade by Thursday, but Fraser town manager Clay Brown said Wednesdaythat the offer probably would be considered seriously.   The City Council here voted 5-2 Monday to pay the $2,000 to helpoffset Fraser's court costs after discovering that it could costInternational Falls $20,000 to keep up the legal battle.</TEXT><DATELINE>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Reading her mother's law books at age8 has paid off for newly appointed District Judge Sherrie Krauser,who was sworn in Thursday to the bench from which her motherrecently retired.   Although Senior Judge Bess Lavine retired in April, she returnsfrequently as a substitute judge, making her and Krauser thenation's first mother-daughter team ruling from a bench, accordingto the National Association of Women Judges.   Lavine, 61, was the first woman to hold countywide office inPrince George's County when she was elected a probate judge in1954. She's been on the district court bench for 11 years. Her38-year-old daughter's resume also speaks for itself: high schoolgraduation at 16, law school graduation at 22.   ``Sherrie was always very precocious,'' said Lavine, whosehusband and son are lawyers. ``I knew she was fated when I camehome from work one day and found her reading my law book on damageswhen she was 8 years old. I said to her, `Sherrie, do youunderstand this?' And she said, `Yes, it's very interesting.'''   District Court judges usually hear cases dealing with trafficoffenses, domestic troubles, landlord-tenant problems and smallclaims.</TEXT><DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A highway repair contractor provedthat cold cash is a good incentive, finishing in less than 16 daysa highway repaving project that usually takes three months.   Motorists are getting back the busy, seven-mile stretch ofInterstate 96 west of here more quickly than they had anticipated,but they're paying for it. The state Department of Transportationagreed to pay the contractor a $500-an-hour bonus for each hour bywhich it beat the 24-day deadline.   The project began July 17 and was completed Wednesday after 375hours _ or 15 days, 15 hours.   The contractor, Thompson-McCully Co. of Belleville, will receivea $100,000 bonus _ the limit set by the DOT _ on top of thecontract price of $1.4 million.   It was the first such cash incentive project offered by thestate, and it isn't likely to be the last.   ``With the success of this project, we'll be looking at futurework to see where similar accelerated procedures can be used,''William J. MacCreery, DOT deputy director for highways, said in arelease.   Crews worked from about 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. six or seven days aweek to get the job done with the minimum traffic disruption on thefour-lane highway, which carries an average of 24,000 vehicles aday.   ``They earned it,'' said Rod Wyns, DOT supervising engineer forthe project. ``Our people and theirs worked 70 to 80 hours a weekto get the job done, and get it done right.''   The contractor said it was unsure how much of the $100,000 bonuswould go toward employees' overtime.</TEXT></DOC>
