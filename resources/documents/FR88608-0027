That revision,in combination with a parallel revision of the hazardous materials transportationregulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), brought UnitedStates domestic transport safety regulations at the Federal level in accordwith relevant portions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)design and performance requirements to the extent considered feasible.This action made U.S. regulations compatible with the domestic regulationsof most of the international community. In 1980, 1982, and November 1983, the IAEA assembled revision panels todraft changes for the scheduled 1984 revision of its transportation regulations.The revision was eventually issued in early 1985. The revision panels,which consisted of representatives of most major countries involved innuclear material transportation, made IAEA regulations more compatiblewith U.S. regulations through some of their decisions. When NRC and DOTwere finalizing their transportation regulations in 1983, they anticipatedsome of the changes that IAEA was making in the revision of its regulations.The 1983 NRC and DOT rules were written to incorporate, to the extent possible,some of the IAEA changes. Where it was not possible to incorporate IAEAchanges, the 1983 rules were written so as to minimize the number of changesthat would have to be made when the IAEA revision was completed. Thosechanges and other changes, not anticipated by NRC and DOT in 1983, arebeing incorporated into this proposed rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Major Changes </ITAG>The major proposed changes to 10 CFR Part 71 are additional accident testrequirements for certain packages, an expansion in the number of radionuclideswith listed limits for the quantity of radioactive material in a singlepackage, a number of changes in the listed limits, simplification of thefissile material transport classes, updating requirements for shipmentof low-specific-activity materials and inclusion of the criteria for airtransport of plutonium. These major changes are discussed in the followingparagraphs.Additional Accident Test Requirements A deep water immersion test has been added to the regulations for a TypeB package containing irradiated nuclear fuel in excess of 10\6\Ci (37PBq).If such a package were lost in relatively shallow coastal waters due tothe sinking or capsizing of a ship or barge, the probability is high thatan attempt would be made to recover the package and its contents. The deepimmersion test (200 m) requirement, which can be satisfied through engineeringevaluation or actual physical test (andSection; 71.41), is to assure thatthe package containment system does not rupture from the water pressureat 200 m (656 ft) which would create radiological problems for the recoveryoperation or an additional environmental risk. While the NRC staff believes that many existing Type B cask designs nowapproved by NRC will satisfy this additional test without need for modification,adding the test to the regulations will assure that foreign casks and futureU.S. designs will also have the ability to survive deep immersion in water.Adding the deep immersion test to the regulations also introduces the costinvolved in having licensees analyze existing package designs to assureand demonstrate that presently approved casks for transporting irradiatednuclear fuel satisfy the requirement. These costs can be avoided if noadditional casks of the same design will be fabricated beyond a specifieddate, and if the casks will not be used for international transport beyonda specified date. In that case, existing casks of the approved design cancontinue to be used domestically with no further qualification regardingdeep immersion. A dynamic crush test has been added to the Type B package rules in additionto the 9 m (30 ft) drop test for packages which are minimally vulnerableto damage in the drop test, but which have a high potential for radiationhazard if package failure occurs. The crush test requirement, which canalso be satisfied through provisions of 71.41, is applied to packages whichare both lightweight, up to 500 kg (1100 lb) and low density (up to 1,000kg/m\3\, i.e., 1 g/cm\3\), and which have a high radioactive material content(over 1000 A<T2>2</T2>) in normal form. The dynamic crush test consists of the dropof a 500 kg (1,100 lb) mild steel plate from 9 m onto the package restingon an unyielding support. IAEA applies the crush test in place of the 9m drop test for the lightweight packages specified. In the absence of experienceusing the crush test, and because the crush test and drop test evaluatedifferent features of a package, NRC is requiring both the crush test andthe 9 m drop test for lightweight packages. There are a limited number of lightweight, low density, and high radioactivematerial content package designs to which the crush test would apply. Ofthose, some would pass the crush test so that no package design modificationwould be necessary. A limited amount of analysis would suffice to requalifythe package design to the new standards. If the package design is not usedinternationally, and no further packages will be fabricated after a specificdate, no effort to satisfy the new crush test standard would be necessary,and existing packages could be used in domestic transportation to the endof their useful lives. Changes in Radionuclide Limits The preamble to the August 5, 1983 revision of 10 CFR Part 71 (48 FR 35600)noted that the IAEA, as part of its effort to maintain the continued adequacyof the regulations, had adopted a modified system for determining A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values. The A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values are the maximum quantity of a particular radionuclidepermitted in Type A packages in special form and normal form, respectively.Type A packages are those which provide adequate containment, shielding,and criticality control under normal conditions of transport and minoraccidents, but are not designed to survive severe transportation accidents.Instead, there are limits placed on Type A package radioactive materialcontents. Accident resistant packages are identified as Type B. Radioactivematerial in special form is either a nondispersible solid or sealed ina capsule so that the dispersibility, and therefore the radiological hazard,of the radioactive material is diminished. This system of limiting theradioactive content of Type A packages to A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values depending on the dispersibility of the contents is theregulatory scheme for limiting the potential radiological hazard of a serioustransportation accident involving packages of radioactive material. The IAEA's modified system for determining A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values is based on achieving essentially the same limitationson potential accident radiological hazards as its predecessor system. However,the new system has the following advantages: 1. It states the radiation protection criteria employed more clearly; 2. It incorporates the data and conclusions on metabolic pathways providedover the years 1977-1981 by the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection (ICRP); 3. It includes dosimetric routes not previously considered; and 4. It harmonizes IAEA regulations with ICRP recommendations on radiologicalsafety in Publications ICRP-26 and ICRP-30.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ICRP publications are available for sale at Pergamon Press,Inc., Maxwell House, Fairview Park, Elmsford, NY 10523.  The effect of IAEA's adoption of this new system for calculating A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values, and the subsequent incorporation of the new values inU.S. domestic regulations, is that most current A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values are changing in this revision. Of the 284 radionuclideentries in 10 CFR Part 71, A<T2>2</T2> values are being raised in 129 cases and lowered in 95 cases.Of the A<T2>1</T2> values, 144 are being raised and 73 are being lowered. Basedon our most current knowledge of radioactive material shipments in theUnited States,\2\<NOTE/> the economic impacts of these changes are not likely to belarge. However, any situations where a potential exists for significanteconomic impacts as a result of changes in the A<T2>1</T2> or A<T2>2</T2> values should be brought to the Commission's attention in publiccomments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Transport of Radioactive Material in the United States,SRI International, SAND84-7174, April 1985, is available from the NationalTechnical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port RoyalRoad, Springfield, VA 22161. The new IAEA system for calculating A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values is described in Appendix I, ``The Q System for the Calculationof A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> Values,'' of IAEA Safety Series No. 7, ``Explanatory Materialfor the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material(1985 Edition).'' Single copies of Appendix I are available free of chargefrom the contact for this rulemaking. Expansion of Radionuclide List Based on numerous proposals for additions to the table of radionuclidesin which limits are listed for the quantity of radioactive material ina single package, IAEA concluded that its table needed to include all radionuclideswhich have the potential for transportation. As a result, Table A-1 inPart 71, which provides A<T2>1</T2> and A<T2>2</T2> values, has been expanded from 284 entries to 378 entries. Becausethere now should be few instances where unlisted radionuclides would betransported, the rules for calculating values for unlisted radionuclideshave been simplified. The determination of limits for unlisted radionuclides,except for very conservative values, will be made subject to Commissionapproval. Simplification of Fissile Material Classes As a result of the evolution of the fissile material criteria, IAEA recognizedthat the current three fissile classes could be combined and simplifiedinto a single system. The effect of the simplification of the IAEA systemnow being proposed for U.S. regulations is: 1. Elimination of the three fissile class designations; 2. Establishment of a single set of criteria for all packages of fissilematerials; 3. Use of the transport index as the primary control of accumulations ofpackages in transport under nearly all conditions; and 4. Use of special arrangements for packages which do not meet the criteria.Updating of Requirements for Shipment of LSA Material Over the last two major revisions of its transport regulations, IAEA hasbeen working to update its requirements for shipment of LSA material torecognize the developing need for transportation of irradiated and contaminatedparts and equipment from decommissioned nuclear plants. Although thesedeveloping LSA requirements were not factored into U.S. regulations whenlast updated in 1983, it is believed that the IAEA standards are now matureenough to be adopted as U.S. standards. Updating of the LSA regulations consists of the following: 1. An expansion of the LSA definition to include new types of material;2. A new definition of ``surface contaminated object'' (SCO) which is treatedin a manner similar to LSA material; and 3. An increase of specific activity limits for nondispersible, nonrespirableforms of LSA material while at the same time limiting the quantity of LSAmaterial which can be shipped in other than a Type B package. The packagequantity limit is intended to limit external radiation levels producedas a result of shielding loss in a transportation accident. The NRC and DOT have overlapping statutory authority for the regulationof the transportation of radioactive material, so the regulations of eitheror both agencies may apply, depending on the circumstances involved. Inorder that DOT may act as the only regulator of LSA materials and SCO inquantities below those where external radiation levels become important,the NRC is proposing a new exemption in andSection; 71.10. This provisionwould exempt licensees from most provisions of 10 CFR Part 71 for shipmentand carriage of LSA/SCO materials which can be transported in bulk withoutpackages (LSA-I and SCO-I), and also in their shipment and carriage ofLSA/SCO materials in packages containing up to a 2A<T2>1</T2> quantity of radioactive material. At this level of activity,NRC regulations become applicable and Type B packages, the design of whichmust be approved by NRC, are required. This action, if adopted, would havethe effect of raising the threshold level of radioactivity at which NRCregulates shipments of LSA radioactive material from the Type B quantitylevel to the level at which Type B packages are required. Although the regulations proposed by the NRC at andSection; 71.10 specify2A<T2>1</T2> as the level of contained radioactive material which causesNRC regulations and Type B packages to become applicable, the IAEA correspondingstandard is expressed as an external radiation level at 3 m from the unshieldedmaterial or object of 1 rem/hr (10 mSv/h). The value A<T2>1</T2> for any specified radionuclide is the quantity of that radionuclideas a point source which produces a radiation level of 1 rem/h at a distanceof 3 m. Considering that LSA and SCO materials are bulk sources with considerableself-shielding, the value 2A<T2>1</T2> was chosen as a close approximation of the IAEA standard of1 rem/h at 3 m. The NRC staff, in implementing this IAEA standard in 10CFR Part 71, takes the position that the radiation level standard wouldbe very difficult for the industry to apply, and that expressing the limitin units of radioactivity would be a more reasonable approach. The approachrecommended by the staff will make U.S. regulations inconsistent with thoseof IAEA, although in an area where there is little international transport.The NRC is particularly interested in whether industry shares the NRC staffview that this limit should be expressed as a limit on radioactivity becausea radiation level limit as adopted by IAEA is impractical for the industryto implement. Part 71 Inclusion of Criteria for Air Shipment of Plutonium As a result of Congressional action in 1975, Pub. L. 94-79 prohibited theNRC from licensing the air shipment of plutonium in any form until theNRC certified to the Congress that a safe container had been developedand tested such that the container ``will not rupture under crash and blast-testingequivalent to the crash and explosion of a highflying aircraft.'' The NRCdeveloped and certified to the Congress package criteria which it believedcorresponded to the Public Law and published these criteria in NUREG-0360,``Qualification Criteria to Certify a Package for Air Transport of Plutonium,''dated January 1978. This rulemaking action would amend 10 CFR Part 71 toinclude these criteria in andSection;andSection; 71.64, 71.74, and 71.88. It is the Commission's view that the import/export or domestic transportof plutonium by air pursuant to the requirements of Pub. L. 94-79, as implementedby andSection;andSection; 71.64, 71.74, and 71.88 of this part, is not affectedby section 5062 of Pub. L. 100-203. Certification of containers for theair transport of plutonium for shipments subject to section 5062 and thedevelopment of appropriate test criteria for such certification are notwithin the scope of this proposed rule. These matters will be consideredby the Commission separately from this rulemaking action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Detailed Changes </ITAG>Detailed substantive changes as proposed by the NRC for public commentare described in the following paragraphs, arranged by section number:1. Section 71.4, ``Definitions,'' would be amended as follows: _The definition of fissile classes would be deleted to correspond to themajor change of eliminating fissile classes. Fissile material would bedefined as the listed radionuclides, and the definition of fissile radionuclideswould be deleted. _The definition of low-specific-activity (LSA) material would be extensivelychanged to correspond to that of IAEA. The one remaining significant differencewould be the addition of a provision in NRC regulations for transportationof contaminated earth in a closed vehicle in unpackaged form. Extensiveremoval of contaminated earth has been found necessary in decommissioningfacilities in the United States, a process apparently not yet requiredin most other IAEA Member States. Most LSA material would be subsequentlyexempted from Part 71 control by the provisions of andSection; 71.10, ``Exemptionfor low level materials.'' The DOT regulations would specify the requirementsfor packaging LSA material. _The grandfather clause for special form radioactive material encapsulationwould be updated. _A new definition of Surface Contaminated Object (SCO) would be added tocorrespond to the parallel definition in IAEA regulations. SCO would betreated in the regulations similarly to LSA materials, with industrialpackaging required for most applications. As with LSA materials, most SCOwould be exempted from Part 71 control by the provisions of andSection; 71.10,``Exemption for low level materials.'' _Some progress has been made in expressing radiological limits in dualunits, in that limits currently expressed in units of Rems and Curies nowalso show the International System of Units (SI) equivalents in Sievertsand Bequerels along with the customary units. In most cases the limitsin customary units have been extended to 3 significant figures so theyare equal to the limits expressed in SI units to a tenth of a percent.Limits on length, pressure, weight, and temperature are expressed in SIunits in the current 10 CFR Part 71, with approximate values in customaryunits following in parentheses. Those values in customary units have beenextended to 3 significant figures to make them equal to the limits expressedin SI units. The objective of this approach is to maintain consistencywith international regulations while allowing U.S. shippers to use theunits with which they are most familiar. In the case of the special limitson shipments of plutonium in NRC regulations, for which there are no comparableinternational rules, the limits expressed in SI units have been carriedout to three significant figures to make them equal to the U.S. limitsexpressed in customary units. The end result of this effort is that licenseescan use either limit expressed in the regulations as they are consideredto be equal. The Commission is particularly interested in public commentson this method of expressing dual units in the regulations. 2. Section 71.5, ``Transportation of licensed material,'' would be amendedto correct a number of referencing errors. 3. Section 71.10, ``Exemption for low level materials,'' would be amendedto include exemptions for LSA material and SCO. The categories LSA-I andSCO-I would be limited to very low concentrations of radioactive materialwhich would be allowed to be transported unpackaged. Their exemption wouldbe specified separately in a new paragraph 71.10(c), without restrictionon total quantity. LSA-II and LSA-III materials and SCO-II would be requiredto be packaged and thus would be specified in paragraph 71.10(b) of theregulations with a package quantity limit as explained earlier in thispreamble. 4. Section 71.12, ``General License: NRC-approved package,'' would be amendedin paragraph (e) to clarify that previously approved fissile material packageswould be subject to the restrictions of 71.13, ``Previously approved package.''5. Section 71.13, ``Previously approved package,'' would be amended toupdate the restrictions for packages approved under previous editions ofthe regulations. In line with parallel provisions of IAEA transport regulations,packages acceptable under the 1967 NRC transport regulations (which correspondto the 1967 IAEA regulations) can no longer be manufactured for use butmay continue to be used. These packages must be marked with a unique serialnumber for identification and control. International use of these packagesrequires multilateral approval of all countries involved in their use.Packages acceptable under the 1983 NRC transport regulations (which correspondto the 1973 IAEA regulations) can be manufactured until the end of 1995.They will be subject to multilateral approval for international use ofthe package after 1992. Approvals for any package design can be upgradedto present status through an application which demonstrates that currentstandards are satisfied. 6. Section 71.14, ``General license: DOT specification container,'' wouldbe amended to reflect the 1985 IAEA grandfathering provisions.7. Sections 71.16-71.24, general licenses for foreign approved packagesand for fissile material packages, would be amended to clarify that thosegeneral licenses are subject to the quality assurance requirements of SubpartH of Part 71, requirements already imposed by andSection; 71.101, but whoseapplicability has been misunderstood by some persons. Minor technical changeshave also been introduced to make those general license provisions correspondto standards in IAEA transport rules. 8. Section 71.31, ``Contents of application,'' would be amended so thatandSection; 71.31(a)(3) may be satisfied by submittal of a ``quality assuranceprogram description'' as required by andSection; 71.37 or by ``referenceto a previously approved quality assurance program'' in an applicationfor package design approval. Whether or not an applicant has a previouslyapproved quality assurance program to which it can refer, the applicantshould recognize that the package design work necessary to develop thedescriptions included in its application for NRC approval must be doneunder the quality assurance program eventually approved by NRC regardingthat package design. To avoid the situation where package design work isinvalidated because changes become necessary in a quality assurance programunder which the package design work was done, an applicant may wish toobtain approval of its quality assurance program prior to investing a largeamount of effort in the package design program. The NRC encourages newapplicants, who do not yet have NRC approved quality assurance programs,to obtain at least a partial approval of the design portion of the program.In addition, andSection; 71.37(b) was moved to andSection; 71.31(c) as a moreappropriate location.   9. A new andSection; section 71.38, ``Renewal of a certificate of complianceor quality assurance program approval,'' would extend the concept of ``timelyrenewal'' from the NRC licensing regulations in 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, and70 to the package design and quality assurance approvals in 10 CFR Part71. Submittal of an application for renewal of a package certificate ofcompliance or quality assurance approval at least 30 days prior to itsexpiration would automatically extend the expiration date of the existingapproval until the NRC makes a final decision regarding the application.The provision also would require that a renewal application consolidatethe prior approval and all subsequent revisions. 10. Section 71.43, ``General standards for all packages,'' would be amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Paragraph (c) would require that a positive fastening device protectagainst a rise in internal pressure; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Paragraph (d) would require that behavior of materials under irradiationbe considered in assuring the absence of significant chemical, galvanic,or other reaction among package components and the package contents; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Paragraph (f) would continue to require that there be ``no significantincrease'' in external radiation levels as a result of subjecting a packageto the normal conditions of transport. The IAEA has quantified that increaseas being no more than 20 percent, a value the NRC staff believes is toolarge for the consequences of normal handling or minor accidents whichcan occur more than once during transport and for which no corrective actionnormally would be taken. The NRC proposes to continue to approve shieldingretention of package designs on an ad hoc basis until what it considersto be a more reasonable standard is determined. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Paragraph (h) would continue to prohibit continuous venting duringtransport but would allow intermittent venting when the associated operationalcontrols are approved by the Commission. While the IAEA regulations nolonger prohibit continuous venting, that prohibition would be continuedin NRC transport regulations because the staff considers continuous ventingto be poor engineering practice. </ITAG>11. Section 71.51, ``Additional requirements for Type B packages,'' wouldbe amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Paragraph (a)(1), as in andSection; 71.43(f), would continue to requirethat there be ``no significant increase'' in external radiation levelsas a result of subjecting a package to the normal conditions of transportnotwithstanding the IAEA's determination that a 20 percent increase constitutesno significant increase; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Paragraph (a)(2) would reduce allowable krypton-85 releases underthe hypothetical accident conditions from 10,000 Ci to 10 A</ITAG><T2>2</T2> or 2,700 Ci (10TBq). 12. Section 71.52, ``Exemption for low-specific-activity (LSA) packages,''would be written as two exemptions from certain Type B package requirementsfor packages containing only LSA material and transported as exclusiveuse. The broader of these exemptions, in paragraph (b), would be identicalto the present exemption, but would be conditioned to expire one year afterthe effective date of these amendments. While it is in effect, the broaderexemption of paragraph (b) would deal with nonapplicability of accidentresistance requirements to quantities of LSA material in excess of TypeB quantities in a single package, recognizing the very low toxicity oflow-specific-activity radioactive material. Elimination of that provisionwould subject LSA material in excess of the quantity 2A<T2>1</T2> in a single package to all Type B package standards includingthe hypothetical accident conditions. The one-year delay in discontinuingthis exemption is intended to allow the industry to develop and fabricateenough Type B waste packages to satisfy the need which would be broughton if this change were adopted. Information provided to NRC indicates thatonly 5 Type B waste packages are now in existence, while many more wouldbe needed to satisfy the need which would be created if this proposed changewere adopted. The more narrow exemption of paragraph (a) would continue to recognizethe low toxicity of LSA material, but to a lesser extent than paragraph(b), by providing an exemption from the Type B requirement in andSection;71.51(a)(1) which limits the loss or dispersal of radioactive contentsunder normal conditions of transport. That provision requires that leak-tightnessof a Type B package be demonstrated to a sensitivity of 10-6 A<T2>2</T2>, a specification unnecessary for the low toxicity LSA material.Although it would be exempt from the sensitivity provision, the LSA packagedesign would still have to satisfy the general standard of andSection; 71.43(f)that there be no loss or dispersal of radioactive contents as a resultof subjecting a package to the normal conditions of transport. 13. Section 71.53, ``Fissile material exemptions'' would be amended asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Present andSection; 71.53(b), specifying an exemption for natural anddepleted uranium which has been irradiated in a thermal reactor, wouldbe deleted because the material described would, by definition, no longerbe fissile material; and</ITAG>_The existing paragraph (g) would be redesignated andSection; 71.53(f), andit would place an additional limitation on the nitrogen-to-uranium atomicratio. 14. Section 71.57, ``Specific standards for a Fissile Class I package,''and Section 71.61, ``Specific standards of a Fissile Class III shipment,''would be deleted because the three fissile classes would be combined intonew section 71.59, ``Standards for arrays of fissile material packages.''15. A new section 71.61, ``Special requirement for irradiated nuclear fuelshipments,'' imposing a deep water immersion test would be added. 16. Section 71.63, ``Special requirements for plutonium shipments,'' wouldbe revised to accept a suggestion received from the E. I. DuPont SavannahRiver Plant during the last major revision of 10 CFR Part 71. The suggestionwas that the special requirements for solid form and double containmentnow applied to shipments of all isotopes of plutonium be applied only tothe extremely radiotoxic isotopes of plutonium (excluding plutonium-241)and to other extremely radiotoxic radionuclides as well (including, forexample, americium-241 and actinium-227). While this suggestion was favorablyreceived, it was beyond the scope of that rulemaking action and is proposednow. While the change seems reasonable from the health and safety standpoint,any significant technical and economic impacts of the change should beincluded in comments to the Commission so they may be considered. 17. Section 71.73, ``Hypothetical accident conditions,'' would be amendedto add a dynamic crush test for certain packages, and to make minor modificationsto the thermal test in accordance with changes made to IAEA regulations.Times specified for the immersion tests seem superfluous and have beendeleted. Determination of acceptance under the standard should not dependon the time of immersion. 18. Section 71.75, ``Qualifications of special form radioactive materials,''would add an alternative method to qualify a special form capsule underthe tests prescribed in the specified standard of the International Organizationfor Standardization (ISO). 19. Section 71.77, ``Tests for special form radioactive material,'' wouldadd an alternative method to qualify special form radioactive materialunder the specific impact and temperature tests prescribed in the specifiedstandard of the ISO. 20. Section 71.95, ``Reports,'' would include a new paragraph (c) to requirereporting by a licensee if any conditions of approval in the certificateof approval were not observed in making a shipment. 21. Section 71.97, ``Advance notification of shipment of nuclear waste,''would be amended to redefine the level of radioactivity at which advancenotification is required for shipments of spent nuclear fuel and radioactivewaste to make that level more uniform across the range of radionuclidestransported. The new level specified would correspond to that at whichthe DOT imposes its routing and training requirements, and to that at whichIAEA imposes additional administrative requirements such as multilateralshipment approvals. The effect of this change is expected to decrease theoverall number of packages subject to advance notification and to increasereporting of packages containing large amounts of transuranic alpha-emittingnuclides. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Regulatory Actions </ITAG>Three petitions for rulemaking were filed with the NRC in connection withthe rules for transporting LSA radioactive material. The substance of thethree petitions was essentially the same, to request that NRC exempt LSAmaterials from its requirements in 10 CFR Part 71. This would have leftthe regulation of all LSA material to the DOT. The control of LSA material,as with the control of all radioactive material, was divided at that time,as it is today, between NRC and DOT. DOT controlled carriers and shippersof small quantities of all radioactive materials through provisions inits regulations in 49 CFR, while NRC controlled shippers of fissile materialand of larger quantities of other radioactive materials through its regulationsin 10 CFR and its licensing program. The petitioners were the Energy Research and Development Administration(now the U.S. Department of Energy) in its letter dated July 23, 1975 (PRM-71-1);the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Committee N14 in its letterdated March 10, 1976 (PRM-71-2); and Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc., in itsletter dated November 22, 1976 (PRM-71-4). All three petitioners arguedthat the control NRC was exerting over transportation of LSA materialscreated an inconsistency between NRC regulations and those of the IAEAand should be discontinued. A proposed rule that would have provided theexemption for LSA materials requested in the petitions was published byNRC for public comment on August 17, 1979 (44 FR 48234). Prior to finalizationof that rule, however, a deficiency in the new LSA requirements, as proposed,was recognized so that the entire LSA proposal, including the exemption,was withdrawn. In the interim, the deficiency in the LSA requirements inthe IAEA regulations was recognized and corrected. That correction is discussedunder the ``major changes'' section of this preamble. The correction introducesa distinction between the requirements for small quantities of LSA materialand those for larger quantities. This distinction is implemented in theU.S. regulatory scheme as one set of requirements in DOT regulations forsmall quantities of LSA material and as a different set of requirementsin NRC regulations for larger quantities of LSA material. As a result of these changes in LSA requirements, the exemption requestedin the three petitions cannot be provided. The requirements proposed forinclusion in NRC regulations are consistent with the regulatory schemesof both DOT and IAEA. Because the level of radioactivity at which NRC controlsare imposed in the proposed rule is somewhat higher than in the currentrule, there is an exemption provided in andSection; 71.10 for LSA materialsup to the level where NRC regulations impose additional packaging requirements.This exemption is of limited scope, however, and does not satisfy the intentof the petitions. For the above reasons, the NRC plans to deny the threepetitions if changes proposed for the LSA portions of this rulemaking arecarried forward to the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding Of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability </ITAG>The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal actionsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment and thereforean environmental impact statement is not required.The Commission's ``Final Environmental Statement on the Transportationof Radioactive Material by Air and Other Modes,'' NUREG-0170,\3\<NOTE/> dated December 1977, is NRC's generic environmental impactstatement (EIS) covering all types of radioactive material transportationby all modes (road, rail, air, and water). From the Commission's latestsurvey of radioactive material shipments and their characteristics, ``Transportof Radioactive Material in the United States,'' SAND 84-7174, April 1985,we can conclude that current radioactive material shipments are not sodifferent from those evaluated in NUREG-0170 as to invalidate the resultsor conclusions of that EIS. Environmental impacts associated with thisproposed rulemaking are evaluated in ``Regulatory Analysis of ProposedChanges to NRC Regulations on Packaging and Transportation of RadioactiveMaterial,'' draft dated November 1987, prepared for NRC by Pacific NorthwestLaboratory, Richland, Washington. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Copies of NUREG-0170 may be purchased through the U.S.Government Printing Office by calling (202) 275-2060 or by writing to theU.S. Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013-7082.NUREG-0170 established the non-accident related radiation exposures associatedwith transportation of radioactive material in the United States as 9800person-rem which, based on the conservative linear radiation dose hypothesis,resulted in 1.7 genetic effects and 1.2 latent cancer effects per year.More than half this impact resulted from shipment of medical-use radioactivematerials. Accident related impacts were established at about 1 geneticeffect and 1 latent cancer fatality for 200 years of transporting radioactivematerials. The principal nonradiological impacts were found to be 2 injuriesper year and less than 1 accidental death per 4 years. In contrast, non-accidentrelated radiation exposures associated with this rulemaking would be increasedby 2 person-rem/y (.02 person-sieverts/y) while accident related impactswould be decreased by 4.5 person-rem/y (.045 person-sieverts/y). Nonradiologicaltraffic injuries would be increased by 0.24 per year and by 0.012 trafficdeaths per year (less than 1 accidental death per 80 years). These impactsare judged to be insignificant compared to the baseline impacts establishedin NUREG-0170. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on whichthis determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC PublicDocument Room, 1717 H Street NW., Washington, DC. Single copies of theenvironmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on whichthis determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC PublicDocument Room, 1717 H Street NW., Washington, DC.

The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternativesconsidered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspectionin the NRC Public Document Room, 1717 H Street NW., Washington, DC. Singlecopies of the analysis may be obtained from the contact identified earlier.The Commission requests public comment on the draft analysis. Commentson the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the<T2>ADDRESSES </T2>heading. <ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis </ITAG>The factors which must be considered in a backfit analysis associated withchanges in transportation regulations are evaluated in the ``RegulatoryAnalysis of Proposed Changes to NRC Regulations on Packaging and Transportationof Radioactive Material,'' draft dated November 1987. That evaluation showsvery small changes in accident risks as a result of the adoption of theproposed revision, but some reduction in maximum consequences given anaccident. The evaluation shows broad improvement in NRC regulatory consistencywith IAEA at an initial cost of $1,800,000 and a continuing annual costof $1,700,000 per year (Table S.1). The continuing costs are associated with the addition of a new limit onthe quantity of LSA radioactive material allowed in a single transportationpackage. This new limit is considered internationally to be a necessarysafety requirement to limit the consequences of a severe transportationaccident involving LSA material.The initial costs are chiefly associated with industry upgrading of itspackage safety analyses to include the proposed new accident crush andimmersion tests and with the NRC review of those new analyses. The estimatedcosts are overstated because of the assumption that all licensees usingpackages approved under earlier regulatory standards would take immediatesteps to upgrade the package analyses so the package approvals would reflectapproval under the latest revised standards. Although that is a prudentassumption absent any reasonable basis for predicting actual licensee reaction,there is little reason licensees would take any immediate action to upgradetheir package approvals. Both domestic and international regulations arebased on the responsible agency's confidence that packages built to a designapproved under earlier standards are adequately safe for continued use,although new package construction to that design would be limited and internationaluse after 1992 would require approval by all countries through which thepackage is to be transported. In actual practice, some package approvalswould never be upgraded; those that would be upgraded would be done overa period of several years as guidance and experience in upgrading becomesavailable. Although the regulatory analysis shows a small reduction in accident risksfrom the proposed changes and some reduction in maximum consequences givenan accident, the primary benefit of this rulemaking action would be toachieve consistency in radioactive material transportation regulationsbetween the United States and the rest of the world. This consistency wouldnot only facilitate the free movement of radioactive materials betweencountries for medical, research, industrial, and nuclear fuel cycle purposes,but it would also contribute to safety by concentrating the efforts ofthe world's experts on a single set of safety standards and guidance (thoseof the IAEA) from which individual countries could develop their domesticregulations. In addition, the accident experience of every country thatbases its domestic regulations on those of the IAEA could be applied toevery other country with consistent regulations to improve its safety program.In summary, the benefits and costs associated with this proposed rulemakingare of two categories. The first consists of changes to make U.S. regulationscompatible with those of the IAEA. This effort provides major benefitsincluding a substantial increase in the overall protection of the publichealth and safety, and it is associated with short-term and relativelyminor costs which are justified in view of this increased protection. Thesecond category consists of the additional limit imposed on shipments ofLSA material. This effort is associated with significant ongoing costs,but internationally the new limit is considered to be a necessary safetyrequirement to limit the consequences of a severe transportation accidentinvolving LSA material. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification </ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, (5 U.S.C. 605(b)),the Commission certifies that this rule will not, if promulgated, havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This proposed rule affects NRC licensees, including operators of nuclearpower plants, who transport or deliver to a carrier for transport relativelylarge quantities of radioactive material in a single package. These companiesdo not generally fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities''set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business SizeStandards set out in regulations issued by the Small Business Administrationat 13 CFR Part 121. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Hazardous materials transportation, Incorporation by reference, Nuclearmaterials, Packaging and containers, Penalty, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 553, the NRC is considering adoption ofthe following amendments to 10 CFR Part 71.

Toensure compatibility with international transportation standards, all limitsin this part are given in terms of dual units: The International Systemof Units (SI) followed or preceded by U.S. standards or customary units.The U.S. customary units are not exact equivalents but are rounded to aconvenient value providing a functionally equivalent unit. For the purposeof this part, either unit may be used. ``A<T2>1</T2>'' means the maximum activity of special form radioactive materialpermitted in a Type A package. ``A<T2>2</T2>'' means the maximum activity of radioactive material, otherthan special form radioactive material, permitted in a Type A package.These values are either listed in Appendix A of this part, Table A-1, ormay be derived in accordance with the procedure prescribed in AppendixA of this part. ``Carrier'' means a person engaged in the transportation of passengersor property by land or water as a common, contract, or private carrier,or by civil aircraft. ``Close reflection by water'' means immediate contact by water of sufficientthickness for maximum reflection of neutrons. ``Containment system'' means the assembly of components of the packagingintended to retain the radioactive material during transport. ``Conveyance'' means any vehicle, aircraft, vessel, or hold, compartment,or defined deck area of a vessel. ``Exclusive use'' (also referred to in other regulations as ``sole use''or ``full load'') means the sole use of a conveyance or of a large freightcontainer with a minimum length of 6 m (19.7 ft) by a single consignorand for which all initial, intermediate, and final loading and unloadingare carried out in accordance with the direction of the consignor or consignee.Any loading or unloading must be performed by personnel having radiologicaltraining and resources appropriate for safe handling of the consignment.Specific instructions for maintenance of exclusive use shipment controlsmust be issued in writing and included with the shipping paper informationprovided to the carrier by the consignor. ``Fissile material'' means plutonium-238, plutonium-239, plutonium-241,uranium-233, uranium-235, or any combination of these radionuclides. Unirradiatednatural uranium and depleted uranium, and natural uranium or depleted uraniumwhich has been irradiated in thermal reactors only are not included inthis definition. Certain exclusions from fissile material controls areprovided in andSection; 71.53. ``Low-Specific-Activity (LSA) material'' means radioactive material withlimited specific activity which satisfies the descriptions and limits setforth below. Shielding materials surrounding the LSA material may not beconsidered in determining the estimated average specific activity of thepackage contents. LSA material must be in one of three groups: (1) <T3>LSA-I.</T3> (i) Ores containing only naturally occurring radionuclides(e.g., uranium, thorium) and uranium or thorium concentrates of such ores;or (ii) Solid unirradiated natural uranium or depleted uranium or naturalthorium or their solid or liquid compounds or mixtures; or (iii) Radioactive material, other than fissile material, for which theA<T2>2</T2> value is unlimited; or (iv) Contaminated earth in a closed transport vehicle for which the estimatedaverage specific activity does not exceed 10^6A<T2>2</T2>/g.(2) <T3>LSA-II. </T3>(i) Water with tritium concentration up to 27.0Ci/andCx.31;(1TBq/andCx.31;); or (ii) Material in which the radioactive material is distributed throughoutand the estimated average specific activity does not exceed 10^4A<T2>2</T2>/g for solids and gases, and 10^5A<T2>2</T2>/g for liquids.

B(U) refers to the needfor unilateral approval of international shipments; B(M) refers to theneed for multilateral approval of international shipments. There is nodistinction made in how packages with these designations may be used indomestic transportation. To determine their distinction for internationaltransportation, see DOT regulations in 49 CFR Part 173. A Type B packageapproved prior to September 6, 1983 was designated only as Type B. Limitationson its use are specified in andSection; 71.13. ``Packaging'' means the assembly of components necessary to ensure compliancewith the packaging requirements of this part. It may consist of one ormore receptacles, absorbent materials, spacing structures, thermal insulation,radiation shielding, and devices for cooling or absorbing mechanical shocks.The vehicle, tie-down system, and auxiliary equipment may be designatedas part of the packaging. ``Special form radioactive material'' means radioactive material whichsatisfies the following conditions: (1) It is either a single solid piece or is contained in a sealed capsulethat can be opened only by destroying the capsule; (2) The piece or capsule has at least one dimension not less than 5 mm(0.197 in); and (3) It satisfies the requirements of andSection; 71.75.
