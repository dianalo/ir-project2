Lloyd, ExecutiveSecretary, DAR Council, (202) 697-7266.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">A. Background.</ITAG>An interim rule was published on April 1, 1988, to implement section 808of Pub. L. 100-180 which required that the rule be effective no later thanApril 4, 1988. A total of 44 comments were received and evaluated by theDAR Council. Several significant issues were raised in the public comments.As a result, the following major changes are being made to the regulations.First, the definition of ``required as an element of performance undera Government contract or subcontract'' was considered to be overly broadand could be interpreted to give the Government unlimited rights in technicaldata resulting from private development. The definition has been revisedto encompass only development that was both accomplished during and necessaryfor performance of a Government contract or subcontract. Second, the regulation has been revised to clearly state the Government'spolicy to protect technical data pertaining to a privately developed commercialitem. It is not the Government's policy to obtain technical data or datarights for the competitive acquisition of privately developed commercialitems. Specific approvals are now required before acquiring data or rightsin data greater than those afforded in 10 U.S.C. 2320(a)(2) (c) and (d)pertaining to such items. Third, the provisions in the interim rule that the Government would haveunlimited rights in any data not included in a list in the contract havebeen eliminated in the revised interim rule. Fourth, the notification and listing procedures have been revised to simplifyand clarify the process for establishing rights in data. The coverage hasbeen revised to clarify that the listing process does not accelerate thevalidation process and is not a final determination of rights. The formerprovisions at 252.227-7035, Preaward Notification, and at 252.227-7038,Listing and Certification of Development of Technology with Private Funding,have been merged into paragraphs (j) and (k) of the basic data rights clause,252.227-7013. Fifth, the requirement that offerors and contractors submit developmentcost data when notifying the Government that items were developed in partat private expense has been deleted, since in many cases this would beunnecessary burden. However, the contracting officer may still requestthis data, where necessary. Also, the certification has been changed toa representation that need only be provided when the offeror or contractornotifies the government of its intent to limit the government's rightsin technical data. Sixth, the responsibility of prime contractors to recognize and protecttheir subcontractor's data rights, while satisfying their contracts withthe Government, has been emphasized. Finally, guidance to the contracting officer concerning negotiations hasbeen clarified and other minor revisions have been made as a result ofthe analysis of public comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>A revised Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is necessary and is being providedto the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Administration.Interested parties may obtain a copy of the Analysis by submitting a writtenrequest to the individual listed above. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This interim rule contains information collection requirements within themeaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.Accordingly, an emergency information collection clearance request hasbeen submitted to OMB pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.18. Public comments concerningthat request will be invited by OMB through a subsequent <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Determination to Issue an Interim Rule</ITAG>A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defenseto issue this coverage. Section 808 of the National Defense AuthorizationAct (Pub. L. 100-180) required the Department of Defense to make certainchanges to the Defense FAR Supplement Regarding Technical Data. The Departmentof Defense published coverage in the April 1, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Comments from within the acquisition communityas to properly defining the rights of both the Government and contractorsin regard to Technical Data have necessitated issuance of another interimrule in this complex and sensitive area.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 227 and 252</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles W.

Computer programs includeoperating systems, assemblers, compilers, interpreters, data managementsystems, utility programs, sort-merge programs, and ADPE maintenance/diagnosticprograms, as well as applications programs such as payroll, inventory control,and engineering analysis programs. Computer programs may be either machine-dependentor machine-independent, and may be general-purpose in nature or be designedto satisfy the requirements of a particular user. ``Computer software'', as used in this subpart, means computer programsand computer data bases.``Computer software documentation'', as used in this subpart, means technicaldata, including computer listings and printouts, in human-readable formwhich (a) documents the design or details of computer software, (b) explainsthe capabilities of the software, or (c) provides operating instructionsfor using the software to obtain desired results from a computer. ``Data'', as used in this subpart, means recorded information, regardlessof form or method of the recording. ``Detailed design data'', and used in this subpart, means technical datathat describes the physical configuration and performance characteristicsof an item or component in sufficient detail to ensure that in item orcomponent produced in accordance with the technical data will be essentiallyidentical to the original item or component. ``Detailed manufacturing or process data'', as used in this subpart, meanstechnical data that describes the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing,processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or componentor to perform a process. ``Developed'', as used in this subpart, means that the item, component,or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must havebeen constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally establishedwhen the item, component or process has been analyzed or tested sufficientlyto demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art thatthere is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether,how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establishworkability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, andthe state of the art. To be considered ``developed'', the item, component,or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for saleor sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or processbe actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the UnitedStates Code.``Developed Exclusively with Government Funds'' as used in this subpart,means, in connection with an item, component, or process, that the costof development was paid for in whole by the Government or that the developmentwas required for the performance of a Government contract or subcontract.``Developed Exclusively at Private Expense'', as used in this subpart,means, in connection with an item, component, or process, that no partof the cost of development was paid for by the Government and that thedevelopment was not required for the performance of a Government contractor subcontract. Independent research and development and bid and proposalcosts, as defined in FAR 31.205-18 (whether or not included in a formalindependent research and development program), are considered to be atprivate expense. All other indirect costs of development are consideredGovernment funded when development was required for the performance ofa Government contract or subcontract. Indirect costs are considered fundedat private expense when development was not required for the performanceof a Government contract or subcontract. ``Form, fit, and function data'', as used in this subpart, means technicaldata that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performancecharacteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable)of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identificationof physically and functionally interchangeable items. ``Government purpose license rights'' (GPLR), as used in this subpart,means, rights to use, duplicate, or disclose data (and in the SBIR Program,computer software), in whole or in part and in any manner, for Governmentpurposes only, and to have or permit others to do so for Government purposesonly. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not includethe right to have or permit others to use technical data (and in the SBIRProgram, computer software) for commercial purposes. ``Limited rights'', as used in this subpart, means rights to use, duplicate,or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, by or for the Government,with the express limitation that such technical data shall not, withoutthe written permission of the party asserting limited rights, be: releasedor disclosed outside the Government; used by the Government for manufacture,or in the case of computer software documentation, for preparing the sameor similar computer software; or used by a party other than the Government,except that the Government may release or disclose technical data to personsoutside the Government, or permit the use of technical data by such person,if_(a) Such release, disclosure, or use_(i) Is necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or (ii) Is a release or disclosure of technical data (other than detailedmanufacturing or process data) to, or use of such data by, a foreign governmentthat is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluationalor informational purposes; (b) Such release, disclosure, or use is made subject to a prohibition thatthe person to whom the data is released or disclosed may not further release,disclose, or use such data; and (c) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notifiedof such release, disclosure, or use. ``Required for the Performance of a Government Contract or Subcontract'',as used in this subpart, means, in connection with the development of anitem, component, or process, that the development was specified in a Governmentcontract or subcontract or that the development was accomplished duringand was necessary for performance of a Government contract or subcontract.``Restricted rights'', as used in this subpart, means rights that applyonly to computer software, and include, as a minimum, the right to_(a) Use computer software with the computer for which or with which itwas acquired, including use at any Government installation to which thecomputer may be transferred by the Government; (b) Use computer software with a backup computer if the computer for whichor with which it was acquired is inoperative; (c) Copy computer programs for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;and (d) Modify computer software, or combine it with other software, subjectto the provision that those portions of the derivative software incorporatingrestricted rights software are subject to the same restricted rights. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, restricted rights include any other specific rights notinconsistent with the minimum rights in (a) through (d) above that arelisted or described in a contract or described in a license agreement madea part of a contract. ``Technical data'', as used in this subpart, means recorded information,regardless of the form or method of the recording of a scientific or technicalnature (including computer software documentation). The term does not includecomputer software or data incidental to contract administration, such asfinancial and/or management information. ``Unlimited rights'', as used in this subpart, means rights to use, duplicate,release, or disclose, technical data or computer software in whole or inpart, in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or permitothers to do so. ``Unpublished'', as used in this subpart, means that technical data orcomputer software has not been released to the public or furnished to otherswithout restriction on further use or disclosure. Delivery of other thanunlimited rights technical data or computer software to or for the Governmentunder a contract does not, in itself, constitute release to the public.<ITAG tagnum="80">227.472 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Acquisition Policy for Technical Data and Rights in Technical Data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">227.472-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>The acquisition of technical data and the rights to use that data requiresa balancing of competing interests. (a) <T3>The Government's Interests. </T3>The Government has extensive needsfor many kinds of technical data and the rights to use such data. It needsmay exceed those of private commercial customers. Millions of separateitems must be acquired, operated and maintained for defense purposes oftenat points remote from the source supply. Technical data are required fortraining of personnel, overhaul and repair, cataloging, standardization,inspection and quality control, packaging and logistics operations. Technicaldata resulting from research and development and production contracts mustbe disseminated to many different users. The Government must make technicaldata widely available to increase competition, lower costs and providefor mobilization. Finally, the Government has an interest in encouragingcontractors to develop new technologies and to improve existing technologiesto satisfy Government and commercial needs. To encourage contractors andsubcontractors to expend resources in developing applications of thesetechnologies, it may be appropriate to allow them to exclusively exploitthe technology. (b) <T3>The Contractor's Interests. </T3>Commercial and nonprofit organizationshave property rights and economic interests in technical data. Technicaldata are often closely held in the commercial sector because their disclosureto competitors could jeopardize the contractor's competitive advantage.Public disclosure can cause serious economic hardship to the originatingcompany. (c) <T3>The Balancing of Interests. </T3>(1) The Government's need for technicaldata and a contractor's economic interest in it do not necessarily coincide.However, they may coincide. This is true in the case of innovative contractorswho can best be encouraged to develop items of military usefulness whentheir rights in such items are scrupulously protected. (2) The Government needs to encourage delivery of data essential for militaryneeds, even though that data would not customarily be disclosed in commercialpractice. When the Government pays for research and development, it hasan obligation to foster technological progress through wide disseminationof the information and, where practicable, to provide competitive opportunitiesfor other interested parties. (3) Acquiring, maintaining, storing, retrieving, protecting and distributingtechnical data are costly and burdensome for the Government. Therefore,it is necessary to avoid acquisition of unnecessary technical data. (d) <T3>Identification of Technical Data Rights. </T3>The Department of Defenseis required by 10 U.S.C. 2320 to recognize and protect contractor rightsin technical data and to negotiate rights in technical data resulting frommixed private and Government funded development and, under 10 U.S.C. 2321,to perform a thorough review of all restrictions on its right to use ordisclose technical data. For these reasons, it is necessary that all contractorand subcontractor assertions of rights be identified in the contract asearly in the acquisition process as possible but no later than deliveryof the technical data to the Government (see 227.473-1). <ITAG tagnum="80">227.472-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Establishing Minimum Government Needs. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The Department of Defense shall obtain only the minimumessential technical data and data rights. In establishing the minimum Governmentneeds, the following factors shall be considered; whether the item, component,or process will be competitively acquired; whether repair and overhaulwork will be contracted out; whether the repair or replacement parts willbe commercial items; or whether the item will be acquired by form, fitand function data, performance specifications, or by detailed design data.In deciding how to acquire data and data rights, the Department of Defensewill use the least intrusive procedures in order to protect the contractor'seconomic interests (see Subpart 217.72). DoD Directive 5010.12, DoD DataManagement Program, sets forth policies and procedures to be followed inacquiring technical data. (b) <T3>Commercial Items. </T3>It is DoD policy to encourage the use of commercialitems to the maximum practicable extent (see 210.002 (S-70)). To furtherthis policy, it is DoD policy to limit acquisition of technical data andrights in technical data pertaining to commercial items developed at privateexpense; neither data nor data rights should be acquired for the competitiveacquisition of such a commercial item. Therefore for such commercial items,the DoD will normally only obtain technical data and data rights as providedin 10 U.S.C. 2320(a)(2) (C) and (D) (see 227.472-3(a)(1)), such as thoseneeded for operation, maintenance, installation, and training. Additionaltechnical data may not be acquired unless approved by the chief of thecontracting office, and greater data rights may not be acquired unlessapproved by the head of the contracting activity. <ITAG tagnum="80">227.472-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Rights in technical data. </ITAG>There are three basic types of rights which apply to technical data deliveredunder contract to the Government. These are unlimited rights, limitingrights, and Government purpose license rights. The Government is entitledto unlimited rights in technical data as enumerated in (a)(1) below. TheGovernment will obtain limited rights as discussed in (b)(1) below. Governmentpurpose license rights may be established in accordance with (a)(2), (b)(2),or (c) below. (a) <T3>Unlimited rights. </T3>(1) The Government is entitled to and, exceptas provided in paragraph (a)(2), will receive unlimited rights in_(i) Technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes whichhave been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds; (ii) Technical data resulting directly from performance of experimental,developmental, or research work specified as an element of performanceunder Government contract or subcontract; (iii) Form, fit, and function data pertaining to items, components, orprocesses prepared or required to be delivered under any Government contractor subcontract; (iv) Manual or instructional materials (other than detailed manufacturingor process data and commercial computer software documentation) preparedor required to be delivered under any Governmental contract or subcontractnecessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes;(v) Technical data prepared or required to be delivered under any Governmentcontract or subcontract and constituting corrections or changes to Government-furnisheddata or computer software; (vi) Technical data, which are otherwise publicly available, or have beenreleased or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor, without restrictionon further release or disclosure; (vii) Technical data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rightsas a result of negotiations; and (viii) Technical data previously delivered subject to limited rights orGovernment purposes license rights which have expired.(2) <T3>Exception to Unlimited Rights_Government Purpose License Rights. </T3>(i)To encourage commercial utilization of technologies developed under Governmentcontracts, the Government may agree to accept technical data subject toGovernment purpose license rights (GPLR). The Government shall retain theroyalty-free right to use, duplicate, and disclose data for Governmentpurposes only and to permit others to do so for Government purposes onlyfor a stated period of time. After the time priod has elapsed, the GPLRwill expire and the Government will be entitled to unlimited rights. (ii) The contracting officer should not agree to accept GPLR when_(A) Technical data are likely to be used for competitive procurement involvinglarge numbers of potential competitors, for items such as spares; and (B) Technical data must be published (e.g., to disclose the results ofresearch and development efforts). (b) <T3>Limited rights. </T3>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), theGovernment will obtain limited rights in unpublished technical data pertainingto items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense,provided the data are properly marked with the limited rights legend and,provided they are not technical data described in paragraph (a) above.(2) <T3>Exception to Limited Rights_Obtaining Greater Rights in Technical Data.</T3>(i) If the Government needs data rights pertaining to items, components,or processes developed exclusively at private expense to develop alternativesources, the contracting officer may negotiate with the contractor or subcontractorto acquire additional rights and technical assistance, where appropriate.Before acquiring additional rights, the contracting officer should consideralternatives, such as_(A) Developing alternate items, components, or processes; or (B) Obtaining a commitment by the contractor or subcontractor to qualifyadditional sources. (ii) Greater rights in technical data may be obtained by negotiation ofa lump sum fee, royalty, GPLR or other arrangement. Any greater rightsshall be stated as a separate contract line item. The contracting officershall not acquire any greater rights unless_(A) There is a need for disclosure outside the Government; and (B) If the specific rights are required for competitive procurement, theanticipated savings from competition are likely to exceed the acquisitioncost of the technical data and the rights therein. (c) <T3>Rights in Technical Data Pertaining to Items, Components, and ProcessesDeveloped with Mixed Funding. </T3>As required by 10 U.S.C. 2320, the contractingofficer will negotiate rights in technical data associated with an item,component, or process developed in part with Government funds and in partat private expense (mixed funding) whenever a contractor provides the noticecontained in 252.227-7013(j) with respect to such data. Absent the notice,the Government shall have unlimited rights in the technical data and shallhave met the obligation to negotiate. Negotiations shall begin at the earliestpossible time and the results shall be incorporated into the contract,preferably at time of award, but in any event before delivery of the data.<ITAG tagnum="80">227.473</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">227.473-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for establishing rights in technical data. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Notification requirements._</T3>(1) <T3>Background. </T3>Offerors and contractors are required by 252.227-7013(j)to notify the Government of any asserted restrictions on the Government'sright to use or disclose technical data or computer software. This noticeadvises the contracting officer of the contractor's or any subcontractor'sintended use of items, components, processes, or computer software that_(i) Have been developed exclusively at private expense; (ii) Have been developed in part at private expense; or (iii) Embody technology developed exclusively with Government funds forwhich the contractor or subcontractor requests the Government to grantexclusive commercial rights. Items, components, or processes do not needto be identified if no technical data is required to be delivered or ifthe required technical data will be delivered with unlimited rights. (2) <T3>Preaward Notification. </T3>(i) The offeror is required to identify,in its proposal, items, <ITAG tagnum="54">components, processes or computer software which it intends to useand which would result in delivery of technical data to the Governmentwith other than unlimited rights. The notification must be accompaniedby the representation described in (a)(5) below. </ITAG>(ii) After receipt of the offerors' proposals, the Government must determineif the offerors submitted the information required by 252.227-7013(j).Failure to submit should initially be treated as a correctable, minor irregularity(see FAR 15.607). However, if an offeror refuses to submit the information,then the offer may be deemed to be unacceptable. (iii) The information provided by the offeror may also be used in the sourceselection process (e.g., life cycle cost analyses). However, in no eventmay an offer be found unacceptable, for purposes of contract award, solelybecause the offeror refuses to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Governmentrights in technical data to which the offeror is otherwise entitled underapplicable law or regulation (see 227.473-2(b)). (3) <T3>Contract award. </T3>(i) The contractor's notification will serve asthe basis for the list to be included in the contract identifying all technicaldata with restrictions on the Government's right of use or disclosure thatis required by paragraph (k) of the clause at 252.227-7013. (ii) During the life of the contract, this list will be updated as neededto address additional assertions by the contractor or subcontractors underthe notification process, to incorporate the results of Government reviewsand challenges, and to specifically identify or describe all technicaldata to be delivered with restrictions on the Government's rights of useor disclosure. Also, during contract performance, changing conditions mayrequire bilateral modification of the list. (iii) The purpose of the list is to facilitate the review of contractorassertions required by 10 U.S.C. 2321 and to provide a basis for Governmentacquisition planning. It is not a final determination of rights and doesnot alter the rights of the parties under 10 U.S.C. 2320 or 2321. (4) <T3>Postaward notification. </T3>Because it may be impracticable to identifyall items, components, processes or computer software that would resultin delivery to the Government of technical data with other than unlimitedrights prior to contract award, paragraph (j) of the clause at 252.227-7013requires the contractor to continue the notification process during performanceof the contract by notifying the contracting officer prior to committingto the use of the privately developed item, component, process or computersoftware. This notification must be accompanied by the representation describedin (a)(5) below. (5) <T3>Representations. </T3>(i) If pursuant to the preaward or postawardnotification procedures the offeror/contractor notifies the Governmentthat technical data or computer software may be delivered with other thanunlimited rights, then the notice must be accompanied by the representationat 252.227-7013(j). (A) This clause authorizes the contracting officer to request additionalinformation needed to evaluate the assertions. (B) This representation assists the parties to negotiate rights in technicaldata and computer software to be delivered to the Government with otherthan unlimited rights, but does not alter the rights of the parties whichare contained in the clause at 252.227-7037. (ii) If delivery of technical data is expected under a resultant negotiatedcontract, the provision at 252.227-7028, Requirement for Technical DataRepresentation, shall be included in the solicitation. The provision requiresthe contractor to provide the following: (A) Identification of an existing contract or subcontract under which thetechnical data were delivered or will be delivered, and the place of delivery;and (B) Identification of any limitation on the Government's right to use thedata, including identification of the earliest expiration date for thelimitation. (6) <T3>Supporting information. </T3>The contracting officer should rely onthe representation provided with the contractor's notification. Detailedsupporting information, either preaward or postaward, should normally notbe requested unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validityof the assertion. While the contractor or subcontractor is obligated toprovide sufficient information to fully justify the assertions, the contractingofficer should only obtain enough information to determine if the assertionis reasonable and to evaluate its likely impact on the Government. (b) <T3>Establishing rights in technical data. </T3>(1) If the offeror or thecontractor is asserting limited rights in the technical data, the contractingofficer shall include the item, component or process in the list in thecontract described at 252.227-7013(k), unless there are grounds to questionthe validity of the assertion. If appropriate, the procedures at 217.7201will be followed and greater rights obtained pursuant to 227.472-3(b)(2).Still, the assertions are subject to Government review and possible challengein accordance with 227.473-4 and 252.227-7037. (2) If the offeror or contractor is requesting exclusive commercial rightsin technical data that would otherwise be delivered to the Government withunlimited rights, the contracting officer should agree to permit the contractorto establish exclusive commercial rights pursuant to 227.472-3(a)(2), unlessthe Government's intended use of the data would make protection of thecontractor's rights unduly burdensome. (i) Exclusive commercial rights may be accomplished by either deferringdelivery or ordering of the technical data in accordance with 227.474-2or by agreeing to accept the data with Government<ITAG tagnum="54">purpose license rights for a specified period of time in accordancewith 227.472-3(a)(2). </ITAG>(ii) The item, component, or process and the technical data will be identifiedin the list in the contract. (3) If the offeror or contractor is asserting that the item, component,or process is developed with mixed funding, then the respective rightswill be negotiated using the guidelines at paragraph (c) below and theresults identified in the listing described at 252.227-7013(k). (i) These negotiations will be conducted to the maximum practicable extentprior to contract award. However, if there are numerous offerors or underurgent circumstances, the contracting officer may determine that preawardnegotiations are impracticable. This determination must be approved bythe chief of the contracting office. The contracting officer will notifythe contractor, stating that the contractor must notify the contractingofficer if it elects to use the item, component or process. In that event,the contracting officer shall insert a provision in the contract providingprocedures for subsequent negotiation of rights.  (ii) Data rights resulting from mixed funding need not be negotiated forsmall purchases or contracts awarded using sealed bidding.    (c) <T3>Negotiation of Rights</T3>_(1) <T3>Negotiation Factors.</T3> The contracting officer shall consider, asappropriate, the following factors when negotiating rights in technicaldata developed with mixed funding or when the Government negotiates torelinquish rights or to acquire greater rights:   (i) The acquisition strategy for the item or system (including logisticssupport); (ii) Whether the item or system (or related logistics support) will becompeted;  (iii) Timing of such competition;  (iv) The economic life of the technology and whether it can be commercialized; (v) Funding contributions of the respective parties;  (vi) Development of alternative sources for industrial mobilization orother purposes;  (vii) Burden of protecting the contractor's rights in technical data; and (viii) Other factors, such as unique contractor qualification or expertisecontributing to the configuration management or development of the item,component or process.  (2) <T3>Negotiation situations.</T3> The following are examples of how thenegotiation factors in (c)(1) above may be applied.  (i) When the Government does not anticipate an early need to use the datafor competition and the contractor has requested exclusive rights in thedata, the Government may negotiate to establish limited rights which, uponexpiration of a time limitation, would become unlimited rights.  (ii) Where the Government requires early use of the data for competition,the contractor has requested exclusive commercial rights in the data, andprotecting the contractor's rights is not unduly burdensome, the contractingofficer may negotiate GPLR which would expire after a specified periodof time and become unlimited rights.  (iii) Where the Government requires early use of the data for competitionand the contractor has no interest in commercializing the data, the Governmentmay negotiate to obtain unlimited rights or to establish another suitablearrangement that would satisfy the Government's needs.  (3) <T3>Negotiation of Time Periods.</T3> When time limitations for eitherGPLR or limited rights are negotiated, they shall be expressed in the contractas a date certain and should normally be no less than one year nor morethan five years after the estimated date of first production delivery tothe Government of the item, component, process, or computer software towhich the technical data pertains. (i) Time limitations for GPLR and limited rights greater than five yearsmay be negotiated to provide the contractor a reasonable opportunity torecover its private investment, if:  (A) The technical data will not be needed for competition; and  (B) Longer periods are approved by the chief of the contracting office. (ii) Time limitations for limited rights and GPLR may be extended; if: (A) Other interested parties have not requested access to the technicaldata;  (B) The technical data need not be publicly disclosed to meet a specifiedGovernment need; and  (C) The contractor provides adequate consideration for remarking any technicaldata with revised legends.  (4) <T3>Non-Standard license rights.</T3> Unlimited rights, Government purposelicense rights, and limited rights and combinations of these rights (i.e.,with time limitations) are considered standard license rights. All otherlicense rights are considered non-standard license rights and shall notbe negotiated in technical data resulting from mixed funding unless approvedby the chief of the contracting office. Direct licensing arrangements arenot considered non-standard license rights unless they involve deliveryof technical data with non-standard rights.  (d) <T3>Standard non-disclosure agreements.</T3> (i) Technical data subjectto other than unlimited rights shall not be released outside the Governmentunless the release is subject to a prohibition against further release,use, or disclosure. If the data are subject to GPLR, the recipient mustsign the Standard Non-disclosure Agreement shown below. This Agreementmust be executed by an official authorized to bind the contractor. (ii) Nothing in this section impairs the rights of the developer of thedata and third parties from independently entering into agreements concerningcommercial uses of the data.(iii) The contracting officer shall require each contractor receiving datasubject to GPLR to execute the Standard Non-Disclosure Agreement beforereceipt of the data. If a contractor has previously signed an agreement,the earlier agreement may be provided.<ITAG tagnum="81">Standard Non-disclosure Agreement</ITAG>The undersigned (name), as the authorized representative of (company name)(hereinafter, ``the licensee''), requests technical data subject to GovernmentPurpose License Rights (hereinafter, ``GPLR data'') to compete for, perform,or to prepare to compete for, or to perform Government contracts.

The Government should review the validity of any asserted restrictionon technical data deliverable under a contract. This review should be accomplishedbefore acceptance of the technical data, but no later than three yearsafter final payment or three years after delivery of the technical datato the Government, whichever is later. The contracting officer may challengerestrictive markings if there are reasonable grounds to question theirvalidity but only if the three-year period has not expired. However, theGovernment may challenge a restrictive marking at any time if the technicaldata (1) is publicly available; (2) has been furnished to the United Stateswithout restriction; or (3) has been otherwise made available without restriction.Only the contracting officer's final decision resolving a formal challengeconstitutes ``validation'' as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.

The clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Data_Special Works,requires that any work first produced in the performance of the contractbecome the sole property of the government, and the contractor agrees notto assert any rights or establish any claim to copyright in such work.This clause requires that the contractor grant to the Government and authorizethe Government to grant to others a nonexclusive, paid-up, worldwide licensefor Government purposes in any portion of a work which is not first producedin the performance of the contract but in which copyright is owned by thecontractor and which is incorporated in the work furnished under the contract.(e) The clauses at 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7020 provide that, unless writtenapproval of the contracting officer is obtained, the contractor agreesnot to include in any work prepared, produced, originated, developed, generatedor acquired under the contract; any work of authorship in which copyrightis not owned by the contractor without acquiring for the Government andthose acting by or on behalf of the Government a nonexclusive, paid-up,worldwide license for Government purposes in the copyrighted work.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 227.481</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Acquisition of rights in computer software.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 227.481-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>(a) The Government shall have unlimited rights in:(1) Computer software resulting directly from or generated as part of theperformance of experimental, developmental, or research work specifiedas an element of performance in a Government contract or subcontract;(2) Computer software required to be originated or developed under a Governmentcontract, or generated as a necessary part of performing a contract;(3) Computer data bases, prepared under a Government contract, consistingof (i) information supplied by the Government; (ii) information in whichthe Government has unlimited rights; or (iii) information which is in thepublic domain;(4) Computer software prepared or required to be delivered under this orany other Government contract or subcontract and constituting correctionsor changes to Government-furnished software; or(5) Computer software which is in the public domain or has been or is normallyfurnished by the contractor or subcontractor without restriction.(b) When the Government has unlimited rights in computer software in thepossession of a contractor, no payment will be made for rights of use ofsuch software in performance of Government contracts or for the later deliveryto the Government of such computer software, <T3>provided</T3> however, that the contractor shall be entitled to compensationfor converting the software into the prescribed form for reproduction anddelivery to the Government.(c) It is Department of Defense policy to acquire only such rights to use,duplicate, and disclose computer software developed at private expenseas are necessary to meet Government needs. Such rights should be designedto allow the Government flexibility while, at the same time, adequatelypreserving the rights of the contractor. Computer software developed atprivate expense may be purchased or leased. Restrictions may be negotiatedwith respect to the right of the Government to use, duplicate, or disclosecomputer programs or computer data bases developed at private expense.As a minimum, however, the Government shall have the rights provided inthe definition of restricted rights in Section 227.471.(d) Patented or copyrighted computer software will not be subject to anyagreement prohibiting the Government from infringing a patent or copyright.Title 28, United States Code, Section 1498 provides that the Governmentis liable only for reasonable compensation for use of a patented inventionor for infringement of copyright. However, see Section 227.7011. (e) When computer software is developed at private expense and acquiredwith restricted rights, the associated computer software documentationwill be acquired with limited rights to the extent provided in the definitionof limited rights in Section 227.471, and will not be used for preparingthe same or similar computer software.(f) Commercial computer software and related documentation developed atprivate expense may be leased, or a license to use may be purchased, bythe Government subject to the restrictions in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of theclause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software.<ITAG tagnum="80">227.481-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Procedures. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Deviations.</T3> All requests for deviations from this andSection; 227.481shall be submitted to the DAR Council in accordance with the proceduresin FAR 1.404.(b) <T3>General.</T3> (1) Except as provided under 252.227-7031, Data Requirements,any computer program or computer data base to be acquired under a contractshall be listed on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD Form 1423).Also, if a contract requires the conversion of data to machine-readableform, the editing or revision of existing programs, or the preparationof computer software documentation, the products of this work, if requiredto be delivered, shall be included on the DD Form 1423.(2) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software,shall be included in every contract under which computer software may beoriginated, developed, or delivered. That clause establishes the circumstancesunder which the Government secures unlimited rights in both technical dataand computer software, limited rights in technical data, and restrictedrights in computer software. In negotiated contracts where the clause at252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software, is required,the provision at 252.227-7019, Identification of Restricted Rights ComputerSoftware, shall be included in the solicitation. (3) Contracts under which computer software developed at private expenseis acquired or leased shall explicitly set forth the rights necessary tomeet Government needs and restrictions applicable to the Government asto use, duplication and disclosure of the software. Thus, for example,such software may be needed, or the owner of such software will only sellor lease it, for specific or limited purposes such as for internal agencyuse, or for use in a specific activity, installation or service location.In any event, the contract must clearly define any restrictions on theright of the Government to use such computer software, but such restrictionswill be acceptable only if they will permit the Government to fulfill theneed for which such software is being acquired. The recital of restrictionsmay be complete within itself or it may reference the contractor's licenseor other agreement setting forth restrictions. If referencing is employed,a copy of the license or agreement must be attached to the contract. Theminimum rights are provided in the Rights in Technical Data and ComputerSoftware clause at 252.227-7013, and need not be included in the recital.(4) When computer software developed at private expense is modified orenhanced as a necessary part of performing a contract, only that portionof the resulting product in which the original product is recognizablewill be deemed to be computer software development at private expense towhich restricted rights may attach. (5) The scope of the restrictions on or, conversely, the scope of the usewhich the Government is permitted to make of such software shall be takeninto account in determining the reasonableness of the contract price forthe computer software.(c) <T3>Computer software subject to restricted rights.</T3> (1) Because ofthe widely-varying restrictions which are likely to be encountered in thepurchase or lease of computer software developed at private expense, astandard recital setting forth specific restrictions and rights suitablefor all cases is not feasible. If the standard set of restrictions andrights set forth in paragraph 227.481-1(f) for commercial computer softwareis not appropriate, personnel are urged to consult counsel in any casein which the proposed contractor requests the Government to accept otherrestrictions on the use of such software. (2) To apprise user personnel of the restrictions on use, duplication ordisclosure agreed to by the Government with respect to such software soldor leased to the Government, the contractor is required to place the followinglegend on such software:<ITAG tagnum="74">Restricted Rights Legend </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Use, duplication or disclosure is subject to restrictions stated inContract No. <T2>XXXX</T2> with (Name of Contractor).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For commercial computer software and documentation, the contract numbermay be omitted and replaced by ``paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights inTechnical Data and Computer Software clause at 252.227-7013'', and thecontractor's address added.

Such markings shall beaffixed by the contractor to the computer software prior to delivery ofthe software to the Government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) The human-readable markings may be applied to card decks, magnetictape reels, or disc packs. This may be, in the case of a card deck, ona notice card even though the cards of the deck do not contain printedmaterial; in the case of a card deck packaged in a container intended asa permanent receptacle for the cards, on the container; in the case ofa tape, on the tape reel or on the surface of the leader and trailer ofthe tape; and in the case of a disc pack, on the hub of the disc. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) <T3>Unmarked or improperly marked computer software. </T3>(1) No restrictivemarkings shall be placed upon computer software unless restrictions areset forth in the contract prior to delivery of the software.

The Government may requirethe contractor to identify the contractual provision setting forth suchrestrictions before accepting computer software with restrictive markings.If computer software is received with restrictive markings, and there isa question whether it is authorized by the contract to be furnished withrestricted rights, it shall be used subject to the asserted restrictionspending written inquiry to the contractor. If no response to an inquiryhas been received within 60 days, or if the response fails to identifythe restrictions set forth in the contract, the cognizant Government personnelshall cancel or ignore the markings, notify the contractor accordinglyin writing, and thereafter use the software with unlimited rights. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Computer software received without a restrictive legend shallbe deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. However, the contractormay request permission to place restrictive markings on such software atits own expense, and the Government may so permit, if the contractor establishesthat the markings are authorized by the contract and demonstrates thatthe omission was inadvertent. Failure of the contractor to mark such computersoftware prior to delivery to the Government shall relieve the Governmentof liability for any use, duplication or disclosure of such computer software.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) If computer software authorized by the contract to be furnishedwith restrictions is received with restrictive markings not in the formprescribed by the contract, the software should be used in accordance withthe restrictions provided for in the contract and the contractor shallbe required by written notice to correct the markings to conform with thosespecified in the contract. If the contractor fails to correct the markingswithin 60 days after notice, Government personnel may correct the markings,and so notify the contractor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">227.482 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved] </ITAG>3.
