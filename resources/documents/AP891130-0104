F. Henry Habicht, the EPA's deputy administrator, told anagriculture conference that his agency has been working withAgriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to work out proposals for thelegislation, which will set farm policy for several years.   He commended agricultural officials for a ``visionary view'' inresponse to public concerns about pesticides and food safety.   ``Farmers were the first environmentalists,'' said Habicht. Hesaid encouraging farmers to use wise environmental methods is not``an attitude issue, but an information issue.''   Agriculture Deputy Secretary Jack Parnell, who appeared withHabicht, took a hard line toward food safety questions raised byenvironmental organizations.   ``Do not be afraid of your critics ... or their noise,'' he toldthe participants at the closing program of Outlook '90, a three-dayconference sponsored by the Agriculture Department.   He said that technology has made American agriculture the mostsuccessful in the world, partly through use of chemicals.   He cautioned against ``those who would like to tear down anddestroy by quoting half truths from pseudo-scientists.''   He said breakthroughs in science have enabled researchers todetect chemical residues in food in much smaller quantities thanever before.   He questioned whether ingestion of a one part per trillion of aparticular residue over a 70-year lifetime should be legislatedagainst.   ``Don't allow policy to move ahead of science or common sense,''he said.   He said he does support speedy removal from the market ofchemicals that have been determined hazardous to health and hailedPresident Bush's legislative proposals for streamlining laws thatdo just that.   ``When the United States sits down to supper, it should expect awholesome supper with the safest food in the world,'' Parnell said.   Dr. Frank Young, outgoing commissioner of the Food and DrugAdministration, also questioned the need to be concerned aboutminute quantities of chemical residues in food.   ``In the 1960's and 70's, we began to identify compounds thatmight cause cancer,'' he said. ``But we could only identify onepart per 1,000 or one part per 10,000.   Today, scientists can detect one part per trillion or one partper million trillion, he said.   That ability has allowed residue to be detected that could notbe found before but is not necessarily harmful to health, he said.   ``We must be very careful that the nation's health or economydoes not fall prey to self-appointed priests of demagoguery,'' saidYoung.   Habicht acknowledged the farmer's central role in the Americaneconomy and said his agency has no interest in retardingagricultural productivity.   But he said that, ``for the past 20 years, we've beenidentifying problems and scrambling to clean up.''   He said the policies of the future must be preventive.</TEXT></DOC>
