The struggle has come to a head here at the annual meetingof the club of 24 rich nations, the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development. The fight pits the U.S., backedby Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many other foodexporters outside the OECD against the European Community.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We have hit a snag in our negotiations,&quot; White HouseTrade Representative Carla Hills told reporters. &quot;It means atthe least that the European Community isn't yet prepared todeal with {agricultural} export subsidies.&quot; Earlier in theday, Mrs. Hills told ministers that agricultural trade is the&quot;linchpin&quot; of the current round of world trade talks beingheld under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   Frans Andriessen, the EC's vice president for externalrelations, said the U.S. &quot;has fallen prey tooversimplification&quot; in insisting that agriculture is socentral to the GATT talks. &quot;Some people wanted to bringpressure to get back to positions we have given up,&quot; said Mr.Andriessen, a former minister in the Dutch government.   The squabble centers on how to implement a commitment thatthe GATT's 97 member countries made in April 1989 tonegotiate &quot;a substantial progressive reduction&quot; of subsidiesand other policies that distort agricultural trade. The U.S.and its supporters want to implement that commitment throughnegotiations involving four separate aspects of agriculturaltrade: market access; internal price supports; exportsubsidies; and health and sanitation rules, which sometimesare used to protect agricultural markets.   But the 12 nations of the European Community were preparedthis week only to repeat their endorsement of the earlier,general GATT statement against agriculture subsidies,according to U.S. and Canadian officials.   &quot;This is a framework that could be accepted, and would beaccepted, by everyone in the world except the EC,&quot; said U.S.Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.   The EC, whose overall agricultural subsidies are estimatedto cost as much as $125 billion a year, wants to consider alltrade-distorting agricultural policies in the aggregaterather than looking at specific areas as proposed by the theU.S. That, according to Washington, would give the Europeansroom to maintain export subsidies while giving some ground inother areas. The U.S., whose subsidies are estimated to costas much as $75 billion a year, seems much more willing to getrid of such devices.   The EC's commissioner for agriculture, Ray MacSharry, saidagricultural reform &quot;is a difficult and complex subject totackle&quot; and averred that the EC remains committed to &quot;thepath of reform that it initiated several years ago.&quot; He saidthat since 1986 the EC has cut its overall support for thearable sector 10%, and its support for the livestock sector15%.   Mrs. Hills and Mr. Yeutter said at a news conference thatthe dispute over agricultural trade will be left unresolvedin the OECD's annual communique, which is scheduled forrelease today. That communique is expected to contain therespective positions of the two groups of countries withoutattempting to reconcile them.   Some ministers were particularly gloomy about the outcomeof the OECD discussions on agricultural trade. There's &quot;noreason for optimism from the discussions today,&quot; saidCanada's trade minister, John Crosbie, who said the deadlockover agriculture could threaten the whole round of GATTnegotiations.   The GATT talks began in 1986 and are due to be completedby the end of this year. Mr. Yeutter noted that the 97countries participating in the GATT talks previously agreedto reach outline accords covering 15 different areas oftrade, including agriculture, by July. A final accord must bereached by year end to meet U.S. legislative deadlines deemedessential for the pact's approval by Congress. Because theU.S. is the world's largest economy and largest exporter, atrade plan would be doomed by its failure to go along.   Agricultural protectionism has been growing in recentyears. Mr. Yeutter said protectionism currently adds 40% tothe value of agricultural goods, compared with 21% in themid-1960s.   Some in the EC recognize the benefit of getting rid ofagricultural subsidies, and the U.S. and other nationsclearly hope that dialogue among EC countries in the comingweeks will produce a greater willingness to compromise.Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major argued thatthe potential benefits are &quot;huge,&quot; saying that by oneestimate liberalizing agricultural protection and subsidieswould save $60 billion in annual government subsidies inindustrial countries and offer developing countriescomparable income gains.   ---   Tim Carrington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
