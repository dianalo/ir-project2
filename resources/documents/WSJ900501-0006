The first edge of the wave arrived Friday, as federalthrift regulators took control of Home Owners Savings Bank inBurlington, Mass., and a smaller Massachusetts bank disclosedthat it is seeking financial assistance from the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Regulators privately acknowledge that they will soon bestepping in at more New England institutions.   At least a dozen more banks from Connecticut to Maine haveseen their capital shrink to perilously slim levels in recentmonths, and even more could find themselves tottering at thebrink of insolvency if the region's anemic real estate marketdoesn't pick up soon, analysts say. Gerard Cassidy, a bankanalyst at Tucker Anthony Inc.'s Portland, Maine, office,predicts &quot;a minimum of two dozen bank and thrift closuresover the next three to four years, when this {real estateglut} finally washes out.&quot;   Some companies have issued warnings to shareholders inrecent weeks. One Bancorp, a Portland company with $2.3billion in assets, told investors that its &quot;ability topreserve any value in its securities would remain in doubt,&quot;unless it carries out an ambitious capital-recovery plan.Eliot Bank, Boston, reported a $13.8 million deficit inshareholders' equity and warned that &quot;if additional capitalis not raised, it is expected that . . . regulatory agencieswould take such actions as they consider appropriate,including the possible appointment of a receiver for thebank.&quot;   Bank of New England Corp., one of the region's largestcommercial banks with more than $20 billion in assets, isworking on a plan to recover from a $1.1 billion loss lastyear. But company officials have acknowledged that the plan'ssuccess may hinge on the health of the New England economy.   Veribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., company that rates thefinancial condition of banks, placed 24 Massachusetts banksin its &quot;red&quot; category in last year's fourth quarter, up fromtwo in the 1989 first quarter. The classification coversinstitutions with equity of less than 3% of assets, or with anet loss such that it may become insolvent in less than ayear if the loss continues at the same rate. In NewHampshire, red-rated institutions jumped to 13 from zero lastyear, and the number in Connecticut climbed to eight fromone.   That isn't to say that New England faces anywhere near theproblems that the Southwest faced in the 1980s. Despitegrowing concern about a possible credit crunch in the region,most banks remain fairly well capitalized. A study by theBoston office of Grant Thornton, the accounting firm, foundthat average equity capital for Massachusetts banks withassets from $25 million to $500 million was 8.98% of assets,still above the 8.65% for comparable banks nationwide. And,so far at least, only scattered incidents of executive fraudhave been uncovered in New England.   But after long enjoying a reputation as among the soundestand most conservative in the nation, many New Englandfinancial institutions now find themselves paying the pricefor recklessly aggressive commercial real-estate lending inthe mid-1980s. Many of the region's mutual savings bankscashed in on Wall Street's bull market and New England'snew-found cachet by converting to stock ownership and issuingshares during those years. With real-estate values soaringthroughout the region, most promptly raced to lend theproceeds to developers.   But as the economy cooled in the past two years, scores ofdevelopers were driven into bankruptcy and banks foundthemselves trying to collect on unsold condominiums andhalf-vacant office buildings, structures that in some casesare now valued at half the original appraisals.   Few were as aggressive -- or as controversial -- as HomeOwners. After converting from mutual to stock ownership, thecompany bought up mortgage-banking firms and savings-and-loanassociations around the country. It also invested heavily inarcane mortgage-related assets whose estimated value dependedon assumptions about interest-rate movements and otherfactors. The company's assets soared to more than $4 billionfrom $547 million in 1984. But critics called it a house ofcards built with 1980s accounting gimmickry.   Whether or not those charges were true, it was apparent bylast fall that Home Owners would have a hard time survivingunder the new, more conservative thrift regulations. AlbertHolgerson Jr., who led the company throughout the 1980s, wasforced out by federal regulators. Remaining company officialssaid they would try to turn back the clock, returning to theplain-vanilla business of taking deposits and making loans.But a loss of nearly $130 million in the quarter ended Sept.30 left the company badly crippled.   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it had placed HomeOwners under government conservatorship because it &quot;wasoperating in an unsafe and unsound manner.&quot; The agency alsonoted that the company had negative tangible capitalamounting to $106.3 million at Dec. 31.   Meanwhile, Home National Corp. of Milford, Mass., said itexpects a $4.8 million first-quarter loss to reduce itsshareholders' equity to a deficit of at least $4.1 million.The company, which has $486 million in assets, said its HomeNational Bank subsidiary has asked the FDIC for a capitalinjection that would enable it to continue operating, a formof government assistance that has been granted to some banksin Texas and Oklahoma.</TEXT></DOC>
