Who could ask for more in a police department?    Mayor Kathy Whitmire, for one.    Upset over the way they are paid for court appearances, among other issues, protesting police officers here are writing about 40% fewer tickets than budget makers had forecast. That slowdown, if it continues, will mean $13 million less in traffic fines than had been counted on in the coffers of budget-conscious Houston this fiscal year -- the biggest share of a projected $19 million budget deficit.    Although the projected total deficit is just a drop in Houston's budget bucket -- less than 3% of the general fund for the year -- it is forcing the city to heap a new round of painful cutbacks after years of scraping to the bone.    Take those 100 municipal-court workers who just got handed pink slips. Some of them were deemed dispensable because they processed traffic ticket fines.    Hours have been cut at the Houston Public Library with the result that people with nine-to-five jobs will have trouble finding the time to go.    Even the petting zoo is in jeopardy. The director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department is threatening to close the popular, free attraction this summer if the department can't hire more zoo keepers. A private fund drive is under way to keep the Discovery Zoo open.    Two months ago Mayor Whitmire proclaimed the worst to be over for Houston's economy, and her aides are quick to assert that this latest round of budget headaches isn't an oil-recession relapse.    Lee Hogan, president of the Houston Economic Development Council, points to several barometers of returning health for the region -- unemployment is down to about 8% from as high as 12.9%; the help-wanted index has risen monthly for more than a year; foreclosures have decreased in each of the past six months; the area added 15,000 jobs during the last five months of 1987; and the percentage of the Houston economy deemed to be energy-related dropped to 64% in 1987 from 81% in 1983 -- all cause for celebration.    So what has given the men and women in blue the blues?    The Police Department, which just did a survey that confirmed the drop-off in tickets, won't talk about it. But Tommy Britt, an officer who is president of the policy officer's union, said the slowdown stems from a cut in pay for court time and &quot;harsh&quot; discipline for not showing up in court at all.    &quot;It didn't take long for people to see that if they wrote fewer tickets, they'd spend less time in court and be disciplined less,&quot; he explained.    The slowdown is in no way official or organized, Mr. Britt said; such an orchestrated action would be illegal in Texas. &quot;We've just lost our enthusiasm for writing tickets,&quot; he said.    That enthusiasm would return to normal, he said, if the city gave officers a regular court date again, paid them more for court time and eliminated the one-day suspension for failing to appear.    &quot;When police officers scream they need a pay raise on one hand and cause a drop in city revenues on the other hand, they are at cross purposes with their own cause,&quot; a spokesman for the mayor said. The spokesman adds that while Houston's general fund has increased only 2.7% over the past five years, the police department budget has gone up 25% during that period.    The rest of the city's projected deficit for the year comes from cost overruns in the city employees' health-benefit package. The city will start charging each worker $10 a month for health-care coverage to help defray those costs, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
