But it wasn't immediately clear whether the legislation, which was passed after only about three hours of debate by the House and Senate meeting simultaneously in special session, would end takeover speculation about Dayton Hudson.    Other companies marked by traders as takeover candidates have had to take drastic steps to remain independent even though their states strengthened anti-takeover laws. In Ohio last year, Akron-based Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. didn't shake an offer by the Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith until it bought back 48% of its stock, a move it financed by putting several units on the block.    Dart, a Landover, Md.-based discount retailer controlled by the Haft family of Washington, D.C., wouldn't say what it might do next regarding Dayton Hudson.    Nonetheless, the likelihood that the Minnesota lawmakers would pass the anti-takeover bill seemed to take some pressure off Dayton Hudson during the trading day. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the company's stock fell $1, to close at $50 a share, on volume of 3.1 million shares. In the past two weeks, Dayton Hudson stock had traded as high as $63 a share and had never fallen as low as $50.    The Minnesota legislation, which was signed into law by the governor late last night, passed 120-5 in the House and 57-0 in the Senate. The bill is patterned on an Indiana anti-takeover law that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in April. The Minnesota bill makes a hostile takeover of a publicly traded Minnesota company much more difficult. It gives shareholders the right to decide whether a shareholder can vote more than 20% of the company's shares. And it restricts for five years an acquirer's selling the assets of an acquired company to pay takeover-related costs.    The legislation, however, is broader than the Indiana statute and includes provisions like those in other state laws that haven't been tested in court. The five-year restriction on asset sales, for example, resembles a New York law that hasn't faced a legal challenge.    Stephen Fraidin, a partner in the New York law firm of Fried Frank Harris Shriver andamp; Jacobson, suggested that some of the new state laws might not be upheld by the high court. &quot;I think the Supreme Court has not yet said the final word on takeover law,&quot; he added.    What's more, in at least one instance since the Indiana law was upheld, a target company still had to adopt other defenses against an unwanted suitor. In May, the North Carolina Legislature passed an Indiana-style bill designed to help Greensboro-based Burlington Industries Inc. avoid a hostile takeover bid by New York investor Asher B. Edelman and Montreal-based Dominion Textile Inc. Burlington now is being taken private by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. in a friendly leveraged buyout.    Dayton Hudson executives weren't available for comment yesterday on whether they would take further defensive steps. The company has a so-called poison pill, which is designed to make a takeover prohibitively expensive and can be used if an investor gets 20% of Dayton Hudson common and launches a tender offer. But Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive officer, told Minnesota legislators earlier this week that the retailer doesn't want to use other defenses, such as a leveraged buyout, selling parts of the company or being acquired by a friendly suitor. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    One option that remains open to Dayton Hudson is so-called greenmail, a company's buying back its stock from an unwanted suitor at higher-than-market prices. Though most of the important elements of the Minnesota legislation would apply retroactively to June 1, a new restriction on payment of greenmail to holders of more than 5% of a company's common stock wouldn't take effect until March 1988. Mr. Macke said earlier this week that he wouldn't rule out paying greenmail if necessary.    Meanwhile, it still isn't clear whether Dart will make another move on Dayton Hudson. Dart, which operates the Crown Books discount chain and the Trak Auto chain of automotive supply stores, has said it wants to buy a major retailer or real estate concern. Dayton Hudson executives have said that Dart has bought a stake in the company and proposed acquiring it. But Dart officials haven't confirmed that the company has a Dayton Hudson stake. </TEXT></DOC>
