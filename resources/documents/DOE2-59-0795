<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0795 </DOCNO><TEXT>A genetic sexing strain of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitiscapitata (Wied.), with females having black pupal colour and males brownpupal colour, has been obtained. Translocations were induced in adultmales which were 48 h old from the normal strain at a gamma radiationdose of 55 Gy. Use of this strain in integrated control programmes usingsterile male releases seems very promising and this possibility shouldbe analysed. (author). 12 refs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
