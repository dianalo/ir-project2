The bank, which also absorbed a plunge in interest earnings, said full operating earnings of the parent bank in the first 10 months fell 36% from a 10-month average taken from 1986. Group results, including the bank's foreign operations, showed a 27% drop. Both declines were adjusted to exclude the extraordinary boost to 1986 earnings from the multibillion-dollar purchase and resale of the Flick industrial group. The bank had reported a 28% decline in parent-bank operating earnings for the first half.    &quot;Deutsche Bank's profits are clearly falling faster than other people's, but one has to remember that they are falling from a higher level,&quot; said George Siebenburgen, a bank analyst for the Frankfurt office of the Bank in Liechtenstein. Deutsche Bank's shares rose 2.5 marks ($1.51) yesterday, to 412 marks ($249.05). </TEXT></DOC>
