 More accurately, thebest parts of Ashton-Tate will be merged into Borland, and A-T--the name andcompany--will cease to exist.andP;  Senior Editor Dian Schaffhauser explains allthe facts and issues involved in Borland's massive acquisition of A-T on page160.andP;  Here, I'll drag out all the menacing issues and see if we can put itinto perspective.andM;The deal's not a surprise--not really.andP;  Borland tried to buy Ashton-Tate inearly 1990, an attempt that eventually led to the ouster of A-T Chairman EdEsber.andP;  When I talked with Borland Chairman Philippe Kahn last spring (DBA,April 1991) he mentioned his interest and thoughts on how powerful thecombination would be.andM;Since coming on board in May 1990, A-T Chairman Bill Lyons has done acommendable job of getting dBASE IV fixed and out the door, mending lots ofbroken fences, and bringing new credibility and respect to A-T.andP;  But therehas'nt been much forward motion.andP;  A-T has been exceedingly conservative in amarket where passivity isn't an option.andM;Instead of dazzling us with new products, Lyons has cut staff and reducedexpenses to make A-T less flabby and more profitable.andP;  The release of thedBASE Professional Compiler has taken suspiciously longer than it should,almost as if A-T didn't want to take on the marketing and support load.andO;Interbase was made a wholly-owned subsidiary to prove that A-T has control ofits client/server technology.andP;  Their party line has been mostly aboutstability and profitability rather than innovation and leadership.andP;  To some,the emphasis on A-T's business position has been signaling &quot;buy me&quot; forseveral months.andM;Now, Borland has to show its shareholders--and the rest of us--what it gotthat was worth $440 million.andP;  Yes, Borland paid for A-T with funny money(newly issued stock) and got some hard assets, including cash andreceivables.andP;  But it still has to prove that buying A-T was better thanbeating A-T in the marketplace.andP;  The challenge for Borland's technical andmarketing wizards is to leverage A-T's soft assets into something well beyond&quot;Paradox eats dBASE.&quot;andM;* What does Borland wantandM;with A-T?andM;Some say Ashton-Tate doesn't have any real value beyond the brand name dBASEand access to the huge number of people who own a copy.andP;  These are, in fact,the most bankable of A-T's soft assets.andP;  But the technology of A-T'ssubsidiary Interbase is a sleeper, a superb client/server product that justneeds to support some more mainstream front ends.andP;  The multi-platformstrategy of dBASE IV (&quot;runs on everything from PCs to pocket calculators!&quot;)andO;is an edge that makes corporate folks smile.andP;  The technology in the A-T labmay or may not become dBASE V, but it's good stuff that Borland can build on.andO;The same goes for the dBASE Professional Compiler, which will never appear inits promised form.andP;  Borland can also gain a big edge via Ashton-Tate'spowerful worldwide marketing presence.andP;  About seventy percent of dBASE salesare from outside North America, while Borland's percentage is the reverse.andO;Pushing Quattro Pro, Paradox, the Turbo languages, and dBASE into newinternational markets could double Borland's sales.andM;Ashton-Tate also has some good people, though that's the sad part of thisstory.andP;  Borland operates with a staff of 1,000, while A-T has, 1,700.andP;  Thecombined company will have revenue roughly twice that of Borland.andP;  Based onBorland's sales-per-employee ratio, at least 700 A-Ters will be out of work.andO;Maybe more, since Borland has no obligation to keep anyone.andP;  Most vulnerableare those at A-T who duplicate non-technical functions within Borland.andP;  Techsupport and some developers will probably be needed, though it's likely torequire a move north.andP;  Ashton-Tate's castle-like Southern Californiaheadquarters is a white elephant that even A-T had been phasing out in favorof its San Jose site in Northern California.andP;  Borland is building a newcampus headquarters just 20 miles up a mountain road in Scotts Valley.andM;* dBASE--the crown jewel?andM;Then there's dBASE.andP;  Buying Ashton-Tate gives Borland immediate claim to theentire installed base of dBASE III Plus and dBASE IV.andP;  It might even giveBorland control of the X-Base market, something that has gone unclaimed sinceA-T failed to demonstrate leadership with dBASE IV.andP;  Two and a half years ago(DBA, March 1989) I described the X-Base market as &quot;a huge ship, adrift on anopen sea, with no rudder and no sail.&quot;andP;  And it still is.andP;  The X-Base marketwants a leader.andP;  Fox and Nantucket have demonstrated innovation and technicalwizardly, but their relatively small, private ownership status is a factor.andO;Publicly-held Borland has a relatively good reputation among users of alltypes, from individuals to corporate MIS directrs.andP;  The Borland name on thedBASE box may bring back the confidence and reputability that has beenslipping away for years.andM;* Developers panic in the streetsandM;Have you noticed how much fear and loathing this deal generated in thedeveloper community?andP;  Some X-Basers see gloom and doom.andP;  Among the earlyrumors and opinions: Borland will kill dBASE and force everyone to switch toParadox.andP;  Absurd; who would intentionally pay $440 million for the biggestname in database then kill it?andP;  Others fear Paradox will be phased out infavor of dBASE, which is also silly.andP;  Paradox has succeeded precisely becauseit's different from dBASE.andP;  My favorite is the bizarre claim that Borlandwill not evolve dBASE IV, forcing everyone to switch to its coming compiler,dBASE for Windows.andP;  Windows isn't that big (yet)!andP;  The DOS market has way toomuch life left in it to do this.andM;In case you're still worried, I asked Borland executives Philippe Kahn, RobDickerson, and Dave Micek.andP;  Their plan, obvious yet brilliant, is to pushforward on all fronts simultaneously.andP;  Ashton-Tate wasn't doing things wrong,it just wasn't doing enough of the right things.andM;Borland has winners in Paradox, Quattro Pro, and the Turbo languages.andP;  Itjust needs the biggest market of all: dBASE.andP;  Nothing could be smarter thantrying all of these products plus Interbase (and more) together and promotingit as developer heaven.andP;  &quot;Mix and match front ends and back ends in one big,happy, object-oriented family.&quot;andP;  Whatever you want to do, a Borland productpromises to bolt right in and do it, compatibly and synergistically.andM;Let's put down the rose-colored glasses long enough to recognize the gapbetween promising and doing.andP;  Folks are optimistic now, willing to wait andsee.andP;  But Borland has a lot of work to do, quickly, before our patience andthe window of opportunity slams shut.andP;  No one knows if they can do it.andM;* The other X-Basers...andM;Some say Borland's dBASE for Windows compiler will kill Nantucket.andP;  Possibly,but slowly, and only if Nantucket lets it.andP;  Right now it's tough forNantucket to compete against people's perceptions of Borland's unreleasedproduct.andP;  Based on public information and experience with other Borlandproducts, expectations for dBASE for Windows are high.andP;  But, for obviousreasons, it's going to be mainly a dBASE III and IV compiler.andM;Clipper is a superb product, different enough to stand on its merits.andO;However, Borland's competition is likely to force Nantucket to increase thepace of Clipper's evolution and the development of Nantucket's Windows-basedproduct, code-named Aspen--if it can.andM;The same goes for Fox, though FoxPro may actually benefit short-term from theBorland/A-T deal.andP;  Based on Philippe Kahn's publicly stated views againstusing the courts to compete, Borland is expected to drop the A-T/Fox lawsuit(via settlement).andP;  Borland almost has to, since its argument against Foxwould be almost the opposite of its defense against Lotus.andP;  (Borland has beensued by Lotus, which claims Quattro Pro steals the look and feel of 1-2-3.).andM;Eliminating the lawsuit will remove the black cloud hanging over Perrysburg,allowing corporations that like FoxPro 2 to adopt it.andP;  On the downside,FoxPro's similarity to dBASE IV puts it within Borland's competitive sights.andO;Borland may take a while to produce a significantly improved dBASE IV, so Foxhas time to build market share based on its unique and considerablestrengths.andM;WordTech may have missed its window of opportunity.andP;  But the time they bringArago to market, its considerable merits may be ignored by those satisfiedwith FoxPro and/or anticipatingx Borland's versions of dBASE.andP;  However,WordTech recently purchased VP Expert and VP Graphics from PaperbackSoftware.andP;  If their expert system and graphics capabilities can be integratedwith Arago, WordTech may have the functionality and differentiation it needsto compete.andM;* Strange bedfellowsandM;Yes, we seem to be in an intense period of merges, acquisitions, and jointventures among strange bedfellows.andP;  Borland buys A-T to dominate the databasemarket.andP;  IBM partners with Sears to bring Prodigy to every home, then withApple and Motorola to outgun Microsoft and Intel.andP;  Novell acquires DigitalResearch to take on Microsoft on both the DOS and network operating systemlevels.andP;  I expect Radio Shack and McDonalds to jointly offer us a CD playerthat makes fries.andM;Some say the only way for Fox and Nantucket and WordTech to compete, and evensurvive, is to be acquired by larger companies.andP;  Microsoft, Lotus,Wordperfect, Novell, IBM, and Computer Associates are mentioned as firms withthe money and the need to offer database and/or X-Base products.andP;  Once thelawsuit is put to bed, removing the threat to all X-Base products, someonemay drop in on Perrysburg or Los Angeles or Orinda with a large checkbook.andP;  Iexpect any of these companies to sell out--for the right price.andM;I also expect the acquired company to be operated as a reasonably independentsubsidiary, or fail.andP;  Without the talents of Dave Fulton and the FoxPro team,or Brian Russell and the Clipper makers, what would Fox or Nantucket beworth?andM;What about application developers?andP;  What does it all mean?andP;  It means nothingis constant except change.andP;  It means as soon as you become an expert atsomething you're obsolete.andP;  Mostly, it means flexibility is the key tosurvival.andP;  So keep one eye on the ball and one eye down field.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
