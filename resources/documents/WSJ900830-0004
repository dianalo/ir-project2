Ten of the 13 members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries agreed to raise output immediately tohelp replace the four million barrels of oil taken off themarket because of the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti petroleum.Market estimates varied as to how much oil OPEC could quicklyput on the market.</LP><TEXT>   Crude oil for October delivery fell $1.96 a barrel to$25.92 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest levelin nearly three weeks. So far this week the contract hasdropped about $5 a barrel, or 16%, as financial marketsincreasingly believe the chances for Mideast hostilities havelessened.   &quot;The crude market weakened on perceptions of a moderatingPersian Gulf crisis,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, a crude oil analystwith E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc. He said a numberof news reports pointed to the &quot;potential for a peacefulsolution.&quot;   A number of traders said Iraq's promise to release womenand children held hostage, followed quickly by praise fromthe U.S. government for the move, was one sign of easingtensions. Market participants also pointed to reports thatIraq had made behind-the-scenes peace overtures to the U.S.   And in a market looking to go lower, even news that wasseveral days old was cited as a factor, such as the plannedmeeting between the U.N. Secretary General and Iraq's foreignminister, scheduled for today.   Among OPEC members, the country that has sizable sparecapacity that could ratchet up production quickly is SaudiArabia. Traders were expecting that country to produce anextra two million barrels a day, with enough output fromother OPEC nations to replace a total of three million to 3.5million of the lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti production.   But some reports on the New York Merc said Saudi Arabiaalready was producing an extra two million barrels a day andcould produce one million beyond that by the end of the year,for a total output as high as 8.5 million barrels daily. Somepeople remained skeptical, however. &quot;They've been working onprojects to upgrade production capacity, but 8.5 million is avery high number,&quot; Mr. Lebow said.   Gasoline prices also were off yesterday, in sympathy withcrude declines. Gasoline for September delivery finished at84.72 cents a gallon, down 3.81.   Heating oil fell sharply, with the September contract down7.88 cents a gallon to 71.64 cents. A sharp buildup ininventories reported Tuesday afternoon by the AmericanPetroleum Institute depressed prices. &quot;Heating oil seems tobe in adequate supply right now,&quot; one trader said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of many corn, wheat andsoybean futures contracts sank for the third consecutive dayin the absence of any threatening developments in the MiddleEast. Last week, grain prices rose on speculation that anyprolonged climb in oil prices would enable oil-producingnations to import more U.S. grain. &quot;The market is taking outthe war premium,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vicepresident at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago. Crop prices arealso being depressed by good growing weather in the Midwest.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices eased. The October contract was off0.42 cent a pound at 11.05 cents and dropped at one pointbelow 11 cents. According to one analyst, the drop was adelayed reaction to the softness that has hit many commoditymarkets as fears of a war in the Middle East have eased.There are no new developments concerning the current sugarbeet crop in Europe, the analyst said. Moderate but steadydemand for sugar in the world market from Mideast countrieshas been curtailed by the crisis in that area, the analystsaid.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Most futures contracts dropped their dailypermissible limits. Contract months from November forwarddeclined their daily limit of five cents a pound; Novemberended at $1.5330. The soon-to-expire September contract,which can rise or fall as much as 10 cents a pound from itsprevious close, was down as much as eight cents a pound atone point before partially recovering to end 5.95 cents lowerat $1.6345. Contributing to selling in the September contractis the fact that Tuesday will be the first day on whichnotices will be issued to deliver the concentrate againstSeptember futures, an analyst said. Concentrate prices havebeen under pressure because retail demand has slowed in theface of price advances caused by damage to the Florida citruscrop by last December's freeze. The lower prices might helpto revive some consumer demand, the analyst said. However,supply concerns have been alleviated by abetter-than-expected crop this year in Florida andexpectations that new-crop Brazilian supplies will soon beavailable, which could create further pressure on prices, theanalyst said.   COCOA: Futures prices declined. The December contract wasoff $31 a metric ton to $1,249. Analysts followingfundamentals said that rain in the Ivory Coast has easedfears that recent dryness would hurt the crop, although oneanalyst said the rains were light and scattered and weren't amajor factor. &quot;The market fell back because there was littlereason for it to have advanced in the first place,&quot; she said.John Gambino, a senior futures technical analyst for MerrillLynch, said that on a purely technical basis, the drop in theDecember contract to $1,100 a ton in mid-August from $1,560in May was simply a correction of the market's rally from$960 to $1,560 between last December and May. Now, Mr.Gambino said, &quot;Prices may have bottomed out and could besetting the stage for the renewal of the bull move.&quot; Thedownward trend, he said, &quot;fits into a classic three-wavecorrection&quot; that he now believes is complete. According tothat scenario, he said, the recent low of $1,100 &quot;marks theresumption of the bull market that began last December.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
