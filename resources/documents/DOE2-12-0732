<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0732 </DOCNO><TEXT>This publication contains 50-year committed dose equivalent factors, intabular form. The document is intended to be used as the primary referenceby the US Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors for calculatingradiation dose equivalents for members of the public, resulting fromingestion or inhalation of radioactive materials. Its application isintended specifically for such materials released to the environmentduring routine DOE operations, except in those instances where compliancewith 40 CFR 61 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants)requires otherwise. However, the calculated values may be equally applicableto unusual releases or to occupational exposures. The use of these committeddose equivalent tables should ensure that doses to members of the publicfrom internal exposures are calculated in a consistent manner at allDOE facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
