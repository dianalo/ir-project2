(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voyager 2 brushed by Neptune's north poleand photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty,fault-cracked Triton, revealing ``a world unlike any we've everseen,'' NASA said Friday.   ``All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solarsystem,'' said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom,deputy leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.   The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile,12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles overNeptune's north pole Thursday night, then dove past Triton, theplanet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900miles above the moon's surface at 2:10 a.m PDT Friday.   ``We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of American spacetechnology,'' Vice President Dan Quayle told hundreds of scientistsand dignitaries Friday at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I am exceedinglydelighted to be here on this very historic day for America andAmerica's space program.''   During its approach to Neptune, Voyager discovered six moons inaddition to Nereid and frost-covered Triton, which were firstobserved from Earth.   The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris aroundthe planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe willalso prove to be a complete ring.   Voyager's closest photos of Triton were recorded on tape forplayback to earth this weekend, but those returned Friday astoundedscientists. Soderblom said they showed at least three volcanoes, nowinactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozennatural gas or nitrogen ice.   ``The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike anywe've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone.   While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have beenseen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some other moons, ``it's the firsttime we've seen an icy volcano,'' Stone said, referring to one ofthe huge craters on Triton. ``This is a real volcano.''   But Stone noted that Triton's volcanoes are ``filled with iceinstead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.''   NASA geologist Joseph Boyce said one of the ice volcanoes _ whichlook like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measuresseveral hundred miles across.   Other Triton photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lyingcliffs and ``ice structures of various sorts, like glacierterrain,'' JPL scientist Torrence Johnson said. ``They're likethings you see in polar caps on Mars.''   ``It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over theplace,'' Soderblom said, adding that the faults suggest``Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon.   Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets ofparallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy ``eruptedplastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleysor erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is``using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,''Soderblom said.   He said scientists don't yet know the makeup of the volcanic icesand other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted.   Earth and Jupiter's moon Io are the only objects in the solarsystem known to have volcanoes that are currently active.   Voyager also revealed Triton has an atmosphere, as predicted.It's content wasn't immediately determined, but NASA said the hazemight be like photochemical smog.   Stone said the discovery that Triton's surface once wasgeologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbitingmoon _ about four-fifths the size of Earth's moon _ once was acomet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around Neptune.   Under that theory, Triton initially would have orbited Neptune ina long ellipse, but Neptune's gravity slowly pulled it into acircular orbit, making Triton a semi-molten, geologically activeball for the first billion years after its capture, he said.   By 9 a.m. PDT Saturday, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles fromEarth and 1.385 million miles from Neptune, speeding away from thegiant planet at 37,847 mph.   The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in Neptune's bluishatmosphere, as well as cloud ``streamers'' stretching thousands ofmiles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclonecalled the Great Dark Spot.   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979,Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its trip to Neptune followed a4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75billion miles from Earth.   Voyager 1 also was launched in 1977, exploring Jupiter in 1979and Saturn in 1980 before speeding out of the plane of the planets.   Until its official ``near encounter'' period ends Oct. 2, Voyager2 will look back over its shoulder at Neptune. Then it, like Voyager1, will head toward interstellar space.   ``Voyager 2 is now past Neptune and is continuing to pressoutward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,''NASA administrator Richard Truly said. ``The Voyagers are destinedto wander through the Milky Way. ... What wonders they willencounter.''   Lennard Fisk, an associate administrator of NASA, called theclimax of the Voyager mission historic because ``it's the last timewe're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed thereconnaissance of the planets, except Pluto.''</TEXT></DOC>
