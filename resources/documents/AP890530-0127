Curran ruled in favor of the GeneralElectric Co. while owning GE stock.   The U.S. Code of Judicial Ethics forbids a judge from presidingin a case in which he has a financial holding.   The Associated Press discovered the incidents by reviewingCurran's financial disclosure statements and cross-referencing hisstock holdings with his case files.   In a telephone interview from Chicago, Appeals Judge William J.Bauer said he had decided to begin a formal review after taking a``cursory look'' at the AP finding. He said he would probe bothcases closely and then announce whether any action should be taken.Federal statutes require confidentiality until formal action istaken, Bauer said.   Curran was on the bench Tuesday and could not be reached forcomment.   In an interview Friday, Curran said he would ``notify counsel ofthe existence of the conflicting interest'' and avoid futureinvolvement in cases involving GE.   Judge Robert W. Warren, chief judge of the Eastern Wisconsindistrict in Milwaukee, said Curran's ruling in GE cases apparently``slipped through the cracks'' of a system designed to catch suchconflicts.   ``Judge Curran, when he found out about this, has filed an orderrecusing himself. ... It's not the kind of thing that we're happyabout. It will be repaired,'' Warren said.   Curran reported in all his disclosure statements since 1985 thathe held between $15,000 and $50,000 in GE stock. He presided overunrelated cases involving GE Medical Systems in 1987 and 1989 andsaid in an interview that he was surprised to learn of theconflicts.   ``I really thought we had a system to prevent that,'' Curransaid. He said in accepting the cases, he hadn't recognized GEMedical Systems as a ``subsidiary'' of GE. Actually, GE MedicalSystems is a division of the parent company, and in one caseCurran's ruling directly cited General Electric Co. as thedefendant.   ``I couldn't dispute that,'' said Curran.   Bauer originally reviewed the AP's findings without knowing thejudge's name and said the cases appeared to violate the U.S. Code.Bauer is responsible for enforcing the judicial code of ethics onall judges in his territory, which includes Wisconsin.   ``The code is fairly clear,'' he said. ``If you have a financialinterest you must disqualify yourself.''   University of Wisconsin law professor Frank Tuerkheimer, aformer U.S. attorney, said possible action against the judge couldrange from a reprimand to impeachment, but the latter was ``highlyunlikely.'' He said neither suit was large enough to affect thejudge's investments, ``but the case law is clear that that does notmatter.''   Curran, 64, is a former Mauston, Wis., attorney who wasappointed to the bench in 1983 by then-President Reagan. His 1988disclosure showed net investments between $648,030 and $1,720,000,generally in blue-chip stocks. His investments returned between$37,147 and $112,116, including between $1,001 and $2,500 in GEdividends.   Curran's first case involving GE stemmed from a 1983 lawsuitfiled by a union representing Robert Holloway. The union contendedHolloway was unfairly denied a promotion at the GE Medical Systemsplant in West Milwaukee. There was a one-day trial in 1984, andCurran dismissed the lawsuit June 5, 1987.   His ruling listed General Electric Co. as the defendant.   In the more recent case, Joseph Toth, another GE Medical Systemsemployee, sued in 1988 contending he was unfairly fired for missingwork because of a health problem. On April 25, 1989, Curran deniedToth's request for a trial, issuing a summary judgment dismissingthe lawsuit.   The Toth case listed General Electric Medical Systems as thedefendant.   ``You try to keep track of these subsidiaries,'' Curran said.``Apparently in this case we didn't.''   He added: ``Having been alerted, we will notify counsel of theexistence of the conflicting interest and recuse myself so I wouldnot be in a position to pass judgment upon anything further withGE.''   William E. Wentzel, who represented Toth, said Tuesday: ``I'mcertainly going to do something, whatever it takes to get the casereopened.''   Wentzel said he and the lawyer representing GE filed a jointdocument in the Toth case prior to their first pre-trial hearing.The summary of issues identified GE as the defendent, but Currannever disclosed his holding, he said.   Matthew R. Robbins, whose firm represented Holloway, said hewould contact his client, ``but I would have to suspect that pastdue time would make an appeal unlikely.''   Robbins said the discovery indicated a problem lawyers ``are notaware of. You normally do not know ... the judges' financialholdings.''   George K. Whyte Jr., whose law firm represented GE in theHolloway matter, said he could not recall the case. Mary PatNinneman, who represented GE in the Toth case, did not returnseveral phone messages.   Title 28 of the U.S. Code, section 455, requires that a judgedisqualify himself when ``he knows that he, individually or as afiduciary, or his spouse or his minor child residing in hishousehold, has a financial interest in the subject matter incontroversy or in a party to the proceeding.''   The code defines financial interest as ``ownership of a legal orequitable interest, however small.''   Judge Warren said his district court has a ``certificate ofinterest'' system designed to identify possible conflicts.   ``The certificate does not always work because the defendant'scertificate isn't filed until after the case is assigned. .... Thisapplication just slipped through the cracks.''   ``About all I can say is it's unfortunate if it happened, but itdoes happen because judges can't keep track of all their holdingsand their relationships to subsidiaries in this day and age.''</TEXT></DOC>
