(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trampling deaths and suffocations of 73people on Christmas Eve remain a touchy subject in this town, eventhough the tragedy occurred 75 years old today.   ``I don't suppose it will ever heal,'' said amateur historianJack Foster, a resident of Calumet.   It happened when a false fire alarm was sounded during a partyfor children in 1913, at the height of a bitter strike at coppermines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.   ``The death certificates blame persons unknown and some of thestories are so insidious that I understand why over the years peoplein the town didn't want to talk about it,'' said Peggy Germain, aformer Calumet council member.   Even so, the town council voted Tuesday to hold a memorialservice today at the site where the hall once stood. Planned are anon-denominational prayer service, a candlelight vigil, and thereading of the victims' names.   Nobody ever discovered who sounded the false alarm, Foster said.Union and company supporters blamed each other for the strikeviolence they attributed to the disaster.   Unionized members of the Western Federation of Miners had been onstrike for 10 months over the Calumet and Hecla Mining Co.'sdecision to switch from two-man drills to one-man drills. The WFMcontended the new drill was unsafe.   In June 1913, more than 14,000 unionized miners and 1,500 milland smelter workers were laid off as Calumet and Hecla moved toreopen its mines with non-union workers, according to an account byhistorian Angus Murdock.   That fall, two company guards chased a striker into a boardinghouse in Calumet and fired gunshots, killing two men. The guardsclaimed they had been shot at first.   Then on Dec. 7, three non-union Canadian miners were gunned downas they slept in a second boarding house. Days later, a miner and aguard were killed in another shootout.   It was in that atmosphere that the WFM women's committee held aChristmas party for the children of striking miners on the secondfloor of Calumet's Italian Hall, above a saloon.   The party was under way, witnesses said, when someone from thefirst floor stairwell shouted out a fire alarm.   Children and adults panicked to escape, tripping over each otherto get into the stairwell and out the only exit. Witnesses said 57children and 16 adults were crushed to death or suffocated beforeanyone realized what was happening.   ``I was so scared,'' said Lena Rigotti, an 88-year-old Hurley,Wis., nursing home resident who survived the tragedy. ``I told mysister, `Stay with me and we'll get home.' I don't know how we evermade it.'''   National Guard troops were ordered out to keep the peace, and acongressional investigation was held. The WFM called a halt to thestrike that next spring.</TEXT></DOC>
