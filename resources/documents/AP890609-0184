Human rights were unmentioned in a White House statement aboutthe meeting. Bush had been urged in letters from members of Congressand rights activists to raise the issue with Suharto and to pressfor outside human rights observers to enter Indonesia.   At the end of the half-hour visit, Suharto's party left the WhiteHouse by a rear exit, abandoning earlier arrangements for theIndonesian president to talk to the press.   On Cambodia, Bush ``reaffirmed the need for a comprehensivesettlement including verified withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops,prevention of Khmer Rouge return to power and self-determination forthe Cambodian people,'' the White House said.   He also ``reiterated the U.S. economic and military role in thedevelopment of Southeast Asia,'' it added.   Meanwhile, the World Bank announced a $350 million loan Friday toIndonesia to help finance imports while the government pursueseconomic reform. The announcement included an endorsement of changesSuharto has instituted, saying there has already been ``a resurgenceof investment and economic recovery.''   Vice President Dan Quayle visited Jakarta at the end of April,discussed human rights issues with government officials and metthree rights activists.   A letter to Bush from Asia Watch, a private rights monitoringorganization, praised the Quayle visit but added that the vicepresident's ``gesture'' on human rights was later weakened becauseQuayle ``seemed to equate President Suharto's economicachievements'' with human rights protection.   Another letter to Bush this week from 118 members of the House ofRepresentatives said ``Severe violations of human rights, includingexecutions, rape and beatings are a recurring problem'' in EastTimor, the former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in1975-1976.   Since then, more than 100,000 of East Timor's former populationof 700,000 have died from military action, starvation or disease,the congressional letter said.</TEXT></DOC>
