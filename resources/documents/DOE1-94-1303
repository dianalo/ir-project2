<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-94-1303 </DOCNO><TEXT>The basic heating requirement for the Kullaskogen residential area inVaxholm is met by heat pumps abstracting heat from purified sewage effluentfrom the Blynaes sewage treatment plant. The effluent is pumped fromthe treatment plant to the heating plant through a 1.5 km long pipe,most of which is laid on the bed of a lake. The residential area consistsof about 150 dwelling units, with a total residential area of about 13,000m/sup 2/, and made up of detached houses, semi-detached houses and apartmentbuildings. Total power demand has been calculated as amounting to about700 kW and annual energy demand to 1.9 GWh. The heating system has beendesigned to operate at a low temperature of 60/40 degrees C. Three electricallydriven heat pumps have been installed. The heat pumps meet the base loadheat requirement, with any additional heat being supplied by electricboilers. The heat pumps have supplied 70% of the annual heating energyrequirement. The annual coefficient of performance of the heat pumpsis 2.3 referred to the overall power consumption. During the year, atotal of 1.9 GWh was supplied to the heat distribution system, and 1.2GWh of electricity were purchased. This gives a total annual coefficientof performance of the entire heating plant of 1.6. (authors).</TEXT></DOC>
