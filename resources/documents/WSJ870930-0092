He formed some of President Reagan's wealthy backers into a group he called We the People, announced a budget of $2.5 million, and began asking for money from rich people and corporations.    But We the People flopped. It hasn't produced one pro-Bork television or radio ad.    Money flowed instead to the anti-Bork forces. Anti-Bork ads, narrated by actor Gregory Peck, aired in 22 states and Washington, D.C., prompting White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater to complain that they distorted Judge Bork's record. Another ad is being filmed today in Texas, featuring former Texas Rep. Barbara Jordan, who says she wouldn't have been elected if Mr. Bork's views on voting-rights laws had prevailed. The new anti-Bork ad also is aimed at states of undecided senators.    Pro-Bork partisans say corporations won't give. &quot;They're really afraid of this whole area,&quot; laments California venture capitalist Richard Riordan, We the People's chief fund-raiser. &quot;The way things are going, we'll raise about $500,000,&quot; he says. The largest donation so far is $10,000, from Mr. Riordan himself. &quot;It's really depressing to fail at something like this,&quot; he says.    Lack of money hasn't stopped pro-Bork forces by any means. The Senate is being flooded with telephone calls and letters on both sides of the issue, with much of the pro-Bork appeals stimulated by conservative Christian groups and Republican-leaning organizations supporting the nomination.    But for a broad range of liberal groups, including pro-abortion and civil rights organizations, the anti-Bork campaign has become a bonanza. It's a change from the 1980 elections, when conservative political action committees spent millions attacking liberal senators with splashy TV ads.    Then, liberals said free-spending ideological groups were buying too much influence. Now it's the conservatives who are complaining.    &quot;What this has boiled down to is that the left is trying to buy a Supreme Court seat&quot; by putting off any confirmation until a new administration takes office, says pro-Bork strategist Daniel Casey of the Free Congress Foundation. &quot;They are doing this directly, with a multimillion-dollar media campaign in these (targeted) states that we can't come close to matching, and won't.&quot;    The anti-Bork blitz is focused on senators who haven't declared which way they will vote. The biggest spender is People for the American Way, a liberal group founded by Hollywood producer Norman Lear in opposition to the conservative political movement among evangelical and fundamentalist Christian groups.    People for the American Way now claims 270,000 members and says it has sent four million letters appealing for money to defeat Bork. It expects to add 40,000 new donors to its lists before the fight is over. At first it said it would spend $1 million fighting the nomination, but now says it will manage $2 million. Conservatives suspect it is actually spending much more.    People for the American Way volunteers, using a dozen telephone lines at the group's Washington headquarters, this week will be urging members in Alabama, Arizona and Pennsylvania to contact Sens. Howell Heflin (D., Ala.), Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) and Arlen Specter (R., Pa.). Those three are undecided members of the Judiciary Committee, which is expected to vote on the nomination next week.    Previously, the group sent 15,000 postcards to members in the same three states, plus Georgia, West Virginia and Florida, urging members to call their senators. As an alternative, members could call a toll-free number, ask for Western Union's &quot;Hotline operator No. 9222,&quot; and send an anti-Bork message to their senator for $4.50. Members had a choice of five messages already prepared by People for the American Way, if they didn't want to bother composing their own. More than 700 such messages were sent.    At the Capitol, mail clerks and telephone operators are working overtime. Some senators say they haven't seen such volume since conservatives mounted an attack on Jimmy Carter's treaty ceding U.S. ownership of the Panama Canal. AFL-CIO unions, pro-abortion groups, civil rights groups and even environmentalists, who haven't weighed in on judicial nominations before, are mobilizing members on a grand scale.    At the office of Sen. Heflin, whose eventual decision could influence other undecided Southern Democrats, aides counted 21,000 pieces of mail. &quot;It's all artificial, most of it,&quot; says press aide Jerry Ray. He periodically plunges his hand into the day's mailbag and samples what he finds. On one typical day last week, he came up with 64 letters on the Bork fight. Sixty were from out of state, and of the four Alabama writers, two were for and two against. A few weeks ago, however, the mail had been running overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Bork.    A considerable volume of pro-Bork calls and letters have been stirred up by conservative Christian groups. Last week switchboards in the office of Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont were jammed for two days after a White House lobbyist appeared on a syndicated radio program, &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; which claims to be carried by 1,400 Christian radio stations.    The show's host urged listeners to call the Capitol and register opinions with Judiciary Committee members. &quot;There was a telephone call every 15 seconds,&quot; says Joe Jamele, Sen. Leahy's press secretary. &quot;They were all pro-Bork, there were thousands and thousands of calls. It must have been 900 to one.&quot;    But such out-of-state calls carry little weight. Sen. Leahy's Vermont mail is still running three-to-two against confirmation, the press aide says. Other Senate aides say many pro-Bork callers often seem badly uninformed, confused about the spelling of his name or even the office to which he aspires. Anti-Bork partisans come off as better informed and better able to mobilize the constituents of undecided senators.    Conservative groups simply haven't been able to match the passion of the anti-Bork campaign. &quot;We're getting blown out of the water,&quot; says Jeffery Troutt, research director of the conservative Institute for Government and Politics.    For liberal groups, Judge Bork represents a political bogeyman, just the thing for getting direct-mail donors to reach for their checkbooks. But Mr. Troutt says conservatives have found that &quot;It's hard to raise money for judicial restraint.&quot;    &quot;If we had the money, believe me, you'd be seeing TV ads, radio, newspaper ads, everything,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's just not there.&quot;    Late yesterday, pro-Bork forces scraped up $2,000 to run a day's worth of radio ads in Arizona and West Virginia, urging Sen. DeConcini and Sen. Robert Byrd to &quot;stand tall&quot; against &quot;liberal special-interest groups&quot; by voting to approve the nomination. The ads were paid for by the American Conservative Union and an affiliate. </TEXT></DOC>
