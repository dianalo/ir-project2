Dominating debate at the two-week meeting of 39 nations thatends Friday is the issue of mining: whether the vast continentshould be left a beautiful unspoiled wilderness or exploited forits potential mineral wealths.   French oceanographer and explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, whocollected 1.5 million signatures on a petition favoring anAntarctic wilderness preserve, accused Washington officials of``wasting their time defending a lost cause.''   The United States, Britain and New Zealand want a meeting towork out details of accident liability under an internationalminerals convention that would open Antarctica to regulated miningand replace the existing voluntary moratorium on mining.   The convention, worked out after six years of tough negotiation,was initialed in June 1988 in Wellington, New Zealand.   The United States says the convention is the best way to protectAntarctica, and a member of the U.S. delegation who spoke oncondition of anonymity said negotiations were proceeding smoothly.   ``Nobody here wants to go home without an agreement,'' he said.   But Australia and France say mining and environmental protectionare like oil and icy waters _ they don't mix. Both countries haverefused to sign the mineral convention, effectively stopping it,and they have been joined in the last few weeks by Italy, Belgium,India, Greece, Austria and Bulgaria.   Australia and France want a meeting dedicated to discussing anambitious proposal to declare Antarctica a ``wilderness park''where mining would be prohibited and human activity carefullycontrolled.   ``The meeting has made very little progress since the UnitedStates, the U.K. and a couple of others had refused to stop pushingthe minerals convention,'' said an environmentalist with observerstatus to the conference. ``We could end up without any agreementat all. It would be tragic.''   The minerals convention does not assign responsiblity forcleaning up and paying damages in the event of accident.   The Argentine ship Bahia Paraiso ran around and sank near theU.S. Palmer Station in January, spilling 70,000 gallons of dieselfuel into one of the most delicate ecosystems in the world.Argentina, Chile and the United States cooperated on the cleanup,but the ship continues to leak.   To date, no one has assumed responsiblity for plugging the leak,or for the damage done to 22 years of American research measuringAntarctica's unpolluted environment against global pollution levels.
