All were charged with accepting bribes and other favors in 1984 and 1985 in return for helping Systematic Recovery Services Ltd., a closely held New York collection company, obtain contracts from Chicago and Cook County to collect parking fines, overdue water bills and outstanding bills for other municipal services.    The company wasn't charged in the indictments.    The indictments stem from a long-running undercover investigation into municipal corruption in Chicago and New York. Last November, the grand jury here indicted seven people, five of whom have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty. Two others are awaiting trial.    At a news conference here yesterday, U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas said several of the latest group of those indicted had been charged with wire fraud relating to televised news interviews they gave criticizing competitors of Systematic Recovery. Mr. Valukas said that although the grand jury had indicted Clarence McClain, 45 years old, a former aide and close adviser to Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, the mayor wasn't a target of the 18-month undercover investigation.    In addition to Mr. McClain, those indicted are: Marian Humes, 52, and Perry Hutchinson, 43, both former Chicago aldermen; Morgan M. Finley, 61, the clerk of the Cook County Circuit Court, and his chief investigator, Michael Lambesis, 62. The indictment also named John Adams, 32, a former city revenue department official, and Melvin G. DuBrock, 53, a former city sanitation department official, along with Charles Knox, 42, and David Hammond, 44, both officials of an unaccredited Chicago law school.    Mr. Adams said he wasn't guilty of any of the charges. A spokesman for Mr. Lambesis declined comment. None of the others could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
