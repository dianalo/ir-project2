Wholesale prices fell 0.2 percent in February, the LaborDepartment said as it released its monthly Producer Price Index.   Food prices fell 1.1 percent and energy prices declined 0.8percent, the department said.   For the first two months of 1988, prices rose at an annual rateof 1.1 percent, half the modest 2.2 percent rate for all of lastyear. Prices rose 0.4 percent in January after a 0.4 percentdecline in December.   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6percent in February. The increase was generally in line withexpectations.   The government also revised its January retail sales report toshow a small decline of 0.2 percent instead of an originallyreported increase of 0.5 percent.   Even with the January decline, analysts said the sales reportgenerally reflected that the October stock market crash has hadlittle effect on consumer buying plans.   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of overalleconomic activity, any significant faltering in this area couldtopple the country into a recession.   On Thursday, nervousness over Wall Street's strength yanked downstock prices, but pessimism disappeared in the energy markets,where oil futures rose sharply over expectations that OPEC willtake steps to avert another 1986-style price collapse.   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 48.24 pointsto 2,026.03, its largest loss since falling 57.20 on Jan. 20.Broader market indicators also declined.   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 3 to 1 on theNew York Stock Exchange, and the Wilshire 5000 Equity Indexmeasuring the value of 5,000 U.S. stocks fell nearly $40 billion.   Analysts said the selloff reflected continued anxiety about theaftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash, which persistently hasundermined investor confidence.   The mood contrasted sharply with a buying spree on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, where contracts for April delivery of WestTexas Intermediate, the main U.S. crude, rose 51 cents to close at$16.00 a barrel. Refined products traded on the exchange also rosesharply.   Petroleum analysts linked the oil rally to reports that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ aware it can'tsustain relentless price discounting and excessive output _ willshave 5 percent off the production of all members except Iraq,which has resisted cartel discipline.   The reports reflected hopes that after three months of priceerosion reminiscent of the cataclysmic market plunge two years ago,OPEC and non-OPEC producers were taking steps to avoid anotheruncontrollable drop.   Since January, prices for Persian Gulf oil have fallen as low as$13 per 42-gallon barrel, compared with OPEC's official price of$18. West Texas Intermediate has dropped from about $18 to as lowas $15.   In other financial markets, gold prices rose sharply in reactionto the sudden strength in the oil market, which could portendhigher inflation. Gold is considered a good hedge against risingprices.   In the bond market, a barometer of interest rate trends, pricesfell in reaction to higher oil and metal prices. The Treasury's30-year issue fell $5 per $1,000 in face amount and its yield rosefrom 8.51 percent to 8.55 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
