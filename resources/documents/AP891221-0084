Military tanks rolled through the city and formed a circlearound several thousand mostly young people at a main intersectionin an effort to control the burgeoning unrest, said a Yugoslavreporter.   A Soviet news report from Bucharest said, ``Along the centralstreet of the capital, tanks are moving, following the lines ofsubmachine gunners pushing back the crowds. Bursts of automaticweapons fire are being heard. Panic-stricken people are hiding indoorways and courtyards.''   The unrest was the first reported in the capital sincedemonstrations against the hard-line president, Nicolae Ceausescu,broke out over the weekend on the other side of the country in thecity of Timisoara.   There were chilling reports by Yugoslav media that soldiers andpolice who refused to shoot at demonstrators in Timisoara werepublicly executed. And Tass said workers occupied businesses in thewestern city today and threatened to blow them up if demands for anew government were not met.   Hungarian radio said the Romanian Communist Party's rulingPolitburo was meeting in an unannounced session, which was likelyto discuss measures to curb the unrest. It said some protesterschanted, ``The army is with us!''   The unrest is the biggest challenge to Ceausescu's 24-year-longauthoritarian rule and reportedly has spread to a dozen cities.Access to the country by foreign reporters is strictly curtailed,but witnesses have said hundreds and perhaps thousands of peoplehave been killed.   Shots were also reported fired today at protesters in the cityof Arad, about 40 miles from Timisoara. There was no immediate wordon casualties there. Security forces first used tear gas to try toquell protests in Bucharest, a reporter for the Yugoslav newsagency Tanjug said on Belgrade radio.   The protest turned into ``bloody riots'' as police fired intocrowds and killed and wounded several people, the correspondentsaid. The number of casualties was not known.   The Yugoslav journalist, Petar Tomic of Yugoslavia's state-runTanjug news agency, said an armoured vehicle crushed two students.Other students rushed to their aid and security forces opened fire,killing or wounding around 20 people, Tomic said.      The Western diplomat reported seeing at least four ambulances inthe city center shortly after the protests began.   Tass reported ``a great many'' fire trucks and military vehiclesin the center of the city and said all approaches to thePresidential Palace and Communist Party headquarters were blockedby army units.   ``The crowd of protesters, which first numbered a few hundred,has now increased to several thousand,'' it reported. ``Thosegathered in the square are shouting the slogans `Freedom!' `Downwith dictatorship!' They are stopping buses and cars.''   Security forces also fired on protesters during a general strikein Arad, according to Klaus Lanz, a spokesman for ethnic GermanRomanians based in Munich.   A Romanian who arrived in Yugoslavia today from Timisoara saidthat city was in the second day of a general strike. Asking that henot be identified, he told reporters at the border he had heardreports of demonstrations today in the southern city of Craiova andin Suceava in the north.   Tass said factories in Timisoara were closed and occupied byworkers who demanded that the government resign, the military leavethe city, and leaders be called to account for the loss of lives inthe city.   ``According to the latest information, the military units havestarted to leave,'' Tass said.   In East Germany today, the government recalled its ambassadorfrom Bucharest, and Czechoslovakia issued a formal protest asEuropean nations formed a united front to condemn the repression.   President Francois Mitterrand of France said Ceausescu's daysare numbered and called for his replacement. But he ruled outforeign intervention to topple Ceausescu, who has refused to adoptthe reforms accepted in other East bloc countries.   Elsewhere in the East bloc today:   _The Czechoslovak Communist Party voted to immediately disbandthe hated paramilitary People's Militia, which was used to helpcrush dissent, a day after publicly apologizing for its hard-linepolicies of the past.   _Hungary's Parliament paved the way for free elections next yearby voting to dissolve itself in March.   The Western diplomat in Bucharest, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said by telephone that Ceausescu was interrupted todayat an official rally called to support his tough stance againstprotesters.   The speech was broadcast on radio and television. When shoutserupted, the broadcast abruptly switched to patriotic music forabout three minutes. It then then resumed with Ceausescu inmid-sentence.   As Ceausescu returned to the air waves, people were heard loudlyapplauding his promises of a higher minimum wage, increasedallowances for families with children, and other benefitsapparently intended to quell discontent, the diplomat said.   But protesters then marched through the streets of Bucharestshouting anti-Ceausescu slogans, the source said. Hungarian radiosaid people burned banners they were issued for the pro-Ceausescurally.   Witnesses say hundreds, possibly thousands, of unarmed peoplewere shot to death in Timisoara on Saturday and Sunday whileprotesting Ceausescu.   The 71-year-old president declared a state of emergency in theTimisoara region Wednesday after tens of thousands of peoplechanting ``Give us our dead!' reportedly protested.   The Belgrade daily Politika quoted witnesses Wednesday as sayingthey saw two soldiers and an officer killed ``on the spot'' bysecurity agents after refusing to fire on anti-governmentdemonstrators.   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that a group of Syrianstudents arriving in Yugoslavia this morning from Timisoara saiddemonstrations were still going on in the city during the night.   A resident of Timisoara told Hungarian television that 80,000 to90,000 people took part.   Breaking his silence on the unrest Wednesday, Ceausescu blamedthe protests on ``hooligans'' incited by ``a brazen campaign ofslander and lies'' from abroad, especially Hungary.   He has been accused by Budapest of persecuting ethnicHungarians, who are concentrated in the Transylvanian region thatincludes Timisoara.</TEXT></DOC>
