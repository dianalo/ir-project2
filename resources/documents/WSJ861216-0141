European parties of the left participate in the Socialist International, which had the initial purpose of promoting social democracy, but Democratic socialists mainly keep themselves closeted inside the party's basically capitalist framework.    In foreign affairs, the European far left has been so virulently anti-American the past 20 years that few left-wing Democrats could risk formally associating their politics with the Europeans. But both have been in the news recently sharing pieces of the same general attitude toward East-West relations.    Last week the House Democratic caucus voted to use the appropriations process to hold the U.S. to the nuclear ceilings set in the never-ratified SALT II treaty. More revealing were the strategic-policy amendments Democrats embedded last September in the House's $562 billion omnibus spending bill.    In addition to using appropriations to &quot;ratify&quot; SALT II, the House's Democratic left wing would have halted virtually all underground nuclear tests and banned space-testing of an anti-satellite missile. Other measures tried to stop money for new chemical weapons and severely cut back the president's spending request for the Strategic Defense Initiative. Currently, House Democrats, now guided by Speaker Jim Wright, are talking about shutting down the anti-communist contra operation in Nicaragua.    Meanwhile, the out-of-power Social Democratic Party of West Germany has just proposed the creation of a 186-mile-wide nuclear-free &quot;corridor&quot; between East and West Germany. The SDP recently signed such an agreement with the Communist Party that runs East Germany, patterned after a similar &quot;agreement&quot; to create a chemical-weapons-free zone. Ultimately the SDP would like such a corridor to extend from Norway and Sweden down to Austria.    In Britain, the out-of-power Labor Party is talking about ridding the country of its own nuclear weapons. It also wants the U.S. to remove its nuclear weapons and has proposed repudiating the U.S. nuclear guarantee of its security.    Several weeks ago Canada's out-of-power Liberal Party voted to declare the entire country a nuclear-free zone. And of course New Zealand's Labor Party shut its ports to U.S. nuclear vessels after it got into office.    Mikhail Gorbachev has been showing a nice, friendly smile during his tours around the West, but that somehow doesn't seem a sufficient explanation for the eagerness of all these left-liberal parties in 1986 to reach for the sky. Their positions seem all the more curious when one considers that most of these soft policy positions are likely to prevent their return to power rather than enhance it. The answer lies with William Butler Yeats: The center hasn't held.    In the U.S., Britain, West Germany and Canada the left of center has collapsed. Their economic policies were bringing the West to stagnation and ruin, and they were voted out of office and replaced by pro-market, conservative governments. (Interestingly, these conservative governments have been joined by nominally socialist leaders in Spain, Portugal and Austria who are in some ways even more aggressively pro-market.) In short, the far left has come to prominence, if not power, by subtraction in the U.S., Britain and West Germany.    There is no cause for comfort in this. If the currently sitting governments of the three major NATO powers should fall from power by accident or ineptitude, their successors could be leaders more than eager to negotiate their strategic ideas into laws pleasing to Mr. Gorbachev.    This dangerous state of affairs will be tough to change in Britain or Germany, where out-of-power policy has become a basket case. The most interesting game in the global village remains the U.S. Democrats.    The centrist Democratic Leadership Council (Sam Nunn, Chuck Robb, Bruce Babbitt, Bob Graham and the like) has just emerged from a buoyant conference in Williamsburg, Va. At this point, it is in no sense clear to us that this group will prevail over the foreign-policy impulses in the Democratic House. That faction is well positioned to promote and publicize its agenda legislatively. If by 1988 the Democrats have pulled the plug on the contras, hobbled SDI and &quot;ratified&quot; SALT II, the party will be well along to joining its counterparts across the Atlantic -- rolling to the left and no longer an opposition that can be counted on to defend democracy, social or otherwise. </TEXT></DOC>
