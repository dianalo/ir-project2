Has spring training lost its innocence?I leave these prickly questions to others.;    When I come down here in March,I'm more worried about how long the beer lines are, whether my tan will becomea burn and how long the stars are going to stay in the game.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ON DECK: A CACTUS LEAGUE PRIMER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Destination: ArizonaSee also related story on P. 15T of this sectionAdditional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     Coming to Arizona to see meaningless baseball games is one of thehighlights of my year. I've spent too many summer Sundays wishing forbinoculars while squinting from third-deck seats at the Oakland Coliseum notto appreciate a 5,000-seat spring training ballpark. I'm spoiled by Arizonasprings and see-the-actual-tobacco-spit views of Matt Williams, Mark McGwire,Will Clark and Jose Canseco.;    Games seem shorter in spring training, ormaybe there are just more distractions with palm trees swaying in the breezeand the smell of tanning oil and spilled beer in the air. Or maybe it's justmy attention span that's shorter. Once the regulars have taken a time or twoat bat and managers have replaced them with minor-league players I've neverheard of, I head for the exit. And I'm not the only one. Down here, the PAannouncer reeling off names of substitutes is as close to an officialinvitation to take a dip in your hotel pool as you get.;    But those who onlythink of the Cactus League as baseball and paddling in the pool will miss out.You can climb a mountain, mimic a baboon or ring the bell on a vintage fireengine within minutes of the A's ballpark. There's great shopping, restaurantsand plenty to see in Scottsdale, too.;    1991 Cactus League games startedlast Thursday and continue through April 4.;    Here's a look at where tostay, where to eat and what to do when you make your own spring trainingpilgrimage to see the Giants, who play in Scottsdale Stadium, or the A's, whoplay in Phoenix Stadium. One note: Although a spokeswoman with the ScottsdaleChamber of Commerce says tourism is down about 30 percent from previous years,that doesn't mean getting hotel rooms, dinner reservations or baseball ticketsis easy. If you're heading to Phoenix in the next 3 1/2 weeks, call ahead --especially on weekends. The Phoenix Convention andamp; Visitors Bureau can help youfind a room or send you a brochure on affordable accommodations. Call (800)528-0483.;     The Giants:; Scottsdale;  Scottsdale is more about boot storesthan Boot Hill. And Wild Bill isn't a gunslinger. He's a singer appearingnightly at the Rusty Spur Saloon.;    Billed as &quot;The West's Most WesternTown,&quot; Scottsdale's Old Town is a conglomeration of loud bars, souvenir shopsand art galleries. It's a good place to spend a couple of hours -- eitherbefore or after games -- walking around. Scottsdale Stadium is just a fewblocks from the action.;    If you're looking for a Stetson hat or some TonyLama boots, check out Saba's Western Store located in a 70-year-old buildingon the corner of Brown Avenue and Main Street. Want a Mexican blanket? Checkout the Mexican Imports Shop, housed in what used to be a pool hall, a movietheater and a Chinese grocery. If turquoise Indian jewelry, Navajo kachinas,R.C. Gorman posters, hand-painted pottery or woven baskets are on yourshopping list, about every other store in Old Town will gladly accept yourmoney.;    The Chamber of Commerce (7333 Scottsdale Mall, 602-945-8481) has afree pamphlet with a self-guided walking tour. But aside from seeing some oldbuildings -- now housing restaurants or shops -- visitors need to use theirimaginations to get much sense of how it was when this part of the West wasyoung.;    Adjacent to Old Town, the Scottsdale Mall is something of an oasisin a tacky-trinket desert. Built in 1974, the pedestrian-only mall has grassyknolls, lots of fountains, benches for resting and a sculpture of threehorses, &quot;The Yearlings,&quot; that is a popular spot for tourist photos.;    Themall is surrounded by restaurants, civic buildings and the Scottsdale Centerfor the Arts, where a dramatic presentation of the genius of architect FrankLloyd Wright is on display through April 7. Anchoring the &quot;In the Realm ofIdeas&quot; exhibit, which had a stop in Marin County in 1990, is Wright's1,800-square-foot Usonian Automatic House. Designed to show how middle-classAmerica could use Wright's ideas, the house will be a hit with the wholefamily, even kids who might find the rest of the exhibit a little too muchlike school. Hours are Sunday-Wednesday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., andThursday-Saturday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission is $4 for adults and $3 forchildren 5 to 17. Recorded tours are available for $3. Information: (602)994-2787.;    On the other side of Scottsdale Road, nearly 60 commercial artgalleries sell art that ranges from Navajo to new wave. On Thursday nightsfrom 7 to 9, the galleries sponsor art walks, which mean they stay open late,offer artist demonstrations and maybe some refreshments.;    Scottsdale's mosttony side, well-disguised in Old Town, is a world of first-class resorts,championship golf courses and shopping centers such as the Borgata and theBiltmore Fashion Park with designers shops like Bruno Magli, Gucci and LouisVuitton. Most resorts and shopping centers are north of Old Town.;    (check)GETTING AROUND -- There's plenty of free public parking in Old Town. MollyTrolley and the Pony Express Trolley take visitors around Old Town and toother attractions nearby. It's possible to get around this area withoutrenting a car.;    (check) WHERE TO STAY -- Several hotels are within walkingdistance of Scottsdale Stadium and Old Town. All are nice, though none isinexpensive this time of year.;    Fanciest is the brick-facade MarriottSuites (7325 E. Third Ave., 602-945-1550) with 250 suites complete with livingroom, king-size bedroom and marbled bathrooms with separate showers and tubs.Rooms have two TVs and two phones and the hotel has a health club. Rates are$155 until May.;    The Clarion Hotel (7353 E. Indian School Road,602-994-9203), located on Scottsdale Mall, is the closest lodging to the ballpark. Rates range from $132 to $152 double, with some specials available.;   Other nearby hotels include the Ramada Valley Ho (6850 Main St., 602-945-6321)with high-season rates of $123 double and the Days Inn at Fashion Square Mall(4710 N. Scottsdale Road, 602-947-5411), where rates are $104 double.;    Moreaffordable choices are the Fifth Avenue Inn (6935 Fifth Ave., 602-994-9461) at$82 double and the Rodeway Inn (7110 E. Indian School Road, 602-946-3456) at$86 double.;    The Giants stay farther north at the Scottsdale Plaza Resort(7200 N. Scottsdale Road, 602-948-5000). You'll need a car and some big bucksif you want to hang out with the Humm Babies. Rates start at $195 for deluxerooms and $275 for suites with private balconies.;    (check) WHERE TO EAT --Home plates for baseball fans are two venerable institutions. The Pink Pony(3831 N. Scottsdale Road, 602-945-6697), right in Old Town, remains a haunt ofplayers, former players, sportswriters and fans. This dark and noisy placeserves up large cuts of beef. Some consider it a must when visiting the CactusLeague. Let's just say it's musty.;    For our money, Don andamp; Charlie's (7501 E.Camelback Road, 602-990-0900) is a better bet. It's hard to go wrong with theBBQ baby back ribs ($15.95) or the wonderful BBQ pork chops ($13.95). Portionsare large and baseball fans won't mind waiting for a table as they admirehundreds of autographed balls and hundreds of celebrity photos.;    Right inOld Town, you'll find places like the Italian Grotto and Lulu Belle's. They'lldo if you're hungry, but they seem a wee bit touristy.;    For something alittle less obvious, take a stroll down Scottsdale Mall, which has severalnice restaurants. The Rotisserie Bar andamp; Grill (in the Clarion) has $6hamburgers, luncheon salads and sandwiches. The Back Stage Restaurant and Barhas a outdoor patio. Chez Louis is an elegant, but expensive, Frenchrestaurant with entrees such as rack of lamb for two ($38.50) and poachedsalmon with mousseline sauce ($16.25).;    My pick on the mall is the CoyoteCafe (602-947-7081) with delicious Southwestern cuisine and a menu thatchanges every two weeks. We recently had a hard time choosing between theSouthwestern meat loaf on grilled sourdough with jalapeno gravy ($6) or thegrilled eggplant sandwich with roasted peppers and pepper-jack cheese ($5.50).Starters at this cozy eatery that has outdoor seating as well include blackbean cakes with salsa and sour cream ($3.75) and Sonoran-style ceviche ofshrimp and scallops ($7). Entrees such as mesquite grilled pork chops withgreen chili sauce ($15) are dinner choices. The wine list features popularCalifornia varietals including locals such as a Concannon petite sirah, Ridgezinfandel and Bargetto chardonnay.;    There's no shortage of restaurants inthis area whether you're looking for fast food to quiet the kids or somethingfancier for Mom and Dad. My favorite choice for a memorable meal is Bistro LaChaumiere (6910 Main St., 602-946-5115), a French charmer with innovativecuisine. With several dining rooms carved out of a cottage, it's asophisticated, yet comfortable setting. The puree of red pepper soup, thegrilled duck with peppercorns and the flourless chocolate cake are allrecommended. Entrees are about $15, but appetizers, desserts and a nice winelist can turn a visit here into an expensive meal.;     The A's:;Phoenix/Tempe;  There's so much to do near Phoenix Stadium that it's hard todecide where to fit in a spring training baseball game. Right up GalvinParkway, not much more than a long home run from the ball park, are thePhoenix Zoo, the Desert Botanical Garden and Papago Park.;    The zoo (5810 E.Van Buren St., 602-273-7771) has a new Baboon Kingdom exhibit with a21,000-square-foot habitat for two species of these African primates,mandrills and hamadryas baboons. Other highlights are a four-acre Africanveldt, an Arizona exhibit of Southwestern species and a wonderful children'szoo. Hours: Daily, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6 for adults and kids 13 orolder, $3 for children 4-12 and free for kids under 3.;    Kids might notenjoy the Desert Botanical Garden (1201 N. Galvin Parkway, 602-941-1225) asmuch as parents, but it's a colorful place suitable for a quick visit. Morethan 10,000 plants, including some giant Saguaro cactus and brilliantwildflowers, are on display as you take a self-guided walking tour. (If youlove looking at the desert but never leave your car because you know you'llend up looking like one of those cow skulls they sell by the side of the road,this place is the perfect solution.) There's also a great gift shop. Hours:daily, 9 a.m. to sunset. Admission: $4 adults, $1 children 5-12.;    PapagoPark is a great place to go for a pre-game picnic. There's plenty of tablessurrounding a series of lagoons. Many visitors climb a not-so-tall butte for agreat view of the sunset.;    Perhaps the highlight for kids -- better than aCanseco autograph -- would be a visit to the Hall of Flame (6101 E. Van BurenSt., 602-ASK-FIRE). This firefighting museum looks like a warehouse, but it'sjam-packed with shiny fire engines, pump cars and aerial units. There arehelmets and badges and fire hydrants from around the world. You can even climbon a 1916 American La France fire engine, sit behind the big steering wheeland ring the bell. It's adjacent to the practice field behind Phoenix Stadium.Hours: Monday-Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $3 for adults, $1 forchildren 6 to 16.;    Just down Van Buren is Old Town Tempe, where restaurantsand shops are located. It's also the home of Arizona State University.;   (check) GETTING AROUND -- There's not much free parking in Tempe, but garagesare near Mill Avenue shops and restaurants. The Tempe Trolley takes ridersaround Old Town.;    (check) WHERE TO STAY -- Although there are no hotelswithin walking distance of Phoenix Stadium, there are a number of hotelswithin two miles. By the Arizona State campus, there's the Sheraton TempeMission Palms Hotel (60 E. Fifth St., 602-894-1400). Rates at this hotel withmission-influenced architecture range from $88 for a standard double to $118for a deluxe.;    Another near-campus hotel is the Holiday Inn (915 E. Apache,602-968-3451). Rates begin at $85 double. The Papago Inn (7017 E. McDowellroad, 602-947-7335) is a Best Western hotel that's within the vicinity. Ratesare $75 to $105.;    The A's stay at the Doubletree Suites (320 N. 44th St.,Phoenix, 602-225-0500), a nice property between Sky Harbor Airport and PhoenixStadium. Rates range from $89 to $109 for one-bedroom suites. Double rooms arealso available.;    (check) WHERE TO EAT -- Again, you'll need to head to OldTown Tempe to grab a bite before and after the game. The main drag is MillAvenue. On it, there's a good selection of fern bars (Balboa Cafe, ParadiseBar andamp; Grill) and chain restaurants (Chili's, Fat Tuesday).;    For a diningexperience that's has to be consumed to be believed, have a meal at Monti's LaCasa Vieja (3 W. First St., Tempe, 602-967-7594). Built in 1871 for Tempe'sfounding family, the restaurant is a maze of different rooms. The place hascharacter. Prices are reasonable, the portions are huge and the food, well,the portions are huge. Stick to the steaks, although some deep-fried fish andother items are available.;    Bandersnatch Brew Pub (125 E. Fifth Ave.,602-966-4438) is one of four brew pubs in Arizona. The food is bar-food basic(chicken wings, burgers), but the beer is good and a visit recalls campusmemories. It's just down the street from Sun Devil Stadium, home of thePhoenix Cardinals and the Fiesta Bowl. One word of caution: If you want tojoin the Beer in Your Face Club and get a free T-shirt, mug and your name onthe wall, all you have to do is sit back in an old barber's chair and let oneof the employees toss an ice-cold beer right in your face.;    Otherrecommended places on Mill Avenue include the Spaghetti Company (Fourth Streetand Mill Avenue, 602-966-3848), which is open late, has a very inexpensivemenu and is a good choice for kids, and Mill Landing (398 S. Mill Ave.,602-966-1700), which has outdoor seating and a large menu specializing inseafood (around $6 for lunch and $15 at dinner).;    Our favorite is the DepotCantina (300 S. Ash Ave., Tempe, 602-966-6677). This converted train stationis a funky Mexican restaurant with surprisingly good food. The fajitas,stuffed chilies and carnitas are recommended.;     If you go . . .; (check)Tickets; Here's Cactus League ticket information:;    (box) Oakland A's:Phoenix Municipal Stadium, 5999 E.
