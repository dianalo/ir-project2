The detection of cosmicradiation at high energies from Cygnus X-3 would also have far reachingimplications in astrophysics. We review the underground and surface experimentsand question the consistency of the reported observations. We proposesome experimental and statistical tests to settle this important question.</TEXT></DOC>
