The representatives from 86 countries also asked for aninternational fund to help Third World countries replaceenvironmentally hazardous equipment.   The resolution adopted at the U.N.-sponsored conference advancedthe timetable of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which requiresindustrial nations to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons, orCFCs, to half of 1986 levels by 1999.   The declaration said developing countries should be helped infinding and financing alternatives to CFCs, which are used inrefrigeration, cleaning, aerosol cans and other industrial products.   The resolution was drafted by Finland and was accepted withunexpected speed on opening day of a scheduled four-day meeting ofgovernment ministers and experts, which was called to bring theMontreal document up to date.   The ozone layer ranges from nine to 18 miles high. It is theatmospheric layer within the stratosphere in which an appreciableconcentration of ozone gas occurs, absorbing much ultravioletradiation and preventing some heat loss from Earth.   Scientists say the destruction of the ozone layer is causingincreased skin cancer and eye damage and poses a danger to theworld's food chain.   Environmentalists said depletion of the ozone layer is occurringat a much faster rate than foreseen when the Montreal Protocol wassigned.   Finnish President Mauno Koivisto said in his opening speech,``The industrial nations must spend much more on new technologiesand be prepared to transfer applicable technologies and knowhow tothe developing countries.''   As the conference opened, police detained six Greenpeaceprotesters outside the hall. Members of the environmental groupfrom Switzerland, Sweden and Finland had illegally placed a bannerreading ``Ozone Destroyers _ 100 Percent Halt Now'' on flagpolesoutside Finlandia Hall, police said.   They were later released.   The closed-door conference opened in disarray when the draftdeclaration was leaked to reporters before delegates had a chanceto discuss it.   The declaration called for agreement to phase out the dangerousgases listed in the Montreal Protocol ``as soon as possible, butnot later than year 2000, and for that purpose to tighten thetimetable of the Montreal Protocol.''   It urged all nations to join the 36 countries and the 12-nationEuropean Community that have ratified the document signed inMontreal.   Norway called for creation of an international climate fundunder United Nations auspices to make new technologies available todeveloping countries.   Norway's environment minister, Sissel Roenbeck said her countrywould allocate to the fund 0.1 percent of its gross nationalproduct, or about $88 million, provided other industrializedcountries do the same.   The annual production of CFCs is 1.14 million tons, two thirdsof which is produced by the United States and Western Europe. Japanproduces about 12 percent of CFCs and the Soviet Union an estimated10 percent.   Differences between East and West on the causes of ozonedepletion were resolved at a separate meeting of scientists andgovernment officials last week, delegates said.</TEXT></DOC>
