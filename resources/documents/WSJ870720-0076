The #3 billion ($4.8 billion) development, billed as Europe's largest private commercial real-estate project, is designed to lure financial firms from crowded central London quarters. But despite an avalanche of publicity, centered on controversial plans to build London's three tallest buildings on the site, Canary Wharf has yet to establish itself as a desirable headquarters address for blue-chip firms.    No London firm has committed to taking space there besides the three investment banks that came up with the project -- New York-based First Boston Corp. and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., a London-based investment bank 60%-owned by Zurich-based Credit Suisse and 40%-owned by First Boston.    The investment banks, along with New York developer G. Ware Travelstead, formed the original consortium of developers. As expected, that group on Friday sold most of its interest in the project to Toronto-based Olympia andamp; York, a closely held company controlled by the Reichmann family.    Olympia andamp; York assumes full managerial control of and financial responsibility for the project. The original members of the consortium will retain a small interest in the project.    Financial details of the transaction weren't disclosed. But Paul Reichmann, one of Olympia andamp; York's owners, said the consortium had basically only recovered its costs. A spokesman for the consortium said it had spent about #80 million ($128 million) on the project so far.    Mr. Reichmann said Olympia andamp; York's position as one of the world's largest real-estate developers would attract tenants by lending credibility to the project.    Olympia andamp; York expects that economics eventually will prevail over the desire of securities firms to remain in the City, London's financial district. Land costs at Canary Wharf are less than 10% of choice City addresses, and tax incentives from the government further lower the cost of building there.    Olympia andamp; York, with assets estimated to be about 10 billion Canadian dollars ($7.59 billion), was the developer for the World Financial Center in New York. Olympia andamp; York attracted American Express Co. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. to the center by buying their buildings elsewhere in the city.    Olympia andamp; York's financial muscle will allow work to begin on the project without a single lease being signed, Mr. Reichmann added. &quot;We'll let space when the foundation is down or the roof is on or maybe two years later,&quot; he said. The project initially will be financed with Olympia andamp; York's own funds and bank borrowing, he added.    Mr. Reichmann predicted the entire development would be completed in five to seven years, about half the time originally projected. </TEXT></DOC>
