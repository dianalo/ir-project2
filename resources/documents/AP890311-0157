These people _ top corporate executives, directors and majorshareholders _ have been voting consistently with their checkbookslately for higher stock prices in the months and years ahead.   ``The insider buying of the last 16 months is the strongestsustained buying trend on record,'' says editor Norman Fosback inthe current issue of The Insiders, a newsletter that tracks theactivities of what it calls ``America's most knowledgeableinvestors.''   The word ``insider'' has been associated with a lot of illegaltarding activity in recent years.   What Fosback and a good many other analysts track, however, arepurchases and sales that top corporate officials report toregulators in compliance with the rules.   These people tend to be longer-term investors rather thantraders, since the law provides that they can be forced to give upany profits on shares of their own companies held for less than sixmonths.   Since insiders acquire much of their holdings through privatemeans _ exercise of stock options, for example _ their publicactivity naturally involves more selling than buying.   Fosback figures that the ``normal'' level of purchases is 35percent of total transactions.   According to his calculations, insider buying has been above thatnorm since early 1987. It soared to an unprecedented high after thecrash in October 1987, and has settled down in the neighborhood of50 percent over the past year or so.   ``The Insider Indicator simply shows no letup of insiderbuying,'' Fosback said. ``Until the indicator eases down into theselling zone (below 35 percent), expect most market surprises to bepleasant ones.''   Skeptics about the usefulness of this indicator point out thatinsiders were enthusiastically buying through the weeks and monthsthat led up to the crash in the fall of 1987.   Fosback, who readily acknowledged at the time that the insiders``completely missed'' the crash, says the experience showed thatthis indicator, like all others, can't be considered infallible.   But the idea of tracking insider transactions gets anenthusiastic endorsement from Peter Lynch, the celebrated manager ofthe Fidelity Magellan Fund, in the recently published book ``One UpOn Wall Street'' he wrote with John Rothchild.   ``There's no better tipoff to the probable success of a stockthan that people in the company are putting their own money intoit,'' Lynch writes.   ``When insiders are buying like crazy, you can be certain that,at a minimum, the company will not go bankrupt in the next sixmonths.   ``Long term, there's another important benefit. When managementowns stock, then rewarding the shareholders becomes a firstpriority, whereas when management simply collects a paycheck, thenincreasing salaries becomes a first priority.   ``Since bigger companies tend to pay bigger salaries toexecutives, there's a natural tendency for corporate wage-earners toexpand the business at any cost, often to the detriment ofshareholders. This happens less often when management is heavilyinvested in shares.''   Lynch does not advocate using insider purchases as an indicatorfor quick trading profits. Indeed, he does not advocate seekingquick trading profits at all, since he does not think it feasible totry to outguess what the market as a whole is going to do.   Instead, he advocates concentrating on choosing stocks ofcompanies that have good business reasons why they might gaingreater popularity in the future on Wall Street.   Thus, he says, ``if the stock prices drops after the insidershave bought, so that you have a chance to buy it cheaper than theydid, so much the better for you.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday Editions, March 13</NOTE></DOC>
