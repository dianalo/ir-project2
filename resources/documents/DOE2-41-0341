Thefinal aim to distinguish different impact parameter domains with theplastic wall could be achieved using the observed multiplicity as thesampling parameter. With the help of a computer simulation based on aparticipant-spectator model to describe the reation, the mean observedmultiplicity could be established to vary smoothly with the total multiplicity,a variable which is often cited as an indicator for the violence of areaction. Even if the simulation indicates a broad distribution of theobserved multiplicity over the different impact parameters, we couldseparate the extreme cases of peripheral and central collisions. If theevents are selected with the appropriate multiplicity gates, it turnsout that peripheral collisions give rise to enhanced correlations, whereasthe correlation function is strongly reduced for central collisions.Between these extreme values the correlation reduces smoothly with theimpact parameter. The space-time extent of the emitting system is thereforelarger for small impact parameters than in peripheral collisions. Supposingthat the spatial extent is rather independent of the impact parameter(except for very peripheral collisions) we suggest that the observedvariation of the correlation function could indicate a variation of theemission time for light particles rather than a spatial evolution. Onthe contrary the temperature, determined equally after an event-typeselection with the observed multiplicity, shows no variation with theimpact parameter. This could indicate that a limiting temperature isreached at a value at which the emission of particles is faster thanthe temporal development of the temperature. (orig./HSI).</TEXT></DOC>
