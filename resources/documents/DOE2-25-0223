Six countries make up 95 % of the total proven oiland gas reserves of the region, and although the deep Mediterranean seahas not been explored yet, very large discoveries seem ruled out. Reflectingthe regional economic heterogeneity, one can distinguish the Northernand oil exporting countries (heavy consumption, with large and sophisticatedrefining industries) from the other nations which have smaller refiningtools and energy consumptions. In all countries, motorfuels consumptionis expected to grow. Finally, one should note the exceptional masteryof complex energy techniques by the Mediterranean countries, especiallyas regards offshore drilling and production, heavy oil refining and liquefiednatural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
