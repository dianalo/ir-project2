When the dust settled from Monday's turbulent national vote, thebalance of power seemed to have changed little because theconservative opposition also lost ground.   Voters had switched allegiances as never before.   A radical right-wing party went into the election with twoparliament seats and came out with 22. A far-left party doubled itsstrength.   ``This election clearly shows that the new generation is sick andtired of the old parties,'' said Trygve Bull, a retired educator andformer leftist politician.   As in the 1985 election, Mrs. Brundtland and her allies were leftjust shy of a majority. But it was unclear if the opposition partiescould overcome their disunity to unseat her.   According to official results with all but the absentee ballotscounted, Labor won 63 seats in an expanded 165-seat parliament, orStorting, and 17 seats went to its allied Socialist Left Party. Thethree-party non-socialist alliance _ Conservatives, ChristianDemocrats and Center Party _ received 62 seats.   Shunned as a partner by all other parties, the rightist Party ofProgress swept up 22 seats in a stunning performance that indicatedwidespread disenchantment with the social welfare policies of thelast 40 years.   A lone independent won a seat on a local list after he broke withLabor.   Labor was hurt by record unemployment of 5 percent and discontentamong this country's 4.2 million people with a growing shortage ofhospital facilities, day-care centers and care for the aged. About82.4 percent of registered voters turned out.   Official results showed Labor with 896,717 votes, or 34.3 percentof the ballots, down 6.5 percent from the 39.8 percent it polledfour years ago. The Conservatives had 580,425 votes and 22.2 percentof the vote.   The Progress Party won 340,461 votes for 13 percent of the total,nearly triple its percentage from the last election, and theSocialist Left's 261,814 votes represented 10 percent, or nearlydouble its past percentage.   In a post-election television debate of party leaders, Mrs.Brundtland watched silently while her opponents tradedrecriminations. ``You are the ones creating chaos,'' one accused therest.   Despite the setback, Mrs. Brundtland said she had no intention toquit, and doubted that any center-right alliance could last forlong. ``A non-socialist coalition could break up at any time,'' shesaid.   Her refusal to step down meant the opposition would have todefeat her in a no-confidence motion when parliament convenes onOct. 2.   Opposition leader Jan P. Syse of the Conservative Party, whichalso suffered heavy losses, admitted that ``it was not the bestresult for forming an alternative government.''   The opposition parties were split over tax issues, welfareprograms, agricultural subsidies, relations with the EuropeanCommunity and immigration policies.   Carl I. Hagen, the Progress party's blunt-speaking leader, saidhe was prepared to help topple the Labor government in ano-confidence vote and to negotiate a majority government. But heaccused the other non-socialists of locking him out.   ``You say no to even entering the room to discuss the questionwith us,'' he said in the television debate, blaming them for thechaos in the rightist camp.   ``The next government will have to be a minority government,''said Center Party leader Johan J. Jakobsen. ``The 12 percent whovoted for the Progress party can't dictate policies that the other88 percent of voters will have to live with.''</TEXT></DOC>
