In its ruling, the court endorsed the &quot;efficient market&quot; theory, which holds that a person trading in a stock can assume its market price reflects all available public information about the issuing company. Under this theory, which already had been applied by most federal appeals courts, investors alleging securities fraud don't have to prove individually that they relied on misleading information.    The court also ruled that under federal securities law and Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the existence of early merger negotiations may sometimes be &quot;material.&quot; Under federal law, &quot;material&quot; information can't be the subject of false and misleading public statements and in some circumstances must be disclosed to investors.    By a 6-0 vote, the court rejected suggestions that it rule that early merger discussions are never material until there is an &quot;agreement in principle&quot; on the price and structure of a corporate acquisition.    The court said the question of when merger talks are material must be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account &quot;the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or misrepresented information,&quot; the likelihood that the merger will take place and the importance of the merger to the companies.    The decision, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, is also favorable to the SEC's position in the pursuit of insider trading based on merger negotiations.    If the court had said that preliminary merger talks aren't &quot;material,&quot; it could have jeopardized an entire area of SEC insider-trading enforcement aimed at individuals and companies that profit from early, non-public merger information.    Daniel Goelzer, general counsel of the SEC, called the opinion a &quot;pro-SEC, pro-securities law decision.&quot; But he described it as more significant for what it didn't do. Had the court said that preliminary merger talks weren't material, Mr. Goelzer said, &quot;a big chunk of our insider-trading work would be under a cloud.&quot;    Many takeover specialists said the ruling wouldn't significantly alter existing corporate practices. That is because the court only defined when merger information is material; it didn't deal with questions about when information about mergers must be disclosed.    &quot;The sound practice has been, if you get inquiries&quot; about a merger, said Arthur Fleischer, a New York lawyer, &quot;you should have a consistent practice of no comment.&quot; The high court yesterday observed in a footnote that it wasn't suggesting any change in companies' practice of silence or &quot;no comment&quot; about the existence of merger talks.    The court's ruling came in an appeal by Basic Inc., which was acquired in 1978 by Combustion Engineering Inc. Basic was sued by former shareholders who charged the company with making misleading statements in denying that there were merger talks between the two companies for more than a year.    The shareholders charged that they sold their shares at an artificially low price before the takeover. A federal district court allowed the lawsuit to proceed as a class action but dismissed the case before trial. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati reinstated the lawsuit. The high court ruling yesterday sent the case back to the appeals court to apply the new test of when information is material.    The SEC's Mr. Goelzer said, &quot;I don't think there'll be a revolution in disclosure policy&quot; because of the ruling. &quot;As long as you're otherwise entitled to be silent about something, this opinion confirms that 'no comment' is a permissible response to inquiries.&quot;    But some takeover lawyers complained that the decision's case-by-case approach didn't provide enough guidance to lawyers. Stephen Volk, a New York lawyer, said, &quot;It would be nice, from the point of view of people doing deals, if there was a clear delineation&quot; of what is or isn't material.    Equally important is the portion of yesterday's decision that puts the Supreme Court's imprimatur on an idea -- which the SEC says has been endorsed by eight appeals courts -- called the &quot;efficient-market&quot; theory or the &quot;fraud-on-the-market&quot; theory. The concept is that a stock price is based on the market's having all available public information, and that any misleading information defrauds purchasers, whether or not they relied on the misleading statements.    Justice Byron White, joined by Justice Sandra O'Connor, dissented from the court's acceptance of this theory. Justice White argued that by embracing the efficient-market theory, the court opened the way to suits by investors &quot;who can show little more than that they sold stock at a lower price than what might have been.&quot;    The high court, by a 4-2 vote, said investors may file class actions in behalf of all shareholders who sold before a particular event or at a particular price. If each investor had to prove individually that he or she relied on information that was misleading, class actions would be impossible. The court said a company is legally entitled to present evidence rebutting the idea that a particular investor was harmed as part of a fraud on the market. And a company may show that an individual investor traded shares for other reasons.    But the ruling may expose companies to greater liability because of the use of class-action cases. This was the message to the high court in friend-of-the-court briefs filed by the Big Eight accounting firms and by the American Corporate Counsel Association.    The court's decision involved only six justices. Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy didn't participate.    ---   James B.
