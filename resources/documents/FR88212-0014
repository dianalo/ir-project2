Background</ITAG>A. The Proposed RuleOn May 7, 1987, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR)in this proceeding (52 FR 18703 (May 19, 1987)) proposing regulations toprovide for abandonment of certain sales and purchases under section 7(b)of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) by both sellers and purchasers where the underlyingcontract term has expired, the contract has been terminated under a provisionof the contract, or the purchase and sales obligations have been terminatedor modified by mutual agreement of the parties.The Commission proposed that the rule be applicable to ``first sales''of gas as defined in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) and to purchasesby a pipeline from another pipeline. Under the proposal, any party to acontract for such a sale, once the contract term has expired or has beenterminated by exercise of an option contained therein, could notify theother party that it will cease sales or purchases under the contract atthe expiration of thirty days from the date of notification, or the notificationperiod in the contract, whichever period is longer. Similarly, where aparty had exercised a contractual provision to modify the purchase or salesobligation, abandonment would be authorized to the extent of the modification.The proposed rule would also apply where the parties to the contract hadmutually agreed to terminate the contract, or to modify it to allow thetemporary abandonment. In that situation termination or modification ofthe parties' certificate obligations would become effective in accordancewith the parties' agreement.Under the proposed rule, abandonment of purchases by a pipeline from aproducer would be conditioned upon the pipeline providing the transportationof the abandoned gas. If the abandoning pipeline were not an open-accesstransporter subject to the non-discrimination provisions of andSection; 284.8(b)or andSection; 284.9(b) of the Commission's regulations, transportation wouldhave been available under andSection; 284.227, a blanket transportation provisionsimilar to that promulgated in Order No. 451.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Ceiling Prices; Old Gas Pricing Structure, 51 FR 22,168(June 18, 1986), III FERC Statutes andamp; Regulations andpara; 30,701. OrderNo. 451 is under review in the United States Court of Appeals for the FifthCircuit. Mobil Oil Exploration <T3>et al. </T3>v. FERC, No. 86-4950. Authority to abandon the sale or purchase of gas would be granted automaticallyupon compliance with the above conditions. The proposed rule further providedfor the grant of a blanket certificate to the producer or other first sellerunder andSection; 157.301 of the Commission's regulations to sell the abandonedgas for resale in interstate commerce, with pregranted abandonment of anysale of the gas under the blanket certificate upon termination of the contract.The abandoning party, or the purchaser if the abandonment is mutually agreedto, would be required to notify the Commission of the abandonment withinthirty days after the effective date of the abandonment, and provide theCommission with certain information concerning the abandoned transaction.The rule would apply to all contracts between producers and pipelines,and would not be limited to contracts containing an indefinite price escalationclause, which is a prerequisite under the good faith negotiation proceduresof Order No. 451. Thus all gas sold under any expired contract betweenproducers and pipelines would be eligible for price renegotiation or abandonment.\2\<NOTE/> In addition, purchases under expired contracts between pipelineswould be covered by the proposed rule, although such contracts are notwithin the scope of Order No. 451 because they are not ``first sales.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Commission assumes that producers that are eligiblefor abandonment under the regulations would usually attempt to negotiatea new contract with the existing purchaser at current market prices. The NOPR requested general comments on the proposed rule, and commentson specific questions posed by Commissioners Stalon and Trabandt. The NOPRnoted that the Commission was concerned that the benefits meant to accruefrom the proposed rule may not be fully realized by captive residentialcustomers of local distribution companies (LDC's) because of the unavailabilityof Order No. 436 transportation.\3\<NOTE/> Thus the Commission sought comments on modifying the proposedrule to condition the blanket abandonment authorized under the rule onthe pipeline purchaser providing Order No. 436 transportation. Secondly,the Commission sought comments on whether to require pipeline/purchasersto transport from producer/sellers in cases where the producer unilaterallyabandons sales. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Regulation of Natural Gas Pipelines After Partial WellheadDecontrol, 50 FR 42,408 (October 18, 1985), FERC Statutes andamp; Regulations[Regulations Preambles 1982-1985] andpara; 30,665 (October 9, 1985). In OrderNo. 500, 52 FR 30,334 (August 14, 1987), III FERC Statutes andamp; Regulationsandpara; 30,761 (August 7, 1987) and Orders No. 500-B, and 500-C, 41 FERCandpara; 61,025 (October 16, 1987), 41 FERC andpara; 61,351, the Commissionpromulgated interim regulations in response to the decision of the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in AssociatedGas Distributors v. FERC, 824 F.2d 981 (D.C. Cir. 1987) which vacated OrderNo. 436 and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The Commission also requested comments as to whether the proposed rulecomports with NGA section 7(b) requirements and whether a generic one yearlimited-term abandonment should be substituted for the permanent abandonmentauthorized by the proposed rule. After the Commission issued the NOPR, the United States Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit issued certain decisions relevantto the NOPR. On June 23, 1987, it decided <T3>Associated Gas Distributors v. FERC, </T3>824 F.2d 981 (<T3>AGD</T3>), ruling upon and remanding Order No. 436. On July 23, 1987,it issued <T3>Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. v. FERC, </T3>823 F.2d630 (<T3>Con Ed</T3>), ruling upon and remanding <T3>Felmont Oil Corp. et al., </T3>which set forth the Commission's newpolicy for determining whether abandoment of sales from undepleted reserveswould be in the public interest.\4\<NOTE/> Furthermore, on August 7, 1987, the Commission issued OrderNo. 500, which responded to the Court's remand of AGD. \5\<NOTE/> Order No. 500 became effective on September 15, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Felmont Oil Corp. and Essex Offshore, Inc., 33 FERC andpara;61,333 (1985), <T3>reh'q denied, </T3>34 FERC andpara; 61,296 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 52 FR 30,334 (August 14, 1987), III FERC Statutes andamp;Regulations andpara; 30,761.The Commission received seventy-nine comments on the proposed rule (includingseven from parties that requested the Commission to accept their late-filedcomments): seventeen from producers, sixteen from gas pipelines, twenty-eightfrom local gas distribution companies (LDCs), twelve from public entities,and six from marketers and end users.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Some commenters fall into more than one category. A listof commenters is attached as Appendix A. B. Changes in the RuleThe Commission, after consideration of the comments and further reviewof the rule in light of <T3>AGD </T3>and <T3>Con Ed, </T3>has decided to revise the proposed rule in two respects,and to clarify that the rule will apply where the contract permits oneparty to the contract to reduce, suspend or terminate its purchase or salesobligation, such as by the exercise of a ``market out'' clause. First,the final rule provides that it will be applicable to all first sales,including first sales to local distribution companies (LDC's). As explainedmore fully <T3>infra,</T3> p. 36, if sales to LDC's were excluded, producers mightbe deterred from entering into new contracts with LDC's because they wouldrequire specific Commission approval to abandon such sales. Second, theCommission has decided that only pipelines that have accepted a blanketcertificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing transportationof gas under andSection; 284.221 of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R.284.221 (1987), will be granted the right to abandon purchases under expiredcontracts. As explained more fully <T3>infra, </T3>p. 33, because the rule will not mandate transportationwhen the producer initiates abandonment, pipelines that have not acceptedblanket certificates under andSection; 284.221 of the Commission's regulationscould be in a more advantageous position than those that have. Accordingly,to ensure that the rule does not act as a disincentive to pipelines becomingPart 284 transporters, only pipelines that have accepted blanket certificatesunder Part 284 will be eligible to exercise the right to abandon purchasesunder the rule unilaterally. This condition will help assure consumersmore meaningful long-term access to gas supplies released under this rule.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The requirement that a pipeline have a blanket certificateunder andSection; 284.221 of the Commission's regulations means that thepipeline may not discontinue transportation without the Commission's permission,unlike transportation under andSection; 284.101. This requirement is necessaryto prevent a pipeline's manipulation of its Part 284 authorization to obtainthe benefits of the rule, which include the right to abandon purchasesof gas permanently. A pipeline not accepting a blanket certificate underandSection; 284.221 will be required to seek abandonment of purchases ona case-by-case basis, under section 7(b) of the NGA, subject to scrutinyby the pipeline's customers and the Commission.The Commission also intends the rule to apply where a party exercises acontractual provision granting the party a right either to reduce, suspendor terminate takes or deliveries. These provisions, such as ``market-out''clauses, give a party the right to refuse to purchase or sell under certainconditions specified in the contract.\8\<NOTE/> However the nature of the rights granted and whether theright was properly exercised are contractual issues to be determined bya court of competent jurisdiction.\9\<NOTE/> The rule does not expand any rights granted under an existingcontract to cease selling or purchasing, but does permit the sale of jurisdictionalgas to another once the right has been properly exercised.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, 38 FERC andpara; 61,306at 62,003 n.13 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ See KN Energy Inc. v. H.G. Westerman, 38 FERC andpara; 61,108(1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ For example: Where a purchaser under a contract thatprovides a right to cease purchases under specified conditions, <T3>e.g.,</T3> when the spot market price for gas is $1.50 or less perMcf, notifies the producer that it is exercising that right, the rule grantsabandonment to both the purchaser and the seller 30 days after the noticeis given, or the notice period provided in the contract. The rule enablesthe seller to sell the gas to any other party during the time that thepurchaser is permitted by the contract to cease purchases. As noted <T3>supra,</T3> this period is governed by the contractual arrangement.Absent the rule, the seller would be shut in, and would be required toseek specific abandonment authority from the Commission, as well as specificcertificate authority to sell the gas in interstate commerce to any otherpurchaser.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>A. Rationale for the Proposed RuleUnder section 7(b) of the NGA, once gas is ``dedicated'' to serve an interstatecommerce customer, the producer cannot sell the gas to any other customersuntil the Commission finds that abandonment is required by the public convenienceand necessity. The Commission concluded that to carry out the NGA's purposesand goals, of regulating the supply and price of natural gas, interstateservice obligations should not be limited to the contractual term betweenthe parties.\11\<NOTE/> In <T3>Con Ed,</T3> the court explained (823 F.2d at 633):<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. FPC, 364 U.S. 137, 153-55(1960).<ITAG tagnum="21">In an energy market in which natural gas supplies were problematicand in which the unregulated intrastate markets threatened to swallow uplarge portions of those supplies, the abandonment provision served as abrake on the movement of gas out of the interstate stream.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, in enacting the NGPA in 1978, Congress significantly changedthe method of achieving this desired objective by permitting market forces,to a very large extent, to regulate price and supply.\12\<NOTE/> As a result the natural gas market has been converted toa nationwide market, virtually eliminating the need for the Commission'sprior abandonment policy, because both interstate and intrastate gas consumershave equal access to new gas production without substantial price disparity``to assure adequate supplies of natural gas at fair prices.'' \13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ We note that NGPA Section 315, 15 U.S.C. 3375 (1982),requires that any first sale contract covering gas produced from a reservoiron the Outer Continental Shelf and which is not subject to the Commission'sNGA jurisdiction, must have a duration of not less than fifteen years,or if less, the commercially producible life of the reservoir. That sectionhas no application to gas covered by this rule because the rule appliesonly to gas that is dedicated to interstate commerce and subject to theCommission's NGA jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. State Oil andGas Board of Mississippi, 474 U.S. 409, 106 S. Ct. 709, 716 (1986).After passage of the NGPA and the onset of an over-supply condition, diminutionof demand, and the incurring of take-or-pay obligations by pipelines, theCommission recognized the need to reexamine existing policies relatingto the public convenience and necessity standard of NGA section 7(b). Thusthe Commission permitted special marketing programs (SMP's), which authorized,upon relase by pipelines, temporary abandonment by producers, and subsequentsale of certain categories of gas under certain conditions to other (generallyindustrial, fuel switching) customers of the pipeline releasing the gas.The Commission found that the public convenience and necessity requiredsuch temporary abandonments in order to allow pipelines to obtain take-or-payrelief.The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitstruck down the SMP's in <T3>Maryland People's Counsel </T3>v.<T3> FERC (MPC I)</T3> \14\<NOTE/> because of the exclusion of ``captive customers'' from theclass of customers eligible to participate in the programs. The SMP's atissue in <T3>MPC I </T3>had already expired when the court rendered its decisionon May 10, 1985. Since successor SMP orders with later expiration dateshad been issued by the Commission, the Court directed the Commission toshow cause why the successor orders should not also be vacated. In <T3>MPC II,</T3>\15\<NOTE/> the court held that the new orders were similarly infectedwith unlawful discrimination. However, since the new orders were scheduledto expire on October 31, 1985, the court stated that it would ``allow thecurrent SMP orders to die a natural death,'' by which time the Commissionwas expected ``to promulgate new rules that may effect fundamental changesin the marketing of natural gas.'' The court was referring to the Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking that ultimately resulted in Order No. 436.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ 761 F.2d 768 (D.C. Cir. 1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ 765 F.2d 450 (D.C. Cir. 1985).In a series of orders issued subsequent to <T3>MPC II,</T3> the Commission approved limited-term abandonments (LTA's)and granted sales certificates to permit continuation of the sale of thegas that had been sold under various SMP's that expired on October 31,1986.\16\<NOTE/> However, the Commission also concluded that these orderswould provide important benefits to the public interest, even after OrderNo. 436 programs were implemented, and extended the authorizations becausethey allowed for the release by pipelines of shut-in, above-market-pricedgas which could be sold by producers at market clearing prices. The Commissionfound that the public interest was served by temporary abandonments becausepipelines could obtain take-or-pay relief, producers were able to sellgas and generate cash flow, and increased gas supplies available for salesmade the natural gas market more price sensitive.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ The LTA's were issued in basket orders covering numerousapplications. The leading case is Tenneco Oil Co., 33 FERC andpara; 61,134(1985), <T3>reh'g denied and clarification granted, </T3>34 FERC andpara; 61,145(1986). The Commission has also issued other LTA orders approving manyapplications, 33 FERC andpara; 61,233 (1985), 33 FERC andpara; 61,173 (1985),and 33 FERC andpara; 61,326 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 34 FERC andpara; 61,407(1986); Marathon Oil Co., 34 FERC andpara; 61,417 (1986); and Odeco Oil andGas Co., 38 FERC andpara; 61,343 (1987).In the Commission's April 10, 1985 Policy Statement,\18\<NOTE/> the Commission stated that the public convenience and necessitypermitted parties to change their interstate service obligations to accommodatetake-or-pay buy-out agreements. The Commission stated that it would expeditiouslygrant abandonment authorization necessary to implement any contract renegotiationsreached by the parties, and that where a producer files for abandonmentto implement such renegotiations made pursuant to the policy statement,the pipeline purchaser will be deemed to have waived its right to opposethe abandonment. Subsequently, in Order No. 436, the Commission developeda regulatory approach to ``allow competitive forces to operate in thoseareas where Congress has determined they will better protect the publicinterest than traditional utility-type regulation, while retaining traditional-typeregulation in those areas where competitive forces have been found inadequateby the Congress.'' \19\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\  Regulatory Treatment of Payments Made in Lieu of Take-or-PayObligations, 50 FR 16076 (April 24, 1985); FERC Statutes and Regulations[Regulations Preambles 1982-1985] andpara; 30,637.

In Order No. 436, the Commission reaffirmed its April 1985 Policy Statement,and expanded the categories of gas that could be the subject of expeditedabandonment, stating: <ITAG tagnum="21">In the Commission's judgment, new andSection; 2.77 is consistent withthe policies reflected in this rule, in that producers should be able tosell shut-in gas and purchasers, to the extent possible, should be ableto renegotiate or buy-out higher priced contracts so that gas under thosecontracts can be sold at market-clearing prices. To this end, the Commissionwill consider requests for permanent, limited-term, or partial abandonmentof sales subject to reduced takes irrespective of the NGPA price categoryof such gas.\20\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 31,566. The Commission further noted its concern ``about the need for abandonmentin cases where the underlying contract has expired'' because of ``the marketdisordering effects of reduced sales of lower-priced gas as well as theeconomic effect on sellers.'' \21\<NOTE/> The Commission declined to issue any criteria for allowingabandonment under expired contracts at that time but added that it would:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ <T3>Id.</T3>  <ITAG tagnum="21">Review the matter based on experience gained in individual proceedingsand will, if it appears reasonable and desirable to do so, establish guidelinesto be applied in ruling on future contested abandonments as a means offurther expediting the determination of such abandonments.\22\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 31,567. In 1985, the Commission further reconsidered its abandonment policy undersection 7(b) in <T3>Felmont Oil Corp</T3>., <T3>et al.</T3> (<T3>Felmont</T3> and Opinion No. 245).\23\<NOTE/> In <T3>Felmont</T3> the Commission revised its abandonment policy and changedthe focus of its analysis in light of the current situation in the gasindustry. Rather than limiting its public convenience and necessity analysisto a comparison between the needs of a current purchaser and a specificprospective new purchaser, the Commission sought to balance the benefitsto the natural gas market as a whole from a release of dedicated gas againstany detriments to the current purchaser and its customers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ In <T3>Con Ed,</T3> the court remanded <T3>Felmont</T3>. We will discuss that case in more detail, <T3>infra</T3> p. 24. Whether or not natural gas is dedicated to interstate commerce does not,at a particular moment, impact the total gas supply available to the gasmarket as a whole. Continuation of the dedication of the gas after expirationor termination of a contract merely places restraints on the movement ofthe gas, preventing it from going from one group of customers to othercustomers who may currently have a greater need for it. If supplies werefree to move quickly, as contemplated under this rule, the nation's entiregas supply could be more efficiently utilized to satisfy consumer needs,because the gas supply could be allocated as the market dictates. Sucha nationwide market could not efficiently operate with the delays and limitationsinherent in a case-by-case review of each abandonment filing. The Commission believes that continuation of the service obligation afterthe contract has expired is no longer required by the public convenienceand necessity because it prevents market forces from operating efficiently.When either a producer or a purchaser concludes that it is no longer economicallyefficient to continue sales or purchases under an expired contract, Congress'NGPA policies are thwarted by policies that prevent that gas from enteringthe marketplace. Thus, for example, producers whose gas is not being takenby the party to whom the gas is dedicated should be able to sell it toothers who are willing to purchase it. Moreover, producers with contractsfor the sale of gas at prices that may be less than the replacement costof gas reserves should be permitted to seek the market price up to themaximum lawful price for that gas once the contract expires.\24\<NOTE/> After the contract has expired or been terminated and thegas is abandoned, the producer may enter into new contracts for the saleof the gas. Under Order No. 451, the alternative ceiling price is applicableto any contract ``executed after July 18, 1986,'' \25\<NOTE/> and thus gas that is abandoned and then sold under a newcontract is eligible to receive up to the alternative ceiling price. Similarly,purchasers should not be required to continue purchasing relatively high-pricedgas when the contract term expires, unless it is in their interest to doso. In that situation, the purchaser, and not the Commission, should determinewhether it wishes to continue purchasing under the contract. Accordingly,the rule treats both producers and purchasers even-handedly, and allowseither party to abandon, under NGA section 7(b), the purchase or sale obligationwhen the contract term expires without the need to obtain prior Commissionapproval on a case-by-case basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ In Order No. 451, the Commission found that the formersystem of vintaged rates for old gas was a ``substantial source of marketdistortion causing producers to prematurely abandon easily accessible supplies,and consumers to react to misleading market signals based on chance historicalcosts rather than current economic efficiencies,'' and was therefore unjustand unreasonable. III FERC Statutes and Regulations andpara; 30,701 at 30,219.The Commission found that the ceiling price for ``post-'74 old gas'' underthe NGPA was the current replacement cost of natural gas, and replacementcost was a reasonable basis for establishing the just and reasonable pricefor all vintages of old gas. Furthermore, the use of replacement cost asthe ceiling price was necessary to avoid the adverse effects of lower ceilingprices for older vintages of old gas and to encourage certain beneficialeffects on gas supply and overall prices. <T3>Id.</T3> at 30,219-229. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ 18 C.F.R. 271.402(c)(7)(i) (1987). New reserves that are subject to the Commission's NGA jurisdiction accountfor a decreasing percentage of total new reserve additions and will continueto decrease in the future because the NGPA ``prevents the universe of gassubject to the NGA from expanding.''\26\<NOTE/> As the Commission noted in the NOPR, a study prepared bythe Commission's Office of Pipeline and Producer Regulation (OPPR) entitled``Dedicated Interstate Gas Supply, Potential Supplemental Sources and TheirEffects on Meeting Potential Demand'' (April 1987) indicates that at thepresent time the reserves of dedicated gas subject to the Commission'scertificate and abandonment authority are serving a diminishing role insatisfying total nationwide natural gas requirements of residential andcommercial customers. Thus dedicated reserves have already diminished tothe point that they are probably insufficient to meet the demands of totalU.S. high-priority customers, and must necessarily have a continued diminishingrole in the future. The goal of the Commission's certificate and abandonmentpolicy during the 1970's of maintaining enough dedicated reserves to protecthigh-priority customers in the interstate market against possible shortagescan no longer be realized since the passage of the NGPA. Therefore, theCommission's abandonment policies must be modified to reflect current marketconditions caused in part by the NGPA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Penzoil Co. v. FERC, 645 F.2d 360, 380 (5th Cir. 1981),cert. denied 454 U.S. 1142 (1982).The Commission pointed out in the NOPR that even under the NGA, naturalgas shortages were a recurring phenomenon, and to some extent abandonmentpolicies exacerbated the shortages because where gas surpluses existedon certain pipeline systems, the surplus gas could not readily be utilizedto alleviate gas shortages existing on other pipeline systems. Nothingin the comments challenges this conclusion.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Commenters objecting to the proposed rule do not questionthis, but assert that the proposed rule may have unforeseen consequenceswith respect to Order No. 451. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>ANR at 5-6; Tennessee at 4.The rule will also further the aim and purposes of curtailment plans. Nolonger will purchasers be able to husband dedicated gas (under expiredcontracts) that they do not currently want, even though other consumersmay have a need for it. Instead, the gas will become available to all,thereby permitting the market mechanism to provide gas supplies to thosewho need it. Should there be a general shortfall of supplies of gas, theavailable supplies will be allocated by each pipeline under approved curtailmentplans. The prior abandonment rule did not help in such a situation, butfurther exacerbated the problem, because excess supplies on one systemcould not be shifted quickly to other systems that were experiencing shortages.This rule should alleviate this distortion for jurisdictional gas underexpired contracts.While the availability of generic abandonment procedures would not detrimentallyaffect high-priority customers' assurance of supply, it would provide anumber of benefits. First, the rule would increase competition becausethe supply of gas available to the market will be increased by allowinggas previously dedicated to a single purchaser to enter the nationwidemarket and by allowing purchasers greater access to supplies. The increasein competition will make the price of gas more market responsive. The secondeconomic benefit of the rule is that it will increase high-priority users'access to gas. If gas subject to expired contracts is not permitted toenter the market when that gas is not currently being taken by the pipelinesto whom it is dedicated, high-priority customers of other pipelines donot have access to all of the existing dedicated reserves. However, underthe rule adopted in this order, the ability of gas supplies to move amongdifferent systems and regions in response to consumers' demands would beenhanced. Thus consumers will benefit because their suppliers will nowhave access to more supplies of gas. No longer will gas under expired contractsbe shut-in because the dedicated purchaser would rather not take it atthis time. Moreover, the nation's broader energy security interests willbe served by the removal of regulatory impediments to access to naturalgas by reducing the vulnerability of the economy to oil supply disruptions.Oil shortages can be ameliorated by the ability of many boiler fuel usersto switch to gas, if gas reserves can be quickly brought to market withoutthe delay of abandonment proceedings before the Commission. (U.S. Departmentof Energy, Energy Security: A Report to the President of the United Statesat p. 40 (March 1987)).The immediate price impact of the rule on consumers will not likely besignificant. The most recent available data shows that about 17 percentof interstate pipelines' purchases of dedicated gas are under expired contracts,and dedicated gas represents approximately 60 percent of those pipelines'total purchases of gas.\28\<NOTE/> Thus interstate pipelines' purchases of dedicated gas underexpired contracts represent approximately 10 percent of their total purchasesof gas. Some of this flowing gas is purchased at prices below current marketprices and some is purchased at prices above current market prices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ See Table 1, p. 2 and Table 2, p. 2.<ITAG tagnum="28">Note: These tables are not being printed in the </ITAG><T4>Federal Register </T4>but are contained in copies of this order whichare available through the Commission's Public Reference Division.For 1987, the average price for spot purchases of natural gas in Texasand Louisiana for various delivery areas varied from $1.35 per MMBtu to$1.49 per MMBtu. The average price in the Rocky Mountains for 1987 was$1.15 per MMBtu, and $1.75 per MMBtu in the Appalachian Mountains.\29\<NOTE/> In 1984, the average price of all gas flowing under wellheadcontracts that expired before 1988 was $1.33 per MMBtu. Since 1984, theaverage price of all section 104 gas decreased only slightly. Informationon the current average prices for all gas flowing under expired contractsis not available, but it can be reasonably assumed to be between $1.30and $1.80 per MMBtu for 1987. Assuming that all flowing gas dedicated underexpired contracts (about .169 x 3.130 = .53 Quadrillion Btu) \30\<NOTE/> is abandoned and can be repurchased at average 1987 spotmarket prices in Texas and Louisiana, the impact on the market varies froma decrease in the average interstate wellhead price to an increase of 2percent. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ NG Week, January 11, 1988, p. 9.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ See Table 1, p. 2.The Commission recognizes that the amount of gas that may fall under therule as a result of voluntary agreements cannot be quantified because itis within the parties' discretion. However, we perceive no danger to consumersbecause the authority granted does not alter pipelines' responsibilitiesto meet their service obligations under their certificates. A pipeline'sdecision to release gas constitutes a purchasing practice which would besubject to challenge by its customers both in rate proceedings as wellas when the pipeline makes its purchased gas adjustment filings. Finallythe impact on consumers where abandonment is authorized under market-outclauses is likely to be beneficial, because those clauses generally providepipelines with the right to cease purchasing high-priced gas. The rulewill merely permit the sale of that gas to others at prices governed bymarket considerations.If as the result of the abandonment rule more gas is made available forsale, the spot and longer term prices would be driven lower by the increasedsupplies. Of course the actual course of events in 1988 and beyond cannotbe foreseen. Nevertheless, the immediate price impact of the abandomentrule on the market as a whole should not be great.Moreover, gas flowing under contracts due to expire in the future willincreasingly consist of higher priced gas, and thus there should be lessand less impact on consumers. In fact the rule is likely to have a positiveimpact on consumers because purchasers will be in a position to abandonthe higher priced gas and replace it with purchases at lower market prices,a substantial amount of which will be abandoned gas re-entering the market.The rule must be viewed in the context of the Congressional and Commissionpolicy of permitting the parties in the natural gas industry to determinethe allocation of the nation's gas reserves. By providing open access onthe pipelines, and more competitive markets, the Commission is seekingto permit the market participants to determine where the gas should flowand at what price. This rule is a part of this overall strategy. It freesgas to move where it is needed, rather than tying it indefinitely to thededicated purchaser who may have no current need for the gas.The Commission concludes that the new rule will improve the working ofthe market and thus provide economic benefits to all participants. Thestandard used in <T3>Felmont</T3> and in Order No. 451, of balancing the particular purchaser'sneeds and the needs of the market as a whole, supports adoption of theproposed rule.B. Implications of Con Ed and AGDThe NOPR was issued and the comments received prior to the <T3>Con Ed</T3> and <T3>AGD</T3> decisions. Those decisions have addressed some of the legalissues raised both in the NOPR and by commenters. The Commission believesthat nothing in those decisions requires it to change the new abandonmentpolicy established in this rule, and in fact, those decisions support theaction it is taking here.First, we note that the court decisions support the Commission's authorityto promulgate a new abandonment policy, providing that the policy changeis adequately explained and based on reasoned decisionmaking. Thus, in<T3>Con Ed</T3> the court stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">At the outset, we agree with the FERC that the NGA itself does notmandate a comparative needs test but only a determination that presentor future public convenience and necessity permits the abandonment at issue.In other words, by delegating abandonment power in such broad terms, <T3>Congress expected that the Commission would develop an appropriatetest to fit the regulatory climate </T3>(emphasis added).\3\\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\823 F.2d at 636.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Second, in <T3>AGD</T3> the court appears to have approved generic abandonment, providedthat the rulemaking is valid.

Cf. Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 770 F.2d 1144 (D.C.Cir. 1985), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 106 S.

Order onRemand Reaffirming Prior Determination, 42 FERC andpara;<T2>XXXX</T2> (1988) (slip op. at 6).The Commission has undertaken this analysis and has reviewed the finalrule in light of the court's decision in <T3>Con Ed</T3>. The rule would provide abandonment authority in threedifferent situations:1. Termination or modification of the obligations to sell and purchaseby voluntary agreement between the producers and pipelines;2. The grant of authority to pipelines to cease purchasing when the contracthas expired where the producer has not agreed to termination of sales;and3. The grant of authority to producers to terminate sales when the contracthas expired where the pipeline has not agreed to termination of purchases.Abandonment authority available under the first two situations could notadversely impact the pipelines' take-or-pay problem, and in fact wouldbe advantageous to pipelines. Permitting generic abandonment under voluntaryarrangements would help pipelines, because the abandonment would occuronly if a pipeline determines that abandonment would be to its advantage.Take-or-pay relief has often been a <T3>quid pro quo</T3> for pipeline agreements not to oppose abandonmentapplications and will likely be so in connection with agreements to terminateor modify contracts and secure abandonment authority under this rule. Thefinal rule adopted here will enable the parties to carry out this partof their arrangement in an expeditious and timely fashion.In addition the rule will permit permanent as well as limited-term abandonments(LTA's), which now require specific Commission approval, to occur on ageneric basis. The pipelines have often been the parties requesting LTAauthority.\4\\0\<NOTE/> However, the LTA's have been considered as an interim solutionwhile the parties adapt to the new regulatory climate. Moreover, becauseof their limited duration, the LTA's do not permit parties to make long-termplans. The grant of permanent abandonment authority will contribute tothe stability of the market as a whole. Thus permitting permanent abandonmentwhen pipelines voluntarily agree to it can only benefit the pipelines andcould not be adverse to their interests, because they will do so when itis in their interest to so act.\4\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ <T3>See e.g.,</T3> Odeco Oil andamp; Gas Company, <T3>et al.,</T3> 38 FERC andpara; 61,343 (1987); ANR Pipeline Company <T3>et al.,</T3> 38 FERC andpara; 61,046 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ The parties could, of course, enter into arrangementsfor less than permanent abandonment.Similarly, allowing abandonment of a pipeline's purchases from producerswill not adversely impact the pipeline's take-or-pay problem. After theUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruledthat cessation of a certificated purchase requires abandonment authorization,\4\\2\<NOTE/> the Commission has granted such abandonment applicationsfiled by pipelines on an individual basis. \4\\3\<NOTE/> This rule will permit such abandonment on a generic basis.The Commission recognizes that permitting pipelines to abandon purchasesfrom other pipelines could have an adverse impact on particular upstreampipelines. However, that adverse effect is mitigated by the benefit tothe downstream terminating pipelines. Moreover, to the extent that an upstreampipeline's contracts for the purchase of gas from producers have similarterms as do its sales contracts with the downstream pipeline, the upstreampipeline could terminate its purchase obligations with producers underthis rule at the same time the downstream pipeline terminates its purchaseobligations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, <T3>et al.</T3> v. FERC, 803 F.2d 726 (D.C. Cir. 1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ Mississippi River Transmission Corp. <T3>et al.,</T3> 39 FERC andpara; 61,113 (1987), <T3>reh'g denied,</T3> 42 FERC andpara; <T2>XXXX</T2> (1988).As indicated in the NOPR, to the extent that the rule permits pipelinesto terminate their obligations under expired high-priced gas contracts,it will assist them, and in no event place them in a worse position becauseit is in their discretion to so act. When a pipeline abandons its purchasesunder an expired contract, the pipeline's sales contracts with its customerswill not be affected. In this connection, the Commission notes that therule merely authorizes the pipeline to abandon purchases but does not mandateit.The rule does not insulate the pipeline from the consequences of its decisionto abandon purchases, because the decision to release gas constitutes apurchasing practice. The pipeline's customers can challenge that decisionwhen the pipeline seeks to pass through its purchased gas costs or in itsrequired periodic rate filings. Any customer can challenge the pipeline'sdecision to release gas under the ``prudence'' test applicable in suchproceedings. The availability of this right in customers will obviouslybe a consideration by the pipeline in making its decision. Accordingly,the Commission believes that the security of supply of pipelines' customersshould not be adversely affected by the rule, and as noted <T3>supra</T3>, p. 18, security of supply is better served by this rule.\4\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ The rule only applies to purchases by pipelines, anddoes not apply to sales by pipelines. Thus the concern raised in Tennessee'scomments that a pipeline's termination of sales to another pipeline maycause serious supply problems to the latter pipeline, has no basis. Therule grants no such authorization.A third element of the rule permits producers to abandon sales of gas whenthe contract has expired. This abandonment will occur even if the pipelinewould prefer that the gas be available to it for purchase either currentlyor in the future. Two major considerations enter into evaluating the effectthis would have on the take-or-pay issue. The first is the relationshipthat this rule has to Order No. 451. Second is the impact that producer-initiatedabandonment will have on the take-or-pay exposure of (1) non-open accesscarriers and (2) open-access carriers. As explained below the Commissionbelieves that the rule is complementary to Order No. 451 and that benefitsto the public interest from the rule outweigh any adverse impact the rulemight have on the pipeline's take-or-pay problems.This rule will provide producers with another option in addition to OrderNo. 451 if they want to abandon sales of certain dedicated gas and sellit to another for up to the alternative ceiling price for that gas.\4\\5\<NOTE/> Under Order No. 451, producers are permitted to seek thealternative ceiling price established by the Commission for gas pricedunder NGPA sections 104 and 106. However, producers must comply with the``good faith negotiation rule'' before collecting higher prices from currentpurchasers in order ``to provide balanced negotiating rights among parties.''\4\\6\<NOTE/> Under the good faith negotiation (GFN) rule, a producer mayrequest a purchaser to nominate a higher price for any old gas coveredby existing contracts authorizing a higher price, upon establishment bythe Commission of a higher maximum lawful price. The purchaser, in turn,may request renegotiation of the price of any gas sold under the contractplaced on the bargaining table by the producer, as well as all gas soldunder other ``existing'' contracts with the producer which include anyold gas. This enables the purchaser to renegotiate the prices of new (higherpriced) gas dedicated under multi-vintage contracts and provides a balancethat the Commission sought to impart to its rules. If the parties cannotagree, either party may abandon the sale or purchase of the gas at issue.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ As explained <T3>supra</T3> n.25, when NGPA sections 104 and 106(a) gas is abandonedand then sold pursuant to a new contract, the price can be up to the alternativeceiling price.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ Order No. 451-B, III FERC Statutes andamp; Regulationsandpara; 30,748 at 30,686 (June 3, 1987).The producer, however, may decide not to proceed under Order No. 451 withrespect to expired contracts and use this rule, so that the abandonmentis limited to the gas it is seeking to abandon. This rule, however, cannotbe utilized until the contract expires, or is mutually terminated so theproducer must await occurrence of those events, and thus postpone its abilityto obtain the higher price.Under the GFN procedures of Order No. 451, a purchaser could protect itselffrom the immediate effects of having to pay higher prices for old gas byfirst nominating the price it is willing to pay for such gas and by exercisingits rights under step 2 of those procedures to renegotiate downward anyhigh-price gas sold under a multi-vintage contract with the producer. Further,the purchaser can decline to pay the price requested by the seller andallow the gas to be abandoned.There are also certain protections afforded to the purchaser under thisrule. First, the purchaser can unilaterally abandon purchases under anyother expired contract with the same producer, whether or not it is a multi-vintagecontract. Moreover, unlike the GFN procedures of Order No. 451, which grantsthe producer the right to initiate renegotiation of the price, this rulepermits a purchaser to abandon purchases under expired contracts even thoughthe producer has not initiated abandonment with respect to any sales tothat purchaser. Finally, if a producer initiates abandonment under a multi-vintagedcontract, it must necessarily abandon all sales under that contract, includingsale of any high-priced gas, and thus relieve the purchaser of any obligationto continue purchasing such gas.As noted above, this rule will provide producers with another option whenthey desire to abandon gas. We also recognize that this may appear to giveproducers greater leverage over pipelines in their renegotiations of take-or-paycontracts. However, under the rule, where the producer exercises its rightto abandon unilaterally, the pipeline is not required to provide transportationas it is under Order No. 451, so that except for permitting the sale ofthe gas to others, the rule would not change the <T3>status quo.</T3> The Commission does not deem it appropriate underthese circumstances to mandate transportation. To the extent that carriershave not accepted a blanket certificate under Part 284 mandatory transportationunder this rule might exacerbate the take-or-pay problem of such carriers.Accordingly, in order to ensure that the respective negotiating positionsof the parties are not changed, we will not modify the rule to mandatetransportation when the producer initiates abandonment. Thus the rule willpermit producers to terminate any contract that has expired, but will notimpose upon the pipeline a duty to transport such gas.In the event carriers elect to take advantage of the regulations promulgatedunder Order No. 500 to become open-access carriers, they would be requiredto transport the gas that the producer is abandoning. Order Nos. 500, 500-Band 500-C constitute a comprehensive treatment of the take-or-pay problemwhere the Commission, after making a ``thorough examination'' of all aspectsof that problem, weighed and balanced the various competing interests.\4\\7\<NOTE/> Under Order Nos. 500 and 500-B, no take-or-pay credits arerequired for transportation of gas that the producer formerly sold to thetransporting pipeline under a terminated take-or-pay contract and thatis not currently subject to a gas purchase contract between the parties.In Order Explaining Crediting Provisions of Order No. 500,\4\\8\<NOTE/> the Commission clarified that ``Terminated contracts includeall contracts which are no longer in effect, including those which haveexpired, which the parties have voluntarily terminated before the contract'sexpiration, or which have been terminated under Order No. 451.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ Generally, Order No. 500 provides that when gas istransported by a pipeline under Part 284 of the Commission's regulations,the pipeline may treat that volume as a volume taken under any pre-June23, 1987 contract. This would reduce the pipeline's take-or-pay liabilityunder such a contract by the quantity of gas transported. Pipelines mayselect qualifying contracts against which credits are to be applied. Creditscan be applied against liability incurred in the year the gas is transportedor in any previous calendar year, commenced on or after January 1, 1986,in which the pipeline transported gas on an open access basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ 41 FERC andpara; 61,025 (October 16, 1987).We see no reason to modify the provisions of Order No. 500 when a producerterminates its sales obligations under this rule because it could upsetthe delicate balance the Commission has crafted.As we have discussed above, this rule will provide benefits to the marketas a whole, including pipelines and their customers. Increased access tosupplies will put pressure on all sellers of gas, and will make the priceof gas more market sensitive. However, this rule will also be advantageousto pipelines in many situations because it will permit the pipeline toabandon expired contracts covering gas it no longer desires to purchase,and to obtain take-or-pay relief under limited term abandonment programswithout requiring Commission approval on a case-by-case basis. Moreover,because we are not imposing mandatory transportation, when the producerinitiates abandonment, the respective negotiating positions of the producerand pipeline have not been prejudiced. We recognize that in some situations,permitting abandonment when the contract has expired may exacerbate thetake-or-pay problem of an open-access carrier. Nevertheless, this willbe a gradual process because it applies to contracts as they expire. Moreover,the Commission has dealt comprehensively with the take-or-pay problem inOrder No. 500 and concluded that terminated contracts are not eligiblefor crediting. In the Commission's judgment, the overall benefit of therule, combined with the comprehensive treatment of the take-or-pay problemin Order No. 500, adequately addresses the limited impact that this rulemay have on the pipelines' take-or-pay exposure and is consistent withthe court's reasoning in <T3>Con Ed </T3>and <T3>AGD.</T3>C. Relationship of Generic Abandonment to Overall Gas PolicyAs the court noted in <T3>Con Ed, </T3>``by delegating abandonment power in such broad terms,Congress expected that the Commission would develop an appropriate [abandonment]test to fit the regulatory climate.'' \4\\9\<NOTE/> In exercising that authority here, the Commission is convincedthat there no longer is a valid reason to continue an abandonment policythat was promulgated prior to passage of the NGPA.\5\\0\<NOTE/> The existing abandonment policy limits the movement of thegas, and does not increase the amount available to the public. This rulenot only complements the Commission's policy, but is totally consistentwith the Congress' policy under the NGPA, of moving toward a more competitivenatural gas market. Moreover in Order No 436 the Commission ``unbundled''the pipelines' transportation and merchant roles in order to give consumersthe benefit of a competitive wellhead market.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ <T3>Con Ed,</T3> 823 F.2d at 636.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ We would point out that in both of the cases wherethe comparative needs test was articulated, Transcontinental Gas Pipe LineCorp. v. FPC, 488 F.2d 1325 (D.C. Cir. 1973), <T3>cert. denied.</T3> 417 U.S. 291 (1974), and Michigan Consolidated GasCo. v. FPC, 283 F.2d 204 (D.C. Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>364 U.S. 913 (1960), abandonment would have leftthe abandoned party in a shortage situation. Moreover, in the former case,the producer attempted to abandon to obtain a higher price for the gasin the intrastate market. Under the NGPA there is no such advantage inseeking abandonment.This rule will permit gas under expired contracts to be sold to othersbesides the purchaser to whom the gas is dedicated. The rule will giveparties an incentive to utilize their contracting power as the mechanismto determine their gas supply. Further, the rule will free up gas so thatthe nation's entire gas reserves can be used more efficiently. Under theprior policy, where a contract had expired and the purchaser was not takinggas, the gas could not be sold to those who needed and wanted the gas,unless the Commission granted specific authorization.The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to extend the ruleto all first sales, including those to LDC's, because the fundamental benefitsof the rule apply equally to all first sellers and all purchasers. If salesto LDC's were excluded from the rule, as proposed in the NOPR, the rulewould act as a disincentive to producers entering into new contracts withLDC's,\5\\1\<NOTE/> and LDC's would be deprived of the benefit of the releasedsupplies of gas.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ We also note that because most direct sales by producersto LDC's are of fairly recent origin, the rule would not immediately affectmany existing contracts with LDC's.A concern expressed by many commenters and in <T3>Con Ed</T3>, is that permitting a producer to abandon sales under anexpired contract will somehow deprive the pipeline and its customers ofthe benefit of relatively low-cost gas reserves that were subject to thatcontract. Thus many commenters urge that the pipeline customers be affordeda right of first refusal to such gas. First, we should note that even ifsuch a right were granted, the price of the gas would be subject to thealternative MLP under Order No. 451. Given the current and expected marketconditions, gas at that price is readily available in the marketplace.Moreover, the gas that is abandoned is merely a part of a pipeline's generalsystem supply, and is not ordinarily dedicated to any particular customerof the pipeline. Given the fact that pipelines have numerous contractswith many different producers, the unilateral termination of any singlecontract will usually have only a minor influence on a pipeline's weightedaverage cost of gas (WACOG).Furthermore, gas that a pipeline currently is not taking will not necessarilybe available in the future. Many reservoirs are penetrated by many differentproducers who sell to different pipelines. When a purchaser is not takingthe available production, the producer cannot produce its ratable share,and some of that pipeline's reserves will inevitably be lost if other producerscontinue to produce their ratable share. More importantly, as noted inOrder No. 451,\5\\2\<NOTE/> the current lack of a market or of market sensitive pricesmay lead to the premature shutting-in of a substantial number of wells.Thus, permitting abandonment under this rule will not necessarily deprivea pipeline of low-cost reserves that would otherwise be available to thepipeline, because the gas in question might not be available in the future.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ See Order No. 451-A, III FERC Statutes andamp; Regulationsandpara; 30,720 at 30,389-392 (December 15, 1986).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Response to Comments</ITAG>The notice requested comments on the proposed rule, and comments to specificquestions posed by Commissioner Stalon relating to Order No. 436 transportationand Commissioner Trabandt as to whether the proposed rule comports withthe section 7(b) requirements, and whether a generic one year limited-termabandonment should be substituted for the permanent abandonment authorizedby the proposed rule.To some extent we have addressed the comments in the discussion of thetake-or-pay problem(s). Nevertheless we shall first respond to the specificquestions posed and then a respond to the comments. The latter sectionswill elaborate on the issues posed by Commissioners Stalon and Trabandt.The Commission had concluded that only pipelines that have accepted a blanketcertificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing transportationof gas under andSection; 284.221 of the Commission's regulations (Part 284blanket carriers) should be granted authority under this rule to abandonpurchases unilaterally under expired contracts. Allowing only Part 284blanket carriers to abandon unilaterally will help assure that the pipelines'customers have access to the abandoned supplies. As Part 284 carriers,the pipelines will be subject to the nondiscriminatory access conditionin sections 284.8 and 284.9. As Part 284 blanket carriers, the pipelinesmay not discontinue transportation without the Commission's permission.Furthermore, as we have noted above, <T3>supra </T3>p. 32, permitting abandonment by producers when the contracthas expired may exacerbate the take-or-pay problems of such carriers becausethey will be required to transport the gas that is being abandoned. Wehave also recognized the substantial benefits to be derived from the abandonmentof purchases by pipelines available under this rule. Accordingly, we willpermit only pipelines which are Part 284 blanket carriers to utilize therule to obtain the significant benefits provided herein by the abilityto abandon the purchase of gas. Otherwise the rule might act as a disincentiveto pipelines transporting under the nondiscriminatory access conditionsof Part 284. Thus the benefits the rule provides will not only be balancedbetween sellers and purchasers but will also be balanced between purchasersthat have accepted blanket certificates under Part 284 and those that havenot. We believe that this modification provides balance to the rule andfurthers the Commission's comprehensive approach to restructuring and solvingthe problems plaguing the natural gas industry.Furthermore, we have concluded that generic abandonment comports with NGAsection 7(b) and, as noted above, the court in <T3>AGD</T3> approved such an approach stating that the Commission could``establish a system of `pre-granted' abandonment approval.'' \5\\3\<NOTE/> That is exactly what we have done in this rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ <T3>AGD</T3>, 824 F.2d at 1015 n.17.Finally after full consideration, the Commission believes that limitingthe generic abandonment to one year would limit the overall benefit ofthe rule in two important respects. First, such a limitation would preventparties from making long term supply commitments. As we have noted previously,the prior abandonment policy restricted the movement of gas, even whenit was needed by others. Moreover, as shown in the OPPR study, dedicatedreserves can no longer assure a secure supply source to customers becauseof the diminishing amount of such gas. This rule would provide an incentiveto purchasers to use their contracting power to achieve that security ofsupply. Second, abandonment for such a short term makes little sense fromthe viewpoint of administrative efficiency.A. Validity of RulemakingA number of commenters questioned the validity of the rule in light ofNGA section 7(b). These commenters assert generally that section 7(b) requiresthat abandonment can only be authorized after due hearing, and then onlyif it is based upon specific factual findings. Neither of these two statutoryprocedural prerequisites can be satisfied through a generic rulemaking,commenters argue, because section 7(b) requires that the Commission maintaincase-specific review in order to protect the public interest.\5\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ See, ANR at 2, Texas Eastern at 12, and Tennessee at10.Others state that the NGA was enacted by Congress for the express purposeof protecting and ensuring service by interstate pipelines and producersfor the benefit of residential, commercial and industrial users servedby local public utilities.\5\\5\<NOTE/> The purpose of section 7(b), they argue, is to protect thepublic interest in assuring sound and reliable natural gas service throughcareful, case-by-case assessment of the impacts of proposed abandonments.\5\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\ UDC at 6, citing FPC v.

Virginia asserts that a generic finding of public interest is of questionablelegality,\59\<NOTE/> because such action is inconsistent with Congress' actionin the NGPA to retain various categories of first sales under both price<T3>and</T3> abandonment restrictions.\60\<NOTE/> Finally, some commenters state that the legal foundationfor the rule does not constitute an adequate substitute for the ``due hearing''requirement of section 7(b) of the NGA, which does not allow the Commissionto authorize abandonments generically without providing the opportunityfor protests and a hearing with respect to each application.\61\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\Virginia at 3-5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\<T3>See also</T3> New York at 3 and Michigan at 2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\Maryland at 15-29. <T3>See also</T3> Missouri at 2. The rulemaking complies with the requirements of NGA section 7(b). TheCommission has provided the hearing required by section 7(b) in this rulemakingproceeding. All segments of the natural gas industry have submitted commentson the rule. The Commission has considered these comments and other relevantfactors in determining whether generic abandonment would be in the overallpublic interest. Under the prior rule, where the Commission weighed therelative needs of the competing pipelines and their ultimate consumers,there was a need for a case-by-case determination. However, under the rulethe Commission is adopting, there is no need for such hearings, becausethe Commission has determined on a generic basis that the public interestis benefitted by permitting abandonment when contracts terminate.\62\<NOTE/> In <T3>Wisconsin Gas Co. v. Ferc,</T3>\63\<NOTE/> the court held that the rulemaking procedure which permitsparties to participate through comments satisfies the hearing requirementunder the NGA as well as under the Administrative Procedure Act.\64\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\Furthermore, the Commission observes that, at the requestof certain pipelines, it has granted limited-term abandonment authorityto numerous suppliers of the pipeline rather than abandonment for any singlecontract. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Southern Natural Gas Co., 36 FERC andpara;61,401 (1986)and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 36 FERC andpara;61,403 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\770 F.2d 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 106 S. Ct. 1969 (1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\5 U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1976). We have articulated the reasons for the need to permit generic abandonmentand have made the necessary finding that it is in the present or futurepublic convenience or necessity to allow it. As the court noted in <T3>AGD,</T3> there is no bar to the Commission establishing generic criteriafor abandonment which, if met, permit abandonment. Our action does notderegulate the abandoned gas, but merely permits its sale to other buyers,which will have the effect of making some of the gas eligible to receiveup to the alternative MLP under Order No. 451.\65\<NOTE/> Thus our action is fully consistent with the continuationof our NGA jurisdiction over ``old gas,'' because the Commission has determinedthat the alternative MLP is just and reasonable. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\As noted <T3>supra</T3> p. 16, the reason the gas qualifies is because the producerwould enter into a contract which will necessarily be a contract afterJuly 18, 1986. B. Policy Considerations Some commenters maintain that the rule threatens to eviscerate the bargainingpositions of pipelines under the ``good faith negotiation'' procedurespromulgated under Order No. 451.\66\<NOTE/> One commenter states that under the proposed rule producerswill be able to selectively abandon sales of old gas as contracts expire.The abandoned old gas would no longer be subject to the good faith negotiationprerequisite for higher prices but would be eligible for higher pricesunder a new contract to a new purchaser. This would permit producers toobtain high prices for old gas without exposing new gas under multi-vintagecontracts to the good faith negotiation procedures of Order No. 451.\67\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\<T3>See</T3> ANR at 5-6 (suggesting that the rule be modified to clarifythat any unilateral ``old'' gas abandonment by a producer triggers thefull multi-vintage procedures under Order No. 451, or at least will allowpipelines to abandon a like amount of higher priced gas sold by the sameproducer to the pipeline). <T3>See also</T3>, Tennessee at 4 and Columbia at 11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\Tennessee at 4. Other commenters state that, aside from the legality of the proposed rule,the proposal is a poor policy decision. These commenters generally questionthe factual foundations of the proposed rule, including the OPPR studyattached to the NOPR, the underlying policy of deregulation, the workabilityof the program, and whether any new approach is even necessary to achievethe stated goals. Other commenters state that they do not believe that the conclusions inthe OPPR study have been fully supported. They assert that forecasts bymany organizations contradict the study's conclusions, including forecastsby producers that indicate a ten-year time frame for new deliverability,as opposed to OPPR's estimate of the volume and timing of new gas supplyavailable upon diminishment of the gas bubble.\68\<NOTE/> Moreover, it is contended that the Commission's fundamentalpremise that natural gas markets are or can be made workably competitiveis flawed.\69\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\IPC at 7; Laclede at 16-17. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\Laclede at 16-17. One commenter asserts that the Commission's proposition ``that the continuationof service obligations after the contract has expired prevents market forcesfrom operating to the extent envisaged under the NGPA'' not only has nofactual support, but also conflicts with known facts regarding why marketforces are not working to the extent envisaged under the NGPA.\70\<NOTE/> According to APGA, the problem is not that Congress' NGPApolicies are thwarted because 7(b) interferes with contracts, but thatthe contracts themselves prevent market forces from operating to bringprices down.\71\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\APGA at 32-33. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\<T3>Id.</T3> Another commenter, citing the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. McCombs,</T3>\72\<NOTE/> argues that the Commission is in error in asserting thatwhen Congress enacted the NGPA, it intended the forces of competition tosupplant established regulation of jurisdictional services as requiredby NGA section 7(b).\73\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\442 U.S. 529 (1979). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\UDC at 16. Many commenters state the proposed rule is unnecessary because the currentpolicy of granting limited-term abandonment (LTA) achieves the same goals.The case-by-case LTA's are adequate to handle those situations where producers'dedicated gas is being shut in, they argue, especially in view of the optionthat most such producers now have to initiate the good faith negotiationprocedures under Order Nos. 451 and 451-A.\74\<NOTE/> According to WDG, the short term goals of the NOPR can beachieved with the continued use of limited-term abandonments, without sacrificinggas consumers long-term interests in supply security.\75\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\APGA at 15. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\WDG at 13. As stated previously, this rule will achieve the goals in a more expeditiousand effective manner than LTA's. Moreover permanent abandonment providesparticipants with more certainty than the LTA program because it enablesthem to enter into contracts on a long term basis, rather than under thelimited term that the LTA provides. The Commission has considered the various policy arguments and the critiqueof the OPPR study. We find the latter to be without merit. The OPPR studydemonstrates potential supplemental sources of gas supply that could berealized to meet any sudden supply shortage. The study assumes that withderegulated wellhead gas prices, if a gas supply shortage develops, priceswill rise, creating the price incentives to bring on supplemental sources.Such sources will assist in meeting any supply/demand imbalances whilenew deliverability is being developed. Moreover, the commenters' assertionthat new deliverability will require a ten year period is not supportedby reliable studies and appears to be inordinately long for price incentivesto bring on new deliverability. The Commission relies on the experiencegained after enactment of the NGPA that demonstrated that price acted asan effective stimulant to the development of new supplies. We see no reasonto believe it would be any different in the event shortages develop inthe future. The Commission is satisfied that its premise that the natural gas marketcan be made workably competitive is sound, and its policies are aimed atachieving this end. Nothing has been suggested which would alter the Commission'sfinding that permitting generic abandonment benefits the market as a whole.Because we make such a finding, the rule is consistent with the SupremeCourt's decision in <T3>United Gas Pipe Line v. McCombs, supra.</T3>\76\<NOTE/> Permitting generic abandonment will allow gas to servicethe public in the most efficient way. While it is possible that there maybe some adverse consequences for certain individual customers as a resultof this rule, those are far outweighed by the benefits to others. The Commissionbelieves that adequacy of supply can be best insured by allowing gas tobe sold at its market value, and that the public is better served by reducingthe restraints on the movement of gas. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ In that case, the Supreme Court reversed a lower courtholding that, upon depletion of reserves, a producer may abandon saleswithout obtaining any prior Commission approval. The Court reasoned thatpermitting abandonment without prior Commission approval would leave theabandonment determination ``as a practical matter, in the producer's control,a result clearly at odds with Congress' purpose to regulate the supplyand price of natural gas.'' The present case is distinguishable from <T3>McCombs </T3>since no abandonment without prior Commission approvalis here involved. The Commission has in this rule granted prior approvalof abandonments where the contract has expired. Otherwise, Commission authorizationto abandon is required on a case-by-case basis. As discussed <T3>supra </T3>at pp. 28-29, this rule provides producers an opportunityto abandon gas priced under NGPA sections 104 and 106(a) and seek the alternativeMLP under Order No. 451. However, we have pointed out that this rule also provides the purchaserwith certain protections.\77\<NOTE/> Moreover, this rule does not provide mandatory transportationwhen the producer initiates abandonment, as does Order No. 451. The rulealso permits purchasers who have accepted a blanket certificate to unilaterallyabandon purchases under expired contracts. Finally, because the rule appliesonly to expired contracts, the producer must await that occurrence, unlikeOrder No. 451 which permits the producer, and only the producer, to initiatethe procedure any time it desires. For all these reasons, the Commissionfinds that this rule will not conflict with the GFN procedures under OrderNo. 451. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ See <T3>supra </T3>p. 30. C. Take-or-PayMany commenters urge that the rule be modified to deal with the take-or-payissue. A number of commenters assert that where the producer terminates,it should be required to refund any take-or-pay payments or prepaymentspreviously made by the abandoned purchaser.\78\<NOTE/> Another proposed modification is that a pipeline be permittedto credit against its contract take-or-pay obligation for the abandonmentperiod, all volumes that the pipeline delivers to high-priority users.\79\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ Arkla at 3 and 4, ANR at 6; INGAA at 11; and Transcoat 2-3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ Plains at 9. Other commenters urge that in exchange for the opportunity to obtain ahigher price for its gas in the free market and the right to transportsuch gas over the pipeline system, the producer should be required to specificallywaive any or all take-or-pay claims currently outstanding for the volumesto be abandoned. Finally some commenters state that allowing the producer to automaticallyabandon its sales when a contract expires could jeopardize a pipeline'sability to negotiate take-or-pay settlements with respect to the contractbeing abandoned, as well as other contracts involving high-priced gas andmore severe take-or-pay exposure. They assert that it is not uncommon forpipelines and producers to negotiate ``global'' settlements covering numerouscontracts, settlements under which the pipelines can trade increases inprice under low-price gas purchase contracts for producer concessions onhigh-price contracts. The Commission's proposed abandonment rule wouldallow producers to remove from the settlement any low-priced gas whichis or may soon become eligible for abandonment, thereby limiting the settlementsto only high-price contracts.\80\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ Tennessee at 5-6; ANR at 6. As indicated above, the Commission has considered the take-or-pay problemin Order No. 500. That order constitutes the Commission's comprehensivetreatment of the take-or-pay problem. We do not believe that it is necessaryto add any further requirements or conditions to this rule. However, theCommission has recognized the take-or-pay consequences of this rule bynot imposing a mandatory transportation requirement when the producer initiatesabandonment.\81\<NOTE/> The abandonment does not affect liabilities and rights accruedas of the time of abandonment, and any disputes should be settled in accordancewith the appropriate law governing the contract.\82\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ Under Order No. 500, refunding of a prepayment is requiredonly where the pipeline allocates the credits to a different contract,and as a result of the release, the pipeline cannot exercise its make-uprights for the gas for which it has made prepayment. This cannot occurunder this rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ See Order No. 451-A, III FERC Statutes andamp; Regulationsandpara; 30,720 at 30,423.D. TransportationA number of commenters \83\<NOTE/> suggest modifying the proposed rule to require pipelinesto transport abandoned gas. They assert that failure to require transportationwill result in pipelines having monopoly power over transportation services.One small producer \84\<NOTE/> expressed concern that small gas producers would not benefitfrom the rule unless mandatory transportation was imposed.\85\<NOTE/> Other small producers expressed support for the proposedrule but did request modifying the rule to impose transportation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ AP; EME; Citizen; and IG.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ Frank A.

One commenter contends that where a producer has no alternative route toget its gas to market, a refusal by the interstate pipeline to transportthe gas on reasonable terms might constitute a violation of the ``essentialfacilities doctrine'' of the antitrust laws. This commenter submits thatwhere a field is served by one jurisdictional pipeline, that pipeline constitutesan ``essential facility'' under traditional antitrust law, and that failureto provide access to that pipeline (in this instance, to transport gasproduced in that field) constitutes ``undue discrimination'' under section5 of the NGA.\87\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ IP at 61, 62.Pipelines are not common carriers and only have the duty that is imposedupon them by their certificate. The final rule does not change the statusquo except that it permits abandonment under the conditions specified.To require mandatory transportation in instances where the producer unilaterallyterminates might exacerbate the pipelines' take-or-pay problems. However,to ensure that the rule does not act as a disincentive to carriers acceptingblanket certificates under Part 284, the Commission has revised the finalrule so that only a carrier that has accepted a blanket certificate underPart 284 may unilaterally abandon purchases.E. Right of First RefusalMany commenters suggest that the rule should be modified to provide thatthe gas reserves being abandoned be offered on a right-of-first-refusalbasis to the firm sales customers of the pipeline purchaser.\88\<NOTE/> They argue that such a right of first refusal would serveto protect the interests of these sales customers in a supply security.The Commission's goals of achieving pricing by the marketplace would beachieved, they argue, but with the beneficial effect of permitting thesesale customers to determine for themselves the speed with which they wantto make the transition to a total reliance on the free market for gas acquisition.One commenter notes that specific market segments may suffer a declinein reliability of supply due to unavailability of transportation, and thatthe price impact of the proposed rule cannot be quantified. These concernscan best be addressed, they argue, by giving existing firm sales customersthe right of first refusal.\89\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ WDG at 18-19.

The protection the commentersare seeking will be provided by permitting gas to move more freely to thosewho need it, rather than restricting it to those whose pipeline may haveinitially dealt with the producer.\90\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ We note that under NGPA section 315, the purchaser ofany gas that was removed from the Commission's NGA jurisdiction by NGPAsections 601(a)(1)(B), who but for the provisions of that section wouldhave been entitled to continue to receive that gas, has a right of firstrefusal to such gas at the expiration or termination of the contract withrespect to the first sale of such gas. That section has no applicationto this rule because the rule applies only to gas that is dedicated tointerstate commerce and subject to the Commissions' NGA jurisdiction. TheCommission has concluded that at the termination of the contract abandonmentshould be allowed. The right of first refusal is not necessary to protectthe purchaser because the NGPA and the Commission's policies have createdan environment where the purchaser can replace the abandoned gas by purchasesin the open market.F. General Response to CommentsThe prior abandonment policy frustrates the gas market environment createdby the NGPA, and the Commission's policies implementing the NGPA. The priorrule did not increase supplies, but merely exacerbated shortages when theyoccurred. The final rule, on the other hand, affords benefits to all producers,pipelines and consumers. Producers will be able to market gas that is notbeing taken free of the constraint of seeking Commission approval beforethey may act. Pipelines will be relieved of onerous contracts if they haveexpired. Moreover, they, like all other gas customers, will benefit fromthe greater gas supply that will become available as a result of this rule.The Commission believes that security of supply can best be achieved underthe NGPA's schedule of decontrol by permitting producers and purchasersof natural gas to buy and sell gas in accordance with their contractualcommitments, free of the constraints of any requirement to seek Commissionapproval on a case-by-case basis. The mechanism of a free market will provideadequate gas supplies to pipelines to meet their customer's demands, andin the event of a shortfall of supply, gas will be allocated on individualpipelines in accordance with Commission approved curtailment plans.For all the reasons stated above, the Commission also believes that whenparties' gas purchase contracts expire and they are free to terminate theirsale or purchase obligation arrangements either permanently or for a limitedperiod without Commission approval on a case-by-case basis, they will utilizetheir contractual arrangements to ensure that their service commitmentscan be met. Given the limitations on Commission resources, requiring suchindividual approval serves no useful purpose and merely imposes an unnecessarystep that injects uncertainty, and delays the parties from consummatingsales which would benefit the public interest in general.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

I would have preferred that the Commissioncondition producer abandonment on the producer's agreement to refund allprepayments or to allow the purchaser to make up the gas for which it hasmade prepayments.

I also dissent from that part of the rule which limits apipeline's eligibility to initiate abandonment only if it is an Order No.500 blanket certificate holder. This is a significant departure from theNotice of Proposed Rulemaking which had no such qualifying limitation.To ignore take-or-pay relief and refund of prepayments on the one handand then to condition pipeline abandonment on enforced acceptance of ablanket certificate under section 7 appears to me to be grossly unfair.I would not object to conditioning unilateral pipeline abandonment on acceptanceof a blanket certificate if take-or-pay relief is also granted on unilateralproducer abandonment. The effect of the majority decision is that it willinevitably exacerbate the take-or-pay problem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Anthony G.
