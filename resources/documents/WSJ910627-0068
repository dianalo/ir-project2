But the association rejected mandatory testing forhealth-care personnel, including doctors.</LP><TEXT>   In a vote by the AMA's House of Delegates, the group saidit supports testing for acquired immune deficiency syndrome&quot;consistent with testing for other infections andcommunicable diseases.&quot; In doing so, America's most powerfulmedical lobby signaled it is headed toward treating AIDS theway it treats any other communicable illness.   That, however, won't mean across-the-board testing for allhealth-care employees, a prospect estimated to cost billionsof dollars for an already financially overburdened healthsystem. Nor does it mean the AMA will seek congressional orlegislative action to make its guidelines compulsory.   But it does mean the AMA will begin defining just whichlife-style, or professional, factors will trigger testing. Itwill mean future AMA guidelines on frequencies of the AIDStests taken by certain doctors. And it also means thatphysicians who perform the most invasive procedures will bestrongly encouraged to be regularly tested for the AIDSvirus.   The association's directors plan to give details aboutsuch tests by the end of this year.   Raymond Scalettar, a member of the AMA board of trustees,says the association's policy is that &quot;those who are doinginvasive procedures should be tested, and those who havetested positive (for the AIDS virus) shouldn't be doinginvasive procedures.&quot;   The AMA's board had earlier adopted those guidelines. Butthe action at the AMA conference here gives such standardsgreater force because this week's vote encompassed doctorsfrom all 50 states.   The measure seems unlikely to quell all concerns from apublic treated to recent news of patients who apparentlycontracted AIDS from a Florida dentist.   However, the language adopted by AMA members isaggressively in favor of physician AIDS testing, bycomparison with other language previously considered. Oneearlier draft resolution that was rejected called for the AMA&quot;to oppose non-voluntary testing of health care workers&quot; forthe AIDS virus.   The group, which still requires that patients tested forAIDS must first consent to such tests, holds it unethical fora doctor to refuse treatment merely because someone declinesto take an AIDS blood test. In such an event, doctors areexpected to take precautions such as using double surgicalgloves.   The AMA also supported the principle that a doctor has aresponsibility to report to a state board or licensingdepartment any compelling evidence of impaired effectivenesson the part of a colleague. That requirement would includereporting evidence of an AIDS virus-infected physicianengaging in invasive procedures without notifying patients.   Nancy Dickey, another AMA trustee, said she expectshospitals to help enforce AMA guidelines that anAIDS-infected doctor who is engaged in invasive medicalprocedures should either notify patients or changespecialties.   In other action, the AMA called for legislation againstsmoking cigarettes in baseball stadiums. The group also saidit would encourage baseball clubs themselves to ban allsmoking in the interest of health.   The association took other anti-smoking steps, including acall for statutory prohibitions against billboard advertisingfor tobacco products. In addition, the AMA said it wouldlobby for larger health warnings on cigarette packs, plus theinclusion of anti-smoking leaflets inside.</TEXT></DOC>
