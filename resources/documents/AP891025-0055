(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 82-year-old lawyer who representedJim Bakker through much of his fraud and conspiracy trial doesn'texpect to be paid soon by the PTL founder, but relishes thepublicity.   ``Every case I've ever had has been a heart-stopper,'' saidGeorge T. Davis, who has been practicing law for more than fivedecades. ``Those are the only kinds of cases I take.''   Davis gained reknown representing legendary labor leader TomMooney and since has represented accused Nazi war criminals,political prisoners, death row inmates and deposed foreign leaders.   He arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday to represent Rudy Tham, aconvicted Teamster embezzler who allegedly conspired with U.S.District Judge Robert Aguilar to gain a reversal of his conviction.   Aguilar has been charged with using his San Jose, Calif.,judicial office in a racketeering enterprise, in only the fourthindictment to be returned against a federal judge this decade andthe first time the Racketeering Influence, Corrupt OrganizationsAct has been used against a federal judge.   Davis, who sparred with U.S. District Judge Robert Potterthroughout Bakker's trial, said Bakker had released him fromserving as his attorney during the sentencing.   Asked if Bakker had paid him, Davis said, ``How can I describemy compensation? ... He assures me that some day it will be takencare of.''   Davis said Bakker had been unfairly convicted.   ``This case was tried in a lynch mob orientation,'' Davis saidin a telephone interview. ``The only difference between an oldfashioned Southern (lynching) and this one is that the victim isstill alive.''   The case that sealed Davis' reputation, at the age of 32, washis appeal on behalf of labor organizer Mooney, convicted of a 1916bombing in San Francisco.   It was widely believed that Mooney had been framed, and when hewas pardoned in 1939, thousands cheered as Mooney and Davis paradedthrough San Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
