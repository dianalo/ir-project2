The argument arrived in a letter to the Labor Departmentfrom James MacRae, acting head of the budget office'sregulatory-affairs unit. In the letter, Mr. MacRaesidetracked rules proposed by the department's OccupationalSafety and Health Administration to lower workers'permissible exposure to many substances used in agriculture,construction and other industries. He said the proposalsignore how compliance would &quot;affect workers' employment,wages and, therefore, health.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. MacRae's argument, quickly criticized as unrealisticby union and some Labor Department officials, would dilute a1981 Supreme Court ruling that said the government can't killhealth regulations simply because of their cost. Under thetheory, the administration might kill rules on the groundthat their very cost would have adverse health consequences.Even so, the theory still could run afoul of the high courtdecision because it would involve evaluating healthregulations according to cost.   The letter from Mr. MacRae, which was first disclosed bythe New York Times, wasn't directly related to the Bushadministration's current moratorium on many federalregulations.</TEXT></DOC>
