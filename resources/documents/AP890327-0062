Hisashi Shinto violated laws prohibiting company workers fromreceiving money and valuables in exchange for favors, the Tokyopublic prosecutors office charged today.   The affair involves sales by a Tokyo-based informationconglomerate, Recruit Co., of unlisted shares in a real estatesubsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos Co., to more than 150 governmentofficials, politicians and executives. Recipients of the sharesreaped huge profits after the stock price soared later inover-the-counter trading.   Prosecutors also filed today charged Hiromasa Ezoe, formerchairman of the information conglomerate, and his aide, HiroshiKobayashi, with bribing Shinto. Kobayashi allegedly was involved infinancing the transactions as president of First Finance Co., asecond Recruit subsidiary.   The charges were filed after the Tokyo Stock Exchange endedtrading today, but share prices of the Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Corp. already had plummeted to an all-time low before theclosing. The company was once at the top of the Tokyo StockExchange, with total assets estimated at over $1 billion.   Prosecutors allege Shinto helped Recruit expand itstelecommumication business in return for the stocks.   Shinto initially denied knowledge of the stock deal but lateradmitted his involvement and resigned from his position at the headof the telecommunications monopoly.   Prosecutors have arrested 12 people on suspicion of giving ortaking bribes or violating security laws. At least 17 leadingpoliticians _ including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita _ have beenlinked to the scandal, but none has been arrested.   Since the scandal surfaced in July, the popularity ofTakeshita's administration has suffered. Recent polls conducted bymajor newspapers showed the prime minister's popularity plunged to15 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 1987.   Members of the political opposition have demanded he resign.</TEXT></DOC>
