With this definition,the methodology of risk assessment may be separated into four components:(1) the probability of exposure to the agent under a given circumstance(dose precursor); (2) transformation, retention or translocation of theagent in the body (transport); (3) amount of the agent at a specifiedsite (dose); and (4) a quantifiable end point (response). This divisionprovides a framework in which experimental investigations of controlledexposure of animals with the measurement of specific response (toxicology)and field investigations of uncontrolled exposures of man with specificor non-specific responses (epidemiology) may be treated uniformly.</TEXT></DOC>
