I really like the colors.&quot;;    &quot;What else do you likeabout it?&quot;;    &quot;The flowers. I like the flowers.&quot;;    &quot;What about the tree?&quot;;   &quot;Yes, I like the tree.&quot;;    &quot;What else?&quot;;    &quot;I just like it,&quot; I would say,with a conversation-closing sort of voice.;    Now, with a child going aboutthe house singing tuneless self-esteem ditties -- &quot;I'm me. Nobody else but me.There's no one I'd rather be,&quot; etc. -- I read, in the New York Times, thatpraise can be bad for a child, particularly praise that's excessive, phony,undeserved or vague.;    Kids know, researchers have learned, the differencebetween praise designed to make them feel good, and real praise. Feel-goodpraise tends to make them feel bad. &quot;One of the ways that teachersunintentionally communicate to children that they have low ability is bypraising them extremely for minor tasks,&quot; said Dr. Sandra Graham, a professorof educational psychology at UCLA.;    &quot;You're doing really well, Jason. Lookhow many questions you answered!&quot;;    Jason's no fool. He knows the other kidsdon't get praised for a 55 percent score. If half right is good enough to makethe teacher ecstatic, he must really be a loser.;    In an experiment Grahamdevised, school-age children watched a videotape of two students working onarithmetic problems. One child was praised lavishly for doing the work, whilethe other was simply told he'd done a good job. &quot;When we asked the childrenwho saw the videotape which child is less intelligent, they told us it was theone who got all the praise,&quot; Graham said. &quot;They see it as a sign that theteacher doesn't think highly of that child.&quot;;    At home, parents are told notto link love to achievement. I love you just the way you are. Not, I love youif you get good grades, or hit a home run.;    And parents are urged to seizeevery opportunity to boost Jason and Jennifer's self-esteem, so as to preventthem from becoming criminals, prostitutes, drug addicts and dropouts.;    Butwhen that unconditional love is expressed as constant, unconditional praise,unconnected to a praiseworthy act, it can be counterproductive. &quot;You're a goodgirl&quot; -- just because Mommy and Daddy say so -- eventually makes a childdependent on others' opinions, because the child's incapable of evaluatingwhat's good and what's not about her own actions.;    &quot;Children who receivetoo much inappropriate or undeserved praise from their parents tend to becomeless concerned with how well they do tasks, and more concerned with how otherpeople evaluate them,&quot; said Dr. Michael Lewis, a developmental psychiatrist.;   (Of course, &quot;You're a bad girl,&quot; because Mommy and Daddy say so, is worse.);   Lewis worries about praise-addicted students working for grades, not loveof learning. I worry about what happens when the &quot;good girl&quot; hits puberty, andthe people whose opinions guide her life stop being Mommy and Daddy and startbeing other 14-year-olds.;    By contrast, specific and genuine praise fordoing something well -- &quot;You did a good job drawing that picture&quot; --encourages the child not only to draw more pictures but also to try otherareas of competence. &quot;I'm a good picture-drawer; maybe I'll be a goodbike-rider.&quot;;    This research points to an answer to the phenomenon of girls'plunge in academic achievement in mathematics and science in high school,which has been linked to lower self-esteem.;    Parents tend to tell boys theyare good at doing things, and to tell girls they are &quot;good.&quot; So boys are morelikely to be raised to be competent, independent of their relationships, whilegirls are raised to please others.;    And your average teen-age peer groupdoesn't award many &quot;cool&quot; points for acing the math test.;    If girls had toearn esteem in the same way that boys do, they'd be more likely to sweat outthe hard subjects, where what counts is objective mastery.;    In addition,the praise research relates to the controversy over testing. Tests aresupposed to be bad because some students fail them, lowering theirself-esteem. But are students really fooled when they're shielded fromknowledge of how poorly they're doing?;    Like praise, failure should bespecific: &quot;You need to learn how to write an essay,&quot; not &quot;You're stupid.&quot; Aslong as testing serves as a critique of achievement, not an all-encompassingverdict, it will help kids succeed. &quot;You're a good writer!&quot; said untruthfully,leads to permanent failure.;    I got lost the other day in a rural area withno street signs. Finally, I found someone to ask. She didn't say: &quot;You shouldfeel good about your sense of direction!&quot; She told me I was going the wrongway. That was useful information. If I'd refused to ask, for fear ofconfirming I was lost, or insisted that it didn't matter because all placesare equally valid, I'd be nowhere.;    As soon as I read the Times' article, Istopped to calculate whether I had ruined my child's life. I envisioned hertelling the psychiatrist, &quot;And she'd say she liked the picture, but she didn'treally . . . &quot;;    I was heavy on praise, but I always backed it withspecifics -- I had no choice -- and I'm more likely to say &quot;Good job&quot; than&quot;Good girl.&quot;;    Still, if I'd really cared about my daughter's future as anartist, I wouldn't have been so quick to praise her efforts. I would havecriticized her art the way I criticize her writing, which is only slightlynicer than the way my father criticized my writing.;    She doesn't want to bean artist anymore. She wants to be a writer.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Joanne Jacobs column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910708  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,045  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 8, 199100190096,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
