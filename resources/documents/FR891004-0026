Atwood, Director, IntellectualProperty Rights Task Force, 566-8933.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>Title III of Public Law 98-620, cited as the ``Semiconductor Chip ProtectionAct of 1984,'' added a new Chapter 9 to title 17, United States Code (17U.S.C. 901 through 914), providing for protection of mask works that arefixed in semiconductor chip products. A mask work is defined as a seriesof related images, however fixed or encoded, that represent the three-dimensionalpatterns in the layers of a semiconductor chip. It is fixed in a semiconductorchip product when its embodiment in the product is sufficiently permanentor stable to permit the mask work to be perceived or reproduced from theproduct for a period of more than transitory duration. As a condition of the protection extended to mask works under 17 U.S.C.908(a), protection terminates ``if application for registration of a claimof protection in the mask work is not made * * * within 2 years after thedate on which the mask work is first commercially exploited.'' The U.S.Copyright Office has been designated to administer the registration systemfor mask works. The owner of a registered mask work has the exclusive right, under 17 U.S.C.905, to reproduce it and to import and distribute a semiconductor chipproduct in which the mask work is embodied. In addition, pursuant to 17U.S.C. 906, the owner of a particular product made by the owner of themask work may import or distribute or otherwise dispose of or use, butnot reproduce, that particular product without the authority of the ownerof the mask work. The term of protection for the mask work owner is 10years from the date on which the mask work is registered, or the date onwhich the mask work is first commercially exploited anywhere in the world,whichever occurs first. Under 17 U.S.C. 910(c)(1), the Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. PostalService are empowered to separately or jointly issue regulations for theprotection of the rights of mask work owners with respect to importations.These regulations may require, as a condition for the exclusion of articlesfrom the U.S., that the person seeking exclusion take any one or more ofthe following actions: (1) Obtain a court order enjoining, or an order of the U.S. InternationalTrade Commission (USITC) under section 337, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.1337), excluding importation of the articles; (2) Furnish proof that the mask work involved is protected under 17 U.S.C.905 and that the importation of the articles would infringe the rightsof the mask work owner; and/or (3) Post a surety bond for any injury that may result if the detentionor exclusion of the articles proves to be unjustified. Under options (2) or (3), which involve a Customs determination, withoutthe intervention of a court or the USITC, that an imported mask work isinfringing, articles which are imported in violation of the rights setforth in 17 U.S.C. 905 are subject to seizure and forfeiture in the samemanner as property imported in violation of the Customs laws. Any suchforfeited article may be destroyed as directed by the Secretary of theTreasury, except that the article may be returned to the country of exportwhenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the importerhad no reasonable grounds for believing that his acts constituted a violationof the law. The Semiconductor Chip Protection Act (the SCPA) became effective uponits enactment on November 8, 1984. However, 17 U.S.C. 913(a) held the registrationand enforcement mechanisms in abeyance for 60 days. The registration mechanismsand enforcement provisions, therefore, went into effect on January 9, 1985.By a final rule published as T.D. 87-132 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 21, 1987 (52 FR 39217), Customs consideredall three of the options for protection of the mask work owner's rightsunder 17 U.S.C. 905 and decided that it was unable to proceed under options(2) and (3). Instead, Customs amended andSection; 12.39, Customs Regulations(19 CFR 12.39), to add a new paragraph (d), requiring that persons seekingexclusion of infringing semiconductor chip products first obtain a courtorder enjoining, or an order of the USITC under 19 U.S.C. 1337, excluding,importation of the articles. Exclusion orders issued by the USITC wouldbe enforceable by Customs under section 12.39(b), Customs Regulations (19CFR 12.39(b)). Briefly, the reasons given for proceeding in this fashion were that Customslacked the necessary expertise in semiconductor chip technology to makean infringement determination on its own; chips, and any products in whichthey were contained, would have to be detained and disassembled for testingpurposes, which was considered operationally infeasible; and the processof determining infringement would involve a full adjudicatory review requiringan in-depth analysis of highly technical material.In view of the continued existence of infringement of intellectual propertyrights, and the Government's desire to pursue initiatives to encourageadequate and effective protection of those rights, Customs has placed ahigh priority on enforcement efforts in this area. To this end, Customsis acquiring high technology analyzing equipment as well as additionallaboratory personnel. Customs has also created an Intellectual PropertyRights Task Force to develop and coordinate extensive training programs,which are already under way, relating to mask works and other intellectualproperty rights (IPRs). Conversion of a data base for Customs recordationsof IPRs to an automated system should also facilitate the enforcement capabilityfor protecting mask works. Accordingly, under the proposed regulatory revision, the owner of rightsin a mask work would be able to obtain the assistance of Customs in preventingpirated chips from being imported into the U.S. This remedy would be inaddition to, not in lieu of, the owner's other rights and remedies, suchas the right to attempt to secure an injunction against importation froma court or an exclusion order from the USITC under 19 U.S.C. 1337. Customs activist approach to protecting mask works thus contemplates thecreation of a new recordation procedure similar to that for copyrights,while at the same time maintaining the mask work owner's option of requestingCustoms to enforce an order from a court or the USITC. Information as towhat is protected and what is suspected will be required from mask workowners, with a high degree of specificity involving such data as tariffsubheading and model numbers, and detailed descriptions of products. Since protection for mask works parallels that for copyrights, it is proposedto revise part 133, Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 133), to include maskworks in Customs seizure, detention and ruling proceedings. The protectionsafforded mask work owners in andSection; 12.39(d) will thus be expanded andincluded in part 133. For purposes of administrative convenience and consolidation,andSection; 12.39a, covering ``patent import surveys'', would also be transferredinto part 133. The reference to andSection; 12.39a in part 24, Customs Regulations(19 CFR part 24), with respect to fee schedules, would be revised to reflectthe transfer of ``import surveys'' to part 133. Also, proposed andSection; 133.71(b), which is otherwise identical to presentandSection; 133.51(b) (19 CFR 133.51(b)), omits reference to the Americanmanufacturing clause, inasmuch as this is no longer an effective provisionof the U.S. copyright laws. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to any writtencomments (preferably in triplicate) timely submitted.
