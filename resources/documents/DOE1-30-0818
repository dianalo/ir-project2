One of the great challengesis to convert the intermittent and varying energy of these renewablesources into electric power in an efficient and effective way. Some ofthe emerging technologies involve mechanical to electrical energy conversion,which has usually been accomplished through the use of synchronous machinesoperating at a constant input speed and constant frequency. The requirementfor constant input speed is often incompatible with the desire for efficientenergy capture and imposes difficult control problems on the conversionequipment. A more natural approach to the conversion of intermittentand varying energy sources is a conversion system which accepts a variablemechanical input speed and produces the grid required constant frequencyand voltage directly. This program has investigated the doubly-fed machineas a potential candidate to convert a varying input speed to a constantfrequency, constant voltage output. Although this work is applicableto all rotating generation configurations with speed dependent efficiency,special emphasis was placed on hydro and wind power sources. 20 figs.,8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
