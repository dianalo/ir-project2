The standards on tires, windshields, weight and dimensionswould allow autos that met the new norms to be sold freelyacross EC borders. France, Italy and Spain, which have importquotas on Japanese cars, fear this would allow Japanese carsmade in Britain or elsewhere to flood into their protectedmarkets.   Because of the EC's single-market program, the threecountries must abolish their import quotas by the end of nextyear. Japanese auto makers have agreed with the EC to limittheir car sales to 16% of the community market through theyear 2000. But the three dissident nations want furtherassurances from the EC Commission that Japanese auto saleswill be effectively controlled after 1992.   The three urged the commission to limit parallel imports,cars bought by distributors in one EC country and sold inanother. Though parallel imports are to be free after 1992,the commission will propose rules to protect consumers fromshady, crossborder car dealers.                                                                                                          MEXICAN LAND REFORM PROPOSED                                                                                                          President Carlos Salinas moved to reform Mexico'sland-tenure system by proposing to lift the ban onprivate-sector ownership of half the national territory. Hepresented legislation to ease restrictions on use of ejidos,small plots of farmland expropriated from big estates afterthe 1910-17 revolution and given to peasants; the land,totaling 250 million acres, now can't be mortgaged. Thereforms would allow corporations to buy the land or gaincontrol of it through joint ventures, which could improveMexico's inefficient farm system.                                                                                                          RUSSIANS SEE NEW DICTATORSHIP                                                                                                          A majority of Russian residents believe the economy willworsen and a dictatorship will emerge, a Soviet survey shows.The poll, conducted in late September by the independentNational Polling Center, found 67% of the 1,044 respondentsexpected tougher times economically, 59% saw ethnic troubleand 47% further political trouble. Two-thirds of therespondents described current political events as an emergingdictatorship and 38% viewed them as aimed at preserving theold Communist system. One-fourth believed democracy wouldresult. But 41% thought the Russian leadership couldn't pullthe country out of crisis.                                                                                                          HUNGARY DEVALUES ITS CURRENCY                                                                                                          Hungary devalued the national currency, the forint, morethan 5% against major Western currencies and 5.8% against thedollar, effective today. Budapest said the move was needed&quot;to maintain the dynamism of exports,&quot; as it prepares accordswith Western trading groups. As 90% of imports have beenliberalized, the devaluation is intended to protect domesticproducers from competition and the labor force.                                                                                                          INDIA TO RELAX IMPORT CURBS                                                                                                          India will relax the tough import restrictions it imposedin March during New Delhi's worst-ever fiscal crisis to saveits meager hard-currency reserves. The controls are to beeased gradually, perhaps starting this month. By December,foreign-exchange reserves are expected to rise 19% to $2.5billion. The easing will release foreign exchange for privateand public sector imports.                                                                                                          PRAGUE DELAYS STATE SELL-OFFS                                                                                                          Czechoslovakia delayed for about two months the couponsales of companies to the private sector. Finance MinisterVaclav Klaus, who devised the method to make Czechoslovaksowners of state-owned companies by buying coupons to acquireshares, warned that the wait would cause losses and hurteconomic reform. But Prague cited &quot;problems linked to therestitution&quot; of assets seized by the former Communistgovernment. It also moved to year end the deadline for otherprivatization proposals.                                                                                                          ISRAEL TO LIBERALIZE MARKETS                                                                                                          Israel's Finance Ministry and central bank announced stepsto liberalize foreign-exchange and capital markets.   The measures will &quot;remove administrative restrictions ondeposits, property, and capital inflows and outflows . . .which have interfered with the money markets and hampered theeconomy's growth,&quot; the Bank of Israel said. They also &quot;willbring Israel more into line with other industrializedcountries, and will strengthen links with internationalmarkets,&quot; the central bank said.   In capital and money markets, the central bank will reduceliquidity ratios on deposits, relax restrictions on indexedtransactions, and impose, effective Jan. 1, 1993, liquidityrules on government-earmarked deposits in local currency.
