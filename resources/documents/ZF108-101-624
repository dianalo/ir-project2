Keith Ryder, systems administrator at GTE Telecom Inc. in ColoradoSprings, Colo.andP;  Ryder said he hopes that MacX will eventually allow him tointegrate X Window and Mac applications, keeping both on screensimultaneously.andM;Delivery schedules for both products are lagging, however.andP;  MacX will notship until the second quarter at the earliest, Apple officials said, andwould-be beta testers of both MacX and A/UX 2.0 are restless.andM;&quot;I have major projects waiting, and if I don't get something soon, I may go[to another platform],&quot; said a systems engineer who asked to remainanonymous.andP;  Others said Apple has yet to give them a date they will receiveA/UX 2.0 beta software.andM;&quot;I doubt [Apple] will ship A/UX with the IIxi,&quot; said one source, referring tothe high-powered Mac workstation Apple reportedly intends to unveil in March(see story, Page 1).andP;  &quot;But they may announce it then.&quot;andM;Apple did announce that it is lowering the price of its A/UX support line to$1,175 per year for unlimited toll-free calls.andM;Several third-party Mac-to-Unix developers were at the show:andM;andgt;UniSoft, the Emeryville, Calif., company that originally brought the Unixkernel to the Mac, demonstrated a bare-bones, non-A/UX implementation ofATandamp;T's latest version of Unix, Release V.4, running on a Mac.andP;  UniSoftofficials touted the Mac as an inexpensive platform for V.4 development, eventhough Apple has not committed to upgrading A/UX to Release V.4.andP;  The Applesystem supports System V, Release 2.2 and extensions.andM;andgt;list Spa of Pisa, Italy, showed MacNIX, which maps a Mac-like interface ontoUnix terminal sessions.andP;  Owned in part by Apple, list Spa plans to expandinto the U.S.andP;  market in the next few months.andM;andgt;White Pine Software Inc. of Amherst, N.H., demonstrated a color version ofits eXodus X Window server for the Mac.andP;  It should be available in March, thecompany said.andM;andgt;The Wollongong Group of Palo Alto, Calif., demonstrated MacPathWay Access, aMac-to-TCP/IP software gateway; and Cayman Systems Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.,andO;showed its GatorBox Mac-to-Unix gateway.andM;andgt;Paragon Imaging of Lowell, Mass., un-veiled Visualization Workbench, a$3,500 A/UX-based imaging program that follows the X Window interfaceguidelines, while Chantilly, Va.-based IMIX Corp. showed its IMIX ImageManagement System.andM;andgt;Mt.andP;  Xinu Inc. of Berkeley, Calif., introduced K-Spool, software that letsMacs and Sun computers share printers over a network, and Sony Corp.andO;demonstrated its &quot;Worknetting Server,&quot; a Sony NEWS Unix workstation runningas an AppleShare server.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
