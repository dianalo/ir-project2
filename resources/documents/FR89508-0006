However, NFA will not conduct proceedings to deny, condition,suspend, restrict or revoke the registration of any LTM or AP of an LTM,or an applicant for registration in either category, nor will it be authorizedto process a request for withdrawal from registration by an LTM, untilsuch time as the Commission authorizes or requires a self-regulatory organizationto perform direct regulatory responsibilities under Commission oversightwith respect to leverage transactions generally. The Commission anticipatessuch a larger role for NFA with respect to the regulation of leverage transactionsif new entrants to the leverage business are allowed as outlined in theCommission's recent proposed rule amendments with respect to leverage transactions,which would provide for lifting the moratoria on new firms entering theleverage business. Until the leverage business is expanded, the divisionof direct regulatory authority between the Commission and NFA with respectto registration matters involving LTMs and APs of LTMs would be comparableto the current treatment of floor brokers. The Commission has previouslyauthorized NFA by a series of delegation orders to perform the functionof processing the registration applications for all other persons thatmust register under the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'').</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Lawrence B.

Paperwork Reduction Act Notice</ITAG>While the Commission has determined that these final rule amendments donot affect the existing paperwork burden previously approved by the Officeof Management and Budget, the public reporting burden for the collectionof information which includes Commission Rules 3.17 and 3.18 and all otherrules relating to registration of LTMs and APs of LTMs (3038-0023) is estimatedto average 5.17 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The Commissionalso notes, however, that there is no change in burden hours attributableto the rule amendments discussed herein because the amendments simply transfercertain registration processing functions from the Commission to NFA. Sendcomments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collectionof information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to JosephG. Salazar, CFTC Clearance Officer, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581;and to Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3038-0023),Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>The Commission published its proposed rule amendments with respect to leveragetransactions and allowed sixty days for public comment thereon. 54 FR 3476(January 24, 1989). The Commission received nine written comments on theproposals, none of which addressed the issue of NFA assuming the functionof registration processing for LTMs and APs of LTMs. The commenters includedthe U.S. Department of Justice, NFA, two registered LTMs (one of whichsubmitted two written comments), three contract markets and a private attorney.The Commission indicated in the notice of proposed rulemaking that it wasexploring the feasibility of authorizing NFA to perform the registrationprocessing function for the three registered LTMs and their APs withoutregard to whether the leverage moratoria are repealed. 54 FR 3476, 3477n.1.The only registration categories over which the Commission currently hassole regulatory authority are LTM and AP of an LTM. There are currentlythree registered LTMs and approximately 270 APs of LTMs. These numbersare unlikely to change significantly until the Commission lifts its moratoriaon new entrants to the leverage business.The Commission has maintained a separate computer system to process registrationapplications of LTMs and their APs, even though only a small number ofregistrants is involved. The Commission also notes that most of the APsof LTMs are dually registered as APs of futures commission merchants whichare affiliated firms of the LTMs, and thus information about such individualsalready is contained in NFA's registration system. In light of these factors,and the Commission's increasing shift since 1983 to an oversight role ratherthan direct processing with respect to registration matters, the Commissionbelieves that a more efficient use of resources would be achieved if NFAundertook the function of processing and granting applications for registrationin the categories of LTM and AP of an LTM at the earliest practicable time.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Rule Amendments</ITAG>The principal rules governing the registration of LTMs and their APs areRules 3.17 and 3.18, respectively (17 CFR 3.17 and 3.18 (1988)). Most ofthe amendments to those rules changed references from the Commission tothe NFA because the Commission is authorizing NFA to perform the functionof processing and granting the registration applications of LTMs and theirAPs.\1\<NOTE/> NFA will now assume the registration processing functionfor all persons who must register under the Act. Since NFA is specificallyauthorized to perform the registration processing function, NFA is specificallynamed in Rules 3.17 and 3.18, as it is throughout the Part 3 registrationrules.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Since no new applications for registration as an LTM couldbe considered prior to the lifting of the moratoria set forth in Rules31.1 and 31.2 (17 CFR 31.1 and 31.2 (1988)), NFA will only be dealing withapplications in the registration category of AP of an LTM for the timebeing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Proposed amendments to Part 31 would generally refer toa registered futures association, rather than to NFA specifically, becauseit is possible that there could be another registered futures associationfor the futures industry as a whole, or for a segment thereof such as theleverage business. However, we would not anticipate another futures associationbeing registered in the foreseeable future (no applications are pending),so most of the direct regulatory responsibility will rest with NFA, underCommission oversight, under the Commission's proposed amendments to Part31 referred to above.The other amendments to the Part 3 rules eliminate the references to theCommission in those rules where there are currently references to boththe NFA and the Commission. The Commission has amended Rules 3.2 (notificationof registration), 3.21 (fingerprinting exemption), 3.31 (updates), 3.32(new registration requirements), and 3.40 and 3.43 (temporary licensingof APs). Deletions have been made to Rule 3.3, since NFA will set registrationfees for LTMs and their APs instead of the Commission, and Rule 3.20, sincethere are no more registration renewals. Recent changes to the rules providefor perpetual registration of firms and annual information update filings.53 FR 8428 (March 15, 1988).The only Part 3 rule which the Commission proposed to amend which it isnot amending at this time is Rule 3.33 regarding withdrawals. NFA is notbeing authorized at this time to process requests for withdrawal by LTMs,and any such request for withdrawal from the three registered LTMs mustbe filed with the Commission. Therefore, no amendment to Rule 3.33 is necessaryat this time. The Commission anticipates amending Rule 3.33 and authorizingNFA to process withdrawal requests from LTMs, and authorizing NFA to conductproceedings to deny, condition, suspend, restrict or revoke the registrationof any LTM or AP of an LTM, or an applicant for registration in eithercategory, when the Commission finalizes its amendments to the Part 31 rules.At that time, the Commission also anticipates deleting paragraph (g) ofRule 31.5, which currently relates to the denial, conditioning, suspension,restriction or revocation of registration of an LTM or an AP of an LTM.<T3>See </T3>54 FR 3476, 3477.The Commission is also making a technical, conforming change to Rule 145.6to indicate that publicly available portions of registration forms withrespect to LTMs and their APs will be available from NFA.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Related Matters</ITAG>1. Effective DateThe Commission, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) (1982), finds goodcause for making the rule amendments effective less than 30 days followingpublication of this release in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The Commission and NFA have used a specifictarget date of May 15, 1989 to accomplish the transfer of functions discussedherein and it is important to affected persons and for administrative efficiencythat such a specific date be used rather than merely waiting for 30 daysafter publication of this notice. There is no change in the substantiveburden on LTMs and APs of LTMs or applicants therefor, since the resultof these rule amendments is that such persons will now be required to sendthe materials previously provided to the Commission in connection withtheir registration to the NFA instead. We further note that relativelyfew persons are affected since there are only three registered LTMs andapproximately 270 registered APs of LTMs. The three registered LTMs havebeen informed of the adoption of these rule amendments.2. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (``PRA''), 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>. (1982), imposes certain requirements on federal agencies,including the Commission, in connection with their conducting or sponsoringany collection of information as defined by the PRA. In compliance withthe PRA, the Commission has previously submitted certain of the rules discussedherein as part of information collection number 3038-0023. The Office ofManagement and Budget last approved the collection of information associatedwith OMB control number 3038-0023 on June 28, 1988. The Commission hasdetermined that these rule amendments will not change materially the informationcollection burden approved by OMB at that time because the amendments simplytransfer certain registration processing functions from the Commissionto NFA. The OMB approved burden for information collection number 3038-0023,which covers all rules relating to registration of LTMs and APs of LTMs,is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="38">Average burden hours per response</ITAG>.....5.17<ITAG tagnum="38">Number of respondents</ITAG>.....588<ITAG tagnum="25">Frequency of response_on occasion and annually</ITAG>Persons wishing to comment on these rule amendments should contact GaryWaxman, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3038-0023)Room 3228, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-7340. Copies of the informationcollection submission to OMB are available from Joseph G. Salazar, CFTCClearance Officer, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581, (202) 254-9735.3. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>. (1982), requires that agencies, in proposing rules, considerthe impact of those rules on small businesses. The rule amendments adoptedherein would affect LTMs. The Commission has previously determined thatwith respect to FCMs, based upon the fiduciary nature of FCM/customer relationships,as well as the requirements that FCMs meet minimum financial requirements,FCMs should be excluded from the definition of a small entity.\3\<NOTE/> Since LTMs have a somewhat similar relationship with theircustomers as do FCMs, and since LTMs have a higher minimum financial requirementthan FCMs, LTMs should likewise be excluded from the definition of a smallentity. Therefore, pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Chairman certifies that these rule amendments will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See</T3> 47 FR 18618, 18619 (April 30, 1982).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>17 CFR Part 3Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Registration.17 CFR Part 145Freedom of information, Commission records.In consideration of the foregoing, and pursuant to the authority containedin sections 8a(5) and 19 of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C.12a(5) and 23 (1982), as amended by Pub.
