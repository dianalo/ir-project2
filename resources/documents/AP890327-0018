The memorandum of understanding was signed late last week by theNSA's director, Vice Adm. W.O. Studeman, and Raymond G. Kammer,acting director of the National Institute of Standards andTechnology.   Under prodding from Congress, the two agencies have startedworking closely together to review computer security planssubmitted by offices throughout the government for protectingsystems containing sensitive but unclassified data.   The effort has been spurred by mounting concern over so-calledcomputer viruses, including a virus ``attack'' last November thatcrippled more than 6,000 computers connected to the DefenseDepartment's Internet electronic network.   NIST, based in suburban Gaithersburg, Md., serves as a nationalreference and measurement laboratory for the physical andengineering sciences. It performs a wide range of research intendedto benefit U.S. industry.   The supersecret NSA, headquartered at Fort Meade, Md., is thenation's biggest intelligence agency, with a work force topping60,000 employees _ more than all other U.S. spy agencies combined _and a budget said to be upwards of $10 billion a year.   Its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around theworld, encrypting U.S. communications and cracking foreign codes,as well as protecting the security of U.S. computers andcommunications systems.   Kammer said Friday that the agreement ``provides a structure fordiscussions between NSA and us if there are issues that arise wherethere is a conflict between a classified or national security issueand regular civilian data issues. By and large, it's a commitmentby us to work together.''   He noted that the NSA's current position toward cooperating withNIST _ under legislation signed into law early last year _contrasted with the intelligence agency's previous attitude.   ``We went through a bad spot about a year ago,'' Kammer said.``There was a feeling by the then-management of NSA that theComputer Security Act was a problem, something that they opposed.... The management team that's in there now has taken thephilosophy that it's the law of the land, let's get it done. That'sbeen a big and refreshing change.''   Kammer told a congressional hearing last week that as of March13, the joint NIST-NSA review team had received 1,543 computersecurity plans _ 74 from the Pentagon and the remainder fromcivilian agencies.   The General Accounting Office said last September that federalagencies at that time had identified 53,443 computer systems _ anestimated 52,000 of them within the Defense Department _ containingsensitive data.   Testifying before two House Science subcommittees, Kammer saidNIST had been working with the Justice Department and NSA toestablish an ``emergency response capability'' to deal with``malicious software attacks'' such as computer viruses.   Viruses are generally small strings of computer code that can bestealthily inserted into software programs _ and spread widelythrough electronic networks _ to cause computers to malfunction byclogging memory, destroying or altering data, or other actions.   ``For the current fiscal year I have redirected $200,000 tostart up an effort to coordinate responses to computer securityincidents and to create an information clearinghouse,'' Kammer said.   Appearing at the same hearing, the NSA's Studeman said thePentagon has ordered his agency to ``pursue intensive research anddevelopment with the objective of identifying means to countercomputer viruses.''   ``Today there are no known solutions that can guaranteeprotection of a system against malicious software,'' he said.   But Studeman added that ``we believe strongly that the properuse of trusted products, coupled with sound system securitymanagement and increased funding and emphasis in the area ofresearch and development, offers the best hope for preventing,detecting and containing such attacks.''   Provisions of the four-page memorandum of understanding include:   _NIST will draw upon computer technical security guidelinesdeveloped by the NSA.   _NIST will request the NSA's assistance on all matters relatedto cryptographic techniques.   _NSA will carry out research and development programs in``trusted technology,'' telecommunications security, encryptiontechniques and personal identification methods.   _NSA will ``conduct assessments of the hostile intelligencethreat to federal information systems, and provide technicalassistance and recommend endorsed products for application tosecure systems against that threat.''   _NIST and NSA will jointly review agency plans for the securityand privacy of computer systems.   _NIST and NSA will ``maintain an ongoing, open dialogue'' toensure that each organization remains abreast of emergingtechnologies and issues affecting the security automatedinformation systems.</TEXT></DOC>
