They all need to juggle several different projects thatdraw on the same scarce resources.andM;&quot;We have hundreds of books going at the same time.andP;  We need to anticipateresource loads [the degree of use of people and equipment] so we can judgewhen to add additional staff and vendors and when to hold steady,&quot; explainedBrian Scarlett, director of publishing systems at Houghton-Mifflin Corp., theBoston-based book publisher.andM;Houghton-Mifflin uses three different packages to manage projects -- TimeLine, from Symantec Corp. of Cupertino, Calif.; Harvard Project Manager, fromSoftware Publishing Corp. of Mountain View, Calif.; and a custom-writtenbatch-oriented program written in FoxBASE, a product of Fox Software Inc. ofPerrysburg, Ohio.andM;For Jerry Robinson, staff systems analyst at the Systems Division of DynamicsResearch Corp., a company in Andover, Mass., that develops and maintainssoftware for the federal government, fewer projects are involved, butswitching between tasks is rampant.andM;&quot;I manage half-a-dozen people who work on two or three software-developmentprojects and two to four maintenance projects.andM;&quot;In addition, they're preparing proposals and providing proposal support.andO;Nobody is dedicated full-time to any one project for a long stretch, and thedegree to which they work on any particular project will vary.andP;  I always havemore than one priority going,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;To get more resources -- in my case, programmers -- or to get relief fromtaking on a new project, I have to demonstrate that my people are alreadyworking to capacity,&quot; he explained.andM;Robinson has developed project plans for each of the projects he manages withProject Workbench, a package from ABT Corp. of New York.andP;  He links theprojects by treating them as subprojects of a master project.andM;&quot;Workbench provides four summary levels -- the project level which providesoverall information for the entire project, the phase level, the activitylevel and the task level,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;My project leaders are responsible for creating Workbench files which usedifferent activity ID codes for the various stages of the project.andP;  Eachproject leader's file has activity headings which summarize the details ofanalyzing, designing, coding and testing a particular system.andP;  I maintain amaster project which is automatically updated from the activity headings inmy project leader's files.&quot;andM;Chuck Ditter, programming manager of Infinite Graphics Inc., aMinneapolis-based publisher of CAD/CAM systems and provider of engineeringservices, must also balance multiple tasks.andP;  &quot;Our software developmentinvolves several different projects which draw on the same people andresources.andP;  If a project-management program doesn't handle cross-projectresources nicely, I have to do it manually,&quot; he said.andM;Ditter currently uses SuperProject Expert, from Computer AssociatesInternational Inc. of San Jose, Calif.andP;  &quot;Time Line handles multiple projectsby including each separate project as a heading on one big project.andP;  ButSuperProject Expert lets you link separate projects into your currentproject.andM;&quot;The program lets you assign priorities to tasks and outline headings.andP;  Youcan set up your preferences, so that when you level your resources, even if atask is in progress, it can be interrupted by a task with a higher priority.&quot;andM;&quot;When a project-management program is otherwise satisfactory but does nothandle resources across multiple projects, information about each project'sresource usage can be exported to a spreadsheet,&quot; explained Jerry Karr,president of Synergy Consulting Inc., a Lynnfield, Mass., firm specializingin project-management consulting.andP;  &quot;The individual spreadsheets can then beconsolidated into a spreadsheet which displays cross-project resource usage.&quot;andM;This method does not provide automatic cross-project leveling and involvesconsiderable manipulation before the user can see the effect of manuallymoving a task.andM;However, spreadsheet macros can be used to automate the combination of thespreadsheets representing the different projects, Karr explained.andM;He added: &quot;When a manager is examining several projects with a commonresource pool, the manager should not only be concerned with when additionalcontractors must be hired to handle the peaks.andP;  &quot;A manager should alsoexamine the resource loads for points when staff and equipment areunderutilized.andP;  Both sides of the coin must be examined.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
