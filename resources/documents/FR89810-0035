Chrysler alleges that the head impact protection requirements``interfere'' with efforts to develop new ``top mounted'' crash deployedsystems having an air bag module located beneath the top surface of theinstrument panel. The agency seeks data and other information that wouldassist the agency in determining whether to propose such an exclusion fromthe standard.The other issues explored by this notice arise partly out of the difficultywhich the agency has experienced in applying the language of the standardin order to determine whether some portions of the interior in severalvehicle models fall within exclusions from the standard's requirements.The agency's review of the exclusions for ``console assemblies'' and for``areas below any point at which a vertical line is tangent to the rearmostsurface of the panel'' has led it to seek comment on whether to issue aproposal to clarify, narrow or eliminate those exclusions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on this notice must be received by the agency nolater than September 25, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should refer to the docket number and noticenumber and be submitted in writing to: Docket Section, National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,DC 20590.

Telephone: (202) 366-4917.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">The Standard </ITAG>Standard No. 201 specifies occupant impact protection requirements forinterior vehicle components likely to be struck by a lap-belted occupantin a crash, including instrument panels, seat backs, sun visors and armrests.In addition, the standard requires interior compartment doors (e.g., glovecompartment doors) to remain closed during a crash. In order to comply with Standard No. 201's impact requirements, vehiclemanufacturers install energy absorbing materials in the areas of the instrumentpanel within the ``head impact area,'' as defined in 49 CFR 571.3. Therequirements specify that when those areas are impacted by a head format 15 miles per hour (mph), the deceleration of the head form must notexceed 80g continously for more than 3 milliseconds (S3.1). Installationof appropriate energy absorbing materials in the upper and middle surfacesof the instrument panel in order to meet the requirement can prevent ormitigate chest and head injuries resulting from contacts with the panel.Paragraph S3.1.1 of Standard No. 201 sets forth five exclusions from theabove head impact protection requirements. One of these (S3.1.1(a)) isfor ``console assemblies.'' The other four exclusions relate to areas onthe instrument panel which, although located in the head impact area, hadbeen thought to be unlikely to be struck by a vehicle occupant in a crash,due to the location of other vehicle components (e.g., the windshield)relative to the instrument panel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chrysler's Petition </ITAG>Chrysler requests that S3.1.1 be amended by adding an exclusion for the``head impact area determined for the front passenger seating positionsin vehicles that conform to the requirements of Standard No. 208 by meansof air bag systems.'' The petitioner's request apparently stems from itsresearch efforts at exploring ``top mounted'' air bag systems for futuremodel vehicles. Chrysler believes Standard No. 201's head impact protectionrequirements ``interfere'' with the development of their top-mounted system.According to the petitioner, the air bag module for the top-mounted systemmust be located in the head impact area because only there can it rapidlydeploy and be supported with sufficient structure ``to provide a reactionto the high deployment forces, properly direct the deploying air bag towardthe occupant, and * * * provide occupant ride-down'' (i.e., cushion anddecelerate the occupant). The petitioner states that Standard No. 201'shead impact protection requirements ``simply cannot be met in the areaof the rigid module and its support structure.'' Chrysler states that it has attempted to achieve compliance with the headimpact protection requirements of Standard No. 201, but has been unsuccessfulin its efforts. The petitioner states: <ITAG tagnum="21">We have studied the possibility of locating the module beneath thepanel surface and employing a rigid tube to direct the deploying bag tothe panel surface. Our conclusion is that the structural tube rather thanthe module would then preclude meeting the head form impact requirements* * *. Recessing the module is therefore not a solution, and we have notbeen able to determine another. (Petitioner for rulemaking, page 2.) </ITAG>Chrysler believes that top-mounted air bags ``appear to have an advantagein the accommodation of the out-of-position occupant and standing child.''NHTSA interprets this statement to mean that top-mounted air bags initiallydeploy more upward (toward the windshield) than directly rearward, andthat petitioner believes the benefits of this upward deployment is thatthe deploying air bag is less likely than rearward-deploying ones to strikeforcefully an occupant leaning toward or a child standing near the instrumentpanel.  Chrysler further believes Standard No. 201's head protection requirementsare unnecessary because they only duplicate the occupant crash protectionrequired by Standard No. 208. The petitioner believes the front barriertest of Standard No. 208 is ``far more sensitive to the many sources ofoccupant head injury than is the head impact test of MVSS 201.''The agency has determined that the alleged ``interference'' from StandardNo. 201's head impact protection requirements with the development of newair bag systems should be further considered. NHTSA notes that in January1988, the agency denied a petition for rulemaking from Mitsubishi MotorsCorporation which, similar to Chrysler's petition, had requested that NHTSAexclude air bag equipped vehicles from Standard No. 201. (53 FR 780; January13, 1988.) However, unlike Chrysler, Mitsubishi did not even allege thatcompliance with Standard No. 201 interferes in any way with the developmentof air bag technology, or that there is sufficient reason for removingthe protection offered by that standard. Since Chrysler has based its petitionon alleged incompatibility problems between Standard No. 201 and petitioner'sefforts at developing new air bag technology, NHTSA decided to grant Chrysler'spetition.However, although vehicle manufacturers should be allowed flexibility indeveloping complying air bag systems to the extent possible, the agencyis concerned about any potential safety problems that may arise from anamendment to Standard No. 201. Therefore, the agency seeks comments onthe issues raised by the petition before deciding whether a notice of proposedrulemaking should be issued.NHTSA does not agree with the petitioner that the protection afforded byStandard No. 201's requirement for padded instrument panels duplicatesthe occupant crash protection provided by an air bag. Typically, currentair bag systems deploy during a collision at an approximate barrier equivalentspeed of 12 mph. NHTSA believes Standard No. 201 reduces injuries occurringwhen occupants strike the instrument panel in crashes for which an airbag was not designed to deploy, such as under-12 mph frontal crashes; incrashes involving a car whose air bags had been previously deployed, butnot replaced; in rear crashes in which the occupant rebounds from the seatand strikes the instrument panel; or in side crashes or rollover crashes.Data indicate that occupant contact with the instrument panel occurs frequently.Based on 1982-1985 data from the National Accident Sampling System, thereare approximately 2,100 AIS 2 or greater injuries annually resulting fromcontacts between front seat occupants' heads or faces and the instrumentpanel in side impacts alone. NHTSA seeks more information on the possiblesafety effect of amending Standard No. 201 along the lines suggested bythe petitioner.NHTSA requests comments on whether the requested exclusion would have netsafety benefits above the level of safety protection afforded by the existingprovision. The agency notes that Chrysler has presented only limited evidencethat compliance with Standard No. 201 for top mounted systems is impracticableor infeasible, and has not provided alternative suggestions for a proposedamendment, short of a complete exclusion, that might be able to providerelief. However, the agency believes it would not have been appropriateto deny this petition because vehicle manufacturers have begun to acquiretesting experience of crash deployed restraint systems under Standard No.208 which may have produced data or other information on top-mounted orother air bag systems, and potential incompatibility problems between StandardsNo. 201 and No. 208. If information indicates that the Standard No. 201compliance problem alleged by Chrysler could be solved without changingthe provisions of that standard for air bag equipped vehicles, the agencywill consider terminating rulemaking on this petition.The agency is particularly interested in obtaining comments relating tothe questions numbered below. In responding to a particular question, interestedpersons are requested to provide any relevant factual information to supporttheir conclusions or opinions, including but not limited to test data,statistical data and estimated costs and benefits, and the source of suchinformation.NHTSA emphasizes that the granting of Chrysler's petition does not necessarilymean that a rule will be issued. The determination of whether to issuea rule is made in the course of the rulemaking proceeding, in accordancewith statutory criteria. If the agency were ultimately to issue a finalrule, it would do so only after further notice of proposed rulemaking andopportunity to comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issues</ITAG>1. What benefits are foreseen from implementation of top-mounted air bags?How do these benefits compare to those for a conventionally mounted passenger-sideair bag?2. Are other manufacturers planning to use top-mounted air bags at theright front position in passenger vehicles?3. If so, are they experiencing difficulty meeting both FMVSS No. 208 andNo. 201 requirements? Do they anticipate problems in future designs usingtop-mounted air bags?4. Are there feasible design and/or material selections for top-mountedair bag installations which show potential for satisfying head form accelerationlimitations now specified for FMVSS No. 201 compliance?5. What problems in achieving compliance with FMVSS No. 201 are encounteredby manufacturers who currently install an air bag for the front outboardpassenger position? Are these problems limited to top-mounted designs?6. Could top-mounted air bag designs meet S3.1 of FMVSS No. 201 if thetest speed were lowered from 15 mph to 10-12 mph for air bag equipped vehicles?7. Are there data from manufacturers, hospital records or insurance claimsthat would indicate the frequency and severity of head injuries currentlyoccurring in frontal crashes from impacts on the instrument panel in crasheswith delta V's (i.e., reductions in velocity) between 0 and 15 mph?8. If Standard No. 201 were amended as suggested by the petitioner, woulda top-mounted air bag only reduce one set of injuries and increase otherinstrument panel injuries? Would there be a net decrease or a net increasein injuries?9. If Standard No. 201 were amended as suggested by the petitioner, shouldStandard No. 208 require lap/shoulder belts at all positions exempted fromStandard No. 201 for which automatic crash protection is provided by airbags?<ITAG tagnum="84">Areas Currently Excluded</ITAG>The agency is interested in assessing whether existing exclusions in StandardNo. 201 should continue. As noted above, paragraph S3.1.1 of Standard No.201 excludes five areas or objects within the head impact area from theinstrument panel performance requirements. One exclusion is for consoleassemblies. (Paragraph S3.1.1(a).) Another exclusion is for ``[a]reas belowany point at which a vertical line is tangent to the rearmost surface ofthe panel.'' (Paragraph S3.1.1(e).)The agency is interested in determining whether console assemblies shouldcontinue to be excluded from the head impact protection requirements ofthe standard, and even if so, whether more precise language should be proposedto clarify what constitutes a ``console assembly.'' Console assembly designshave changed significantly since the exclusion for console assemblies wasestablished. NHTSA has become aware that some new vehicle interior designshave a structure which would be commonly recognized as a console assembly,since the structure is a low-lying structure mounted on the vehicle floor,lying between the front seats. However, the structure can also extend upwardsto virtually or actually join with the instrument panel in a one-piece,T-shape type of design. Some one-piece designs, such as the Mercedes 260E, have a small indentation or space between the dashboard and the consoleassembly. Other designs, such as the Porsche 928 S4, lack an indentation.In some configurations, identifying where the instrument panel ends andthe console assembly begins is extremely difficult.This difficulty has complicated the agency's applying the existing exclusionof console assemblies to the interior designs in several models (see, forexample, the agency's September 21, 1988 and October 27, 1986 letters toMMC Services, Inc.), and has resulted in NHTSA's reviewing the merits ofthe console assembly exclusion. As a result, NHTSA seeks comment on whetherthe agency should issue a proposal to clarify, narrow or eliminate theexclusion.NHTSA's review of the exclusions of S3.1.1 has led it to consider alsowhether the area described in S3.1.1(e) should continue to be excludedfrom S3.1 of the standard, and even if generally so, whether the agencyshould propose to narrow the exclusion. NHTSA seeks comment on whetherthere would be safety benefits in ending or narrowing the exclusion, andon the difficulties manufacturers would have in designing areas presentlyexcluded by S3.1.1(e) to meet the head impact protection requirements ofS3.1.To make these assessments, NHTSA requests information on the followingquestions:10. Are manufacturers tending toward one-piece designs which incorporatethe form and function of both instrument panel and console assembly?11. Should console assemblies continue to be excluded from the requirementsof S3.1?(a) If yes, why?(b) How can a manufacturer or NHTSA determine where the dividing line isbetween the console assembly and area that is not the console assemblyon one-piece designs? How can Standard No. 201 clarify what is meant by``console assembly'' and ``instrument panel'' so as to facilitate distinguishingone from the other?(c) Even if we could identify where the instrument panel ends and the consoleassembly begins, should Standard No. 201 exempt all of the console fromS3.1, or just a portion thereof? What would be an appropriate portion toexempt?(d) What is the likelihood of an occupant's head hitting a portion of theconsole assembly in a crash?(e) If some or all portions of a console assembly could injure an occupant,would it be difficult for those portions of console assemblies to meetS3.1 of the standard? What design changes would be necessary for compliance?At what estimated cost?12. Should the area described in S3.1(e) continue to be excluded from therequirements of S3.1? What is the likelihood of an occupant's hitting hisor her head in a crash on an area currently excluded by S3.1.1(e)?13. What difficulties would manufacturers experience in designing areaspresently excluded by S3.1.1(e) to meet the head impact protection requirementsof S3.1? What design changes would be necessary for compliance? At whatestimated cost?<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>NHTSA solicits public comments on this notice.
