(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Lithuanian-born tavern owner is soupset about his compatriots' quest for freedom that he changed thename of his popular downtown haunt from Russian Lady to LithuanianLady.   ``It may not affect much, but whatever I can do is important,''said John Rimscha, who came to the United States in 1955.   Rimscha on Tuesday had the name painted over the bar's facadeand ordered his staff to pour the bar's Russian vodka down thedrain. He did the same thing in 1983 when a Soviet fighter shotdown Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Then, he changed the bar's nameto American Lady to protest the incident.   Rimscha, 46, said the tavern's new name will stay at least untilLithuanians obtain their independence, an event he's sure willoccur.   ``How could they possibly not succeed?'' he said. ``They aresuch determined people. They've been fighting for the last 50 yearsfor their freedom.''   He said when that happens, he'll consider returing his bar toits original name. ``But it's more than likely that I'll stay withthe Lithuanian Lady, since I'm of Lithuanian descent.''</TEXT></DOC>
