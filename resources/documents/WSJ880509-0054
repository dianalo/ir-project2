James L. Sievert, Medalist's financial vice president and treasurer, said the letter from a group led by Dr. Michael Katz wasn't a formal offer. In his letter, Dr. Katz said his group held 15.2% of Medalist's 2.3 million common shares and had decided to pursue an acquisition of the Mequon, Wis., company &quot;with the cooperation of Medalist's management and board of directors.&quot; Dr. Katz's letter said he wasn't making a binding offer, but he asked for additional information about the maker of athletic and leisure products &quot;to make the most attractive acquisition offer.&quot;    Mr. Sievert said Medalist's board hadn't altered its position from last month, when it rejected a $20-a-share bid from Houston-based Riverway Industries Co. and said the company wasn't for sale.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Medalist closed at $19.50, up $1.25. </TEXT></DOC>
