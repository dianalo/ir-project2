The latest issue: credit cards.    Protesters have gone eyeball to eyeball with the Citibank subsidiary of Citicorp over the criteria the bank uses in deciding whether to issue a credit card to a student. And the nation's biggest bank has blinked.    Berkeley started rumbling in March when the campus newspaper, the Daily Californian, reported that Citibank was denying credit cards to older students and to certain humanities majors. The bank defended its restrictions, saying they were based on lawful indicators of creditworthiness.    Citibank has issued credit cards to more than one million students at over 1,000 campuses nationwide as part of a marketing program aimed at students between the ages of 18 and 25, says Bill McGuire, a Citibank spokesman. The bank, he says, has found that older students and those majoring in certain fields are poorer payment risks than others, but he declines to specify what courses of study attract more deadbeats.    Federal lawmakers rallied behind the students. Legislation introduced by Democratic Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin and 13 other congressmen would outlaw denial of credit based on field of study. Rep. Kleczka calls the practice &quot;reprehensible,&quot; &quot;narrow-minded&quot; and &quot;capricious discrimination.&quot;    Citibank was willing to compromise. Citing &quot;sensitivity&quot; to student concerns, the bank said it would phase out course of study as a credit consideration but that age would be retained.    Unmollified, committees in Berkeley's student government called for boycotting Citibank and banning its credit-card representatives from campus. They demanded that the bank apologize and drop both restrictions.    Last week, the bank capitulated. A Citicorp representative went before the student senate, where, according to Michelle Lee, the boycott's sponsor, he said the company's policies were legal but dumb and were being dropped.    Citibank's Mr. McGuire confirms the action, saying the bank &quot;didn't take into account the way those policies would be received.&quot;    He says the bank had long planned a change. The Berkeley protest, he says, &quot;brought it together a little more quickly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
