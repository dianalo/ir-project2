Wiles, chairman, said.    The company expects to report revenue more than doubled to about $116 million from $52.9 million.    The big increase in revenue came partly from strong sales of two new products introduced last year, Mr. Wiles and Gerry Goodman, president and chief operating officer, said in an interview. MiniScribe makes data storage devices for personal computers.    One of the products is a 5 1/4-inch 380-megabyte hard-disk drive and the other is a 5 1/4-inch 40-megabyte half-height hard disk drive. MiniScribe began shipping the products in large volumes in the fourth quarter, Mr. Goodman said.    Also helping demand are big orders from Apple Computer Inc., a customer added in 1987, Mr. Goodman said. Sales to Apple accounted for about 10% of MiniScribe's revenue for the year.    The results estimated for the fourth quarter indicate that MiniScribe will report net income for the year of about $31 million, or 82 cents a share, up 37% from year-earlier net of $22.7 million, or 63 cents a share. Revenue for the year soared 96% to about $362 million from $184.9 million.    Mr. Wiles said revenue increases are outpacing gains in net income because the company invested heavily in product development and introductions last year.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MiniScribe closed at $7.50, up 37.5 cents.    Mr. Wiles and Mr. Goodman expect MiniScribe to earn about $49 million or $50 million, or about $1.30 a share, in fiscal 1989, on revenue of about $550 million. </TEXT></DOC>
