No official announcement has been made, but in theamorphous way that difficult decisions often take shape inJapan, leaks and public statements are intensely focusing onsupport for the so-called superconducting supercollider.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're pleased with the progress that appears to be beingmade,&quot; a U.S. official tracking the issue said Friday.   The U.S. has been seeking as much as $1.5 billion fromJapan for the $8 billion Texas complex. Two top Bushadminstration officials have come to Tokyo in the past threemonths to lobby for Japanese support, and it will be one ofthe main priorities during the president's four-day triphere, along with the opening of Japan's rice market andefforts to reduce the huge automobile trade imbalance.   It will be far easier for the government to support thesupercollider than to make meaningful concessions on theother issues the U.S. will raise. The supercollider involvesconstruction of an 87-kilometer ring through which protonswill whirl in opposite directions, eventually smashingtogether to recreate the forces present at the origins of theuniverse.   Despite the intense U.S. pressure, opposition toparticipation in the supercollider project has been strong inJapan. Top government leaders are having trouble securingsupport for the tax increases that would be necessary to fundthe project, as well as a host of other more pressingdomestic priorities. Some Japanese officials resent U.S.demands for &quot;cooperation&quot; after the U.S. already establishedthe structure and location of the project. Japanesescientists also complain that, while the country's corporatetechnology labs are world leaders, the basic science anduniversity facilities are crumbling and badly need new funds.   Indeed, a statement Thursday by an influential committeeof the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said that &quot;cooperationon the supercollider cannot be realized without establishinga new framework to improve the base of the nation's basicresearch.&quot; Still, Japanese officials said the statement,though largely discouraging, was the first formal LDPacknowledgement that cooperation could take place.   Meanwhile, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leadingbusiness daily, cited government sources in its lead storyFriday saying that Japan would agree to a joint supercolliderworking group during Mr. Bush's visit.   Although Japan is trying hard to make a positivecommitment on the project during President Bush's visit, it'snot clear how much it will actually offer. One official saidJapan isn't likely to commit to a specific dollar figure.Both South Korea and the Soviet Union also have formed jointsupercollider working groups without committing any money. Inany event, no money would be budgeted before the fiscal yearbeginning April 1, 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
