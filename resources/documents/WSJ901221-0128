The essentialanswer is this -- that what others do or don't do does notobviate our responsibility to judge for ourselves what isright, and what is in our interests, and to act accordingly.We also need to recognize that not only should we contribute,but unlike many others, we can contribute -- we have arelevant capability to contribute.   I know there will be some who will cavil at the leadingrole being played in the Gulf by the United States. They willsuspect that other nations who participate will only beserving American interests. That view is profoundly mistaken.   The U.S. is certainly playing a leading role, as we wouldexpect from a nation as wealthy and powerful as the U.S.Indeed, we would be disappointed if the U.S. did not. . . .But the U.S. role has been clearly at one in this case withthe wider interests of the international community, asdemonstrated by the support for Resolution 678 in theSecurity Council.   There are even those who have purported to base theirassessment of the Gulf situation on the presumption of moralequivalence between the U.S. and Iraqi positions. . . . Letthere be no ambiguity here -- no &quot;mindless muddying&quot; of thewaters. If it comes to conflict, the international communitywill not be the aggressor. The United States and the otherallies will not be the aggressor. The aggressor is the nationthat took, occupied and annexed Kuwait in August.</TEXT></DOC>
