It's the kind of scene that makes you want to throw back your head and take a deep breath of fresh air. Don't. What you're likely to get is a mouthful of methane.    New Zealand may pride itself on its pristine landscapes and its rigorous environmental standards. It may eschew nuclear energy and build clean hydroelectric plants instead of dirty smokestacks. But that hasn't saved the country from the ravages of polluters.    The villains aren't cigar-chomping industrialists plotting in some multinational board room. They're sheep, millions of them, munching away on New Zealand's verdant hillsides.    Flatulent sheep, to be blunt about it. &quot;Sheep are very efficient methane producers,&quot; says David Lowe, a geophysicist with the New Zealand Institute of Nuclear Sciences. Humans, he says, produce very little.    &quot;If you could hook up a sheep to the carburetor of your car, you could run it for several kilometers a day,&quot; Mr. Lowe says. &quot;To power the same vehicle by people, you'd need a whole football team and a couple of kegs of beer.&quot;    Trouble is, scientists haven't figured out how to hook sheep to cars, so instead of being a useful power source, the ruminants' copious methane output simply creates pollution.    The problem is particularly acute in New Zealand because the country of three million people has more than 70 million sheep. Each produces about five gallons of methane a day.    That means the local sheep population is producing almost 2.5 billion gallons of foul-smelling gas every week, making New Zealand a big contributor to potentially serious environmental hazards.    Analysis of ancient air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice shows that 30,000 years ago the concentration of methane in the Earth's atmosphere was only a third as much as it is today.    Along with carbon dioxide, whose atmospheric presence also is increasing alarmingly, scientists fear methane will contribute to the phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, which could cause a dangerous rise in the Earth's temperatures and even a melting of the polar ice caps. While scientists know that higher levels of carbon dioxide are caused mainly by industry, the source of all the methane remains mysterious.    &quot;One thing's for sure, it isn't just New Zealand's sheep,&quot; says Mr. Lowe. Other ruminants, such as cows, have in their digestive systems the same cellulose-eating bacteria, which produce methane. But the methane rogues' gallery also includes rice paddies, fossil fuels, volcanoes, Amazonian swamps and termites.    But why the drastic increase over the years in methane? Mr. Lowe and his colleague Rodger Sparks, a nuclear physicist, are trying to find out.    Through radio-carbon dating, the scientists can determine the age of various types of methane in the air, distinguishing recently produced gas from methane that is eons old. And by taking atomic &quot;fingerprints&quot; of methanes from various sources, the scientists hope to pinpoint which methanes come from sheep, swamps, people or industry.    But collecting methane samples isn't for the queasy. Sheep methane comes from a local agricultural university that is conducting research into the animals' digestion. The unfortunate sheep in these experiments have tubes protruding from their intestines, which makes methane collection simple, if unpleasant.    &quot;It's horrible to look at and horrible to smell,&quot; says Mr. Sparks, who leaves most of the sample-collecting to Mr. Lowe.    When the scientists need human methane, Mr. Lowe calls at the local sewage-treatment works. The centerpiece of the plant is a 33-foot-high tank, filled to the brim with what the plant superintendent, Chris Butler, politely calls sludge.    The methane that rises from the mess is drawn away down a wide pipe and used to heat boilers that power the plant. Mr. Butler has his own hypothesis about the sudden increase in atmospheric methane. &quot;It must parallel the rise of modern-day politicians,&quot; he says.    To get his specimen, Mr. Lowe, armed with a half-gallon vacuum flask and a dishcloth, gingerly approaches a valve in the pipe. &quot;I've done some strange things in this job, but this is the strangest,&quot; says the scientist, wrapping the cloth around the valve to form a seal as he turns the tap.    A powerful burst of methane hisses forth. The smell is just about as bad as you would expect. Mr. Lowe's face crumples. &quot;One of these days I'm going to have to talk Rodger into doing this,&quot; he gasps.    Mr. Lowe's next sample-gathering task isn't as malodorous, but it can be just as onerous. It requires a trip to what he calls the clean-air factory -- a bleak outcrop named Baring Head, where winds from the Antarctic first hit land after howling across thousands of miles of open sea.    Mr. Lowe gets his cleanest samples during southerly gales. That means he must do battle with blasts of icy wind as he sets up an array of flasks and pipes to trap air samples. &quot;It's probably the cleanest air in the world,&quot; Mr. Lowe boasts. &quot;In the Northern Hemisphere there isn't any clean air left.&quot;    To prove the point, the clean-air factory exports its product. It is hard to know what customs officers make of the apparently empty flasks regularly dispatched to destinations such as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, Calif., where the air is used in carbon dioxide research.    Back at the Institute of Nuclear Sciences, Messrs. Lowe and Sparks reduce the air samples to carbon particles that can be dated. So far, the scientists have found that about 75% of methane in the atmosphere is biological and of very recent origin.    Over coffee in the lab's cafeteria, the two researchers ponder a solution to the world's methane problem. &quot;We can't just continue to use the atmosphere as a garbage dump for five billion people,&quot; Mr. Lowe says.    But a growing world population has to be fed, and that means more rice paddies, more livestock and more methane. &quot;It's hard to figure how you cut down methane emissions,&quot; Mr. Lowe muses glumly. &quot;About all we can do is stop eating.&quot;    Mr. Sparks stares into his coffee cup. &quot;People will resist that,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
