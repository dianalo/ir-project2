DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The giant accounting firm, Ernst andamp; Young, saysit will not appeal a newly upheld Securities and ExchangeCommission administrative action dating from when the firm wasknown as Ernst andamp; Whinney.   On Thursday, an administrative law judge ruled in favor of theSEC and imposed a 45-day ban against new SEC-related assignmentsfor the firm.   In the same decision, Michael L. Ferrante, a managing partner ofthe firm's White Plains, N.Y. office, was censured.   ``This is a very old matter in which the civil litigation wasconcluded many years ago without any payment by the firm,'' aspokesman for Ernst andamp; Young in New York. ``After almost 10 years,we believe it is time to put the entire matter behind us. This willhave no effect on our ability to serve our clients,'' added thespokesman, Mort Meyerson. He noted that Ferrante remains managingpartner of the White Plains office.   Ernst andamp; Whinney changed its name to Ernst andamp; Young and moved itsheadquarters from Cleveland to New York after merging with ArthurYoung last year.   The action stems from SEC findings in 1985 that Ernst andamp; Whinneyengaged in ``unethical or improper professional conduct'' inhandling the financial statements of U.S. Surgical Corp., aNorwalk, Conn.-based medical prodcuts developer and manufacturer.   SEC regulations require companies that sell publicly-tradedstock to have their financial statements certified by outsidepublic accountants to protect investors.   Surgical, which designed and developed surgical staplers andother wound-closing instruments, overstated its pre-tax income by18 percent in 1980 and by 67.8 percent in 1981, allegedly to coverup expenses incurred in protecting patents and battlingcompetitors, the SEC said.   The financial statements were cleared by Ernst andamp; Whinneyauditors.   The firm contended that while ``accounting decisions were madeand auditing procedures were performed whose appropriateness mightbe debatable'' it didn't amount to improper professional conduct.   After 50 days of hearings between Aug. 18, 1986 and March 3,1987, Administrative Law Judge Jerome K. Soffer upheld the SEC.   Soffer ruled that Ernst andamp; Whinney offices in the New Yorkmetropolitan area _ including White Plains _ are barred for thenext 45 days from taking on new clients who will have dealings withthe SEC.   But the firm can continue handling current client accounts.</TEXT></DOC>
