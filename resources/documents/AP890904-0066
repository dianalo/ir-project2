(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Guardsmen with rifles helpedenforce an overnight curfew after a second night of violencefollowed the looting of more than 100 stores by young people in townfor a fraternity festival.   The curfew issued after a Labor Day weekend gathering of studentsfrom mostly black colleges turned violent was lifted this morning.   The resort's main thoroughfare, Atlantic Avenue, was reopened andfamilies began heading for the beach for the last holiday of thesummer.   Officials in this town of 250,000 praised police, but a civilrights leader said officers contributed to the tension that touchedoff the riot.   A 35-minute sweep by club-wielding officers late Sunday addeddozens of arrests to the 160 arrests and 395 citations betweenFriday evening and Sunday afternoon. Police had no immediate figureson the number of arrests overnight.   Two people, both over college age, were shot in the first nightof violence.   ``Last year, everything was real nice. There was no violence ...but this year the place was jammed with police and they werehassling people,'' said Paul Williams, a 21-year-old student fromPhiladelphia's Temple University.   Another witness said some participants chanted a slogan from thehit film ``Do The Right Thing,'' which is about racial violence inNew York City.   ``We will not tolerate lawlessness from anybody,'' Mayor MeyeraE. Obendorf said. ``Let the word go out that Virginia Beach will notstand by and watch as unruly individuals trash our city.''   In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show this morning, the mayorsaid police ``have shown extraordinary restraint'' in makingarrests. She said police had fired no shots and had not used teargas.   She said the city has ``gone out of its way'' to welcome theyoung people gathered for the annual Greekfest, which attractsstudents from up and down the East Coast. She said some students hadcomplaints about the way they were treated, but ``there's no excusefor trashing a city if you're not happy with your circumstances.''   But Jack W. Gravely, president of the Virginia chapter of theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, faultedthe city's tactics as much as ``an element who came to disrupt'' thestudents' gathering.   During last year's Greekfest, police cleared smaller groups ofyoung people from the street. Other large fraternity gatherings haveerupted in violence in the past, including a beach party in Wantagh,N.Y., in July at which three people were shot. And some Floridatowns packed with college students every spring have seen scatteredstreet disturbances, alcohol problems and vandalism over the years.   Sunday night, dozens of officers and 150 National Guardsmen armedwith assault rifles and wooden batons left the Visitors Center forthe beach area two blocks away.   ``Once the police came on the scene, the tension level rose,''Gravely said. ``The students had what I call an attitude ofcontrolled defiance. They did not understand what they had done towarrant this treatment.''   He said Virginia Beach officials should have been better preparedfor the annual gathering of students from predominantly black EastCoast colleges.   City officials said they had no choice but to use force afteryoung people went on a rampage early Sunday down beachfront AtlanticAvenue.   The authorities estimated 100,000 young people jammed a 30-blocksection around 2:15 a.m. When police tried to clear the streets,shots were fired, more than 100 businesses were looted and smallfires were set in the streets, city officials said.   By the time order was restored around dawn, four people werereported injured. They remained in hospitals today, two with gunshotwounds, one critically injured in a balcony fall and one in seriouscondition after an auto accident during the disturbance.   By 6 p.m. Sunday, Atlantic Avenue was again crowded with youngpeople, though many shops were boarded up. Two hours later,officials closed all streets leading into the beach, allowing inonly residents.   A short time later, the guardsmen moved in, followed byexplosions that sounded like firecrackers, causing momentary panicamong about 250 young people.   Bottles were thrown at officers. Ten-man squads of police, backedby an armored state police truck and a SWAT team, began makingarrests.   By 9:30 p.m., hundreds of police in wedge formations swept thebeachfront, with a police helicopter overhead. They were met by ahail of bottles from balconies and parking decks, but cleared thestreets by 11.   ``When they tried to move people, it went crazy,'' said ErrinSmith, 20, of New York. ``People were yelling `Fight the Power!' Atfirst people were just having a good time, but they harassed us fromthe minute we got here.''   ``Fight the power'' is the musical theme of ``Do The RightThing,'' a current movie about racism and the death of a young blackman at the hands of police.   The mayor said the decision to clear the streets was made bycommanders at the scene after reports of looting and shots fired.   Gravely said he and an NAACP attorney were meeting with the mayorat the time and were not told of any looting or shooting.   ``It's been like we're being singled out because we are young andblack,'' said Charles Stone, 23, of New York City.   Merchants denied slighting the students, most of whom they saidwere nice. But some shopkeepers said they were not surprised by thetrouble.   ``We tried to welcome these people. We'd been hearing rumors allweek that something was going to happen,'' said Bobbi Basnight, anAtlantic Avenue merchant.   ``Our problem is we had so many people in a small area,'' saidArnie Cohen, whose shop was spared. ``I don't care if they wereJewish, black or whatever ... with all those people with so littleto do and some of them drinking ... it's a volatile situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
