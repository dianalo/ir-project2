The company now has 4,328franchises, or about one-fourth of Japan's total convenience stores.;   7-Eleven Japan, which last year rang up annual sales of about $7 billion, evenbought out the troubled U.S. parent company of American 7-Elevens earlier thisyear. Analysts are skeptical, however, whether the stunning successes in Japancan be duplicated in the United States.;    &quot;On the surface . . . things mayappear the same in Japan,&quot; said Masashi Wada, a retail specialist at theDentsu Institute for Human Studies. &quot;But the internal systems are completelydifferent.&quot;;    7-Eleven Japan's success stems from a hyper-efficient deliverysystem that ensures the hottest products always are in stock. The wide varietyof goods and services makes the stores something more than a place to pick upa late-night snack.;    For example, a customer can pick up steaming fishcakes, canned tea and rice balls (kept at 68 degrees -- the temperature atwhich research has shown rice tastes best), while paying utility bills andordering Tiffany's products by catalog.;    The stores are always searchingfor new, hit products to cultivate a &quot;fashionable&quot; image. That's why Americanslooking for a Slurpie -- a perennial favorite at U.S. 7-Elevens -- are in fora disappointment. The Japanese stores decided the ice drinks were passe andstopped serving them five years ago.;    About two-thirds of the 3,000 itemssold at a typical Japanese store will change in a year, said 7-Elevenspokesman Hidetoshi Akiyama.;    &quot;If we don't carry the latest products,people are going to come in and think we are a pathetically outdated store,&quot;Akiyama said. He scoffed at U.S. manufacturers which push their wares withlast year's market statistics.;    To make sure the most popular products arealways in stock, each purchase at a 7-Eleven is immediately recorded in acomputer that keeps tabs for the &quot;just-in-time&quot; delivery system.;    Only theitems that are sure to sell get delivered, and only as they are running out.Each store typically receives 12 deliveries daily. No excess products are kepton the shelves, an asset for space-tight Japan.;    The omnipresence ofconvenience store delivery trucks on Japan's clogged roads prompted agovernment study on potential harmful effects of just-in-time delivery,including traffic jams and air pollution. The panel ended up lauding thesystem, noting that each delivery truck was filled to capacity carrying goodsfor several stores.;    It is almost impossible to overestimate the popularityof 7-Eleven and other convenience stores in Japan. They are so popular thatthis season's hit toy is a game called the &quot;Barcode Battler,&quot; with robotheroes named after typical convenience store purchases such as instant noodlesand oolong tea.;    Analysts say predicting how 7-Eleven Japan will fare inits attempt to revive the U.S. 7-Eleven stores is difficult. Koichi Hori, thehead of Boston Consulting Group in Japan, put its chances at &quot;fifty-fifty.&quot;;   The corner convenience store may always remain marginal in U.S. retail,analysts say, primarily because American shoppers tend to patronizesupermarkets.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tokyo  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910722  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  609  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 22, 199100204094,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
