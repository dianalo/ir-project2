 Many conference presentations have defined what is tocome in this area.andP;  Recent examples of this at Seybold events have been fromEfi Arazi of Electronics for Imaging at the Seybold Computer PublishingConference last September and Adriaan Ligtenberg of C-Cube at the SeyboldEuropean Publishing Conference in December.andP;  The recent presentations fromC-Cube and EFI at the Seybold Seminars in Boston are summarized on page 15.andM;Despite all the promise, we have yet to see products in the marketplace,although EFI has shown what its technology can do--see its insert in Volume4, Number 3.andM;There are, however, image data compression products already on the market.andO;An interesting one called Maple Picture Publishing, currently available onlyas a monochrome product, comes from the Norwegian company Image Software A.S.andO;It is noteworthy not only for the results that it generates, but also becauseof its history.andM;Regular readers of our publications will well remember the Norwegian firmSim-X, the first company to show a true WYSIWYG pagination terminal with realfonts on the screen and to offer a device-independent RIP imaging to thescreen, laser printers and high-resolution imaging devices (predating Camexin both cases).andP;  The company showed immense performance in building andoutputting pages, but because it looked at production more from the view ofan engineer than that of a publisher, it failed to satisfy the operationalneeds of the market.andM;Shortly before Sim-X disappeared from the market, it showed the scanning andoutput of images through its RIP, and in doing so showed impressive levels ofdata compression.andP;  The concepts it used had been under development from earlyin the life of the Sim-X project (which started in 1978), although we onlystarted to see the results late in 1985.andP;  We first reviewed its Splan (Sim-XPicture Language) technology at Drupa in 1986 (see the Seybold Report onPublishing Systems, Vol.andP;  15, No.andP;  21), and at IFRA the same year (ibid.,andO;Vol.andP;  16, No.andP;  6).andP;  The technology produced impressive results, but it couldonly run on the proprietary Sim-X platform.andM;In the tests we did at that time, we were seeing compressiion levels of up to82 times; however, the starter image was scanned at a very high resolution of485 samples per inch with an ImagiTex scanner.andM;When Sim-X disappeared, having failed to sell its product to more than alimited number of customers, chief executive Bent Aasnaes bought the rightsto the Splan technology from Sim-X's owners, Kreditkassen, the Norwegianbank.andP;  Since that time, he has been developing a new system running on theMacintosh, using the same data compression principles.andP;  He showed us someearly results of this work last year, and he released the product to themarket during the fourth quarter of 1989.andP;  It data compression and outputquality both appeared excellent, so we decided to take a closer look.andM;In assessing the Maple product, we worked closely with two organizations inScandinavia.andP;  Urban Joner of AB Prepress, our Scandinavian correspondent,carried out the review of the product.andP;  While in Oslo recently, we met withArne Jaramo of Desktop A.S., which publishes the Norwegian desktop publishingnewsletter Desktop Rapporten.andP;  We arranged that he would run a series ofscanning and output tests to assess the level of compression and quality thatcould be achieved.andP;  This testing was run at the premises of Esselte Grafotex.andO;We would like to thank our testers and Esselte Grafotex for their assistance.andM;The Maple Picture Publishing package comprises two elements: the mainscanning and compression software, plus a special driver software package,MapleWriter, that must be installed in the Macintosh's system fodler toenable output of Maple images on a PostScript device.andP;  MapleWriter can besold separately for use by bureaus that wish to output their customer'scompressed Maple images.andM;The Maple software will compress line art and continuous-tone images with 2to 256 gray levels.andP;  It also lets the user view the compressed images, cropand scale them, and adjust the tonal values.andP;  Maple handles only TIFF images.andO;It compresses them by breaking the image up into cells, then storing areaswith the same gray values as vector descriptions.andM;Image Software claims that continuous-tone images are compressed to between10% and 15% of the original TIFF size when stored as Maple files.andP;  The lowestfigure we achieved in our tests was 14.78%; we could have applied a higherdegree of comrpession and had an image with less detail, but we feltadditional compression would degrade the image quality too much.andM;Basically, the higher the scanned resolution, the higher the level ofcompression that can be achieved.andP;  On the Image Software samples, thecompression achieved was as tight as 5% (that is, 20:1) for selected contonesand down to 3% for some line art.andM;In the line art, the scanned resolution was much higher than necessary.andP;  Theresults of our test--showing the size of the original TIFF file and the sizesof the respective Maple MPICT files after different levels of compression,plus the specific compression times--are given later in this assessment.andM;Once scanned, the images are compressed and heled in a vector-based formcalled MPICT.andP;  The MPICT file is held as two images: the compressed image anda PICT screen image.andP;  The MPICT format makes it possible to import imagesinto word processing and page make-up software such as Quark Xpress, AldusPageMaker and Microsoft Word.andP;  Images can also be stored from Within Maple asTIFF or PICT files.andM;Using MapleandM;A TIFF image that has been scanned or created in another Macintosh program isopened within Maple.andP;  The opening process actually starts the compression ofthe image, which is regulated by three parameters set by the user.andP;  Oneparameter controls the accuracy with which the contours are traced; thesecond, how the gray values are calculated; and the third, the smallestobjects that are detected in the compressing process.andP;  Image Software islooking at combining these three functions and making them controllable byon-screen sliders, which would range from selections between high compressionand high quality.andM;When compression is completed, the image is drawn on the screen.andP;  Thecompression time varies depending upon the level of compression required.andP;  Itis actually slower to compress for high quality, generating larger file sizes(32-37% of original size in our test), than it is to go for high compression.andM;Image Software claimes compaction speeds of around 12 KB per seond on aMacintosh IIx.andP;  In our tests, we achieved speeds of between 8.6 KB and 12.45KB per second.andM;Once the image is on the screen, there are additional tools to controlcropping and scaling of the image and to make overall tonal adjustments.andP;  Inthe latter, both lightness and contrast can be adjusted.andM;Scaling and cropping.andP;  An image can be cropped either proportionally orotherwise interactively using the standard Macintosh handles.andP;  The user canalso give the requested width and height values in a dialog box.andM;Scaling is performed interactively or by setting x/y scaling values, and canalso be done proportionally or otherwise.andP;  The manual does not state whatranges of scaling are possible.andP;  At one point, we tried enlarging a pictureup to 8,000%, and Maple computed the image.andP;  However, we did not have enoughmemory to draw the image on screen.andP;  In our tests, we scaled the image to225% for both the screen and the PostScript imagesetter.andM;Tone adjust.andP;  A gradation curve is shown with gray values input on one axisand gray values output on the other.andP;  Tonal range values in and out are givenin dialog boxes, and the image's lightness and contrast are controlled by theslider function.andP;  All changes are global.andM;One can read the tonal values at specific points in the image with a movabledensity readout.andP;  Areas with certain ranges of gray can be detected bysetting the requested density range in the tonal range in values.andP;  Forexample, the user can find highlight areas by specifying 0-10% in the dialogbox for tonal range input.andM;Output.andP;  Images can be output on a PostScript device if MapleWriter softwareis installed in the system folder of the Macintosh driving the RIP.andP;  Thescreening frequency and angle, set from within Maple, give value controls forthe PostScript screening algorithms.andM;MapleWriter converts the MPICT format back to a continuous-tone image foroutput.andP;  Decompression is much faster than compression, taking only 10 to 20seconds for a large image.andP;  It would be ideal for MapleWriter to be residentin the RIP so that only compressed images are passed over the network to theoutput device, but this process would need the Maple structure to become astandard PostScript picture format.andM;One benefit of the Maple format is that it is resolution-and screenfrequency-independent; one can use the same compressed image to output at anyresolution and at different screen values.andP;  For proofing an image, the speedis similar to outputting an image scanned for the low resolution.andP;  The formatcan also be scaled both up and down.andM;In addition to page make-up programs, Maple can also work with imageretouching packages such as Letraset's ImageStudio or Silicon Beach's DigitalDarkroom where changes must be made within the image.andP;  Such changes are madein the uncompressed image before it is compressed or recompressed by Maple.andM;Testing MapleandM;To test the software, we scanned one image at both 200 and 300 dpi, reading256 gray levels, using an Agfa Focus II scanner.andP;  Normally, one would notscan a continuous-tone image at these resolutions for output at only 1,270dpi, because if generates a file that is unnecessarily large and can slowdown the imagesetter.andP;  But for 2,540-dpi output, the additional data canyield better halftones.andM;We output these two images as straight TIFF files for reference, to comparethe compressed Maple results against them.andP;  The output was done at a screenfrequency of 133 lines per inch at 1,270 dpi using a Linotronic 300imagesetter with a PostScript RIP 3.andP;  We then compressed each image threetimes for low, medium and high compression, outputting them each time to theLinotronic imagesetter at 1,270 dpi with the same screening as the TIFFimage.andP;  We noted the size of the image each time.andM;We finally took one of the compressed images, the 300-dpi one with lowcompression, and enlarged it 225% and output it at 2,540 dpi to see if onecould see any compression aberrations.andP;  (In hindsight, we should perhaps havetaken the image with the highest compression to check this.)andM;Who needs Maple?andM;Anyone who handles monochrome scanned images on a Macintosh is a potentialMaple user.andP;  However, it is best for users who scan images in high resolutionand need to output them at various resolutions and sizes without change, andwhere a large number of images are stored in the system.andM;Maple's compression levels are excellent, provided one scans at a highresolution.andP;  At lower scan resolutions, the benefits are not so apparent.andO;The software appears to retain the level of detail that the high scanningresolution generates, while compressing the files to a very manageable size.andO;For example, if we were to scan an image for output at 2,540 dpi with a133-line screen, to be output at a size of 7 inches (17.78 cm) by 9.5 inches(24.13 cm), as in our enlargement test, the file size would be much higher.andO;Incidentally, the output time for this Maple image was 7 minutes, 55 seconds.andM;This ability to hold detail scanned at high resolution while having awell-compressed image is a major benefit of the system.andP;  This wouldparticularly apply where images must be sent to remote sites viacommunications.andM;At present, Maple is only used for monochrome images.andP;  Nothing in thetechnology precludes its use for color, but no work has been done in thisdirection yet.andM;Cost and distributionandM;The prices for the Maple software are 5,735 NOK (Norway); 4,900 SEK (Sweden);395 pounds (UK); and $400 (U.S.).andP;  The current distribution is as follows:andM;* Norway--Image Software has exclusive distribution.andM;* Sweden--Agfa gevaert AB has exclusive distribution.andM;* Denmark--Torsana (a subsidiary of Eskofot) has exclusive distribution.andM;* UK--Heyden and Son has exclusive distribution.andM;* U.S.--Stonehead has exclusive distribution for the VAR market only.andM;The software is also sold in Sweden by TextCenter AB bundled with itsProfessional Designer product, and in the UK by MacEurope with its Siemensscanner.andP;  Image Software retains the rights to sell the product through OEMor VAR agreement into most areas.andM;Version 1.2 of the Maple software is now being shipped; we reviewed version1.1 but ran our tests with 1.2.andP;  The newer version has faster screenpainting; the ability to queue TIFF images for compaction as a batch process;templates for setting size and tone adjustments for the converted images;automatic tone adjustment capabilities for converted images to give the bestpossible contrast; and the ability to cut and past Maple images via theMacintosh clipboard.andP;  This latter feature does not work with all Macintoshprograms because a few (such as MacDraw) limit the size of PICT images thatcan be transferred via the clipboard to 32 KB.andM;Prospects.andP;  There is not doubt that the software fits a major market need.andO;At present there appear to be no real competitors doing what it does, but onemust always look at what is around the corner.andM;The JPEG-based compression products that will be coming from other supplierswork on somewhat similar principles in terms of breaking images into cells,but the technique for handling the cells is different.andP;  These systems willoffer much higher speeds of compression when they are implemented withinhardware such as the C-Cube chip, and we are likley to see suchimplementations built into future imagesetter RIPs (but not right away).andO;Companies will also sell software-only compression.andP;  We are aware of at leasttwo: the EFI product and Kodak's Colorsqueeze for Macintosh.andM;At present, though, Image Software appears to be the first into the market,and from what we have seen, its software provides high data compression whilemaintaining an acceptable level of quality.andP;  As a piece of support software,its price may seem high.andP;  But in terms of the savings it can make in datastorage and transmission times, it appears to be a bargain.andM;Image Software needs to enhance its distribution, particularly in the U.S..andO;and it is clearly looking to do so.andP;  It is also interested in reaching OEMagreements with hardware and system manufacturers to bundle Maple into theirproducts.andP;  It would be ideal, for example, to find MapoleWriter as an elementof a PostScript RIP so the volumes of data to be sent to an imagesetter wouldbe reduced.andM;So far the software has been shown in Scandinavia and the UK.andP;  It was shownfor the first time in the U.S.andP;  in the Stonehand booth at the New ProductsShowcase at the Seybold Seminars last month.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
