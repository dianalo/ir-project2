The report, prepared by the U.S. accounting firm Price Waterhouse and two U.S. law firms, is expected to confirm the parent's earlier claim that it had no prior knowledge of Toshiba Machine Co.'s shipments of sophisticated milling machines to a Leningrad submarine yard.    Coupled with the announcement of details of Toshiba's new, elaborate export-screening program, release of the report could help the giant Japanese electronics producer regain its license -- temporarily suspended by the Commerce Department -- to buy U.S. high-technology products in bulk. Toshiba's actions may also stave off proposed legislative curbs against most of its exports to the U.S.    According to some Japanese newspapers, the report says in part that some European firms sold sensitive technology to the Soviets before Toshiba Machine did.    Both Toshiba documents will be released today here and in Tokyo.    Commerce Department officials, some of whom have seen the report, have yet to comment on the results of Toshiba's three-month internal investigation. The bulk-export license that the department had given Toshiba earlier will remain &quot;lapsed&quot; until the completion of an audit of recent Toshiba shipments of goods purchased from U.S. companies, a department spokesman said.    However, the announcements today could influence a Senate-House conference that will determine whether to tone down a Senate bill prescribing severe trade curbs on Toshiba. The conference meets later this month to debate this portion of the trade bills passed by both houses.    Toshiba is certain to plead that a parent company shouldn't be punished so harshly for a subsidiary's actions that it never endorsed. Toshiba owns 50.08% of Toshiba Machine, but has said it allowed the subsidiary to run its own business.    Although Toshiba won't release a full account of the investigation until today, some Japanese newspapers have picked up a part of the report contending that some European firms sold sensitive machine tools to the Soviet submarine yard even before Toshiba Machine did.    The Japanese press reported that one of the earlier sales was by a French firm called Forest Line. U.S. diplomats confirmed yesterday that a French firm by that name is being investigated by French authorities.    Other Japanese newspaper accounts, also confirmed by U.S. officials, said Toshiba will organize a separate management group to monitor exports by the parent firm and hundreds of its subsidiaries. If such a system is installed, it could be as thorough as any employed by U.S. corporations.    The U.S. high-technology industry, concerned that closing off Toshiba from the U.S. market could backfire on U.S. interests, has begun to lobby Congress for moderation.    The Reagan administration also is opposed to such sanctions. </TEXT></DOC>
