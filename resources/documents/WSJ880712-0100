Leaks and innuendo have kept the investment bank in the headlines for two years, but now Drexel is girding for a fullfledged legal fight, in particular early filing of a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Gary Lynch, head of the enforcement division of the SEC, did get agency commissioners last month to approve a civil complaint charging Drexel, its California-based Michael Milken and three other employees with various violations. Strangely, the complaint was not filed after the commissioners approved it, which experts say is unprecedented. Instead, news of the decision to approve a complaint was leaked.    The evidence so far suggests the case against Drexel may be more risky than a high-yield bond. Early expectations of massive conspiracy charges to bring down the junk bond market have passed. Charges apparently center on stock &quot;parking&quot; to avoid disclosing the true ownership of takeover stock. The big problem is that the star witness for the prosecution is Ivan Boesky.    Part of his plea bargain was to implicate Mr. Milken, one of the few bigger fish around. The key to the case against Drexel is a $5.3 million payment from Boesky. The SEC says this was to pay for stock parking services. Drexel says no, it was for investment-banking services, including research for takeover candidates Boesky had considered. A jury would choose between believing someone Drexel calls a &quot;convicted felon and admitted liar&quot; and Mr. Milken.    U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani has also been investigating these same charges for 18 months, with the possibility of bringing a criminal case like Mr. Lynch's civil one. Mr. Giuliani has already evidently been burned once by an inside trader peddling bad information. Martin Siegel's plea bargain included the fingering of three other investment bankers, but Mr. Giuliani had to drop indictments when he decided he couldn't prove the case. He pledged at the time to bring new indictments &quot;in record-breaking time.&quot; Since more than a year has passed, new charges would indeed break records. It's understandable that Mr. Giuliani doesn't want to bring more charges he can't make stick.    Normally the SEC waits until the criminal prosecutor is ready with his case. Otherwise, the defendants get the huge strategic advantage of questioning prosecution witnesses as part of the civil case before any criminal trial. No doubt Drexel's attorneys would like a double shot at Boesky.    Yet it is not entirely unprecedented for the SEC to seek a civil settlement before a criminal trial. In the case of former White House national security aide Thomas Reed, the SEC coerced a $400,000 inside trading settlement, then was embarrassed four years later when a jury acquitted Mr. Reed on all criminal charges. He did not get back his $400,000.    It looks to us as if the SEC enforcement division wants to handle the Drexel case the same way -- not with a trial but with pressure for a settlement by undermining Drexel's business interests. Since Boesky's deal with the SEC, Drexel has spent $140 million on lawyers' fees and public relations. With Mr. Giuliani's investigation still going on, what is the purpose of getting civil suit approval, and of leaking it? (Incidentally, leaks violate SEC Rules Relating to Investigations, Section 203.2.) If Mr. Lynch does move first with civil charges, Mr. Giuliani would almost certainly be forced to seek to have the criminal trial postponed. This would leave Drexel hanging without its day in court, an ideal way to damage its business.    Indeed, there is evidence that SEC officials have put a heavy hand on Drexel clients. In several recent cases, the agency has refused to approve offerings or proxies until the clients insert language into their prospectuses warning investors that Drexel is involved in the deal. In a letter to Charter Medical Corp., which uses Drexel for financing, it demanded that a proxy statement include &quot;information relating to any contemplated government actions&quot; against Drexel, including &quot;the relief sought.&quot; But no charges have actually been made; lawyers managed to negotiate with the SEC for less strident language in the proxy.    It remains possible, of course, that Mr. Milken and/or Drexel did commit serious securities fraud. But it is also possible that Boesky conned Mr. Lynch and Mr. Giuliani as he conned others. Even laying aside the issue of basic fairness, the allegations are too important to be settled by arm-twisting or a cheap settlement. If either Mr. Lynch or Mr. Giuliani believes there is evidence of violations, he should be prepared to prove it in court. </TEXT></DOC>
