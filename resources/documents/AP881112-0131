Helvetia Boswell _ known by her nickname Vet _ and her sistersMartha and Connee were born and raised in New Orleans.   They gained fame in the late '20s and early '30s for harmoniesand arrangements that filtered jazz and blues into a distinctivestyle that was a precursor of swing music and influenced suchperformers as Ella Fitzgerald, the Mills Brothers and the AndrewsSisters.   ``It was a new sound in its time, jazz violins and small bandsjust before the big bands came in,'' said Spencer A. Tandy, whoproduced a 1980 musical about the sisters called ``The HeebieJeebies,'' the title of one of their hits.   Among the trio's popular songs were ``Dinah,'' ``Yessir, That'sMy Baby,'' ``The Music Goes Round and Round'' and ``Top Hat.'' Theyappeared in three feature films and several shorts.   ``Martha kept the books, Connee played the horses and I was incharge of the house and bought all the clothes,'' Miss Boswellrecalled in a 1981 interview.   She retired from performing when the trio broke up. Martha diedin 1958 and Connee, who had a successful solo career, died in 1976.
