The arrangements include a commitment from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta for a $100 million letter of credit, which will support the notes.    It said Citizens Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, the thrift unit, will offer the notes to institutional investors in $100,000 denominations with either fixed or floating-rate interest rates and maturities ranging from nine months to five years.    Citizens Federal said the notes will be placed by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    The Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta said it is the first time it has made a commitment for a letter of credit to support an issue of medium-term notes by a member institution.    Citizens Federal said that the notes will carry a triple-A rating from Moody's Investors Services Inc., which, along with the Federal Home Loan Bank backing, will allow it to offer the notes at &quot;the lowest possible interest rates.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
