(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DO YOU NEED to insert a special symbol in your word-processingdocuments--say, foreign-currency signs, the Cyrillic alphabet, meteorologicalsymbols, or pointing hands?andP;  Some symbols are available in font cartridgesand downloadable soft fonts, but that's an expensive solution if all you needis one character--and impossible if you want to print something like acompany logo.andM;The most versatile solution is to create LPCHAR.BAS, a BASIC program thatdownloads any character you design to your laser printer, where it can beused by your word processor.andP;  Our method works on virtually anyHewlett-Packard LaserJet-compatible laser printer (most are).andP;  The processinvolves four steps:andM;* Draw the symbol on graph paper to represent laser-printer dots.andM;* Encode the symbol into numeric values.andM;* Place the values into the accompanying listing for LPCHAR.BAS, and run theprogram to load the character into the printer's memory.andM;* Select the symbol with a special code sequence in your word processor'stext file whenever you want it to appear.andM;We'll illustrate these steps by preparing the copyright symbol ([C]), auseful symbol that's not always available on font cartridges.andM;Graphing a SymbolandM;Most laser printers operate at a resolution of 300 dots per inch.andP;  The mostcommon laser font is Courier at 10 characters per inch, which translates toeach character being about one-tenth of an inch wide, or 30 dots.andP;  Typically,10-cpi Courier is printed at six lines to the inch, which allows 50 dots fromthe baseline of one line of text to the next.andP;  The [C] we'll create is a goodmatch for many fonts.andP;  At 26 by 26 dots, it's well within the range of thetypical Courier character.andP;  Once you've mastered creating your owncharacters, you can adjust the size to match other fonts.andM;To create the character, start by plotting it on graph paper.andP;  Mark off a32-wide-by-30-high matrix on the paper--8 by 7 1/2 inches.andP;  Fill in squaresin the pattern of the character you want to create.andM;The grid representing the copyright symbol is shown in Figure 1.andM;Encoding the SymbolandM;Next, convert the dots represented by the filled-in squares into numericvalues that you'll insert into LPCHAR.BAS.andP;  Each group of eight horizontaldots has a value determined by adding two other numbers, one for the firstfour dots in the group and one for the second four dots.andP;  The number for eachgroup is determined by matching the pattern of the dots to the scheme shownin Figure 2.andP;  The number that matches a group depends on whether the patternis for the first group of four dots or the second.andM;For example, consider an eight-dot group such as the one that appears in line4 of the copyright sketch:andM;The chart in Figure 2 shows that the value for the pattern in the first fourdots is 48 and the value for the second pattern is 15.andP;  The sum of the twonumbers is 63, the value for the set of eight dots that appears in the secondcolumn of numbers to the right of the sketch.andM;Because the copyright character has 30 rows (including white space), we endup with 120 values (4 times 30) that describe the character to the laserprinter.andM;The 120 values for the copyright symbol are listed next to Figure 1.andP;  Thefirst 24 values in this example are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 224, 0, 0,63, 252, 0, 0, 248, 31, 0, 1, 192, 3, and 128, representing the first sixrows.andM;The next step is to create LPCHAR.BAS, the program that will send yourcalculated values to the printer.andP;  Copy the code in the listing using anyeditor or word processor that lets you save files in ASCII format, ordownload the listing (PRTLOG.COM) from data library 1 of our PC/Contactforum.andP;  You'll need to change two portions of the program from the way it'slisted here.andP;  The two values in line 100 (shown in red in the listing) arespecific to our copyright sign example: The first is the number of rows (30).andO;Change the character (32 for the [C]) and the second is the number of rows(30).andP;  Change them to match the matrix you create for your character.andP;  Lines101 through 110 (shown in blue) contain the values for the eight-dot groupsthat make up the [C].andP;  Replace them with the values you obtain for your ownsymbol.andM;The program assumes your printer is attached to LPT1.andP;  If it's on anotherport, replace LPT1: in lines 98 and 99 with LPT2:, COM1:, or COM2:.andM;Once you've saved the program as LPCHAR.BAS, run it using the BASICinterpreter on your machine (generally named GWBASIC.EXE, BASICA.COM, orBASIC.EXE).andP;  Enter this command at the DOS prompt, using the name of yourinterpreter:andM;GWBASIC LPCHAR.BASandM;This downloads the symbol to your laser printer.andP;  You need to run the programonly once whenever you turn the printer on.andP;  The character is then residentin the laser printer's memory until the printer is turned off.andM;Printing the SymbolandM;Once you've run the BASIC program, you can print the character at any time byinserting a special printer control command into the text of a document.andO;Such commands alert the printer to perform special tasks during ordinaryprint jobs.andP;  The command in this case is the sequence Escapeandamp;f3X.andP;  Forexample, to print &quot;Copyright [C] 1991 PC/Computing&quot;, the text must read,&quot;Copyright Escapeandamp;f3X 1991 PC/Computing&quot;.andM;How you insert the Escape character depends on your word processor.andP;  InXyWrite, for example, the character is created by simply pressing the Esckey; but most other word processors use the Esc key for their own functions.andO;If your word processor is among those, try holding down the Alt key as youtap 27 on the numeric keypad.andM;The exact method for using printer controls is generally in a wordprocessor's manual, under the heading &quot;Printer Control Commands.&quot;andM;William Barden, Jr., is a PC consultant and the author of more than 30computer-related books.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
