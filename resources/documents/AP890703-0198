The meeting was rescheduled for Wednesday at 11 a.m.   European diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thedelay was caused by a U.S. bid to tone down language in a resolutionon Israel's expulsion of eight Palestinians from ``deplore'' to``regret.''   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,would not comment on language used in the draft resolution and saidonly, ``We will continue to hold discussions.''   Other diplomatic sources suggested the United States wanted tohold off on the resolution until after Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc meets to consider Shamir'speace plan. Shamir has proposed elections in the occupiedterritories to choose Arab representatives to negotiate limitedautonomy with Israel.   Last week Israel deported eight Palestinians from the Gaza Stripand West Bank to neighboring Lebanon, saying they were leaders ofthe Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.   The United States, as one of five permanent members of theSecurity Council, could veto any measure critical of its Israelially. Last year the United States supported one resolution callingon Israel not to expel Palestinians and it abstained from anothermeasure of condemnation.   Israel has deported 55 Palestinians from the occupied territoriessince the Palestinian uprising began 19 months ago. At least 538Palestinians and 23 Israelis have been killed in the so-calledintefadeh for independence from Israel.   The proposed resolution, sponsored by Syria and the Arab League,deplores the deportations by Israel. It calls upon Israel to ensureimmediate return to the territories of deported Palestinians and tostop deporting Arab civilians.   It cites the Geneva Convention of 1949, which covers treatment ofcivilians in time of war and prohibits their explusions.   The council members are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,Ethiopia, Finland, Nepal, Malaysia, Senegal, Yugoslavia and the fivepermanent members, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,China and France.</TEXT></DOC>
