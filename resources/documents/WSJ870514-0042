After an early decline, Allegis shares yesterday rose $1.875, to $69.625, as investors apparently decided to discount the anti-takeover provisions of the agreement with Boeing, which include measures that could make the aircraft maker a major shareholder of Allegis. Trading in Allegis stock on the New York Stock Exchange was extremely heavy, with more than 6.7 million shares, or about 12% of the total outstanding, changing hands.    Rumors persisted that one or more investors were taking sizable positions in Allegis stock, though the identities of the rumored buyers couldn't be immediately confirmed.    &quot;They are not totally out of play,&quot; said Henry G. Van der Eb, chief executive officer of Mathers andamp; Co., a Chicago investment firm. &quot;But they have put a lot more pressure on any potential acquirer.&quot;    The main weakness of the Allegis-Boeing pact apparently has less to do with its structure or details -- which analysts characterized as reasonably ironclad -- than questions about whether Boeing would follow through on provisions that would allow it to block a takeover. Some traders apparently view the Boeing pact as mostly an elaborate bluff.    Boeing officials yesterday seemed to give support to such views by saying that the aircraft maker hasn't any interest in running United Airlines. A Boeing spokesman said, &quot;We do not under any circumstances intend to be involved in the management of United Airlines.&quot;    Doubts also were raised about the wisdom of any effort by Boeing to get too close to United. Although the aircraft maker has an obvious interest in building a strong relationship with the big airline, it also can't afford to alienate its other airline customers.    &quot;It's important to note that this arrangement doesn't commit Boeing to do anything,&quot; said one airline analyst.    Allegis management assented to giving an equity option to Boeing mainly in order to stave off a proposed buyout of United Airlines by the United pilots association, according to sources close to Allegis.    As previously reported, the financing arrangement gives Boeing notes that are convertible into Allegis common, equal to as much as 16% of the total outstanding, or into a new issue of Allegis preferred. Among other things, the preferred shares would carry the right to approve asset sales.    Despite the Boeing development, Jamie Lindsay, an officer of the pilots group, said the group &quot;intends to proceed with our plan to buy the airline.&quot;    The full details of the financing arrangement won't be made public until today or tomorrow at the earliest, Allegis officials said.    But despite yesterday's trading activity, there were indications that Allegis is willing to go the distance to ward off buyouts by either its pilots or other rumored parties. Sources close to Allegis said the company has mentioned that it would be willing to sell Boeing a controlling stake, if necessary, to ward off a hostile bid.    There also were reports that Allegis is holding other anti-takeover measures in the wings, including arrangements with other suppliers that would be similar to the Boeing pact. One possibility that was mentioned involves General Electric Co., which produces jet engines.    As part of the unusual $1.5 billion aircraft purchase and $700 million financing arrangement announced Tuesday by the two companies, Allegis gave Boeing an option to acquire as much as 30% of Allegis's common. The Allegis board also could vote to allow Boeing to buy more than 50% of Allegis's common to ward off an unfriendly takeover offer or one that would break up Allegis, said a source familiar with the transaction. Besides United, Allegis's principal operating units are its Westin and Hilton hotel chains and its Hertz Corp. units.    Boeing and Allegis officials said they were confident that the transaction would clear all regulatory hurdles. But that message apparently was lost on some traders who snapped up Allegis stock late yesterday on rumors that there was a strong chance U.S. regulators would block Boeing from owning substantial equity in Allegis.    However, few legal experts and industry analysts expect that the Transportation Department would have any clear reason to block Boeing ownership in Allegis. Under Section 408 of the Federal Aviation Act, the department has to give prior approval to an aircraft manufacturer that wants to acquire 10% or more of an airline's voting stock, a department official said.    The two companies, which have enjoyed a close relationship, hammered out the details of the financing package aimed at preventing a hostile takeover during the past two weeks, sources said.&quot;They were going to buy the Boeing aircraft anyway,&quot; said one source, &quot;but I doubt it would've happened in this form.&quot;    Richard Ferris, Allegis chairman and chief executive officer, and Allegis's board endorsed giving Boeing an option to become the largest Allegis shareholder if Boeing would help Allegis block a hostile offer, the source said. The two companies also believe that the pact has substantial commercial and financial benefits for each.    Analysts said Boeing could benefit from the pact with Allegis beyond the record order for 11 of its 747-400 jumbo jets. One airline industry lender speculated that Boeing also will be the front-runner when United replaces its fleet of nearly 140 smaller 727s, a size plane it could have ordered from McDonnell Douglas Corp. or Airbus Industrie.    Boeing is providing the financing as &quot;an accommodation to a long-term customer,&quot; he said.    United needs new wide-body planes on its Pacific routes to compete with Singapore Airline and Japan Air Lines, but couldn't afford to do it with debt given its existing debt load, the lender said.    He said that United has bought some time to pursue its strategy of integrating its airline, hotel and car-rental businesses. &quot;It's a grand strategy, but by God it's going to take five years to see if it works. I don't know if (Mr. Ferris) bought that much time&quot; with the Boeing package.    ---   Scott Kilman and Jeff Bailey in Chicago and Laurie P.
