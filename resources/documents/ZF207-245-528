 ''Intel introduced a 1.2 million transistor chip.andO;First, it's too expensive.andP;  Second, it's not a RISC chip.andP;  And third, itdoesn't represent a break with the past.''andM;To which I reply: 1) Not really.andP;  2) It's RISCy enough.andP;  3) That's the point.andM;To take these issues in reverse order, I think the true importance of thei486 is that it's both revolutionary and evolutionary.andP;  It offers arevolutionary improvement in integration and performance (by a speed factorof 2-to-4) without requiring customers to tear all the wires out of theirboxes and start over.andM;Moreover, the announcement of the i486 should clear up much of the confusionin the software industry.andP;  Previously, software developers didn't knowwhether to write for the 286, 386 or the unannounced i486.andP;  Given the highdegree of compatibility between the 386 and the i486, the message is clear:Develop for the 386 architecture; it will be the platform of the 1990s.andM;The world is moving to the 386 architecture.andP;  It would be foolhardy for theend user to buy anything but a 386 (be it a low-end 386SX or a high-endi486).andM;My conclusion is based on the current uncertainty about operating systems.andO;Although many analysts have made predictions about what the dominantoperating system will be in three years and beyond, nobody really knows.andP;  ButI do know that it could be DOS (still), OS/2 or Unix -- all of which run onthe 386 family.andM;So where does this leave the 286?andP;  Though the 286 market isn't going to die,I expect it will eventually be relegated to a laptop and entry-productsegment.andP;  The problem with the 286 is that it's old technology.andP;  It doesn'trun Unix efficiently; it doesn't permit multitasking; and it's not that muchcheaper than the 386SX ($50 to $80 for the 286 vs.andP;  $80 to $90 for the386SX).andM;In addition, the i486 is designed as a platform for multiprocessing, whichcould have some significant and positive implications for Intel's growthrate.andM;From the perspective of RISC enthusiasts, the i486 is not a pure RISCmachine.andP;  In my view, this concern misses the point and reflects afundamental misunderstanding of the needs of computer system vendors.andP;  Indesigning a product that incorporates a microprocessor, all developers havethree requirements: speed, cost and compatibility.andP;  However, each developergives these criteria different weightings.andM;If you want compatibility, use the 386/i486 family.andP;  If you want speed, buythe Intel 860, the new supercomputing high-end processor.andP;  And if you wantgood price/performance, look at the 960 family.andM;Three for the Price of OneandM;Some observers have said that at $950 the 386 is too expensive.andP;  If acustomer just wants to buy a 386 chip, that's true, but that's not the targetmarket for this product.andM;Actually, the i486 represents a bargain in many respects.andP;  If a customer isdesigning a high-end computer, the i486 could actually yield some savings.andO;The i486 essentially integrates the 386, the 387 coprocessor, the 385 cachecontroller and 8K-byte static RAM, which if purchased separately would costmore than the i486.andP;  This doesn't even include the savings in testing,printed circuit board space, wiring and reduced failure rates.andP;  Somecompanies, such as Sun Microsystems, which designs all three of these chipsinto its 386i, are very interested in the i486.andM;Intel benefits from this scenario in two ways: First, it can sell one chipfor the price of three, resulting in better margins, assuming the yields onthe i486 match those of the 386 family.andP;  Second, it provides an effectivedeterrent against rumored and announced clones of the 387 and 385 chips.andM;Finally, the fact that the computer industry will not have to grind to a haltas it prepares for the next generation implies a favorable outlook for theindustry leaders, Compaq and IBM, in particular.andM;----------The Market Maker column is shared by Andrew J. Neff and Ruthann Quindlen.andO;Neff is a vice presidentandM;at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., specializingandM;in tracking the microcomputerandM;industry.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
