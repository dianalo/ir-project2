The Justice Department agency said the six-month increase of23,240 prisoners would require adding 900 new prison beds everyweek.   Lawrence Greenfeld, bureau director of correctional statistics,attributed the increase partly to stricter parole supervision, witha higher number of parole violators being returned to prison, and awider use of mandatory minumum sentences for repeat drug offensesand other serious crimes.   The gain in female prisoners reflects a trend toward morefrequent drug convictions among women than men, Greenfeld said.   He said the six-month increase in all federal and stateprisoners fit the pattern of similar growth in the past two orthree years, resulting from revised sentencing guidelines by thestates.   The largest percentage increases from Jan. 1 through June 30occurred in Rhode Island, which reported 17.9 percent more inmates;the District of Columbia had 13.6 percent more, and New Hampshire,12.8 percent, the bureau said.   California, which added 5,146 inmates for a 7.7 percent increaseduring that period, accounted for 22 percent of the nationwidegrowth in the prison population and housed nearly 12 percent of allfederal and state prisoners, the report said.   Another record reported by the bureau was the number ofprisoners with sentences of more than one year _ 237 per 100,000U.S. residents _ compared with 139 such prisoners at the end of1980.   The bureau said the number of female inmates grew 6.7 percent sofar this year, compared with 3.9 percent for males.   Since 1980, the number of female prisoners has increased 130percent to a total of 30,834 last June 30. Male prisoners increasedby 81 percent in the same period, to a total of 573,990, the bureausaid.   During the full year ended June 30, state prison populationsgrew by 6.2 percent, reaching 555,666 inmates, while the number offederal prison inmates increased by 3.2 percent to a total of49,158.</TEXT></DOC>
