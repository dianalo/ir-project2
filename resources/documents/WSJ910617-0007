Sounding alternately bitter and glum, U.S. District JudgeGerhard Gesell said in a hearing in federal court here Fridaythat the prosecutor faces nearly insurmountable legalobstacles in his bid to restore the conviction, which was setaside by a split three-judge federal appeals panel.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;You must realize,&quot; Judge Gesell said to Michael Bromwich,an attorney with the Iran-Contra independent counsel'soffice, &quot;there is a very slight possibility that the ablestgroup of lawyers in the world could meet the standard set bythe court of appeals. I don't believe there is anyone Iknow.&quot;   &quot;We'll give it our best shot,&quot; the prosecutor answered.   &quot;One wonders what it is that you're trying to accomplish,&quot;the judge said to Mr. Bromwich in concluding the hearing afew minutes later.   The Supreme Court last month let stand the appellate courtdecision to set aside Mr. North's conviction on three counts.The appeals court ordered Judge Gesell to review trial andgrand jury testimony against Mr. North to determine whetherwitnesses were influenced by the former Reagan aide's 1987testimony before Congress. Mr. North had testified tolawmakers with the understanding that he wouldn't beprosecuted based on what he told them.   Judge Gesell reluctantly instructed that the review wouldbegin in September with testimony from former NationalSecurity Adviser Robert McFarlane, the central witnessagainst Mr. North. With help from other Reagan administrationofficials, Mr. North planned and executed secret sales ofarms to Iran and used some of the profit for covert aid tothe Nicaraguan rebels known as contras.   Under the appeals court ruling, the special prosecutor,Lawrence Walsh, must prove that the testimony of each witnessagainst Mr. North wasn't affected in any way by the formerWhite House aide's widely publicized congressional testimony.&quot;The government has a very heavy burden,&quot; Judge Gesellcommented Friday.   Underscoring his remarks, the judge asked Mr. Bromwich ifthe prosecution had decided whether to try to reindict Mr.North if the original conviction isn't reinstated. Mr.Bromwich said he hadn't discussed the issue with his boss,Mr. Walsh. The judge, again hinting that Mr. Walsh ought toconsider ending the case, then invited Mr. North's lawyers tofile a motion to dismiss the charges at an unspecified pointin the future.   At one point when Mr. Bromwich was standing alone beforehim, Judge Gesell said, &quot;People lose cases. There is a lot tobe said for accepting your loss and going ahead.&quot;   The judge praised Mr. North for completing 1,200 hours ofcommunity service as part of his sentence. The former Marinelieutenant colonel, who served as a staff member of theNational Security Council, wasn't sentenced to any prisontime.   Mr. North's defense team smiled often and seemed pleasedby the proceedings. &quot;This case should end,&quot; defense lawyerBarry Simon declared during the hearing.</TEXT></DOC>
