An announcement from the residence of Robert Runcie, archbishopofCanterbury, said the church had organized the mission at theinvitation of the Iranian government.   The delegation is scheduled to leave Sunday and meet withhigh-ranking Iranian officials in Tehran.   A Foreign Office spokesman said: ``We have been informed but notconsulted. As far as we are concerned it is a privately organizedvisit.''   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing inLebanon and it is believed that most are held captive by members ofthe pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, movement.   One of the missing Britons is Terry Waite, 49, Runcie's foreignaffairs adviser, who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, during his fifthmission to seek the freedom of abducted Westerners.   Waite had previously negotiated the release of 10 captives inthe Middle East, including prisoners in Iran and Libya.   The other kidnapped Britons are John McCarthy, 31, a televisionjournalist missing since Feb. 17, 1986, and Alec Collett, 64, a NewYork-based journalist who disappeared March 25, 1985, while onassignment for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.   An Islamic extremist organization claimed Collett had beenkilled, but his body has not been found and there has been no proofthat he is dead.   Brian Keenan, 36, from the British province of Northern Ireland,was abducted April 11, 1986, while walking to the AmericanUniversity of Beirut where he worked as an English teacher. Heholds an Irish passport.   The longest-held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who waskidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985.   Iran and Britain reduced their diplomatic staffs last summer ina series of retaliatory expulsions following the beating of aBritish diplomat in Tehran and the shoplifting arrest of an Iranianenvoy in Britain. Iran now has only one diplomat in London andBritain has one in Tehran.   The four lawmakers in the mission to Iran are Cyril Townsend andRobert Hicks of the governing Conservative Party; Thomas Clarke ofthe Labor Party and Lord Tordoff of the Social Liberal Democrats.   Runcie spokeswoman Eve Keatley said John Lyttle, from Runcie'spublic affairs office, was instrumental in arranging the mission.She said Lyttle was in Iran and met with senior government figures.   ``The group is not going to negotiate for the return ofhostages. It is a fact-finding mission to find ways to improverelations with Iran which could lead to the freeing of Terry Waiteand the other British hostages,'' Mrs. Keatley said.   ``We have repeatedly made it clear we are not prepared to beparty to any deal which would indicate in any way thathostage-taking pays dividends,'' she added.   On June 10, Britain and Iran agreed during talks in London tocompensate each other for damages to their diplomatic offices.   The British Embassy and consular officers in Tehran were damagedby mobs in the late 1970s and the Iranian Embassy in London wasburned in 1980 during a commando assault to rescue hostages in thebuilding.   Under the agreement, Britain will pay Iran the equivalent of$3.2 million and Iran will pay Britain $1.6 million.   Waite's brother, John Waite, said of the church mission: ``I amsure this would be Terry's way to advance the cause of thehostages. He is on record as saying that he didn't believe in deals.   ``But he was a great believer in discovering the other person'spoint of view and finding common ground. That is what thedelegation is all about.''   The Friends of John McCarthy, a group formed to push for hisrelease, also welcomed the mission.   ``We support all efforts aimed at bringing the hostages home. Weare glad that this mission is being organized under the auspices ofthe Church of England,'' said a spokesman.   ``We hope that dialogue with the Iranian authorities will helpto create an atmosphere for the release of hostages.... Thismission underlines the need to talk to all those who can aid theirfreedom.''</TEXT></DOC>
