But if any would-be President wants to look like an actual leader, he ought to make the pledge Stephen Glazier suggests nearby: If elected, and unless or until someone stops me, I will veto all extraneous parts of any bill that reaches my desk (see related editorial: &quot;A Plank Bush Should Stand On&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 12, 1988).    Mr. Glazier takes as his text the Constitution's second veto clause, Clause 3 of Article I, Section 7. It says that not only bills, but &quot;every Order, Resolution or Vote&quot; must be presented for the President's signature or veto. No President has invoked this clause as authority to veto individual items within a bill, but by now there probably is no other way out of the procedural crisis that afflicts the federal government. This is the time for some leader to lead, for some President to act like a President.    Mr. Glazier's advice was offered to George Bush, who clearly understands the problem and was interested enough in Clause 3 to exchange correspondence. Instead of grasping the nettle, Mr. Bush seems to be deemphasizing the item veto and turning to spending-freeze commercials. The Clause 3 suggestion would work just as well for Jack Kemp or Mike Dukakis, or, for that matter, any or all of the contenders. What is it that holds Presidents and would-be Presidents back from a bold assertion of power to cure a problem so plain in contemporary history?    &quot;The lawyers have persuaded me that the practical problems of asserting the kind of veto you suggest or of framing it properly for judicial resolution are too great for a Vice President personally to cut through,&quot; Mr. Bush wrote Mr. Glazier. &quot;I would like to consider as a campaign issue legislation to bind the Congress to a principle of 'one committee, one bill.'&quot; This would be great, but Congress is hardly likely to agree, nor indeed should the legislative branch be responsible for asserting the power of the executive branch.    Mr. Bush's attitude reflects the timorous reaction of lawyers in the Justice Department. Attorney General Edwin Meese asked Charles Cooper, head of the Office of Legal Counsel, to assess the Glazier article, and he produced a memo entitled &quot;Inherent Item Veto Authority of the President.&quot; While conceding that Clause 3 clearly prohibits Congress from circumventing the veto by labeling a bill as something else, he frets that it doesn't necessarily give the President the power to enforce this prohibition by deciding what is and is not vetoable. He notes that no President has previously asserted this power, though he neglects to mention that many Presidents have asserted the right to &quot;impound&quot; appropriated funds. That is, to take action equivalent to an item veto without an opportunity for Congress to override. The curtailing of the impoundment power and the 1974 budget act are what caused the budget process to spin out of control.    Mr. Cooper suggests that instead of blue-penciling items, the President follow the precedent of Rutherford Hayes, who vetoed five straight appropriations bills until Congress dropped non-germane riders, specifically saying in his veto messages his intent was to protect executive power. This would be fine, too, though President Hayes did not face a Congress that wrapped a whole year's legislation into one bill.    About advice like the Vice President received, Mr. Glazier makes a powerful point. &quot;What the executive needs on the Clause 3 Veto is advice from lawyers who act like advocates, not judges,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The executive needs advice on how to achieve the policies that the executive desires. The executive does not need advice from make-believe judges who want to rule, or from passive lawyers who say: (1) you cannot do it until we know what Clause 3 means, and (2) we cannot know what Clause 3 means until judges write rulings about it (when they know all along that no judge can rule until some President first acts in the name of Clause 3).&quot; Instead, the Founders intended that the executive would read the Constitution, find its rights and do whatever is necessary to enforce them.    Here's what an advocate would tell a President: What do you have to lose from trying the line-item veto? If anyone brings a challenge, the courts would probably reject the case as one for the political branches to fight out among themselves. If the courts did decide, there is a reasonable chance that you would get the item veto that 43 governors have. If the courts rule against you, the worst case is that you would have to ask for a constitutional amendment for the line-item veto, and you will have elevated the issue. And by the way, the only thing we need more than lawyers who act like lawyers is Presidents who act like Presidents. </TEXT></DOC>
