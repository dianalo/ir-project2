<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-51-0897 </DOCNO><TEXT>In recent years the share of thin film cells on the photovoltaics market(competing with crystalline silicon cells) has been increasing from 14to 37 per cent. Although originally designed for minor electrical performances,thin film cells are planned to be converted into larger modules. Theefficiency of larger cells is expected to be reaching more than 15 percent with costs reduced to the 1-dollar-per-watt-level. Along with systemsdrawings a survey informs about the state of development of photovoltaicthin film cells. Reference is made to the particular features of thecells, the increased efficiency of alloyed amorphous silicon, tandemcells on two glass plates, large and highly efficient tandem cells, thedegradation effect, fabrication, and alternative materials (allowingwith cadmium sulfide, copper-indium-disolenide, plasma deposition method,CdTe-500 C-technology, gallium arsenide). Provided that thin layers canbe produced cheaply, thin film cells will be playing an important rolein the future. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
