Hundreds of government opponents have received death threats asthe clandestine groups have become a major force of politicalrepression, the London-based international human rights group.   Amnesty said Chile's military government blames the attacks andthreats on ordinary criminals or independent extremist groups. Butit said there is ``convincing evidence'' they are in fact carriedout by groups linked to the security forces.   ``Evidence which has emerged through the courts, the groups'methods of operation, the impunity with which they operate and thevast resources available to them all clearly point to anassociation with the security forces and official condonement,''said the report.   In addition, it said, in rare instances, members of units havebeen photographed or otherwise identified as belonging to themilitary or police.   ``Anyone perceived as critical of government practices risksharassment and thousands live with the uncertainty of possibleabuse,'' the report said. ``Intimidation by clandestine groups isnow one of the most common methods of political persecution inChile.''   The report said intimidation by such groups began to spread in1983 following an increase in opposition demands for a return todemocracy.   The attacks have increased in the buildup to an Octoberpresidential referendum, it said. The military junta will choose asingle candidate for president, and voters will approve or rejectthat choice.   Victims of harassment or abuse have included political and tradeunion officials, human rights workers, community leaders in poorneighborhoods, bishops, lawyers, court officials, journalists andpolitical activists, Amnesty said.   The report cites 128 cases of intimidation, including that ofOscar Eloy Gomez, regional president of the Chilean Teachers'Association in the northern town of Arica and leader of a localcampaign for a no vote in the referendum.   In April, he was forced into a vehicle by unidentified men wholater fired shots at his feet, kicked and beat him and told him hewould get more of the same if he continued his activities.   Other victims have been given electric shocks, burned with hotmetal or acid, or had marks cut into their flesh, Amnesty said.   As well, hundreds of death threats have been sent, some withdrawings of coffins and skulls or accompanied by dead animals, itsaid.   Sergio del Solar, president of the Quilpue Humans RightsCommission, said he found a dead cat outside his home, its throatslit.   ``It was terrible,'' he was quoted as saying. ``All I couldthink of was to hide it so that my family wouldn't suffer.''   The report said that secret groups reportedly were behind the1987 disappearance of five political activists, the 1986 murder offour opposition politicians and three other deaths in 1985.   Amnesty said that although the government has said theseincidents will be investigated, ``not one of the hundreds of casesbrought to the attention of the courts resulted in any of theperpetrators being brought to justice.''   President Augusto Pinochet has ruled Chile since Sept. 11, 1973,when he led a military coup that toppled the government of electedPresident Salvador Allende, a Marxist.</TEXT></DOC>
