A spokesman for lead manager Nikko Securities Co. said Friday the number of shares for which customers have put in orders has already risen above the number of shares to be sold.    Subscriptions offically begin next Monday .    A spokesman for Nikko noted that the securities firms can sell the shares to the clients of their choice, but added that, &quot;We have instructed our branches to sell not only to customers they already have, but to sell (the new shares) widely.&quot;    He added that the Tokyo Stock Exchange has instructed Nikko to insure that the issue reaches a broad range of investors, and noted that investors are limited to 1,000 shares each.    The company is due to list its shares on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December. Ahead of that listing, the company will issues new shares in order to bring the total number of shares up to a level that meets the Exchange's requirement.    The new shares are priced at 850 yen each ($6.81). Nikko will handle 51% of the 70.354 million shares of the new issue. </TEXT></DOC>
