A test site was established in Albertawhere a total of 6 different water pumping windmills were installed during1983. Later, a solar pumping system and a small power generating windturbine were also installed on the site. All of the units were monitoredon a continuous basis during summer and fall of 1983 and 1984, with thegenerating unit monitored year round. A number of parameters were monitoredfor each of the water pumping turbines, with volume of water pumped relativeto wind speed considered the most important. For the solar unit, waterpumped versus solar radiation was considered important while for theelectrical unit, power output versus wind speed was measured. The resultsof this study, particularly the demonstration aspects, have far exceededexpectations. They showed considerable differences among the varioustypes of units. More importantly, however, the program points out thenecessity of relating the pumping performance of each machine to thewind regime data for a given region, in order to predict the true capabilityof a given wind turbine. The data also point out that wind turbine manufacturersshould put greater emphasis on designing machines to capture the lowend of the wind spectrum rather than attempting to maximize power atthe higher wind speeds. The data monitored at the Lethbridge test sitewas based on International Energy Agency wind turbine testing standards,and can be extrapolated and utilized throughout most of the world. 14refs., 36 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
