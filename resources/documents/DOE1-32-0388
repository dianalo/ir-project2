The applications of an on-line rapidanalyzer in the mining industry include quality assurance, sorting whichis based on measurement of variable quality coal and sorting into twoor more piles, blending can be achieved by controlling the amounts oflow and high quality coals using the least amount of the more valuableblend component and preparation plant control allowing operations toadjust the gravity continuously to maximize yield for a specified quality.On-line rapid analyzers range from less than 200,000 dollars for gammaash meters to more than 300,000 dollars for PGNAA instruments.</TEXT></DOC>
