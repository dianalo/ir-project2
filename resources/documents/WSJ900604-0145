From the front of the gatehangs the usual portrait of Mao Tse-tung, commanding thesquare. All around are public security agents to ensure therewill be no democratic turmoil to interfere with your climb tothe Tiananmen balcony above. There, the grandeur of China ison show. Under Tiananmen's imperial yellow roof, lookingsouth across the huge square, you can stand where Mao stoodin 1949 when he founded his communist People's Republic anddeclared, &quot;The Chinese people have stood up.&quot;   Then you can descend to the street where last June 4 theChinese people were shot down.</LP><TEXT>   This first anniversary of the Tiananmen uprising, Beijingwears a tidy facade that makes it easy to forget the heroicevents of last year. There's a big official effort on tospruce up the city for the Asian Games, to be held here inSeptember. Pictures of the panda mascot decorate shops andbillboards. Where tanks rolled toward Tiananmen Square theroads have been mostly repaved, the sidewalks relaid, theshops replastered.   Where protesters shouted and waved banners for democracy,it's now hard to strike up even a casual conversation. TheChinese know that anyone seen speaking with foreigners canexpect to be questioned by security agents. With the publicheld hostage, the government is slathering on a cosmeticsmile. The Public Security Bureau, last year besieged byangry workers, now keeps its gates wide open and adorns itssteps with red, purple and yellow potted flowers. Hotels havebeen ordered to fly red banners that say &quot;Greeting guestswith smiles and hospitality.&quot; They have also been suppliedwith computers that tie in to the Public Security Bureau --to better keep track of the guests. Tiananmen Square has beenclosed for this anniversary. But mostly the square is openagain, even after dark, to anyone who cares to share it witharmed police guards.   Coming up from Hong Kong this past week, I thought itimportant to avoid harking back too much to last year'srevolt. The big question is what might lie ahead. Butrevisiting this tightly controlled city, I see that lastyear's uprising offered the best clue to China's future. Itwas only during those few weeks that the Chinese were able tosidestep their government, talk openly with each other, andtell the world what they wanted for their country.   The details of mass revolts are rarely simple, and therehas been much debate outside China this past year overprecisely what the demonstrators hoped to achieve. But onething is clear: Just as Mao in the 1920s had a vision thateventually led to his 1949 victory, these people also had adream. The flag that flew from a building near the squaresaid &quot;democracy.&quot; And the white statue that for five daysfaced off against the portrait of Mao, and came to symbolizethe movement, stood for liberty.   This is crucial to remember. It tells us what the peopleof Beijing were willing to die for. I have often heard itargued this past year that all the demonstrators reallywanted were honest officials and greater freedom of speech --not the overthrow of the Communist Party. Yes, they demandedan end to corruption and lies. But an end to corruption andlies means the end of the Communist Party'sself-justification for existence. No one knows this betterthan the Chinese people, whose insistent cry last spring was&quot;Tell the truth.&quot;   The prime truth in China today is that communism hasproved itself a costly fraud. The Chinese people rank amongthe poorest in the world, as well as among the mostrepressed. The vaunted stability conferred by the party isalso an illusion. There is no provision for orderlysuccession, there are no independent institutions of law. Noone knows what might happen when 85-year-old Deng Xiaopingdies or fades away. Nor is it clear what post his successormight occupy, since Mr. Deng resigned his last official postearlier this year. China's government is one of the leaststable on earth.   It is also one of the most hated. The wide avenues ofBeijing offer a reminder that last year's movement --accompanied by demonstrations in scores of cities acrossChina -- was no simple student protest. It was a mass revolt.To block the army from entering Beijing required citizensready to occupy the streets for miles in every direction --for two solid weeks. When they rushed out at virtually everymajor intersection to face gunfire and armored personnelcarriers during the final showdown, they were not protectingtheir homes. They were protecting what they knew was thesoldiers' target -- Tiananmen Square, and the goal of freedomthat it stood for.   For now, China is back to communism as usual, with PartySecretary Jiang Zemin grinning in a Barbara Walters interviewand dismissing the Tiananmen revolt as &quot;much ado aboutnothing.&quot; Deng Xiaoping, dictator to one-fifth of humanity,makes his erratic appearances to scotch rumors that he isdead. Premier Li Peng hates bourgeois liberal ways, butwelcomes President Bush's decision to renewmost-favored-nation trading status with China. President YangShangkun takes time away from overseeing the ideologicalpurification of the People's Liberation Army to tour SouthAmerica and announce that he's found lots of friends there.   None of these party leaders speaks for the people ofChina. Nor do they offer any grand plan that might lurepeople their way. Thanks to its infiltration of the army andthe local work units, the 47 million member party creaks on,resurrecting its absurd model heroes and cookbook slogans.&quot;Better Red than expert&quot; is one of the latest mottoes of thearmy, where professional soldiering officially ranks secondto politically correct thinking. But Mao's vision of a nationstriving to build the New Socialist Man stirs almost no one.It had shriveled long before the Chinese army fired onChina's people last year.   To build socialism, the Chinese endured the horrors of theGreat Leap Forward in the late 1950s and the CulturalRevolution from 1966 to 1976, in which tens of millions diedand hundreds of millions suffered. They emerged from thishell in the late 1970s to see their noncommunist neighborsenjoying the Asian economic miracle. And that was what theywanted. &quot;Take your Diogenes lamp and go wandering aroundlooking for a true communist. It will be hard to find oneunder 50 years old,&quot; says one Western diplomat based here.   The government has no coherent plan to reform thefaltering system. Late last year the party spat forth oldStalinist cant about replacing market reforms with strictcentral planning. Farm enterprises, where freer markets hadserved as the main force for development this past decade,were to be rubbed out. Credit and raw materials were to berechanneled mainly to unprofitable state enterprises.   Now, after almost a year of no economic growth, the partyhas backed off and is again making noises about a &quot;managed&quot;private economy. But the two vital steps of freeing pricesand institutionalizing property rights have been scratchedfrom this leg of the long march. China's economic policiesare adrift. The main think tanks, where some of the country'sbrightest people were planning the moves toward a marketeconomy, have been broken up. And political reform is dead inthe water.   This is a vacuum that cannot last. It may be that the fuseof the next revolt is burning far from Tiananmen Square,where the regime will not lightly allow people to gatheragain. The next firestorm may begin in the richer, coastalprovinces of Guangdong or Fujian, which trade heavily withthe outside world and want nothing to do with China's centralgovernment. It could begin with the Moslems in the westernprovince of Xinjiang, where at least 22 people died lastmonth in a separatist revolt and the Beijing government hasstepped up its &quot;security measures.&quot; It could start in thesouthwestern city of Chengdu, where unemployment combinedwith anger over the Beijing massacre ignited riots last June.Or in Shanghai, where protesters last spring built their ownStatue of Liberty, and backed down only under serious threatof martial law.   How long before China rises again is hard to say. But itmust come soon. Tiananmen disclosed publicly what most peopleknew: that China's communists have outlived their time. Theyhave nothing left to offer a country that has been strugglingsince the start of this century to join the modern world. Andthough China's people lack a detailed agenda, they havealready replaced Mao's communist vision with their call inTiananmen Square for democracy.   This is a country whose long history dwarfs many of theworld's great events. But the world outside is moving fasterthan ever before. Observing the prosperity of the West,following the overthrow of communism in Eastern Europe, theupheavals in the Soviet Union, and even Burma's vote a weekago for democracy, the Chinese people know how badly they arefalling behind. They need not reinvent the institutions ofdemocracy; they need only seize the chance to adopt them.   The tragedy of June 4 went far beyond the killing in thestreets. The tragedy is that such movements do not alwayssucceed the first time, and every day lost means furtherwaste of the great nation that China could be. When Ireturned from Beijing last June, after watching that fiercestruggle for freedom, a friend up there sent down a poem,entitled &quot;Spring Dawn,&quot; by an eighth-century Chinese poet,Meng Haoran. It speaks today not only for a people silentlymourning its loss at Tiananmen, but also for a nationstruggling to awake:                                                                                                          Oversleeping in spring I missed the dawn,   Now everywhere the cries of birds are heard.   Tumult of wind and rain had filled the night --   How many blossoms fell during the storm?   ---   Miss Rosett is editorial page editor of The Asian WallStreet Journal.
