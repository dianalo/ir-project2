Wednesday's &quot;Firing Line&quot; debate among GOP presidential hopefuls stood that line on its head. The six candidates had a lively exchange of views, punctuated by genuine flashes of wit. Especially noteworthy was how little the Republican candidates distanced themselves from President Reagan, whose presidency has been severely attacked in recent days. Indeed those who raised differences largely felt that the President had not done enough to further his agenda.    The Beltway is in full shriek for a tax increase, but the candidates felt little need to bow before conventional wisdom. All opposed punitive tax increases as well as protectionism. Perhaps in their treks through Iowa county fairs and New Hampshire shopping malls, they've found there isn't much grass-roots support for &quot;recessionomics.&quot; Al Haig even launched a full-scale attack on Congress's institutional breakdown.    In all, the candidates displayed a refreshing feistiness. It would be nice to think that Labor Secretary William Brock's tough words on the trade bill earlier in the day mean the spirit is catching in the administration. Secretary Brock, who leaves the cabinet shortly to head Senator Dole's campaign, said at the AFL-CIO convention that the trade bill now before Congress would cause &quot;rampant panic&quot; in the markets and that the &quot;authors of the legislation should seriously consider withdrawing it and backing off.&quot; The labor leaders were aghast that anyone, even a Republican, would so directly challenge political orthodoxy on this issue.    Several of the GOP candidates in the debate came up with concrete ideas on what should be done to build on President Reagan's accomplishments. Vice President Bush supported a cut in the capital-gains-tax rate to 15%, a move that would help stabilize jittery markets and, if the past is any guide, raise revenue. Rep. Jack Kemp advocated enterprise zones and the sale of public-housing units to tenants. Pat Robertson pointed out the negative economic and demographic effects that unrestrained abortion will have on Social Security. Pete du Pont would phase out farm subsidies, allow IRA-type private accounts to supplement Social Security and open up public schools to competition through a voucher program.    But perhaps most remarkable of all was how little respect most of the candidates displayed for the reigning theology of arms control. All, save for Vice President Bush and Senator Dole, sharply criticized the proposed INF agreement. The Vice President made the best argument possible for a flawed proposal, but he incorrectly claimed it would &quot;take out 1,600 Soviet warheads for 400 of ours&quot; when in reality only the missiles would be destroyed. The treaty doesn't require the destruction of the nuclear warheads.    The debate displayed the talents of six confident candidates. Clearly none has been spooked by recent events into running away from the principles that twice elected Ronald Reagan. </TEXT></DOC>
