Bush: I don't know, Maureen. I don't think so, if the recordspeaks for itself. If I'd have selected somebody out of thepolitical arena that had never been on the bench and never had anyexperience but was in my view well qualified, there might well havebeen more intervention on my part. I'm prepared to do whatever isappropriate in not only defending but advocating this confirmation,but I don't believe there's going to be a lot of personalinvolvement necessary because I think his record and his standingwill speak for itself.   Yes?   Q: Mr. President, I've got to make one more try. You say it'sinappropriate to ask, but you also admit there is a lot ofbackground paperwork on someone. Judge Souter was appointed to theNew Hampshire court by Governor Sununu, whose feelings on abortionare well known. Your feelings on abortion are well known. Whyshould we not believe that that is a factor in your selection?   Bush: Because I've told you it's not, and because you ought tolisten to the testimony in the Hill, and then you can make up yourmind better when you've seen the evidence. And that _ I expectpeople will be raising this question. I've seen a lot ofspeculation on it over the last 48 hours or whatever it was sinceJustice Brennan retired. But I'm telling you _ you asked me what myview was _ and I've told you how I approach this matter, and that'sall I can do.   Yes?   Q: Mr. President, you said a moment ago that there are Senateprecedents on how questioning happens in the Judiciary Committee.In fact, there are two very contrasting precedents. There was theBork precedent, where the nominee answered all sorts of questions,and there was the Justice O'Connor-Justice Kennedy precedent, inwhich the nominee declined to an lot of specific questions abouthow the nominee felt. Do you have any preference about how yournominee handles these questions?   Bush: No, but I have confidence my nominee will handle itproperly, and he's _ look, the man is a judge on an appeals court.He knows how to treat with this, and the Senate is a free Senate,and they know how to treat with it. So that _ I'm not going to getinto that. I think it's inappropriate for a President to do thatkind of thing.   Q: Do you tt's appropriate for a nominee to answer specificquestions about how he might rule on _   Bush: I would leave, and let the Senate make the finaldetermination.   Yes? Were there one or two aspects of the judge's backgroundthat _ alifications that particularly brought him to th Bush: Beingbright, extraordinarily bright and then a record foess,extraordinarily fair. Well, I've made my judgment based _ you'veasked me what I decided ifications that I think are essential. PlusI gave you the underpinning, which I want somebody that is notgoing to be a legislator sitting on the Supreme Court.   Yeah? And then Ann.   Q: Did you meet Judge Souter before you made this decision otherthan the last couple of days?   Bush: Yes, just within the last couple of days.   Q: _ the first time you've ever seen him?   Bush: First time I'd met him. And who knows, the amounI spent inNew Hampshire I might well have seen him. But I _ (laughter) we'vebeen, as I have indicated, been talking to our attorney general andBoyden Gray on resumes, or on records for a long, long time. Andthe man is very highly regarded, so _ but I _ no, I just had ashort visit with Judge Souter today and, obviously, was quiteimpressed.   Yes, Ann?   Q: You had already decided at that point, sir?   Bush: No, I had not decided, and that's the truth _ as iseverything else I said here. (Laughter.) Yeah Q: In _ in speakingto your advisors about resumes and records, as you say, did you askyour advisors to produce only nominees who had no extensive writtenrecord on the abortion issue _   Bush: No.   Q: _ that _ (inaudible) _ more candidates who would not provokea large debate over _   Bush: No.   Yeah, Owen?   Q: I wonder if you can you tell me, how is it possible to makethe selection without reviewing the judge's record or a summary ofhis record that dealt with sic cases, if not abortion, affirmativeaction, civil rights issues, free speech _ a lot of the emotionalissues that the country is very concerned about?   Bush: Most of hve been at the state level and the _ the _ I madethe decision based on the criteria that I gave you.   Q: So you're telling us that you have no idea what his judicialopinions are on abortion, affirmative action and civil rights, flagburning?   Bush: I'm telling you that you should stay tuned and let thetestimony before the United States Senate determine whether he'sconfirmed or not, and that that ll bring out all the questions thatyou're aski And the answers, that's up to the judge to see how heshould hhat as one who is going to have to deal with a lot ofissues in future.   Yeah?   Q: Mr. President, has Gnor Sununu, who is well acquainted withthe nominee, given you reading on the Judge's views oncontroversial issues?   Bush: No, there's _ no. No.   Way in the back.   Q: (Inaudible).   Q: Am I</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
