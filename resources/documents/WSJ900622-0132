PETERSBURG -- Lenin must be turning in his mausoleum.His hometown is leading the fight for the democratic Russiahe hijacked 73 years ago. A year from now Leningrad couldeven have a new old name.   A first-time visitor has no claim to expertise, but oneway to learn is to spend a few hours listening to Leningrad'sbrave new democrats. Peter Gumbel, the Journal's Moscowbureau chief and a real expert, said I should expect to hearradical voices (by Soviet standards). He wasn't kidding. InLeningrad these days, it's possible in a single afternoon tomeet social democrats, Christian democrats,&quot;anarcho-syndicalists&quot; (libertarians), Russian nationalists,and Greens -- and later that day to discuss the czar's gloryyears with a neo-monarchist.</LP><TEXT>   But this is no political Tower of Babel. At center stageare committed, coherent reformers attempting to take powerfrom the Communist Party to yank Mikhail Gorbachev towarddemocracy. These Democrats are wary allies of the populistbut enigmatic Boris Yeltsin in his battles with thegovernment. They're the Russians that Jim Baker and the U.S.State Department never seem to mention.   I met with several of them, including a young radicalnamed Alexey Kovalyov. He's 26 years old, handsome,articulate and he detests the communists. He and his wifestill live with their parents, while they wait the 10 to 15years it takes to get their own apartment. Their flat is tinyand dark, but the tea is hot and the conversationilluminating. As an archaeologist out of Leningrad Universityhe could not find a job in his field. So he went to work as amuseum guide and revolutionary.   This March he ran with the Democratic Front that swept tovictory here in the first genuine election in Soviet history.Of 380 seats in the city soviet (city council), democratstook three-fourths. In Moscow, democrats took half. Reformersalso won big in Kiev, Lvov and many other cities. Suddenly,the Soviet Union has leaders elected by real voters. (Mr.Gorbachev settled for indirect election to the presidency bythe national Congress of People's Deputies, a third of whomare Communist-appointed.)   One of the new leaders is the Leningrad council chairman,Anatoly Sobchak, a lawyer and people's deputy who wowsnational TV viewers with his calls for independent courts anda nonpolitical KGB. Mr. Kovalyov is a Sobchak reformer.   These are my kind of Russians. Mr. Kovalyov wants privateproperty, free markets, and laws that apply to everyoneequally. Other reformers are less fervent free marketeers,but the Swedish model seems to be the most socialism anyreformer can still tolerate. Mr. Sobchak talks of building anew &quot;civil society,&quot; subject to law and separate frompolitics. Most democrats would let the Baltics and otherrebel republics go their own way. Economic progress mattersmore to them than political dominance.   This week the Leningrad reformers are debating a &quot;freeeconomic zone&quot; -- trade with the Baltics, Finland or anynation that is interested. But what if Moscow objects? &quot;Theparty didn't imagine a noncommunist mayor of Leningrad,&quot;laughs Alexander Schelkanov, the new mayor and reformer.&quot;That doesn't mean the people cannot do it.&quot;   All of which has the comrades at proletariat headquartersglum. The communists still have the best offices in town, andthey still look good in special-order foreign suits, but theylack the old Bolshevik elan. (It's an irony of socialism thatthe scarcity it produces has made even the smallest foreignsymbol a sign of status; Lenin's revolution is beingsubverted by the Lacoste alligator.)   Oleg Kuzin, the number two man for ideology, toes the newparty line about &quot;reform&quot; within socialism, but he'sdefensive about it. He can't understand why his team waswiped out in the March vote. Perhaps he hasn't met the taxidrivers here who refer to communists as the &quot;Russian mafia.&quot;Of course, he also knows the party still controls the meansof production, as well as central Soviet government.   Mr. Kovalyov says democracy is now a political force inthe Soviet Union that won't go away. &quot;It is important todestroy the myth that Gorbachev is the only guarantee ofdemocracy,&quot; he says. Mikhail the Improviser will always headfor the political middle. Reformers must keep redrawing themiddle line until Mr. Gorbachev steps over it and endorses atruly democratic system. Gorby still has another chance tojoin the democrats at the 28th Communist Party Congress intwo weeks. The party may split and if Mr. Gorbachev sideswith the right wing, &quot;that will be his last mistake. No onewill listen to him any more,&quot; Mr. Kovalyov says.   A democratic Russia, it is obvious enough, won't come soonor easily. The communist apparat, the military, the extremenationalists -- none will hand over power without a fight.Mr. Kovalyov may be naive about his prospects, butrevolutions are not made by pessimists.   Naive or not, these are the Russian patriots Americanshave long hoped might come to power. They want to completewhat Gorbachev started but is now hesitant to finish. Ademocratic Russia wouldn't devote a third of its economy tothe military or donate $5 million a year to Latin dictators.   It makes sense when the reformers say that Western aid tothe U.S.S.R. should be linked to further democratic progress.They understand, as some Americans do not, that the currentSoviet system is so corrupt it must be swept completely away.Their goal is not to sustain or co-exist with Lenin's heirs,but to bury them.</TEXT></DOC>
