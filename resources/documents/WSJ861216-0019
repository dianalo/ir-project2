The justices will hear arguments in an appeal filed jointly by R. Foster Winans; his former roommate David Carpenter, a one-time news clerk at the Journal; and Kenneth Felis, a former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. stockbroker.    The convictions of the three men stemmed from a stock-trading scheme based on advance information about &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; columns in the Journal. Mr. Winans wrote some of those columns during 1983 and 1984.    The circumstances of the Winans case are far different from other recent insider-trading cases. But now that the justices have agreed to review it, the case presents the Supreme Court with an important opportunity to define just how far federal securities law goes in prohibiting securities trading using information that isn't public.    The convictions of Messrs. Winans and Felis, for mail and wire fraud, as well as securities fraud, were upheld by a federal appeals court in New York last May. The appeals court also affirmed Mr. Carpenter's conviction for aiding the fraud.    Mr. Winans was sentenced to 18 months in prison and was fined $5,000. Mr. Felis was ordered to serve a six-month jail sentence on weekends and to pay a $25,000 fine. Mr. Carpenter was fined $1,000 and was placed on probation for three years.    The sentences for all three individuals have been stayed while their appeal is pending. The case probably won't be argued until next October, and won't be decided until early 1988.    The decision to hear the appeal was surprising because the Justice Department had urged the high court to bypass it and leave the convictions intact. The court takes the department's advice in the majority of appeals of federal criminal convictions.    But the court may have agreed to hear the Winans case to clarify a controversial theory of securities fraud, called misappropriation, on which the convictions were based.    Insider-trading cases traditionally have involved individuals who obtained secret information from publicly traded companies or company executives. Federal securities law prohibits stock trading based on material, nonpublic information.    In recent years, however, insider-trading cases have sometimes involved people who are quite remote from companies that are the subject of inside information. Since 1980, the Supreme Court has suggested, without being specific, that such cases might involve &quot;misappropriation&quot; or illegal use of information. A decision in the Winans case may help define securities fraud by misappropriation.    The theory in the Winans case is that advance information about the columns and when they were to be published constituted insider information that was used illegally or was misappropriated from the Journal. This conduct, the lower federal courts said, violated the Journal's own conflict-of-interest policy and federal securities law.    Lawyers for Mr. Winans and the other defendants argued at trial and on appeal that although their clients' conduct may have violated Journal policy, it didn't violate federal law.    The appeal to the Supreme Court picked up some high-powered support along the way. The Securities Industry Association, a trade association, urged the justices to hear the case &quot;to eliminate the substantial confusion&quot; created by the appeals court ruling. The association said that broker-dealers in arranging transactions must now worry about whether clients owe duties to third parties to refrain from using information.    The association's stance caused considerable consternation among its member firms, according to Wall Street sources. &quot;The SIA is an industry organization,&quot; said one source. &quot;The staff filed a brief without anybody in the industry knowing about it. It isn't our policy to go against the government in a criminal case.&quot;    In New York, William Fitzpatrick, the association's general counsel, assured that the staff would obtain the approval of the association's board and member firms before it makes any further moves. &quot;We aren't attacking the Securities and Exchange Commission's misappropriation theory,&quot; he said. &quot;But we're afraid they're stretching the theory too far in this case.&quot;    The appeal was also backed by some news media trade groups, including the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the National Association of Broadcasters. The media groups said the appeals court's expansion of insider-trading law &quot;interferes with the editorial process of the print media protected by the First Amendment.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
