BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines said it was boosting itsEuropean service overall but delaying some new services and cuttingcertain existing routes because it doesn't have enough airplanes.   In addition to London routes gained in recent deals with TWA andTexas Air Corp., American said Thursday it would add nonstopflights from Chicago to Glasgow, Scotland, and to Munich andDusseldorf in West Germany.   The expansion gives the Fort Worth-based carrier 145 flights aweek to Europe, a 22 percent increase.   ``We believe the restructuring will make us a stronger, morevibrant competitor in the European market place,'' said MikeBuckman, vice president of sales. ``We're determined to makeAmerican the leading U.S. carrier in the European market.''   Analyst Mark Daugherty with Dean Witter Reynolds said the move``just underscores their aggressive ambitions to secure andimplement U.S.-European service prior to 1992,'' when Europe hopesto abolish most internal trade barriers.   American also announced it has applied to the U.S. Department ofTransportation for six routes between the United States and Japan.The routes are: Chicago-Tokyo, Chicago-Nagoya, Los Angeles-Tokyo,Los Angeles-Nagoya, San Jose-Tokyo and San Jose-Nagoya.   With the European expansion, Buckman said internationaloperations will amount to about 15 percent of the carrier'sbusiness.   In separate deals last month, American, the nation's biggestdomestic carrier, bought the Chicago-to-London route authority ofTrans World Airlines Inc. and the Miami-to-London route flown byTexas Air's Continental Airlines. The Continental route was a smallpart of an overall $471 million deal with Texas Air to buy theLatin American routes and some other assets of Eastern Airlines.   Federal authorities still must approve those deals. Pan AmericanWorld Airways has challenged the Eastern deal.   While boosting European service overall, American will dropcurrent non-stop service to Frankfurt and Lyon, France, from NewYork, and cease one-stop flights to Stuttgart and Hamburg, WestGermany, and Geneva, Switzerland.   American also is delaying previously announced plans to fly fromChicago to Helsinki, Finland, and Warsaw, Poland, and fromDallas-Fort Worth to Barcelona, Spain.   ``We're anxious to service those cities,'' Buckman said, but``we don't have the long-range, `over water' aircraft required.''</TEXT></DOC>
