Before his abrupt resignation, Mr. O'Brien becameembroiled in the federal criminal investigation of Pentagonprocurement fraud and corruption involving Long Island-basedcompanies, according to defense and law-enforcementofficials. The grand jury inquiry began in Uniondale, N.Y.,more than a year ago, according to these officials, but inthe past few months investigators stepped up their interestin Mr. O'Brien and his activities.</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors have questioned witnesses and collecteddocuments related to his involvement with the late JamesKane, a Long Island businessman who helped run anow-disgraced political lobbying group representing areadefense firms.   Other individuals associated with Mr. Kane funneledthousands of dollars of illegal campaign contributions tovarious lawmakers during the 1980s, according toinvestigators and court documents filed by the government.Messrs. O'Brien and Kane were friends, according tolaw-enforcement officials, and prosecutors are trying todetermine whether Mr. O'Brien had a role in the operation ofthe lobbying group, called Long Island Aerospace PoliticalAction Committee.   Mr. Kane's name originally surfaced two years ago as partof a broader Alexandria, Va., grand jury investigation ofPentagon bribery and influence-peddling. A search warrantissued at the time for one of Mr. Kane's companies asked formaterial &quot;pertaining to schemes&quot; to &quot;extort campaigncontributions&quot; from certain defense contractors. Federalagents also sought documents &quot;relating to the ownership ofstock certificates&quot; or other &quot;things of value&quot; that may havebeen given to public officials by one of Mr. Kane's companiesor associates.   Federal investigators, among other things, are now tryingto determine whether Mr. O'Brien, members of his family orother current or former Grumman officials received loans orother benefits from Mr. Kane or his firms, according to lawenforcement officials. A member of the law firm representingGrumman declined to comment.   In May, a former shipping manager at Grumman's aerospaceunit pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud thegovernment by submitting to the Pentagon $300,000 of bogusbills submitted by a subcontractor controlled by Mr. Kane.The former Grumman manager is cooperating with prosecutors.   Previously, Grumman has maintained that it isn't a targetof either grand jury investigation. Company spokesmen onFriday declined to comment on the matter.   Meanwhile, Grumman's new chairman said the Bethpage, N.Y.,maker of jet fighters won't change course. Renso L. Caporalisaid his first priority is &quot;to try to convince everyone thatthe change at Grumman is not so radical.&quot; Mr. Caporali, whoalso succeeds Mr. O'Brien as chief executive officer andpresident, said he plans &quot;a continuation of the agenda thatmy predecessor was pushing so hard&quot; at Grumman.   Topping that agenda is an effort to reduce Grumman's sizein line with decreasing defense spending. &quot;The downwardpressure (in defense spending) is going to be on everyone (inthe industry) and the only way to deal with it is to getyourself into fighting trim,&quot; Mr. Caporali said. Last month,Grumman announced it would offer early-retirement incentivesto 6,000 employees, or 21% of its work force, to cut costs.   Grumman's announcement of the management change said thatMr. Caporali will serve in his new duties while the boardconsiders other candidates for the positions, both frominside and outside the company. However, the new chairmansaid &quot;I hope to stay in the job permanently.&quot; Mr. Caporali,the former vice chairman, technology, said the likely insidecandidates would be Grumman's other vice chairman, Robert G.Freeze, and the heads of the major divisions.   Mr. Caporali said he first learned he would be assumingthe company's leadership a week before the announcement.</TEXT></DOC>
