The Mine Safety and Health Administration, a Labor Department unit, reported 63 fatalities in coal mining for 1987, down from 88 deaths in 1986. This was the lowest total since coal-mine deaths were first recorded in 1869. It was also the first time on record that no coal-mine accidents killed more than one miner, the safety agency said.    But deaths in other kinds of mines rose last year to 67 from 49 in 1986, hitting the highest level in three years, the mine-safety agency said. </TEXT></DOC>
