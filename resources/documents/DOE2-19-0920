For this computer models are available. Possible failures (numericaldispersion or oscillations) can influence the calculated efficiency.To study the influence of these failures the model SWIP (Survey WasteInjection Program) has been used. This model is verified at an analyticsolution and at storage project measurements. The effect of a complexexcavation field, used in large storage systems, on the efficiency hasquantified, as well as the effect of a regional ground water flow onthe efficiency. As far as possible the available methods to calculatethe effect of different variables on the efficiency are indicated. 23figs., 20 refs., 16 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
