There aren't many countries with all these perceived virtues,but one that does _ Chile _ has had a virutally unbroken record ofpoor relations with the United States for 15 years.   This seemingly anomalous situation has occurred because ofChile's military president, Augusto Pinochet, whose human rightsabuses and distrust for democracy have more than offset aspects ofhis rule which generally get an approving nod from Washington.   Lately, the Reagan administration has adopted a friendlier viewtoward Pinochet now that many civil liberties have been restored asthe country gears up for a presidential plebiscite next month inwhich the 72-year-old general will be the lone candidate.   Top military commanders announced their selection of Pinochet onTuesday, touching off a wave of protests that led to the deaths ofat least three people and the arrests of more than 1,000 others.   While the United States has kept its distance, diplomatically,from the general for years, Pinochet himself has been scornful ofWashington, telling American visitors that U.S. leaders should bemore appreciative of a government that deposed a Marxist-ledregime, an event virtually without precedent.   Indeed, some American officials, citing Pinochet's economic andforeign policies, believe long years of Reagan administrationhostility toward Chile was misguided.   As an example, with the exception of Honduras, Chile sided withthe United States on more U.N. votes than any other Latin Americancountry during the last General Assembly session. Among all ThirdWorld nations, only Turkey and Honduras were more supportive ofWashington's positions.   Beyond that, while other hemispheric countries are mired ineconomic crisis, Chile boasted a healthy 5.4 percent growth ratelast year, using market-oriented policies the U.S. advocates.   And unlike many other hemispheric countries, Chile pays itsdebts, allows foreign investors to remit profits and has beenselling off state-run enterprises.   Also winning sympathy for Pinochet among some officials is thepresence of well-armed guerrilla groups which have staged repeatedterrorist attacks over the years.   But at a time when the United States has been emphasizingdemocractic development in the hemisphere, the administration feltit could not make an exception by showing friendship towardPinochet.   The administration's attempts to promote democracy in Nicaraguawould lose credibility if Chile were exempted from this policy,officials contended, overriding those who favored greaterrecognition of the positive side of Pinochet's rule.   Beyond that, the Democratic majority in Congress, many of whomhave bitter memories of the early years of the Pinochet regime,strongly oppose any accommodation with Chile.   Whatever gratitude Pinochet generated in Washington for oustingPresident Salvador Allende in 1973 was short-lived because of wayhe dealt with those who opposed him.   As outlined by Aryeh Neier, director of Americas Watch, a NewYork-based human rights group, there were a ``huge number'' ofkillings in Chile during those early years. ``Nobody knows theactual count,'' he says.   Some political activists disappeared without a trace and therewere widespread allegations that political detainees were tortured.   American alienation from Chile was aggravated when U.S.investigators blamed Chilean security agents for the 1976car-bombing death in Washington of a former top Allende aide,Orlando Letelier. This was one of the most notorious incidents ofinternational terrorism ever to occur on U.S. soil.   A decade ago, Chile was a major target of the fresh emphasis onhuman rights introduced by President Carter. Nowadays, the U.S.focus is on democracy in the hemisphere and, at long last, theprospect of the first genuine electoral test in Chile since 1973has induced hopes in Washington that representative democracy mayreturn to Chile.   Still, the long record of U.S. hostility toward Pinochetcontrasts sharply with the friendship the United Statesdemonstrated for years toward another Third World militarystrongman, President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan, who waskilled in a plane crash two weeks ago.   The records of both Zia and Pinochet on human rights aresimilar. For Washington, the difference is that Zia ruled astrategically important country and Pinochet doesn't.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for TheAssociated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
